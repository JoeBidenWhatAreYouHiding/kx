### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ALPHONSO_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Alphonso XIII of Bourbon, king from the moment of his birth in 1886, was, to popular contempt, restored to the throne of Spain in 1932. His second reign has been even more tumultuous than his first; republican, Carlist, and socialist dissidents all undermine his authority, and economic growth has stagnated. Spain, under Alphonso, has become a powder keg liable to explode."
POLITICS_JUAN_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Juan of Bourbon inherited a Spain divided, a Spain on the brink of the abyss. As the son and successor to the widely despised Alphonso, his reign will forever be marred by the specter of his father, but it is Juan, not Alphonso, who must lead Spain into a better future."
POLITICS_FRANSISCO_FRANCO_DESC:0 "General Fransisco Franco Bahamonde's widely noted charisma and uniquely Spanish machismo facilitated his quick ascension to leadership of the Acción Popular. Now Franco, as Spain's head of state, has the unenviable task of forging a broken nation anew. For such burden, none can deny that he is uniquely qualified."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_FERRER_DESC:0 "Miguel Cabanelles Ferrer, who commanded Spain's African colonial conscripts in the Rif war has risen to the forefront of Spanish politics through strict discipline and focus. He and his Falange Española, organised more like a paramilitary than a traditional political party, may be the only force capable of bringing some semblance of order to Spain."
POLITICS_GIL_ROBLES_QUINONES_DESC:0 "José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, a committed monarchist and militant Catholic, has risen to prominence in Spain. His firebrand speeches denouncing the Kingdom's enemies while extolling religious virtues might even appear radical to a Carlist; nonetheless, Quiñones stands defiantly at the helm of the troubled Spanish nation."
POLITICS_JAIME_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Jaime of Bourbon, second son of King Alphonso XIII, deaf and once considered likely to renounce any claim to the throne, has been crowned King of Spain. While not lacking in mental faculties, his reputation as an invalid precedes him. This unlikely King, however, must lead Spain into its uncertain future."
POLITICS_JAIME_BOURBON_FRANCE_DESC:0 "Jaime of Borbón, second son of King Alfonso XIII, deaf and once considered likely to renounce any claim to the throne, has managed the impossible with his coronation as King of both Spain and France. As King of Spain he rules as Jaime I, whilst in France he is known by the regnal name of Henri VI, but in everyday conversation many simply refer to him as King Jacques Henri."
POLITICS_CARLOS_PIO_DESC:0 "Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, Prince of Tuscany... now Carlos VIII of Spain. For the first time in over two centuries, a Habsburg is once again King of Spain. Carlos VIII was born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria and of his wife Blanca de Borbón y de Borbón-Parma. His mother was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain. Carlos VIII grew up in the Palais Toskana in Vienna, but moved to Barcelona at a young age. The youngest and furthest right of the Carlist claimants, Carlos VIII demonstrated his right-wing bona fides by joining a nationalist militia in Austria, participating in street fights against syndicalists from Vienna to Madrid. Now leader of the Carlists, Carlos VIII will restore Christ, Honor, and Tradition to Spain."

### Ideas ###
SPR_memories_of_the_republic:0 "Memories of the Republic"
SPR_memories_of_the_republic_desc:0 "On August 11th, 1932, the Second Spanish Republic came to an end, but the Republic lives on in the hearts of many Spaniards. While many malcontents harbour Carlist or Socialist sentiments, many political moderates, especially among military officers, wish to see the end of the incumbent Spanish monarchy. The open defiance of even the centrist elements of Spanish Kingdom are ever present in their continued use of Republican party names, and what little support Accion Popular may have had before the coup, it is now truly gone unless drastic measures are taken to rectify the rapidly crumbling situation."

SPR_illegitimate_republic:0 "Illegitimate Republic"
SPR_illegitimate_republic_desc:0 "Although the unpopular Spanish Monarchy has now been brought to an end, we still have a long way to go before our government is seen as legitimate."
SPR_social_breakdown:0 "Fractured Society"
SPR_social_breakdown_desc:0 "The prevalence of radical ideologies and political violence in Spain has led to popular fear and individual isolation. Many are afraid to even interact with neighbours and old friends. No society can function in this fashion."
SPR_social_breakdown_2:0 "Fractured Society"
SPR_social_breakdown_2_desc:0 "Our society has, in a small yet important way, begun to heal. It will take time to recover from the political turmoil still present."
SPR_social_breakdown_3:0 "Fractured Society"
SPR_social_breakdown_3_desc:0 "Our society has, in a small yet important way, begun to heal. It will take time to recover from the political turmoil still present. While stability is not yet guaranteed, Spanish society is no longer as fragmented as it once was."

SPR_new_jobs_idea:0 "Jobs for the People"
SPR_new_jobs_idea_desc:0 "Spain has implemented massive public infrastructure initiatives. Those who once found themselves without work now build roads, canals, and hold a plethora of previously unfilled positions. With unemployment trending increasingly downwards, Spain's many problems have been partially alleviated."
SPR_new_command:0 "A New Command"
SPR_new_command_desc:0 "Spain's military command structure was modelled on the German 'Oberste Heeresleitung', but the efficiency of the German General Staff was never realised.

SPR_propaganda_focus:0 "Radio Madrid"
SPR_propaganda_focus_desc:0 "Spain's radio networks remained underdeveloped in comparison to its neighbours due to years of political turmoil. Spain has recently established a network of radio towers and new state owned stations. This has led to a marked increase in military organisation."

SPR_navy_focus_idea:0 "Rule the Seas"
SPR_navy_focus_idea_desc:0 "Ships are essential for power projection. To facilitate an increase in naval production, Spain has invested heavily in the modernisation of its existing dockyards, and the construction of new naval production facilities."

sprd.12.t:0 "Spain Among Empires"
sprd.12.d:0 "Spain is in a relatively unique position when it comes to global alliances, as the nation has maintained a degree of neutrality from world affairs for the better part of a century. During the Carlist wars, British forces did intervene on the side of the liberal monarchists, but beyond that, Spain has kept out of alliances, partially because of a conscious decision to not get entangled in the affairs of empires and partially because of the internal instability of the nation. The nation does boast quite a bit of Germanophilia, with the many of Spain’s aristocrats looking up to the Germans and their mighty empire as inspiration, but there are also many powerful men, such as the liberal ally of king Alfonso XIII, Count of Romanones, who greatly sympathize with the cause of the Entente exiles. Much of Spain’s upper echelons did support Germany during the Weltkrieg, but it speaks volumes to Romanones’ influence that his Anglophilia helped keep Spain from taking a side in the war.\n\nOther powerful political figures such as José Calvo Sotelo and various members of the Spanish liberal elite such as Manuel Azaña, Augusto Barcia y Trelles and the ‘eminent liberal’ Salvador de Madariaga are all known to hold quite a bit of sympathy to the Canadians and French governments, though in the case of the liberals this comes mostly from a respect towards the democratic institutions and spirit of modernity that United Kingdom and French republic used to embody, not really the current rather authoritarian form the Entente has since taken. Perhaps the smallest clique of Spanish politicians sympathetic to world powers is the pro-Austrian group, led primarily by aristocrats with ties to the Habsburgs or men who take quite a bit of influence from Austrian politics, such as José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, who has always been a great admirer of the Austrian populist Engelbert Dollfuss. With all these factions vying for control within the Spanish state, many feel that it is only inevitable that Spain joins one of the larger alliances in the world, but some do hope that the nation maintains its tradition of neutrality even now when the greatest crisis of the nation has passed."
sprd.12.a:0 "Our bout of neutrality may be forced to end..."

sprd.14.t:0 "The State of the Spanish Industry"
sprd.14.d:0 "The Spanish economy may have survived the initial effects of the German stock market crash, but the deep slump the nation finds itself in needs more to fix it than simple austerity measures and emergency programs. Spain, as it stands, is a highly rural nation, with a great reliance on agrarian production and protectionist measures placed on said products. While the nation possesses a great deal of variety in its agriculture, with the regions of the Levantine Spain being some of the most abundant in their yearly yield of fruits, viticultural products, grain and vegetables. However, Spain has never been fully able to compete with other European nations when it comes to agricultural production, and even the vast fields of grain in Castile and La Mancha pale in comparison to the size and output of those in Ukraine or Germany.\n\nAs such, one would expect Spain to have hopped onto the train of industrial revolution to escape its grim perpetual place on the second place of agricultural size, but only the cities of Bilbao and Barcelona saw rapid expansion in industry during the 19th and early 20th century. Bilbao was helped by the great prominence of steel in the region, produced by Altos Hornos de Vizcaya, S. A among other companies. Barcelona could attribute much of its success to the prominence of shipping in the region, which helped grow the city’s industrial potential rather quickly. Today, Basque Country is still known for its great steel products, as well as weapons, civilian goods and even speciality products such as playing cards produced by Fournier in Vittoria.\n\nBarcelona has a very diverse industrial base but much of it revolves around consumer items and a degree of heavy industry, with new forays into automobile construction popping up all the time in the region. Rest of Spain floundered with the development of industry, and while attempts were made to build factories and foundries in Madrid, Sevilla and Oviedo, these were often half-hearted at best or sabotaged by political, economic or social unrest at the time. Yet now that Spain finds itself at the perfect opportunity to pursue industrial production, once more somewhat stable politically and with the rest of Europe gearing up for war, there is bound to be customers for Spanish products in abundance. Infrastructure projects in Galicia and Old Castile are well-underway, while regions previously untouched by much industry such as Salamanca and Andalusia are now seeing companies and cooperatives emerge to build up an industrial base from scratch. The way to the top will not be easy, but Spain is in a best possible situation to get there, if the political and economic will is there to facilitate it."

Much work lays ahead, as can be expected, but perhaps one day the regions of Spain can bask in similar admiration as those of Ruhr, Manchester or Marseille. Thanks to the efforts of the Spanish government, that day seems closer than ever before, and as the engine of Spanish industry churns forward, a newfound pride in Spain is reaching its citizens as well. The Industrial Revolution has finally reached Iberia."

However, it’d be a shame if only foreigners were able to make use of our guns, while our own army salivates at the thought of having such a capable weapon in their own hands. Awarding Astra a contract to produce weapons for the different branches of our armed forces is a no-brainer."

SPR_focus_on_the_home_front_desc:0 "Spain’s industry is very lopsided in terms of its production, with Barcelona and Bilbao being its only noteworthy industrial centers, the first one producing mainly textiles and the other one known for its metallurgic ores, as well as some shipbuilding scattered across the country and some military productions centers such as Oviedo, while the rest of the country is agricultural in nature. For the sake of true economic development for all of Spain, we must diversify our productive output and start producing machines, textiles, and other value-added goods of our own so that we can feed our own domestic demand and export higher-value products."

For this purpose, the Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval or SECN commissioned a new artillery workshop called La Naval in the town of Reinosa, Cantabria. This workshop has since become one of the backbones of Spanish military production, quickly diversifying from its original production of naval artillery to field artillery, coastal batteries, and others. Now, we must invest in expanding the workshop’s productive capacity, so that it may produce the cutting-edge equipment our army needs for our future endeavors, as well as create much needed jobs for the region."

It houses the La Vega arms factory, which for over a century has been one of the backbones of Spanish arms production. Nowadays, it is the main source of the Spanish Mausers that every foot soldier in our army dons. If we truly aim to have a modern and well-equipped army, it is imperative we increase its funding so it can increase its productive capacity as well as envision ways to improve upon current designs so our rifles are as up to date as can be."

SPR_new_industry_desc:0 "For a while it has been known that under the Galician soil, there have been vast resources of Tungsten, sometimes informally known across Spain as “black gold” due to its color and its economic potential once extracted.

SPR_expand_industry_1:0 "Industrial Revolution Reaches Castille"
SPR_expand_industry_1_desc:0 "Castille has for the past few centuries been the cultural center of Spain, and for as long as the Spanish Empire lasted, the center of the hispanosphere. Yet this cultural dominance hasn’t extended to economic dominance, as many of the outskirts of the region outside Madrid are still primarily agricultural and generally underdeveloped. If we are to reach the development of the rest of the continent, we must first start with the heartland of our realm."
SPR_expand_mines_1:0 "The Riches of Rio Tinto"
SPR_expand_mines_1_desc:0 "The Rio Tinto, or ‘tinted’ river, is a river that runs along southern Spain in the Andalusia region, famous for the many ores and minerals that dye its waters and give it its name. These minerals have been mined for thousands of years by the many civilizations that have inhabited the region and that made Iberia an attractive region for any empire that came across it. Recently however, a British-led consortium of families has owned the Rio Tinto Company Limited, taking the profits for themselves and even forming a mini colony of sorts. We should take back the company and the resources by any means necessary."

SPR_trade_focus:0 "Walk the Old Roads of Spice Once Again"
SPR_trade_focus_desc:0 "Before Spain became an all-encompassing empire, one of our main economic endeavors was that of the spice trade. In fact, it is well-known that Cristobal Colon’s voyage was started in the search for a route to the East Indies from where the spices came from, although he ended up finding the Americas, which kicked off the golden age of exploration and European colonization. Yet, even with our empire mostly gone, our European neighbours still crave for the many spices from Asia, and so perhaps we should walk the old roads of spice once again to provide a much sought after commodity."
SPR_trading_armada:0 "The Sooty Wealth of Asturias and Biscay"
SPR_trading_armada_desc:0 "Asturias is one of the most industrialized regions in all of Spain. While that has proven problematic in the past by creating an organized, experienced and militant workforce that orchestrated the Asturias revolt, we must not underestimate the region’s industrial capacity, whether it be coal mining, metallurgy, or others. Instead of fighting against Asturias, we must fight side by side with Asturias in the battle for a new and reinvigorated Spanish industry."
SPR_banking_focus:0 "The New Banking Capital of Europe?"
SPR_banking_focus_desc:0 "While Spain isn’t up to par with places such as Switzerland or Germany in terms of its banking prowess, there is still no shortage of big and influential banks in Spain. On the same note, there is no shortage of capital in the capitalist nations of Europe, most of which are joined together under Mitteleuropa much like we are. By relaxing our financial rules and providing certain incentives to outside capital, perhaps we could get a competitive advantage and set ourselves up on the path to becoming the new banking capital of Europe."

sprf.18.t:0 "An Offer for a Pacific Foothold"
sprf.18.desc:0 "Spanish interests in East Asia have been rather meagre since the late 1800s when the Philippines were so rudely taken from us by the Yanqui devils, but as Spain reasserts itself as a global power, the allure of the Orient has once more gripped the nation as German colonial products make it to Spanish stores. While some nationalist war hawks call for Spain tor reclaim the Philippines, others take a more rational stance on the matter. Representatives of Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas, a Spanish multi-national company that owns multiple shipping vessels and tobacco plantations in the islands, has suggested that Spain should seek ways to expand its trade in the Far-East. The company’s representatives suggest that Spain should open up trade dialogue with the Dutch East Indies, a large colony of the Netherlands that stretches from Malaysia to parts of Papua New Guinea, as the colony is the next logical step to expand Spanish trade into.\n\nWhile the Germans, Australasians and Japanese obviously also hold islands and trade outposts in the region, the Dutch are a very valuable trade partner not only because of the size of their Insulindian colony but also because of the Dutch propensity for neutrality, something which the other regional actors can hardly claim. As such, Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas board suggests offering an economic deal to the Dutch East Indies government, but some local Hispanists such as Andrés Soriano, a business magnate with a dual citizenship for Spain and Philippines, have suggested that Spain should outright buy a part of the Dutch colony if possible. While costly, it would grant Spain a foothold in the region that the nation has not had since the sale of the Islas Carolinas to Germany in late 1800s. Soriano suggest buying West Timor, given the islands close connection to Iberia as East Timor belongs to Portugal, though Soriano has claimed that the Dutch could be willing to sell the islands of Flores and Sumba as well."

SPR_agrarian_reform_desc:0 "Throughout the 19th century, different ideas for an agrarian reform were attempted in Spain, but only the Second Republic attempted one as more than just a half-hearted gesture towards the peasants. However, like with many things, the Republicans tried too hard and too fast, pushing for a reform that was incredibly controversial in Spain and polarized the republican-socialist coalition, with liberals finding the reforms too harsh and the socialists claiming them to be too lacking. We must avoid their pitfalls while still finding ways to improve the lives of Spain’s farmers and peasants."
SPR_new_initiatives:0 "Revisiting Republican Initiatives"

While our current administration will never adopt such extreme measures as posited in the 1932 Agrarian Reform bill, which would have seen almost socialist levels of land seizure, other ideas such as the creation of an Ministry of Agrarian Affairs, the massive improvements to be done to Spain’s agrarian tooling, expansion of the irrigation systems and overhauling the local conditions of agriculture are all worthy ideas worth reconsidering."

By starting the move towards canned products, domestic production of equipment and improved methods, we can increase our output, produce higher quality and longer lasting products, and also create jobs in the manufacturing sector."
SPR_mass_production_of_farming_equipment:0 "The Final Bastion of Roman Plough Crumbles"
SPR_mass_production_of_farming_equipment_desc:0 "The plough is a simple tool and yet has been fundamental to agriculture for the past few millennia. It is a frame with a blade that is used to turn over the soil and bring the nutrients back to the top while burying weeds and the remains of the previous crop, almost always dragged by a farm animal. With very few developments over the course of history except for a few regional variations, it was made obsolete when the industrial revolution brought about steam engines which could power tractors that could pull the ploughs. And yet… Spanish farmers still use this outdated tool due to a lack of access to modern tractors. We must increase domestic tractor production and set up cooperatives and agricultural banks to facilitate farmers’ access to them. While it may have outlived the Roman Empire twice, we will make sure it does not outlive the next decade of Spanish progress."
SPR_the_chemist_calls_out_towards_the_farmer:0 "Explosive Crop Growth With UEE"
SPR_the_chemist_calls_out_towards_the_farmer_desc:0 "The Unión Española de Explosivos or UEE was once the legal monopoly company for explosive production in Spain, a status which allowed it to become one of the biggest companies in the country. It focused on explosive production such as bombs, chemicals, magazines, etc. Yet it eventually also diversified into making fertilizers, as they had much overlap with their field of expertise. Should we give them the funding for it, we could heavily boost fertilizer production for our fields while at the same time giving a boost to our explosive sector and produce more jobs for the region of Bilbao."
SPR_the_richest_soil_in_europe:0 "The Most Diverse Soil in Europe"
SPR_the_richest_soil_in_europe_desc:0 "While Spanish soil may not be the richest or productive in Europe, being leagues behind Ukrainian soil or German and Communard agricultural production, it is one of if not the most diverse soil in terms of crop variety. From orchard crops such as fruits, to wheat, to nuts, to vegetables, to vineyards, to legumes, sugar beets, tobacco, olives and so many others, Spain seems to have it all. While we’d be fools to try to compete with certain products such as Ukrainian weed or Mittelafrikan exports, we can leverage our agricultural diversity to create a niche for our products and thus generate more revenue."
SPR_Second_Phase_of_Reform:0 "The Next Phase of the Reform"
SPR_Second_Phase_of_Reform_desc:0 "The first phase was mostly a look into what must be done, and how the worst of the crisis can be weathered. Now, however, the time has come to fully fix the issues, thanks to the stabilizing political situation in Spain and the newfound political support to finally push the, often controversial, reforms through. Hopefully the matter can finally be set to rest, and Spain’s rural regions finally reformed to a state where they are no longer nesting grounds for social unrest and radicalism."
SPR_Agrarianism_Powered_by_Foreign_Engines:0 "Foreign Engines for Domestic Needs"
SPR_Agrarianism_Powered_by_Foreign_Engines_desc:0 "The sad truth is that Spain, as it currently stands, simply cannot sustain the needed demand for tractors, trucks and other vehicles at the scope which our reforms demand. Not only are the production lines unfit for the demands, the designs our factories and forges have created are simply inferior to those produced by the international sellers. As such, the government must sign contracts with anyone willing to produce the machines of agriculture to us, costly as it may be, or otherwise we are forced to slow down the reforms once more."
SPR_Domestic_Designs_Till_Our_Fields:0 "Hispanic Engines for Hispanic Fields"
SPR_Domestic_Designs_Till_Our_Fields_desc:0 "If we are to truly modernize our agriculture and improve the yield of our crops, steps must be taken to utilize machinery in the fields more. Spain is not particularly known for its heavy industry, but even our backwards industry has produced some tractors in the past, such as the chassis that would later get used for the creation of the Trubia tanks. We should invest into local heavy industry, such as Hispano-Suiza, to mobilize Spain’s resources fully in support of the agricultural reform. Only with domestic engines can we ensure full self-reliance, even if it takes a while to get to the level of other European nations."
SPR_Final_Land_Requisition:0 "Final Land Requisition"
SPR_Final_Land_Requisition_desc:0 "So far, our government has been hesitant to nationalize and redistribute land given how powerful local landlords tend to be in Spain, but without significant intervention and seizure of land, the agrarian reform will be left unfinished for all time. Spain’s rural areas cannot thrive if the land is spread out unevenly between its denizens. As such, while it will be a difficult decision politically, and bound to cause ire among the powerful landowner elites, it must be done to finally fix Spain’s grievous issues."
SPR_Local_Conditions_Above_All:0 "Localist Agricultural Planning"
SPR_Local_Conditions_Above_All_desc:0 "Spain’s agricultural prospects are far from homogenous, and the yield of our fields is based on numerous highly local factors. These factors range from the local terrain, given Spain’s highly uneven and varied topography, to the available crops, preferred sizes of estates and available workforce. In some areas of Northern Spain, small farms known as minifundios are simply too unproductive to be worth much, while in Southern Spain, vast estates known as latifundios cause much grief to Spain’s peasants as they own no land of their own and are subject to the whims of the landowners, in addition to quite terrible pay. To alleviate the issue, we must set up programs to promote local means of approaching agricultural reform, from choosing different production methods to providing land to the southern peasants."
SPR_Work_for_Jornaleros:0 "Full-Time Work for Jornaleros"
SPR_Work_for_Jornaleros_desc:0 "Jornaleros are seasonal workers, who often have even worse working conditions than the renters of larger latifundios, and suffer from being stagnated on the societal ladder, unable to break the chain of poverty given their meagre wages, no work security, no pensions and very limited access to jobs outside of the exploitative labour terms provided by landowners. In times of economic crisis, jornaleros are the ones to bear the toughest burden, sometimes resorting to eating grass or tree roots for survival. This cannot continue, the government must open work programs and contracts for jornaleros to escape their abject poverty. This will also push latifundio lords into updating their work terms, since they will have competition for their workforce."

SPR_university:0 "Rebirth of the Spanish March Towards Progress"
SPR_university_desc:0 "For the better part of the past few centuries, Spain has been punching well below its weight as a nation. Even as we held an empire in which the sun never set, from the Filipinas to Lima, and from Tierra del Fuego to Nutka, the Spanish mainland fell far behind its European peers. With the situation finally looking under control, it is time to restart the Spanish march towards progress. It will not be an easy road, but nevertheless, we are convinced it is something we can do, and most importantly, something we must do for the sake of the future of the nation."
SPR_the_four_horsemen:0 "The Four Horsemen"
SPR_the_four_horsemen_desc:0 "The four horsemen of the apocalypse, as common understanding of biblical scripture goes, are Death, Conquest, Famine, and War. Yet today, Spain faces four very different horsemen it must defeat: Air, Land, Sea and Scientific progress. These are all the obstacles we are certain to face in the inevitably global struggle that will ensue. If we are to make it past the rapture, we must plunge forward into the darkness and bring Spain to the light."

SPR_united_minds_desc:0 "A scientific climate in which our top scientists and researchers have no way to interact and collaborate with each other if they aren’t going out of their way to travel halfway across the country is simply unacceptable. It is high time we establish the Consejo Intelectual Nacional, a council that will allow our best scientists across many fields to finally collaborate in a centralized environment and be able to pool up their resources so we can truly start getting things done. It won’t be immediate, but we have reached out to as many people as we can, and we have offered them generous funding for whatever projects they may have in mind."

SPR_science_of_the_high_seas_desc:0 "The Spanish Navy is, without a measure of a doubt, the most competent branch of the Spanish armed forces. Not only that, in recent times it has also seen many dispersed but still important centers of military production and facilities that provide many jobs to the regions they reside in. That is why we’d be foolish not to capitalize on the success of the Navy by granting the Naval Academy in Cádiz more funding to be put towards research and development projects, so we may finally be able to fully modernize and grow the navy to even past its pre-1898 splendor. "

SPR_the_center_of_military_progress_desc:0 "For as much as the army may have caused headaches for us in the past as a nation, whether it be via coups or its resounding defeats, we are not foolish enough to not recognize the fact that a modern nation state simply cannot function without an army. It is high time we pay more attention to the Academia General Militar in Zaragoza, so our youngest and brightest officers are able to unleash their brand new ideas in cutting edge facilities and without any budget constraints as we move towards a modern and capable fighting force. As such, its facilities will be greatly expanded, and any other necessary overhauls will be swiftly done."
SPR_to_conquer_the_heavens:0 "To Conquer the Heavens"
SPR_to_conquer_the_heavens_desc:0 "The Spanish Air Force has definitely been the most neglected one out of all our armed forces, boasting very few and highly outdated planes. As recent conflicts have increasingly shown the need for air power, and the fact that global supply for new and improved aircraft are uncertain, we must establish domestic air production with domestic designs so we are not forced to rely on anyone else once the inevitable global conflict happens. The Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial or INTA shall be formed, and it will be tasked with overseeing and fostering new aeronautical developments so the Spanish skies will be completely protected, and potentially even allow for civilian aeronautic developments once the worst is past."

SPR_to_split_an_atom_desc:0 "In the scientific community, recent advancements have proven that the atom, the most fundamental part of the universe to our current understanding of it, can be split apart, and in that process release unprecedented amounts of energy. While we don’t know much yet about that process, we know that we could one day harness the energy of the atom to make a weapon so destructive it could only be compared to biblical accounts of the rapture. It is time to assemble a team of scientists to work on it, as well as geological explorations of Spanish soil for any uranium deposits."
SPR_radio_focus:0 "Radio Nacional Conquers the Radio Waves"
SPR_radio_focus_desc:0 "One of the most groundbreaking inventions of the past few decades was that of the radio. While initially limited to those wealthy few who could afford the novelty which served as little more than an expensive paperweight in most cases, the technology has finally reached the point where radio devices are widespread amongst the common people and radio stations abound. Thus, we should establish our own national radio station, Radio Nacional de España, to better be able to reach the Spanish populace and spread our message far and wide."
SPR_the_bleeding_edge:0 "Bleeding Edge From Madrid’s University City"
SPR_the_bleeding_edge_desc:0 "While Madrid has always had a buzzling academic and intelligentsia scene, its university infrastructure leaves a lot to be desired. This was meant to be solved by the construction of a University City in Madrid that finally centralizes academic infrastructure into a singular space. Nevertheless, the general situation in Spain means that construction has faced many delays. However, as it is finally finished and has opened its doors to the public, we can finally have a centralized place for the brightest minds of Spain to meet and discuss amongst themselves in."
SPR_mechanical_calculations:0 "The Possibilities of Telekino"
SPR_mechanical_calculations_desc:0 "Leonardo Torres Quevedo’s most curious invention may be that of the “Telekino”. This is a device he came up with after thinking of the dangers of airships, a particular interest among his many fields of expertise. He came to the conclusion that something as perfidious as the hydrogen-filled airship would be best left for the machines to maintain. Thus, he developed a machine that could receive electromagnetic waves from a transmitter, and he later showcased his invention through a chess player and a telekino which controlled a tricycle at first, and after sufficient testing, was scaled-up to guide a boat remotely. While it has so far been not much more than just a novelty, perhaps with a blank check and the exploration of its applications, we could be looking at the future of warfare and technology"
SPR_spanish_computation_machines:0 "Quevedo’s Thinking Machines"
SPR_spanish_computation_machines_desc:0 "After having worked on the Telekino, Torres Quevedo applied his experiences with computing machines to creating one of the first attempt at a computer. The machine, known as Electromechanical arithmometer, an electromechanical calculator that worked from inputs into a typewriter, was faster and able to work on more complex equations than its predecessors. If we could unleash the potential of his machine, we could perhaps have a machine that is able to calculate hundreds or thousands of complex equations at once, and thus potentially set off a scientific revolution with 'computing' power, which could have applications we can’t even dream of right now."
SPR_electronics_focus:0 "International Science Through JAE"
SPR_electronics_focus_desc:0 "The Junta para Ampliación de Estudios e Investigaciones Científicas or JAE is an institution that follows and expands upon the academic framework set up by the ILE. It is a body that aims to boost scientific and cultural development in Spain through the opening of centers for learning and laboratories, as well as student and teacher exchanges with the rest of the world. We could leverage these exchanges to not only further development here in Spain, but also our standing among the international scientific community while fostering good relations with the nations we partake in exchanges with."

SPR_experimental_education_desc:0 "The Instituto Libre de Enseñanza or ILE was a response to prime minister Cánovas’ decree banning academic freedom if it wasn’t compatible with catholic teaching in 1875. Ever since then, the ILE has been one of the leading centers for education in Spain, and has seen many of its brightest minds pass through its doors as students, teachers or contributors, such as the Generation of ‘98 and the Generation of ‘27. While despised by conservatives, it is loved by republicans and liberals due to its teaching method based on Krausism, which advocates for doctrinal and academic freedom in teaching. As much as it may displease some, we have much to gain from such a system."
SPR_education_from_the_rural_areas_to_the_capital:0 "Final War on Illiteracy"
SPR_education_from_the_rural_areas_to_the_capital_desc:0 "One of Spain’s biggest societal weaknesses in its recent history has been the lack of a sound and effective education system, which has seen it lag far behind its European peers and even some previously thought 'underdeveloped' nations such as Japan. This, for ideological and practical reasons, cannot stand any longer. Progress in this field will take a generation to fully manifest, but we must declare a war on illiteracy right away to truly set Spain on a course to eradicate it. We will set up more schools across the countryside, centers of higher learning, provide more scholarships, educational and scientific grants, and also set up programs for adults to educate themselves in, whether it be basic education or technical and vocational schools. Soon enough, the Spanish populace will be an educated populace, able to write the most eloquent poetry or make world renowned scientific breakthroughs. "
SPR_ad_astra_per_aspera:0 "Patriotic Education Through Sound Cinema"
SPR_ad_astra_per_aspera_desc:0 "If there is anything outside of warfare we can learn from the French, the Germans and the Americans, it’s that cinema is not only a cultural phenomenon, it is also a powerful tool for propaganda and educational purposes. By fostering a strong domestic cinematographic industry, and perhaps giving some directors a few script “ideas” that align with our interests, we can use the tool of cinema to not only entertain the masses, but to shape Spain in a new image which is more amenable to us"

SPR_unleash_the_new_minds_of_spain_desc:0 "After so long, our efforts are finally bearing fruit. We are still not up to par with the leading powers of the world, but if nothing else, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Not only have our reforms and investments have shown that there is indeed Spanish talent hidden across the realm, but they have also allowed us to have the infrastructure and resources necessary to nurture them and bring Spain forward into modernity. Spain’s best and brightest are no longer stuck in a minifundio of a rural backwater, they are going to top class universities, laboratories and military installations to make truly Spanish inventions. We have brought Spain into the light of modernity."

sprd.3.t:0 "[GetYear] Conferencia Nacional de Intelectuales de España"
sprd.3.desc:0 "The Spanish military is hardly the most innovative force in the world, and despite being a pioneer in some fields, such as amphibious landings, electric submarines and improvised anti-tank weapons, the nation can hardly hold much faith in its armed forces if their technology is decades older than the rivals across the border. As such, the nation’s best scientists and experts on military technology have been called to a meeting, the first Conferencia Nacional de Intelectuales de España, where civil and military engineers from all across Spain have gathered to discuss the direction of Spain’s military procurement and research efforts. Representing civil engineering is the outstanding Spanish railway and automotive pioneer Ángel Cirilo Chueca Sainz, who has promoted the motorisation of Spain for nearly three decades now. The Spanish air industry is represented by Federico Cantero and Juan de la Cierva, both experts in the field of autogyros and helicopters, as well as Jorge Loring Martínez, a prominent aircraft designer in Spain.\n\nThe Spanish air force is also represented by the head of the force, Alfredo Kindelán. The Spanish navy is represented by the admiral and current head of naval developments, Wenceslao Benítez Inglott, who has in the past helped foster such innovation as the use of first Spanish seaplane carrier and the use of autogyros from the platform. The Spanish army is represented by engineers Manuel Arias-Paz and Ruiz de Toledo, with exceeding experience in the field of military vehicles and armour. Finally, in a relatively new field, José María Otero de Navascués represents the very secretive but highly exciting Spanish foray into the area of nuclear weaponry. The council commenced discussions yesterday, highlighting the deficiencies of all branches of the Spanish military and civil industry, with Cirilo lamenting the terrible state of Spain’s railroads and the near total lack of trucks and other civilian vehicles needed to boost the domestic industry.\n\nRepresentatives of the air force and civil aviation in turn complained that Spain does not possess adequate facilities or resource extraction chains for the production of newer and more complex aircraft, and has to rely on license of foreign designs. The navy, while less critically outdated than the rest of the military branches, did note that new developments in submarines and naval technologies such as radar and electronic communications had left the Spanish armada in the dust. Finally, the representatives of the army viewed the lack of tanks, modern artillery and even suitable firearms as a grave deficiency within the Spanish military. The council debated and negotiated the direction of Spanish military and civil spending for quite some time, but finally, an agreement between the different parties was found and the spending proposal drafted to the government of Spain, which determined that..."

## Army Tree ##

SPR_rebuild_command:0 "Rebuild Our National Command"
SPR_rebuild_command_desc:0 "After the military was given free reign over our nation, they expanded the army budget considerably but all those coins flowed straight into the pockets of corrupt officers. Much work is needed for the nation to stand proudly on its two feet again, and the military reform is no exception to this."
SPR_guard_border:0 "Guard the Borders"
SPR_guard_border_desc:0 "The many paths over the Pyrenees are our only weakness. We must fortify the border, to ensure no-one pushes into Spanish territory while we can yet defend it."
SPR_standing_army:0 "Boots On the Ground"
SPR_standing_army_desc:0 "From time immemorial, the wars have been fought by boots on the ground, the noble infantryman in his many, many forms. While modern war may have evolved to be even more lethal and varied, the infantryman is still the backbone of every military worldwide, and as Spain lacks the funds to buy massive amounts of tanks or planes, we must focus on the soldiers as much as we can"
SPR_mobile_army:0 "The Thrill of Maneuvre Warfare"
SPR_mobile_army_desc:0 "While the infantry will obviously remain a priority of our forces, a mobile force is needed to counteract the developments of our enemies. These mobile forces can also be used to suppress rebellions in Africa and the metropole, and can provide a stepping stone for future motorization and mechanization developments, depending on the route we take."
SPR_new_equipment:0 "The Harsh Reality of Materialist Warfare"
SPR_new_equipment_desc:0 "The wars of today are fought in a manner completely different than those our men are used to. Materialistic supremacy, be it in equipment, ammunition or other goods, is needed to defeat our enemies, especially should the conflict bog down like the Weltkrieg did."
SPR_cavalry_focus:0 "Glory of the Cavalry Corps"
SPR_cavalry_focus_desc:0 "The ways of cavalry seemed to be lost when the horrors of Weltkrieg were unleashed on the world, with barbed fire, machine guns and heavy artillery making much of the horseback cavalry completely obsolete. Yet in the harsh terrain of Iberia, horses may very well retain a niche, especially if we were to integrate other units into the cavalry to make the utilization it more suited for a modern war."
SPR_artillery_focus:0 "The Indomitable Human Spirit"
SPR_artillery_focus_desc:0 "Materialistic superiority is all well and good until the men under one’s command abandon their posts and run away or surrender to the enemy. Without harsh and strict discipline, mass utilization of propaganda and focus on the superiority of Spanish spirit above all else, we cannot make sure that our men are suited for the horrors of war. The more traditional officers of the Spanish army support the direction of focusing on mental warfare, and the drilling of our men until their will can shatter that of their enemies."
SPR_fortress_busters:0 "A Hammer to Shatter Any Bunker"
SPR_fortress_busters_desc:0 "Modern warfare is developing into multiple interesting directions, but it would seem that fortifications shall still play a strong role in the ways of war in the future as well. By investing into heavy artillery and modern shell types aimed at defeating the various architectural and engineering developments used in fortification building, we can ensure that our men are never bogged down by enemy bunkers or pillboxes."
SPR_composite_divisions:0 "Composite Divisions"
SPR_composite_divisions_desc:0 "The Republican officers, in their ill-fated reforms, came up with an interesting concept, that of the Composite Divisions. Utilizing far more mobile artillery than the conventional infantry units of our rivals, these divisions would require more supplies to function and a more sophisticated supply infrastructure, but in turn their overwhelming firepower would allow our men to surpass even the hardest targets and most dug-in foes."
SPR_the_queen_on_our_board:0 "The Queen of Our Board"
SPR_the_queen_on_our_board_desc:0 "Infantry must become the jack-of-all-trades in Spanish army, moving quickly from front to front, suppressing enemy through integrated artillery forces all the while retaining its impressive ability to dig in and resist enemy attacks or counter-attacks. As such, we must train our men and officers to make sure that our infantry divisions are the Queen of the chess set, always outmaneuvering their opponents through sheer versatility."
SPR_fire_superiority:0 "Drowning Our Enemies in Shells"
SPR_fire_superiority_desc:0 "Spain’s artillery force has always been rather outdated, but we have recently acquired a large amount of German FK.16 field guns and Austro-Hungarian M.14 Feldhaubitzes to strengthen our fleet of old French and British cannons. With these new additions, we must set up a domestic ammunition factory to supply the needed shells for these new guns, and with their assistance, we can drown any enemy position with endless rounds."
SPR_the_traditional_arm:0 "Never Another Annual!"
SPR_the_traditional_arm_desc:0 "The defeat at Annual at the hands of the Rifian tribesmen led by Abd el-Krim was by far the worst defeat our nation has suffered in the 20th century. But by investing into colonial guards and upgrading the training practices and equipment of the Spanish Tercio, or foreign Legion, we can ensure that the Rifians, or any other African enemies, will never threaten our colonial possessions ever again."
SPR_cyclists_and_sappers:0 "Broaden the Definition of Cavalry"
SPR_cyclists_and_sappers_desc:0 "Cavalry as it was understood in the last century is very much obsolete by now, but the broad concept of cavalry still serves a purpose. On the one hand, units like Guardia Civil and Carabineros must still utilize horses in the underdeveloped regions of Spain, while on the other regular army cavalry units are still valuable as scouts, anti-partisan forces and colonial guards. But we can expand the definition of cavalry by integrating various sapper and cyclist units into their organization, providing much needed versatility and firepower to the cavalry units. This can further be strengthened with the inclusion of small but powerful portable guns like the Canon d'Infanterie de 37 modèle 1916 TRP, which is very easy to maneuver into position, and while quite obsolete in normal duties, can be utilized better thanks to the mobility of the cavalry units."
SPR_heavy_cavalry:0 "Heavy Cavalry of the Modern Era"
SPR_heavy_cavalry_desc:0 "When cavalry developments were theorized by Spain’s cavalry officer corps, the idea of a heavy cavalry has resurfaced. While the lancers, cuirassiers and cataracts are obviously things of the past, the German experience in the Weltkrieg proved that there was still a need for a mobile, hard-hitting unit such as the Sturmtruppen. However, Spanish officers have argued that this niche could be filled by the cavalry, with horse-mounted stormtroopers dismounting to attack fixed positions similar to their German infantry counterparts, but retaining the ability to fight from a horseback if the tactical situation requires it. While this type of unit must still be experimented upon, it might provide a new breath of life for the cavalry units."
SPR_motorization:0 "New Steeds For a New Age"
SPR_motorization_desc:0 "The Spanish army is woefully under-motorized, to the point that regional police forces often have better degree of motorization than our regulars. This must be rectified immediately, with the Spanish truck manufacturer Hispano-Suiza contracted to build more trucks for the army in order to better move our forces on the battlefield."
SPR_flesh_over_machine:0 "Knights of Castile"
SPR_flesh_over_machine_desc:0 "While the tanks and armoured cars of today are quite fearsome weapons, they are no match to a properly motivated, equipped and trained Knights of Castile, who through sheer mastery of their craft can utilize the various tools in their arsenal to outmaneuvre and outpace their machine-powered adversaries in the rough and difficult terrain of Iberia."
SPR_maneuvre_warfare:0 "Speed Over Stagnation"
SPR_maneuvre_warfare_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg turned into a massive meat grinder especially on the Western Front primarily because both sides lacked the speed and maneuverability required to fight a war in the age of machines and automatic weapons. We cannot make that mistake, and thus must focus all our attention into ensuring that Spanish troops are fast and nimble enough that they cannot be pulled into the war of attrition we witnessed in the Weltkrieg."
SPR_morale_above_all:0 "War is But a Battle of Wills"
SPR_morale_above_all_desc:0 "Modern ‘experts’ may claim that a triumph in warfare is simply a matter of overpowering your opponent through materialistic means, either through the quantity of one’s supplies or the quality of one’s weapons. This is false. War is a battle of wills, where those imbued with true spirit for victory triumph over those who are poorly motivated and trained. As such, we must ensure that the Spanish soldier is ready for war and has the psychological means to best his opponents in this tug-of-war of mental fortitude."
SPR_local_terrain_local_means:0 "Warfare Tailored to Spanish Conditions"
SPR_local_terrain_local_means_desc:0 "Spanish terrain is quite unique, with the large topographical variation, multiple rivers, different amounts of vegetation present in our regions and the lack of good roads in multiple regions. As such, the commanders of Spain’s soldiers must be taught how to overcome these difficult conditions to such a degree that they can utilize these peculiarities to ambush, trap and pin down our enemies as they are still adapting to the conditions of Iberia."
SPR_the_desire_for_victory:0 "By Our Will Alone!"
SPR_the_desire_for_victory_desc:0 "Our army must be whipped into shape after so many years of decline, and while disciplining alone would probably yield results, increases in soldier salary as well as the mass utilization of patriotic and militaristic propaganda is likely to boost the results even further. Even the mostly lowly grunt of Spain must realize that only through his willingness to sacrifice everything for Eternal Spain can we defeat our enemies on the battlefields of tomorrow."
SPR_military_autarky:0 "By Our Means Alone!"
SPR_military_autarky_desc:0 "We cannot rely on our neighbours to supply us with the latest equipment or the best blueprints for future weapons, but instead we must adopt a degree of military autarky, utilizing only Spanish companies and factories to produce the means for warfare. After all, in the world of today, everything is ever shifting, and relying on a foreign supplier so close to another major war would simply be a fool’s errand ."
SPR_montojas_heavy_cavalry:0 "The Lancers Without Horses"
SPR_montojas_heavy_cavalry_desc:0 "The use of a horse for cavalry attacks is long dead, killed by modern machines and fortification techniques. But just as it died, a new force appeared at its stead, the tank. With the correct application of armoured spearheads, we can encircle our enemies, smash apart their defences or utilize gaps in their lines to wreak havoc on their supply lines, just like the heavy cavalry of the past."
SPR_lluchs_motorized_infantry:0 "Soldiers of Speed"
SPR_lluchs_motorized_infantry_desc:0 "Vicente Rojo Lluch, one of the most talented officers in our force, and a keen reader of the British exile tank commander J.F.C Fuller’s theories, has proposed that we create a fully motorized infantry force, capable of keeping up with our tanks and providing longevity in fights that the tanks themselves could not provide."
SPR_upgrade_the_trubias:0 "Rekindling the Trubia Project"
SPR_upgrade_the_trubias_desc:0 "During the Rif war, the weakness of our tank forces was more than evident. Our vehicles were old, slow and unreliable, and the terrain of the Rif was wholly unsuited for them. To rectify this flaw, the artillery captain Carlos Ruiz de Toledo, one of the few men in Spain to have experienced tank combat, set out to create the first domestic tank in Spain, the Trubia A4. While the program has vexed and vaned in funding and interest, and has been on hold for quite some time with only a few vehicles built, if we were to give it the funding and attention it deserves, the Trubias could become a new mainstay of Spain’s army."
SPR_weapons_of_opportunity:0 "Weapons of Opportunity"
SPR_weapons_of_opportunity_desc:0 "Tanks have inherited the role of cavalry as a weapon of mobility, but this is especially the case for us. We do not have the massive weapon forges of the Ruhr river to create metallic behemoths with, but we can utilize our industrial basis to create light tanks that can be used as a weapon of opportunity to destroy our enemy through maneuvre and flanking, not unstoppable armoured onslaught from the front of enemy bunkers as the Germans can. Our tanks shall be weapons of opportunity, utilized to exploit enemy mistakes to the fullest extent."

SPR_air_factory:0 "Iberavia Aircraft Factory"
SPR_air_factory_desc:0 "Before the start of the war, there were plans for opening a new aircraft industry near Madrid, but the bad economic situation and the war prevented any investments. Now that we have achieved our glorious victory, we finally have the opportunity to finance and support it."
SPR_expanded_cooperation:0 "Symbiosis of Air Support and Ground Troops"
SPR_expanded_cooperation_desc:0 "Modern battlefields are increasingly more dynamic and victory is no longer solely in the hands of one branch of the military. By increasing communications and cooperation between the various branches of the army and air force, we can ensure that Spain isn’t left behind on modern combined arms warfare. Close air support is critically important to infantry, while new scout planes can help both naval and ground-based artillery hit their targets with unprecedented accuracy. Similarly, fighter cover will allow our men to advance unmolested by enemy attack aircraft"
SPR_air_focus:0 "Uncontested Rulers of Iberia's Skies"
SPR_air_focus_desc:0 "While our aircraft production speeds up, we must prepare our pilots and ground staff for this expansion, so that when the time comes and our air fleet can contest those of our enemies, they are fully prepared and trained for the dangers of air combat. Much more funding must be directed at new designs and innovations so that we can defeat our foes more efficiently, though Spain’s limited air industry will make this a long process unfortunately.."
SPR_cierva_autogyros:0 "Cierva's Vertical Wonders"
SPR_cierva_autogyros_desc:0 "Juan de la Cierva is one of Spain’s best known aviators, and his Cierva Autogiro Company is known world-wide for piloting the creation of autogiros, unpowered aerial vehicles with the ability to fly without the use of wings, using rotors instead. Autogiros can be useful for a variety of tasks, but for scouting targets, both in military and naval setting, they can be absolutely revolutionary. Cierva is also planning to work on similar designs utilizing engines, which hopefully could be even more versatile in serving our military."
SPR_utilize_local_talents:0 "Celebrating Spain's Homegrown Aviators"
SPR_utilize_local_talents_desc:0 "While Spain is by no means the leading nation of aviation developments, there are quite a bit of local aviation enthusiasm, and even some famous aviators, such as the long-distance champion Ramon Franco and his flying boat Plus Ultra, the Rifian fighter pilot and Count of Jarama, Joaquin Garcia, as well as the Barcelonan female pilot prodigy, Maria Josep Colomer i Luque. If we can utilize these figures to boost interest in aviation, it is bound to increase our recruitment rates and the starting experience of said recruits as well."
SPR_fokker_cooperation:0 "Contacts With Fokker"
SPR_fokker_cooperation_desc:0 "Fokker is one of the most famous aerial innovators due to being the creator of iconic Weltkrieg-era planes such as Fokker E.1 monoplane and the infamous Fokker Dr.1, preferred fighter of the legendary Red Baron. However, after the war, Fokker returned to his native Netherlands and opened up a factory there, which has utilized Netherlands’ neutrality to supply nations not aligned with the Internationale, Entente or Reichspakt. Possibly the most common of their new products is the Fokker D.XXI, a fighter known to use many innovative design features already adopted by numerous European nations such as Finland and Netherlands itself. We have previously worked with Fokker on many projects, so it would be only natural to contact them once more as we focus on new airframes."
SPR_german_cooperation:0 "Soaring With the Eagle"
SPR_german_cooperation_desc:0 "The tales of German and British aerial dogfights from the Weltkrieg are mythical in nature, but German experience with air combat is no myth indeed. Their experts have used the knowledge paid for in blood during the Weltkrieg to push the limits of aircraft technology to the extreme, and thus it would be very beneficial to us if we were to deepen ties to German aircraft manufacturers. After all, giants like Heinkel, Dornier and Zeppelin hardly need all their production for domestic use, and thus we could utilize their models to bolster our growing air force."
SPR_hispano_suiza_cooperation:0 "Hispano-Suiza Kickstarts Spain's Domestic Aviation"
SPR_hispano_suiza_cooperation_desc:0 "Despite our meager contributions to global aviation craze, Spain is not devoid of aircraft developers. Most prominent of these is Hispano-Suiza, a manufacturer of weapons and vehicles of all kinds, and recently they have expanded into making aircrafts, such as the Hispano-Suiza HS.34, a biplane trainer/reconnaissance aircraft. We should invest more into our domestic aviation instead of buying costly models from overseas, both to invest in local business and also to create jobs for Spanish experts and workers."
SPR_Hispano_Aviacion:0 "Founding of Hispano Aviación"
SPR_Hispano_Aviacion_desc:0 "Thanks to the ample funding given to them by the government, Hispano-Suiza has started exploring the prospects of opening a domestic aircraft factory. They’ve asked us for funding to kickstart a daughter company, Hispano Aviación, which would oversee aircraft construction, design, testing and marketing while Hispano-Suiza itself focuses on its more traditional sources of production and revenue. The government is, despite the economic troubles Spain has faced, ready to fund such a cause, in the hopes that it aids in the creation of a truly domestic air force."
SPR_CASA_lisences:0 "CASA Brings German Machines to Spanish Factories"
SPR_CASA_lisences_desc:0 "CASA is a minor aircraft firm specializing in two-engined designs, but their experience with larger aircrafts could be translated into the creation of bomber aircraft relatively easily. CASA representatives have however posited that they would prefer to license German designs from the start, as they don’t have massive experience with military models, while the German bombers are renowned for their sturdy construction and good payloads."
SPR_air_cruisers_over_spain:0 "Air Cruisers Hunt Over Spain"
SPR_air_cruisers_over_spain_desc:0 "The Dutch concept of Air Cruiser is best embodied by the Fokker G.1, a heavy fighter that blew European air experts away with its unrivaled performance upon its first showings. A swift and surprisingly nimble aircraft for its size, Fokker representatives claim that it could be the perfect interceptor for Spain’s needs given the superior size of our most likely enemy, the Communards."
SPR_multirole_bombers:0 "A Bomber to Fit All Niches"
SPR_multirole_bombers_desc:0 "The Dutch have approached the creation of bombers very differently to other European nations. The Dutch concept of a multirole bomber is best seen in the Fokker T.V bomber, which can remain airborne for very long time and loiter around the air space until its qualities are required. Capable of light interception due to its nose-mounted 20 millimetre Oerlikon cannon, it could help ease the burden on our fighters, but simultaneously its decent bombload means that it can fill the role of a tactical bomber if need be. Having such versatile aircraft for use would mean that we require less of them, which is always great news for the strained budget of Spain."
SPR_learning_from_the_best:0 "Following in the Baron's Slipstream"
SPR_learning_from_the_best_desc:0 "While Spain has its share of excellent pilots, it would do us good to learn from the German elite pilots, many of whom served in Weltkrieg or more recently, in the expedition to Afghanistan. As such, small number of Spain’s best pilots shall be sent to Germany to learn from the masters of the sky, so that ours can be fully protected by aces when the time for war comes."
SPR_lerets_patent:0 "Virgilio Leret's Curious Patent"
SPR_lerets_patent_desc:0 "Virgilio Leret is a relatively unknown figure in Spain, but he recently applied for a patent that has sent Spanish aviation circles into a frenzy. In the patent, he details the inner workings of a jet engine, a completely new style of propulsion with possibly even more power than those of radial or inline combustion engines. Similar developments have appeared all over Europe and United States, but Leret being Spanish makes this design very much worth investigating further."

SPR_naval_academy_desc:0 "The Spanish navy is perhaps the most advanced branch of our military, boasting many innovative designs such as the Dedalo seaplane carrier, multiple submarines and even the battleships Jaime and Alfonso XIII. However, even this seemingly glorious force has been languishing under the weight of budgetary restrictions, lack of credible need for a navy and the sorely needed expansion to our naval yards and docks. If Spain is to return to the world stage as a champion of the seas, there is much work to be done until the legacy of the glorious armada is restored."

SPR_expand_navy:0 "Second Coming of Flota del Tesoro"
SPR_expand_navy_desc:0 "The Spanish treasure fleets were the staple of maritime trade from the 1500s to the decline of the empire in the 1700s, and their reach span across the entire globe, transporting everything from luxury goods like cocoa, spices and silk to resources and plunder from the New World. In the current day, the merchant marine of Spain is in a far less glorious state, but there is hope still. By expanding support for companies such as Compañía Transatlántica Española and Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas, we may be able to better project our trade influence throughout our old empire, and kickstart the vaunted trade of luxuries and resources once more, though much work must be done if we wish to rival the transport empires of the Germans and Anglos, of course."
SPR_navy_focus:0 "Restoring the España Class to Glory"
SPR_navy_focus_desc:0 "The España class of battleships was built between 1909 and 1923, consisting of three ships, Alfonso XIII, Jaime and the titular España, which sadly was sunk during the Rif war due to storm damage. These ships, while still the most powerful in the Spanish fleet, are relics of the past, utilizing a somewhat obsolete dreadnought design partly created under British influence. However, only a fool would suggest going with a new design when the battleships are still completely operable, and thus the navy’s development branch, Junta Técnica de la Armada, has instead decided to implement a grand renovation plan for the ships. The ships would receive a new secondary complement, an upgraded torpedo protection bulge and the restructuring of the old secondary gun placements into crew compartments, as well as the upgrading of the anti-air complement and fire control systems to be on par with modern European designs."
SPR_reinosa_guns:0 "La Naval's Grand Cannons"
SPR_reinosa_guns_desc:0 "The Cantabrian town of Reinosa houses the vaunted halls of La Naval, the main artillery plant in all of Spain, capable of creating the thunderers needed for our fleet. We must ensure that the factories of Reinosa get all the funds they need to produce more modern and efficient designs, so that the cruisers, battleships and destroyers of Spain do not have to find themselves outgunned at times of war."
SPR_balearics_plan:0 "The Prickly Citadel of the Balearics"
SPR_balearics_plan_desc:0 "The Balearics hold a rather central position in the Mediterranean, with the port of Palma as a base the Spanish navy can control the Pillars of Hercules and the entire basin of the Mare Nostrum. However, should an opposing force attempt a strike on Balearics, we are less well-defended on the islands itself, and they lack a proper anti-ship defense scheme. As such, it has been suggested by coastal artillery forces of the army and the coastal defense fleets of the navy that the Balearics should receive a complement of anti-ship artillery pieces and emplacements so that we can keep our naval supremacy on Spanish waters."
SPR_ferrol_scheme:0 "Reconsidering the Ferrol Scheme"
SPR_ferrol_scheme_desc:0 "The Ferrol naval base in Galicia is a rather curious affair, as it houses the remnants of a near-dead empire still. The British experts and delegates from the Vickers company had arrived to Spain to help set up our fledgling navy back in the early 1900s, and with their help, Ferrol became one of the key naval hubs in all of Spain. The British designers helped create new cruiser and destroyer classes. However, with the collapse of the British empire, this scheme was continued for the time being, yet as the alliances of the world grow shiftier, the time has come to review whether the Britons truly belong to Ferrol or not."
SPR_dedalo_experience:0 "Legacy of Autogyro Carrier Dédalo"
SPR_dedalo_experience_desc:0 "The seaplane carrier Dédalo has certainly seen better days, and is currently in limbo waiting for either upgrades or scrapping, but it serves yet as a reminder of Spain’s naval aviation. From the decks of Dédalo, the first seaplanes, and curiously enough, autogyros of the Cierva company, took to the air, helping Spain develop new usage strategies for these technologies. While the ship itself may no longer be the glorious warsteed it once was, its legacy as the pioneer of Spanish seaborne bombers and recon aircraft will continue to pay dividends for decades to come."
SPR_memories_of_alhucemas:0 "The Glorious Memory of Alhucemas"
SPR_memories_of_alhucemas_desc:0 "The Alhucemas landing was a joint Franco-Spanish military operation carried out during the Rif war, which saw thousands of Spanish troops, dozens of aircraft and naval ships and even a smattering of tanks invade the shores of Alhucemas, striking the rear of Abd el Krim’s defenses and breaking the Riffian morale until the eventual defeat. It demonstrated that even a force of relatively inexperienced nature, such as the Spanish army was at the time, could mount a highly effective and large-scale amphibious assault, and it remains an important teaching point in many naval academies today. We must honour the legacy of Alhucemas and hone our skills in maritime assaults even further, as the future war is likely to require such skills just as much as the Rif war did."
SPR_resume_alava_class:0 "Salvage of the Alava Project"
SPR_resume_alava_class_desc:0 "The Alava project was a scheme to produce new destroyers for the Spanish navy under the Alava class designation, but as the project had been set underway in 1935, the crisis of Black Monday and the total unraveling of the Spanish politics meant that the project went nowhere. However, given that the situation right now is far more auspicious, perhaps it is time to rekindle the scheme and attempt to modernize the destroyer fleet of our nation once more."
SPR_new_armada:0 "A Solis Ortu Usque Ad Occasum"
SPR_new_armada_desc:0 "It is no new Armada, but the new Spanish fleet is far more capable of facing the trials and tribulations of this new naval era, and thanks to the reforms, the fleet is far more capable of projecting power in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, aiding the new revanchist ambitions of our kingdom to a much greater degree than before."

Our Legionaries and Regulares troops have been utilized as shock troops in the past, and thus we could use the help of the German veterans in improving our military forces in the use of these lightning attacks. After all, if the next war is as static as the last, we must be prepared to counter the defensive formations of our enemies."

SPR_propose_iberia:0 "A New Iberian Union?"
SPR_iberian_flag_picker:0 "Pick a Flag"

## Events ##

sprd.1133.t:0 "A New Iberian Union?"
sprd.1133.d:0 "As we have now joined a faction with Portugal, the national borders of Iberia have slowly started to dissolve since troop and economic movements are becoming commonplace. For both Portuguese and Spanish monarchists, this newfound close bond has rekindled an old idea of an Iberian union, an empire uniting both halves of the Pyrenean peninsula, in our case in a dual monarchy. This would allow us to better withstand the French threat, and given that such an union has historical basis in the former dual monarchy, Iberian Union, that existed between 1580 and 1640. Should we pursue this idea further and seek to propose the union to our Portuguese counterparts?"
sprd.1133.a:0 "No, Spain is already enough to govern."
sprd.1133.b:0 "Yes, send the message to Portuguese crown."

sprd.1135.t:0 "Portugal Agrees!"
sprd.1135.d:0 "The Portuguese monarchy has agreed to our proposal, and now our administrations will be interlinked into a single empire governing the entirety of the Peninsula, the ideas of Iberian Union rekindled once more!"
sprd.1135.a:0 "Excellent news."

sprd.1136.t:0 "Portugal Declines!"
sprd.1136.d:0 "The Portuguese government has found our proposal utterly ridiculous and has refused to accept it. The dreams of united Iberia lay in ruins following their stubbornness!"
sprd.1136.a:0 "Worth a shot, anyway."

sprd.1137.t:0 "Choosing a New Iberian Flag"
sprd.1137.desc:0 "As the Portuguese part of Iberia now stands firm as a part of [SPR.GetNameDef], a newfound sense of unity has arrived to the two peoples, so long separated by artificial differences. With Portugal and Spain now a singular entity united in cause and purpose, many citizens of these states have found it difficult to adjust to the new situation and adopt an identity that is neither Spanish nor Portuguese but Iberian. Still, a newfound sense of Iberism sweeps across the peninsula, and many new clubs, committees and parties are being set up to match the realities of this new union on all levels, be they administrative, cultural, political or just linguistic. As our cultures grow closer, the question of a proper national flag for our union has been raised. We can obviously keep the current design, uniting the colours of our two nations, but another option would be to create a wholly new design, one using the regal purple and an elaborate vine design mixed a vertical stripe of Iberia’s two halves colours. Finally, we could adopt an Austrian style flag with a double eagle to celebrate our Habsburg roots and the dual monarchy."
sprd.1137.a:0 "The standard design is good."
sprd.1137.b:0 "Adopt the purple design."
sprd.1137.c:0 "Go with the Austrian design."
sprd.1137.d:0 "Disable the flag picker decision."

### Austria Focuses ###
SPR_join_austria:0 "Calls of the Catholic Empire"
SPR_join_austria_desc:0 "No other faction in Europe cares as much about the good cause of the Catholics as the Austrians and their subjects do. As such, we must link shields with those noble and pious soldiers, to fight back against the tide of Protestant delusion and atheist godlessness that has engulfed Europe for far too long. Perhaps with their help we can restore true Christian faith to Europe once more."
SPR_habsburg_ties:0 "Reaffirming Dynastic Ties"
SPR_habsburg_ties_desc:0 "While the Austrians emerged victorious in the Weltkrieg, their situation has been precarious ever since, and the war hardly fixed the many issues their dysfunctional realm had. Quite frankly, it probably only made them more numerous. Nonetheless, as fellow Habsburgs, we must reaffirm our dynastic ties to them and unite our two causes under one to better manage our realms."
SPR_daimler_and_czech_machines:0 "The Cold Steel of Daimler and Skoda"
SPR_daimler_and_czech_machines_desc:0 "Austria and its empire houses many distinguished factories and manufacturers of armoured vehicles, often in capacity that greatly outpaces ours. We should send delegations to secure contracts for Austrian and Czech vehicles to ease the burden on our own tank factories. These new designs can then be analyzed and developed further to again further our own knowledge on the matters of tank-building."
SPR_learn_from_gebirgstruppen:0 "Edelweiss Shines on the Pyrenees"
SPR_learn_from_gebirgstruppen_desc:0 "The Austrian Gebirgstruppen are experts of mountain warfare, having learned plenty of skills during the bitter fighting against the Italians during the Weltkrieg. We should ask the Austrians to send their advisors to train our mountaineers and Carabineros on the Pyrenean mountains as well."
SPR_drilling_with_kuks:0 "Learning From the k.u.k Armee"
SPR_drilling_with_kuks_desc:0 "The Austrian k.u.k Armee, consisting of a huge array of different minorities and different languages, is not always the most effective force, but they’ve undergone genuine innovation to make their large army work. As Spain hosts plenty of minorities as well, we could learn their administrative skills to better help us integrate Catalans, Asturians, Basques, Rifian Regulares and Galicians into our organization."
SPR_contacts_with_austrian_intelligentsia:0 "Contacts With Europe's Culture Capital"
SPR_contacts_with_austrian_intelligentsia_desc:0 "Being one of the most prestigious circles of European art, culture and academia, Vienna is the natural place to send Spain’s intelligentsia to. There, we hope, they may contribute into the discussion and debate of Austrian and their imperial subjects’ intellectuals as well. With the help of Viennese universities and research centres, our experts will acquire new skills unlike anything we’ve seen before."
SPR_join_the_vienna_circle:0 "Spanish Intelligentsia Within the Vienna Circle"
SPR_join_the_vienna_circle_desc:0 "The newly formed Vienna Circle provides an unique chance to fast-track Spain’s development into a truly European nation, with Austrian, Illyrian, Hungarian and Czech academics helping their Spanish colleagues come to term with various advanced theories and conventions utilized by our more developed European relatives."

### Radical Entente Focuses ###
SPR_radical_entente:0 "Rebirth of the Radical Entente"
SPR_radical_entente_desc:0 "The Radical Entente was once an international organization modelled on the socialist internationals which gathered liberal parties and ideologies under its umbrella. However, it quickly fell out of favor as the status quo changed after the twin revolutions in France and Britain, which meant it faded into obscurity together with liberal democracy in most of the continent. It is now time for Spain to carry the torch of liberalism, for we are to revive this organization and make sure it sticks around this time, finding like minded liberals and leftists with which we can reform Europe and perhaps start dreaming of bigger things."
SPR_kill_fake_jacobins:0 "End the Bastardized \"Jacobins\""
SPR_kill_fake_jacobins_desc:0 "The Jacobins were the political group that spearheaded the progressive and republican struggle during the early French revolution. While it soon turned radical and downright fanatically violent due the rise in predominance of some of its political factions, we remember their legacy as the one we must draw influence from for our beliefs. And yet, the accursed Communards claim to be the “true” successors to the Jacobin legacy, while we know that the only thing they are the successors of is of the fanatical devotion to violence that took down the original Jacobins. We must right this historical wrong."
SPR_radicalism_unleashed:0 "European Spirit Blossoms From Iberia"
SPR_radicalism_unleashed_desc:0 "Europe is the cradle of the modern global order, with its influence having been spread all over the world thanks to the many empires it has housed, not least of which was the Spanish empire of yesteryear. And all of these empires brought on great riches, industrialization and development to all of them. Yet Spain fell far behind its European peers, becoming a backwater on the continent. This is why we must make Spain truly European, to bring it forth to modernity and make it an equal among its peers, and perhaps even the new center of a European culture. In addition to this, there will be cultural fairs and debates amongst the academia of our allies in order to further spread our ideological goals throughout the continent."
SPR_Economic_Freedom:0 "Global Liberal Economic Awakening"
SPR_Economic_Freedom_desc:0 "One of the pillars of personal freedom according to liberalism is the open and free transfer of goods so as to bring about greater economic freedom, development and equality. While the world had become a much more open space for global trading before the Weltkrieg, the collapse of the old liberal order and the establishment of protectionist or isolated blocs as well as the recent Black Monday crisis have taken a sledgehammer to these previous freedoms. As one of the last countries to preach the righteousness of the liberal approach to global trading, it is our duty to spread its message and benefits to as many nations as we can so we can restart what the Weltkrieg stopped on its tracks."
SPR_True_Interests_of_the_Downtrodden:0 "Guarantee Man's Birthright"
SPR_True_Interests_of_the_Downtrodden_desc:0 "A man’s birthright, we believe, are the personal freedoms he is entitled to. A freedom to preach his religion or lack thereof, to espouse his personal political ideals, to ensure the law is applied fairly to him and to everyone without discrimination, to be granted equal economic opportunities, and to live a free and fulfilling life, all without barriers or threats to prosecution. We must amend our constitution to make sure these inalienable rights are enshrined in it and so our citizens are the freest in the whole world."
SPR_Protect_Latin_America:0 "Spearhead of Liberal Hispanism"
SPR_Protect_Latin_America_desc:0 "Latin America, perhaps due to the legacy of a lack of responsible colonial government by our forefathers, has never been the most stable of places since its countries got their independence roughly a century ago. Be it monarchs, caudillos, dictators and more, they have made democracy a precious commodity rather than the norm and a right of the people. We must do our best to foment democracy in Latin America, through our contacts with intellectuals and political figures as well as treaties and influence, so that our Hispanic brothers are more akin to us and our values."
SPR_Restore_Faith_in_Democracy:0 "Vanguard of Democratic Restoration"
SPR_Restore_Faith_in_Democracy_desc:0 "If the world is to know an era of democracy, such miracle will not come easily. Radical Entente must stand as a beacon of the democratic and liberal dream, in a time when the American collapse has shown us so clearly the failures of the ideology. With the torch of Lady Liberty dimming, it is up to us, the forgotten radicals of the old order, to rekindle it and bring true enlightenment of the masses to a world that so deeply yearns for it."
SPR_Resurgence_of_Radicalism:0 "Storm the Modern Bastilles"
SPR_Resurgence_of_Radicalism_desc:0 "The world of today is filled with tyrants of all kinds, and as the Earth devolves into further anarchy and war, these human leeches will only crawl from the shadows in ever larger numbers. It is left to us, members of the Radical Entente, torchbearers of liberty, European modernism and individual spirit, to destroy these modern Robespierres and Napoleons, who would only seek to perverse the achievements of man to suit their despotic needs."

SPR_the_impossible_position_desc:0 "While it has been a difficult task to convince most of Spain we are not bloodthirsty revolutionaries like what the popular consciousness image of the Third International is, we must still pick a side in the upcoming global struggle. However, we will not pick a side out of political convenience alone. We must find allies which share our ideals and whose cause is just so that we don’t end up fighting for those whose beliefs are antithetical to ours."
SPR_the_unholy_alliance:0 "The Unholy Alliance"
SPR_the_unholy_alliance_desc:0 "Despite our ideological differences, we can at least recognize the fact that our fellow revolutionaries haven’t fallen to the ideological madness proposed by Mosley’s Totalist Manifesto. As such, we can still find common ground in our socialist leanings, even if we’ll never be full revolutionary allies due to our other ideological differences. We’ll use this common ground to negotiate a non-aggression pact with the Communards, and thus settle the issue of our northern border and allow us to focus on more pressing matters."
SPR_kill_fake_syndies:0 "Destroy the Betrayers of Marx"
SPR_kill_fake_syndies_desc:0 "The Communards of France have long abandoned any pretense of even paying lip service to the socialist ideals proposed by Karl Marx, having instead butchered his teachings and adopted the reprehensible Totalist manifesto as their ideology, which means we can no longer consider them as our fellow socialist brethren. We must put an end to this madness and restore sensible revolutionary ideals into our French brothers, lest they keep oppressing the proletariat they claim to represent and spread their dangerous ideology."
SPR_focus_on_africa:0 "The Status of Spanish Africa"
SPR_focus_on_africa_desc:0 "While our socialist teachings mean that we are categorically opposed to colonialism, as it is a form of oppression and exploitation of the lesser developed civilizations, we also have to face the current political realities of the Kingdom of Spain, which has long been a colonial power and simply letting our colonies go free would be a very unpopular move with the general populace. Instead, we are to reform their colonial statuses, giving them a much higher degree of autonomy to handle their own internal matters and lessen the administrative strain of the central government. Although not the full independence we desire for them, this should be a stepping stone to prepare them for independence once we are in a position to more confidently assert our agenda. "
SPR_armed_neutrality:0 "Armed Neutrality"
SPR_armed_neutrality_desc:0 "Having learned from the horrors of the Weltkrieg and being pacifists ourselves, we see no need to involve ourselves in the inevitable global struggle and send thousands of our best and brightest to die in a war in which we have nothing to gain. We will continue building our prosperity in peace, but make sure to be more than prepared for war should it come knocking on our door, for we remember the plight of the Belgians."
SPR_Allign_With_Moderate_Leftists:0 "Seek Leftist Democratic Allies"
SPR_Allign_With_Moderate_Leftists_desc:0 "The selection of global alliances we have been given are not ones we are particularly fond of joining, due to fundamental differences in our ideological leanings. Whether it be joining who one would presume our comrades in the Internationale who have turned too radical for our tastes, the Entente which seeks to maintain a more reactionary outlook, or the Japanese who are trying to claim their place in the sun as a global power. However, we have long standing relations with the SPD in Germany and some moderate leftist factions in Russia. If they are to be in control of their nations, then we’d know we would have a reliable partner that aligns with our ideals and that we can trust."
SPR_SOI_Faction:0 "Solidaridad Obrera Internacional"
SPR_SOI_Faction_desc:0 "The shift in ideology in the Third Internationale has left us disillusioned at the prospect of joining our fellow socialists, as they have become more radical in their ideological outlook and their quest for revenge against the Reichspakt. However, we know that they are not the only ones with a vendetta against the Germans, and that we cannot just sit out the storm and naïvely hope that it leaves us unscathed as it passes by. We will find fellow like-minded leftists and socialists who we’ll be able to stand side by side with so that we are able to further our common goals and protect each other should the worst come to pass."
SPR_kill_portugal:0 "Turn Iberia Red"
SPR_kill_portugal_desc:0 "Uniting the Iberian Peninsula is not a new concept. Whether it be the Roman conquest of Hispania, the Muslim conquest of Al-Andalus or most recently the Iberian Union between 1580 and 1640, uniting the entirety of the region has been the logical endpoint of most entities that have inhabited it since Roman times. Many elements of the Spanish left also believe it is part of their revolutionary destiny to topple Portugal’s reactionary government and finally unite the peninsula even if it means the king will rule over this new realm, be it by the pen or the sword."

Following a major upheaval, the left-wing coalition of socialists and syndicalists won in the elections, and now possess the reins of government, but much to the surprise of Spain’s reactionaries, they have remained loyal to the constitution, monarchy and democracy. Unable to join the Internationale as it would cause the country to spiral into a civil war, Spanish government has instead formed their own alliance of moderate left-wing and socialist parties with the aim of uniting the wayward parliamentary labourites under one banner, away from the revolutionary antics of the Internationale. This Solidaridad Obrera Internacional would serve as anti-reactionary and anti-authoritarian force in the world, defending democratic socialists, progressives and parliamentary syndicalists from the wolves of the world until every single working man is free.

By establishing a strong surveillance and counter-intelligence net over Spain, we can gather information from all over the globe in our cities, intercepting messages, radio signals and interrogating captured infiltrators.

sprf.24.t:0 "The Spanish Offer"
sprf.24.d:0 "The Spanish Kingdom has long been a thorn in our side; a weak thorn but one nonetheless. Few in the Commune expected the monarchists of Spain to be able to save their rapidly crumbling order from a civil war, but it would appear that the nation did not collapse fully and in fact, some may even claim that Spain, for the first time in decades, is thriving.\n\nPartially this is because of the recently elected, openly left-wing government with socialist and syndicalist ideas. While these ‘socialists’ are of course lapdogs to the monarchy in Spain, they are nonetheless far more amiable partner to the Internationale. Despite the changed relationship, nobody expected the new government there to be so brazen as to offer a solution to the Pyrenean problem.\n\nThe Spanish government has suggested that the Commune and Spain enact a pact of non-aggression between the two countries to fully stabilize the Pyrenean peninsula and allow for peaceful coexistence between the kingdom and syndicalists.\nWhile this offer has been met with immediate rejection by the more hawkish members of the French syndicalist order, others have pondered on the situation more and recommended that we agree upon the deal as it would free up quite a bit of troops from the Pyrenean border, troops that are sorely needed against the German and reactionary Algiers menace."

sprf.24.b:0 "Reject the offer."

sprf.25.t:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Response"

sprf.25.a:0 "Good!"

sprf.26.t:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Response"
sprf.26.d:0 "In a ridiculous display of short-sightedness, it appears that the Communards have refused our well-intentioned proposal of a non-aggression pact and reset in relations between our two countries. For now at least, the Pyrenean border will remain militarised and our northern border a potential threat."
sprf.26.a:0 "We should've never trusted them!"

sprf.27.t:0 "No More a Cork on the Waves"
sprf.27.desc:0 "We cannot rely on armed neutrality in these trying times. The world is churning, and the European continent is mere moments from being totally eclipsed by the chaos of another Weltkrieg, with the seeds of the current anarchy planted decades ago in the negotiation tables of Germany, France and Russia. Without allies, Spain is left like a cork on the waves, bouncing from storm to another until it is finally sunk under the weight of the troubles. We must reach out to possible allies now, when no real foe threatens us yet. However, despite what some alarmists claim, we must not be hasty to throw our lot into any alliance, but instead, the current socialist government seeks to find a way to ally ourself with a nation that represents the values for which the Spanish people gave their mandate to. As such, we must weigh the options present carefully, and only align ourselves with a nation that is truly democratic, progressive and opposed to mindless nationalism and radicalism."

sprf.28.d:0 "The left-wing government of the Kingdom of Spain has sent an official delegate to our nation, aiming to secure a place for the resurgent Iberian country within our alliance. They put emphasis on the need for allies in these unstable times, and cite our ideological commonalities and existing relationships between key politicians as a reason for this offer. Many within the government seem to agree with this proposal, but there are also those who see such a venture as too risky given the unstable situation in Iberia."

A grave blow to the diplomatic efforts of our government, it would appear that we must now cope alone in this storm-filled world."
sprf.30.a:0 "Damnit!"

sprf.31.t:0 "Our Spanish Comrades?"
sprf.31.d:0 "The Kingdom of Spain, located on the faraway Iberian peninsula, has recently reached out to us. Recently, in a major surprise, a left-wing government of rather moderate nature came to power in Spain, representing Spain’s workers but bereft of the revolutionary tendencies of most Iberian socialists and syndicalists. The King was retained and parliamentary democracy remained, and following this major dark horse triumph, the nation has begun to step their toes into the waters of international politics. The new Spanish government however is uninterested in joining just about any alliance, claiming that there are enough reactionaries and would-be autocrats in the world for them to deal with in the dominant global factions. As such, they have turned towards us, the torchbearers of Russian liberty, in hopes of aligning with our alliance. Many Spanish labour activists came to Russia during the civil war to observe the developing socialist regime, and while many were critical of the Bolsheviks’ tendency for authoritarianism, the Spaniards formed long-standing bonds with more moderate left-wing forces in Russia. Now, they wish to ally with us once more, citing old good relations between our two nations."
sprf.31.a:0 "Why not?"
sprf.31.b:0 "A monarchy? In our alliance? Of course not!"

sprf.33.t:0 "Spain Invites Us to Open Borders"
sprf.33.d:0 "The Spanish liberal government has approached us with the intention of lessening border controls and tariffs between our nations, citing the need for a more open and internationalized trade policy between the radical liberals of the world. The Spanish government has suggested that the countries of the Radical Entente adopt a policy of free trade and relatively open travel of citizens between our nations. That way, the merchants and academics of all nations can better access internal markets of the Radical Entente’s nations. Needless to say that the economic effects of this would be great in the short term, but many fear that it would allow Spanish business to leverage its on-going economic boom to take over key industries in our nation, not to mention that open borders can cause certain unscrupulous individuals from our enemy nations to abuse this for espionage and criminal reasons. Still, it is an opportunity the government must wisely weigh before accepting or declining, as the economic prosperity or security of our nation may rest on this decision."
sprf.33.a:0 "Sounds good."
sprf.33.b:0 "This is not worth pursuing."

sprf.34.t:0 "Final Folly of Tyrants?"
sprf.34.d:0 "The world of today is boiling over with autocrats and totalitarian monsters, utilizing the economic downturn caused by the Black Monday and the looming European war to spout their hateful and oppressive ideologies. While the Radical Entente was created to protect the liberal and free nations of the world, more hawkish members of our great alliance have been eager to take the fight to the great enemy, be it the absolutist monarch, red-coated dictator or a dangerous populist nationalist. These warhawks call for the alliance to stride forth from our bastions of liberty, and like the Jacobins of old, we must break apart the modern Bastilles, until those kept under the iron boot of authoritarianism shall breath free, and a world of peace, prosperity and freedom can be created.\n\nGiven the alliance’s original aim of pacifism, these statements have been met with a great deal of controversy, and fierce debates have broken out on the role of the Radical Entente in global politics. Still, even if our alliance is one of peace, can it really stand idle as such horrid machines of exploitation as the Mittelafrika exist in the world? To many within our ranks, it is a sacred duty of us free men to march for the salvation of others, even if it means bleeding and dying for the cause of global freedom. Spain, as the leader of the alliance, has a great deal of say in the matter, and thus it falls upon the government in Madrid to choose if the warhawks have a point or whether our pacifist policies will hold and the Radical Entente shall remain a bystander in the global matters."
sprf.34.a:0 "Liberation by sword will free the world faster than gradual thawing of authoritarian regimes."
sprf.34.b:0 "We cannot abandon our pacifist roots so quickly."

However, the collapse of Black Monday showed us just how horrible the results of such overreliance on other states can cause, and thus the current government of Spain has sought it best to ensure the dominance of Spanish products in local markets through protectionist measures and tariffs on foreign goods, with the main exception being Latin American nations, the long time preferred trade partners of Spain."

De Maetzu takes it further by exhorting the virtues of the Hispanic race as superior to those of other, more backwards races, who are incapable of such equality between men as their Hispanic counterparts. The spiritual unity of Hispanidad will reconnect Spain to its former colonies through shared vision and faith, while denouncing the separatist delusions of the Catalans and Basques who think of themselves as separate from this great millenia-spanning construct of Spain’s might."

If we were to issue an ultimatum for them to join us, they would likely have little to no chances of actually resiting us, and would likely simply fall in with the rest of our big tent party, abandoning all hopes of ever restoring their pretender king.

Measures were taken in 1932 to counteract this, by creating a popular front out of liberal, socialist and even communist parties, as this union would be able to hold back the right-wing hordes. The military coup of Sanjurjada put an end to these plans, but we can now restore the alliance to defeat fanatics like Accion Popular in next elections"

However, our nation has never truly embraced it in full, primarily because of the influence of the Catholic Church keeping our people from the light of Jacobinism and the general backwardness of our nation, preventing us from fully uplifting our people towards Enlightenment . Now that we, the true heirs of Jacobinism in Spain and not the Reds beyond the border, are at the helm of the nation, even though we cannot bring true Jacobinism to the Spanish masses with our compromise with the monarchy, we can implement aspects of our radical plans for the Spanish masses, and bring them the light of Jacobinism through a very Spanish lens."

Under his ‘guidance’, the Partido Radical has become a heavily compromised party of the right. And now, as we held the mantle of state leadership, it is time to put an end to this rotten corpse of dead radical dreams, as we launch an investigation towards Lerroux’s party, hopefully putting an end to their miserable existence and ridding the Spanish nation of one more haven of backwardness."

As such, our party is close to having a schism on whether to embrace certain ideas of moderated socialism of the old RSRP while maintaining our radical liberal core, or to commit to the original social liberal doctrine of the old Radical Democratic Party.

Their influence has been a disaster, as for centuries, they have been the reason why our people remained in abject backwardness, while the world moved towards modernity and enlightenment, and furthermore, they fuel the rise of various reactionary movements seeking to tear down our infantile democracy, from the Carlists, the radicals within the Acción Popular’s Greenshirts to various Catholic reactionary cliques festering within our state’s bureaucracy and army. It is up to us, the Spanish Jacobins, to drag our nation towards modernity by severing these malicious influences from the nation’s politics, through secularization of various state functions such as education, workers’ unions, and anywhere else that the Church could be using against us. Even if the process might be slow and arduous, and we might not be able to fully turn the nation towards the peace and progress that secularism brings immediately, our efforts at least will help clear off the Catholic reactionary taint that plagues our nation."

As we consolidate our hold over the Kingdom, we must reel in these parties into our control, either through coalitions or outright integration, especially the Blasquists of PURA, who, despite their best intentions to remain one of the true inheritors of the Radical spirit, have suffered as they drifted dangerously close to the right wing, especially close to Lerroux’s party within the years of monarchist rule."

Throughout our existence, we have been in a constant struggle towards republicanism and a Radical, yet still Spanish democracy. Even if we have put our Republican idealism behind, the fiery legacy and ideals of Jacobinism and Spanish Radicalism remains in our hearts, and we shall make sure all remembers that as we march forth, to bring the Spanish nation the promises of modern Enlightenment and Radicalism that we have promised strive for all those years ago ever since the Radical Republican Party’s inception, and especially with the Pact of San Sebastián we signed all those years ago."

While we draw a considerable number of our votes from the working class, we must also look out for the small businesses and entrepreneurs of this land, partially because of their economic support of our regime and partially to take support off Alcala-Zamora’s progressives. While we won’t support large industrial conglomerates and corporations, which would alienate our worker supporters, we can direct funds towards smaller businesses that will help Spain recover from the massive damage brought upon it by those mismanaging Germans and their worthless lackeys."

As we set forth to reinvent the image of just what it means to be a member of Partido Radical, we must make sure that these monarchists will not become a subversive elements steering us too far into abandoning our true Jacobin values. Even though we must now work within the monarchist system and accept the king as head of state, that does not mean that we are bound to like this change.

SPR_Mistakes_of_the_Past_desc:0 "It is no secret that Alejandro Lerroux is a man of many vices and controversies. Corruption scandals within the original PRR led to multiple electoral hits and his many enemies in Barcelona drove him to swap districts in the past. The years where corruption, bribery and even blackmail have been allowed within Partido Radical have tarnished our reputation, and our slow but steady shift towards the right politically have led to splits within Spanish radicals, first as the Radical-Socialists and Martinez Barrio’s Democratic Radicals left our party.

We have thought that our position as one of the big dogs of Spanish politics allows us to sink further into corruption and grift, but all it has brought to us is a disillusioned voter base and Kingdom’s authorities waiting for the next scandal to thoroughly dismantle our party. It is time to sweep away the corrupted elements of Partido Radical and approach our former comrades with a gesture of goodwill. They may not outright join us, but at least we can reignite collaboration and lead Spain towards a better future, under the united Radical banner. Unity is needed as long as the monarch stands over us, with his lapdogs in Accion Popular looking to oppose any attempts to pull Spain out of the Middle Ages."

Given all the scandals and crises, one would assume us finished, yet here we still stand. Some, such as Partido Radical politician Rafael Salazar Alonso, have even suggested that our callous tactics are the reason we have remained so relevant, as we can better shift our political position to fit the needs of the day and attain information or support through less than legal means where our rivals are too bound by a misplaced sense of morality to do so. After all, as long as we can keep our more underhanded actions safe from prying eyes, what harm could a little extra grease in the political machine do?"

SPR_Return_to_Lerrouxism_desc:0 "Our enemies have long used the term Lerrouxism as a derogatory term for us, utilizing our less chivalrous principles of governance as fuel for their anti-Radical fires. Perhaps it is time to adopt that term to our use and truly reform the party into what it was meant to be, back to grassroots populism and anti-clericalism. The church has only been a lackey of the crown, and continues to spread its tendrils into places it was never meant to be in. We, young barbarians of Lerrouxism, will finally sweep away the primordial Spain, replacing it with a truly new, radical and enlightened form. Partido Radical may have undergone shifts in its policy for a long time now, and it is clear this direction may lead us to ruin, so it seems that going back to the roots of Lerrouxism is the way forward."
SPR_Moderated_Regionalism:0 "Regionalist Liberation Through Moderation"
SPR_Moderated_Regionalism_desc:0 "Partido Radical has long resisted the Catalan calls for separatism or greater autonomy, partly because of a commitment to original Jacobin values of an united state, and partly because Spanish immigrant workers in Catalonia form a big base of our voters. However, if we are to keep Spain together and not fall into a dozen regionalist revolts, we must make some concessions to the various minorities. This will likely cause us some votes in the short term, but may help us regain some goodwill lost in many of our scandals. If that is a necessary compromise for staying in power, then so be it."

Not long ago, those very same separatist scum made an attempt on the king’s life, and while we’re by no means friends of Alfonso or his offspring, it is clear that we share a similar goal in the eradication of this dangerous cult that is Catalan independence movement. Carabineros, Guardia Civil and even Radical supporters from the Valencian PURA party will begin a hunt for these delusional regionalists, and we will ensure that each and every one of them will be brought to justice for their crimes. It will serve as a warning to any other minorities who seek to harm the social cohesion of Spain, be they Basque, Galician or Valencian."

SPR_Populist_Spain_desc:0 "Before the recent elections, few expected Partido Radical to recover to its former might. Yet Alejandro Lerroux and his allies have proven everyone wrong, guiding Spain into a new era of democracy under king. While tensions between the crown and Radicals still run high, the storm brewing over Spain less than a year before seems to have dissipated, at least partially. The direction of Partido Radical still remains as somewhat of a mystery, but steps taken by the party after its victory have made it possible for Lerrouxist Radicals to remain as a competent and strong force of Spanish politics once more."

Even though this position at the moment is being contested by the Acción Popular, we can work to change this. As we now hold the reins of the nation through the people’s mandate, we can implement certain policies in favour of the Catholic masses, as well as appealing to them through newspapers, posters, rallies and such, and highlighting the AP’s own radicalism and anti-democratic elements, such as their own Greenshirts’ actions against own young democracy.

Unfortunately, in the brief time that we cooperated with the leftist Republicans during the Second Republic’s brief existence, being the staunch conservative that he was, he has left us to form his own Conservative party, the Partido Republicano Conservador who turned to support the monarchy after the Restoration. However, this did not do them any favours, with the rise of the Acción Popular taking their niche in politics, and thus they have been experiencing a decline in popularity and membership. With our party free from the leftists’ chains, we can finally bring these prodigal sons back and to unite our parties once more, solidifying our dominant position among the moderate centre right of Spanish politics."

However, the monarchy is now here to stay. And thus, in the end monarchism has won out, and we must now accept the fact that we have to return to our monarchist roots in order to have a place in the new order. However, this does not mean we cannot attempt to perfect this system, and make it better for our people.

The Pact of San Sebastián, which we were one of its signatories, was a noble but unfulfilled attempt at creating a truly equitable and equal Republic of Spanish peoples. However, now that we now held the reigns of power unopposed, it is time we fulfill, if not the promise of republican idealism, then at least the promise of a Spanish community of equal peoples within one nation, this time under a monarchy that will not trample on the rights of the many peoples of the nation."

However, while we have a foothold in the rural regions, we have yet to fully control the electorate here, and furthermore, we remain a niche party within the urban electorate in Barcelona and BIlbao, where the centers of industry are. However, there are certain elements who are popular in these regions. First is Alejandro Lerroux and his Partido Radical, who is popular in urban centres and have been leaning closer to the right-wing despite starting off as a left-wing anti clerical party. While their nature would sound like they would be hard pressed to be in coalition with a Catholic-oriented party like us, they have been known to be ‘loose’ with their incentives, and with a few ‘material’ incentives, they can be persuaded to work with us. Second is the Partido Agrario, a minor monarchist conservative party whose agenda is similar to ours, but appeals specifically to the rural gentry and landowning classes. Because of their minor status, we can strong-arm them into our new right-wing coalition and potentially even absorb them, preventing other, more radically right wing movements from absorbing them, while bolstering our own popularity with the rural gentry. With these new coalition 'partners', we can create a broad dominant right-wing coalition to counter the worker dominated urban and rural electorates, which are strongholds of left-wing radicals of the various left-wing parties and organizations of the PSOE, CNT-FAI, Izquierda Española and so on."

No, they shall be eliminated with the harshest methods we could muster, for there will be no peace as long as these maggots of yore still fester our nation."

SPR_The_Second_Election_desc:0 "Spanish democracy has bloomed over the last years, causing many Spaniards to abandon their pessimistic attitudes towards voting. However, the mandate of the people does not last forever, and the time to hold elections has once again arrived.

SPR_Steering_the_Stable_Ship_Onwards_desc:0 "Despite all the crises, the compromises we have had to make and the tense situation we faced in ‘36 and ‘37, Derecha Liberal Española has shown its ability to govern according to the needs of the masses. With our leadership, Spain has been pulled away from the brink of the oblivion, as DLE has removed those who would willingly cast us into the abyss and allied with those who would fight for the righteous cause of national rejuvenation through moderate action. Much work remains ahead of us, but DLE’s stable ship shall steam onwards through any storms that may come our way."
SPR_Usurping_Accion_Populars_Mantle:0 "Triumph of the True Democratic Monarchists"
SPR_Usurping_Accion_Populars_Mantle_desc:0 "Accion Popular may claim to be the true monarchist party of Spain, but we know better. They are nothing but power-hungry opportunists, who would sell the monarch to the devil if it allowed them to gain more power. While DLE and its leader, Niceto Alcala-Zamora, have had various views of the monarchy throughout the years, the work done to fit our party into the confines of the new kingdom has allowed us to claim the mantle of true monarchists of Spain, not the would-be oligarchs of AP."
SPR_The_Liberal_Boom:0 "The Invisible Hand, Unbound"
SPR_The_Liberal_Boom_desc:0 "DLE has always been, at its heart, a party of many mixed views, ones of progressivism, liberalism and conservatism regarding our policies. But our economic views have remained largely the same, in that out of all Spanish parties, we support the functioning of the free market on its own as an almost sacred value. If Spain’s economy is to improve, we must allow the industrialists, bankers and entrepreneurs of Spain to work unimpeded. After all, if the economy is shackled by such evils as socialism, corporatism or interventionism, how can the people ever truly gain freedom either?"
SPR_Denouncing_Authoritarianism_Worldwide:0 "Our Place in the Struggle Against Tyranny"
SPR_Denouncing_Authoritarianism_Worldwide_desc:0 "The world of today hosts many tyrants and opportunist warlords seeking to extinguish the people’s right to freedom. Charterism, ultranationalism, corrupt oligarchism and legionarism would all seek to drown out the torches of liberalism, blinding the beacons of enlightenment and bringing down an age of darkness upon the world. We must denounce such maniacs and if need be, bring the fight to them, for the good of mankind. We must seek ways to achieve a world where the dictators are the ones living in fear, not their subjects."

SPR_Marketing_Monarchy_to_the_Masses_desc:0 "Spanish public is, rightfully, suspicious of the monarchy, mainly because of its endorsement of the two dictatorships we had to endure in the last two decades. However, the new house under our young king seems committed to fixing the damages caused by those years, and as long as the king retains his promise to ensure the functioning of democracy in Spain, we shall nudge the masses slowly towards a more pro-monarchy stance."
SPR_Elitism_Left_Behind:0 "Leaving Elitism Behind Forevermore"
SPR_Elitism_Left_Behind_desc:0 "DLE was, from the start, a highly elitism party, made up of well-off businessmen, liberal intellectuals and progressive military men. Yet the Spanish people cannot resonate with us if we maintain such aloof and detached stance, and as such, the party must enact reforms that would make us closer to the Spanish people. After all, we are the true saviours of Spain, protecting it through moderate yet decisive policy-making, and if we cannot understand the people, we cannot understand their needs either."

### AP Reelected Tree ###

SPR_ap_reelected:0 "AP Takes the Reins for King and Church!"
SPR_ap_reelected_desc:0 "The most fervent monarchists have secured the people’s mandate once more, leading Spain towards a new dawn, the loyalty to the House of Bourbon unquestionable and their hatred for the detractors of Spain’s glory immense. Under their rule, Spain will continue its path to recovery."

SPR_The_Divine_Mandate_desc:0 "Unlike what other parties may claim, we alone are Spain’s true monarchists, serving the King since the restoration of Bourbon monarchs to the throne in 1932, the military giving us reins to rule as is only just. Under our watchful gaze, no anarchist, republican nor Carlist shall seek to tear Spain apart, for even if we adhere to the institution of democracy, we still retain our authoritarian lineage for those who would cause harm to Eternal Spain."
SPR_Euthanize_Republicanism:0 "Euthanize Republicanism"
SPR_Euthanize_Republicanism_desc:0 "The Republican dream of a Spain without monarchs and nobles is preposterous, for who would guarantee stability if not the continued lineage of our leader? The republic tore itself apart in merely two years, and the military intervening to put it down was merely done out of mercy. However, great deal of Spaniards harbour ideologies and ideas completely antithetical to the Spanish nature, and the republic’s embers still glow bright under the surface of Spain’s politics. Accion Popular must make sure that they are finally extinguished for good."

SPR_Honouring_the_Generation_of_98_desc:0 "The Generation of ‘98 was a group of Spanish intellectuals, who became deeply affected by the loss of our Cuban colonies and the Spanish territory of Philippines. Championing for national regenerationism, these great men laid the groundwork for Spain’s struggle for survival, and with their guiding light, we can set upon the task of reclaiming Spain’s true glory."
SPR_Organic_Democracy:0 "Truly Organic Democracy"
SPR_Organic_Democracy_desc:0 "Instead of relying so heavily on governmental action and focusing on parliamentary politics that just polarize the Spanish people, we should instead take democracy to a more natural, organic level, where Spain’s smaller decision-making organs, be they communities, families or small organizations, have more influence on their matters. Due to political reasons, we cannot do away with the parliamentary system, at least for now, but we can divert power away from the party politics to the natural hierarchical systems of Spain’s smaller units."

SPR_Develop_the_Central_Regions_desc:0 "Given the sudden explosion of regionalist sentiments, we can no longer rely on cities like Barcelona or Bilbao to shoulder our industrial development. Giving weapons and factories to insurgents like Catalan Nosaltres Sols or Basque Aberrianos will only end badly for everyone, and thus we must focus on loyal regions like Castile, Extremadura, La Mancha and others, over the riotous separatist regions. While there are obviously good, honest patriots in Catalonia and Basque Country too, the risk is simply too much to ignore."

SPR_Monarchism_Marches_Onwards_desc:0 "Once more, the party of true monarchists marches onwards under the true king of Spain and his loyal right hand, El Jefe Gil-Robles! With Spain united under one banner, completely transformed from the republican confusion and insanity or the difficult years of one-party rule, Accion Popular has proven that its policies work, and continue to be the treatment Spain needs in these trying times. Only through iron grip and strong faith can Spain navigate the collapsing world order and emerge stronger than ever."

### PNE Elected Tree ###

SPR_pne_elected:0 "Legionaries of PNE Force a Victory at the Polls!"
SPR_pne_elected_desc:0 "The dark horse of Spain’s second elections, the legionaries of Albiñana have emerged victorious in the elections. A movement that started its career beating up political opponents and intimidating neutral politicians, Partido Nacionalista Español sees democracy as a mere means to an end, the end being a complete transformation of Spain towards non-Carlist traditionalism, mixed in with some progressive reforms towards education, health care and social services. Few expect PNE to adapt to a moderate platform, yet the direction of the movement still remains hazy for even the most keen-eyed political observators"
SPR_The_Odd_One_Out:0 "Stranger in a Strange System"
SPR_The_Odd_One_Out_desc:0 "PNE was never made for parliamentary politics, yet here it finds itself, running against the republican and socialist scum that mere years ago its followers fought in close combat on the streets of Spain’s cities. Yet Albiñana, satisfied with the banning of socialists and syndicalists from the elections, has decided that the movement could do well enough on the parliamentary stage. After all, fighting their enemies on the streets may have brought temporary results, but only a thorough clean-up of Spain through legitimate means can save it from its many domestic enemies."
SPR_Intimidate_the_Rabid_Leftists:0 "Purify Iberia From Syndicalist Rot"
SPR_Intimidate_the_Rabid_Leftists_desc:0 "The syndicalists may have been swayed from full-scale revolt by the bleeding hearts among them, but that does not mean that have changed. Even if the moderate wing of their organization is in charge now, there is no telling when the radicals wrest back the control and return to their terrorist ways. That would cause Spain to slip back into the anarchy and political violence of the last decade, and of course, the threat of Communard-sponsored revolution would return as well. As such, we must make sure that CNT-FAI is thoroughly exterminated from Spain, for the good of its people."
SPR_Burning_Heart_of_the_Countryside:0 "Burning Heart of the Countryside"
SPR_Burning_Heart_of_the_Countryside_desc:0 "Jose Maria Albiñana has always been attracted to traditionalism, though not in the heretical Carlist way but more in the sense that it is a natural expression of Spanish character to him, an integral part of Hispanidad. And while the cities have tended to lose this natural character, the Spanish countryside still remains as a beating heart of traditionalism, unbothered by modern delusions like liberalism and syndicalism. We must woo those traditionalists in the countryside who do not feel too strongly about the Carlist cause, such as Partido Agrario, and integrate them to serve the PNE’s gallant cause instead as fellow national-traditionalists."
SPR_A_New_Patriotic_Union:0 "A New Patriotic Union"
SPR_A_New_Patriotic_Union_desc:0 "The Patriotic Union, a project for a national party started by Miguel Primo de Rivera during the last years of his rule, was an ambitious program and one that was perhaps even too grandiose for the Spain of its time. Yet now, we have a chance of restoring the idea of a truly national party, aimed at uniting Spain’s peoples as one. For now, we must contend with the democratic framework, but if we focus on gathering enough support for the new Patriotic Union, we can dislodge our rivals to a point that we alone can muster the support needed for Spain to thrive under a strong leadership. This must become our new guideline, a way to defeat our rivals on their chosen battleground."
SPR_Spain_is_One_Not_Many:0 "Spain is One, Not Many"
SPR_Spain_is_One_Not_Many_desc:0 "Albiñana is a doctor by trade, and this profession has often mixed with his political views. A keen follower of anthropology and eugenics, he has followed the theories of Spain’s key anthropologists, especially the known traditionalist  Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo. Pelayo argues that links of blood and subjection to the same physical and moral identity bind the people of Spain together far more than their political and cultural element do. The duty of PNE is to promote this viewpoint to Spaniards, to make them forget their arbitrary picket lines and instead embrace their historical past as one people united through common legacy."
SPR_Street_Brawl_Democracy:0 "Fistfighter Democracy"
SPR_Street_Brawl_Democracy_desc:0 "While PNE undergoes growing pains to fit the democratic framework that the king supports, this has left many of our legionaries restless. However, while we adhere to basic democratic structures, there are still plenty of dissidents and criminals in Spain who do not deserve a spot within the Cortes and instead use their skills in sabotage and violence to push their political agendas. As such, we can kill two birds with one stone by sending our bored legionaries to harass these separatists, anarchists and other scum, as a protective measure to ensure that the legitimate democratic processes of Spain are not disrupted by Internationale agitators or separatist protesters."
SPR_State_Owned_Social_and_Health_Services:0 "Legionary Welfare Statism"
SPR_State_Owned_Social_and_Health_Services_desc:0 "In addition to his anti-syndicalist and anti-liberal attitudes, economically Albiñana has always been a staunch opponent of capitalism, and many within PNE agree with this. As such, Albiñana seeks to nationalize as many of the state functions to stop greedy capitalists from using private ventures to exploit Spaniards to pay for essential services. One of the main focuses of this new nationalization program is healthcare and social services, which would gain PNE quite a bit of goodwill and also remove the influence of would-be oligarchs from these services."
SPR_Hispanic_Supremacy:0 "Supremacy of the Hispanic Spirit"
SPR_Hispanic_Supremacy_desc:0 "The ideals of Hispanism are close to Albiñana’s heart, as he has long been interested in the pursuit of anthropology and eugenics, and his connections to South America have brought him closer to the former Spanish colonies as well. The doctor sees Spain as an unique whole, imbued with Hispanidad, multiple people imbued with a single cultural destiny and legacy that must be valued and celebrated above all else.."
SPR_Education_Belongs_to_Everyone:0 "Free the Iberian People From Ignorance"
SPR_Education_Belongs_to_Everyone_desc:0 "Another one of Albiñana’s social policies is the introduction of free higher education in Spain, making Spain one of the first nations in the world to adopt such an advanced measure. Albiñana believes that by making education easily available, it will allow Spain to develop new ideas and inventions that help our nation become even greater. In addition to this, the fewer uneducated workers we have, the less popular movements preying on simple workers will become, further decimating the anarchists and socialists of Spain."
SPR_Defanged_Legionarism:0 "Velvet-gloved Fist of Albiñana!"
SPR_Defanged_Legionarism_desc:0 "At the start of the their stewardship of Spain, many expected PNE to impose a dictatorship over Spain, and the riots that broke out in cities like Bilbao, Madrid and Barcelona after elections mirrored those of 1930. Yet now, PNE has proven the ideologues and hysterical protesters wrong, adhering to the democratic system while pursuing a pure, strong and traditional Spain under the strong but benevolent fist of the legionaries and its eccentric leader, Jose Maria Albiñana."

### PS Elected Tree ###

SPR_ps_elected:0 "Treintista Syndicalists Ride the Dark Horse!"
SPR_ps_elected_desc:0 "The moderate faction of CNT-FAI has grown more and more over the last two decades, but the creation of Partido Sindicalista was the final step towards legitimizing the anarchist movement of Spain. The party must now set on an ambitious program to prove their peaceful ways to the Spaniards, and only time will tell if they can ever succeed at solving the great paradox of possibilist libertarianism."
SPR_The_Paradox:0 "The Paradox"
SPR_The_Paradox_desc:0 "In a world where syndicalism is almost universally associated with the revolutionary regimes of Third Internationale, trying to implement it in a liberal democratic system, especially one under a monarchy, would seem impossible. Yet Ángel Pestaña, Partido Sindicalista’s leader, has never been a man to shy away from a challenge. As the party gets ready for its governorship period, multiple anarchist and syndicalist theorists, from Spain and abroad, have been called to help the government fix up its program and lead Spain towards a new dawn under a bold new system. The adjustment period will be immensely difficult, but the ministers of PS are optimistic that a completely new system can finally be brought into the world under their governance."
SPR_Delegitimize_the_Terrorists:0 "A Revolution is No Panacea"
SPR_Delegitimize_the_Terrorists_desc:0 "The moderates of CNT-FAI won out in the end and allowed Spain to steer away from the edge of civil war, but their rule over the movement was far from absolute, and as CNT-FAI crumbled under its polarized situation, many ardent faistas, such as Cipriano Mera and Buenaventura Durruti left the movement to continue their terrorist ways against the government. We cannot allow these rogue elements to ruin the goodwill we have been able to gain after going moderate, and thus we must make sure that these dissidents are either captured, converted or exiled from Iberia."
SPR_From_Corrupt_Oligarchs_to_Direct_Democracy:0 "Municipalities of Mass Mobilization"
SPR_From_Corrupt_Oligarchs_to_Direct_Democracy_desc:0 "To circumvent the problems of representation that liberal democracy inherently have, PS has introduced a whole swath of legislative measures to promote different forms of direct democracy in Spain. From local to national level, new ways to call direct referendums and votes are put into action to truly represent the people’s will, not the will of some obscenely wealthy lobbyists or uncaring career politicians. These new direct democracy advancements will help in the future introduction of  more democratic economic models as well."
SPR_Set_the_Peninsula_Free_of_Castilian_Dominance:0 "Confront the Mastodon of State"
SPR_Set_the_Peninsula_Free_of_Castilian_Dominance_desc:0 "Iberism, the idea of an united Iberian peninsula, are often associated with the nationalists and traditionalists of Spain, but for the anarchists, Iberism has often been the end goal as well. The Portuguese monarchy is tyrannical and has attempted to create an almost feudalist system within their nation, and it is clear that Portuguese people now yearn for freedom. As such, it is the duty of good Spaniards to liberate these poor souls and unite the peninsula as it was always meant to be, although far more federalized and equal than the ideas of Castilian imperialists were."
SPR_Liberate_the_Minds_of_the_People:0 "No Monopolies on Knowledge"
SPR_Liberate_the_Minds_of_the_People_desc:0 "CNT-FAI has, for decades, promoted various forms of low-level education and enlightenment programs for the workers. In different clubs, Spanish proletarians and peasants learned both basic skills, such as reading and writing, as well as less conventional but equally important things, such as cultural and ideological teachings. Given the woeful state of Spain’s school system, destroyed by the influence of church on it as well as the serious underfunding by the reactionaries during the last two decades, these adult programs could help us uplift the Spaniards from their intellectual poverty into a new era of rationalism, cultural revival and ideological fortitude."
SPR_Cremate_the_Catholic_Church:0 "Eliminate the Ogres and Knights of Coupon"
SPR_Cremate_the_Catholic_Church_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has spread its tendrils into every aspect of Spanish life, and for very long, they dominated the minds of the Spanish people through education and fear, with the Inquisition terrorizing anyone who would not adhere to the ridiculous delusions of the church. Republicans had a shot at finally cremating the enemy of the people, but the ineffectiveness of their rule made it impossible for them to achieve. We cannot make the same mistake."
SPR_Communalize_Every_Aspect_of_Spanish_Life:0 "Communalize Every Aspect of Spanish Life"
SPR_Communalize_Every_Aspect_of_Spanish_Life_desc:0 "While we must nominally adhere to the system in place, there are ways to push Spain towards a direction free of statism and capitalism. We can support the creation of worker’s communes and peasant co-operatives, that will allow them to organize better and abandon the lashes of their bosses to benefit from the fruits of their labours fully. After all, right after the CNT-FAI was allowed to operate in 1936, they proved that the establishment of these styles of communes yielded great results. Thus, the creation and expansion of this system will get our full support, as long as the communes do not serve as havens for extremists and terrorists who would compromise our rule."
SPR_Break_Down_the_Gender_Divide:0 "Court the Free Women"
SPR_Break_Down_the_Gender_Divide_desc:0 "The anarchists of Spain made a crucial mistake in not supporting the cause of women’s emancipation, and this led to them missing out on the support of CNT-FAI’s women’s section, Mujeres Libres, during many events in the past. We could utilize this failure to our advantage and fully support the equal rights of women as truly free citizens of Spain. Not only will this earn us international support, it will hopefully allow us to integrate, or at least collaborate with, the Mujeres Libres, which can give a considerable boost to our party size and popularity. Besides, such an endorsement will only upset the traditionalists, and their opinion does not influence us one bit."
SPR_Ceasefire_With_the_King:0 "Repatriate the Golden Rabble"
SPR_Ceasefire_With_the_King_desc:0 "Cooperation between a monarch and a syndicalist party might appear to be completely impossible, the monarchy is willing to make concessions to almost anyone if it means the continuation of their rule over Spain, given how precarious their situation was in 1937. We may want to eventually get rid of the king in the future, but for now, the continued presence of the monarchy may very well be the one thing keeping the reactionaries from rising up, and for that fact alone, we must establish a cease-fire with the king for the time being."
SPR_Achieving_the_Impossible:0 "From the Utopian Thirty to All of Spain!"
SPR_Achieving_the_Impossible_desc:0 "The enigma of possibilist libertarianism has been solved, given our success in leading Spain towards a radically different future. It was us who saved Spain from falling apart in the mid-1930s, and it has been us again who will push Spain towards a brighter future, as an alternate path between revolutionary terrorism and capitalist or reactionary oppression."

SPR_Pragmatic_Pacifism_desc:0 "The world is burning as reactionaries and revolutionaries duke it out for supremacy.

sprd.1181.t:0 "The Fate of the Kingdom"
sprd.1181.d:0 "Kingdom of Spain today stands at a precipice. The rule of the Bourbon dynasty headed by Alfonso XIII is despised, a mere shadow of its former glory, and while Acción Popular’s four-year government has attempted to stem the tide of radicalism, it’s unpopularity is very clear. Republicans, socialists, anarchists, Carlists and other forces all gather to seek ways in which to topple the monarchy and AP’s government, and without drastic, unpopular and very uncharacteristic moves by the government, Spain may very well face another civil war, one potentially even more destructive than the slew of Carlist wars the nation had to endure in the last century.\n\nOn the Carlist side, radical firebrand leader of the Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista, youth wing of the movement, Manuel Fal Conde, has been amassing support to dislodge the current leader of Comunión Tradicionalista, Count of Rodezno. Many of Fal Conde’s supporters call for an open revolt against the state, a declaration of yet another Carlist war and a march from the Carlist heartland in the north to tear down the Madrid regime stone by stone until the rightful king sits atop his throne. On the other extreme of the Spanish politics sit Buanaventura Durruti, the folk hero of the anarchists who has waged a quiet war against the Spanish state for decades. His followers in the group Nosotros, based off Barcelona, want no moderation to the CNT-FAI idealism, with only the utter destruction of the monarchy and Spanish state enough to satisfy them. There is still time to reverse this rapid spiral towards civil war, if Acción Popular is capable of putting behind its stubbornness to work alone, but without massive compromises and difficult alliances, Spain will see yet another brother war.\n\nOne most likely far more destructive than anything the nation has seen before thanks to the rapid advances in military technology. As such, the people of Spain must decide whether they support the much-reviled Acción Popular government and their puppet king Alfonso XIII, or whether they would rather see the regime torn down and replaced with something new, be it the Carlist return to feudalism and old ways or the socialist dreams of a popular Spain"

sprd.1182.t:0 "Difficult Alliances"
sprd.1182.d:0 "The Spanish situation has escalated beyond any measure, and if the government of Acción Popular seeks to avoid the beginning of actual country-wide armed hostilities, then Gil-Robles and his allies must act fast in forming a wide coalition to see Spain saved from the fall. However, in the years between the fall of the republic in 1932 and the current day, Acción Popular has been very aggressive in pushing its rivals out of politics, and many republicans have seen it best to seek exile abroad. Socialists, syndicalists and some republicans still remain in France, mostly underground, but while strike action and even socialist unions have been banned for quite some time now, many union leaders still resist the government’s rule in less open ways. On the right, Carlists are a clear threat to the regime given their hatred for the government, but they have been slowly gathering allies within Spain’s right as well, from the radicals of Acción Española and Partido Nacionalista Español to even some moderate regionalist-minded agrarian conservatives. \n\nHowever, while both the extreme of syndicalist and Carlist wings absolutely despise the government and would never openly bargain with it, there are more moderate groups even within the anarchists and Carlists who could possibly be swayed to join the front towards stabilizing Spain. The Carlist titan Count of Rodezno has long been the leading man aiming for the unification of the two dynastic branches, and while the life-long Carlist politician lost much of his goodwill towards the Alfonsists following the aftermath of Sanjurjada, there is a possibility that he could be swayed to the side of Acción Popular if enough concessions toward the right were taken.\n\nAnother option would simply be to align the different nationalist groups who have been courted by the Carlists, so they will lack the needed support to carry out a true rebellion. Similar situation applies to the Spanish left, that is largely divided over the matter of insurrection. The revolution in Asturias during the autumn of 1934 was a massive blow to Spanish revolutionaries, and dissuaded many from revolutionary action unless pushed to it by their more aggressive peers. If AP can exploit this divide within the ranks of CNT-FAI and PSOE, especially through the leader of the moderate anarchists, Ángel Pestaña Nuñez, then Spain may have the chance to finally see the threat of civil war dissipate. However, there is always the option that Acción Popular chooses to forgo any concessions towards the left or right and attempts instead to form a coalition of centrist parties and malleable republicans towards the cause of saving Spain, though the success rate of such an endeavour appears slim."

sprd.1197.t:0 "The Greatest Republican Compromise"
sprd.1197.d:0 "With both Niceto Alcala-Zamora and Diego Martinez-Barrio convinced of Acción Popular’s noble intentions to save Spain, there is only one major republican party operating in exile that could be invited to the negotiations table. Izquierda Republicana, previously known as Acción Republicana, was one of the key organizers of the Pact of San Sebastian, the alliance of different republican and regionalist forces that would set forth the conspiracy to topple the monarchy in 1931. Led by the republican firebrand Manuel Azaña, the party has been a thorn in the side of Spanish kingdom, organizing regionalist resistance, funding republican groups and promoting the republican cause overseas, especially in the United States and Internationale.\n\nThe party is largely made up of left-wing liberals, progressives and some social democrats, and while it is very much a bourgeois and academian party in most regards, its alliances with the socialists and moderate syndicalists have allowed it to leverage its influence far beyond what the party’s small size would otherwise be capable of. As such, the only real option for Acción Popular would appear to be forming an alliance with Azañistas, but this would cause an uproar among the Spain’s Catholics as Azaña is seen as the manifestation of the devil due to his various secular positions and disregard for the safety of church officials. However, there is another option. Alejandro Lerroux’s radicals are a prominent local party, and while their influence waned during the aftermath of the Sanjurjada coup, they were not driven to exile unlike many other republicans due to the friendship Lerroux has with general Sanjurjo.\n\nMost expected Lerroux’s party to die off in the new authoritarian Spain, but Acción Popular found it more convenient to simply maintain the status quo and allow Partido Radical to exist, as they counteracted the influence of Catalan nationalists to a degree. However, in recent years it would appear that Lerroux has returned to some of his populist strategies from the past, and Partido Radical is rapidly growing as a protest against AP’s policies. An alliance with the establishment may thus not sound like a good deal for the Lerrouxists on paper, but given the immense corruption PRR suffers from, they could be bought to bolster AP’s battlelines, especially since many within the party’s rank share Gil-Robles’ fear of an anarchist or Catalan uprising."

sprd.1197.b:0 "Lerroux's PRR is the more reliable choice."

sprd.1206.t:0 "To Write the Kingdom's Eulogy"
sprd.1206.d:0 "The time for the Bourbon monarchy and the government of Gil-Robles has come to an end. New Spain must rise from the ashes of their failure, and the only ones capable of carrying such a victory to the end are the Carlists and the resurrected Popular Front, largely led by the syndicalists of CNT and supported by their allies in JONS, PSOE and BOC. The wide coalition of left-wing forces wants to overthrow the Madrid government once and for all, and replace it with a popular, democratic and truly revolutionary front that would see the failures of the republic and the stagnation of the monarchy rectified. \n\nThe Carlists, on their part, want to see the true king from the legitimist branch of Spanish monarchs restored, no matter which of the preferred candidates, regent Javier de Bourbon-Parma or Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena y de Borbón wins the power struggle for the movements support. Their idealized Spain is one with a grand return to imperial traditions, rapid decentralization of power to near feudal levels and extreme adherence to the Catholic religion, with a strong monarch and return to a truly representative Cortes. Either side has the means to attract mass following from the people of Spain, but in the case of an open revolt against the Alfonsine monarchy, one is more likely to gain the support of Spain’s people. For now, it is up to fate whether the anarchists or Carlists are more convincing to the many dissidents yearning to see the yellow and red flag taken down for good."

The Spanish political situation is dire and even the smallest fuse could set off a chain reaction that ends in disaster. It is up to Acción Popular, who are a big part of the reason for the mess in the first place, to come in and save the day. Yet, with a big part of Spaniards apathetic or hostile to any action they may take, Acción Popular may be damned if they do and damned if they don’t. This is a pivotal moment in Spanish politics. A crisis that may define the trajectory of the nation for decades to come, and one that the people of Spain have as much of a say in through their actions as the government has through its policies. Spain arrives at its moment of truth once more."

The governing ministers commanded by prime minister Gil-Robles must swiftly review their options and choose on the best course going forward, whether this is making great concessions to the republicans, allying with the disunited but relatively ideologically homogenous Spanish right or simply attempting to power on through with the support of minor conservative groups and the central structure of the party itself."

The leftists, while a threat to our regime, are very popular amongst the common people and the intelligentsia, and may give us the strength to stave off the impending disaster. We must put our ideological differences aside to work towards saving Spain, even if we’ll have to work on the fine print of the arrangement later on."

Thus, we must extend an olive branch to them as a gesture of goodwill. The Unión General de Trabajadores, which was banned after the Sanjurjada, must be restored to legal status to assure us of their loyalty and our commitment to working together in good faith. This will likely promote a more collaborationist strategy within PSOE over UGT’s Largo Caballero and his revolutionary line."

Conservatism and socialism, but most importantly, Catholic faith and militant atheism, aren’t compatible ideologies. And yet, it must be done to ensure our future.

IR is the party of Manuel Azaña y Díaz, a republican titan who could garner us the support of other republican parties and their supporters. On the other hand, PRR is the party of Alejandro Lerroux, who isn’t thought of as fondly inside republican circles due to their rampant corruption and lack of ideological commitment, but could afford us very valuable connections to some key figures behind the shadow. We must choose the lesser evil."

While a very controversial figure and the main cause of the mess we find ourselves in, he is nevertheless a very influential person who may just be the shot in the arm we need to pull through. Sanjurjo’s decision to hand out the reins of government to civilians in 1932 should also make people less likely to see this as an invitation for a military takeover, and Sanjurjo’s endorsement should make most of the military fall in line as well."

However, if there is one thing that we can salvage from the republicans, it is the ideology of Regenerationism, which allows us to objectively and scientifically observe and analyze the failures of Spanish society in recent memory without falling for the same follies our restorationist and republican predecessors fell for, which doomed Spain into a self-destructive cycle.

By reaffirming our commitment to our Christian values and to defending the church against such acts, we shall garner allies within the church itself, and while the most ardent conservatives may still oppose parts of our platform, we hope that the church’s support both monetarily and politically will provide a big boost to our platform among the more moderate believers."
SPR_Popular_Nationalism:0 "Muster Monarchist Might"
SPR_Popular_Nationalism_desc:0 "While Carlists and Alfonsists are natural enemies because of the fact their dynastic claims do not allow them to coexist, there is one very simple thing they both share in common: monarchism. For as much as we may have spent close to half a century warring against each other, republicans have failed to understand the simple fact that instituting a democracy is not entirely antithetical to having a monarch sit on the throne, as long as he is bound by a constitution. It is time we remind everyone that the House of Borbón is here to stay, and that both of its branches will work together to maintain the traditional order in Spain."

However, neither the government nor its new allies in the republicans have much love for these industrial tycoons, and to combat the collapse of Spain’s economic might, we must move against these industrial fat cats, such as the Catalan employers’ organization Foment del Treball Nacional and other similar groups aiming to keep Spain chained to the whims of big capital."
SPR_devalue_currency_center_loc_desc:0 "The value of Spanish peseta was slowly inching forwards as the backwards economy of Spain was also improving, but this slow growth was quickly smothered after the Black Monday. Inflation runs rampant and the peseta holds almost less value than the words of Spanish politicians in the eyes of our citizens. While it is a difficult and economically hard decision to make, we must devalue the peseta and stop the crash of the currency’s value, or at least slow it down"
SPR_devalue_currency_right_loc_desc:0 "With the collapse of German economy, we must revisit our stance on being tied to the Gold Standard. Spain does possess a good amount of gold left from our imperial times and other ventures, but it has been of little help in fighting the death spiral of the peseta.

However, there is a member of the party, who constantly causes trouble with these allies due to his push for a more equal Spain and frustrates the right-wing monarchists such as José Calvo Sotelo due to his preference for arguing his rather radical policy points through papal encyclicals. Manuel Giménez, known as the White Bolshevik, is a far cry from a socialist, but his policy points are often close to such figures as the Radical-Socialist leader Marcelino Domingo.

This proposed trade agreement would lower import and export costs of goods between Spain and our nation, as well as opening markets to the lucrative Spanish agricultural sector in exchange for the raw resources the New World can provide to the fledgling Spanish industrial sector.

Even German allies and members of the Mitteleuropa have turned to their national banks and even nations outside of their sphere of influence for futureproofing strategies, and the Kaiserreich must spend years, if not decades, to rebuild trust into German financing. With this in mind, Spain sits at the perfect place to become the new banking capital or Europe. It is true that our economy is no giant and it will take a long time for it to rival many of the nations of Mitteleuropa, but with the French and British financing giants gone and faith in Germany quickly eroding, we could offer a great solution to many nations looking to distance themselves from Berlin.\n\nThe Spanish gold reserves are hardly something to scoff at, with much of our old glory as the Conquistadors of South America still found within the vaults of Banco de España and other smaller regional banks such as Banco de Vizcaya, or the larger banking consortium Banco de Crédito Industrial. As such, our economy could gain a rather hefty boost from becoming the credit and loan capital of Europe, especially as the drums of war echo around the continent, and perhaps, with time, we could expand operations into Northern and Central Africa thanks to our colonial links there.\n\nSpain has been relatively influential in Latin American finance thanks to the connections forged during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship and even earlier, with some roots of cooperation going as far back as the colonial times. The new credit empire of Spain could thus serve as a bridge between the three continents, helping harbour business while lining the pockets of Spain’s bankers and financiers, and by extension, the government. Of course, this is likely to be costly, and becoming an open rival to the banks of Berlin and various other finance cities of Europe is not exactly a popular choice, but in times as dire as these, Spain must look after its own interests over being polite towards global powers."

The project, dating all the way back to 1929, was in itself the successor of a 1919 attempt to dam the Esla river, aimed at creating the largest reservoir of water in all of Europe. The dam, planned by Sociedad Hispano Portuguesa de Transportes Eléctricos, was a joint project between the states of Portugal and Spain, aimed at harvesting a whopping 100 MW of power from the river Esla. Through this immense power, the dam will directly supply much of Spain thanks to the immense strength of the waves, and provide much needed electric current to the rapidly modernizing north. The dam’s construction also led to the creation of a whole new village in the area, named Salto del Esla, which was built to house the masses of workers needed to finish such a massive endeavour.\n\nEven with the dam complete, many have decided to stick to the little village, finding work within the dam’s enormous complex or in the surrounding farmlands. The dam project was also notable for the involvement of local archaeologists, who participated in the mission to gate the river by helping move the local Visigothic temple, a great piece of Iberian history, into another location from the way of the dam construction. Due to the nature of the temple, this smaller cultural heritage protection mission had to be done stone by stone, but in the end, a valuable piece of Spain’s past was protected. With the dam complete, it is expected that in around a decade, the power output can grow by about thirty-three percent, well-suited for the needs of the growing northern industry."

sprd.1186.t:0 "An Unlikely Meeting?"
sprd.1186.d:0 "Early in the morning hours, right before the sunrise, a black car slid to a halt in front of an unassuming Madrid cafe. Normally, the place would’ve been closed for three hours more, but the two men in green uniforms betrayed this facade. The guards perked up into attention, squashing their cigarettes under heel as the car doors opened, letting three men out. The two biggest names in Spanish moderate unionism had appeared between the guards, with the notorious Catalan union boss Salvador Seguí standing out due to his large stature. He was flanked by Ángel Pestaña, the key ideologue of the paradoxical moderate anarchism, named treintismo by its followers, in Spain. These two had caused quite a few grey hairs to the Spanish government in the past, and Seguí still carried the scars from a particularly violent confrontation with strikebreakers during Catalonia’s great strikes of 1923, but today they had appeared here on a mission to save Spain. The guards waved them in and the two unionists entered the hazy cafe, greeted by the stone faced politicians of Accion Popular.\n\nThe famed Catholic firebrand José María Gil-Robles invited the men to the table, where a few more moderate members of the ruling party, such as the Catalan Christian democrat Luis Lucia Lucia and the agrarian reformer Manuel Giménez Fernández, were also seated. The moderates, increasingly more powerful within Accion Popular, had forced their El Jefe to take a more concessionary stance with the left, but couple years earlier no one would have believed if someone claimed that AP would enter talks with CNT-FAI. Yet it would appear that the very foundations of Spanish politics had gone topsy-turvy, and now the two sides so intent on seeing each other destroyed mere years earlier had to work together to not see the fragile house of cards collapse.\n\nThe sun had reached zenith before the two sides could reach an agreement, but after hours of bargaining, bickering and no small amount of shouting, Gil-Robles agreed to the demands of Pestaña, including temporarily stopping Guardia Civil actions against CNT-FAI and seeking to hold elections at the first possible opportunity. The unionists, on their part, would seek to pressure CNT-FAI to abstain from paramilitary violence, at least on those cases where it could be realistically achieved, but even the members of Accion Popular could see that there was nothing so convincing in this world to keep extremists like Buanaventura Durruti from continuing their anti-government actions. As the syndicalists exited the building, both sides could let out a breath of relief. Difficult days would be ahead, but it was a start, a start towards saving Spain from itself."
sprd.1186.a:0 "Dire times make for strange bedfellows"

sprd.1187.t:0 "The Working Man Answers"
sprd.1187.d:0 "Acción Popular has, since its ascension to lead Spain in 1932, served as the vanguard of anti-syndicalism in Spain. While there are a few more liberally-minded men within the party who do not wish for the measures we took in Asturias and in other parts of Spain following left-wing unrest, most of the party supported Gil-Robles’ use of Guardia Civil and Spanish army in breaking up strikes and uprisings in a swift and ruthless manner. With this in mind, many expect that even if AP is to offer a hand to the left-wing unionists for the sake of peace, there will be hardly anyone to answer it. Or this was the prevailing opinion prior to today, when news arrived from the representatives of the opposition unionists within CNT-FAI and the moderate wing of PSOE that they would be willing to open dialogue with the government in order to reach a compromise for the sake of peace. The power of these moderates especially within the anarchists is obviously limited, as the leader of these ‘treintists’ Ángel Pestaña has always been a controversial figure within CNT-FAI, but as more and more republicans turn to join forces within the coalition for peace, the possibilists have seemingly gained the upper hand within CNT-FAI. Few expected such a turn of events, but the anarchists seem just as tired of fighting as AP is, and while firebrands like the Ascaso brothers and Buanaventura Durruti will continue to fight till they either perish or their red and black banner flies over Madrid, we now have far stronger position to negotiate from with rest of the syndicalists. With this alliance secured, we may finally start the process towards true peace."
sprd.1187.a:0 "Wonderful!"

sprd.1188.t:0 "The Banner of Labor Stays Pointed Away From Us."
sprd.1188.d:0 "It would appear that despite the strong gains Acción Popular have made with convincing the republicans of their noble intentions, the anarchists and syndicalists remain unconvinced. This is hardly a surprise, given the harsh reprisals AP allowed the military and Guardia Civil carry against anarchists and syndicalists during the Asturias rising and other battles against CNT-FAI. Gil-Robles and the moderates within AP had banked on the influence of the moderate anarchist leader Ángel Pestaña had within CNT-FAI, but it would appear that either he was incapable of convincing his comrades or abandoned collaboration out of spite. Nonetheless, the reality of the matter now is that we must continue with the allies we managed to scrounge up for now, and hope that it is enough to maintain stability in Spain. Even if CNT-FAI doesn’t outright join us, those few hopeful members left among AP’s moderates wish that the efforts of Pestaña at least caused the anarchists to become more of a bystander to our tussle with the Carlists, rather than an outright participant. Many others, including Gil-Robles, hold no such hopes, seeing the anarchists as an enemy until proven otherwise."
sprd.1188.a:0 "We never needed them anyway... right?"

sprd.13.t:0 "Our Approach"
sprd.13.d:0 "Given the success of our negotiations thus far with CNT-FAI’s opposition leaders, Acción Popular and the ‘peace coalition’ is now in a position to demand something in return from the unionists in exchange for the promises made by AP’s leadership, those being the dissolution of the authoritarian regime, reintroduction of parliamentary and municipal elections, legalization of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo union and most importantly, the abdication of King Alfonso in favour of one of his sons. Originally the demands was the complete dismantling of the monarchy and return to the democratic republican model of 1931, but this was obviously unacceptable for even the most moderate members of AP. Thankfully, after a great deal of negotiations and bargaining, the monarchy question was sidelined for now.\n\nIn exchange for these concessions and promises, CNT agreed to adopt a more moderate line and focus on unionist action instead of the revolutionary line espoused by members of the radical FAI wing. Given that we have a mutual enemy in the Carlists, they have also provided support against the paramilitaries of the traditionalists and radical Catholic unionists, Sindicatos Libres, which serve as a strikebreakers and at times, terrorist wing of the Carlists. Some hardliners, who opposed the deal before we even opened negotiations with Pestaña and Seguí, now call that AP should demand more from the anarchists.\n\nConservative firebrands such as Luis García Guijarro have demanded that if CNT wishes to engage within the new kingdom’s institutions, it must purify itself from syndicalist rot. More moderate members instead claim that we should back up Pestaña in his plans to form a new syndicalist party for parliamentary representation, as was the original point within the Manifesto of the Thirty, where Pestaña denounced the way FAI tangled the CNT union into dirty politics. While it may seem counter-intuitive for AP to invite their perhaps greatest rivals to contest them in elections, on the other hand it makes perfect sense. If CNT is no longer the primary organ of syndicalist politics, it may transform into a more regular union and moderate its course more. However, we could simply take what we have already won at the negotiations table, and trust that CNT-FAI will follow through on their promises, for demanding more could lead to a break in the fragile status quo."

sprd.1189.t:0 "Wrath of the Red Banner"
sprd.1189.d:0 "The demand we levied at the anarchists may have been a mistake, as now the representatives of the moderate wing have stormed out of the meeting, led by Ángel Pestaña, who claimed that this was nothing more than a ploy to discredit the possibilists within CNT-FAI. The non-collaborationist wing of Acción Popular was quick to slam their more moderate colleagues, using the incident as yet another example of there being no possibility for a peaceful cooperation between the ‘Two Spains’, and that only through continued campaign of rooting out syndicalism can Spain be saved from its more impulsive and dangerous citizens. With CNT-FAI negotiations out of the picture, many fear that we may now lose support among the other republicans too, and it is clear that there may not be a possibility for a peaceful resolution in the horizon for the time being."
sprd.1189.a:0 "Once an anarchist, always an anarchist."

sprd.1190.t:0 "The PSOE Walks Out!"
sprd.1190.d:0 "Following CNT-FAI’s denouncement of the government and peace coalition, leadership of PSOE has renounced their part in the wider movement, claiming that AP is merely showing its true colours now, and wants to rule as the second coming of Primo de Rivera. These news have been met with joyous celebration by the radicals of UGT, who, led by Largo Caballero, never supported such peace talks in the first place. PSOE was never as big of a troublemaker as CNT-FAI, but losing them from the coalition is bound to cause issue further down the line, as the battle-lines begin to form between the peace coalition, Carlists and syndicalist-socialist working man’s coalition. Perhaps the situation can still be salvaged, but for now, things look dire for AP’s peace efforts."
sprd.1190.a:0 "Another loss? Just great..."

sprd.1203.t:0 "A Fragile Ceasefire"
sprd.1203.d:0 "The road to this final hurdle has been a long one, with many difficult negotiations between Spain’s right-wing parties, old rivals of Acción Popular and reluctant allies at a time of strife. But thanks to the wide coalition the party has forged, Spain now has the first shot at true political unity since the fall of the monarchy. Ex-Carlists with ties to the dynastic line’s supporters, such as Luis Lucia Lucia have made few cautionary probes towards well-known Carlist moderates, and while they’ve been met with suspicion and hostility of course, there have been some perceived breakthroughs as well.\n\nThe Carlist cause is rather divided between the moderates of Tomás Domínguez Arévalo, the sixth Count of Rodezno, and the so called Cruzadistas faction, led primarily by younger guard of Carlism such as Jesús de Cora y Lira and Manuel Fal Conde. The Rodeznistas are obviously still very sore about the perceived betrayal by Acción Popular following the 1932 coup, when, despite previous agreements to restore Juan de Bourbon as the king of Spain, Alfonso XIII was proclaimed the king of Spain again. However, they view the threat of syndicalism as one that overcomes any dynastic issues, especially with the powerful French Commune looming over the Pyrenees, and are open to negotiating a cease-fire, at least until the current crisis is solved.\n\nAfter that, the Carlists expect king Alfonso to step down and finally honour the Pact of Territet, first established in 1932 with the aim of monarchist unity under Juan de Bourbon, and they also demand that no matter the eventual form the new Spanish monarchist government takes, there must be a restoration of the fueros, traditional autonomy rights of Spain’s regions, or the Carlists will turn away from our side. However, it would seem that the split in the Carlist Communion is not one that can just be ignored, and the Cruzadistas have protested Rodezno’s moderate stances with fiery speeches and large demonstrations. If the moderates do not have the strength to silence their more radical allies, there can be no hope of ever finding a common ground between the Carlists and Alfonsists."
sprd.1203.a:0 "Let us hope for the best and prepare for the worst"

sprd.1204.t:0 "The Dynastic Schism Reinforced"
sprd.1204.d:0 "It would appear that the worst fears of Acción Popular’s leadership have come to pass. The alliance made up of radical Carlists, from the fanatical Núcleo de la Lealtad to the youthful and even revolutionary supporters of Manuel Fal Conde, the Carlist student’s section Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista, has managed to seize power, dislodging Count of Rodezno from his seat as the incumbent leader of the cause of Carlos. With these radicals in control, there can be no expectation of the two dynastic branches of Spain making peace over a shared support of Juan de Bourbon, for these radicals support only the direct descendant of Carlos V. This man happens to be Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena y de Borbón through his mother Blanca, and he is known for his uncompromising stance towards reunification, especially with the support of the more radical wing of Carlism to back his ideals.\n\nHowever, everything is not yet lost, for the alliances forged by Acción Popular during the difficult last few months may very well come to protect us against these troublemakers. While Fal Conde and Jesús de Cora y Lira nominally control the movement, their hold on it is feeble, and many view them as little more than hoodlums wearing the time-honoured traditional beret of Carlism. As such, while the Traditionalist Communion itself may not link its shields with ours against the shared threat of syndicalism, many individual Carlists are likely to leave the movement to support ours instead for the good of Spain. It is also clear that the alliances of Acción Popular makes the situation of a Carlist uprising less likely now, given that they lack the many more moderate allies the movement would have needed to actually pull of a military takeover of Spain."
sprd.1204.a:0 "Their loss, we are ready for them now."

sprd.1205.t:0 "The Unholy Alliance"
sprd.1205.d:0 "In a series of news that shocked Spain, the Carlist movement has converged earlier today and come to a decision. The incumbent leader of Comunión Tradicionalista, Count of Rodezno, has emerged victorious in the movement’s internal battles, and the more radical and uncompromising faction of Carlists led by Manuel Fal Conde and Jesús de Cora y Lira has been forced to lick its wounds after a decisive success of their rivals. Count of Rodezno has honoured the negotiations between Acción Popular and Comunión Tradicionalista held earlier, and the Carlist movement has announced its support for the government, for the good of all Spain against the godless forces of syndicalism, anarchism and communism.\n\nWith the entire might of Spain’s conservative and traditionalist right behind us, the radicals of CNT-FAI nor the Carlist insurgents of Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista will not possess the might to defeat us on the field of battle. The nationalists of Spain are assembled, and all that awaits us now is the final struggle for control, to finish off the embers of rebellion that glow all around Spain, just waiting for a gust to again set them alight. Preparations are underway to integrate the Carlist militias, Requetés, into the military organization, so they can better help us crush the anarchist rabble of Buanaventura Durruti and the few remaining cells of revolutionary socialists. It remains unknown whether the Carlists will truly honour their commitment to the son of Alfonso XIII after this current crisis is over, but for now, all of Spain watches with bated breath as the schismatics unite once more."

# Reach Out to Germany Event #

sprd.1200.t:0 "Madrid Calls For Aid!"
sprd.1200.d:0 "The Spanish Kingdom and its conservative government has reached out towards Berlin earlier today. The government of the Acción Popular party, put into place partially thanks to Germany’s support in 1932, has been struggling to contain the spiral towards collapse that the Spanish state has been fighting against since the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. However, now it seems that this situation is growing more untenable by the day, with radicals from both the Carlist youth organization Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista and from the anarchist radical wing of Federación Anarquista Ibérica seeking to dismantle the kingdom and replace it with their own new order.\n\nMany within AP look for inspiration in the Kaiserreich, and some have even pushed for the adoption of the Prussian constitutional structure in Spain, but this has thus far gone nowhere due to the issues Spain faces in so many fields. Prominent Germanophile and member of AP, Ramón Serrano Súñer, has arrived in Berlin to negotiate with the Kaiser’s government for aid to the Spanish cause for stability, primarily through economic and political support. Such an ask would of course increase Germany’s importance in the foreign policy of Spain, and given that the Germans backed the regime once before, it is only logical to support them once more. However, some within the German government see this as a waste of time and valuable resources needed to restart the Kaiserreich’s economy. They view the troubles in Spain as a direct result of Acción Popular’s poor handling of the state, and a matter that Spain must rectify on its own."
sprd.1200.a:0 "We have no reason to refuse."
sprd.1200.b:0 "They dug that hole themselves, better dig themselves out of it too"

sprd.1201.t:0 "Berlin Agrees!"
sprd.1201.d:0 "It would appear that the government of the Kaiserreich sympathises with the cause of Acción Popular and has promised to send some economic support as well as political endorsement of the Madrid government. While this won’t stop the radicals from ruining Spain if we simply rest on our laurels, it does give us some time to retaliate against the wolves circling around the wounded Kingdom of Spain."
sprd.1201.a:0 "Finally, some breathing space"

sprd.1202.t:0 "The Kaiser's Rejection"
sprd.1202.d:0 "It would appear that the government of the Kaiserreich has little love for the regime of Acción Popular, and they have rejected our call for aid, citing that the issue is Spain’s own to handle and the Kaiserreich cannot waste valuable resources to prop up a dying regime. This is hardly welcome news in Madrid, and such an insult will most definitely be remembered if Spain manages to survive the crisis."

The government of Acción Popular has been forced to take increasingly drastic measures to fight the continuing death spiral occuring in Spain, and these alliances have not come without a considerable deal of compromises and tough decisions. Each concession has come at a price, that being the popularity of Acción Popular, and many think that the party may never recover from its precarious situation. Leadership of José Maria Gil-Robles has come under intense fire from many within the party, especially those subscribing "
sprd.21.a:0 "We must explore our options"

sprd.22.t:0 "To Finish Off the Radicals for Good"
sprd.22.d:0 "The last few months have been far from easy, as Acción Popular has had to use every bit of political capital it has among Spain’s many political factions in order to keep the leaking ship of Spanish monarchy afloat. Bargaining, pleading, coercing and blackmailing has brought us here, to this point, where the party is finally at a point to strike at the anarchist hardliners led by Buanaventura Durruti, the Nosotros group, and the Carlist youth wing Agrupación de Estudiantes Tradicionalistas, led by Manuel Fal Conde and Jaime del Burgo. These two groups are central for the defeat of the radicals in Spain, as while they may not hold enough manpower, political capital or firepower to topple the Spanish kingdom alone, they do have the means to galvanize their respective sides to action and cause a massive amount of societal turmoil, even leading to a point where we cannot avoid Spain falling into uprisings and even a full-blown civil war.\n\nAP and its leadership must now decide how to approach the situation. The loyalty of Guardia Civil and the army is not the question, as the government has the endorsement of general Sanjurjo, but to ensure total victory, AP could pull in favours from its allies and seek to further damage the reputation of the radicals, for it is clear that AP cannot deal with Nosotros or AET peacefully. At the very least, informing AP’s allies of the party’s intentions would help them prepare for the inevitable clash with radicals.\n\nHowever, others within the party claim that this is too risky, for these allies could simply be wolves in sheep’s clothing, leaking these plans to the radicals and allowing them to slip away unnoticed or fully contest our rule. Some even go as far as to claim that there is nothing to worry about, for the radicals have already been abandoned by their own, the Traditionalist Communion and CNT-FAI, so this move would simply consolidate AP’s hold over Spain."

sprd.23.t:0 "The Smoke Clears"
sprd.23.d:0 "It would appear that our strategy worked! The anarchist extremists and Carlist terrorists were swiftly struck in a coordinated attack led by known loyalists such as general Mola and police chief Mauricio Carlavilla, whose swift and brutal surgical strikes left the radicals reeling. All around Spain, trucks, cars and motorcycles rushed through the streets and large groups of Guardia Civil, Carabineros and Cuerpo de Vigilancia intercepted units of anarchists and Carlists, often catching them off guard to the point that they surrendered.\n\nElsewhere, these fanatics fought like cornered rats, being flushed out of their hideouts with grenades, some slain in running battles with mobile police forces as well. Many escaped and went into hiding, regrettably including both movements’ leaders Manuel Fal Conde and Buanaventura Durruti, but given the destruction of rebel hideouts, loss of large quantities of equipment and most importantly, the death or imprisonment of many experienced fighters from both organizations. With these radicals crushed, our position in Spain is finally strong enough to possibly open dialogue with our allies and seek a compromise for the good of all Spain, though some fear that perhaps the threat is not quite dealt with yet…"

The government, paralyzed with indecision and infighting as the coalition slowly unraveled before the eyes of the people of Spain, has been unable to combat the effects of Black Monday and the on-going societal breakdown to the best of its abilities, and now, the radicals have been able to gain enough momentum for a full-blown revolt. As militias form and military leaders flock to the ranks of the extremists, the citizens of Spain begin to lose what shreds of hope they had held for recovery, and the clouds of civil war gather over the nation. The Acción Popular government under José María Gil-Robles will always be remembered for this lack of fortitude as the knives are drawn and Spain descends into an anarchic feast of death."

sprd.26.t:0 "The Radicals Blink First"
sprd.26.d:0 "Despite the worries brought up by some members of Acción Popular, the crisis seems to have come to an end. The radical firebrands who came so close to toppling the monarchy in Spain and pushing Spain into the depths of a horrific civil war have led the nation. The anarchists of Nosotros, leaving the ranks of more moderate CNT-FAI councils, have fled over the border to France, with many being intercepted still but an unknown number making it through despite the vigilance of law enforcement.\n\nThe Carlist extremists seem to have fled to Portugal and the colonies, hiding among locals to avoid detection and to seek asylum in the cities and towns of Algiers. For a moment, all of Spain watched with bated breath whether the more moderate members of these groups would attempt to intervene, but it would appear that they have instead chosen to bide their time, seeing that the military is quite ready to crush any insurrection or uprising at a moment’s notice. It would appear that all the hard work, all the compromises and gambles made by Gil-Robles and his subordinates have paid off, and Spain is now ready to heal from the scars of the past."
sprd.26.a:0 "It worked?"

sprd.34.t:0 "The Impossible Miracle"
sprd.34.d:0 "Despite the readiness of the Spanish military and police forces, and the increased clashes on the streets between the government and protestors, it would appear that things are slowly dying down in the nation. The tumultuous period that has largely lasted since the collapse of the republic and installation of an authoritarian regime is seemingly finally coming to an end, people having renewed their faith in the system or at the very least, gained a small degree of optimism towards it. Exiled republicans are returning en masse, areas damaged by the fighting against radicals are being rebuilt and international investors are seemingly eyeing up the Spanish markets once more.\n\nHowever, despite the bustling conversations, reopening of numerous cultural movements throughout Spain, the reactivation of Spanish political life and most importantly, the seeming return to normalcy after such a long period of chaos, people are waiting for something. There is a prominent anticipation for announcement on behalf of Acción Popular, the people of Spain await what the future holds now that the storm clouds have seemingly passed. Nobody, not even AP, wants a return to the authoritarian limbo that was the period between 1932 and today, and it is doubtful if such a continuation would even be possible without yet another spiral to chaos or military intervention.\n\nYet many are also doubtful that AP will restore the elections in Spain, even with Alfonso gone, as the party is known to harbour many anti-democratic currents. The coming months will be long and precarious ones as the government maneuvers many pitfalls of governance for the sake of Spain, but for the time being, Spain enters a lull in the chaos. Whether it’s an eye of the storm giving false hope to the beleaguered people of Iberia or the final moments before the passing of as stormfront, nobody knows. But for a moment, the Spanish spirits have been soothed."

sprd.101.desc:0 "After the sudden end to the second Spanish republic and the formation of the royal dictatorship under Alfonso XIII and general Sanjurjo, Spain has only seen the contested "mandate" election between the Carlists, the anarchists of CNT-FAI and the Accion Popular, king's puppeteers. Now that Spain has finally entered the 20th century and left behind the abhorrent relic of the past that was the previous regime, new elections have been organized to properly represent the will of the people. Dozens of parties, both regional and country-wide, will take part, though in truth only six are likely to win the elections. On the left, the reorganized PSOE socialists, united under the moderate socialist Julian Besteiro, run on a platform of heavy-handed labour reforms, redistribution of land to those that work it, and deepening of trade and diplomacy with the Third Internationale.\n\nRepresenting the more centrist left-wingers is Manuel Azaña's Izquierda Española, moving further left thanks to an electoral alliance of various small socialist movements and regional parties. They represent the middle class but with sympathies to the workers too, and seek to bring about a just, equal Spain, where education and institutions are removed from church influence. To their right, representing left-leaning liberals, is Union Española led by Diego Martinez Barrio. While unlike to win, due to the influence of Azaña's party, the growing resentment towards Alejandro Lerroux's radicals could lead to their supporters turning towards the more traditionalist left-wing Radicals under Martinez Barrio.\n\nThe centre-rights are dominated by the two giants of the original republican movement, which have nonetheless taken very different routes. Known for their moderate stance on most matters, despite the name, the Radicals have sought to repair their reputation following the collapse of the authoritarian regime. Known for collaborating with the monarchists and even the Catholics despite their previous anti-clerical attitudes, Lerroux is not expected to win unless his party pulls of a miracle and manages to reinvent its image. This is not helped by the fact that the president of the Second Republic, Niceto Alcala-Zamora, and his Derecha Liberal party is increasingly popular after its leader returned from exile in Uruguay. Their party runs on a platform of liberal conservatism, secularism and respect for the regional minorities of Spain.\n\nFinally, the Accion Popular represents the most right-wing party, seeking to capitalize on the open defiance to Catholic church most other parties, supporting more traditional and even at times authoritarian currents in the Spanish society. Advocating for a society built on so called social Catholicism, large role of the king and church in society, extensive centralization of Spain especially in regards to the many minorities and resistance to socialists and republicans. Many view the party with suspicions give its role in the royal dictatorship, but its new leader José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones has agreed to respect the new monarch's wishes for democracy, though how credible these claims are remains to be seen."

The time has come to break their iron grip on Spain, the clarion calls ring across Spain and the working man shall answer!

Not only is the population there relatively pro-republican, the island chain also controls a large portion of the Mediterranean thanks to the mighty guns of its defensive fortresses. Given that the revolution is planned to begin in Barcelona, capturing the Balearics opens up immense possibilities to not only control aid coming in for the monarchists from Algiers or Italy, but to also secure the naval supply routes to Catalonia from France and Italy, lowering the need to transport everything in through rail or truck."
SPR_The_Popular_Front:0 "The Most Popular of Fronts"
SPR_The_Popular_Front_desc:0 "During the republican years, the Republican-Socialist coalition ruled from 1931 to the coup of 1932, and while this particular alliance was marred with indecision, differing viewpoints and quite a bit of social radicalisation, it did show that an alliance of left-wing forces is the only real way Spain can truly push against the bastions of reaction within Spanish society. Thus, as the left-wing republicans prepare for a revolution, the idea of a Popular Front, aligning every republican party from the socialists and communists of PSOE and BOC all the way to the conservative republicans of Partido Conservador and Derecha Liberal must come together so that the republic may be reborn. After the war, whatever differences various members of the alliance have will be dealt with through democratic elections, but for now, the triumph of republicanism is the most important aim of the Popular Front, and one that all parties are willing to set their differences aside to achieve."

However, even now, it is highly debatable whether an uprising of the republicans can ever succeed against the Madrid regime, given its control of the army, police and other state apparatuses. As such, if the revolution is to succeed, it must align the various smaller, but still regionally important, nationalist, regionalist and federalist movements scattered around Spain, such as the Galician Partido Galeguista, Catalan Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya and the Basque Acción Nacionalista Vasca. These groups align with many republicans ideologically, but it is clear that if they are to support us, there must be strong promises of regional autonomy and federalism towards these groups or they may end up siding with the Kingdom or the Carlist dissidents."

While the wider republican movement and the anarchists do not agree on many topics, the members of the Popular Front know that without the support of CNT-FAI, the largest union movement in most of Spain, the revolution will peter out within weeks. As such, many compromises and difficult decisions must be made to align this heterogenous force of anarchists and syndicalists, so that the cursed regime of Gil-Robles and the king Alfonso finally come to an end."

As such, if we are to succeed and overthrow the pretender regime in Madrid, we need allies.

Sindicatos Libres is not explicitly Carlist but the movement is closest to the traditionalists and many higher-ups of the union such as Juan Laguía Lliteras and Ramón Sales Amenós, are members of the Carlist communion. Many unionists are of questionable loyalty given that a lot of the members of Sindicatos Libres are direct converts from CNT-FAI who may even bounce between these two unions depending on how harshly the anarchists treat the church at any given time. Nonetheless, they are perhaps the best direct weapon the Carlists possess for contesting the power of the faistas and other unionists in Barcelona, and as we prepare to seize the mantle of the true monarchists of Spain, we must utilize their talents to the maximum."

To compound to this problem for AP, the leader of JAP, 	José María Valiente Soriano, has secretly joined the Carlist side.

While Carlists are hardly friends of the Basque and Catalan nationalists, who are growing more and more towards separatist directions by the day, there are other, more reliable partners. If we were to ally with the various Spanish conservative regionalists, the political reach and resources of Carlist cause would be exponentially increased. This will, of course, require concessions and promises of reform in the future, but for now, it is the best way to fortify the Carlist cause before we play our hand and actively rebel against the Alfonsists."

sprf.16.t:0 "The Fate of Andorra"
sprf.16.d:0 "The Principality of Andorra is a tiny relic from the feudal times of Iberia and France, and while de jure it has been part of France for centuries, de facto it was ruled as an independent, feudal fiefdom for quite some time. The French mostly participated in the ruling of the principality by appointing the current ruler of France, be it a king, president or Consul, as the co-prince of Andorra, with the Bishop of Urgell as the other co-prince. However, with the dire economic straits that Andorra found itself in during the early 20th century, and the rise of political Catalanism, Andorrans began to view themselves more and more as a sovereign nation, and demands for universal suffrage grew louder.\n\nWhen France fell to disarray and Spanish troops marched into Andorra, the co-prince system was technically taken over by the Spaniards but in reality the region was occupied by the forces of Madrid to combat the rise of Catalanism. Now that we have liberated Andorra from the grasp of the Spanish imperialists, the Paris government is obviously eager to fully control the tiny strip of land, but some of the moderates have recommended that we restore the principality to its original situation, in order to not have to deal with the unrest that an occupation would require. The region has resisted modernity for centuries, and while it would obviously be lucrative to shatter the chains to feudalism that Andorra still holds onto, it would also be quite graceful of us to let the small state maintain its matters in peace, and reach towards modernity at a pace the Andorrans desire."

sprc.1.t:0 "End of the Civil War"
sprc.1.d:0 "The terrible Spanish civil war, a conflict that will likely be remembered on the peninsula for centuries to come, has finally reached its final conclusion. The Kingdom, torn apart by the anarchists and Carlists in their mad bid for power, has finally been united by the power of the Spanish army’s might, but the victory is a bitter and hollow one. So many sons and daughters of Spain lay dead, killed by the bullets of their brothers and sisters in meaningless squabbles over whose ideology is right or wrong. The capital city of Madrid is little more than rubble, and the once bustling industrial heartlands of Bilbao and Catalonia are completely destroyed, destroyed by their final defenders under the Burgundian Cross’ last stand or the blood-stained banner of CNT-FAI.\n\nThe Kingdom, victors of the bloody war, are now left with the difficult task of reuniting the nation and healing the wounds of the past, but few expect this to be possible given the incredible devastation and suffering our nation has had to endure. Many blame the government of Acción Popular under José María Gil-Robles for causing the war, and the emergency government of José Sanjurjo for the many atrocities committed, and the monarchy of the house of Bourbon is forever stained with the blood of the dead. But from here, we must rebuild, if we can, for without any attempts, the blood spilt will be in vain."

sprc.7.t:0 "Tragedy's Curtain Call"
sprc.7.d:0 "Despite all the efforts that the Madrid government has attempted to use against the radical ideologues of AET and FAI, the looming crisis has escalated and civil war seems inevitable. Anarchists have mobilized all over Spain, and among them, more and more republicans and socialists take up arms in defiance to the regime of Alfonso XIII and Acción Popular. The Carlists have been training their army in secret for years now, and the Requeté forces are on the march, with clashes against Guardia Civil and police units reported all over Northern Spain. Entire military units have gone silent, army commanders have disappeared into the night and weapon shipments are missing all over Spain. Bombings, assassination attempts and street fights are a daily occurrence, and while our enemies have not yet raised their banners in open call for war, this is only a matter of time. The time for talks and compromises is over, the Kingdom must prepare to settle the crisis through fire and flame. Already, king Alfonso is planning to abdicate to buy a smidgeon of good will from the citizens of Spain, and the army is gearing itself to defend the strongholds of Madrid and Sevilla to the last man."
sprc.7.a:0 "Spain arrives to its moment of truth."

sprc.8.t:0 "Alfonso XIII Abdicates"
sprc.8.d:0 "In a final plea for stability, King Alfonso XIII, the restored monarch of Spain brought back to rule the nation in 1932, has abdicated. Reviled by most citizens of Spain and loved by few, Alfonso’s rule has been one of the most chaotic periods in Spanish history, and few expect the king to have many years left given his worsening health, if no assassin cuts him down before that. The government of Spain has proclaimed a regency until the crisis can be solved and one of the sons of Alfonso returned to the throne. However, there are fears that the military, unsatisfied with how the civilian government of Gil-Robles has run things thus far, will simply oust the government and install a temporary regime of generals, most likely headed by either the old guard led by Damaso Berenguer and Severiano Martinez Anido. However, the more likely situation would be a takeover of the younger officers, such as Manuel Goded, Emilio Mola and Juan Yagüe. To prevent such a situation, the government of Acción Popular could simply relinquish power and reach out to general José Sanjurjo y Sacanell, the man who originally installed the Gil-Robles government and supports the retaining of a constitutional monarchy. Sanjurjo’s authority among the army is unshakeable, and even the most radical officers generally fall in line when faced with the Lion of the Rif. As such, he could serve as a temporary head of state, directing a monarchist military cabinet capable of running the nation in a time of war. However, Gil-Robles could simply rely on the support of Sanjurjo and retain the civilian government until the war is over, though should the Kingdom start to struggle in its quest to defeat the accursed Carlists and anarchists, the military may very well sideline Sanjurjo and grab power for itself."
sprc.8.a:0 "We need a strong leader, invite Sanjurjo."
sprc.8.b:0 "We will not fall into the trap that is tyranny, keep the civilian government."

sprc.9.t:0 "Spain's Final Fall"
sprc.9.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened. The Spanish Kingdom, so long plagued by internal instability, anarchist agitation and separatist minorities, has fallen into a civil war. The accursed Carlists have proclaimed their rival government in the north, seizing the stronghold of traditionalism in Navarre and Basque Country. Their Requeté militias are marching further south and west towards Burgos and Galicia, and conservatives fed up with the governance of king Alfonso and Acción Popular have abandoned the Madrid government and fled to join the ranks of the Carlists, including many generals such as Varela and Rada Peral. In Catalonia and Valencia, anarchists of the CNT-FAI have acted as the tip of the spear for the Spanish republicans, and the rival government for the restoration of the Spanish Republic has openly been proclaimed. As anarchists, socialists and Carlist guerillas attack loyalists of the Madrid government on the streets of nearly all cities in Spain, the war has begun, and all of Spain will feel the wrath of modern weapons. From now on, brother shall slay brother, and only one side may emerge victorious to count the fallen and put an end to the lunacy."

sprd.2300.t:0 "The Question of Equatorial Guinea?"
sprd.2300.d:0 "With the battle raging on Spanish mainland, few officers or politicians have paid much heed to the African colonies, as the Spanish Legion and Regulares units in the Rif are ready to deal with any tribesmen foolish enough to attempt an insurrection. However, a long way down south in the land of Fangs, Gabon vipers and West African crocodiles, the situation is far from optimal. The Spanish colony of Equatorial Guinea has long been a forgotten backwater, and the local colonial garrison hardly numbers more than a few hundred men even at the best of times, but with the consolidation of most of Central Africa under the colossus of Mittelafrika, the worry of local governors has always been that the Germans would attempt to seize the colony. \n\nNow, these worries seem to have become a reality, as local military leader and surveyor Juan Fontán Lobé has reported that after the start of hostilities in Spain, German Askari troops have appeared near the Guinean border far more often than before, and there has even been a few incursions into Spanish territory. These may just be local probes aimed at testing the resolve of Spanish defenders in an hypothetical attack, but Fontán is not happy to leave anything to chance, and has requested additional men and materiel to fight off the sycophants of Dar-es-Salaam should they attempt anything. Still, given the dire situation on the mainland, it may be prudent to save up the troops and weapons to fight off the godforsaken Carlists and syndicalists here than to contest the German colonial behemoth"

German troops flooded across the border earlier this week, occupying the local Fang villages quickly and ruthlessly, and as the troops of local military commander Juan Fontán Lobé tried to contest this unlawful occupation of Spain’s rightful land, they were slaughtered to the last man. German colonial officers claim that the local tribes had attacked tribes on the German side of the border and the forces sent to the region were a mere peacekeeping contingent, and that the Spanish forces died in combat against the locals, but nobody would be foolish enough to believe such lies.\n\nWhen the decision to not reinforce the colony was made, it was thought that the Germans would likely leave the island of Fernando Po alone because of its small size, but after a German fleet blocked the local harbour and marines from Dar-es-Salaam stormed the beaches of the island, it became evidently clear that the Hun would not sate its hunger for conquest in the mainland alone. With the fall of Fernando Po, the last holdout of Spain in Central Africa is gone. This dire insult to the honour of Spain will not go unnoticed, and the martyrs of Equatorial Guinea shall be avenged once the terrible war wrecking Iberian mainland has been dealt with"

sprd.1.t:0 "[SPR.GetNameDefCap]"
sprd.1.d:0 "[SPR.GetNameDefCap]: Once the greatest of the Colonial Empires, she saw all of her remaining overseas colonies lost after a swift war against the USA in 1898. The conflict left a permanent mark on the Spanish population, the loss of what little had remained of their overseas empire. With the loss of their empire, Spain's populace has become deeply divided.\n\nAfter taking his place on the throne in 1902, King Alfonso XIII seemed keen on regaining Spain's former status as a colonial power by intervening in Morocco. The intervention lasted for a whole decade, and the outcome, while a victory, was not exactly in favour for Spain: Her Moroccan possessions remain a source of permanent unrest and her army was shown to be a remnant of the past. Spain turned in on herself afterwards, remaining neutral during the Weltkrieg, all while the populace's faith in King Alfonso faded and the king lost what little interest he had had in governance. With the King increasingly removed from political matters and a boiling population, Spain was looking ripe for an upheaval of incredible magnitude. A military coup performed by general Primo de Rivera did little to stabilize the situation, but it did place Spain into a limbo of political stagnation. \n\nAs a result of this stagnation and complacency, de Rivera was deposed after seven years of rule, and Spain would see a return to democracy the following year. After the General Elections of 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, and Alfonso, even more unpopular thanks to de Rivera’s rule, accepted the will of his people and went into exile. However, the Republic lasted only a short while. The Kingdom was restored by a coup d'état lead by General Sanjurjo just a year later. Still, the memories of the short-lived failure that was the Spanish Republic fuel the regime's opponents left and right.\n\nTo date, there remain deep divisions within Spanish society. On the one hand, the resurgent Carlist Movement, headed by Alfonso Carlos, aims to re-establish the 'True Dynasty' and recreate an integralist Christian monarchy, and on the other, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI seeks the abolition of the Spanish state altogether, and to replace it with a voluntary federation of communes and economic collectives. Yet more, the Republicans of Izquierda Republicana and Derecha Liberal Republicana defiantly contest our right to rule. If the political split is not mended, Spain might even see a Civil War."
sprd.1.a:0 "Let us prevail."
sprd.1.b:0 "Tell me more about Sanjurjada."

sprd.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Spain!"
sprd.2.d:0 "The Spanish economy has been in an upwards trajectory ever since the end of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, with Latin American trade blooming and the steady stream of Mitteleuropan tourists spreading the contents of their fat purses on the Catalan shores. However, it has certainly not been an easy couple of decades, with the war against the devils of Abd el Krim in Northern Africa proving a costly venture for Spain and the collapse of Franco-British trade following the twin revolutions being a catastrophic addition to the war debts. In addition to these setbacks, the introduction of cheap and plentiful Ukrainian grain to European markets has made it increasingly difficult for the large latifundios of Castille, La Mancha and Andalusia to compete, and wheat prices have only been kept at reasonable levels through increasingly protectionist measures.\n\nNonetheless, ever since the collapse of the Spanish republic and the one-party rule of Acción Popular under José María Gil-Robles, Spain has become an increasingly close partner to the Mitteleuropan trade giant, and while full membership has still eluded the Kingdom, the government has been in the process of considering this for the last couple months. However, few voices can now call for such measures, as news from Berlin tell of a terrible market crash, causing the entire European economy to crumble under the weight of the Teuton failures. Spain, thanks to its protectionist measures, has been able to somewhat survive this initial financial freefall, but the sudden pulling out of German capital from Spanish banks and industry has left deep scars in the nation.\n\nMany now curse the government for aligning so closely with the Germans, and the socialists of Unión General de Trabajadores and syndicalists of Confederación Nacional del Trabajo have emerged en masse from their hiding places to protest the government policies on the streets of large cities. Riots, strikes and even gunfights between radicals and the Guardia Civil are common place throughout the nation, and as Spain wakes up to a new day, many more come to realize that the seeming glimmer of hope for the Spanish economy has, in the span of a single day, been extinguished by Black Monday. The nation has no time to mourn for this loss of prosperity, however, as the government must leap into action to enact emergency measures for the good of the economy. Whether these measures will be enough or not remains to be seen, and many compromises lay ahead until Spain is truly free from the aftermath of German failures, but with enough grit and determination, perhaps a total collapse can be avoided."

### Carlist Events ###

sprd.4.t:0 "Carlist Succession Crisis"
sprd.4.d:0 "During the hundred years of its history Carlism was headed by six successive claimants with clear heritage rights; however, in the early 1930s it was evident that the dynasty would soon extinguish. The pretender, Don Alfonso Carlos, was eighty-two years old upon assuming the claim in 1931 and had no issue. More troubling was the fact that Don Alfonso Carlos appeared to lean towards reconciliation with the Isabelline kings currently occupying the Spanish throne. After the death of Don Alfonso Carlos, King Alfonso XIII of Spain will be the senior male descendant of Carlos IV.\n\nNevertheless, the majority of Carlists consider Alfonso disqualified because he does not share the Carlist ideals and because Spanish law excludes from succession the descendants of those who commit treason against the king, as Carlists deem Alfonso's male-line ancestors to have done when Francisco de Paula recognized the reign of Isabella II. Duke Javier of Bourbon-Parma is the most likely successor to Don Alfonso Carlos as he currently acts as the elderly claimant's representative in Spain. Alternatively, Archduke Karl Pius von Habsburg claims to be the legitimate Carlist claimant through the rights of his mother, Infanta Blanca. Both refuse to recognize the present King of Spain."
sprd.4.a:0 "The Carlists must be plotting something."

sprd.5.t:0 "Javier de Borbón-Parma y de Braganza"
sprd.5.d:0 "Javier de Borbón-Parma is considered the natural successor to the Carlist cause due to his close relationship with Don Alfonso Carlos de San Jaime. The second son of the last reigning Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Duke Javier was torn between the great powers of Europe during the Weltkrieg. Initially planning to enlist in the Austrian army to avenge his cousin Franz Ferdinand, plans changed when his adoptive France declared war on Austria-Hungary. After the Weltkrieg, Duke Javier retired to Vienna and avoided politics until the 1930s. It was in Vienna that he fostered his relationship with Don Alfonso Carlos and took an interest in Spanish legitimism, i.e. Carlism. In 1934, he moved to Spain to act as the royal octogenarian's representative. Javier is devoutly Catholic and committed to legitimism, though some far-right Traditionalists question his absolutist bona fides.\n\nSince coming to Spain, he has been a thorn in the side of King Alfonso XIII and his government. His political profile and popularity are troubling. Yesterday, he gave a speech arguing that the Kingdom of Spain needs to work together with its Catholic neighbours. He proposed an economic bloc with other Mediterranean nations to support each other through free trade."
sprd.5.a:0 "He is a threat. Keep him under surveillance."

sprd.6.t:0 "Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena y de Borbón"
sprd.6.d:0 "Born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria, Archduke Karl Pius von Habsburg might seem like an odd choice for Spanish succession. Yet, through his mother, Infanta Blanca de Borbón, Karl is the grandson of Carlos VII, the last legitimate Carlist King of Spain. Unlike Duke Javier, Carlos Pío has lived in Barcelona since the 1920s. He returned to Austria briefly in the early 1930s, where he joined nationalist causes and participated in street fights with syndicalists. A significant minority of the Carlist movement believes that Carlos Pío is the natural and legitimate claimant to the throne of Spain, due to his mother's lineage and his rightist views.\n\nThe Carlist doctrine of Dual Legitimacy requires that a potential King descend legitimately from Carlos V and maintain 'legitimacy of execution' through a commitment to Spanish Traditionalism and Carlist principles. As the male line of Carlist Bourbons will be extinct when Alfonso Carlos dies without issue, descent must by necessity track through the eldest female, Infanta Blanca, and through her to her son, Carlos Pío. Carlos Pío has older brothers, but they have disqualified themselves through morganatic marriages and abdications. Carlos Pío, on the other hand, remains unmarried and has a demonstrated commitment to Traditionalism. The Archduke's supporters, known as Carloctavistas, already refer to him as Carlos VIII."
sprd.6.a:0 "A Spanish Habsburg?"

sprd.7.t:0 "Alfonso Carlos de Borbón Dies"
sprd.7.d:0 "Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, and the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, died today in Vienna at the age of 87. He was killed in an automobile accident while crossing the street. His passing, expected at his age, but no less sudden, has thrown the Carlist factions of Spain into chaos. The current king of Spain, Alfonso XIII, is now by right the head of the Capetian dynasty. Alas, the Carlist movement rejects any compromise with the traitorous Isabelline dynasty. They are divided between Duke Javier and Archduke Carlos, a pair of foreigners! The will of Alfonso Carlos indicates that Duke Javier should be regent of the Carlist movement until a legitimate claimant is chosen."
sprd.7.a:0 "Why don't they like me?"

sprd.37.t:0 "The Grand Carlist Assembly"
sprd.37.d:0 "Following the death of Don Alfonso Carlos, there is now a divide within Carlism. A small portion of Carlists believe it is finally time to reconcile with the Isabelline kings. This is obviously unacceptable. The majority of Carlists support the final wishes of Don Alfonso Carlos and will follow the regent, Don Javier as the next leader of the Carlists. A significant minority with support drawn especially from the Carlist militias of the northeast, the Requetés, support the claim of Archduke Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena. Don Javier knows the Carlist revolution will not succeed without the Navarrese and Basque Requetés, but is loathe to come to an accord with Carlos Pío. As a last resort, a Grand Assembly has been called in Pamplona, to be attended by leading Carlists. They will decide on the legitimate heir to the Carlist claim. Who will succeed? Don Javier or Archduke Carlos Pío?"

### Unstable Spain Events ###

sprd.9.t:0 "Assassination of Luciano Malumbres"
sprd.9.d:0 "The city of Santander mourns as the local president of Popular Athenaeum of Santander, Luciano Malumbres Francés, was assassinated earlier this week by a Carlist gunman. Malumbres was known for being a fiery propagandist, and while he had attempted to remain relatively quiet during the initial years of Acción Popular’s one-party government, he had returned to his job as a journalist now that the Spanish opposition grew bolder. From the pages of a local newspaper La Región, he attacked reactionaries, conservatives and whoever else he considered an enemy of Spain, and his columns often descended to straight libel. The local police had ordered him to stop once already, and anonymous letters threatening him with extreme reactions had been directed at the man for quite some time, but Malumbres persisted to the day of his death. Earlier this week Malumbres had gone to play dominoes with friends in a local bar, when a gunman of Carlist origin entered and immediately fired twice at the journalist, wounding him gravely.\n\nThe assassin tried to escape down the street and once he had run a considerable distance from the place of the crime, threw a raincoat over his suit to conceal himself. However, this precaution proved futile as an angry mob caught the man, and once cornered, a local shot him in the back before police could intervene and bring him to questioning. Malumbres was rushed to a local hospital, put under the scalpel and given emergency blood transfusion, but these measures proved too little and too late, and the journalist died soon after. Local underground socialist union Federación Obrera Montañesa has come out of hiding to declare a general strike in the province of Cantabria, though local Guardia Civil and police officers are dealing with the consequences as of now. Still, the situation has not only given publicity to the Carlist radicals but has also made the socialist workers in the region far more frustrated with the current situation in Spain. Malumbres’ widow, Matilde Zapata, has sworn to continue her late husband’s work to completion as a writer of La Región."

A firefight broke out between the various factions after labour conflicts, and numerous men on both sides were hit in the brief skirmish.\n\nAmong them was a mere 19-year old Laudelino Sánchez Solís, supporter of SOMA, who had been hit so badly that he was bleeding out. Seeing the consequences of the situation, the members of SCOM fled with their wounded, and Sánchez was taken to the hospital at Oviedo, but the wound could not be operated in time and the young syndicalist died in the hospital hours later. Four men linked to both organizations were later arrested by local Guardia Civil. The entire showdown echoes the tragic events of 1920, when in the town of Moreda de Aller, SCOM and SOMA engaged one another in a firefight, resulting in the deaths of eleven men, with thirty-five others wounded. The region has seen increased violence since the Asturian rising in 1934, and SCOM has seen its ranks increase as a reaction to the increased left-wing agitation. SCOM is allied to the Carlists of the region, and thus this increase is hardly welcomed by the government in Madrid, but at least it seems that they are too preoccupied with the socialists to give Madrid too much trouble"

sprd.17.d:0 "Recent report from a the General Directory of Security, headed by Acción Popular politician José Finat y Escrivá de Romaní, has indicated that the anarchists led by Buanaventura Durruti and the infamous Ascaso brothers have begun to coordinate attacks on various smaller outposts of Guardia Civil in the smaller towns and villages of Spain. Most notable the mining town of Alt Llobregat saw a recent minor uprising as the local garrison was hit while most of its troops were out on patrol, the armoury of the town pillaged by anarchists and connections to the outside world such as the telephone lines cut by members of the local anarchists. It is believed that the group is led by Francisco Ascaso, a close associate of Buanaventura Durruti, operating under the name of Los Solidarios, a name his men have not operated since the early 1920s. Their attacks in Catalonia and Aragon may be little more than a nuisance, but the inability of Guardia Civil and the Carabineros in hunting these ruffians out is making the government look rather terrible in the eyes of many."

sprd.18.d:0 "Violent events have shook the city of Malaga, with anarchist gunmen and fighters from the reactionary and traditionalist Legionarios de España clashing after the death of a police informant. Antonio Rubio Aguilar was murdered on the streets few days ago in a hit and run attak performed by local elements of CNT-FAI, as the man was suspected by the anarchists of delivering insider information to the Cuerpo de Vigilancia. The murder launched a police investigation but the rumours caused the local branch of Legionarios de España, a para-military force centred around the traditionalist group Partido Nacionalista Español, to strike back at the anarchists. In a similar hit and run, these reactionary militiamen struck the local anarchist headquarters, firing from a car at any windows, resulting the death of a single anarchist worker in the building. The police has been alerted to react, though they are unsure on who they are supposed to be attacking given that both sides of the conflict have perpetrated violent crime. PNE is technically an ally of the government but its continued use of violent and populist rhetoric has made many sour on the group."

sprd.19.t:0 "Yeste Massacre"
sprd.19.d:0 "The government has faced a serious stain upon its attempts to create a facade of legitimacy and non-violence after press reports from the town of Yeste have drifted to the forefront of national news. The peasants and workers of the town, tired of the slow progress of promised agrarian reform, took it upon themselves to retake the local forest area known as Dehesa de Tus, where lumberjacks soon set upon to cut down the trees for the peasants to convert it into a public use field for the town’s poorest folk. The territory had previously been public grounds but had been privatized as part of Acción Popular’s efforts to curb the land requisitions performed by the republic, and the local people had had enough with the situation. \n\nLocal Guardia Civil arrived at the scene but did not immediate intervene beyond ordering the men to stop, and upon the arrival of the town’s mayor, it became clear that the peasants and the mayor were in an alliance. Guardia Civil called for backup but the courier they had requested was kidnapped on the way to the local headquarters, and in the following day, angry peasants surrounded the ad hoc barracks of the Guards, demanding that they leave, though the crowd dispersed after the Guards fired into the air. More guards soon made their way to the region despite the unfortunate fate of the courier, and the loggers were detained, but this caused another wave of unrest and more peasants streamed into Yeste to challenge the Guardia Civil posted there. The Guard manages to capture six loggers and organizes a release of the prisoners in exchange for the cessation of the logging, but as they arrive to make the release, the Guads led by Brigadier Velando find themselves surrounded by nearly two thousand local peasants.\n\nDespite the release of the loggers, the situation escalates as the angry and frustrated peasants attack the guards, but despite the massive size difference between the platoon of Guards and thousands of peasants, the Guards managed to hold long enough and the peasants’ morale broke. Multiple Guardia Civil officers and dozens of peasants had died in the bloodbath, and while the government has been quick to blame the ‘infiltrators and agitators from the [SPRGetSprd19PSOEMention]’ as the main reason for the massacre, opposition politicians even on the moderate side such as Niceto Alcala-Zamora and Diego Martinez Barrio have claimed this to be a clear sign of popular frustration with the government and their lackluster policies to alleviate the needs of rural people. In response, the underground socialist union UGT has proclaimed a strike in Albacete, which was quickly suppressed by the authorities, and unrest grows in the countryside even further."

sprd.20.d:0 "Yet another violent fight between right-wing agitators and socialist has led to casualties in the municipality of Aznalcóllar, where two young members of the Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, a far-right party of Onésimo Redondo have been killed. These JCAH members had arrived to the town to distribute party propaganda in the town square, and local left-wing workers intervened, resulting in arguments and the eventual stabbing of one of the JCAH agitators, Adrián Irusta. The scene was dispersed by the police, but the next day, more far-right troublemakers arrived to face their socialist counterparts and a massive fight, this time without police intervention initially, broke out, leading to nearly two hours of immense hand-to-hand combat.\n\nFive men were wounded and another member of JCAH, Manuel García Míguez, was killed after a stone thrown by the socialists hit his head. As police arrived to the scene once more, the crowd was dispersed and while most of the fighters got away, the wounded were incarcerated, awaiting trial. However, the nationalist conservative member of Unión Monárquica Nacional José Antonio Primo de Rivera, has announced that he will personally act as their lawyer, citing that the men were unfairly attacked by socialist agitators for simply carrying out legal political actions. The prisoners’ situation is not helped by the recent murder of a taxi driver in the city, however, as Antonio Sánchez Álvarez was murdered by presumed members of JCAH after driving them to a locatíon of their choice. It is presumed that this was revenge for the party members lost in the recent fight, and while the government of Spain hardly has sympathies fo the socialists, the dangerous group JCAH is clearly harmful to public order as well."

sprd.38.t:0 "From a Funeral to a Bloodbath"
sprd.38.d:0 "Throughout the rule of Accion Popular, the prime minister and leader of the party, José María Gil-Robles, has attempted to put on a strong front by holding frequent military and Guardia Civil parades in Madrid. However, a recent parade turned into a farce when, mere moments since the Guardia Civil companies had assumed formation and begun marching, anarchist gunmen rushed the scene shouting ‘Unión de Hermanos Proletarios’, a left-wing revolutionary alliance that caused the Asturias uprising of 1934. They threw firecrackers into the crowd and fired into the air, with some taking potshots at the balcony from where Gil-Robles and other prominent members of AP had gathered to survey the situation. The Guards retaliated immediately, but not before a couple had been hit by stray bullets, and the firefight turned into utter chaos as the anarchists beat a hasty retreat using makeshift explosives and incendiary weapons as cover.\n\nOnly Guardia Civil member to have perished was Anastasio de los Reyes López, while couple others were wounded by the bullets, and the anarchists lost a lone gunman to the rifles of the Guards. However, the violence was far from over, as when Guardia Civil gathered to bury captain de los Reyes, accompanied by Gil-Robles and other well-known members of the Spanish right, such as José Calvo Sotelo, Antonio Goicoechea and José Antonio Primo de Rivera, the funeral itself was attacked by the same anarchist group. Officials had expected such an event and press censorship on the time of the funeral had been issued, as well as a great deal of secrecy on the whereabouts of the cadaver, but nonetheless, the anarchists had managed to gain enough intelligence on the matter to plan the attack. As the body of de los Reyes was being transported to its final resting place, the anarchists would make several attacks on the convoy, countered at every turn by Guardia Civil troops, with much of the fighting taking place on the tight streets and corridors of Madrid.\n\nRooftop snipers and guerillas hiding among the protestors piled up on the streets attempted to defile the ceremony numerous times, but were beaten back and eventually,the funeral convoy made it to its target, setting the Guard captain to rest on the ground. The final death tolly during the event rose to over thirty people dead and many, many more wounded, with an unknown number of anarchists slain or wounded. Guardia Civil is currently carrying out arrests throughout the city to capture the perpetrators, but this assault is yet another sad reminder to Spaniards that the state is heading towards chaos and civil strife at an increasing rate. Many moderate socialists and syndicalists, such as Julián Besteiro, Ángel Pestaña and Fernando de los Rios have denounced the attacks as barbaric and unjust bloodletting with no real purpose than to sow chaos, though their comments are lost to the sea of right-wing fury as every conservative newspaper in Madrid is calling for the destruction of CNT-FAI."

sprd.39.t:0 "The Madrid Faculty of Law Incident"
sprd.39.d:0 "The Carlist student organization Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista has made national headlines when a group of AET’s students broke into the Faculty of Law in Madrid by force and began to spread leaflets around the bemused residents of the building. These leaflets denounced the actions of Acción Popular government, calling them allies of ‘Masons, international Jewery and socialist rabble’, with some of the leaflets warning against the rise of syndicalism and separatism promoted by the Commune of France and both Basque and Catalan nationalists. Assistants from the dean’s office tried to push the zealots back using pistols and knives, and only the intervention of university guards was enough to push these Carlist fanatics away from the Faculty, though not before they managed to spread a banner calling for the return of the true king of Spain and a crusade to reclaim the true heart of Spain. \n\nThe debacle thankfully did not cause much more than a few bruises after an altercation with the guards, and the Carlist youths are now in police custody, but there are worrying signs that members of AET around the nation may attempt to pull similar stunts. The faculty’s dean, Adolfo González-Posada, linked to regenerationist liberalism and Krausopositivism promoted by the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, may have been the true target of the attack, given his relatively progressive beliefs, and while the Carlists were unable to touch the man, the incident has led him to resign from his post out of fear for his personal safety, an event that is celebrated by traditionalist students all across Spain."

sprd.40.t:0 "The Defection of Albiñana"
sprd.40.d:0 "Seeing the Acción Popular actively drift closer to its republican rivals, many right-wing parties such as Partido Nacionalista Español have officially ceased all support for the government, and according to the security officials under the state’s employ, some have gone as far as to enter negotiations with the Carlist Comunión Tradicionalista. Partido Nacionalista is perhaps the most notable such defection, as while the party holds little actual power and is mostly a fringe party operating in areas such as Castile and La Mancha, it projects more power than one would expect thanks to its powerful paramilitary known as Legionarios de España. Recently, these Legionaries have once more continued active attacks on republicans, most notably harassing republican allies of the government such as Miguel Maura and Jacinto Benavente.\n\nThey claim that the AP government has been taken over by a Jewish conspiracy, and that only through decisive monarchist and traditionalist action can Spain be saved now. While a quick surgical strike at Partido Nacionalista now could probably destroy them where they stand, as the party is little more than a group of hooligans and loudmouths gathering under their leader Dr. José María Albiñana, their theoretical alliance with the Carlists makes this course of action too risky to pursue while AP is still gathering allies. Still, it is hoped that due to the tiny nature of the party, the threat they pose is not worth the effort of squashing them, and most of the action from AP’s side has been to ensure that their harassment campaign is brought to a halt due to police intervention."

sprd.41.d:0 "Earlier today, the garrison of Pamplona’s Guardia Civil reported a missing convoy of weapons and ammunition that was bound to arrive there from La Rioja. However, upon further investigation the local Guards found the convoy on a remote road, with signs of an ambush and five dead members of the military left at the sight of the crime. While bandits and highwaymen have become increasingly common in Spain over these four years of instability after the Sanjurjada coup, it is believed that this recent attack was the work of huidos, Republican-era refugees who fled to the Pyrenean mountains after the coup and have continued to fight the new government ever since. \n\nHuidos are typically supplied by the Commune, but this recent attack shows that these anarchists, socialists, communists and other republican fighters may very well be stocking up for a far bigger fights, given that thus far they have mostly relied on old imported rifles and even hunting weapons to fight. It is believed that the central hub of these fighters is the town of Argelès-sur-Mer in France, where they coordinate further strikes over the border. There have been some cells of these forces left in other parts of Spain as well, especially in Extremadura and Asturias, but the methodical actions of Guardia Civil and Carabineros has been greatly effective at rooting these out.\n\nHowever, with the Pamplona attack being simply one among many, it is clear that the republicans are planning something, and if the government wishes to be ready, it must deploy more troops to the vital Pyrenean mountain chain to clear these dissidents out once and for all. The recent raid led to the capture of more than three hundred rifles and multiple large packs of ammunition, so the perfidious huidos are now more equipped than ever, and neglecting their presence is a sure-fire way to a disaster, but the government of Acción Popular may very well wish to keep its men in the cities and other large arteries of the Spanish state."

sprd.42.d:0 "The sleepy mountain town of Salardú, in the Occitan enclave of Spain in Vall d’Aran, northern Catalonia, has become a place of battle as a small group of anarchists, socialists and republicans crossed the Commune of France border and attacked the local police station, capturing the town quickly and cutting communication lines before the town authorities could alert wider Spain of what was happening. However, this rag-tag group soon ran into issues as the group’s leader, Vicente López Tovar, was planning to advance further and upon attacking numerous nearby hamlets, López was struck by a stray bullet fired by local Carabineros guards. The force had been meant as a mere scouting party that would test the defences of Spain for a wider broad front republican attack over the French border, possibly using Catalan and Basque nationalists as allies in the struggle against the Madrid government, but with the wounding of López the small group was left leaderless and retreated back to Salardú, where they soon found themselves surrounded by Guardia Civil forces.\n\nOnly the intervention of a small Catalan separatist force, belonging to the Palestra scouting organization and the radical separatist terrorist group Nosaltres Sols allowed the insurgents to retreat over the border back to France, but the battle left numerous dead on both sides and decimated the town centre of Salardú, with a couple civilian casualties caused by stray bullets and shrapnel from grenades. The government of José María Gil-Robles has issued a stark warning to the Communard government that any such attempts in the future would not end with just Spanish-on-Spanish action, but that the Spanish security forces would stop at nothing to drive any republicans out with fire and flame. These warnings have, as usual, fallen on deaf ears, but the profound failure of the republican expedition is likely to put a damper on the efforts of these terrorists in the future."

Many of our centralist parties, such as Accion Popular, see the existence of autonomous regions as a breeding ground for separatism, and many even in our government tend to agree with this sentiment. After all, the would-be assailant of Alfonso XIII was Catalan radical separatist\n\nOthers, more moderate parties such as Derecha Liberal Republicana, PSOE and Izquierda Republicana have advised agreed to support the creation of so called Autonomous Communes, which would finally acknowledge the various cultures, languages and peoples as equals.

sprd.111.d:0 "Few expected CNT-FAI, one of the most important actors in Spain's political scene, to simply fall apart, but that appears to be the case. After their loss in the "mandate' elections of 1937, the movement seemed to honour the agreement at first, but parts of CNT and FAI eventually regressed back into using terror tactics against their class enemies. However, given the electoral success of moderate socialists in PSOE, and their shown ability to achieve many rather radical reforms without revolutionary means, there are those within CNT-FAI who have become disillusioned to the extreme methods of the party and union.\n\nÁngel Pestaña and his followers inside the political movement have published the so-called Manifiesto de los Treinta, which condemned these means and called for the party to instead focus its attention to obtaining legal credibility. He stressed the successes of PSOE in similar strategy, and as a long-time advocater for CNT-FAI to become a true political party as well as first-hand witness to the horrors of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia decades ago, his words managed to convince many in the ranks of the anarchists.\n\nWhile  many hardliners will not accept this shift, a considerable bulk of CNT-FAI members have joined the new Partido Sindicalista, Pestaña's new party. The new party has announced that it will run in the coming elections, and while not a forerunner for election winner, they may have a chance at victory if enough anarchists abandon their previous anti-political attitude and turn up to the polls to support their parliamentary comrades. Right-wing parties, principally Accion Popular, Derecha Regional Agrario and the Carlists have condemned them as agents of Communards, but the king and most of Cortes have allowed them to run as part of the democratic process, especially considering how it weakens the terrorist side of CNT-FAI."

sprd.112.d:0 "After the election victory of Accion Popular showed Spaniards that the right-wing monarchists could still hold their grounds against the former republicans despite the democratization of the Kingdom, new movements have begun developing to contest Accion Popular's grip on their voter base. One such movement, and the most likely to dislodge the former from their seat as primary monarchist party, is Partido Nacionalista Español. Returning from the brink of irrelevancy, it's fiery denouncement of republican and socialist values has brought it many supporters. Backed by the Catholic church and agrarian peasants from the more conservative regions of Spain, the party seeks to eradicate regionalism by centralizing the Kingdom, defeat the socialist parties by utilizing its supporters in the Sindicatos Libres to harass them, and finish off any republican sentiments by allying with like-minded centre- and extreme-right parties to form a cohesive bloc against anything that would threaten the traditional Spain.\n\nWhile not publicly endorsed by the king, its leader José María Albiñana has announced that he wishes to expand the king's powers closer to their original scope, although the party leader has somewhat tried to moderate this rhetoric to not lose any credibility inside the democratic system. The party views corporatism, social Catholicism and uniting monarch as the cornerstones of its program, and while not anti-democratic per se, many view it with suspicion of harbouring dangerous authoritarian viewpoints. Whether the party will be a death knell to Spain's young democracy or not will be seen, though first this party must pass the hurdle of defeating its rivals in the elections."

In the rural areas, as well as whole regions such as Asturias, small-scale revolts from the likes of CNT and FAI are happening constantly, the anarchists attacking estates and police stations in a hit-and-run fashion. The king and his allies in Accion Popular and the military have deployed military forces to quell the riots, but these units are used sparingly, as to avoid the conscripts from joining forces with the rioters. The perfidious republicans are arranging protests even in areas where radical riots are not a problem. And in the overseas territories, especially Moroccan coastal areas, the devious Moroccans have sent agitators and saboteurs over the border, driving the locals to a frenzy. The military has been unable to deploy the loyalist Spanish legion in the metropolitan areas because of the fear of Moroccan revolt, but with the chaos unfolding, the Legion has made it to the mainland now. However, despite the dire straits Spain is in right now, it seems that the emergency measures taken after the election by the monarchists have paid off, as the socialists and republicans are split between the insurrectionists and those who honour the democratic mandate of Accion Popular.\n\nHowever, in the chaos the central government did not realize the lack of news from the minority regions of Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia. In a surprise declaration, the three regions denounced the centralist policies of the monarchy and its military allies, and claimed that Spain has fallen back to its reactionary abyss, stomping on the rights of its peoples just to enrich Castile. Despite all the promises, autonomy to the minority peoples of Spain was never delivered in full. Now, the Basques, Catalans and Galicians would join each other in solidarity and officially separate from the dying empire of Castile and its chauvinistic domination of sovereign peoples. The three separatists called for other peoples’ of Spain to seize the moment as well, and free themselves from the Bourbon tyrants once and for all. The central government, overstretched as it was with internal strife, could not respond to this new threat, and the local Guardia Civil units retreated from the regionalist areas, for the time being. The Rif region, left with a small guard unit under General Varela, has been mostly left to its own devices, and until the crisis on the peninsula is solved, Varela must cope alone."

Thousands of loyal Spanish sons lay dead in shallow graves or puddles, riddled with the lead of the Basques, Catalans and Galicians, and the price has been extreme for the terrain gained. Despite the sacrifices, atrocities and the near complete exhaustion of the Spanish war machine, the separatists yet remain, and many within the high command fear that the army may buckle under the pressure should we attempt to pressure on.\n\nGenerals Mola and Martinez Anido have been vehement of the need to continue, claiming that leaving the separatists independent will just invite further minority unrest, while generals Sanjurjo and Goded have claimed that the army cannot fight any longer due to the immense casualties and overall exhaustion.

Now, the armies of Castile stride forth from Madrid, Sevilla and Oviedo, and with the mighty generals in charge of these loyal men, the separatist scum will be crushed under heel in no time.\n\nThe regular army organic divisions will be supplemented by paramilitary forces from loyal parties, such as the Green Berets of Renovación Española, the dawn patrols of Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, the Juventudes de Acción Popular, the Legionaries of España belonging to Partido Nacionalista Español and finally, the Guerillas de España led by the Rif war hero Juan de Ansaldo.\n\nWhile these militias will primarily deal with resistance in the backlines, as CNT-FAI rebels are wreaking havoc in the Spanish countryside and PSOE-UGT saboteurs and rioters are looting Spain’s cities, some will assist in crushing the separatist scum. We defeated the pathetic invasion of Catalan separatist at Prats de Mollo a decade ago, we crushed the anarchist and socialist rising of 1934 without much effort, and the Rif war, despite the devastation, was a Spanish victory in the end.\nThe Spanish army has beaten its internal foes before, and it will do so this time again.

The king, seeing the writing on the wall, followed in his father’s footsteps, and has boarded a plane headed for Portugal earlier this morning. With the country spiraling out of control, a group of generals have stepped in once more to stop this chaos from leading to total eradication of Spain. Led by the populist general Sanjurjo, the new regime has denounced all enemies of Spain, from anarchists, socialists and republicans all the way to the separatists. The new junta, however, is not exactly united in vision, and the bickering of the generals has made any proper counter-attack against the separatists possible.\n\nRealizing this, general Sanjurjo has gathered the generals for a meeting in the military headquarters of Madrid, seeking to settle the leadership question of the new Spain once and for all. This decision is hardly surprising, as Sanjurjo has immense amount of political clout due to the success of his Sanjurjada, the revolt that ended the republican regime in 1932. However, his rule is far from absolute, as many in Spain and among the military blame him for all the mistakes of the last few years. Contesting his rule are a selection of generals, all with their own visions for Spain. Perhaps the most peculiar character is the leader of the Spanish Legion, José Millan-Astray, who is known as an eccentric fanatic, with some claiming him to be borderline insane due to drug use and war injuries. His polar opposite is Emilio Mola, who is known for his calculating nature and usage of extreme means while working as a chief security official of the Spanish republic and later, kingdom. Camilo Alonso Vega, Juan Yague and Francisco Franco Bahamonde represent more traditional junta members, following many of the tenets established in the Primo de Rivera era, though Alonso Vega and Juan Yague are willing to go further on many issues than Franco. Yague is also known for his sympathies towards Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, a far-right party espousing Hispanist ideology.  Finally, the junta could simply install the son of Primo de Rivera, José Antonio, as the leader. While not a military man, the young Primo de Rivera has been remarkably active in politics of Accion Popular and enjoys a great deal of influence among the far-right of Spain.

While the party still chafes under the restrictions placed upon it by the democratic system, some members of AP have begun to embrace it fully. The party still retains some of its authoritarian characteristics, willing to use force against the syndicalist infiltrators of CNT-FAI and Carlist devils, but the infamous Greenshirts of AP have very much been leashed from their youthful rage against the would-be oppressors of Spain’s faithful and noble people. The party now leans more towards typical Christian democrats, just with a few more aces up its sleeve and a considerably bolstered radical wing. The king himself has praised this development, claiming that without Accion Popular’s commitment to democracy, the new crown could not have legitimized its rule as easily, and by creating a more moderate version of themselves, Accion Popular has managed to convince many of even Spain’s royal house being able to adjust for the times as well."

sprd.122.d:0 "The 19th century was very difficult for Spain in general, but few events of that turbulous era left such a mark on Spanish public consciousness as the Spanish-American war of the mid-1890s. The loss of our last overseas colonial holdings in America and Asia, namely the islands of Cuba and Philippines, sent Spanish public into a deep crisis. Our society had been based on imperial glory, colonial pride and the Restoration era circulation of parties, known as el turno pacífico, where the Spanish Liberal and Conservative parties alternated in the government. When the colonies were lost, the entire Spanish economy and cultural basis pulled the plug on this alternating system and revealed the many flaws in it, which in turn lead to academic opposition and protests. These academics would be the very beginnings of Generation ‘98, and while this movement started as a simple protest, it soon evolved into complete regeneration of Spain’s culture, ranging from literature to music. The movement spawned such titans of Spanish culture as Miguel de Unamuno, Pio Baroja and Joaquin Costa.\n\nThe generation was highly influenced by the ideas of German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause, who was best known for his arguments for academics to be free of dogmatic thinking, and to some extent, his ideas on divinity more as an universal essence rather than as a personalist mythical figure. The influence of Krausism also helped shape the movement towards more egoist direction. The generation demanded change in Spain’s political scene, and that itself created an atmosphere of acceptance towards radicalism, aimed at changing the stalled political scene and the impotent reforms brought about by el turno pacífico. Like most generations in Spain’s history, Generation of ‘98 was not particularly ideologically aligned, instead inspiring actors from left-wing revolutionaries all the way to the right-wing traditionalists, all calling for Spain to regenerate and rejuvenate itself, though the means to achieve this differed greatly from actor to another. Accion Popular, also greatly inspired by this movement and two of its most prolific writers, Ramiro de Maeztu and Joaquin Costa, has started a program aimed at promoting the ideas and works of the generation, with of course the left-wing ideologues excluded from the program. The leadership of the party hopes that this increased attention will bring about a more patriotic Spanish youth eventually."

sprd.123.d:0 "Despite our successful electoral results and a rather tremendous reimagination of Accion Popular, the party still remains as a big-tent for various monarchists, both reactionary and liberal, as well as agrarians, Christian democrats and even fringe legionaries. These factions have generally agreed upon a policy of Christian conservatism and moderate monarchism, but as time passes, the factionalism is starting to tear us apart. Leadership of the party, as well as the king, finds this situation untenable. The king has urged us to pick a direction before we face oblivion at the hands of our more ideologically rigid rivals. This decision, however, is bound to be a hard one. We can obviously fully dedicate our party program to Christian democracy, placating the moderates and centre of our party, but losing support from the more radical factions. There are however other, less conventional choices proposed by other party members.\n\nOur prime minister, José María Gil-Robles, has long been an admirer of Austrian right-wing demagogue, Engelbert Dolfuss, and the Austropopulist ideology he champions in the heartland of Catholicism. This choice would be a radical one, as Austropopulism has hardly been tried in a democratic system and its critics consider it wholly incompatible. However, the corporatist, nationalist and fiercely Catholic nature does draw some of the most firebrand monarchists within our party towards this conclusion.\n\nOthers, less extreme members of AP seek to steer the movement towards more traditional conservatism, following the Maurist ideology of strong state intervention, moderate Spanish nationalism, social Catholicism and the integration of some liberal ideals into the Spanish right. While less radical than Austropopulism, Maurism is also somewhat marred by the many directions the movement has been pulled towards by various politicians, such as Antonio Goicoechea and Jose Calvo Sotelo. However, Maurism under Gabriel Maura, Antonio’s son, is considered the current mainstream form, and is likely to be the most palatable to democratic Spain."

While Spain is yet to reclaim the glory days of the empire, we have thwarted its descent into chaos and ruin, and from here, we can only take it to greater heights! Spain is back as a global power, and like the armadas of the past, our reach will only grow from here, destroying socialists and agents of false gods as we march onwards. While we may not hold the absolute power we did years ago, Accion Popular has shown itself adaptive enough to fit into the defines of democracy, although very much in our own way.

But the coup of 1932 saved Spain from this terrible fate, and for four years, General Jose Sanjurjo allowed us to rule Spain and shape it in our image. While that period was mired by conflicts within Accion Popular, instability caused by terrorists, both the blasted separatists and the demonic anarchists, and the weak position of our king and government due to military interference, it was also the height of our power thus far. Yet with two electoral victories under our belt in a very short span of time, first against our arch-nemesi, the Carlists and anarchists, and then against the republicans, we have shown thoroughly that the Spanish people trust our rule above all else. \n\nWith this newfound mandate, and the weakened grip of the military on Spanish affairs, we can finally set upon fulfilling the wishes of AP leadership. Spain shall be united and freed from the insidious influence of syndicalists and Carlists alike, and the corrupting influence of republicanism will be cremated once and for all. The various regional parties that constitute the Accion Popular have rallied under the banner of Spanish monarchist right, and we have even been bolstered by defectors from the Carlist cause, so AP is finally strong enough to contest even the strongest ex-republican party in congress.

sprd.126.d:0 "As the new constitutional monarchy solidifies in Spain, the parties themselves are equally shifting in their policies to fit this new system. One of the most curious cases to observe has been the rebranded Partido Radical led by Alejandro Lerroux, which in the past was a thorn in the kingdom’s side due to its incredibly strong anti-clericalism and negative stance on the monarchy. Lerroux himself was implied to be part of many assassination attempts on king Alfonso even though nothing was ever confirmed. While his party would appear to be our staunchest enemy, this does not need to be the case. Lerroux is known to be a man of many vices, and his party is known for one thing above all else: corruption. In the last years, the radicalism of Partido Radical has vaned immensely, the party becoming little more than a political machine for Lerroux and his clique to chase more wealth and power. As such, while we share little with the Lerrouxists ideologically, allying them would not be particularly difficult.\n\nAccion Popular could promise to invest in the infrastructure of Lerroux’s seat of power, the boulevard of Paraleo in Barcelona, alongside a promise to turn a blind eye to the man’s ‘business’ ventures that certain law enforcement agencies in Spain would otherwise be quite interested in. In exchange, Lerroux would join us in coalition, and as his support base consists of the Spanish workers of Barcelona, we could use their helps to battle the great evils of Catalonia, the anarchists of CNT-FAI and the separatists of Nosaltres Sols. However, while Lerroux is more of an ally of convenience, there are other groups that align with us ideologically but lack the widespread support of AP. An influential but small party, Partido Agrario shares our rural-minded, Catholic and monarchist sentiments, but has always struggled to gather the popular support that we have. While more moderate than AP, Partido Agrario has been an electoral ally of the Carlists in the past and thus allying with them would starve our rivals of an ally."

The Peloponnese peninsula has seen nothing but misery, division and paranoia after the last Weltkrieg, and its once proud citizens have become nothing but pawns for the great powers of Europe. But to us loyal and fervent Catholics, no side in that conflict is as important as that of the Papal States, the most holy city serving as the seat of power for the representative of Christ on Earth, the Pope. When Italy fell to war and division, in a rare case of unity both Carlists and Alfonsist monarchists decided to fight side by side to stop the Reds from claiming the city, and the volunteers from that conflicts helped shape Papal-Spanish relations for decades to come. However, given the hard times Spain fell to in the last years, it has been hard to keep these relations as close as we would have liked. Now, however, as Accion Popular has solidified itself as the popular ruler of Spain, we must immediately dispatch an envoy to the Vatican and pledge our undying support to the righteous cause of God. Whichever side the Pope supports in the upcoming unification wars will be our ally as well, and together we shall destroy the godless syndicalists of the north. Italy will be united, and the seat of God’s power protected once more by pious sons of Italy, assisted by the Spaniards at every turn should they require the assistance.

sprd.128.d:0 "Since the coronation of Isabella II as the queen of Spain, our nation has been plagued by a pestilence known as Carlism. Clinging to an age-old dynastic feud, the Carlists have plunged Spain into numerous civil wars, coming out of their Navarran mountains to harass the good people of Spain. The untold damage they have done to our nation with their delusions and unjustified violence has taken blood, sweat and toil to repair, yet still their presence lingers in Spain’s northern territories, their fanatical followers, Requetes, striking our noble Carabineros like some sort of spectres of ruination. Their corrupting influence has been too hard to root out in the last few difficult decades, but similarly their relevance has been weakened. Only in the last few years during and after the republic did the movement gather enough steam to seriously contest the rightful king’s rule, and when the Carlists unsurprisingly were defeated in the elections, their movement fell apart. The hardliner Cruzadistas supporting Carlos Pio as king blamed the supporters of Javier Bourbon-Parma for the humiliating defeat, claiming that their softness prevented the Carlists from seizing the initiative and defeating the Alfonsine monarchy. The Intergristas, ideologically similar to the Frenchman Charles Maurras but far less concrete in their beliefs, simply either gave up or jumped ship to join Renovacion Espanola. This Carlist defeatism may have been rectified had they managed to unite under one candidate, but as Javier escaped to Algiers and Carlos returned to Austria, the movement began to fizzle out into oblivion. While hardliners still remain especially in Navarre and Basque Country, their numbers are not large enough to contest our rule, and some officers have demanded that the army boots finally stomp this pathetic pretender regime out. Others, such as colonel Valera and general Emilio Mola, current military commissioner of Pamplona, have urged for caution, arguing that the Carlists will run out of steam on their own. Ultimately, the decision lies on the king, as the officer corps is notoriously badly infiltrated by traditionalists, with even general Sanjurjo, the hero of the Alfonsine monarchy, being accused of harbouring Carlist sympathies. Without their leadership, it may be that the Carlists cannot unify en masse, but on the other hand further violence may cause political instability and prolong the existence of the Carlists if the operation fails."

JAP has grown to be one of the most powerful youth organizations in Spain, boasting close to 15 000 members, but its involvement with the regime has been far from easy. JAP continues to be a hotbed of radicalism within Accion Popular, and while in the past, during the years of AP’s sole governance, this was seen as ‘youthful desire to regenerate Spain’ and ‘ideological innovation for future monarchists’, this radicalism has become an awkward issue for the party. As Accion Popular has pretty much been strong-armed into the mold of a democratic party, the rascals of JAP are constantly causing us scandals and crises with their clashes with liberals and socialists. The movement’s current head, José María Valiente Soriano, is a known traditionalist, and has even been accused of secretly harbouring Carlist sympathies in the past. His traditionalism has particularly hampered the moderation of JAP, as he turns a blind eye to any bloodshed of former republicans, and some within AP believe that he is coordinating attacks to further his own agenda. However, due to his tenure as the movement’s leader and strong connections to the original leadership of AP, it would be costly to remove him. But should we choose to do so, a likely successor in the form José María Pérez de Laborda has already been chosen by AP’s leadership. The decision won’t be easy, but it could finally bring an end to the stubborn struggle of japistas. "

sprd.130.d:0 "As PNE's stewardship of Spain continues, the party has begun to see itself transform to fit its new role. While originally a big tent party of various right-wing ideologues, drawing its support from rural agrarian peasants, anti-syndicalist militants and radical  Catholic clergymen, the party now spends about as much time balancing these interests as it does forming policies and creating laws. The prime minister Albiñana finds this situation untenable, as it stretches the party thin and causes internal conflicts that are easily exploited by its main rivals, socialists of PSOE and the liberals of Izquierda Española and Union Española. A small-scale congress has been called among party elites to finally settle the ideological differences and create an unified structure. After all, a party calling for Spain to unite as whole is laughable if it cannot unify itself first. As the congress begins, several blocs form within it. Among the most influential is the Legionaries of Albiñana, who propose following the Romanian and Italian Legionary model but form-fitting it to the conditions of Spain. This would see the movement pay lip service to democracy while pursuing its policies of heavy nationalism, militarization and political repression of undesirable influences on Spanish "nature".\n\nThey are opposed by the Christian democratic wing, which calls for the movement to adopt policies championed by various Spanish Catholic parties, but with an even firmer grip and vision than those parties usually contain. Highly monarchist and pro-clergy, it would see the movement transition into a more traditionalist position, and likely cause the integration of various smaller Christian democrat parties, such as Partido Agrario, into our movement.\n\nHowever, there is one more faction within PNE that champions the adoption of a very specific brand of Catholic nationalism, the Mexican Synarchism, which would likely see our movement take a rather autocratic turn. While it would likely not be impossible to utilize this form of ideology inside a democratic system, something PNE must at least attempt to adhere to, it would mean large compromises to function. Lastly, something Albiñana himself supports, is the ideological drift towards Hispanism, something he himself became familiar with during his time in Mexico. While that particular idea is mostly a Latin American one, Albiñana argues that ideas from that movement could be applied to the Spanish setting just as well. Doing so would likely increase Spain's interest in the former colonies, although what shape this interest would take remains to be seen. It would also likely strengthen the anti-regionalist wing of PNE. The congress discussed these issues at length, but ultimately one side emerges victorious."

sprd.131.d:0 "Shortly after their victory in the elections, in fact right in the middle of PNE's lavish ceremony to celebrate their triumph, the king of Spain summoned the party leadership and upcoming ministers to an audience with the monarch. The new government may have expected a warm welcome given PNE's overt monarchism, but the king and his advisers raised their demands almost immediately after a short congratulatory note. PNE's history with paramilitary action and terror tactics against political opponents were denounced by the king. He proclaimed that now the party had entered into mainstream politics and was responsible for Spain's governance, it would have to moderate its rhetoric and means to achieve political goals. According to the king and his advisors, they would not allow for such barbaric street clashes and polarization as Alfonso XIII had done, for Spain had nearly been destroyed twice by it.\n\nFor the good of the monarchy and Spain itself, the party would have to seek a compromise between its firebrand agenda and the democratic system, or else it would lose credibility in the eyes of the king and his people. Albiñana was quick to assure the king that while PNE was committed to its program, it would make necessary adjustments needed for stability of the realm. The Legionaries of Albiñana would return to their original purpose as the party leader's personal bodyguards. Similarly, Albiñana's initial plan was to focus on its less controversial policies first, such as implementation of the corporatist system, agrarian reforms, education reform to expand access of middle and lower class students to higher education and the strengthening of church status. The king seemed to agree with these notions for now, though Albiñana was certain that the King's secret service would keep an eye open for their activities. Still, if moderation was temporarily needed for PNE's transformation of Spain, then it would have to do for the time being."

sprd.132.t:0 "The Agrarian Expansion"
sprd.132.d:0 "It is no secret that PNE draws most of its support from the countryside, from the pious and humble folk of Spain’s heartlands. Yet these folks do not exclusively support our party, their support also going to the blasted socialists of FNTT, the accursed anarchists of CNT-FAI and the primordial enemy of all true monarchists, the Carlists. While we can only hope that these lost souls find their way to the light one day, there are other parties more aligned with our ideology that could be integrated into PNE. Probably the most important would be Partido Agrario, a small party in the large-scale Spanish politics but still highly important, especially in local level. They have also historically been willing to ally with the Carlists, especially during the republican era, so absorbing them into our organization would starve the wounded Carlists of one more ally.\n\nOf lesser significance are the Derecha Regional Agraria and Peña Blanca, first being a group of agrarians and Christian democrats representing the national part of the regional party, Derecha Regional Valenciana and the second being a group of wealthy landowners and traditionalist monarchists. While these two parties are not massive by any means, the populist approach of DRA and the wealth of PB’s members would serve our cause well. However, some of the members of Pena Blanca are known to be associated with the extremely radical monarchist faction, Renovacion Espanola, and associating with them could bring the ire of the more moderate republicans on us. Similarly, DRA is in turn possibly too moderate for our party, causing us to slip closer to the compromising Christian democrats. Though some within our party have also argued that should we integrate DRA, it could serve as a facade to our commitment to democracy, allowing our more militant wing to continue their actions against the insidious forces seeking to corrupt the Spanish spirit."

sprd.133.t:0 "Theory of Hispanidad"
sprd.133.d:0 "As PNE grows into the role of the steward of Spain’s right-wing movements, we have attracted many prominent right-wing thinkers from other parties, such as Eduardo Callejo de la Cuesta and Pedro Sainz Rodríguez, as well as the monarchist generals Antonio Aranda and Luis Orgaz Yoldi, joining us mostly from the monarchist parties Union Monarquica Nacional and Accion Espanola. However, probably the largest influence to our movement has been Ramiro de Maeztu, known theorist of Hispanidad, a set of central characteristics of the Hispanic race. While de Maeztu has been forced to tone down his rabid anti-democratic rhetoric upon joining the party, due to PNE’s attempt to hold at least a facade of adhering to democracy, his ideas of Hispanidad have been instrumental in the party’s direction ever since the theorist joined us.\n\nThe main tenets of his beliefs are outlined in the book released in 1934, Defensa de la hispanidad, where he argues that Spanish, and in more general terms, Hispanic peoples, must return to ‘pure Spanishness’. In de Maeztu’s words this means a spiritual connection between Spain and its former colonies, not guided by the false gods of liberalism and rationalism but the indomitable Spanish spirit, bolstered by his own take on the French revolutionary slogan ‘liberty, equality, fraternity’ being replaced with ‘duty, hierarchy, and humanity’. The Catholic faith and mission is also very heavily visible in his theories, seeing Catholic teachings of hierarchy, charity and humble servitude as a counterpoint to the isolating and selfish ideals of the Western individualist liberalism. His critics have in turn attacked him for being only half-Spanish himself, as his mother was British, and yet more have considered de Maeztu’s inclusion into PNE problematic due to his sister, Maria de Maeztu’s activities with feminism and liberalism. Still, his theories are far too important to our movement to pass up, and as de Maeztu approached Prime Minister Albiñana directly, it was impossible for the latter to decline the offer of such a prolific right-wing ideologue."

sprd.134.d:0 "Unión Patriótica, the party created in support of general Miguel Primo de Rivera’s regime and soon absorbed to be the sole party of the dictatorship, has long been an inspiration to the Spanish right. Sad reality is that the union was unsuccessful in its aims to create an apolitical movement aimed solely at uniting the Spanish people on the fundamentally excellent values of Catholicism and corporatism. Yet from seeds of failure PNE must grow a new union, following in the values of Primo de Rivera into a new dawn, even if minor concessions must be made towards the whining voices of former republicans, who still cling to democracy as if it could save Spain.\n\nUnder the king’s watchful eye, we will attempt to merge the values of Unión Patriótica in a new way, creating local branches of PNE that will allow it to fit local conditions better, while still supporting the core values of our ideology. This new direction, partially inspired by the Carlists in its function given Albiñana’s fascination with traditionalism, will focus on the core ideals of country, religion and monarchy as the pillars of Spanish society. However, one part where our new party structure will differ from the original ideals of Unión Patriótica is in the continued utilization of Albiñana’s Legionaries.\n\nWhile majority of the movement will consist of ‘neutral men of pious faith and good ideas’, Albiñana’s Legionaries will always be there, in the shadows, preying on any socialist or syndicalist guerillero who dares to intervene in the creation of a pure, loyal Spanish state. Another idea taken directly from the original ideas of Primo de Rivera is the recreation of Somatén, a rural defence force especially in Catalonia that will ensure the rights of property owners and punish the eternal threat of Marxist infiltration into our loyal farmer folk."

To have been born as a Spaniard is the greatest honour one can have, and true Hispanism must be protected from those that would seek to shatter the unity. PNE has always stood at the forefront of neo-traditionalism, leaving behind the shackles of past that the Carlist cling onto, while revering Spain’s sacred institutions and traditions to the greatest extent. After all, few nations can claim such a glorious legacy as the mighty Espana. And yet, despite all this, despite all the glories our nation has created and achieved, even in our beloved Iberia the separatist rot gnaws at Hispanic unity and purity. The Basques, supposedly an ancient race yet to our eyes, just a relic of the past, still retain their outdated language and customs. At the very least they have seen the good graces of God and follow Catholicism almost as fervently as any loyal sons of Spain.\n\nBut whereas Basques have some redeeming qualities, in the land of the Catalans, there is little of such notions to be found. These fools claim that they have a right to a Catalan nationhood, yet have never existed as an independent nation, only ever as a part of Spain and its numerous smaller kingdoms. Their most radical members even hatched the sinister plot to murder beloved king Alfonso XIII and almost succeeded, going mostly unpunished until now. This, simply cannot stand. The Basque and Catalan nationalists will be destroyed or assimilated, their leaders imprisoned or driven to exile. Already, Carabineros and Guardia Civil troops are being directed to these areas to drive the separatists out, and they will be assisted by our excellent Legionaries as well as the newly established Somatén of Catalonia. Their rot will never again spoil a single harvest of Spain’s finest, and not a single loyal son of Spain will be lead to separatist delusions.

In truth, the reformation of the movement from street thugs fighting strikers and socialist agitators into the only traditionalist democratic party in Spain has not been an easy one, as the Legionaries constantly feel sidelined by the politicians and civilians. This isn’t helped by Albiñana’s calls for moderation within their ranks. The Legionaries were originally described as Albiñana to be ‘citizen volunteers with direct, fulminating and expeditious intervention in any act that threatens or depresses the prestige of the country’, so it is not surprising that as their actions are more moderated and constrained, the men are getting restless.\n\nIn order to stop these young, active and energetic men from jumping ship to some other radical movements, such as Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, we must find them some enemies to fight, especially given our precarious position in the public eye. In the past, the Legionaries caused many victories for the traditionalist cause, defeating Catalan nationalists, socialists and liberals alike, but as many of these forces have now become our parliamentary rivals, attacking them in such a brash manner would sour our image in the public eye.\n\nAs we have to play by the soft playbook of parliamentary politics, at last for now, the targets for Legionaries must instead be those of the radicals. We could break relations with the Carlists, who we have so far been quite close to, and gain support from the liberals and Alfonsine monarchists, but this would cause us to lose a political ally otherwise. Similarly, we can focus on the radical socialists and anarchists of CNT-FAI, and crush these insolent terrorists once and for all. Final option is to divert the Legionaries to combat Catalans, Basques and Galicians who seek to gain their independence from Spain, but this would mean leading the men away from the heartland of Spain and make them temporarily unavailable to use against other political opponents."

We alone have uplifted Spain from its stupor, raising it on its own two knees, where the Spanish folk could finally realize their inner potential and the superiority of the Hispanic spirit. The values of nation, religion and monarchy are now instilled in every institute of Spain, leading the nation according to traditional values when need be, while adopting some new innovations that will only make us stronger in the end. Never have we been so well-protected than under the ever vigilant watch of the Legionaries, who stand to thwart any plot by the separatists or socialists.

After returning to Spain, our leader became politically involved and devoted much of his time to that, but the old feud resurfaced in his mind from time to time. Now that news have reached Spain about Plutarco Calles’ takeover, Albiñana cannot shake the feeling of the idea gnawing at his mind, and as he has confided to his aides about it, some have suggested that we prepare an expedition to rid Mexico of the tyrant once and for all.

The administrator slowly went through the passports of the passengers, scribbling the occasional note to his documentation before nodding and handing back the passes. Three of the passengers received a stern look from the middle-aged man, before he turned towards the policemen and had the men arrested. Rest of the passengers, a rag-tag group of middle-class businessmen, aristocratic men in fine suits, an assortment of individuals dressed in working-class fatigues and even a couple military officers with medals on their uniforms, were let through, some glancing at the arrested men and pondering what their fates would be. Similar scenes happened all across Spain, as the exiled republicans returned to their homeland from their hideouts in North and South America, colonial Africa or European nations. Among these men were republican icons such as Manuel Azaña, Niceto Alcala-Zamora, Alejandro Lerroux, Jose Ortega y Gasset, Julian Besteiro, Miguel Maura, Diego Martinez-Barrio and Ramon Franco.

However, after a loaded exchange of platitudes and empty compliments, the king decided to cut to the chase and commented that while he was not a fan of the syndicalists, the monarchy had decided to stand behind the democratic system and as long as Partido Sindicalista would respect it as well, they would work together. Pestaña and his ministers approved these terms, and the two, ideologically almost diametrically opposed actors, begun drafting ways for the cooperation to work.\n\nOne of the major talking points was the foreign policy of the new Spain, and the king's council made it clear that any attempts to join the Third Internationale would lead to a complete destruction of this ceasefire between PS and monarchy, causing the mobilization of all Spanish reactionaries against this threat. The members of Partido Sindicalista approved this request as well, an easy decision given the members of Third Internationale already saw them as traitors given their more liberal current of syndicalism. The negotiations between syndicalists and monarchist continued long into the night, but eventually all the finer details of this new agreement were honed out.

However, dreams of an united Iberia, one where the division of two nations would be washed away and their cultures unified under one banner, are nothing new. Closest example of these dreams was during the First Spanish Republic, when the idea of a federal Spain gave way to even more grandiose ideas of Iberian federation. These never came to fruition, and this sense of an unified peninsula were forgotten in part after the wave of Hispanism that rose to the forefront after the loss of Cuba and Philippines in 1898. But while Spanish reactionaries and imperialists desperately hanged on to misplaced imperial legacy, among the ranks of the anarchist FAI and its youth division, Federación Ibérica de Juventudes Libertarias, Iberism gained some ground, even leading to talks with their Portuguese comrades, though the lack of enthusiasm from Portugal did put a damper on the spread of Iberism there.\n\nNow, however, with Partido Sindicalista guiding Spain, some within our movement have resurrected the idea of an united Iberia, even though the form this would take differs greatly from the ideas of FAI. While this idealism was originally not considered worth pursuing, given the hesitancy of PS’ leadership to participate in wars, the tyrannical rule of the Portuguese monarchy and increasing shift towards totalitarianism has made many question whether we can allow such an affront to all democratic values to occupy the peninsula. The king has offered his support should PS pursue Iberism and prepare for a conflict with Portugal, though whether we fully embrace the idea and unite Iberia or simply topple the reactionary monarchy of Portugal is up to Pestana."

While the new constitution helped weaken the grip of the church on the matters of state, Pestana and other politicians of the party have called for increased process towards total secularization of Spain. Now that PS achieved dominance over Spanish politics, this vision of a Spain set free of the greatest gatekeeper towards true liberation is set in motion.\n\nEducation will be entirely removed from the grasp of the church, large portions of church wealth will be confiscated and directed towards actual charity and not the robbery disguised as ‘support for the faithful’ the church pushes, and the Jesuit order, the vipers rotting the Spanish foundation with their poison, will be expelled. CNT-FAI rebelled against the church and burned their properties, becoming a favourite scapegoat for the authorities. Now that we have actual legal means for dealing with the church, we can right the wrongs they’ve pushed upon the Spanish people for centuries, the crimes of the Inquisition and the corruption of the clergy finally avenged.

However, there are those who still decry the outdated attitudes of CNT and FAI, especially among the women who would otherwise support these movements. When Spain was reaching boiling point in 1936, a group of CNT-FAI supporters, namely Lucía Sánchez Saornil, Mercedes Comaposada, and Amparo Poch y Gascón, formed Mujeres Libres, an organization meant to pursue what they considered the second goal of anarchist revolution in Spain.\n\nThese women think that as the anarchist revolution brings forth a society without state control and capitalist oppression, it should also liberate women from antiquated gender roles and paternalistic attitudes of men. While this liberation has often been mentioned in anarchist literature and theories, actual commitment to it in the ranks of CNT-FAI and its FIJL youth wing has been dubious. As such, Mujeres Libres drives the vanguard of anarchist liberation of women, and given the passivity of CNT-FAI, we could possibly gain the votes of Mujeres Libres if we fully committed to the cause of gender equality. Some have even suggested contacting the Mujeres Libres leadership and offering full integration into Partido Sindicalista, as equal partners."

sprd.145.d:0 "The painful reality of today is that Spain, as it stands, is left behind from the train of progress. Our nation is so incredibly outdated both in cultural, economical and educational terms that many of our former colonies in the New World will soon overtake us in some regards. Illiteracy has yet to be stomped out, with twenty-five percent of Spaniards still lacking the ability to read and more yet not knowing how to write. With women, this is even worse, with the average women’s literacy being roughly sixty percent country-wide and dipping into sub-thirty percent in regions such as the Basque country. As we seek to destroy the Church control on education, new alternatives for schools and literary programs must be looked into.\n\nPartido Sindicalista’s background as a former members of the CNT-FAI have given them some ideas as to how this is to be done, as CNT-FAI has for quite some time organized grassroots classes and clubs for the workers to learn new skills, most importantly reading and writing. If we were to adopt this model and give it actual funding but no further state control, it could lead to an actual difference in literacy levels. These organizations could then further promote decentralization of the state and creation of local level communities for other causes as well, such as laying the groundwork for unions, co-operatives and other forms of worker self-organization."

sprd.146.d:0 "When we triumphed in the elections, Spain practically erupted in hysteria and paranoia. The reactionaries of Renovacion Espanola and Traditionalist Communion as well as moderates of Accion Popular claimed that Spain would fall to Communard syndicalism, and only the defensive statements of the king and moderates committed to democracy kept Spain from falling into chaos and civil strife again. Today, after all our programs have been launched, it is clear that Partido Sindicalista has proven the fearmongers wrong. While they may not agree with our policies, we have remained faithful to the new democratic values of Spain, and the restraint with which Pestana and other members of the party have shown during these last months has even caused worldwide discussion of how Possibilism can walk the tightrope of anarcho-syndicalist ideals, liberal democratic realities and most importantly, the utter paradox of a syndicalist Spain lorded over by a monarch.\n\nOver the border, the French communards see us as little more than traitors to the cause, but we can stand proud in the fact that we have, truly, made this paradox work, and through our actions, Spain has entered a new era of true freedom, equality and progress."

sprd.147.d:0 "We have triumphed in the elections, but this is merely a start of our troubles. To be frank, Pestaña never expected this victory, as while many among the now largely defunct CNT-FAI joined his party, they were still in many ways smaller than even some of the centrist parties. However, PS's  last few rallies gathered enough support to propel the newcomer party to victory, but now it must face a difficult dilemma. Many within PS demand significant changes in Spain, but pushing too hard for reforms at such an early level could cause Spain to collapse into a civil war, something that was so narrowly avoided not long ago. As such, while many radicals within PS call for a complete social revolution and toppling of the monarchy, Pestaña and the party leadership have focused their efforts instead on making economic reforms with the help of syndicalist unions, utilizing the literary clubs of CNT-FAI to spread education among workers and completely rehauling the rural and naval industries, where PS's main support base is working in.\n\nNew coalition has been formed with PSOE, Izquierda Española and Union Española, which will help the small majority PS has immensely.Already, alliances with the anti-clerical parties are being struck to hammer in new legislation, further curtailing church grip on the rural population. Criminal justice is being rehauled to be more democratic, and party envoys have been sent to Izquierda Española and PSOE to further coordinate labour law developments, and while the party must make massive compromises when it comes to combating capitalists, PS is however proposing massive changes among both rural and urban workers. It remains to be seen if the new party can push its heavily syndicalist program against its caqiquismo and clerical enemies, but so far moral in the party remains high."

sprd.148.d:0 "Few expected CNT-FAI, one of the most important actors in Spain's political scene, to simply fall apart, but that appears to be the case. After their loss in the "mandate' elections of 1937, the movement seemed to honour the agreement at first, but parts of CNT and FAI eventually regressed back into using terror tactics against their class enemies. However, given the electoral success of moderate socialists in PSOE, and their shown ability to achieve many rather radical reforms without revolutionary means, there are those within CNT-FAI who have become disillusioned to the extreme methods of the party and union. Ángel Pestaña and his followers inside the political movement have published the so-called Manifiesto de los Treinta, which condemned these means and called for the party to instead focus its attention to obtaining legal credibility.\n\nHe stressed the successes of PSOE in similar strategy, and as a long-time advocate for CNT-FAI to become a true political party as well as first-hand witness to the horrors of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia decades ago, his words managed to convince many in the ranks of the anarchists. While  many hardliners will not accept this shift, a considerable bulk of CNT-FAI members have joined the new Partido Sindicalista, Pestaña's new party. The new party has announced that it will run in the coming elections, and while not a forerunner for election winner, they may have a chance at victory if enough anarchists abandon their previous anti-political attitude and turn up to the polls to support their parliamentary comrades. Right-wing parties, principally Accion Popular, Derecha Regional Agrario and the Carlists have condemned them as agents of Communards, but the king and most of Cortes have allowed them to run as part of the democratic process, especially considering how it weakens the terrorist side of CNT-FAI."

Despite quite a bit of insults and threats being shared between Gil-Robles and the most fervent Republicans, namely Azaña and Lerroux, the talks were successful in negotiating the terms of a new constitutional framework that could possibly see Spain transform into a true constitutional monarchy. This has not been seen as a particularly joy-filled occasion by either the republicans nor the monarchists, but both sides have seen just how close Spain was to total collapse, and are willing to work together to avoid such a scenario. The question of more radical left-wing parties will be determined later, but for now, the republican parties have given their tacit support to the regime, and eagerly await the upcoming elections promised by AP representatives."

It is this disunity that often makes us forget the father of Spanish socialism, Pablo Iglesias. The unshakeable resolve of Pablo led the Spanish socialists from the founding of PSOE under him and his comrades all the way to the de Rivera dictatorship. Iglesias Posse had to endure prison, poverty and repression for his beliefs, and despite his humble upbringing, produced the theoretical and conventional background to Spanish socialism through his sheer dogged determination towards worker’s liberation and massive productivity in written works.\n\nPablo Iglesias Posse exemplifies the qualities of a truly conscious Spanish worker, and despite all the differences of ideological orientation that Spanish left-wing activists today possess, we should all unite in celebrating the achievements of Iglesias. As PSOE celebrates its electoral victory, the party leadership has also unveiled a plan to make the birthday of Iglesias Posse into a national holiday, a kind of second First of May, to remember the difficulties Spanish labour faced in its long struggle for worker’s rights, and the men that made it possible."

sprd.151.d:0 "With PSOE’s victory in the second Spanish elections, many socialist thinkers have started to question whether the time is ripe to fully topple the monarchy and establish a Spain for the working man alone. Others, notably Julian Besteiro himself, have stressed the importance of moderation, highlighting the notable improvements in stability, individual rights and even economic growth that have slowly creeped back into Spain after the horrible anarchy and chaos of the mid-1930s. Still, PSOE was deeply divided between these two battlelines for revolution or continued evolution.\n\nOnly the intervention of a deeply surprising figure helped dissipate the tension, as the former staunch revolutionary and admirer of Russian Bolsheviks, Luis Araquistáin, came forth to press the importance of cooperation between Spanish socialists, former republicans and moderate monarchists. He commented that only the peaceful adherence to democracy and curtailment of radical rhetoric will save Spain from another dictatorship or even worse, a full-scale civil war. While in no way a monarchist, Araquistáin considers the monarchy as a necessary concession to the monarchists to maintain the democratic system.\n\nThese statements immediately made Araquistáin enemy number one for the revolutionaries within PSOE, but his rhetoric and call for peace convinced many moderates to take a far more dogged stance on the defense of moderation, and even turned some of the more radical PSOE members into adopting a more moderate stance. PSOE is not fully free of tensions, of course, but this newfound commitment to democracy has earned praise from the more centrist parties as well as the king himself."

sprd.152.d:0 "Julian Besteiro has long stood as one of the most moderate socialists within PSOE, something which has earned him even titles such as ‘the Spanish Menshevik’ and made many question whether the man is even a socialist or not. Besteiro has been an admirer of Karl Kautsky for a long time, and while he did support Russian Revolution due to considering it the only option besides chaos, his opinions on a socialist revolution in Spain have been very different. Like Kautsky, Besteiro considers a socialist revolution and a dictatorship of the proletariat to be a childish fantasy, and the syndicalist model of Union of Britain or the French Commune to be incompatible with Spain’s meager industrial base and highly polarized unions.\n\nForming his ideological basis from Revisionist Marxist, Krausist and positivist currents, Besteiro instead believes that Spanish socialists must use the tools of the current democratic system to their advantage, to improve the economic and social conditions of the Spanish workers and peasants, and so that one day the society is ready advance to a socialist system thoroughly. The electoral participation and victories of PSOE inside the democratic system have further strengthened the right-wing of PSOE led by Besteiro. More radical figures such as Largo Caballero and Indalecio Prieto hold considerable amount of support, it is clear that Besteiro’s vision for the party is increasingly becoming the dominant one."

Yet now, mere half a decade later, Spain is prosperous, stable and most of all, beginning a societal healing that will finally leave behind the dark days of military rule. Spanish democracy has flourished, and in part our policies have made Spain more equal and conscious of the issues our poorest folk face on a daily basis. Our party has united under the vision of Besteiro, bringing German ideals of a moderate, parliamentary socialism that will one day lead Spain into socialism through step-by-step reform, not violent revolution.\n\nWhere once we were considered a red menace that would swallow Spain and turn it into dictatorship of the workers, today we are trusted partners, or at least respected rivals, to the liberals and conservatives of the Cortes. Even the monarchy has accepted us as a partner despite our differing views on various political matters. The stormy days, which for years engulfed Spain and threatened to submerge it under the flood of political violence, have finally come to pass."

sprd.154.t:0 "Approaching Moderate Syndicalists"
sprd.154.d:0 "When the republic was proclaimed in 1931 and the oppressive dictatorship was finally overthrown, something within the anarcho-syndicalist movement of CNT-FAI began to change. Previously, the movement had been purely revolutionary in nature, clashing with the SIndicatos Libres, Carabineros and Guardia Civil many times and seeking to one day bring the results seen in France in the aftermath of the Weltkrieg to Spain as well. But as even PSOE adopted some degree of parliamentarism, some within CNT-FAI began to question whether the aggressive rhetoric of the movement was simply harming them. SImilarly, the anti-political nature of CNT-FAI led to them not appearing in elections and thus the trade union and its sister group FAI couldn’t achieve many actual political goals outside of grassroots organization. \n\nMany within CNT began to advocate for a new direction, especially after the domination of FAI began to influence the effectiveness of CNT’s union activities. Eventually, the situation erupted with the Manifesto of the Thirty, that called for CNT-FAI to abandon its anti-political stance and to become a proper, legitimate party participating in elections and the parliamentary system. While the movement failed to shift the direction of CNT-FAI completely, these moderates did manage to cause CNT-FAI to accept the results of the recent elections, and have now pushed more heavily for the movement to stop its terror tactics. \n\nAmong these treintistas, there has even been talks about forming their own party to fully represent the Spanish libertarians and syndicalists in the democratic system, especially now that CNT-FAI has begun to radicalize once more after its election defeat. We could capitalize on this split in the movement and try to convince these moderates to cooperate with us and try to push CNT-FAI off its radicalized platform, as despite all the similar ideas we share with the anarchists, they tend to oppose us more than agree with us, making our position in charge more difficult. But should there be a more moderate section of CNT-FAI, perhaps as a coalition partner with us, more could likely be achieved by our politicians."

sprd.155.d:0 "The Spanish rural regions have not been a target of our reforms yet, but it is clear that as we expand the rights of workers and make great strides towards a more equal Spain, the difficulties of the rural peasants are not as heavily focused upon by the members of PSOE and UGT. Earlier today, members of the Federación Nacional de Trabajadores de la Tierra, UGT’s agricultural section, have protested en masse to the policies of PSOE and UGT, demanding that the government takes direct action towards the difficulties of rural people of Spain. FNTT’s support is critical to the continued governance of PSOE, and similarly earning goodwill among the rural folk would not be a bad thing considering how many of them currently support our rivals on the right, especially in Accion Popular and Partido Agrario. \n\nAs such, conceding to FNTT’s demands, the PSOE government has called for an extra session to tackle the issues. The list of issues is manifold, ranging from lack of proper farming equipment, terrible labour laws leading to excessively lengthy daily hours, poor division of land and the domination of local societies by the so called caciquismos, powerful political machines that keep the Spanish farmer constrained to their economic situation through dirty tactics. While the other issues raised by FNTT representatives will require a much larger agrarian reform, we could focus on the caciquismo for now and destroy their reign in the rural areas. While it won’t magically fix these areas, a bit of well-deserved revenge will make us more popular among the poor people of the farmer communities. Similarly, seizing assets stolen by the political machines from the people will allow us to fund local councils and institutions of FNTT so that they can actually begin making meaningful reforms."

sprd.156.d:0 "When the Russian revolution rose to destroy the imperialist and capitalist order in 1917, the Bolsheviks utilized methods that wholly betrayed the common man and exposed that even the adherents of socialist ideals cannot avoid backsliding into tyranny. While PSOE’s current leader Julian Besteiro supported the Bolsheviks in 1917 due to seeing them as the better alternative to Tsarist tyranny, it is well-known that he shares no love for hardliner communists, despising them almost as much as the right-wing autocrats and traditionalists. This stance, however, is not universally shared within PSOE, and many within the party ranks still harbour ideals close to the Marxist-Leninists despite the defeat of the Bolsheviks. When Besteiro was chosen to lead PSOE, many of these Bolshevizers, as they are known among the socialist party, went on to join other, more extreme left groups, such as the Catalan Bloque Obrero y Campesino and  Izquierda Comunista de España. Yet many still remain, centred around the socialist and communist intellectual newspaper Leviatan, which has long called for a Bolshevik-style revolution in Spain.\n\nIf we are to earn the trust of the Spanish people and finally stabilize the situation in Spain, PSOE must eradicate this thorn in its more democratically-minded faction’s side, lest we fall to factionalism and needless bickering, or strengthen the fear mongering of our right-wing rivals. This means that PSOE must persecute even some rather high-calibre members, such as Largo Caballero, who is known to sympathize the Bolshevizers. Yet while this will temporarily hurt us, it is necessary for Spain to finally find its footing and leave the political violence behind."

Then came the Primo de Rivera dictatorship and the red scare caused by French and Bolshevik revolutions. Even when the glimmer of hope came with the Second Spanish Republic, it was soon snuffed out by the Sanjurjada coup. In the following purges, Spain was thrusted back into the chaos, ignorance and intolerance to the people’s true will that had dominated it for so long. Yet, we persisted. PSOE continued fighting on, defying the military until the faithful day not long ago, when the military was forced to give in and allow Spain’s people to vote for their chosen champions.\n\nAs expected, the overwhelming majority of PSOE and its sister parties bought us the victory, but just as we had to overcome challenges in the last decades to even survive, so too have we had to fight day and night to pass the legislation and policies we want to create the truly equal and free Spain, where no commoner is looked down upon by the plutocrats and clergymen. One day, every last one of these parasites will be torn off the backs of the working men, but it will not happen without sacrifices and compromises.

UGT collaborated with the dictator, and managed to eke out an existence despite the repressive nature of the regime, but this did mean that its reputation was somewhat tarnished by this collaboration. While CNT was harshly repressed, it did gain the sympathies of those opposing the military dictatorship, and thus has utilized its anti-establishment status to draw supporters away from UGT. However, as PSOE’s status solidifies, UGT leadership has chosen to pursue even deeper ties with our party, seeking a symbiosis similar to that between CNT and FAI, hoping to regain some of its lost pride by associating even more closely with our successful party.\n\nSome within UGT have protested this as muddling union politics with government politics, while PSOE moderates see the UGT’s more radical leadership, especially the current Chairman Largo Caballero, as a threat to PSOE’s new approach. This closer cooperation would also make the more anti-establishement members of UGT uneasy, and they could drop out of the union to go join more radical left unions. Still, having a strong union on our side would allow us to utilize their mass action in support of our legislative policies."

He has historically been so heavily against these groups that many have even questioned if the man is truly a socialist at all, while others with less critical viewpoints have compared him to the Mensheviks of Russia. This has been in contrast to the famous, or infamous, Lenin of Spain, Largo Caballero, even though Caballero himself has many times collaborated with Spain’s dictators himself. Either way, the more moderate stance on socialism has earned him great praise and support, and in the recent elections he swept his more radical rivals by a very clear margin. In a Spain craving for some stability after the dark days, Besteiro has provided an alternative to radicalist demagogues.\n\nHowever, he himself is torn between various more moderate currents on socialism. While currently Besteiristas lead a large coalition of liberal socialists, Austromarxists and Kautskyites, this has proven to be somewhat of a difficult front to keep, especially in a party already struggling from division between moderates and radicals. As such, Besteiro must now decide upon a certain model of socialism the PSOE shifts towards. Clearest choice is to simply maintain democratic socialism and utilize socialist policies and tools to push policies both through trade unions and parliamentary methods.\n\nSignificant support is also provided to the Austromarxist wing of the party argues that in a nation as large and diverse as Spain, the ideas and theories towards nationalism and socialism as unifying forces between central power and minorities could work to counteract dangerous separatism and regionalist ultratraditionalists like the Carlists. Finally, Besteiro could adopt the ideology of his personal favourite socialist theorist, Karl Kautsky, who argued for socialists to adopt a strategy of achieving a transition from capitalism to socialism through working within the capitalist framework and evolving society at large towards a new system, without the need for a costly revolution."

Even though Manuel Azaña and many within our party still remember the Republic fondly, the reality of the matter is that the monarchy seems to have come to pass. Still, what the last years of democracy have reminded us of, is that Izquierda Espanola is not the party it was during the republic. With the integration of many regionalist parties, such as Esquierra Catalana and the Galician ORGA, we have slipped further to the left, and while Azaña was a committed middle-class republican in the past, the party has evolved beyond that now. We alienated our supporters years ago by trying to push left-leaning reforms on the other hand and holding back on truly embracing the workers. While we are not the socialists of PSOE by any means, we must take heed of the mistakes of the Republic and fully embrace our new role in the Spanish society.\n\nWe can still honour our roots but Izquierda must also look for new partners and new avenues of thought, to finally break free from the memories of the failed Republican projects. As such, Azaña and his ministers have announced more radical policy ideas, especially in relation to minority rights of Spain, educational reform, agrarian reform and cultural funding intended to finally break the damage done to Spanish spirit by the likes of Generation of ‘98. But if we are to push through reforms of this magnitude, then we cannot remain a small-scale bourgeois party, but must instead focus our efforts into creating true loyalty to Izquierda Espanola in the masses of people currently supporting other parties, lest they support the likes of Carlists, Catholic zealots or anarchist terrorists."

Manuel Azaña has always been a very outspoken critic of the Generation of ‘98, and now that the new generation is rising to challenge the ideals of the Regenerationist, Izquierda Espanola has pledged to support these new creators of art in their endeavors.\n\nGeneration of ‘27 has been characterized as a merging of Spain’s popular culture with the folklore of Iberia, and while this new movement is hard to break down to its essentials due to the awe-inspiring variety of styles it holds, it is generally considered to be a Spanish embracing of the avant-garde principles promoted usually in various Communards circles. Some styles followed by the Generation include Surrealism, Futurism, Cubism and Ultraism, and the forms of art that have embraced this new generational spirits appear in music, poetry, painting and literature in general, pushed onwards by such savants like Federico Garcia Lorca, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel and K–Hito.\n\nThis new form of artist expression is drawing many eyes towards Spain, especially in a time where Europe itself is focusing on wartime production and other far less artistic pursuits. Izquierda Espanola has long been a defender of Spanish art, and in our pursuit for a more widespread support base, the patronage of this new generation has already helped the party’s support."

sprd.162.d:0 "Spanish regionalists rarely find many allies in the mainline parties of Castile, as both the socialists and conservatives either ignore the regional issues or prefer creating branches of their own ideologies in regions such as Catalonia and Basque Country. However, Izquierda Espanola has historically been quite stalwart ally of regionalist party, with Manuel Azaña personally pushing heavily for the proposed Estatuto de autonomía for Catalonia, though this proposition never got off the ground because of the military coup. But now, with the dark days of Sanjurjada a mere memory, our government has decided to push this controversial statute through, with expansion to our allies in Partido Galeguista and Partido Nacionalista Vasca in Galicia and Basque country in addition to Catalan regional reform.\n\nThese autonomous regions will gain a largely independent tax system, and jurisdiction over health and welfare within their regions, with their regional languages fully accepted alongside Spanish in regional matters. While Catalans especially had hoped for a full Catalanization of the region and dropping the requirement for Spanish as an official language, it seems that the concessions have been more than enough. In order to placate regional nationalists, the use of regional flags, such as the Catalan Senyera and Basque Ikurrina, and regional anthems, such as Catalan Els Segadors, has been allowed in official use as well. While this does make Spain less centralized, it does feed into Azaña’s personal agenda to fulfill a vision of Spain that is simultaneously one and multiple, fit to the realities of the nation and not to some chauvinistic agenda of a Castilian dominance.\n\nIt has also pushed many parties that would likely otherwise support our rivals into becoming staunch allies of Izquierda Espanola, such as the Basque nationalist or Catalan Lliga Catalunya. Many within Partido Radical have protested this new statute, and Lerroux himself has called it a dangerous mistake that will simply invite separatism, but given their minority in the Cortes, there’s been little they have been able to do."

It is no secret that Izquierda Espanola has struggled heavily in this new situation, given its very clear roots in republicanism, but now that enough time has passed from the painful memory of the republic, it is clear that the new transformation of Izquierda has been a beneficial one.\n\nThe presence of the monarchy and the mistakes done during the Republic era have caused our leadership to reinvent itself to less strictly middle class party with narrow support from petite bourgeois, into a party that is more aligned with the common people. Our alliances with the more radical left-wing parties have made it possible for us to push many of the laws we wished to achieve back in 1931, and thanks to these alliances we have influenced parties like PSOE and Partido Sindicalista to adopt a more democratic form, abandoning their firebrand revolutionary rhetoric.

But after so many difficult years and so much suffering inflicted to Spain after the death of the republic, many committed Izquierda republicans have simply become tired. The exile of many republicans, the harsh military repression, the infighting between anarchists, socialists and republicans, all have amounted to very little. The embers of the republican dream still burn in their hearts, but for now, the victory is half-complete. The king has seemingly been committed to democracy within Spain, and while many within IE still abhor the thought of monarchist Spain, even they must admit that the current haven of stability in the usually volatile Spanish politics is a welcome one.

Back then, the republic had been too weak to resist, and now, Sanjurjo could simply scoff at any such pitiful attempts to purge the military. If Azaña and his band of troublemakers had been unable to dislodge the powerful Spanish military from its rightful place at the height of Republic’s power, what hope did they have now that the king was in power once more? Sanjurjo grabbed a pen from his desk, beginning to write an order to Guardia Civil to sweep the conspiratory circle of Izquierda Espanola, to root this type of nonsense before it got dangerous enough. However, the pen dropped from the general’s hand as the door was kicked in, and three heavily armed Carabineros soldiers stepped into the rooms, leveling their Star submachine guns at the officer. They were followed by two men in uniform, generals Quiepo de Llano and Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer.\n\nSanjurjo attempted to protest the intrusion, but he was quickly shut down by de Llano, who announced that Cabanellas Ferrer would be taking over as the leader of Guardia Civil starting immediately, and Sanjurjo would be escorted to a military court for his role in the 1932 uprising, especially due to his Carlist connections. As the general was grabbed by the Carabineros, he once more protested, cursing the two other officers for betraying their military brethren so callously. de Llano and Cabanellas Ferrer, known for harbouring republican sentiments, merely scowled at the officer as he was dragged out. The man who had attempted to follow in Primo de Rivera’s shoes had clearly lacked the ability that the former had possessed, the ability to slip out of Spain when the tide had clearly turned against him. Around Spain, similar arrests were carried out, the plotters of Sanjurjada disgraced and expelled from the military, receiving harsh sentiments. Even the monarchy, which they had helped restore, turned a blind eye to them, with the king remembering the role of a puppet his father had been forced into by the ruthless military junta. The greatest threat to Spanish democracy had been removed."

sprd.166.d:0 "Manuel Azaña is often called by his less than flattering nickname ‘Monster’, by his political opponents, but perhaps the time has come to redeem that nickname. With newfound vigor and purpose, Izquierda Espanola has set upon redeeming the Republic’s legacy by tackling the vast array of issues the 1931 Constitution and bills attempted to rectify. As we set upon this task, however, many within the party have noticed the difference between the Izquierda Republicana of the Republican years and the Izquierda Espanola of today.\n\nWith many former Azanistas forced into exile, particularly to the United States, many within our ranks have adopted new ideas, political positions and radical thoughtforms which differ greatly from the positions we had back during the existence of the Republic. IE has visibly shifted to the left even more than before, and while the party used to be a liberal centrist one, it is closer to the PSOE than the Radicals of UE today. As such, many prominent politicians within the party, especially those integrated from smaller parties such as Partido Galeguista and Esquerra Republicana Catalunya, have called for a party convention that would hammer home the new direction of the party. Azaña himself supports continuing the current policy of reformist capitalism, but he is also known to exhibit some authoritarian tendencies, especially when it comes to dealing with right-wing extremists, anarchists, the military and Church influence, and thus Azaña would likely support adopting an even more iron-gripped style of governance.\n\nMany of the more liberal and pacifist members of the party are disgusted by such proposals, but there are also those who support these lines of thought as necessary within the new monarchist structure. Some have however, offered a middle-ground between the capitalist and authoritarian camps, seeking to bring about American-style progressivism with a Spanish radical stint into the political field of Spain. There are also some smaller, less prominent trains of thought going on within Izquierda Espanola, with Marcelino Domingo from the recently integrated Independent Radical Socialist Party promoting liberal socialism as an alternative to PSOE’s Marxism and UE’s Radicalism. Probably the smallest but still influential group is also the Georgist members of IE and its regionalist support parties, most prominently represented by Blas Infante, who advocate for the adoption of Henry George’s famous single-tax ideology in Spain. While minor, the influence of Infante especially in Andalusia has won this small branch considerable success within IE.."

sprd.167.d:0 "As the Republic sought to fight back against the forces of traditionalism and reaction, Manuel Azaña’s Izquierda Republicana and its allies, notably Union Republicana, sought to utilize a strategy of wide popular front, comprised of left-wing parties of a immense variety of ideological strains. This alliance, while costly and sometimes incredibly cumbersome to uphold, did allow us to make sure that the right-wing parties struggled to gain a majority. Only the backbone of any reactionary action, the military, managed to snatch the reins of progress and governorship from the popular front, and even then the response from the left almost sent the country into a civil war. As Spain continues to heal, and our party has managed to return to its rightful place as the supreme rulers of Spain, the question once again returns, how to contest the ever-present right-wing reactionaries from contesting our rule? Given the existence of the monarchy and the four years of right-wing dictatorship, Spain’s culture has once again steered more towards traditionalism, and thus we must increase our efforts to pry the nation out of this rot, into a brighter dawn.\n\nThe idea of a popular front has resurfaced, and we have already sent invitations all over Spain. Most prominent parties are of course Diego Martinez-Barrio’s Union Espanola, Julian Besteiro’s PSOE and even the moderate syndicalists of Partido Sindicalista and the right-communists of Joaquin Maurin’s BOC. Progressive regionalist parties such as Vangarda Nazionalista Galego, Partido Galeguista, ORGA and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya alongside the Basque conservatives and moderate socialists in PNV and ANV respectively have clamoured to join the front as well, seeing us as their best option to enact sufficient regionalist autonomy reforms. Many former republicans, such as the leaders of the Jabali group, Ramon Franco and Blas Infante, have also endorsed the front as a necessary measure to combat the reactionaries under the monarchy. Our overwhelming support should make it easy for the Popular Front to defeat the reactionaries in future elections, although we must not become complacent even with our new political bulwark."

sprd.168.d:0 "Manuel Azaña watched the bustling city streets of Madrid from the second floor window of Palacio de las Cortes. As Spaniards hurried along to their jobs or daily tasks, the street was like a path for ants. Now that Spain’s political situation had stabilized, people had taken to the streets in a new sense of security, no longer burdened by fears of a civil war or spiraling back to the years of pistolerismo like in 1910s and early 1920s. Slowly but surely, Spain was healing, something which made even the usually muted prime minister crack a small smile. However, it quickly dissolved from his face as the red and yellow flags of the Spanish kingdom waved in the light breeze down the street, reminding Azaña that even if the threat of a Spanish collapse had been avoided, Spain was still under the grip of the monarchy. Few people in Spain had done as much to achieve the dream of a Spanish republic as Azaña, and yet all those dreams had been pummeled into the dirt by the military when the conspiracy of Sanjurjada succeeded and toppled the Second Spanish Republic. The years in exile had not been easy, seeing the dysfunctional Spanish monarchy restored and Spain’s noble people subjected to the tyranny of the military and their lackeys in Accion Popular.\n\nYet when the inevitable happened and the military was forced to give in before the storm of popular action, a small hope rekindled in the defeated Republicans, and as the exiles were amnestied, Spain saw a true resurgence of democratic will. Yet for Azaña, the situation has been difficult to adjust. A life-long republican, he has always seen the monarchy as simply incompatible with truly free, parliamentary democracy, yet as the king has granted his support for democracy and other parties have adopted a more moderate stance towards the monarchy, Azaña has had to readjust his beliefs. Even now, as he watches the royal flag of Spain wave, the ex-president of the republic can only think back to the tricolour that once waved over Madrid’s roofs, and the mass fervour of democratization that followed it. Perhaps, even under the monarchy, that spirit could be recreated, nurtured into action through Izquierda Espanola’s policies, and Spain could make the best out of the current situation. Perhaps, the true spirit of 1931 was not completely lost, but simply forgotten, waiting to be discovered once more. Azaña sighed and turned back to head into the current session of the Cortes, feeling somewhat revitalized. Spain would know progress, even under the king, if Azaña could help it."

However, the long years under the military iron boot have made Spaniards more understanding of our good message, and the Spain of today has, in many ways, begun resembling some of the ideals the old Republic could not achieve. The bloated officer corps of the army, prone to corruption, nepotism and conspiratorial reactionarism, has been purged and finally set to a course of a proper modern military, not a semi-feudal clique of rivaling knighthoods, each seeking to beat the other for monetary and political gain. The tyrant Sanjurjo has been judged before the law, and his allies in the military have not escaped our wrath. The party has evolved from a group of, at times elitist and insulated, liberals to a party of true popular action, emphasizing the active role of enlightened civilians who feel their patriotic duty both in their national service and civilian lives. While much is still left to be done for Spain to be truly free from the ever-present reactionary obscurants, the torch of liberty has been lit, and even a victory of the right-wing demagogues will not extinguish it ever again!"

sprd.170.d:0 "Spanish Republic may now just be a distant memory, but many within Union Espanola still remember the glory days of Republican unity. As years have gone by, Republican parties have evolved into different directions, with Derecha Liberal drifting towards progressive conservatism with a monarchist stint, our original allies in Partido Radical wallowing in their corruption and ideological ambiguity, and our old friends in Izquierda Republicana becoming increasingly left-wing in their rhetoric and policies.\n\nHowever, despite all the changes, the parties still contain elements of the republican spirit, and if we are to defend the newfound democracy, we could attempt to form a wide-spread coalition with the former republicans to stop the socialists and monarchists from getting any ideas. After all, even during the days of the Republic, Union Republicana was always a negotiator between the various republican parties, so perhaps the new Union Espanola can continue this legacy. Initial proposals of this idea have already gathered some positive reactions from the parties, but the question remains whether to include Partido Radical given the history between our party and Lerrouxists."

However, while the forming of this alliance was attempted, the loss of Britain and the rising authoritarianism of National French State, German Empire and various other major powers, as well as the spiral towards collapse that engulfed United States, made any plans to form a liberal internationale mere fantasy. \n\nHowever, given our increased reliance on the myth of Jacobinism and the lack of democratic radical beacons in the world, many with Union Espanola have raised the matter of perhaps forming one ourselves. After all, the fall of France and the weakness of remaining French radicals does put us as one of the strongest radical parties left in the world, but there are still many around the globe who support the ideals of the original Jacobinism. The time looks ripe for the rebirth of the Radical Entente, to fully align the world’s radicals under one banner and resist the vile autocratic monarchs and devious syndicalists.  Some critics of the idea have claimed that the proclamation of this alliance will just cause the Communards to invade us, though whether France has the means to do so in the current international situation remains questionable."

sprd.172.d:0 "So far, we have had to walk the tightrope when it came to our policy with the church. After all, policy towards the church galvanized many of the original supporters of Sanjurjada to act, and zealots such as Carlists, Integrists and other religious fundamentalists have long been enemies of democracy and people’s will in Spain. Now, however, Spanish democracy has existed for a long time, and our support has grown to the point that we may finally be able to finish off the relic holding us in the past. Martinez Barrio has announced the reinstitution of the Republican secular laws.\n\nThe Catholic Church will be barred from holding any stakes in industry or commerce, the state subsidies to clergy will be entirely cut within two years of the law passing and any religious entities that require an oath of allegiance to any other institution than the state itself will be banned entirely from the nation. This final point would mainly target Jesuits. Further investigations into church properties will be taken, and those considered unnecessary for religious use will be nationalized so that they may be used for the benefit of society. Similarly, the state will be able to veto appointments made by the church within its organization, to curtail the appointment of anti-democratic or fundamentalist clergymen. There are some limitations to the legislation we can push through, however, as the king is obviously quite heavily connected to the church, and even though the monarchy abandoned its reactionary role in previous dictatorships, the weakening of the church role is still a sore spot for them. Still, at least the new legislation will finally kick the church out of most social functions it is not needed in."

With the last divisions between Radical Democrats and Radical Socialists fading away, we’ve made Spain into a secular, progressive paradise it was always meant to be. Centuries of meddling in this process by the church, various monarchies from Bourbons to Bonapartes, and the endless moneysinks of the colonies have held Spain from achieving its true potential as a liberal world power, but bit by bit we have pulled this nation to the level of other European countries.\n\nMartinez Barrio’s moderate rhetoric mixed in with radical action to those that deserve it has led us from victory to victory. While many challenges still remain until Spain has truly fulfílled its place in the world, thanks to our actions that day is ever closer. The Republic may be dead, and we mourn it all the same, but even despite the monarchy compromise we have achieved many of the goals that seemed impossible to reach after the collapse of the Republican dream."

While we are still weak to the point of being unable to contest the rule of the church and king completely, some members of UE have proposed strengthening our Jacobinist rhetoric. After all, over the border, the meddlesome syndicalists also claim to be heirs to Jacobinism, which we wholesale reject.\n\nFanning the Francophobia that has taken hold over Spain during the primoderiverista era, we could gain support even from our rivals and enemies as few legal parties in Spain openly support the Communard regime. This support could later earn us some goodwill as we push more radical reforms, such as the secularisation of the Spanish state. As such, while many within our party leadership are not as dedicated to nationalism as their Partido Radical counterparts, in this instance we must fully leverage the anti-French rhetoric in our manifestos and political speeches. After all, Radical parties are the true, pure heirs of Jacobinism, untainted by socialist or syndicalist ideologies."

sprd.175.t:0 "Mending the Party Divide"
sprd.175.d:0 "After the unification of Partido Radical Democrata and Partido Radical-Socialista in 1934, Diego Martinez Barrio and Felix Gordón Ordás have laboured to bridge the differences these two parties have had towards policy. While both parties showed a perhaps too overzealous attitude towards achieving secularization in the past, they have now been forced to shift their perspectives towards more practical fields, such as economy and agrarian reform. This has led to some friction before the former Radical-Socialists and Radical Democrats, as while the two parties share some common ideas, especially those among the ranks of the Radical-Socialists tend to veer more to the left in economic issues. As such, a party convention has been called to fully mend party divides and choose a line that our new union must follow.\n\nThe supporters of Martinez Barrio espouse the following of Radical liberalism and moderate cooperation between parties, while the followers of Gordón Ordás promote a society built on progressive values and moderation between parties, upholding democracy as the paramount value of the entire society. This line is seen as a more conservative stance on matters than their more radical opponents within the PRRS wing of UR, who instead promote the adoption of a liberal variant of socialism. Led by Álvaro de Albornoz, this wing of the former PRRS denounces Marxism, but promotes the adoption of more radical methods inside UR, borderlining on veering into Izquierda Espanola’s rhetoric at times. They are also more willing to work with left-wing parties such as PSOE.\n\nFourth option, coming out of left field for many, is the adoption of the ideology promoted by the Czech National Socialist Party. Circulo Espanol del Praga, and it’s Spanish counterpart, La Agrupacion de Amigos de Checoslovaquia,  a collection of Czech and Spanish intellectuals and notable members of their society have long been in a cultural exchange, despite the sad state of Czech independence movement. As the republican movements of Czechia and Spain had a lot in common, our radicals naturally intermingled in these sorts of organizations, and thus many within UR are aware of the style of liberal radicalism the Czechs espouse. This “National Socialism” promoted by the likes of T.G. Masaryk and Edvard Beneš, is not massively known in Spain, but could prove to be a good common ground to unite our fragmented party around, due to its focus on civic nationalism, moderate socialism and liberal spirit."

Both of these two groups used to be part of the larger Partido Radical Republicana, led by the infamous silver-tongued demagogue Alejandro Lerroux, and the main cause for the split was the increasing caudilloism of Lerroux and his constant compromising with the right-wing parties of Spain, especially those that were clearly very pro-church in nature. Now that Union Espanola has shown itself to be the stronger of the two radical parties of Spain, we must launch a full investigation into Lerrouxist degeneracy and corruption, just to keep them on their toes and to weaken our strongest opponent. Still, this merging of PRRS and PRD has not been easy, and while we are united in cause to decimate the Lerrouxist false radicals, the frictions inside UE are beginning to mount. In order to properly fix the damage done to radicalism by those who sought to corrupt it, UE must adopt a unified vision, and do so soon."

However, the unique nature of Spain means that UE must compromise on the centralist nature of radical liberalism if we are to avoid the ire of the minorities. After all, we participated in the Pact of San Sebastian, guaranteeing the rights of Spanish minorities with our signature. Moving to a less exclusively anti-regionalist direction would probably earn us a great deal of goodwill among the minor peoples of Spain, especially as their most popular parties in turn tend to be rather pro-Republican. This move could possibly also align the various smaller sections of Lerroux’s Radicals closer to us, making integration of these autonomous parties easier when the time comes to take action towards them. While UE will never reach as strong a stance towards minorities as the Azanistas, we will implement new policies aimed at safeguarding the autonomy and cultural priviledges of the Spanish minorities.."

sprd.178.d:0 "Spanish political scene tends to be perceived only at the national level or through some select regionalist parties such as the Basque PNV or Catalan ERC, but especially since the abandonment of the two-party system and the proclamation of the republic, local-level parties have propped up at an incredible rate. Often these parties operate within a single territory of Spain, or at best in the surrounding provinces, but they nonetheless often wield such an influence that even state-level parties must pay heed to their demands. Partido Radical, our old rivals, have swayed two such parties to their side, these being the Valencian Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista and the Granadan Partido Republicano Autónomo de Granada.\n\nö PURA represents the left flank of PR’s autonomous parties, while PRAG has long tried to position themselves further from the main party due to various internal changes of Partido Radical. While they may not see eye to eye with Union Espanola on all issues, we could seek to integrate them into our organization in the future, especially as many PURA members have already joined us in the past. Another splinter of the Lerrouxist Radicals is also the small Catalan party, Partit Radical Autònom de les Comarques Tarragonines. Due to their Catalan roots, the party has slowly drifted away from Lerrouxism and into the arms of Catalan nationalists, but thanks to our evolution into less outwardly hostile party towards the Spanish minorities, we could attempt to woo this party into joining us. However, many within our party believe that if we are to absorb these smaller regional groups, it could lead to a slide towards different ideological basis, especially with the Blasquismo of PURA."

Jesuits and monastic clergy have infiltrated our school system thoroughly, and the role of the church in education is immense, with many schools being completely under church ownership. This, simply cannot stand. Union Espanola has begun a massive operation to nationalize all Catholic school, though this is not as simple as it seems. Many of our teachers are nuns or monks, and while they cannot be blamed for the nefarious plans of the Papacy and its henchmen, they must be replaced with reliable, secular teachers.\n\nThis is going to be costly, but there are ways we can cover for the costs. The moderate approach would be to slowly phase out church education as we educate new secular teachers, but this will compromise on our campaign promises and will obviously take time. The other option is to charge rent from church properties and use those funds to pay for the needed wages for teachers as well as the educational costs of training new teachers. This would likely anger the church and parties like Accion Popular, but considering our anti-clerical policies already being drafted, such as the reform to divorce laws and civil marriages, this little concession would probably not help our standing with Vatican."

Especially further right from us, some within the Accion Popular and especially among the radicals of Partido Nacionalista Español and Renovacion Espanola have protested his nomination, claiming that Spain will only relive the events of 1931-1932, with the socialists and radical liberals like Azaña seeking to dismantle Spain’s traditions and culture. They claim that the moderate stance of Alcala-Zamora only invites further radicalization, and his willingness to compromise with the left while holding conservative stances on other matters will simply lead to him becoming the Spanish Kerensky, inviting a terrible civil war because of his compromises. DLE’s supporters have struck back, claiming that it was only the compromises between republicans, socialists and even monarchists that allowed Spain to pass by the dark days of last few years, directly a result of Accion Popular’s disastrous policies. Nonetheless, even the rabid monarchist elements have a seed of truth in their ramblings, and it is true that Spanish republicans did go overboard in the fervor of liberalization in the faithful days of the Second Republic. We must learn from these mistakes and carve out a path where we can both appeal to the liberals, conservatives and moderates within our party without compromising too much with the rabid firebrands of Azanistas or Gil-Robles’ goons. DLE is the only party that can truly bring moderate progress to Spain, without the corruption of Lerrouxists or the radical ideology of the other parties. Just like Kerensky turned out to be the compromise candidate for Russia, so too shall Alcala-Zamora lead Spain into a moderate dawn, though the Spanish Kerensky shall avoid the mistakes of his namesake, and hopefully, the fate of him as well."

sprd.181.d:0 "After our defeat in 1932 during Sanjurjada, Derecha Liberal Republicana had a crisis within its leadership as Antonio Maura’s son, Miguel Maura, led a part of the party with him to form Partido Republicano Conservador. This move was primarily fueled by Maura blaming the policies of Niceto Alcala-Zamora and his close allies for destroying the republican dream by allying with socialists and liberals. Maurists instead wished to focus their efforts on the original dreams of DLR, creating a mass movement of non-confessional republicans who would ease Spaniards into the new state of things. With Spain stabilizing and DLR’s new successor, DLE, returning to conservatism with a liberal and progressive tinge, Maura has offered to rejoin our party if DLE does not continue its policy of dangerous alliances with the left. Given that Maura’s father was basically the founder of modern Spanish conservatism, having him and possibly his brother Gabriel Maura joining us instead of Accion Popular would boost DLE’s profile to previously unattainable heights. This does mean that any coalitions with Azanistas are ruled out, but we have already begun negotiations with conservative parties in the minority regions, such as Liga Regionalista in Catalonia, Irmandades da Fala in Galicia, Union Navarra in Navarre and Partido Nacionalista Vasco in Basque Country, as well as the Union Espanola of Diego Martinez Barrio, and hopefully we can form a large coalition without the need for Azaña’s support."

sprd.182.d:0 "Derecha Liberal Republicana was always balancing between its two main factions, the liberal left and the conservative, Christian democrat right, and this struggle for control within the party eventually led to its weakened position in parliamentary politics. As we have returned to the Cortes in force, this issue of just what style of conservatism our new party should follow has been raised once more. There are multiple options to choose from, the easiest one obviously being that we could simply continue our curious mix of progressive and conservative policies, seeking to create a moderately Catholic state with wide popular support. However, if we were to lean more into the masses, we could also adopt even more populist tactics to create a truly mass party, less focused on the typical liberal businessmen and academics as we now do, replacing this side with more grassroots activity. This would likely put us at odds with the Lerrouxists and Accion Popular, who focus on workers and peasants respectively, but given the radicalism of those two parties, perhaps taking part of their voter based would be good for Spain. Alternatively, we could lean even more into the liberal side of our party, seeking to empower the business sector and political elite, while still maintaining our focus on civil liberties, societal progress and slight Christian tint.\n\nYet the possibilities do not stop there, as we could also adopt the ideology of the newly integrated Partido Republicana Conservador, Maurism, named after their mentor Antonio Maura. This would see us abandon some of our more liberal principles and adopt some elements of protectionism, but it would nonetheless keep the party mostly progressive conservative in societal and economic matters. Finally, we could simply adopt Christian democracy wholesale, turning our movement more socially conservative. This shift would likely help us boost our numbers while hurting Accion Popular, which is always a nice bonus."

Spain has been tortured for so long that Spaniards themselves consider these constant crises normal, yet this must end. A political purge will be enacted within DLE to rid us of any possible warmongers and radicals, and after that, we must establish new legislation and juridical procedures to make persecuting violent or revolutionary political activists easier.\n\nSimilarly, we will use one of our best contacts in the military, Major General Carlos Blanco Pérez. He happens to be a member of our party, and has provided information to us about those military officers most likely to align with both revolutionary actors aligned with the Internationale or traditionalist fundamentalists of Renovacion Espanola and the Carlists. Another military officer, general Quiepo de Llano, has also collaborated with DLE on this matter, partly because of his former republican sympathies and partly because of him being Alcala-Zamora’s son-in-law. With these two links within the army, we can finally curtail radicalism spreading within the military, and allow us to focus our energy on political and revolutionary actors who aren’t tied to it. While these actions are not particularly popular even inside DLE, they are necessary to finally exorcize the demon of political extremism that has haunted Spain for so long."

Some, like the Basque PNV, are Christian democratic parties, who in the past supported republicans simply because of their preference for pro-autonomy policies. Now, as DLE gathers steam after the electoral victory, we could capitalize on the differences between IE and its regional allies. As DLE has leaned more into pro-Catholic policies, many local parties are seeking to align with us, but they are cautious on whether we support their calls for autonomism or prefer centralism in Spain. Centralization is preferred by many monarchists and nationalists in Spain, but it would be an understatement to say that they dislike us, so we would likely not lose much by pursuing more autonomist policies.\n\nPreliminary talks with PNV and the Catalan right-wing parties such as Liga Regionalista and Unio Democratica de Catalunya have been promising, and large Galician parties such as Dereita Galeguista and Partido Galeguista have also contacted us offering support in exchange for preferential policies. This would allow us to dislodge Azaña’s party as the leader of pro-autonomism, and given the Spanish Radical parties’ preference for centralization, they would likely not gain many votes from the minorities either. As such, the party leadership has decided to focus on legislation that would support the culture and rights of Spanish minorities, especially after so many years of oppressive military crackdowns and Castilian cultural chauvinism. Thus, these new policies are basically just one more step on our road to becoming a true mass party for all Spaniards."

However, as it currently stands, the monarchy was restored and while many within the party still hold up hopes that it could be destroyed and the monarchist flags torn down, the truth is that for the time being, the republican tricolor is not going to fly over Spain any time soon.\n\nAs surprising as it may be Niceto Alcala-Zamora and other members of the party, such as Miguel Maura, used to be monarchists once. While they abandoned those convictions due to the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and the disgraceful abandonment of the Spanish people by the monarchy that happened during those years, they have now warmed up towards the monarchy thanks to the new constitutional transformation of it and renewed commitment to democracy.\n\nIt is clear that DLE will most likely never match the sheer monarchist ferocity of Accion Popular or Renovacion Espanola, our monarchism will be tempered, pragmatic and most importantly, fiercely democratic, something that even the most moderate Accion Popular members could not claim in all honesty. With the DLE’s republicanism kept under a lid or possibly completely extinguished, the party will nonetheless push through the policies of the original republican dream, just fit for the new system."

In a peninsula filled to the brim with tyrants, radicals, terrorists and separatists, a seed of hope has been slowly nurtured, our moderate policies allowing it slowly recover and grow to its full potential, and now, the Spanish Kingdom stands united.\n\nThe dark years, or more accurately, decades, have finally been redeemed, with the painful memories slowly fading and the scars disappearing. Without DLE’s firm but gentle hand, Spain may have very well fallen into a nosedive towards a civil war despite all the compromises and victories of 1936 and 1937. But DLE has managed to pacify those elements of the Spanish society that would not see reason, and moderate those that could. With our politics slowly but surely turning less and less polarized, Spain’s democracy may finally be allowed to thrive and grow, to reach its full potential as it was always meant to be.

As such, Spain has never truly seen a proper, democratic constitutional monarchy, where parties are free to take part in elections and compete against each other in a truly parliamentary way. Neither was there really a party calling for such a thing while also advocating for the monarchy, if we discount the accidentalist mindset of the Republic-era Spanish right. But under the transformative leadership of Niceto Alcala-Zamora and his strong allies under Miguel Maura, Spain has seen this style of governorship finally become possible, as the party expands its ranks with new, young patriots, seeking progress alongside the long traditions of the monarchy and the moderate democratic process. Thanks to our efforts, the Spanish people are getting more and more used to democracy and its characteristics, and slowly, it is developing into something that political parties across the isle see as fundamental part of our society.

As Spain develops to a shining beacon of liberal democracy in Europe, around the world’s nations this is far from the norm. The Entente is slowly slipping to autocracy, the American peoples’ are tearing each other apart, the German order is far from a paradise of democracy and the Syndicalists themselves have violently overthrown their rightful governments, and harbour dangerous radicals like Mosley, Mussolini and Valois. In Asia, Japan seeks to dominate the poor Chinese, destroying any sense of unity they could possibly achieve.\n\nBleakness of today’s world is on a level that is completely unacceptable to DLE’s leadership, and while far from the most jingoistic Spaniards, our party leadership understands that Spain must serve its role in the liberation of the world from the shackles of tyranny, be it reactionary or revolutionary. While we prepare the Spanish nation to take a more active part in this fight for freedom, liberty and democracy, we must create the means to defend Spain’s borders from any incoming force. Extensive fortifications will be constructed in the Basque country and Catalonian border with France, and reserve units will be circulated along the Spanish coast in preparation for a naval invasion.\n\nThe Spanish people must stand ready to face the storms of the world, for the protection of liberty and our free system is of utmost importance. Factories like Star, Llama and Oviedo Mauser plants will be churning out guns, ammunition and other military equipment for domestic use, but we will also create a program aimed at supplying friendly regimes in their conflicts, for if they fall, our fall will be more likely as well. And finally, a clandestine group of volunteers and military experts will be assembled to provide direct intervention forces, mostly working without national symbols, to help our allies overseas against dictators and power-hungry madmen.

Yet, we have been more successful at promoting truly democratic monarchism to the masses, as AP’s actions during the dictatorship showed their true colours to many Spanish right-wing monarchists. This has driven many minor parties, such as the agrarian parties Unión Castellana Agraria, Acción Agraria Riojana, the more traditionalist yet somewhat progressive Dereita Galeguista and Unión Navarra and the numerous smaller liberal centrist parties, such as Partido Republicano Liberal Demócrata, Partido Republicano Autónomo Navarro and Partido del Centro Democrático, into seeking an alliance or perhaps outright integration into our party. While this could help bolster out ranks and allow us to more easily defeat Accion Popular on the battlefield of parliamentarism, it would also cause our party to be ripped into different directions without considerable reorganization. As such, while many see integration of these parties as the utmost task of DLE at the moment, yet others, Miguel Maura among them, urge for caution.

Through our resolute but gentle action, Spanish people are more committed to the values of democracy than ever before, and many of those who once sought to bring Spain to a civil war and revolution have calmed their rhetoric and joined us on the parliamentary stage as rivals, not as violent enemies. Spanish culture, economy and academia blossoms as the violence of the last few years fades away, and for the first time in ages, the atmosphere of fear has vanished, replaced by a sense of pride and hope for the future, of a Spain made anew by the actions of responsible governance. While the current world order fluctuates, Spain must find its own place among it, but for now, we stand ready for the challenges the global politics will throw our way. Spain is united, moderate and stable, and for now, DLE can enjoy its place at the forefront of this change. However, as our party has continued to evolve, many have accused us of harbouring elitist sentiments, not helped by the rather laissez-faire outlook on economics that many within DLE hold. As the party attracts new blood into its ranks, many within the press and academic field have observed that DLE has slowly started shedding some of the more elitist members, both due to natural progression and partially as a concentrated appeal from DLE leadership. How this will shape the party remains to be seen, but it is certainly changing the landscape of its internal politics dramatically."

While the old king recovered from his coma, he was wise enough to not contest the rule of his son, who has proven to be far more adept at seeing things as they are. As the current monarch is less blind to the issues of average Spaniards, or at the very least is attempting to care about them, DLE has decided to support the royal house fully, though less fervently as our rivals in the Accion Popular or Partido Nacional Espanola. Just as the monarchy still has long ways to go before the average Spaniards starts viewing them with less contempt, so does DLE have to go through quite a bit of internal restructuring to adjust to this new pro-monarchy stance, even when it comes to old monarchists like Niceto Alcala-Zamora. Nonetheless, should the monarchy receive the support of a former republican party, it would likely heighten its changes at being recognized as legitimate in the eyes of Spain’s people, though even then we must understand that the process of reconciliation will take time, and the republican flame may never be truly extinguished. Nonetheless, just as the king is committed to democratic principles now, we too must be committed to the new monarchist direction Spain has taken."

The path ahead to reconquer that which has been lost to time and rivaling powers will take time, but as Spain steams ahead, seemingly recovering from the dark days of the past, Accion Popular continues to grow to its role as the citadel of Spain’s monarchism. Other parties may nibble at our support base, but this will only make us stronger as it removes those of little faith from our ranks. Already, Spaniards are becoming more charitable and caring for those in need, abandoning the greed of unfettered capitalism and the false promises of syndicalism and finding the true path to good life in God and service to Spain’s eternal institutions. While Accion Popular must continue its progress of adjusting to the new and developing Spain, we have proven that Spain, eternal Espana, still has quite a bit of fight left in her, and while the days of the Empire have long passed, through Accion Popular’s actions, perhaps she can rise to new heights once more.

However, now that we have returned to the political scene, radicalized by the slow progress of reforms, overt political Catholicism of the military regime and the presence of our old monarchist rivals on the Spanish throne once more, PR must take a swift policy shift towards these monarchists. We cannot tolerate monarchist sympathies that would draw us closer to Accion Popular, because to associate with that party would be associating with those that ruined the Republic.\n\nInstead, those monarchists that insist on remaining in our party, such as the prominent Restoration era politician Santiago Alba, must be converted to be true Radicals. Partido Radical must not slip back to its complacent moderate position, we are a party of action first and foremost and to slowly drift towards monarchism would be the death knell to our party. The monarchists of PR will accept our new political positions or leave, probably to join the DLE or the cursed Accion Popular, yet to get rid of these wolves in sheep’s clothing will only strengthen our party.

Few parties in Spain have been so rife with corruption, grift and embezzlement as Partido Radical, and scandals such as the Straperlo affair of 1934, where the nephew of Alejandro Lerroux was caught trying to influence Accion Popular politicians to accept the legalization of fixed roulette. Accion Popular used this affair as a way to blackmail Radicals and republicans in general, and the fallout left Partido Radical reeling for quite some time. While it did enact a small purge within the party, the rate of corruption within PR is incredibly difficult to fully root out, and many of our senior politicians, such as Rafael Salazar Alonso and Moreno Calvo, have been implicated in many corruption and bribery cases.\n\nThe party leader Alejandro Lerroux has managed to remain free of these scandals thus far, but his shady dealings in ruling his personal fiefdom, the street of Paraleo in Barcelona, a notable hive of scum and villainy, have made him very suspicious to law enforcement agents, at least those not in his pocket at the moment. However, while sweeping the party clean of corrupt grifters would probably make it better at doing, well, its job as governors of the Spanish people, one could also argue that the election victory implicates that no change is needed. After all, Spanish people have lived under the corrupt military regime for almost two decades now, and while Lerroux’s party has many that enjoy the finer things in life, assisted by generous ‘political interest groups’, they can’t be as ridiculously corrupt as the military, after all?\n\nHowever, many within Lerroux’s inner circle have argued that we must instead turn the accusations to our strength, purge the party of worst offenders and return to the golden days of the pre-Primo de Rivera era, when Lerroux was known as a firebrand populist, willing to use methods other parties didn’t have the guts to, bringing radical change to Spain even if it meant taking or giving a few bribes here and there to achieve."

This has obviously greatly weakened our party in the short term, but in the long term the damage done to PR’s reputation may finally be repaired and our pride restored. However, now that we have stripped the party from many of its most prominent members, the question remains, where do we go from here? Obvious answer would be a return to radical liberalism, allowing us to perhaps integrate Diego Martinez-Barrio’s Union Espanola in the future, but many also view this as too similar to them in case they want to retain the parties as separate entities, and thus it would likely lead us to bleeding voters to UE in the future as well. Others have instead argued that we should adopt the ideology of our smaller regional party,  the Valencian Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista. PURA was, at its infancy, dominated by one man, Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, whose ideology was in broad strokes similar to that of Partido Radical, but in reality much more in touch with the local population, and some would argue, more linked to regionalism. However, this is not the case, as while the party maintains a very Valencian nature, they still promote Spanish nationalism same as PR, and fight back against Catalan separatism. The party is noted for its heavy use of grassroots populism, and at times, direct political action even in the form of violence to achieve its goals. This could give us a truly reinvigorating perspective into governance. But these are not the only options. Others yet have argued that we should retain some elements of our former moderate outlook during the  Republican years, and instead lean more towards Classical liberal ideals, to appease the growing middle-class support of PR over our working-class supporters in Barcelona.

This would greatly help with colonial affairs and future colonial projects should we hope to advance further into Central Africa in the inevitable case of German colonial collapse. However, although the project is paid for, there is a matter of Antonio Nombela, who our informants claim is planning to snitch out on this project. Given that we had to grease quite a few wheels to get the West Africa Company to sign the papers, this is obviously unacceptable.\n\nAs Partido Radical is looking to tap into the potential of African colonial trade, especially given the very destabilized nature of Mittelafrika’s law enforcement, we must get the trade route up and running, and having some upstart colonial enforcer stepping out of his role to snoop in the business is too risky. We could obviously just dismiss him, but other party members consider this too likely to get spotted by authorities, so there has been suggestions to fabricate an accident for the man or to implicate him for some crime that would get him locked off for some time, giving us time to pull this colonial venture through."

While in parts, this could be considered true, these insults were mostly coming from Catalan anarchists and separatists who were seeking to leave the glorious nation of Spain to form their own breakaway state, so one could claim they were not in a position to hurl such claims.\n\nHowever, while the term Lerrouxismo is infamous, the promises of such ideology tend to appeal to many young and radical men, especially those who live in the regions dominated by one of Spain’s many minority groups, for example the cities of Bilbao and Barcelona. These men, brought to these cities due to their growing industrial might, found themselves surrounded by foreign language, foreign culture and hostile attitudes towards Spaniards, all because these virtuous men wanted to continue working for the betterment of Spain. Lerroux provided a voice for them, denouncing the Catholic church feeding lies to them and the separatist scum looking down upon them for being loyal to the true ruler of Iberia, the Spanish state. Lerroux’s closeness to the people, easily achievable due to his control over the famous entertainment street, Paraleo of Barcelona, allowed him to use his populist rhetoric and radical ideas to reach the Spanish patriots and use them to break those who would seek to break Spain apart or to the ignorance of old, be they anarchists, socialists, separatists or church lackeys. \n\nHis violent anti-clericalism and anti-syndicalism inspired many to fight the good fight against forces hostile to Spanish nature. But throughout the years, Lerroux lost some of his fire. The republic’s initial reforms went against his beliefs, pushing him to ally right-wing parties and compromise with the Catholics. Fighting the radicalism of his fellow republicans, PRR adopted moderatism, but given that the Republican experiment was cut short by the military jackals, perhaps it’s time to light the fire of Lerrouxismo again. As we did back in 1910s, we shall act now, serving as a vanguard of modernity, its noble barbarians bringing the fight to church backwardness, socialist lies, separatist delusion and anarchist degeneracy alike.

While the dictator may have been a tyrant, at least his response to the Catalan devils was appropriate. Now, Catalan separatists once more conspire with the anarchists of CNT-FAI, and Spanish unity is at risk.\n\nRunning battles between the police and emboldened Catalan separatists from Estat Catala, Nosaltras Sols and Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana-Estat Català are almost daily occurrences, and Guardia Civil is working overtime in pursuing leads about suspected separatist holdouts. More muscle is needed to bring this insidious movement down, and the history of Partido Radical may have the answer ready. Back in the end of 1910s, Lerrouxist republicans participated in an organization called Liga Patriótica Española, an ad hoc organization consisting of Carlist workers, police and military men, Mellistas and even football hooligans from the club Real Club Deportivo Espanyol de Barcelona. These mixed units faced down Catalan nationalists on the streets, battering sense into their stubborn heads.

While these concessions will not be the regionalist-loving softness of Izquierda Espanola or the moderate regionalism of Union Espanola, they will nonetheless be a massive policy shift for Partido Radical, and one we must recover from in other areas to avoid total party collapse."

A true source of power for Lerroux has almost always been his knowledge of connecting with the working man, which has allowed him to exploit the fears and dreams of the common man to achieve enough political capital for his political goals. His connection to the average Spaniards was partially due to his control over the street of Paralelo, one of the main streets of Barcelona known for its theatres, cabarets and circuses.\n\nThe significance of Paralelo is immense, as the street rivals many of the famous entertainment centres of the world, such as London’s West End, New York’s Broadway and Paris’ Montmartre, housing such renowned venues such as El Molino concert hall, Teatro-Circo Olympia circus and Talía Theatre. The street may be a source of great art, but it is also rife with drug use, prostitution and organized crime, leading it to have a very two-faced appearance. This duality, however, has allowed Lerroux to connect with elites and workers alike, as his grip on the street has been absolute until the Catalans drove him out temporarily, but he returned in force and his political machine became synonymous with the night-life of Paralelo, granting him the nickname ‘Emperor of Paralelo’.\n\nNow, the Emperor of Paralelo labours under the Spanish king, but he has not forgotten his roots in the dirt of that Catalan street, and as Lerroux continues his crackdown on Catalan separatism, Paralelo serves as his castle to rule the realm of Barcelona from, the Emperor’s agents hunting down separatists and anarchists alike."

In the speech, he addressed many young radicals, committed anti-clericals and fierce streetfighters, saying:\n\n‘Young barbarians of today: enter and sack the decadent civilization of this unhappy country, destroy its temples, finish off its gods, tear the veil from its novices and raise them up to be mothers to virilize the species, break into the records of property and make bonfires of its papers that fire may purify the infamous social organization. Enter its humble hearths and raise the legions of proletarians that the world may tremble before their awakened judges. Do not be stopped by altars nor by tombs. Fight, kill, die’\n\nThe announcement was followed by hysterical action in the crowd, as they were caught in the fervour of the speech, but for the rest of Spain’s political scene, the announcement was met with mixed reactions. Accion Popular, Partido Nacional Espanola and Derecha Liberal Republicana denounced such violent demagoguery and claimed that Lerroux would only push Spain back to the chaos of the last decade once more.

However, the party’s small but influential monarchist wing, still around despite the crackdown earlier in PR’s history, has argued that brokering a power-sharing deal with the king could be beneficial for Lerrouxists as it would end the needless stalemate that continues to harm PR’s image and prevents alliances with moderate monarchists such as the members of DLE. However, thus far Lerroux has brushed such ideas aside, claiming that as long as he draws breath, Radical party shall remember the crimes the monarchists committed on the republic.

Its many issues remain, yet despite all the shady dealings and connections with the underworld of Spain, the immensely firebrand rhetoric of Lerroux and his increasing levels of populism, Partido Radical has returned to Spanish politics in force, much to the dismay of monarchists, syndicalists, separatists and clergy alike.

The Emperor of Paralelo now carries a new moniker, the Radical Caudillo, and in his wake a new Spain rises, one with almost as many contradictions and complicated webs of connections as the man leading it."

sprd.205.d:0 "The Spanish railways of today are in a sorry state. The anarchist and socialist insurgencies have been a nuisance to rail travel, with saboteurs blowing up rail and railway points, locomotive storehouses and other highly expensive materials. But even beyond these troublemakers, the sad state has been largely thanks to the unwillingness of private owners to upgrade and maintain their rail lines, and the relatively primitive degree at which Spain has been able to create its rail lines in general. The calls for nationalization of the railways, already started by Francesc Cambo during his tenure as a minister during the Restoration era, have begun to grown louder, as examples such as the Compañía de los Ferrocarriles Andaluces show just how incapable these private companies are at running such a vital service.\n\nThe company Explotación de Ferrocarriles por el Estado has already laid plans for the management of a state-owned railway company, though before its scope was limited to merely those companies already incorporated under state ownership, not to all of Spain. However, with the rising popular will to see railway travel become owned by the state, even the most hardline free market capitalists within the Cortes are now not as opposed to the concept as a decade ago, and as the government has promised to compensate the affected private enterprises fairly, the project seems to barrel onwards at full speed.\n\nThe new state company is planned to be named Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles or RENFE, and it would see the integration of both larger companies such as Compañía de los Caminos de Hierro del Norte de España, Compañía del Ferrocarril de Madrid a Zaragoza y Alicante and Compañía Nacional de los Ferrocarriles del Oeste, as well as smaller regional actors such as Ferrocarriles Vascongados. The new rail line is planned to mostly utilize Hanomag, Krauss and Engerth locomotives, with some electric railcars provided by the Swiss Brown Boveri company, with various gaps in supply filled in by older French and English locomotives, though the revolution in these countries makes spare parts an issue of operation. It is hoped that RENFE might eventually have the ability to start manufacturing of local designs or licensed copies of locomotives, to make the supply chain far easier to maintain, though thanks to the enormous sums needed to make the nationalization happen, this will likely happen far into the future."

sprd.206.d:0 "The Rio Tinto mines in Andalusia have been a source of minerals and metals for Spain since the antiquity as the Iberian Pyrite Belt has provided wealth and materials for the Romans, Phoenicians and many other empires for nearly 3000 years. While Spain utilized these mines through local companies during the 1700s and 1800s and sought to modernize the extraction of resources with little actual results, the situation rapidly changed as the British capitalists caught wind of the riches of Andalusia. Headed by the Rothschild family, the British company bosses won a bid to gain rights to the mines from the First Republic for the price of mere 94 000 pesetas, a pittance given the dire straits the republic’s economy was at the time. \n\nThe English would form the company Rio Tinto Company Limited, and as their economic activity took wind into its sails, the company grew to become the largest mining center in the world at the time, with the construction of a railway to the mine itself being one of the driving factors of newfound prosperity as pack animals were no longer needed to haul the contents of the mine. This immense wealth from the copper, gold and silver mines of Rio Tinto would see the region transform into a miniature British colony, with their own luxury district of Bellavista Neighborhood, with its very own sports fields for Anglo sports, a Presbyterian church and various other excesses. However, as the British regime in their homeland collapsed, many refugees would flee to Spain, only to leave during the proclamation of the republic, afraid of the new left-wing regime. The mines were still own by the Brits and the unstable regime leading Spain until 1936 was too powerless to do much about this status quo, though British interest in the mines themselves was waning in favour of exploiting the resources of their colonies.\n\nWith this in mind, the new government has maneuvered to gain control of the mines for itself, and as the long-time rival of RTC, Peña del Hierro mine, was recently nationalized due to abysmal yearly earnings, the eyes of Madrid now turn to RTC. The memory of British capital vanishing from Spanish markets after the British revolution and Great Depression on the Canadian mainland now resurfaced in the minds of Spain’s governors, and the government has started negotiations on how to approach this issue with the mines ownership. Many claim that the mines belong to Spain by right, as a compensation for the British withdrawal from rest of Spain, but the more business-savvy members of the government and Cortes see this as a diplomatic suicide towards the Canadians and propose a purchase of the mines for a similar sum to that with which it was originally bought by the British. With the British interest in Iberia at its lowest point, this may be possible to achieve, without upsetting the Canadians too much, though it is obviously going to cost us more than a simple forced nationalization would."

sprd.207.d:0 "The automotive industry of Europe was heavily shaken by the Communard revolution in France and later by the fracturing of Italy and the syndicalist takeover of Britain. Brand names such as Peugeot and Renault as well as the British Rolls-Royce disappeared from prominence, their factories turned into worker ownership or shipped off to the colonies, only to appear as a rump company. The upheavals in the Americas made it difficult for the United States to capitalize on this, and the prominence of German and Austrian firms in the European market was primarily only challenged by Ford.\n\nSpain would serve as a frontline for this rivalry, with Ford’s local factories belonging to Motor Ibérica, a local branch of the company, which up until recently was the second largest subsidiary of Ford in Europe. The situation in the New World is rapidly changing, however, and Ford’s industrial empire is unraveling almost as quickly as that of the American state itself. Motor Ibérica is left bereft of support, with the American businessmen and experts within the company either returning to their homeland to fight in the terrible wars there or staying here in Spain until the situation stabilizes, but the company itself is nearly collapsing without the financial connections to the main company.\n\nThere are hardly more auspicious odds for the Spanish government to nationalize the company than now, with it floundering like a fish out of water and looking for a way out. We can either march in and dismantle the local American ownership once and for all, or simply pay them off and seize the company that way, to create the Motor Ibérica, S.A. company fully under national ownership. This would provide us with a strong industrial base for civilian and military vehicle manufacturing, and as a consequence, we no longer need to purchase everything from local private contractors as Hispano-Suiza. The contacts the company has to Morocco, Nationalist France, Italy and Portugal will likely help push the new sales out, even if the ownership is different from the original Ford company."

As the drums of war are growing louder over Europe and the Americas are engulfed in a terrible period of civil strife, the weapons manufacturers of Spain have had their fill to eat, but it is clear that while Spain has its fair share of infantry arms, there is much to be desired when it comes to heavy weapons. The Spanish artillery corps has been wishing for a domestic design for quite some time, and it seems that finally a new program is on the way. The La Naval metallurgy company, known for its smelters and factories in the Cantabrian town of Reinosa, has announced the creation of a new artillery piece based on the leFH 18 German field howitzer.\n\nWhile not the earth shattering bombardier that the Germans are known to also field, the leFH is far more mobile, faster-firing and far, far easier to build than the Krupp’s monsters.  The new artillery piece, named initially as Obús 105/26 Reinosa after the town itself, has already progressed to initial stages of testing, and the company has began to market it to the South American allies and friends of our regime, with Dominican Republic showing a degree in interest at buying a few pieces. Should the program succeed, it would greatly help Spain start its own heavy weapons industry, and while the nation will likely stay in the shadow of the German industrial giants for a long time, Reinosa’s products may find eager buyers among those on the Kaiserreich’s black list."

sprd.209.d:0 "The Spanish state has long been struggling to keep up with other European powers, and the agricultural nature of the nation’s economy has served as its greatest strength and most notable weakness. The latifundios, vineyards and citrus forests of Spain have long provided the nation and its trade partners with many exquisite tastes and much needed foodstuffs, but it has also meant that while nations such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany reaped the benefits of the modern industrial revolution, Spain lagged behind and was left out. Only the regions of Barcelona and Biscay saw a degree of industrial development, but given the strong regional identity of these two areas, it has been a highly difficult situation for the rest of Spain.\n\nAs such, the new government has opened a program to supply much needed talent and experience into the pool of Spanish academics, providing the tools for a truly industrial revolution in the great nation so that it no longer suffers the fate of backwardness. Practical education, such as the school of Escuela de Ingenieros Industriales de Barcelona, shall be expanded to the programs all over the nations, from Madrid to the ancient universities of Valencia, Salamanca and Sevilla, to relatively new universities such as the University of Murcia and University of La Laguna.\n\nAdditionally, companies specializing in industrial development will get their fair share of new funding, especially in areas where there is relatively little actual development going on currently, such as MZOV construction company in Galicia, La Montañesa Textil in Cantabria and the Sociedad Minera y Metalúrgica de Peñarroya in Murcia, Barcelona and Andalusia. There are hopes that the government could also fund the merger of the Asturian steel and coal mines and factories to create a new, mostly-nationally owned producer of coal to fund the new programs by supplying coal-hungry regimes such as the French National State centrally. However, only future will tell whether this endeavor succeeds, but it is safe to say that the educational and industrial development of Spain has started its very first trek towards full modernity."

sprd.210.t:0 "Dorothy"
sprd.210.d:0 "A curious offer has recently arrived to the desk of the head of Spanish air force, Alfredo Kindelán. A famed British aviator and playboy Jim Mollison had arrived to Madrid earlier today on his Bellanca 28-70 aircraft, with the intention to sell it to the Spanish authorities. The aircraft, nicknamed Dorothy, was initially used by Mollison in his attempt to break a speed record between the Algiers-Cape Town air route, but as this plan failed and Mollison was ordered to India in preparation of possible hostilities between the Indian splinter states, Mollison sought to sell Dorothy off for some local military to be used as a reconnaissance aircraft. The French Nationalist air force had not shown interest towards the plane, and the Moroccans were supplied by German factories, so Mollison decided to approach the Spanish air force instead. The aircraft is a tempting offer, as it possesses very high speeds at 442 km/h maximum speed, is considered a relatively easy plane to fly and according to our engineers, could be fitted with armament without too many issues related to performance. \n\nThe Bellanca company in the United States is in dire straits due to the civil strife on-going there, but they have nonetheless always been reputed as an innovative and limit-pushing company with their designs. With a service ceiling of 9300 metres and a range exceeding 4000 kilometres, the aircraft is far more capable than its current Spanish counterparts, such as the Hispano-Suiza HS.34 trainer. Adopting the plane could be the first step towards creating a truly modern Spanish reconnaissance wing, though some have pointed out that sourcing spare parts might be an issue should Bellanca be entangled in the American crisis. Nonetheless, famed Spanish aviators such as Juan de Ansaldo have tested the aircraft and support the purchase, though ultimately it is a decision of Kindelán whether the plane is accepted or not."

sprd.211.d:0 "Despite the fact that Spain managed to avoid the terrors of the Weltkrieg, Spanish aviation history is not one of idleness and backwardness, as the fledgling Aviación Militar has already seen its fair share of combat flights in the Rif War and during the numerous revolts of 1930s. One of the rising stars of this new branch of the military is the adventurer, far-right militia leader and nobleman pilot, Juan Antonio Ansaldo y Vejarano. Hailing from Basque Country, the famous pilot first saw combat during the Rif War, proving to be a scourge on the tiny air force of Abd el Krim after the destroyed one of the Durell aircrafts in their inventory and would later score other destructions of enemy aircrafts after Rifians had captured some downed Spanish planes. Ansaldo also participated in the daring Alhucemas landing, and during one sortie, kept out a stubborn attack against Rifian positions despite being wounded, turning back towards home base only after running out of ammunition and other munitions.\n\nHis action would earn Ansaldo much praise and adoration, and when the last guns of Rif fell silent, king Alfonso XIII would personally grant him the Laureate Cross of San Fernando for his actions in the campaign. In his personal life, Ansaldo supported his wife Pilar in attaining a pilot license as well, and after the declaration of the republic, he would leave the military out of ideological reasons, being a hardline monarchist. His support for right-wing parties grew over time, and Ansaldo collaborated with the Hispanist magazine Acción Española. Known for his adventurous, brash and at times, violent presence, he became one of the key militia leaders working to undermine the republic and supported General Sanjurjo, a close friend of his, in the toppling of the republic. After the restoration of monarchy in Spain, Ansaldo has returned to be an important pilot in the air force, leading a squadron of bombers. His political activities remain numerous still, but have been slightly slowed by Ansaldo’s increased role in military activity."

sprd.212.d:0 "The Spanish air force may not be the most advanced or experienced in the world, but despite its lacking state, Spain has seen many a famous aviator within the ranks of its air force. Among the most famous pilots is Ramón Franco, who earned most of his fame in 1925 as a crewmember for the flying boat Plus Ultra, a model J Dornier Wal, piloted by him and another famous aviator, Julio Ruiz de Alda. Together with two other crew members, thry crossed the Atlantic from Spain to Argentina for the first time on a journey crossing over ten thousand kilometres and required over 60 hours of flight. Hailed as a hero for this achievement, Franco would return to Spain with Ruiz de Alda and serve as a flight officer until 1930, when his political leanings first reared their head. Franco, as his brothers Nicolas and Francisco before him, had joined the army in 1910s, eschewing the life of a priest for the military, but unlike his brothers, Ramón would soon turn to radical republicanism.\n\nThis turn was partly caused by Franco’s second attempted crossing of the Atlantic, where his plane broke down and led to the cancellation of further attempts, much to the ire of Ramón himself. He became a strong opponent against the monarchy and dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, and together with another revolutionary airman Ignacio Hidalgo de Cisneros, the pilots attempted to bomb the royal palace in Madrid. However, their courage faltered and in the end the bombing was switched to the dropping of republican leaflets. This led to Franco’s dismissal and he turned further into radicalism, starting a Masonic Lodge while in exile and later, after the proclamation of the Republic, he was a prominent member of the Jabalí group, made up of anti-government radicals, federalists and moderate syndicalists. While Franco is not a friend of the Spanish crown in the slightest, he is nonetheless one of the greatest aviators of his generation, and his importance in the republican circles cannot be understated."

sprd.213.d:0 "The Spanish history of flight has been dominated by men, as can be expected, but recently, women have slowly started nudging their way into the field as well. The very first woman aviator of Spain has unfortunately mostly retired from the public sphere, but her legacy continues in the many other brave women chasing ever greater heights over Iberia today. That woman is María Bernaldo de  Quirós, Marquess of Alvaros. She first came into contact with aviation after witnessing a forced landing of an aircraft very close, and during the same year in 1928 she would officially get her pilot’s license from Real Aeroclub de Madrid, the first woman in Spain to do so. \n\nHer preferred craft was the D.H 60 Moth, brought into Spain by the exiles right around the time of the British collapse, and to encourage Bernaldo’s career, the De Havilland company’s local representative offered her a plane of the same model at half the price, given the dire straits the company was while transferring production to the former British dominions. Bernaldo would then name the new aircraft ‘Mosquito’, which complimented her nickname Miss Swallow among the Spanish pilots. However, despite calls from over hundred pilots in Spain, she was not made into a honorary military pilot because of her gender, as the man responsible for such honourifics, general Kindelán, was a noted conservative. Bernaldo would go on to be a highly public aviation pioneer, flying in shows and races all over Spain and performing feats, especially short-distance landings, previously thought impossible. Her most famous performance was flying over Infante Jaime’s car as the prince was arriving to his destination in A Coruña, and the car received a shower of flowers tossed from the Mosquito.\n\nBernaldo would become a pioneer in a whole other field of Spanish society as she was one of the first women in Spain to attain a divorce from her husband, José Manuel Sánchez-Arjona, after taking advantage of the new legislature signed by the republic to allow such matters. Recent news indicate that Bernaldo has since then started a relationship with her former flight instructor, José Rodríguez y Díaz, though she has mainly stayed out of public life since the divorce. Her example has gone on to inspire many other women, such as the famed Catalan flight instructor Mari Pepa Colomer. It would appear that one of Bernaldo’s many press statements is slowly becoming true, as the pilot herself put it: ‘As public opinion evolves, people will realize that women can do more than just embroider’."

sprd.214.d:0 "The prospect of an aircraft capable of taking off and landing near vertically, without the need for long runways or even short strips of land, has long intrigued the minds of aviators. Attempts to come up with such concepts have existed since the dawn of aviation, though perhaps the most famous example is the patent for such an aircraft created by the marvellous scientific mind of Nikola Tesla. Tesla created a concept of a vertical takeoff and landing machine quite recently, in 1928, but the financial crisis in the Americas and various other factors kept the project from reaching a prototype or even a wind-tunnel mockup stage. However, it would seem that Spain’s own renaissance man, Fernando Gallego Herrera, has recently dedicated himself to the task of seeing Tesla’s vision come true. Starting in 1933, Gallego has worked on a craft he calls aerogenio, which utilizes compressed air-powered system which could give it an ability to take off and land vertically.\n\nBased on Gallego’s statements, such a craft could fly from Salamanca to Madrid in ten minutes, and cross the Atlantic from Madrid to New York in four to six hours. He also planned for it to have military applications, especially as a bomber. However, it would appear that the craft was cursed from the start, being denied to be shown on its first outing by the Ministry of Aviation out of fear that it would crash into the curious crowds, and following the actual first flight of the machine, the tests had to be cancelled due to issues with the rudder. This initial test also raised quite a bit of concern over whether the aerogenio could actually reach the speeds promised, but further testing was not possible after the prototype was destroyed in a fire in 1935. The device was a true marvel of engineering, even if it could not achieve all the feats promoted by Gallego, as it is completely unique in the field of aeronautics from known aircraft, or helicopters, so original that it lacks wings, propeller, rudders and tail.\n\nAccording to Gallego, he could scale the power of a mere 80 horsepower engine to lift the rather large machine, and should he be granted more funding, he could look into modifying the design further, to facilitate further tests and fine-tuning to the craft. Needless to say that the civilian and military utilizations of such a marvellous vehicle are manifold, even if it is not particularly fast or cannot carry a large payload. The work of Juan de Cierva on his autogyros has already shown the usefulness of hovercraft, and Gallego’s creation could be the very next step in evolution for these incredible machines."

Twelve officers defied this order, clearly falling into treacherous republican ideas, and were discharged from military service to be imprisoned for their treason. Among them was a man named Virgilio Leret, who spent his days in prison hard at work, designing a propulsion engine previously unknown to the world of Spanish aviation. He was released from prison before this work could be completed, as the Second Spanish republic provided an amnesty for him, but when the republic was toppled by General Sanjurjo, he was once again imprisoned for his lack of support for the coup, forced to serve his sentence in the Rif. While there, Leret finished the concept he had for a jet engine, calling it continuous reaction turbocompressor.\n\nAround the same time, similar concepts were being circulated in the Kaiserreich and Union of Britain alike, so Leret’s contribution was on the bleeding edge of scientific advancement in aviation. After the thaw in the regime following the instability of 1936 and 1937, Leret was released as he was not officially part of any radical organization, and soon he found work in Cuatro Vientos aerodrome as a mechanical engineer and lecturer on avionics. His revolutionary concept of an engine has yet to see actual implementation and construction, but should Leret be given the needed funding, his design may finally see the light of day, and propel Spanish aviation to newfound heights."

However, unlike her father’s, Colomer’s heart yearned for the skies, and she would join the Barcelona Aviation School in 1930 thanks to the help of her father, something her mother would not be aware of. In 1931, at an age of merely 17, she would finally obtain her license, and given that she was the first woman to make such an achievement, she was featured on the front cover of Catalonia’s largest newspaper, La Vanguardia, which finally made her mother aware of her extracurricular activities.\n\nShe would become something of a darling for the new republican regime, flying a banner with republican colours on the eve of the new governmental system’s proclamation, carrying the Catalan republican nationalist Lluis Companys as one of her first passengers, and both her and her teacher Josep Maria Carreras y Dexeus would appear in numerous pro-republican spectacles of the time. Perhaps the most glorious event for Colomer was her landing one of the few Zeppelins in Spain in front of a large crowd, earning her a place in the hearts of Catalans for years to come.\n\nHaving solidified her skills and place as a pioneer of Catalan aviation, she would go on to found the first cooperative of Aerial Work of Catalonia. In addition to this, she would go on to help found the Catalan School of Aviation, where she would teach much older students than herself as well. While known for spectacular showmanship and humorous stunts, such as dressing up as Mary Poppins while flying a plane, the restoration of the monarchy was not good for her career as she was known for her republican and Catalanist leanings, and the her aviation school has been the site of many inspections out of fear that it is used to train Catalan dissidents. Nonetheless, the Mary Poppins of Catalonia flies on, defying the expectations placed on Spanish and Catalan women and inspiring generations to come with her daring aerial performances."

sprd.217.d:0 "The advent of heavier-than-air flight in Spain was received relatively quickly, with numerous pioneers attempting to imitate the work of the Wright brothers in Castile, Catalonia, Andalusia and Basque country, but the roots of Spanish aviation were not dug into the ground then. In fact, pioneers of Spanish aviation go back centuries, if not millenia even, and perhaps the most known early aviator who actually finished his creation and flew it was Diego Marín Aguilera, who lived in the second half of the 18th century. Hailing from Galicia, he came from an agrarian family and took over the family farmstead after his father died, where he would use his intellect to manufacture all sorts of contraptions aimed at increasing output or helping daily life of the local peasants and farmers.\n\nHowever, his inspiration towards aviation came as he observed eagles and hawks while tending to his sheep herd, and for six years, he would toil on a flying machine, built from wood, iron, cloth, and feathers, the feathers coming from those dropped by the very same eagles and vultures he had been inspired by. His contraption, built with the help of local blacksmith Joaquín Barbero, was made to imitate the biology of the birds, especially their wings, which he tried to create using iron joints. The machine also had hand cranks and stirrups for controlling its direction, and Marín spent a long time calculating the different aspects of the bird’s biology transferred to its new iron and wooden form to ensure the possibility of flight. First taking flight from castle of Coruña del Conde during nighttime, he remarked ‘I'm going to Burgo de Osma, and from there to Soria, and I'll be back in a couple of days’. This would prove to be a false expectation, as the glider did fly for nearly 400 metres before crashing into the ground as one of the welded joints broke. Marín himself survived with merely scratches and bruises, but his ire towards Barbero was far greater, and the glider was left where it crashed for the night. \n\nHowever, the local townsfolk, seeing Marín ‘s eccentricity in a far more superstitious light, saw the contraption as a vessel of lunacy and the demonic, and they burned the flying machine, much to the humiliation of Marín. The inventor would never recover from this loss, and died at the age of 44, leaving behind no schematics or documentation on his groundbreaking invention. While there had been others before him that had attempted flight, it would appear that this misunderstood man was the father of Spanish aviation, made even more incredibly due to his lack of formal education. For this illustrious feat, the military aviation officers have suggested that the government build a monument to his ingenious machine, right in the middle of his village, proving that history does not forget pioneers, no matter how much the ignorant of their time may try to force it."

However, it is clear that the German proxy state of Morocco has been funding these rebels for years now, both in Rif and in the colonial holdings of Nationalist France. Even during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship there were plans to destabilize Morocco and invade it, though the threat of a German reprisal kept even the fiercest warmongers in check. However, with German economy shattered, its mega-colony of Mittelafrika bursting at seams and the ever-present threat of French and Russian revanchist attacks, Germany cannot support its Maghreb puppet as efficiently as it once could. As we have grown stronger, the lackeys of Muhammad V have not, and with every passing day it becomes more clear that if we were to invade, the illegitimate kingdom of Morocco would collapse in a matter of days. While this could draw the ire of the Germans, it would finally end the Rifian insurgency and restore some of the pride Spain has had such shortage of in the past since 1898."

The situation of Spain’s countryside is dire, as farm workers hardly ever get a fair compensation from their labour, workforces are rotated countrywide to ensure that they cannot organize and demand better wages as cheaper labour can always be imported from elsewhere, and during difficult seasons for the farming market, thousands starve and have to resort to quite literally eating grass and roots to survive, especially in areas like Extremadura.\n\n The matter is not helped by the tools available to workers, as they are usually no better than those used by Spanish peasants in the Middle Ages, and neither tractors, harvesters nor trucks are a common sight in the Spanish rural regions to this day. The crisis most likely started due to the increase in wheat production during the Weltkrieg, as the hungry nations of Europe demanded every bit of excess grain Spain could produce. The arrival of Ukrainian grain following the end of the war sent demand for Spanish grain spiraling, and the new peasants were left astray. The most pressing issue right now is land ownership, as large landowners dominate the nation, usually hailing from aristocratic families. However, as the republic found out, simply taking land from large landowners and distributing it to the landless people of Spain, numbering nearly a million, was an impossible task.\n\n Other ideas, such as increased utilization of communal land, creation of public gardens, expansion of agrarian land into pastoral fields and mechanization of agriculture were proposed and experimented with, but the Sanjurjada coup ended these plans and the reform has been in a limbo since, somewhat pushed by Accion Popular but mainly through expropriation of land from convicted enemies of state and transferring of said land to Catholic peasants, the expansion of rural credit collectives and farmers co-operatives, and a degree of Catholic agrarian unionism. The issue remains in full force in many areas, and it only further fuels dissent within Spain’s populace, who turn to CNT-FAI or PSOE’s agrarian sister union, FNTT, for help."

sprd.224.t:0 "Pestilence of Spain"
sprd.224.d:0 "The caciquismo, a special class of Spanish aristocrats, businessmen and administrators, were first formalized as a system during the turno pacifico era of the Restoration. The caciquists were local bosses, who ensured that the local party political machine, whether liberal or conservative, would ensure safe transfer of power without surprise victories from non-institutionalized parties. The caciquists were essentially state enforced corruption, created unofficially but known as a public secret, one that kept the establishment parties in power and ensured stability until the terrible years of early 1920s.\n\nWhen Primo de Rivera couped the government and established military rule over Spain, his regime announced an attack on caciquismo to bring about ‘authentic politics’ instead of the performative electoral veneer of democracy that had prevailed in Spain beforehand. The caciques were suppressed to a degree, but as Primo de Rivera set his sights on uprooting anarchism and socialism from Spain following the Red Scare of Spain, the actual measures taken against caciques remained small. The republicans, far more interested in fully destroying the old political system, tried to decimate the old clientelist systems of Spain’s countryside, but it only drove these bosses to side with Sanjurjo and his allies in Accion Popular against the republic.After the restructuring of Spain following the Sanjurjada, the caciques and new government remained in a relatively unhostile limbo, many caciques became members of the ruling party and its allies, such as Partido Agrario.\n\nHowever, thw more populist and radically social Catholic members of AP saw the caciques as a rotten institution brought upon by the worst excesses of the liberal Cánovas regime, and while the government of Gil-Robles had been too occupied with other major issues of Spain’s future, the time has come to strike the very heart of corruption with Spain’s countryside. Guardia Civil and Carabineros units are sent all across the nation to sniff out corrupt bosses, and while some will inevitably avoid repercussions because of political connections, this new purge should remove much of the middlemen of the system, robbing it off its efficiency for good and sending a message to potential future kleptocrats."

sprd.225.t:0 "The Jornalero Class"
sprd.225.d:0 "Jornaleros are the pillar upon which Spain’s countryside is built on, but they are also the weakest link of it, being a class of citizens so vulnerable that they bear the heaviest burden in times of crisis. Jornaleros are usually travelling seasonal workers, who go to areas of Spain during harvest season to help local farmers and landowners, especially during the harvest of wheat and olives. These workers are usually given a rather meagre wage, and in many cases, work 16 hours a day under the so called sunrise to sunset system. Attempts by these workers to unionize have happened multiple times since the year 1903, but both landowners and the government of Spain have crushed any attempts to do so. Jornaleros do not own land, nor do they rent it unlike tenant farmers, they are entirely reliant on the work available, and during recession or bad crop years, thousands would be unemployed for long periods of time, leading to an increase of crime, social unrest and poverty.\n\nEven in good harvest years, the jornaleros would remain unemployed for long periods of time. The pay for jornaleros was never good enough to get them through these months of unemployment, and the weak social safety nets of Spain did not protect these workers at all, leading to many scavenging food from the forests or stealing their fill from the fields of local landlords. The price of their labour was kept low by importing workers from other regions if local jornaleros started demanding better wages. During the republican years, Largo Caballero, the minister of labour tried to implement a law that would ban this practice by setting municipal boundaries for workers, making it illegal to travel in search of work and forcing landlords to pay better for the work locally. These disputes between the distribution of profits and wages were to be negotiated between committees formed of land owners and toilers, though Caballero’s law never came to fully pass following the Sanjurjada coup and subsequent overturning of republican initiatives.\n\nHowever, the new government has grown increasingly supportive of such a measure for jornaleros, and in addition, new programs have been started to find work for these part-time labourers that would allow them to better survive the long months without harvest work. Infrastructure and construction projects, such as the improvement of roads in remote regions such as Extremadura and Galicia, are planned, run through companies such as MZOV and Entrecanales y Távora. It is hoped that this will not only help the unemployed, but will also lead to increased output for the regions as the better infrastructure helps transport of goods to be faster and more efficient. However, fixing the situation of jornaleros is not enough, nor a long term solution, but will help these poor folk in the aftermath of the Black Monday"
sprd.225.a:0 "Not a full solution, but a step towards it."

sprd.226.t:0 "Republican Initiatives"
sprd.226.d:0 "The republican attempt at land reform was far from an easy one, and its central issues were that the socialist-republican coalition tried to push for too large-scale of a reform with too little actual results. The agrarian reform focused heavily on land seizures, especially from large latifundios and church land, polarizing public opinion and making enemies of the large landowners, while the actual land gained for new toilers was a relatively meagre in total hectares, settling only a few thousand families compared to the near million landless in Spain.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the agrarian reform ideas of the republicans were all bad or unusable, and the current government seeks to implement some that were reversed in the aftermath of the coup. For example, the removal of the sol e sol system, where workers would quite literally work from sunrise to sunset, is a major part of the reforms, and an eight-hour work day will be instituted to counter such brutal working hours on the jornaleros and other agrarian workers. Similarly, new protections will be instituted on renters to ensure that their leases are not cancelled suddenly, and finally, arbitration committees staffed by employers and employees equally will ensure that the new laws are followed, and should there be issues caused by either side, fines will be issued on the conflicting party.\n\nThe Instituto de Reforma Agraria, resurrected after years of negligence, will receive more funding to ensure that the land expropriations that must be taken, will be done in a matter that fits the region and respects the private property of Spain’s landowners. Largest landowners will of course suffer financially from the issue, but if moderate enough action is taken and the compensation is made lucrative enough, the government believes that the agrarian crisis can be solved slowly but surely."

sprd.227.t:0 "Local Means for Local Needs"
sprd.227.d:0 "Few nations in Europe are as immensely varied in conditions as Spain, with much of the nation having immense elevation differences, climate variations from the cool Atlantic climate of the Basque country to the humid Mediterranean climate of Catalonia and Andalusia and large differences in the possible crops and uses of land from region to region. The large latifundios and cattle ranches of the south contrasted with the minifundios and pastoral ways of the north. Similarly, some areas such as Extremadura have traditionally focused almost solely on pigs and sheep, and only a small degree of the land there is used for dry farming, while regions such as Catalonia are filled to the brim with vineyards, citrus farms and olive tree plantations.\n\n The differences of Spain are stark, and unless great care is placed at local cultural differences, such as the existence of the so called dead strain laws of Catalonia or the unique agricultural challenges of Extremadura, we may be looking at far greater regional political turmoil if our attempts at agrarian reforms are done badly. As such, local experts play a key role in actually developing strategies for reforms, and the Instituto de Reforma Agraria has been given generous funding to track down and enlist the help of neutral academic or career experts in regions of Spain most desperately in need of complete overhauls."

sprd.229.t:0 "End of the Century-Old Schism"
sprd.229.d:0 "The dynastic divide of Spain has always been an almost insurmountable gap between Spain’s traditionalists, but the arrival of the Republic seemed to finally bring closer unity between Carlists and Alfonsine monarchists. The negotiations between the two groups before Sanjurjada came close to hammering home an agreement between the supporters of Alfonso XIII and the wayward sons of Alfonso Carlos, with the main subject of these negotiations being that should a restoration occur, Juan de Bourbon-Battenberg would be chosen as the successor to both groups. However, Sanjurjo and his allies chose to restore Alfonso XIII, seeing him as a more pliable puppet, and the Carlists, enraged by this betrayal, began to plot an uprising that would seat their own candidate on the throne of Spain.\n\nHowever, after the restoration of Jaime I to the throne, his even more hardliner stance on traditionalism has caused many Carlists to change their views on the situation, and the separatist revolt further weakened their ranks as the more radical members of the organization joined the separatists and perished in running battles against the Spanish army and Guardia Civil.\n\nBereft of their regionalist allies and faced with the resurgent Alfonsine monarchism, the Traditionalist Communion has sent a representative, a dual-member of both Carlist groups and Renovación Española, Romualdo de Toledo, to negotiate a possible merger of the two dynastic lines back into one. Given the ideological similarities the two main supporters of monarchism, it’s not surprising that the Carlists would seek this unity, but the question remains whether Renovación Española seeks to truly integrate the Traditionalist Communion or simply have them as political partners in the future?"

sprd.230.t:0 "Taming the Wolves of Spain’s Right"
sprd.230.d:0 "The recent years have not been kind to Spain. Even before the rising of the traitorous separatist scum, militias and paramilitary gangs were a regular sight on the streets. CNT-FAI and their PSOE and BOC allies were constantly attempting to subvert our rule, and especially in 1936 anarchist deathsquads would attack conservative politicians in their homes while the traditionalists were actively training their Requete troops in the difficult terrain of Navarra and Basque Country to strike at the heart of the kingdom and install their pretender king. The right-wing militias hardly helped the spiral, as groups such as Juan Antonio Ansaldo’s Guerillas de Guerrillas de España, José Calvo Sotelo’s Juventudes Unificadas de Acción Nacionalista and the Legionarios de España of José María Albiñana were a common sight on the streets, with their harassment and persecution of opposing politicians, be they socialists, republicans or even moderate monarchists led to increased societal division.\n\nThe streets of large cities weren’t safe for the most part of 1936, and when the separatist revolts began, the weakened anarchists and republicans attempted large-scale riots and rebellions in addition to those happening in the uprising regions. While it is true that without the support of right-wing militias in suppressing the left-wing rebellions, the Spanish kingdom may have ceased to exist, their presence continues to create an atmosphere of tension and paranoia. As the anarchists have gone underground or fled to France, the separatists are crushed and the republicans driven to exile, many feel that the right-wing militias may soon start fighting amongst themselves. \n\nRumours are already spreading of Ansaldo’s Guerillas fighting with the Legionaries of PNE, as Ansaldo is, most importantly, a power-hungry adventurer. The new moderate administration cannot stand this situation, and the loyalists within the military who can be counted upon not to have aligned with any of the militias will be sent to dismantle them, peacefully if possibly, by force if need be. The Kingdom of Spain cannot tolerate such infighting within its supporters, and any differences of opinion must be discussed through political means within the new, transformed Cortes, not through barbarian street brawls. Spain cannot become a kraterocracy where the strongest militia gets to rule through fear and violence, for that led us down the path of collapse before. "

sprd.231.t:0 "The Dilemma of Regionalism"
sprd.231.d:0 "The question of regionalism is a touchy subject, as the recent conflict was heavily supported by even moderate regionalist parties and minority nationalism has been a thorn in the side of Spain’s counterrevolutionary forces for decades now. Figures like Francesc Macia, Luis Arana, Daniel Cardona i Civit and Vicente Risco have caused issues to Guardia Civil and Carabineros throughout the years, most importantly during the Plot of Prats de Mollo, where Catalan separatists tried to invade Catalonia through Commune of France. The Communards are more than happy to use these internal divisions to their advantage as they continue to undermine Hispanic unity within Iberia, and the local parties are eager to use their support.\n\nNonetheless, if Spain’s minorities are to be trampled under the iron boot of Spanish army and Guardia Civil, it’s bound to cause further dissent. Moderates within the new regime, such as the supporters of Partido Fusionista and Partido Agrario Español, have supported establishing a limited degree of autonomy to the regional groups, using only reliable parties such as Dereita Galeguista, Derecha de Cataluña, Partido Socialista Monárquico and Unión Navarra, who will act as a converging point to loyal regionalists.\n\nThese groups can then advocate development of autonomy within the interests of local groups and the national interests of Spain, to avoid further trouble with separatist groups. However, to most members of Accion Popular, this is simply unacceptable, and they are only willing to give limited linguistic rights to the citizens of Catalan and Basque regions. Given the federal nature of the party, they believe that if the Basques and Catalans want to improve their situation, they must do it through their own respective parties, such as Acción Popular Catalana, Unión Navarra, Derecha Regional Valenciana and Unión Regional de Derechas de La Coruña. Through this loyalist dialogue can certain rights be granted if local leadership considers it pertinent, though autonomy of certain regions will only lead to the further dissolution of Spanish unity, something that AP’s Jefe, Jose Maria Gil-Robles, considers utterly unacceptable."

sprd.232.t:0 "Protectionism and Autarky of New Spain"
sprd.232.d:0 "Black Monday and the collapse of the Mitteleuropa economic sphere showed clearly that the markets cannot be trusted to always remain stable, and when they do crash, it is the smaller nations of economic spheres that pay the price. As such, despite their overt Germanophilia, members of the Spanish right have now grown wary of German economic domination, and there has been a far stronger call to economic protectionism, decoupling Spain’s markets from rest of Europe to return to the agrarian domestic model that dominated its economic development prior to the Primo de Rivera dictatorship. Trade will resume with friendly nations of South America to a large degree, but German and other Mitteleuropan businesses will be nationalized if they’ve lingered here long enough to still remain.\n\nThis is mainly due to the bitter taste left by the sudden withdrawal of Germany from multiple profitable ventures in mainland Spain and Rif right after the first shockwave of the Black Week. Some corporations, such as the large filmmaker CIFESA, will likely continue cooperation with German businesses, as their connections to the Kaiserreich are too vital to cut, but for the most part, Spain will seek new business partners elsewhere while maintaining a very isolationist and protectionist outlook on its domestic market as the nation recovers from these near crippling crises. Some of this loss in trade will be supplemented by trade with the Entente, especially French National State, as well as the Latin American countries, but the reality of the situation is that Spain must strive for autarky if it wishes to avoid a crash of this magnitude again.."

sprd.233.d:0 "The period between Primo de Rivera’s removal from power and the short rule  of Dámaso Berenguer are generally known as the period of dictablanda, a dictatorship that preserves the civil liberties of Spain’s people while concentrating power to the military-led state. When the moderate conservatives were installed as the king’s new cabinet, many expected a quick return to at least some degree of pluralist democracy, even if it would not be a liberal democratic one, but the current government disagrees with this notion.\n\nThey believe that Spain’s radical right would simply use it to gain power once more and dismantle what little institutions remain within Spain, which in turn would lead to another collapse down the line. The moderate ruling coalition is of the opinion that only through the mild authoritarian rule and taking inspiration from the Berenguer dictablanda can Spain return to normalcy and begin rebuilding itself from the ground up, to fix the mistakes of the republic, the military autocracy and the Accion Popular provisional government in handling the numerous issues that plague Spain today.\n\nPerhaps one day, some degree of constitutional democracy can be reinstituted, but for now, the moderates shall rule alone and use their strong executive to weaken the power-hungry radicals of other right-wing parties, the greedy military men seeking to reinstate a Sanjurjo-style dictatorship and the remaining republicans wishing to topple the God-ordained kingdom of Spain. For now, however, the lives of Spaniards can be as free as is possible to be allowed to them, and while they may not influence the political course of our nation much, they can rest assured that their rights as citizens of Spain are guaranteed."

sprd.234.d:0 "Juventud de Accion Popular, the youth wing of the party mentioned in its name, has always been the hotspot of radicalization within AP, and after the rise of Accion Popular to be the leader of Spain’s right, this has only increased with time. These Camilas Verdes, or Greenshirts, as they are colloquially known, issued a founding manifesto upon their formation in 1932, declaring war on syndicalism and Freemasonry as they claim these movements to be inherently anti-Spanish and will lead to Spain denying that what makes Spain itself. Recently, JAP has added republicanism to this list of enemies, claiming that the accidentalist positions some within Accion Popular took upon the proclamation of the second Spanish republic were misguided and at worst, simply traitorous.\n\nTo these restless and violent youth of our party, the monarchy is the new normal, and with the old unpopular monarch Alfonso XIII gone, the youth wing has revitalized to be a banner of monarchism, striking syndicalist sympathizers, communist rabble rousers and republican lackeys on the streets where ever these vermin rear their heads. However, with much of their old enemies gone, the youth wing has turned inwards, and possibly the most notable change was the expulsion of the movement’s leader and founder, Jose Maria Valiente, who was expelled for Carlist sympathies. Alongside him, various other Carlist sympathizers were imprisoned, exiled or even killed, and JAP’s new leader, José María Pérez de Laborda has announced that weak links within the organization will be purged, be they leftovers from the Christian democratic wing or sympathizers of non-monarchist organizations, such as Juntas Castellanas de Actuation Hispanica.\n\nMany moderates now fear that JAP will become a para-military wing of the monarchy, lashing out at any perceived opponents with violence and blackmail, until none but the most staunchest monarchist remain in Spain’s political apparatus. Many have also noted the personality cult of José María Gil-Robles and the veneration the JAP has for El Hefe, which is increasingly viewed with suspicion by members of Accion Popular. It is feared that Gil-Robles would utilize JAP to remove political opponents within the party and install loyal men in their place. Whatever the matter is, it is clear that JAP will only grow in importance in Spanish domestic security and party politics given its recent return to violent actions against perceived enemies of state."

sprd.235.d:0 "The time for democracy in Spain arrived in 1930, and in 1932, it died at the hands of the military. The republicans, naive as always, assumed a return to democracy would happen if the monarchy scraped by in the elections of 1937, but given how close the race was between Carlists and Syndicalists compared to our final tally, Accion Popular could not support the return to constitutional democracy, for it could lead to an election victory of our rivals later on. The damage this could do to the state of Spain is not hard to see, the Carlists would return Spain to feudalism while the syndicalists would sell us to France and follow their anarchist delusions, destroying the very pillars of what makes a Spaniard what he is today.\n\nHowever, it is clear that some form of local organization and decisionmaking must be permitted within the new state, though this will happen through natural societal structures and organizations, not through elected representatives and meddling parties who seek to push division and dangerous agendas. Families, local Catholic unions, municipal councils and religious layman groupings will be the new organs of organic democracy, maintaining citizen participation and civil rights but concentrating the legislative and executive power in the hands of a single party to avoid the chaos and division that occurs in parliamentary democracies, though in the case of the new monarchist Spain, some other parties are still allowed to exist at least for now, as Accion Popular lacks the needed strength to go after its rivals and regularly collaborates with them on most matters."

sprd.236.d:0 "The first executive action of UMN has been to curtail the power of the vipers within Spain’s political elite, the Freemasons who brought about the end of the monarchy originally in 1930 and tried to do so again mere months ago. It is clear that these conspiratorial clubs and groups have no love for the monarchy nor Hispanidad, the inherent fabric of Spanish soul. Their only aim is to drag Spain into their perceived modernity, stripping away all the characteristics of what makes a Spaniards different from the surrounding peoples and replacing them with the formless mass of some liberal “European identity”. This dystopian vision of the Spanish future was averted through the quick intervention of general Sanjurjo in 1932, and the might of the Spanish army destroyed the last gasp of Masonry during the separatist revolt.\n\nThe republican idealism will slowly wither away and die under the rule of our new kingdom, and in its place, a wholly Hispanic new state will rise, trusting its king, aristocrats and military professionals to lead it to greatness where the civilian politicians and soft bureaucrats failed. The utmost role of UMN will be to lead Spain on a resurgence towards greatness, but to achieve this, societal harmony must be achieved either by removing the undesirable elements, such as the Masons, troublemaking syndicalists or regionalist traitors, or through careful cooperation, negotiation and when the time calls for it, coercion. The ideas of Miguel Primo de Rivera’s Unión Patriótica will live on despite the lamented death of their originator.\n\nThe Supreme National Assembly, a body meant to propose and fine-tune new legislation for the government of Unión Monárquica Nacional, will be restored and the relic from the republican era, the near-defunct Cortes, will be fully abolished. The original dictatorship of Primo de Rivera made the error of trying to show this change as a provisional, temporary change that would eventually give way to some form of parliamentarism, but to UMN, this is the final form of governance. Spain cannot fall into the pit of liberal delusions anymore, there cannot be polarizing parliamentary democracy that would only invite vipers similar to the likes of Freemasons to form their little cliques and political machines. The government shall rule supreme with the king as their nominal head, though unlike previously with Alfonso XIII and his weak resistance to the dictatorship, UMN has made sure that the monarch’s position is not something that could cause issues to the powerful executive organs of Spain. Only the iron fist of the military and UMN will ensure the continued dominance of Hispanidad in the lives of Spaniards."

sprd.237.t:0 "Question of State Militias"
sprd.237.d:0 "The new national order of Unión Monárquica Nacional is inherently linked to the military and the clique of officers led by Jose Sanjurjo, and while the military is not particularly interested in ruling as a stratocracy, they still hold considerable power as the only force strong enough to contest the Carlists, anarchists and separatists. However, using the military as the shock troops of the UMN regime is both wasteful and difficult from a propaganda perspective, as it will simply alienate our citizens and make them think that the military is fully in control, not the uniting force of UMN’s apolitical and benevolent rule.\n\nNonetheless, the society itself must be militarized to a degree, as there are both domestic and international threats to our nation that must be overcome with the force of arms if no other solution can solve it, as was the case with the separatist devils. Commune of France views us as an existential threat, the Nationalists and Moroccans covet our possessions in Africa and the internal enemies may have been largely driven out of Spain for now but eventually they will return to undermine our rule. As a solution to the need for militarization of Spanish society, UMN government has decided to integrate the various para-military forces that collaborated with its general organization, and transfer them to a militia from the age of Primo de Rivera that saw a brief resurgence during the Catalan rising.\n\nLa Traza, an anti-Catalanist, Hispano-supremacist group following the example of the Carlist Sindicatos Libres, was originally made up of loyal followers of dictator Primo de Rivera, and while it was disbanded during the Republican years, its master Manuel Delgado Barreto, a former Maurist, reopened the militia during the Sanjurjada and supported the hunt for Catalan separatists between 1932 and 1937. Delgado, who has been a strong ally of UMN since its inception, has his supporters, primarily the son of dictator Primo de Rivera, Jose Antonio, as well as Eugenio Vegas Latapié. However, others, more orthodox members transitioning over from Unión Patriótica, such as UMN’s leader Rafael Benjumea y Burín and relatively moderate supporter José Gabilán have noted that the party should instead focus its efforts into resurrecting the Somatén, a parapolice formation originally created in Catalonia during the 1920s, which general idea is to protect the rights of landowners and private property, and to break strikes from syndicalists and socialists.\n\nThe exact nature of these forces was always quite varied, and some Somatén groups were little more than civilians with weapons. Primo de Rivera even banned the ownership of weapons from those not part of the organization, and while the Somatén was not particularly well-organized during the dictatorship, it was expanded to all of Spain, eventually becoming a sort of neighbourhood watch. This organization would allow for a more grassroots defence of Spain from agents who wish to destroy our eternal nation, but compared to La Traza it is quite amateurish and not particularly strong should the enemy be quite organized. Still, it is argued that the Somatén is less radical group and thus is not as risky for the regime as it is mostly a passive force, not the active group rooting out enemies of the state which always has a possibility of turning otherwise docile citizens towards radical causes out of protest."

sprd.238.d:0 "Early morning sun hung over Madrid, scorching the city streets with light. The new order under the authoritarian monarchists had settled in, and the avenues and boulevards of the old city replicated this, with Guardia Civil patrols marching by civilians, followed by militiamen from the ruling party’s youth organizations who hawkishly hunted dissidents. The crisis of recent years had left Spain’s mightiest cities scarred, and to many, Madrid had suffered the most. The paranoia in the air of the city was perhaps the strongest wound left by the civil conflict, as the citizens of Madrid fear bombings, assassinations or shootouts instigated by the anarchists or socialists. However, in recent weeks, the anarchist resistance has weakened. Guardia Civil, led primarily by general Sanjurjo himself, assisted by the Carabineros of Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer, have begun a series of pin-point crackdowns, utilizing demoralized anarchists as informants to open up anarchist cells for attacks, and while this does not always result in wanted results, it has greatly weakened CNT-FAI’s militancy. With the near total destruction of the Catalan anarchists during the uprising, the organization is buckling under the weight of the military, and numerous large scale massacres in towns such as Casas Viejas have led to further weakening of the remaining militant’s resolve. Many have attempted to escape to France, but with careful cooperation with regionalist forces, especially Liga Regionalista in Catalonia, the escape routes of anarchists have been mapped out and mostly blocked by Carabineros. Most anarchist cells in Madrid have been purged, and while some notorious fighters such as Buanaventura Durruti and Felix Likiniano in Basque Country still continue the fight, it is clear that the flame of CNT-FAI’s rebellion is on the verge of being snuffed out. The rank-and-file workers of the movement have already flooded into the new national unions established by the regime, and while it will take a while to deprogram these men from their anarcho-syndicalist delusions, it is yet another proof to the propaganda machine of new Spain that CNT-FAI was nothing more than a group of terrorists utilizing the past strife in Spain to further the aims of international syndicalism. With time, the new Catholic unions will erase the stain of red syndicalism."

sprd.239.t:0 "Formation of a Singular Spanish Union"
sprd.239.d:0 "With the destruction of anarchist and socialist unions, many Spanish workers have left behind the godless militancy within these organizations, and members of CNT, UGT, FNTT and many others are now converging to join the Catholic unions as these represent the last bastion of worker organization in Spain. However, many within the government’s new administration fear that the influx of former left-wing agitators will lead to an insidious takeover of these organizations through slow and meticulous infiltration, especially with Commune of France on our Eastern border. While most of the syndicalists have been removed from the Iberian peninsula one way or another, rooting these weeds fully would be a Herculean task, and for the time being we must be wary of false shepherds within the workers’ organizations.\n\nAs such, the current government proposes that the unions of Spain should be merged into one, centralized organization that can monitor the situation of smaller federal sections of the unions and intervene in their matters should they stray from the intended path of Catholic unionism. The new unions will be fully corporatist in organization, and their main goal is to promote harmony between the different actors of Spain, avoiding clashes between property owners and workers. Every union from Asturias to Andalusian coast will be integrated into the new organization, with even moderate left-wing unions dismantled and their members moved into new groups.\n\nThe members of Renovación Española and Acción Española support utilizing the ideas of Guillermo Rovirosa, a member of Acción Católica ecclesial movement, and his template of Catholic unionism named Hermandad Obrera de Acción Católica. HOAC would be administered separate from the regime, but with a strong connection to the Catholic church, and in the case of the new Spain, observed tightly by the military and regime. This would allow for some degree of mobility within the movement to avoid it becoming a full lackey of the regime and incapable of giving proper advice on matters of labour.\n\nHowever, the members of Unión Monárquica Nacional and Partido Nacionalista Español instead support the ideas of Eduardo Aunós Pérez, who has supported the recreation of Organización Corporativa Nacional, a syndicate organization of the Primo de Rivera era which supported the creation of workers’ and employers’ councils where five worker representatives and five employer representatives must agree on matters of labour contracts before they can be put into action. These councils will later evolve into councils of the corporation of each trade, which will ensure lack of labour conflicts through agreements of labour regulation, and should issues arise, they can be best suited to resolve them in as short of a timeframe as possible. Aunós’ idea is very much born out of social Catholicism, but actually evolved naturally into corporatism. While the original OCN supported the continuation of existing unions, one of the central leaders of UMN, Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, has supported the merging of existing unions into a new national union, Movimiento Español Sindicalista, which would integrate the existing unions under a single entity, with the OCN’s councils acting as a overseer body to MES.."

sprd.241.d:0 "The separatist revolts showed, without a shadow of a doubt, that the nature of Spain’s minorities is fickle. For centuries they have been loyal, yet at the smallest sight of slight societal turbulence, they may get seditious thoughts and, as was more than evident, capitalize on any perceived weakness in the Madrid government. However, as can be expected from the mighty España, we crushed such insolent traitors, but while the people of Spain can now breathe easily once more as the drums of war have silenced, the lingering doubt that a scenario of similar nature could happen in the future, remains.\n\nAs the followers of José Calvo Sotelo and his Renovación Española have taken the reins of governance as ordained by the king, they have set upon to fix this glaring issue gnawing at the governors of Spain. Calvo Sotelo, an ardent follower of Charles Maurras’ ideas, has not always agreed on Maurras’ localist policies, as he viewed the republican era ideas of wide autonomy given to Spain’s minority regions as a mistake.\n\nHowever, Renovación Española has since revisited the issue, and unlike many other parties in Spain today, such as Acción Popular and Unión Monárquica Nacional, RE believes that a degree of regional autonomy may just save Spain from dealing with a similar issue further down the line. The rights given to the regions of Catalonia and Basque Country will not be as large as those planned by republicans originally, but Calvo Sotelo believes that Spain’s minorities must be autonomous ‘with an umbilical cord’, always linking the autonomous territories to Spain through shared cultural, religious and societal structures. The local municipal councils and other houses of governance will be able to conduct many of their functions according to local traditions and societal standards, as long as they do not clash with the ideas of Castilian central government. Any ideas or plans of secession will be harshly dealt with, but as long as the regions submit under the authority of Madrid in national-level matters, it is hoped that Renovación Española might just pacify the stubborn Basques and Catalans."

sprd.242.d:0 "The new state of Spain under the monarch Jaime and the strong arm of Renovación Española must avoid the pitfalls of both the republican government and the dictatorships that preceded and succeeded it. A wholly new structure must be imposed on Spain, one of totalitarian nature, but benevolent to its people. The call of unity must overcome all differences, be they class, religious or regional. The new state will be based on the ideas of Victor Pradera, and his magnum opus El Estado Nuevo, that outlines a new Spain based on the old models, especially the era of Catholic Monarchs in Spain. The new Spain would be a corporate one, overcoming the social antagonisms of liberal democracy or absolute monarchy, focused on alleviating social tensions and wholly destroying the cursed legacy of capitalism in Spain.\n\nThe new regime must create a mystique of totalitarianism, a state which perpetuates itself through the ideals of Hispanism, monarchism and strong governance, through a cult of venerating Spain’s glorious history. The economy will be directed by the state, and unionism will be formalized through Catholic organization, through the utilization of existing agrarian and industrial unions such as Sindicato Católico de Obreros Mineros, Juventud Obrera de Acción Católica and most importantly, Confederación Nacional Católico-Agraria, will be simply integrated to Renovación Española’s new state. Some members of the government have even proposed imposing an unification of these unions into a singular, highly decentralized but centrally controlled federation of trade unions, though the integration of these unions is a more pressing matter for now. The new state shall hold an absolute ironclad hierarchy, imposing law and order to dispel any notions of dissent swiftly. Under Renovación Española, the vibrant nationalism and patriotic fervour shall be combined on the altar of worship to the one, indivisible Homeland of all Spaniards, until nothing remains but the unfettered, pure Hispanidad of the Spanish people."

sprd.243.d:0 "The monarchy has graced the theorists and monarchist nationalists of Accion Española with the right to rule, but now the association must set on a voyage to define itself as a political organization separate from its two, more defined rivals, Renovación Española and Unión Monárquica Nacional. While AE shares many elements with both of these parties, the perhaps greatest defining trait of its leader Ramiro de Maetzu is his concept of Hispanidad. Maetzu, a member of the Generation of ‘98, took the loss of Spain’s last colonies harshly, and came up with the concept of Hispanidad to utilize as a blueprint on what the new Spanish nationalism would look like. He believes that despite the differences that Spain’s many minorities have towards the dominant Castilians, all the different peoples of Iberia still share the same Hispanic macroculture, which binds them far more than whatever perceived small peculiarities entities such as Galicians, Basques and Catalans may possess.\n\nHis idea of Hispanidad is an evolution of the ideas of the famed Spanish academic Miguel de Unamuno, who saw Hispanidad as an egalitarian stance on La Raza, where the various Spanish colonies were sister republics to the mainland Spain, not offspring. Maetzu, on the other hand, believes that the shared values in Catholicism and cultural norms are the most important aspect of Hispanidad, and his vision does not trip to the pitfall of egalitarianism and liberalism. Thus, despite their betrayal, the approach towards these minorities should remain paternalistic but fair.\n\nThe separatists were clearly goaded to this insurrectionary action by forces beyond our control, be they the slow and rotting influence of liberalism on the Spanish psyche, the insidious work of Communards saboteurs or the republican remnants hiding amidst various regionalists. Acción Española shall work with regional loyalists, such as Catalan Lliga Regionalista and Peña Blanca, Basque Liga de Acción Monárquica and Unión Navarra and Galician Dereita Galeguista to reaffirm ties towards these minority peoples, and transform the hatred and vitriol their people share into common understanding under the wider Hispanist moniker. Of course, there will be harsh retributions to the leaders of the treacherous revolt, but for the most part, we must be gentle with the locals. Only those truly lost will have to be punished, for the rest we shall guide them towards the light of Hispanidad and teach these wayward peoples just how unique the connection between Castile and her many brethren on Iberian peninsula truly is.

sprd.244.d:0 "Acción Española originally was not a party by any means, but a collection of ultraconservative nationalists, integralists and integrists as well as the occasional Carlist, all circulating around the newspaper of the same name. As such, the transformation into a proper party has not been an easy one, and debates on the ideological direction of the party have been fiery, with a few strings of consistency acting as the main thread of debate, such as Ramiro de Maetzu’s idea of Hispanidad, anti-regionalist fervour of Víctor Pradera and general disdain for both Freemasons and Jewish shared by many members of the movement. Beyond that, concepts on what direction the party should take are hardly uniform, with many members such as Marquis of Quintanar, Fernando Gallego de Chaves Calleja, supporting Lusitanian-style integralism, while others such as Emilio Ruiz Muñoz support adopting Integrist ideas, pointing out that no other ideology in Iberia is quite as strongly Catholic as the fundamentalists of Integrism.\n\nHowever, many view Integrism as wholly tainted by its association with Carlism, a notion that is not entirely untrue given that the formed was very much an evolution of Carlist ideas. A minority within Acción Española also support the ideas of Leon Degrelle, a famed Walloonian radical right-wing activist and fiery defender of Catholicism, to act as an inspiration for the new party, as his ideas are similar to those of Charles Maurras, but less defined and not as steeped in the positivism of Maurras, something that made the French ideologue less attractive as an inspiration to members of Acción Española.\n\nFinally, a small section of the new party has converged around José Pemartín, a strong traditionalist ideologue, who advocates for supporting the Latin monarchies of Europe to combat the Communard threat, and even collaborating with Germany, as according to Pemartín, the defeat of the Communards and the likely union of the two German powers in Europe would slowly Catholicize the continent, leading to a new Holy Roman Empire to be a likely conclusion, helped along by the power of Catholic, traditionalist Spain. Pemartín is very much a typical Catholic traditionalist, but his ideas have been called broadly Paneuropeanist as well, breaking from the typical Hispanist line of the party. His support is relatively tiny, however, but the ideas of reigniting Catholic domination in Europe have caused many nationalists within the party to align with Pemartín."

sprd.245.d:0 "José Pemartín has always been rather prominent in his support for the monarchy and Spanish speciality as a nation, but recently his ideas have shifted to what could be described as Mediterranean or Catholic exceptionalism. Pemartín supports Germany in the upcoming clash against Syndicalism, but in his eyes, it will only lead to a return to traditionalism as the machinations of modernist and godless forces are driven from Europe, the grip of corrupting ideas of socialism, Freemasonry and ‘international Jewish conspiracy’ pried open to suffocate the true soul of Europe nevermore. Pemartín believes that it would lead to the unification of Germany and Austria, in turn propelling Germany back into Catholicism.\n\nAll these developments would cascade into a new Holy Roman Empire, built around traditional values, Catholicism and the more developed nationalities supporting the younger nations like Germany to reach their true potential. In Pemartín’s vision, this utopia of the Spanish right would then adopt ideals from the Mediterranean cradle of civilization and act as a bulwark against future attacks by godless civilizations of other continents. However, Pemartín’s critics have pointed out that for his ideals to come to pass, plenty of things he has prophesied will have to come to pass, including a German victory in the Weltkrieg, an unification with Austrian and a return to Catholicism.\n\nThis would likely be a hardly possible scenario given the recent nationalism in Germany and a still relatively large Protestant population, as well as their entire monarchic house being made up of Protestants. Some of the most ardent supporters of Pemartín have even claimed that Spain should not be a passive bystander, instead seeking to unite the continent by force of arms, especially now that Spain is a resurgent power and rebuilding from centuries of bad governance. While Pemartín still believes in his own vision, the critics have made him reconsider the matter, and it is possible that he could cave to pressure and seek unification by sword."

sprd.246.d:0 "Acción Española has always been somewhat of a melting pot, gathering traditionalist and conservative thinkers from both sides of the dynastic divide among its writers and later, as politicians. While the relations between Alfonsists and Carlists have vexed and waned over the years, it’s safe to say that following 1932, any hope of negotiations seemed unlikely. Yet now that Acción Española has seized the state apparatus and a less controversial king, one that the Carlists were originally willing to compromise on, sits on the throne, it seems that battlelines are slowly fading away.\n\nMany Carlist hardliners fell alongside separatist scum, hellbent on seeing the Madrid regime fall even if it meant seeing Eternal Spain fracture, but the more rational members of the Traditionalist Communion have started to see the error of their ways. Many are now crawling back to us, realizing that continuing to support the seditious claims of their pretender will only lead Spain to further division and ruin. Former Carlists are already approaching us in droves, and many within AE view this situation as the most auspicious to start negotiations to fully absorb the Communion into part of our organization.\n\nThis would obviously somewhat affect our party structure in the short term, but the abilities and prowess of Carlist politicians and officers cannot be understated, and their connections to the regional parties would help us further pacify the separatist regions. After nearly a decade of fraternal infighting, Spain’s monarchist forces may finally unite under one traditionalist and wholly loyal front, to forevermore watch over Eternal Spain and to stand guard against the dual devils of liberalism and syndicalism."

sprd.248.d:0 "With the ascension of Partido Agrario Español to power, Spain now waits with bated breath as to what the future will hold for the nation. The threat posed by militias is the most important as of now, as the unity of Spanish right is not as strong after the defeat of their strongest foes. The various militias of the parties are often led by less than stable or overly ambitious individuals, and keeping such volatile powderkegs around the new Spanish state is simply unacceptable. The Agrarians plan to reform the military after a period of settling into the leadership of the nation, and their plan includes a relatively large downsizing of the military from navy to the army, where the old and obsolete weapons are sold in exchange of less, but better, armaments, and the same will apply to the military men, both the number of soldiers and the amount of officers. The new Spanish army will be a centralized, professional and effective force, and this reorganization will have no room for paramilitary political forces, no matter how experienced they may be at cracking skulls on the streets of Spain’s cities. By using the military to dismantle the militias one by one, the Agrarian leadership, especially the leader of the party José Martínez de Velasco, hopes that the other parties will not support various military radicals once they find themselves without work after the downsizing of Spain’s military. Additionally, given that PAE lacks a proper militia force of their own, the act of removing the rival parties’ militias from the streets will only benefit the public image and popularity of PAE at the expense of their rivals. Some naysayers are commenting that this will provoke the rival militias to act against the state, but given that the king and military stand behind the Agrarians, this is hardly a frightening scenario."

sprd.249.d:0 "The new government of Partido Agrario Español is hardly something that was expected of a new, authoritarian Spain, either by the republican traitors or the militant radicals of Spanish right. Yet perhaps this is why PAE was chosen to lead the nation, as despite their overtly monarchist sympathies and strong support for national values, be they in terms of religion, gender relations or societal organization, the PAE is very much a force for slow, steady and meticulous progress, unlike many radical members of Renovación Española or Traditional Communion, who wish to return to the distant path. PAE instead looks only slightly to the past, observing Admiral Berenguer’s period as the head of Spain as a certain new inspiration. PAE has always supported strong centralism, not massively at the expense of regional actors but simply to ensure that the sacred unity of Spain is never threatened by the separatist, syndicalist or other radicals. As such, Berenguer’s Dictablanda period may very well serve as a great template for PAE’s reforms, as the party has no future plans to reinstate a form of parliamentary democracy. Instead, the party will continue to uphold the rights of Spain’s citizenry, keeping them from harmful delusions such as liberalism, progressivism and republicanism, while providing reforms at a pace that are the complete opposite of the republican harmful strategy of trying to drive through multiple radical shifts in Spanish society. There are things within the Republican program that are not wholly destructive, and many within PAE support their adoption in a slightly updated form, such as laws of regional autonomy, military reform and other minor additions, yet other ideas are completely unacceptable, such as Republican ideas of secularism and agrarian reform. The heartlands of Spain in Leon and Castile will see some degree of change in rural organization, but PAE will ensure that this is done fairly and not in the socialist mockery of justice that was attempted in 1932. The new Spain under PAE will be one of decisive action, slow progress and benevolent, respectful government, but not one that will share its power with those that do not have the means to ensure the same, if they were to get into power."

sprd.250.d:0 "Unión Patriótica, the party created in support of general Miguel Primo de Rivera’s regime and soon absorbed to be the sole party of the dictatorship, has long been an inspiration to the Spanish right. Sad reality is that the union was unsuccessful in its aims to create an apolitical movement aimed solely at uniting the Spanish people on the fundamentally excellent values of Catholicism and corporatism. Yet from seeds of failure PNE must grow a new union, following in the values of Primo de Rivera into a new dawn. The ideas of national unionism and Catholic restructuring of the entire society will be implemented country-wide, and the values of Fatherland, Faith and Monarchy will be drilled into the heads of Spanish youth in the heavily-sponsored new education of PNE so they may never stray to republicanism or syndicalism ever again.\n\nUnder the king’s watchful eye, we will attempt to merge the values of Unión Patriótica in a new way, creating local branches of PNE that will allow it to fit local conditions better, while still supporting the core values of our ideology, taking note from the success of Accion Popular in federalizing itself into multiple smaller parties in different regions that can further create grassroots agitation for this new vision of Spain. This new direction, partially inspired by the Carlists in its function given Albinana’s fascination with traditionalism, will focus on the core ideals of country, religion and monarchy as the pillars of Spanish society. However, one part where our new party structure will differ from the original ideals of Unión Patriótica is in the continued utilization of Albinana’s Legionaries.\n\nWhile majority of the movement will consist of ‘neutral men of pious faith and good ideas’, Albinana’s Legionaries will always be there, in the shadows, preying on any socialist or syndicalist guerillero who dares to intervene in the creation of a pure, loyal Spanish state. Another idea taken directly from the original ideas of Primo de Rivera is the recreation of Somatén, a rural defence force especially in Catalonia that will ensure the rights of property owners and punish the eternal threat of Marxist infiltration into our loyal farmer folk."

Albiñana, a doctor by trade, has always had an interest in eugenics, and his ideas of Hispanic race coincide with those of the famous father of right-wing nationalist Hispanism, Ramiro de Maetzu. Together, they outlined the idea of Hispanic supremacy, stemming from the values of Catholicism, traditionalism and martial prowess, and in the eyes of Albiñana, the utter crushing of regionalist ambitions under the heel is the only way for Spain to retain this essence of spiritual and physical being.\n\nHowever, separatists alone are not the main foe of Hispanidad, for Albiñana believes that it is the Freemason and the Jew who seek to truly ruin the imperial legacy of Spain and betray her on the altar of modern decadence. Only through surgical precision of the iron surgeon’s scalpel can this festering wound within the skin of Spain be removed, and the Legionaries of Albiñana shall serve as their master’s precise instrument. For too long have the republican and syndicalist mongrels threatened the Eternal España, yet their final reckoning shall come, until not a single heretic, infidel or godless abomination shall walk the sacred lands of Santiago. With the Commune of Sin right across the Pyrenees hanging over our pious peninsula like the Sword of Damocles, there can be no rock to hide under for the enemies of the regime.\n\nWhile Albiñana supports further militarization of Spain and the expansion of its elite branches, he wishes to enhance the bite of the monarchy and ruling party by further reinforcing his Legionaries with volunteers from other parties and militias, as according to Albiñana, these men can go where the Guardia Civil or Spanish army would make too much noise and commotion. Loyal sons of Spain shall act as the first line of defence against deviation from the sacred duty towards the monarchy and Hispanic unity. These men can then later become career soldiers and officers with the experience gained from hunting the detritus of Spain’s population, further creating a symbiosis of PNE and the military."

sprd.252.d:0 "The inner politics of Partido Agrario have received a near total revision after the sudden uplift in their power upon becoming the legal government of Spain. While originally a party of landowners of both large and medium-sized estates, united in their support for the monarchy of Alfonso XIII and their dislike of the republican agrarian reform, it’s new role as the sentinel of Spanish politics has caused their membership to soar. This has mostly come at the cost of the large estate owners, as their ranks have diminished in the far larger party, and the number of smallholders now establishing themselves within the party is growing. As such, a sort of ideological divide has started to emerge within PAE, leading to clashes of opinion between the more aristocratic leadership and more populist middle and lower class smallholders. As new members join the party, more and more members of PAE are now calling for a genuine reform into the ownership and utilization of lands in Spain.\n\nThe aristocrats who own many of Spain’s latifundios resist these changes tooth and nail, and in the event of a continued push for reform, may entrench their position as the top leaders of the party, ejecting the more firebrand reformists out and creating a party ruled by Spain’s rural oligarchs, caciquismo and aristocrats. These nobles possess plenty of capital to back their takeover of the party, but they lack popular support, and should their opponents be able to push their policies through, it possible these large landowners would bend to the will of the people, as long as the reforms are relatively mild. The reformists generally follow the ideas of Joaquin Costa, the father of Spain’s regenerationism and a known supporter of a more right-wing tendency of the American reformist ideologue, Henry George.\n\nCosta’s reforms would see the creation of more arable land for wider use, through town gardens, repeal of the disentailment laws and when possible, through leasing and renting land. This careful redistribution of land would help lift the burden on Spain’s poorest farmers, and while it would temporarily hurt the owners of latifundios, a large benefit would be that the new farmer class would be less susceptible to famines and economic downturns, and by proxy, to the promises of anarchists and agrarian socialists. Georgist tax reform would also see the elimination of certain labour taxes, perhaps not to the extent  The entire base of PAE, even excluding the large landholders, are not in agreement with these new ideas, and instead support the continuation of more generalized agrarian policies of slow, meticulous reform. However, this group is generally caught between the two rival factions and unless it is able to convince one of the other segments of PAE to back down, the ‘true’ agrarians hold no real chance of reinforcing the party line."

This would leave the military matters to the men better suited for it, and allow civilians to transfer Spain to a time before the Sanjurjada coup, where the military was not so intertwined with the governance of the state.\n\nHowever, with the king’s opinion still dubious, Sanjurjo has instead supported a something of a merger of the conservative and militarist approaches, allowing Spain to return to a traditional Catholic governance but with a strong military man leading the nation towards this destiny, with a mix of civilian and military adjutants to rely on. Sanjurjo draws much of his ideas from the French bulwark of reaction, Philippe Petain and his ideology of Révolution Nationale. However, some within Sanjurjo’s inner circle support ditching the monarchist conservatives altogether and simply creating a populist personality cult around the general Caudillo, propped up by the military.

With Austria being the leading Catholic nation of Europe, the leader of AN, José Maria Gil-Robles has always been an avid admirer and supporter of Engelbert Dollfuss, the ideological father of Austropopulism. While the Austrophiles are generally less strong among the party than the near hegemonic Germanophiles, Gil-Robles’ role as the party’s near indisputed boss has made his ideological leanings have far more weight than the faction otherwise would have.\n\nThe pro-German wing of AP on the other hand has increasingly called for Spain to adopt the Prussian constitutionalist system, allowing for a highly elitistic, limited democracy integrated into the existing organic democratic model of the party. This system would empower the monarch and his cabinet to a strong degree, allowing the king to check Cortes if need be.

According to Albiñana, the Spanish might stems from its social composition and inherited traits passed on by centuries of patriotic, pious men and women. However, lately due to the invention of harmful ideologies such as the separatist delusions of national self-determination for Spain’s linguistic minorities and of course, the snake in God’s garden of Earth, the devious syndicalists, have begun to impose a degeneration on this millenia-old Hispanic spirit. These socio-syndicalists seek to impose their view of a society not based on morality and tradition, but on some grand revolutionary ideas, ideas that have turned such world powers such as Britain and France into hideous nests of degenerates in the span of mere decades. Albiñana, and the brave men of Partido Nacionalista, have sought to prevent this from ever happening, and harsh measures will be taken to ensure that a similar scenario never comes to pass in the sacred soil of España. Orphans from recent battles against syndicalism and separatism will see themselves placed into new pious families, where religious ideals and patriotic fervour will act as a balm to turn them away from the godlessness of their biological parents. Those that can yet be redeemed, will be placed into programs of conversion to allow them to denounce their wicked past, and those that cannot, shall face exile or death. The Hispanic man is God’s greatest creation, and Dr. Albiñana, a man of science and faith, cannot allow any attempts to spoil this perfection. The separatists shall be dealt with through fusion of the best qualities of the Hispanic race, and hopefully, with the passing of time, these hybrid structures can be peeled away to give way to wholly Hispanized regions, free of nationalist lunacy. Meanwhile, great lengths will be taken by Hispanist eugenicists such as Misael Bañuelos to ensure that the development of research into the unique components of Spanish Raza are better understood and cultivated, until one day we can eliminate all harmful aspects still lingering from the syndicalist and separatist rot."

Some independent journalists have even claimed that the Count is looking to install a country-wide net of caciques, mobsters, corrupt businessmen and other unscrupulous individuals, who would help keep his rule of grift aloft for decades to come, while leaving the Count completely guilt-free in the eyes of the king. These lies are absolutely false, officially of course, but they are painting our regime in a bad light and thus must be dealt with. The Count’s supporters have recommended that the party seeks more avenues of concrete reform to ensure that the more extrajudicial matters of governance are not monitored as heavily, though the direction of these reforms remains unknown.\n\nPartido Fusionista could attempt to move the direction of the party into an even more economically liberal direction, while retaining the more socially conservative elements to appease the more right-wing parties of Spain. Alternatively, Romanones could attempt to flirt with the working class support by suggesting more pro-worker legislation, similar to his earlier career successes such as the eight-hour work day and expansion of teacher’s wages and rights. Some, however, suggest that we instead simply shut these nosy journalists up, either with a generous donation to allow them to pursue more interesting avenues of reporter work, such as the amazing reforms Partido Fusionista is pursuing, or finding a cozy new accommodation for them in Rio de Oro.

The party, noted for its pacifism, a rare trait in Spain of today so heavily dominated by the military and bloodthirsty paramilitaries, has long sought diplomatic approaches to various issues, and above all, it has held diplomatic dialogue as a source of political strength when dealing with other nations.\n\nThis has now manifested in the recent suggestion for a new program, as the PAE seeks to expand citizenship of Spain outside its borders, to the people of Latin America, given the recent creation of a military alliance with them. This rather unorthodox idea stems not only from Pan-Hispanist fervour, but also from the reality that Spain and its former colonies are each others strongest allies in these dire times, and thus cultural and national barriers must be secondary to the unity of the alliance. This program would obviously boost immigration to the Spanish mainland, but as many have pointed out, it is debatable whether the Spanish economy could survive such a surge in immigration, especially given the limited resources of our nation.\n\nYet as the Americans have proven, there is great strength in a strong influx of immigrants, and perhaps it could alleviate the troubles Spain has had with its minority regions of Catalonia, Basque Country and Galicia, where the immigrants would become a class of citizen in their own right, keeping the fire of separatist movements shackled. The program would also seek the creation of an economic union between the participant nations, and many Spaniards hope that the nations of the New World would expand their citizenship to their European Hispanic counterparts as well."

Many believe that it is only a matter of time until the king leaves his mortal coil, and despite his son now reigning on the throne, there are many who now publicly denounce the old king as a weak man who led Spain astray through his non-intervention and disinterest in ruling Spain. Alongside these political criticism, many have pointed out the king’s lack of moral integrity, and while Alfonso’s unfaithfulness to his wife Victoria Eugenie, especially with his mistress Carmen Ruiz Moragas, was a public secret, other secrets have come to light as well.\n\nDuring the street battles of the recent crisis, a group of Catalan separatists broke into the premises of a film studio known as Royal Films, owned by Ramón and Ricardo de Baños. Normally, such infractions would have been lost to the annals of time as Spain was gripped by a crisis of immense magnitude, but these troublemakers managed to snatch three film reels from the studio, and upon closer inspection at a local theatre, found them to be adult movies, filmed for the king Alfonso and commissioned by Count of Romanones himself. The Catalans managed to send these films to the local press organ of Estat Catala, which launched a public smearing campaign of the king. Chalked up as propaganda by the regime after the war, it has nonetheless called the moral failings of Alfonso into question once more, and by proxy, his accomplice Count of Romanones, the current de facto ruler of Spain.\n\nThe studio had produced over seventy movies for Alfonso, who had among the largest pornographic collections in the world, and now this situation is on the verge of becoming headline news all over Spain, should more of these reels leak to the public. Some have suggested selling off the company or nationalizing it, while more radical members of the Count’s cabinet suggest an arson attack on the studio to cover up the entire scheme and use it as a justification for further repression of the Catalans."

The Mexican revolution and its consequences had left the nation broken, with thousands dead, settlements burned to the ground or abandoned by their inhabitants and the resulting lack of identity being filled with indigenous or Indianist nonsense in the view of Albiñana. To him, the Mexican hatred for all things Spanish and their hell-bent desire to fuse their people with the local natives would only lead to the loss of their most unique trait, the Hispanic legacy of the nation’s founders.\n\nAlbiñana, who had started to develop his ideas of just what this Hispanic excellence composed of, became further radicalized by what he saw in Mexico, and it would lead to his hatred for all things republican and socialist even after his return to Spain. While PNE under Albiñana’s leadership has now purified Spain of these malignant tumors within the Hispanic psyche, Mexico still languishes under the iron fist of these delusional anti-Hispanists. The light of Catholicism has grown dim in the nation, with fanatics from the left and right alike seeking to destroy the influence of the Saints in the nation. \n\nNot only that, they gleefully attack anything considered even tangentially related to Spanish, seeking to eradicate the glorious legacy of Hernán Cortés and his conquistadors, who brought the Hispanic spirit to these lost lands. With the conquest of Spain complete and Albiñana’s tenure as the iron surgeon of the nation finally finalized, he now looks towards other glories, and with compassion, seeks to return to Mexico to perform the same surgical operation there as well. However, members of his inner circle, especially Manuel Delgado, see these plans as a waste of resources that could be used to improve the situation of Spain here. Yet there are many who anticipate the return of Mexico to the fold with glee, seeking to Hispanize the region once more and bring it into a ‘fraternal’ union with the Old Country."

The remote piece of land in Equatorial Guinea is hardly the crown jewel of Spanish colonial empire either, and the rebellious province of Rif has been a thorn in the nation’s side for quite some time. However, the conquest of Rif caused a new sense of Africanism to rise in Spain, and while most of this was concentrated towards gaining control of Morocco, there were some, such as Ramón Serrano Suñer, the firebrand of Juventudes de Accion Popular,  who are calling for Spain to retake the territories of Oran and Mers el Kebir, which were during the 16th and 18th century controlled by Spain for quite a long periods.\n\nIn addition to these claims, a considerable number of Spaniards moved to Algeria during the last century and early decades of the 20th century, due to the highly unstable political situation in Spain. The portion of population speaking Spanish, Catalan and Valencian has gone down with the arrival of French exiles, but there are still a noticeable portion of Spanish-population in the region. The more sensible nationalists within the government have noted that while claiming this territory would upset the French, our old allies during the Rif war, the facts backing up Suñer’s arguments are not particularly weak.

sprd.261.d:0 "The two giants of Accion Popular politics, José María Gil-Robles and the now retired but highly venerable Ángel Herrera Oria, did not pop into Spanish politics from nowhere. Herrera was one of the central members of an organization that would come to define much of Spain’s Catholic right, the Asociación Católica de Propagandistas founded by jesuit Ángel Ayala at the start of the century, and Gil-Robles was among the most prominent monarchists among the organization even before the arrival of Accion Popular. ACdP is primarily aimed at promoting Catholicism at every level of society, and combating the pervasive elements of French-style secularism on Spanish society. It seeks to create a group of powerful and populist Catholic actors, be they political or ecclesiastical, who can mobilize Christian forces towards the goal of promoting social Catholicism.\n\nWhile the group was hardly uniform in ideology, with some coming from Carlism, such as Víctor Pradera, or from Basque nationalism, such as José Antonio Aguirre and yet others coming from Alfonsine monarchism or Christian democracy, such as Gil-Robles and Herrera themselves, the overall goals of the group were relatively uniform and political affiliations rarely played a part in the general ideals of the group, at least not in a negative sense. As Accion Popular now controls Spain, Herrera, who still follows the party’s trajectory mostly without intervention, has proposed full incorporation, or at least a partial collaboration, with the group, given that AP is the primary political actor of Spain now.\n\nThe strength of ACdP would come not only from the leadership training its members can provide, but also from the plethora of sub-functions the party has, such as the newspaper El Debate, the student group Centro de Estudios Universitarios, the Logos publishing house and the agrarian reform group Círculo de Estudios Agrarios. However, the question remains whether the party should formally integrate ACdP, something that is likely to not cause too many protests given how the organization was moulded by AP members, or to keep the two entities separated but tightly linked in co-operation. Gil-Robles supports integration, but Fernando Martín-Sánchez Juliá, the current president of ACdP has been hesitant, citing that he prefers to keep the non-political nature of the organization to allow it to be a non-partisan actor for the furtherment of Catholic causes."

sprd.262.t:0 "Truly Catholic Unions"
sprd.262.d:0 "The Catholic unionist program has always had its issues in Spain due to multitude of factors. Firstly, the anarchist and socialist unions have been quite effective as siphoning members off Catholic unions, claiming that Catholic unions cannot achieve true workers’ organization and seek to merely empower the employer classes. Secondly, the various Catholic factions of Spain have never been able to truly unite the different unions, with the Carlists having their own Sindicatos Libres, the Basques with their Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna and the Alfonsists with a variety of national and federal level unions, such as Confederación Nacional Católico Agraria, the largest Catholic agrarian union in Spain.\n\nNow that Accion Popular holds absolute power, things can be different. With the help of the existing loyal unions, and those from the rebellious unions who have since seen reason, a new program has been initiated by the Ministry of Labour to see a merging of industrial unions into a singular confederation, similar to the CNCA, under the new name of Confederación Española de Sindicatos Obreros. This would allow the workers of Spain a means to ensure that they are not exploited but instead receive their fair share, but it also has the benefit of keeping the syndicalists out of workplaces. To make sure that the workers have capable unionist leaders, the brainchild of Ángel Herrera, Instituto Social Obrero, shall be put to use training the new leadership of CESO. ISO is primarily an sub-division of Asociación Católica de Propagandistas, but unlike ACdP, which seeks to train laymen in the expansion of Catholicism, ISO will train pious workers into true Christian leaders capable of teaching social Catholicism and corporatism to the masses of Spain’s proletariat.\n\nAfter all, as Herrera put it, ‘There can be no man of action without being a man of prayer. He who wishes to bear fruit through his action must be a man of great interior life’. As such, there can be no true worker organization without Christian ideals. However, other members of the Labour Ministry have suggested that we go beyond just the establishment of CESO, and create the Federación Española de Trabajadores, a massive union incorporating both CESO and CNCA. This is prone to overburdened bureaucracy and over-centralization without proper care put into the organization of it, but FET would likely be an even faster and stronger way to truly create a country-wide Catholic unionist movement, bringing the false shepherds of Spain’s left back to the light."

Upon seeing Spain triumph against its many enemies, Ledesma publicly renounced his past as the leader of Spain’s national syndicalists, and called for a new, truly nationalist and right-wing syndicalism to take over instead. He even went as far as to call for the rebranding of ‘national syndicalism’, saying that Mussolini, Mosley and Valois alongside their goons had perverted the true sense of class unity his original vision sought, replacing it with proletariat dominance.\n\nUpon hearing of the unification of all Spain’s Catholic unions into Federación Española de Trabajadores, he came out of hiding to appeal to the government that his organization would be allowed to join it. Many saw this as complete nonsense, as Ledesma’s organization had been part of the left-wing forces terrorizing Spain for ages, but many more saw an opportunity. A former left-wing demagogue publicly announcing his support for Catholic unionism, especially with his atheism being well-known to the public, would be a massive gain to the new unions recruitment. While risky, many believe that should JONS be integrated into FET, there could be a massive uptick in former syndicalist members to the union."

The man claims no allegiance to the crown of Spain, and some, such as José Calvo Sotelo and Antonio Goicoechea, have even accused him of being a republican, though calling him a liberal one similar to the effeminate men in Izquierda Republicana and Partido Radical would likely earn one the full wrath of JCAH. Nonetheless, the party is a disputed one among Spain’s right, and many view it with suspicion, but one cannot deny that JCAH shares the very same Hispanist values of Acción Española.\n\nThus, in a meeting earlier today, important members of Acción Española and JCAH met in Madrid to discuss a possible merging of the two parties into one. Redondo demanded further and heavier actions against what he called conspiratorial forces, primarily Jews, due to his deep-seated hatred for this religious group. His organization, and especially its militant wing, who participate in the infamous dawn patrols meant to hunt syndicalists, Freemasons and other enemies of state alike, would be incorporated as the primary paramilitary arm of Acción Española, as the party does not possess a proper militant arm as of now. In exchange for a place within the party, Redondo is merely expected to rescind his previous accidentalist stances and fully commit to monarchism, which he has agreed to do. It seems that one by one, the parties of Spain will be consolidated under one wing and purpose."

sprd.265.t:0 "Maurismo Redeemed"
sprd.265.d:0 "The influence of Antonio Maura, the behemoth of Spanish Restoration era conservative politics, on José Calvo Sotelo, Spain’s new prime minister, cannot be understated. While Calvo Sotelo has since progressed towards new ideological directions, such as Maurrasisme, he started his political career as a firm follower of Maura, and his party Renovación Española, has long been divided into the more Maurist conservative wing of Antonio Goicoechea and the more totalitarian wing of Calvo Sotelo. However, despite the large number of Maurists within the party, the sons of Antonio Maura, especially Gabriel Maura Gamazo and Miguel Maura, have mostly remained aloof to it, siding more with the liberal conservative, and even at times, the republican tendencies of their father.\n\nHowever, thankfully the legacy of their father is not truly tarnished, for a rising star with RE is seeking to revive their father’s legacy fully and redeem Maurism as a new part of the ideology of Calvo Sotelo. Honorio Maura, the third of Antonio’s sons, has denounced the liberal tendencies of his brothers and fully committed to Spanish Maurrasisme, calling for a truly national, authentic revolution that will save Spain from liberals and syndicalists alike. The strife of last half a decade has taken its toll on the man, and while he was originally less hard on republicanism, he has lost any patience for such systems. A strong personal friend of Alfonso XIII, he has served as an important councillor to young Jaime, and he has been instrumental in diplomatic ties to the Austria-Hungarian empire thanks to his bank Banco Hispano-Austro Húngaro operating there. Outside of his party role, Maura has been an important member of the new regime’s propaganda, since his large passion has always been the creation and directing of plays.\n\nKnown for his comedy theatre plays, he often depicts aristocratic and bourgeois settings through ironic, at times frivolous yet equally glamorizing portraits, simultaneously provoking the decadent nobility of Spain for their inability to keep up with the times, while also showing them in a highly idealized and propagandized tone. His greatest works have been a play depicting the fall of the monarchy in Spain, as well as a play turned into a proper film by Paramount, Susana tiene un secreto, which has been one of the first Spanish blockbusters. Some within the regime have supported Maura in seeking help from CIFESA to produce more domestic classics, yet it remains to be seen whether he takes up the offer. Nonetheless, it would appear that the despite the triumph of Calvo Sotelo and the decline of the Maurist wing within RE, a new form of Maurism is very much alive and well."

sprd.266.d:0 "The grip of José Calvo Sotelo upon Spain is starting to become unbreakable, and the ideas of Maurrasisme have been put into action, leading to a rather heavy decentralization of the regime, the implementation of true organicism and the expansion of the RE’s own combat squads, the Green Berets, who have seen an increased adoption of similar tactics and uniformity as their French Camelots du Roi counter-parts. However, everything has not gone as smoothly as many within RE may have hoped, and the introduction of localist policies within the minority regions of Spain have been a headache as many Castilians view the population of these regions with immense suspicion.\n\nSome have also criticized RE for being too aristocratic in nature and detached from the people, ruling with the Green Berets and lofty ideals but not much love for the true common people. A minority within Renovación Española have thus turned to support the ideas of Leon Degrelle, a famed Walloonian radical right-wing activist and fiery defender of Catholicism, to act as an inspiration for the new party, as his ideas are similar to those of Charles Maurras, but less defined and not as steeped in the positivism of Maurras, something that made the French ideologue less attractive as an inspiration to members of Renovación Española.\n\nThey view Degrelle’s fiery populism as a great example for what RE should stand for if it truly wishes to win the hearts of Spaniards, as while Calvo Sotelo is known for being a charismatic and talented orator, his appearances before the masses have been relatively limited. Calvo Sotelo and his allies have pointed out that the difference between this Rexist thoughtform and that of Maurras is not massive, but the party is increasingly less opposed to the change in direction, simply for the sake of change."

As such, the government, previously relatively hesitant to react to the crisis due to the very controversial nature of it, has been forced into action after constant demands by Instituto de Reforma Agraria. IRA, despite its small size and low level of influence, has been bolstered as one of the last remaining bastions of republican intellectualism, given it was heavily staffed by republicans before Sanjurjada and still retains a degree of those individuals in its ranks.\n\nWhile the agrarian reform will be a difficult task to guide into final stages, and many controversial and difficult tasks must be undertaken to finally see Spain leave behind its primitive and inefficient form of rural organization, it is of utmost importance to the new government, and as such the second phase of reforms has been initiated in a highly rushed manner.

sprd.268.t:0 "National or Popular?"
sprd.268.d:0 "The rule of Accion Popular right now is nigh absolute over Spain, but recently, a memory from the party’s past has been resurrected. Originally, when Ángel Herrera Oria created the party to be an extension of his interpretation for the mission of Asociación Católica de Propagandistas, the party was not known as Accion Popular but by the title Acción Nacional. This change was forced upon the party by the republicans, who banned the use of the word Nacional for political purposes and allowed it to only be used in reference to state administration and other official Spanish government purposes.\n\nAfter the coup of 1932, there was quite a bit of confusion in relation to whether general Sanjurjo would reinstate some form of republicanism, and only after Accion Popular was installed as the ruling party under the returned king Alfonso was this confusion answered, but by then the name of the party had mostly solidified, so in an effort to create a facade of a return towards democracy eventually, the party name was kept as Accion Popular. However, now that AP rules as the hegemon of Spain’s right, the republicans are all either assimilated under its rule or driven outside of politics and the socialists are dead or in exile, there is no reason to keep up appearances, and thus many have proposed the return of the Acción Nacional name. While not a massive change in any case, there is some division within the party in relation to this, with many so accustomed to the current name that they see no need to change it."

sprd.269.d:0 "After Partido Agrario’s rise to power and the earning of king’s favour, the party has had a hard time restructuring itself to fully fit this task. Perhaps the strongest weakness of the party remains the same as always, its crippling inability to attract mass following due to its rather elitist nature, the prominence of agrarian syndicalism and socialism in peasant politics and the rivals the party has in unions and organizations of other parties, such as the Confederación Nacional Católico-Agraria heavily controlled by Accion Popular. PAE suffers equally from possessing no union of its own, as it has never expanded into more peasant-level politics or Catholic unionism, relying solely on its supporter-base in large and medium landowners. \n\nHowever, now that the party has the king’s favour and is, at least for the time being, fully in control with its rival parties struggling to cope with their defeat, the party could attempt to rectify this issue fully. Most popular option within the party, especially among its elite, would be to absorb CNCA, as its leader, Ricardo Cortes Villasana, leads his own minor party alongside Juan Diaz Caneja called the Unión Castellana Agraria. If PAE were to propose the integration of UCA into its own party, it is likely that UCA would approve this. However, they are known to be among the few existing Castilian regionalists, and it’s highly likely that the party would demand autonomy for Castile in the event of integration. There are, thankfully, other options. While not an union per se, the employer organization Agrupación de Propietarios de Fincas Rústicas de España holds considerably sway over Spain’s agrarian matters, wields enormous monetary and material resources and is of a general conservative ideology when it comes to agrarian matters, and many members of PAE are also members of APFRE. However, this does not necessarily solve our issues with getting actual popular support, but it would increase the resources with which PAE can pursue this cause, and additionally, would allow us to get into the good graces of the remaining large landowners that are not involved with our party yet.\n\nHowever, the rival of APFRE may be an even more lucrative option. The nearly six decade old organization, Asociación de Agricultores de España, has long clashed with APFRE over agrarian reformism, as AAE is more clearly reformist rather than pro-status quo. AAE is more of an organization for smaller local organizations, possessing both unions, agrarian credit groups and co-operatives all over Spain, and should we be able to integrate it, it would significantly boost our popularity. However, the spread-out and decentralized nature of AAE does make it somewhat hard to fully control, and it’s likely that some of these smaller organizations would break off and become independent entities upon learning of this integration. Nonetheless, out of the options present, AAE may very well be the one with least amount of compromising needed to achieve an integration with."

Much of this criticism has been leveled at the prime minister’s relationship with his sister, as Maria de Maetzu has been allowed to continue her operations within the feminist clubs Residencia de Señoritas and Lyceum Club Femenino.\n\nKnown for being far more liberal than her brother, Maria is one of the key feminists of Spain and her clubs have seen other prominent women politicians and intellectuals of the era, such as the Radical-Socialist demagogue Victoria Kent, the feminist artist Concha Méndez and the poet Zenovia Camprubí. Maria, who is known nation-wide as a strong proponent of education, and the premise of LCF and RdS is to provide women greater access to higher education, as well as facilitate the transition of women to workforce by creating daycare centres and other aides to daily life. This development was, even at the beginning of their activity in the 1920s, furiously attacked by the conservative sectors of Spain, with many claiming that this would only lead to the fracturing of traditional society and family structure.\n\nThe Catholic church especially attacked the organization, and some priest went as far as to call for the women to be locked away to avoid the spreading of such dangerous ideas. However, now that Spain is utterly dominated by the right-wing conservative forces, these calls have grown even louder, and many view the prime minister’s disinterest as either a sign of weakness or even quiet approval of his sister’s measures. Some have even claimed that Ramiro de Maetzu’s past as a more progressive and even pro-syndicalist intellectual during the Weltkrieg may have resurfaced.

sprd.271.d:0 "Among the Spain’s monarchist officers, general José Sanjurjo stands out for multiple reasons. Whereas most of the military minds coalescing around monarchist ideas tend to subscribe to either Alfonsist or Carlist traditionalism, neoconservative Hispanism or Catholic corporatism, Sanjurjo has remained relatively apolitical throughout his career and supported monarchism mostly out of family tradition, his father having been a Carlist. He was one of the rare Spanish army officers in the high command who did not lament the fall of Primo de Rivera and the proclamation of the republic, despite his personal friendship with the former dictator, and Sanjurjo, as a commander of Guardia Civil, did not provide his support to the dictatorship’s mellowed successor when the republicans won the municipal elections and the idea of a suppression of these results was floated around the upper echelons of Spanish society.\n\nHowever, when Sanjurjo couped the government in 1932, it was clearly born out dislike for the chaos the new regime had wrought, and despite the restoration of the monarchy under him, Sanjurjo did initially seem to agree to a democratic restoration under a constitutional monarchy. However, the general was not interested in serving as a second Primo de Rivera, and he delegated power to Accion Popular, who in turn eschewed the return to democracy in favour of their own idea of a corporatist Spain, something the general did not seem to object publicly. Nonetheless, it would seem that Sanjurjo, now grown tired of the AP’s floundering regime, has returned to his original ideas, as the general has promised that a return to constitutionalism and parliamentarism may be in the horizon. No deadline is given for this transition, but apparently the king has agreed upon this.\n\nHowever, many experts assume that the authoritarian regime is only dropped after the war clouds dispel over Europe and the anarchist groups running around Spain are decimated. Many within Unión Monárquica Nacional have protested Sanjurjo’s ideas, claiming that democracy was the reason for Spain’s downfall, but the general’s status as the war hero of Rif war and the preserver of the monarchy makes his authority nigh absolute within Spain. Those republicans who have remained in Spain despite the recent events are sceptical, though some have noted that it was Accion Popular, not the general himself, who betrayed the 1936 promises of a return to democratic rule. Still, many view this as mostly a signal of slight thawing in the regime, not a promise the Caudillo of Spain is likely to keep. Some merely expect that Sanjurjo will announce his resignation and give up power to another military man to pass on the duty of possibly restoring elections, though this is as much of a possibility as the restoration of democracy given that the general’s inner thoughts are not exactly open to the public"

However, among the most prominent members of the Spanish republicans to stay in Spain was Alejandro Lerroux, the caudillo of Partido Radical Republicano and the boss of Catalonia. This was not merely through his personal perseverance and interest in staying in Spain, for his friendship with general Sanjurjo, forged already in 1905 while the two men were frequenting the same nightlife events while living in Madrid and Barcelona. Lerroux is believed to have been one of the few Spanish republicans to be aware of the upcoming Sanjurjada coup through this connection, and initially it seemed that Sanjurjo may have planned to include him in the civilian government after stepping down, but the leadership of Accion Popular made it clear that they would not collaborate with a known anti-clerical such as Lerroux. \n\nHowever, the general and Lerroux seem to have remained relatively close, and during the period of unrest following the return to authoritarian rule, it was even suggested that one of the reasons Catalan anarchists did not manage to create a more effective network to resist the new government was thanks to the efforts of Lerroux and his political machine, destroying the anarchist rebellion from inside the infamous street of Paralelo where these terrorists frequented entertainment venues controlled by Lerroux and his informants. Whether this is true or not is shrouded in doubt, but for the time being, Lerroux and his goons in Catalonia remain the one bastion of true republicanism within Spain, protected not only through their extensive network of allies, vassals and informants, but also because of the good graces of the general leading Spain."

sprd.273.d:0 "As general Sanjurjo is increasingly more needed in the administration of the new Spanish state, he has little time to devote to his post as the leader of the Spanish Guardia Civil,  a rural police meant to keep peace in the countryside. As such, issues have begun to arise where the high command of this arm of national defence is not available even during crucial decisions, and this has significantly impacted the force’s effectiveness. Due to his new role as the Caudillo of Spain, many have suggested that Sanjurjo steps down from his post as the head of Guardia Civil and installs a new leader for the group. Most likely successor is considered to be general Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer, capable leader of the Carabineros and a hero of the Rif War, though other options are also available as Cabanellas is known to hold republican sympathies and often associates with liberal and moderate conservative groups opposed to our current regime. Another option would be the long-serving general of Guardia Civil,  Federico Santiago Iglesias, who despite his advanced age could be placed at the head of the organization due to his experience and connections. Another alternative is also, coincidentally, another Sanjurjo, José Sanjurjo y Rodríguez de Arias. Having served in the Guardia Civil for quite some time, he is known for being apolitical and efficient leader of the organization, serving both the republic and the monarchy faithfully for decades"

sprd.274.d:0 "Despite the doubts of republicans and moderate supporters of the monarchy alike, it would appear that General Sanjurjo has stayed true to his word, and the kingdom has begun the long and arduous process of returning to democratic rule. Sanjurjo, burdened by years of steering Spain away from chaos, has announced that he will step down, and the ruling party is expected to drop out of elections due to a lack of interest in democratic processes. Those within UMN who support the return of democracy have largely gone to join the new parties stepping in to fill the void.\n\nLeading the left-most wing of the new electoral system is the behemoth of republicanism left in Spain, Alejandro Lerroux, and his Partido Radical. Known for anti-Catalanism, highly populist rhetoric and moderate liberal politics mixed in with Lerroux’s own political machine infamous for its excessive corruption, PR has become the leading liberal party in new Spain, allowed to exist solely because of Lerroux’s strength as a balancing factor in Catalonia and his warm relations with former dictator Sanjurjo. Representing a more monarchist liberal approach is Partido Provincial Agrario, first formed during Republican years and now re-emerging as a splinter of the defunct Partido Agrario Español. Tired of the dictatorship, its leader José María Cid Ruiz-Zorrilla managed to convince PAE’s leader José Martínez de Velasco to unite the remaining agrarians under one banner, and now they seek an agrarian, socially conservative yet economically liberal Kingdom.\n\nThey are opposed by the party of caciques, Partido Liberal-Fusionista, ruled by the venerable oligarch Count of Romanones, with the party mixing a degree of liberal ideas with a near-invincible political machine stretching all across Spain, intended to keep their opponents out of politics in any way possible. Finally, the old king Alfonso’s favourites in Accion Popular, humbled by years under Sanjurjo’s rule, have returned to contest their opponents in elections, seeking to bring Christian democracy to Spain with an iron fist. Finally, the unexpected arrival of Partido Laborista, under Eduard Aunós Perez, claims to bring peace to Spain through a program of corporatist principles mixed with a society restructured along professions and guilds similar to those seen during medieval times, all within a singular Catholic vision, having convinced many within UMN to join their ranks."

While terrorist violence has been truly rooted out from our midst, the protests continue, and the government cannot simply crush them under heel without fears of further radicalization and the creation of martyrs for the anti-establishment forces.\n\nThe moderates within Accion Popular, led by Luis Lucia Lucia and Manuel Giménez Fernandez, have called for a return to democratic form of governance under a constitutional monarchy with a large degree of political power to placate the far-right parties. These dissidents within the largest opposition party have gathered support from the only real remaining republican force in Spain, the radicals of Alejandro Lerroux, who have increased pressure on Sanjurjo’s government as well. The calls for Sanjurjo to honour his promise of a return to democracy made so many years ago are growing stronger, but the question remains, will the Caudillo of Spain honour his promise and finally seek a retirement from his long tenure as the helmsman of Spain?"

sprd.276.d:0 "The regionalist dilemma is hardly one that can be fixed with a singular policy, as the recent instability and uprisings demonstrated that the Catalans, Basques and Galicians have their fair share of rotten eggs among the population, seeking to break the half a millenia old unity of Spain in their delusions of independence and sovereignty. However, Eduardo Aunós, one of the key ideologues of the new Unión Monárquica Nacional, has proposed a way to at least party address the issue, which he calls Leridanismo, named after his home town of Lleida. Lleida, a city in Catalonia, has always been an unique part of the region between Catalonia and Aragon, adopting an identity fully of its own from those of the two, much larger and distinct regions. The local groups sympathetic to UMN’s cause have formed Caliu Ilerdenc, a cultural club discussing gastronomy, local folklore and literature.\n\nThe club boasts prominent members from all across the Catalan right-wing social sphere, such as Víctor Hellín Sol and Ramon Anery, uniting elitists of Pena Blanca with the conservative Catalans of Lliga Regionalista. In their view, Lleida is superior to the Catalan culture and a micro-culture in itself, promoting some elements of Catalan society and mixing them with unique Lleida customs in a way that does not lead to the separatist tendencies of the more Catalan supremacist movements. It is paired with the Institut d'Estudis Ilerdencs, an academic organization aimed at preserving and teaching the history of Lleida and developing its cultural peculiarities separate from the developments in Catalonia.\n\nMany may view Leridanismo as simply a small regional peculiarity, but given that all regions of Spain have some degree of sympathizers to the Madrid regime, and should these similar sub-regional organizations be promoted further, it could help break the hold of nationalist parties such as Partido Nacionalista Vasca, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya and Partido Galeguista, as these elite clubs would be the only real way to influence developments in the region. If every region develops its own version of Lleida, it’ll fragment the nationalist movements into smaller, isolationist groups of very local forums, too weak to truly resist the Madrid government. This alone will not save Spain from the nationalist hounds, but it will possibly help the matter slightly "

sprd.277.d:0 "Dr. Albiñana has long been a fierce rhetorician of the Spanish right, but this has hardly earned him many allies. Without the king’s favour, his movement would likely have ended up in the dustbin of history as the greatest contribution PNE has given to the struggle of reaction in Spain has been through its paramilitary Legionaries. However, now that Albiñana has become the leader of Spain alongside young king Jaime, many former rivals and opponents of this beacon of reaction have crawled back to him, words dripping with honey as they attempt to negotiate better positions for themselves. The conservative landholders of Partido Agrario have been integrated into the fold of PNE, having long served as allies to Albiñana given their similar support for the defense of Spain’s eternal institutions, love for the rural countryside and of course, the shared backing of large landholders.\n\nHowever, despite the tiny size of PNE, there have been a degree of factionalism within the party, as the Legionarist wing of the party is split between those who support the more radical direction of the party’s other founder Manuel Delgado Barreto, and those who support the more traditionalist direction of Albiñana. These divisions are mostly simply differences of opinion, but they could lead to further diversions in the party’s direction should either side convince the other. The more pressing matters are the party’s possibilities of integrating other monarchist forces in Spain.\n\nAlbiñana and Delgado have ruled out the integration of Accion Popular into the ranks, as there is quite a bit of bad blood between the two parties, with PNE seeing AP as little more than a group of soft bourgeois legalists and accidentalist opportunists, while AP sees Albiñana and his goons as dangerous loose cannons best ignored. Similarly, Albiñana’s populist approach clashes with the elitism and aristocracy of Renovación Española, who they view as inefficient nobles too snobby to get their hands dirty in the real world politics of PNE. However, Albiñana has been somewhat open to working with the Maurists of RE, viewing them as more pure in monarchism than most of RE, and he is also known for supporting an unification with the Carlists due to shared ideological roots. However, for the doctor’s party to grow, negotiations must be held between all these groups to determine whether there is interest for a partnership, and then the party must determine the direction of its ideological basis."

In many ways, Delgado has always been the firebrand of the movement, as his key goal has for decades been to mobilize a violent and strong force against syndicalists, in similar vein to the Legionaries of PNE. Heavily inspired by the Italian Arditi and the post-Weltkrieg organization of Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, Delgado dreamed of creating Legion Nacional, reinforced by Maurists, members of the defunct citizen militia Unión Ciudadana and the veterans of the Rif War, who would overpower the anarchists through sheer devotion and skill. \n\nDelgado’s newspaper La Nación has long been a promoter of Italian-style Legionarism in Spain, viewing local strains of Legionarism, even the one created by his allies in PNE, as inherently too simplistic and unambitious, too heavily tied to the local traditions and especially too close to Carlism. However, Delgado has so far been unable to gather much support to his ideas, but depending the party trajectory of PNE, his ideas could win favour among the ever-restless Legionaries of Albiñana, who fear that with the ascension of their leader to the leadership of entire Spain, the movement will forget its roots and dwindle down to become yet another establishment party.

sprd.279.d:0 "The Maurists are a small group within Renovación Española, following the leadership of former party leader Antonio Goicoechea, who was removed from power by the upstart José Calvo Sotelo following his return to Spain and surge in popularity. Whereas Calvo Sotelo fell in with the French monarchist theorist Charles Maurras, and started supporting his ideology over perfectly good and viable Spanish traditionalist ideas, Goicoechea retained the traditionalist outlook of the most right-flank of Antonio Maura’s successors. With his support dwindling by the day, and the party he helped found diverting further and further from the ideals of Maura into something completely unrecognizable, Goicoechea has decided to jump ship and join Partido Nacionalista, hoping that the new rulers of Spain to be open to his ideologies more than Calvo Sotelo.\n\nMuch to his surprise, PNE’s leadership had already discussed opening a rift within RE by exploiting the disgruntled Maurists, and while the number of defectors from Calvo Sotelo’s organization was by no means large, it was nonetheless enough to cause a crisis of identity within RE, pending much larger reform of the movement. With perhaps the most prominent Maurist left in Spain now supporting PNE, it’s possible that others from Acción Española and Acción Popular will follow suit, leaving their dying parties to join the only organization with the will and virility to truly regenerate the ailing kingdom. Given king Jaime’s inherent bias towards traditionalism, his wholesale support of the PNE’s expansion has weighed heavily in the favour of these defections, and it will make continued resistance of other parties towards PNE much harder to organize."

sprd.280.d:0 "With the Maurists and Carlists now bending the knee to Dr. Albiñana, the new Partido Nacionalista has gathered in the former Cortes building in Madrid to discuss the future of the party. The Carlists, once more under the united banner of Spain’s monarchists, have eyed the king present with a degree of suspicion, given the century-old hatred between the two dynastic branches, but for now things appear to remain civil. However, the arrival of Manuel Delgado Barreto to the scene has caused a degree of unrest within the crowd, as the ideas of Delgado are quite a bit more radical than those of the Maurists and Carlists.\n\nEach faction within the new PNE seeks to sway the party leader towards their perceived future, but it is not a given that Albiñana would simply consolidate power around his own clique of Legionaries and ignore the calls for change from the other factions. The Maurists have proposed a traditionalist, protectionist and somewhat urban elitist model, ensuring support from many of Spain’s nobles and industrialists. The Carlists support mobilizing the peasantry and loyal minority regions such as Navarra, Aragon and Andalusia to our cause, decentralizing the regime to a great extent to ensure that the rights of local people are not crushed under the heel of a tyrannical Madrid overlord.\n\nThis would be a change from the traditional stance of PNE, which has always defended the political unity of the Fatherland, but with Spain’s treacherous separatists mostly crushed and anarchists weakened considerably, the new regime can probably loosen this particular tenet of their ideology and turn towards a more Carlist-view on autonomous governance. Finally, the smallest faction by far being Delgado’s legionaries, has promised to fully transform Spain into a highly militarized, ultranationalist state, that will hound all enemies of the monarchist order to the ends of the Earth and promote a corporate state eliminating class conflict completely. Supported mainly by the Spanish Foreign Legion, hardliners such as Onésimo Redondo and Juan de Ansaldo and Hispanist such as Ramiro de Maetzu, their ability to mobilize veterans of the Rif Wars could prove useful in coming conflicts with our internal and external enemies. In the end, the decision lays on Albiñana himself"

Hardly anyone saw these ruffians attempting to move to parliamentary politics, but Albiñana has announced his bid to run in the upcoming elections on a platform of bringing back a sense of pride to Spain and putting to sword those who would slander the great nation. Focusing mainly on rural farmers and Catholic workers, PNE seeks to offer an alternative to the radical anti-democratic monarchists of Renovacion Espanola and the more moderate king’s favourites in Accion Popular. Few in Spain expect PNE to be able to moderate its course, and even fewer expect them to win in the elections, but the political landscape of Spain has certainly shifted into an interesting direction."

sprd.285.d:0 "One of the most peculiar, and prestigious, vessels in the Spanish navy is the aircraft, airship and autogyro carrier Dédalo. Originally a German merchant vessel Neuenfels, it was given to Spain as compensation for the numerous Spanish vessels sunk by German U-Boats during the Weltkrieg, and while it was originally thought to simply retain the role of a merchant vessel, the Aeronáutica Naval, a new branch of the Spanish navy, had other ideas. Dédalo was converted to its new role as a carrier in the Talleres Nuevo Vulcano naval yard in Barcelona, and Wenceslao Benítez Inglott became the captain of the vessel thereafter. The carrier would first see action in the landing at Alhucemas, where its Italian-made AP balloons and SCA dirigibles provided reconnaissance, and the complement of different naval aircrafts, most notably Felixstowe F.3, Macchi M.18 and Supermarine Scarab flying boats. It was not a true carrier in the sense that the planes would take off from its deck, but instead a crane would lower these flying boats to the water and they would take off from there.\n\nThe ship could carry twelve folded aircrafts on its deck, and twenty stowed to a hangar below deck, though combat operation strength varied greatly, especially after British and Italian parts became harder to source and aircraft were cannibalized for parts. After autogyros, such as the creations of Juan de Cierva, became more and more popular in Spain, Cierva was offered a possibility to attempt a landing on Dédalo, something the aviator easily achieved, and there has been plans to convert the aging warship to a full autogyro carrier to provide aerial spotting and light combat support, though as helicopters are becoming more common as well, such as the possible upcoming Cierva War Horse, some hope that Dédalo will extend its life as a helicopter carrier, continuing its streak of naval and aviation firsts. However, the sad truth of the matter is that the days of Dédalo are slowly coming to a close, and a scrapping may await this veteran of the seas unless comprehensive refurbishing is undertaken."

sprd.286.d:0 "The Rif War and especially the Disaster at Annual, where thousands of badly-trained, equipped and led metropolitan troops were slaughtered en masse by the Rif rebels of Abd el Krim, are a dark stain upon the military honour of Spain. And yet, elements of that war would go on to live in annals of history as great successes and pioneering events, and perhaps no other battle is as deserving of being lauded as an amazing success of said conflict than the landing at Alhucemas. Alhucemas was the home of Kabilas, Abd el Krim’s home tribe, and it had been an unruly region for decades, with first plans for a landing dating back more than a decade ago. Spanish forces had tried to march into Alhucemas by land, but the difficulty of maintaining supply in the difficult terrain of the Rif made such attacks into utter failures. After general Primo de Rivera came to power through a coup, he sought to cut the head of Rifian resistance by crushing Kabila tribe through a decisive landing, and after Abd el Krim foolishly picked a fight with the French nationalists in Algiers, the combined Spanish-French military might was diverted to fully decimate the young Republic.\n\nThe landing was mainly a Spanish affair, involving over ten thousand soldiers sent from Melilla and Ceuta, made up of elite units such as the Spanish Legion under Francisco Franco, indigenous troops from the Regulares and protectorate forces, and battle-hardened troops from many skirmishes against Rifian rebels, led primarily by José Sanjurjo. The landing would become the first large-scale amphibious attack in history, and its nature as a multi-branch, multinational operation utilizing the massive guns of Alfonso XIII battleship, the aircraft and airship carrier Dédalo, the seaplanes of the French army and the army troops of Spain, making multiple firsts in the history of Spanish, and even international, military matters. Despite fortifications and mining efforts of the Rif rebels, the landing was a success, and the new weapons used in the operation such as tanks and aircraft, made the battle an easy victory for the Spanish forces. \n\nToday, we call on the spirit of Alhucemas as we reform the Spanish Marines, which were shut down in 1930 as they were a casualty amid military stagnation and political instability, as well as the belief that warfare had gone past amphibious landings. However, many of the great powers of the world, be it the British, the Communards, the Japanese, and so on, have shown us the fact that we must move past the spectre of Gallipoli which scared so many away from this type of warfare to show we are ready for the upcoming war, and that Alhucemas shall not be the exception, but the norm for Spanish amphibious warfare excellence."

As per this agreement, the ships designed by the company Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval have always been made on the basis of British designs, and the British have supplied the Ferrol yards with ample technical and material knowledge. A small contingent of British engineers and military personnel has lived in Ferrol since the start of the agreement, but after the fall of Britain to the syndicalists, these men and women were left bereft of a cause, some deciding to return to the Unionist side, others joining their former rulers in Canada.\n\nSome, however, remained, and while the wealth of Vickers-Armstrong and John Brown company is nowhere the levels it once maintained, they have been more than able to hold onto their stake of the company. However, as years roll by, the British empire turns more and more inwards, dedicating its resources to the fledgling industries of the former colonies and dominions, it is evidently clear that the British are moving towards empire-wide restructuring. Some within the government, especially those connected to SECN and naval security, have raised concerns that this will lead to the British pulling out their assets from Ferrol to instead focus on what is likely to be an attempt at reclamation of the Home Isles.\n\nWhile the garrison at Ferrol has not indicated any such intentions of leaving, the ministry of naval affairs has suggested that as a precaution, the deal is cut, the stakes of British companies forcibly seized, with compensation, and possibly sold to the Germans instead, to ensure steady flow of technological and material experience from the Kaiserreich. Many view this as a drastic and costly move, but there are upsides other than simple security. The German navy has rapidly grown since the Weltkrieg, and the fresh ideas they could bring our navy are worth the risk of upsetting the British.

Spain observed these collapses with fear, and that fear manifested most thoroughly in the Red Scare of 1920. But in terms of actual military action taken to avoid a possible Communard invasion or revolution, most action taken by the high command focused on the Pyrenean mountains. The German takeover of Malta and Crete was expected to tip the balance of naval dominance handily to anti-syndicalist forces, but as war clouds once again emerge over the European nations, many Spanish naval officers are increasingly worried that the Mediterranean will become a battlefield, and the islands of the Balearics alongside the sea at large.\n\nAs such, an ambitious new program has been started to fully prepare these islands for a possible attack, with the entrances to Las Palmas harbour fortified and reinforced with heavy naval artillery. This renovation is modelled after the La Parajola battery in Cartagena, with some inspiration also taken from the British fortresses seized in Gibraltar. As in La Parajola, the new fortifications have been armed with Reinosa-forged copies of the Vickers-Armstrong 152 millimetre guns, and it is hoped that they can drive back any cruisers or destroyers from Communard fleets, or, should our relations with the French nationalists sour, from them as well. Another program of installing similar batteries to the island of Menorca is also planned, as many within the military high command fear the loyalty of Catalans in the island of Mallorca to be suspicious at best.

While the cursed Bolivar and his cronies would sever the connection Spain had to its colonies, finally ending this massive global trade empire, the link between Spanish and their former colonial subjects would slowly return, healing over centuries of shared cultural heritage, history and shared hatred for the Americans seeking to dominate everything south of them. Now that Spain has once more returned to world politics after such a long period of licking its wounds, the time has come to set sail once more, to release the treasure fleet of Spanish merchants from Compañía Transatlántica Española and Compañía Española de Tabacos de Filipinas as well as smaller enterprises such as the fleet of the Sota family.\n\nThese mighty ships will ensure that our connections to the Latin American nations may never again be cut, and while in the past we came as conquerors, today Spanish fleets bring prosperity, fraternity and above all else, security to that corner of the world that so desperately needs these things. Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval, the national naval construction company, has agreed to dedicate some of their production towards the creation of large naval cruisers, intended to cross the stormy Atlantic waters swiftly and safely, protected by the Churruca, Alava and Cervera-class warships of the Spanish navy. The republican era department of naval trade, Marina Mercante, Navegación e Industrias Marítimas, will continue to operate as the central body overseeing this trade, and already deals have been made with local companies in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay to better facilitate the transfer of goods.

Nowhere is this more clear today than in the continued retaining of a bayonet attack as a vital cornerstone of Spanish military strategy. The old guard believes that the battle is nothing more than a struggle of two competitive spirits, where men will test their mettle against the opposition, and this culminates in a hand-to-hand clash between two armies at close quarters. Technology is secondary to the soldier’s primary instict to see his bayonet driven to the heart of his enemy.\n\nWhile the Weltkrieg demonstrated that wars can stagnate into horrible stalemates where simple assaults may not bring the desired result despite seemingly never-ending casualties, this was mostly born out of the lack of a desire to see the war to the end displayed by the two sides of the war, as seen by the Spanish high command. As Brigadier Burguete put it, these forces had become so relied on their machines and technologies, burdening the poor grunts with a thousand different knicknacks of little actual use outside of specific circumstances, that the true victor of battles, the cold sharp steel at the end of a rifleman’s weapon, had become forgotten and buried under all the needless rubbish.

This must be applied in Spain as well, as while France may have been able to arm and supply its grand armies technically, Spain does not have the luxury of such wasteful use of the scant resources present to us, especially after so many economic hardships our nation has had to endure.\n\nThe Rif War presented without a doubt that mass use of conscripts can only lead to tragedy, as seen with the Disaster at Annual, where the barbarians of Abd el Krim ruthlessly slaughtered metropolitan troops. It is true that we must adopt some degree of new weaponry, be they machine guns, chemical weapons or anti-tank armaments, but unlike some theorists claim, these should not become the main focus of the reborn Spanish army. Instead, we must focus on mobility above all else, as the new and shiny weapons would only slow down our units. Instead, where new weapon types are needed, they will be handled by specialist units designated for the transportation and use of these armaments. Much more focus must be placed on the drilling and morale training of our troops, so that they may smash apart their soft and technology-reliant opponents in a honest man-to-man fight.\n\nSpecial units such as the Regulares, mountaineers and the Spanish Legion must also be utilized to the best of their capabilities, as they possess even greater experience in mobile warfare in the tough conditions of Spain, though the army itself must be transformed into a far more professional force. The art of war and maneuvre warfare must be emphasized above all else, for Spain’s sons to succeed and avoid the pitfalls the French fell into during their defence against Germans, their conscript army turning them into an inherently defensive unit. We must learn from their experience but without discarding the centuries of experience Spanish soldiers have gained over the years."

However, while this tragedy caused our northern border to become a far more active place of military developments, it did help Spain’s domestic industry kickstart many of its programs. Right before the collapse of the French Republic, Spanish artillery industry had managed to negotiate a deal to produce one of the most up-to-date French heavy guns, the Canon Court de 105 M modèle 1919 Schneider, a powerful and relatively nimble gun for its size, mainly intended for mountaineer usage. The artillery factory of Reinosa and the Royal Artillery Factory of Sevilla have been producing the gun for nearly two decades now, unburdened by licensing costs as the French nationalists have more pressing matters to see to and the Communards hardly interact with the Spanish state.\n\nSome Spanish models have even been sold to nations such as Serbia and Finland, who equally appreciate the mobility and compact size of the gun. However, it is clear that age is creeping on the venerable weapon, and its rate of fire, power and previously good mobility are starting to become obsolete in the grand scheme of military evolution. As such, the Reinosa factory has shifted production to a German field gun produced under license, as Spain has a long tradition of alternating between Schneider and Krupp designs.\n\nSome Schneiders shall remain in active use amongst Spain’s Pyrenean units, but the questions has been raised on what to do with the remaining guns. Obvious solution would be to keep the guns in reserve in case the Communards or some other force get any ideas of invading Spain, but some generals have offered a more proactive role for these weapons. Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco has suggested utilizing the guns as coastal batteries to protect the Bay of Biscay from possible French or British landing attempts, while general José Riquelme y López-Bago, one of the chief officers serving in Catalonia, has instead suggested using the guns to fortify the Pyrenean mountain sides in case the Communards attempt to cross the mountains as back during the prelude to Peninsular Wars."

sprd.293.t:0 "The Trueta Procedure"
sprd.293.d:0 "The military may be heavily interested in modern weapons, innovative battle tactics and new ways of waging war, but the reality of current battlefield is that no matter how shiny and effective new guns, tanks and planes are developed, there is always the need to have boots on to support them. As such, given the rather traditionalist slant of the military’s chosen doctrine, many more progressive-minded military men have looked into minimizing casualties from the mass warfare promoted by the upper echelons of the army. This has allowed the ideas of surgeon Josep Trueta to be put into action treating our wounded. Trueta is known for his long career as a surgeon and insurance company doctor, working for the firm Caja de Previsión y Sorocco in the treatment of forty thousand accident victims a day.\n\nHowever, while working for the company, Trueta continued his medical research and developed the so called Trueta method in 1934. The procedure was meant to improve the chances of avoiding infections from bone fractures, but to many medical professionals of the time, it was way too risky to be utilized outside of highly controllable and sanitized conditions. Trueta persisted, however, and after becoming the Surgeon Director at Hospital de Sant Pau in 1935, he would do a limited number of demonstrations that wooed many within the military staff. Early field trials for treating accident-related fractures have shown a near ninety percent drop in infections derived from bone fractures while utilizing the Trueta method, and the battlefield surgeons of Spain have promoted its more widespread adoption. However, many still consider the procedure too risky for wartime use, and even more importantly, the fact that Trueta is a Catalan nationalist turns many away from the procedure. Still, Trueta’s expertise as a surgeon cannot be understated, especially given that he has written nearly hundred scientific articles related to medicine alongside a handful of books, and other militaries such as the Canadian army have shown a degree of interest towards this new method through the Catalan exile community’s correspondence with Trueta."

Count of Romanones and his supporters may hold near absolute power in Spain due to the king’s support, but this may not always be the case, especially given the Count’s somewhat liberal tendencies and the absolute hatred that many within the extreme right have for caciques.\n\nAs such, some have noted that it could perhaps be prudent to restore the so called El Turno Pacífico, with us allying the conservatives more pliable to our ideas, such as the remaining Maurists led by Antonio Goicoechea, the Agrarians of José Martínez de Velasco and couple returning republicans such as Miguel Maura and Niceto Alcala-Zamora. If the conservatives of Spain have a platform through which to express their ideas and occasionally rule in elections, the situation may not bubble over to dangerous levels as it did in early 1930s and again in 1936. The populists and far-right lunatics, as well as their rivals on the left and among the republicans, are the reason Spain found itself in such a sorry state, but if we were to restore a system of two rational parties alternating their rule, Spain could finally find the peace it had during the Restoration era under such magnificent men as Antonio Cánovas del Castillo.\n\nWe have opened dialogue with leading Maurists to possibly create a new Partido Maurista that would continue the spirit of the Conservative Party and ally us in the pursuit of Spain’s stability, but there are those within Partido Fusionista who think that this is a mistake and we should instead retain our grip on power as only the party most versatile among Spain’s right can best dictate the policies going forward."

The Carlist-Alfonsists split has led Spain to such immense fraternal violence that only the sordid affairs against the anarchists and socialists can rival the scale of hatred, but now that José María Albiñana has finally taken his God-ordained spot as the leader of Spain and embarked on  a crusade to bring social rule of Jesus Christ to Spain, there can be no place for such divisions in Spain. Albiñana and his Partido Nacionalista Español have dedicated much of their entire existence in bridging the two camps of Spanish monarchist traditionalists, and out of all the forces in Spain, they have had perhaps the greatest success in it.\n\nDuring a particularly bleak episode in the history of the party, when it was quite close to a full-blown collapse, the doctor recommended that his followers join the Traditionalist Communion in the case that PNE would no longer exist. Thankfully, PNE managed to pull through these dire straits, and his party has gone from rags to riches, and now, their close ideological ties to the Carlists have made negotiations in Burgos rather fruitful. The matter is further helped by the fact that Albiñana was a member of the Burgos administration during the tumultuous years between 1932 and 1936, and his program of grassroots activism and engagement with locals based on their daily needs, improving their lives through infrastructure projects, installation of telephone lines, performing legal work for local water companies and funneling investment into the region through deals with investors and negotiations for government subsidies.\n\nBurgos has long been one of the central strongholds of Carlism, alongside Pamplona and certain Andalusian towns, and thus the doctor’s good work was noticed. This reputation has allowed the negotiations to pass smoothly, and it appears that the beaten and battered remnants of the Traditionalist Communion, currently led by the more moderate Marcelino Oreja Elosegui, are now fully seeking integration into the wide front led by Partido Nacionalista. The schism between Spain’s monarchists may finally be resolved, as Albiñana always dreamt of."

As such, they have suggested that another party takes the leadership and implements the policy supported by their allies, with a possible change in leadership in due time.

The parties involved are the rare Castilian regionalists and moderate Christian agrarians of Unión Castellana Agraria, led by the tireless agrarian conservatives Ricardo Cortés Villasana and Juan Díaz Caneja, the paternalistic conservative agrarians of Acción Agraria Riojana led by Tomás Ortiz de Solórzano y Ortiz de la Puente, the liberal agrarians of Partido Provincial Agrario of José María Cid Ruiz-Zorrilla and the Christian democrat splinter party from Accion Popular, Derecha Regional Agrario, led by Luis Lucia Lucia. \n\nNone of these parties hold the nation-wide support of Partido Agrario, but their influence on regional level is nothing to be scoffed at, with UCA prominent in Castile, La Mancha and Asturias, PPA prominent in the province of Zamora and surrounding areas, AAR holding a considerable sway in Cantabria, Navarra and La Rioja, and DRA prolific in the regions of Valencia, Murcia and Catalonia. These regionalists are hardly as treacherous as those within the ranks of Basque, Catalan and Galician separatists, but they will require us to make concessions to regional self-governance, something PAE is not necessarily opposed to as long as it curtails the more separatist elements within Spanish society. In exchange to these compromises from the side of PAE, the regional parties are in turn expected to fall into a wider confederation of agrarian parties within Spain, the so called Agrarian Majority, to ensure that no rival parties or organizations can ever threaten the influence of PAE in Spain.\n\nThe regional groups will be nominally independent, but their larger political platform besides regional matters will be made in Madrid within the wider council of agrarians, and the parties are expected to support PAE in wider national matter such as economic organization, foreign policy and political reforms. With the help of these regional groups, the moderate agrarians of Spain may finally break the hold of both agrarian syndicalists and radical firebrands such as Albiñana’s Partido Nacionalista and Accion Popular’s local groups, who seek only to exploit the local peasants and smallholders to gain political capital for their non-rural platforms"

sprd.306.d:0 "As Partido Fusionista has now consolidated itself as the sole administrator of the Spanish kingdom and the right hand of King Juan, the leadership, especially Count of Romanones, has found it rather difficult to govern certain areas. Given the rather liberal nature of the Count and his supporters, even with the new authoritarian approach they have adopted, the remnants of the old regime tend to attempt sabotage, subterfuge and full-blown insubordination in areas where the Count’s caciquists and genuine supporters hold little sway. Reactionaries from Renovación Española and Partido Nacionalista Español are always aching to hamper our rule, especially as they know the Count’s stance on the Catholic church, and thus it has been rather difficult to rule Spain to the full extent of PF’s new powers.\n\nHowever, despite the widespread drives to push Republicans into exile or prison, there are still a great deal of these men within our nation, and while their status is hardly better than that of a pariah, they can still benefit our reign greatly. Radicals such as those of Alejandro Lerroux and Diego Martinez-Barrio love the church even less than we do, and while they may view the good Count and his followers as little more than reactionaries masquerading as liberals, they will likely take any chance they can get to participate in the reforming of a new Spain.\n\nHowever, given that Partido Fusionista situation is rather shaky already, taking the liberals and republicans abroad may lead to the full-scale revolt of reactionaries, even if PF has the king’s blessing for the time being. As such, some suggest simply bolstering our ranks by recruiting rank-and-file republicans in PF, and then converting them to a monarchist mindset, especially among those republicans that are still salvageable. This would see us integrate groups such as Niceto Alcala-Zamora’s Derecha Liberal Republicana and Partido del Centro Democrático of Manuel Portela Valladares, who are noted for their pragmatism in matters such as these. This would likely not solve all our regional issues, but would at least temporarily give us better means at contesting the traditionalists, integralists and other rabble who seek to keep Spain in the middle ages for good."

The new constitution will protect the rights to religion and conscience, and will ensure that the rights of association, union membership and property are not trampled on by any governors of civil law. Wide-scale amnesty will be given to republicans as well, as the government does not want to remove partisanship from society fully, simply ensure that the monarchist order is not toppled by syndicalist rabble. As such, while PAE is committed to the rights of individuals, they are also committed to ensuring that authority is provided fully in society, so that it does not descend to anarchy.\n\nThe role of government is to ensure that the ideas of citizens do not contradict the wellbeing of the Spanish society, and thus in certain circumstances the government will be given the necessary precautions to freeze parts of the rights of Spanish people to ensure social cohesion, most notably in the forcible disbanding of parties that actively call for treacherous and revolutionary actions, such as PSOE and in more minor roles, BOC. Other parties, especially the more republican remnants of Union Republicana and Izquierda Republicana, have called this a blatant support of the PAE’s landowner backers, as the new amendment is worded in a way that gives the government ability to intervene in rural land issues directly in the name of ‘defence of public order’.\n\nGiven the weak situation of these republican forces, however, there is hardly much they can do to oppose the new constitution. To ensure public order and organic cooperation into society, the Cortes will be also reformed to become a bicameral institution, with the new second chamber made up of societal organizations, such as employer’s organizations, unions and other groups with vested interests in governance. The most radical change to the Constitution would be the situation of Hispanic citizens and the planned Spanishization of Latin American nationals should they set a foot on Spanish shores, as well as the invitation of Latin American representatives to the Spanish Cortes, but for the time being, these plans are pushed for a later date to ensure that the new planned constitution can be fully finalized on Spanish domestic matters.

Organizations such as Confederacion de Obreros Catolicos de Levante, a co-operative groups of tenant farmers, seasonal labourers and peasants in the Levantine regions of Iberia, has been practically left astray and integrating it into the wider PAE network would not only boost our numbers, but also help paint a picture of PAE that is far less elitist than previously may have been apparent, given that many of the members of COCL are lower class agrarians yet just as pious as those of PAE’s middle- and upper class members. Similarly, the employer’s organization of Confederación Española Patronal Agraria has collaborated with PAE in the past to ensure that the prices of grain remain competitive but not overtly burdening to the light wallets of the poor landholders. Integrating CEPA into PAE would on the other hand allow us to widen our network of allies all across Spain, and the two different organizations uniting differing socio-economical bases in Spain could work within the party of PAE to ensure that any conflicts of interests are resolved without much public outrage and needless bickering, facilitated further by enforcers of PAE working on behalf of the government. Such an integration of small organizations will hardly be an easy one, especially given that much of PAE’s influence has typically distributed around the territories of Castile and Leon, but the benefits are too lucrative to pass.

sprd.310.t:0 "Calvo Sotelo’s Conquest of State"
sprd.310.d:0 "Spanish monarchism has, since time immemorial, been mostly a force of tradition, hierarchy and little actual change. The move from mercantilism to capitalism in Spain was a slow and sluggish affair, and among the conservatives, it was still a strong point of contention as many viewed it as inherently liberal and exploitative of the Catholic workers, at least in the form of a laissez-faire capitalism. However, the Spanish monarchists have hardly detached themselves from capitalism, and many Spanish nobles are also important industrialists, corporation owners and venture capitalists even if they hold disdain for non-noble capitalists such as Juan March, who earned his enormous fortune through smuggling and other scrupulous avenues. However, there has always been a push among Spanish monarchists and conservatives to reform capitalism to better fit the needs of Spain, and with the rise of Renovación Española to the leadership of Spain, premier Calvo Sotelo has announced his plan to do just that.\n\nHis new view is a capitalism of savings, a way to defeat the crisis of capitalism through an authoritarian form, introducing command economy, hints of corporatism through the reorganization of labour alongside these ideals, and the introduction of strong government control unto the economy to ensure that neither the employers nor employees overstep from their positions. Calvo Sotelo claims that capitalism is in a crisis that is not terminal but cyclical, and these new measures will turn it into a more humane model that can stand the test of time. Gone will be the inefficient and wasteful ideas of speculative and financial capitalism, replaced by truly authoritarian capitalism for a Spain of new age.\n\nThis new form of capitalism must not be the static model of modern financial capitalism, where the ownership class will simply settle for being a rentier, but a dynamic force in constant motion, producing creations through the movement of forces within the capitalist class. This will be achieved through the creation and application of surplus created by the economy, into the economy, to ensure that stagnation or labour conflicts do not arise. The workers will get their fair share, while the capitalist class will be prodded into action to ensure that they do not become like dragons hoarding their wealth in a cave. This is Calvo Sotelo’s new vision of capitalism, aimed at avoiding the pitfalls of blaming either workers or upper class owners for the ailments of society as so many corporatists, syndicalists and other forms of ideologies often claim, and through this reform to the entire institution of economy, Calvo Sotelo aims to conquer the state and its many differing branches, ending the crisis of capitalism and the spawns of syndicalism once and for all."

But now, thanks to the swift gauntlet of justice wielded by AE and its leader Ramiro de Maetzu, alongside their allies in the Spanish army and the Guerillas de España of Juan de Ansaldo, a purification of Spanish blood may once again start. A new crusade, harking back to the glory days of the Reconquista.\n\nThe new king and his fierce Hispanic ideologue shall divert the loyal sons of Spain to hound the forces of anti-Spain where ever they will try to hole up into, from the tallest peaks to the Pyrenees to the open plains of Andalusia, enemies of the monarchy and church shall never know peace. Rebellious states such as the Rif will be retaken, order will be reinstated in Equatorial Guinea and then, only then, will Spain look towards the future, into a new traditionalist state, built on the very foundations of Catholic social order, competent and confident military and total devotion to the crown of king Juan and the Bourbon lineage. The new regime is fully supported by the Spanish Catholic Church and especially Cardinal Gomá, who claims that the upcoming fight against the godless hordes is a just war according to Thomicist principles, and to him, the situation in Spain has progressed to the point that peace can only be brought to the nation by the power of a sword, until all enemies of the new order surrender."

sprd.312.d:0 "It is no real secret that Renovación Española is a rather elitist affair, compromised of the creme de la creme of Spanish monarchists, traditionalists and Maurists. Similarly, it is hardly likely that RE will ever be able to become a force for mass mobilization, unlike movements such as Acción Popular or the Carlists and their peasant supporter base, as RE with its leader Calvo Sotelo simply oozes upper class politics and refined politicking, not populist men of the people. However, if there is one group in Spain that is highly likely to be converted to our side, it’s the military men of the Spanish army, navy, Legion and even officers of Guardia Civil, lured in to RE’s promises of a strong, unbowed totalitarian state of Spain, unafraid to mete out swift justice to traitors of the crown.\n\nThe party already has strong supporter base within the army as well, with men such as lieutenant colonel José Cruz-Conde Fustegueras and rear admiral Ramón de Carranza and Fernández Reguera, who do not currently hold actual offices within the military due to advanced age and political commitments, but who do possess a strong network within the army and navy and could help convert relatively politically uncommitted military men such as Francisco Franco, Juan Yague and Manuel Goded Llopis, who nonetheless hold monarchist or conservative sympathies. However, the high command is likely harder to convert than many of the younger officers, lieutenants, captains and even other, lower ranks, given that these men are less entrenched in the political traditionalism in Spain and are more easily lured by the promise of a strong, centralized state that idolizes the military might of Spain. Many within our Green Beret paramilitary are already members of the military, and thus we could expand their role in the army or provide benefits for military men joining their ranks, to ensure the indoctrination of army troops to our particular ideological variation of Spanish monarchism and conservatism.\n\nThis is vital not only from the point of view of our party expansion, but also as it will ensure the loyalty of the military, only force left in Spain that can hope to oppose us now. Increased funding to the budget of the army for officer training, equipment acquisitions and colonial reinforcement ought to buy the loyalty of certain military men. There will of course always be firebrands within their ranks who will not approve our rather radical transformation of Spain, such as general Quiepo de Llano and Cabanellas, alongside socialist officers such as Julio Mangada Rosenörn, but we can always attempt to dislodge them from the military due to their loyalties being removed from the regime at the helm of Spain, so their resistance is bound to be short."

In the letter, Pla created  metaphora of the current state of Spanish internal affairs by comparing it to two cities. Spain under AE is on its way to construct a heavenly city of God's children, prosperous, pious, blessed and patriotic. It is contrasted by the opponents of our regime, the godless communists, socialists and anarchists who seek to build an earthen city, one that turns its back to the heroism displayed by Spain’s glorious martyrs in the past and to God himself. This new Gomorrah or Sodom, will only bring disdain, destitution and destruction to our noble lands, as was seen during the republican years and in 1936, when the Catalan terrorists, whipped into frenzy by the republican rhetoric, performed an attempted act of regicide.\n\nThe glorious resurrection of Christian Spain must begin, and with the republicans and syndicalists swept aside, a Catholic social order will be built, as befits the king’s new realm. The new regime will largely empower the church to carry out matters of ‘spiritual’ regeneration, and the church has increased support to Acción Católica, a Catholic laymen’s organization, to better facilitate an approach that is close to the needs and wants of the people themselves. Rest of Spain will see infrastructure and housing projects started on the rural areas to improve these regions after the damages caused by anarchists, separatists and Carlist extremists.\n\nSame applies to loyal cities such as Sevilla, Madrid and Toledo, whereas areas rife with anti-Hispanist rabble rousers such as Basque Country, Catalonia and even Andalusia and Galicia will be taught a lesson in civility and humility. Only once these regions are properly cleansed of their anti-Castilian ideals can they join the heavenly city AE is working so hard to create. Spain will be built back on the backs of the numerous holy martyrs lost during this period of immense strife, and only the Garden of Eden or the Holy Father’s heaven can truly match this future splendour of resurgent Spain."

However, despite the nation-wide witch hunts for separatists, some regional groups have been mostly left untouched, usually groups that have collaborated against anarchists or socialists. Parties such as Dereita Galeguista and elements of the Partido Republicano Agrario have helped Guardia Civil and Guerillas units in suppressing the revolts of Galician anarchists and syndicalists from the fishermen’s unions, and in Catalonia, the Lliga Regionalista has been mostly left untouched despite the ambivalence of Francesc Cambó towards the rule of Acción Española.\n\nRecently, numerous followers of Ramiro de Maetzu and his Hispanist majority faction within AE have pointed out that the Catalan leader has personally described his ideology towards Spain as ‘Hispano-Catalanist’, claiming that Catalonia benefits more from being part of Spain and developing as a region without equal within it. This is clear reference to the situation of Catalonia as the most industrially developed region in Spain, but it has caused much uproar among Hispanists, who view this as parasitic and completely contrary to the ideals of Maetzuist Hispanism. The Catalans have earned their wealth not through honest labour and innovation like Castilians, but by utilizing their exploitative capitalist practices, as can be clearly seen in Compañía Hispano Americana de Electricidad, a Spanish-German company in which Cambó has a considerable share in.\n\nThis company is based in Argentina, and is known to be rife with corruption to such a degree that it would make even Alejandro Lerroux blush. The most fanatical Hispanists want Cambó hanged for slandering the name of Hispanism with such regionalist notions, but others have pointed out that as the strongest remaining political force tied to Catalanism in the region, attacking Lliga Regionalista directly would cause more issues than a couple regionalist delusions ever could."

sprd.315.d:0 "The Hispanic mission of Acción Española here in Iberia is still ongoing, and it will take many long years to see de Maetzu’s vision fulfilled, but already, the party looks outwards into the New World and the many kindred spirits we hold in those distant, yet familiar lands. So far, Ramiro de Maetzu and the rest of the Hispanist clique of Acción Española has mostly viewed Hispanism as an ideology for the revitalization and unification for the people of Spain, but de Maetzu has never had a solely Iberian-focused view to the ideas he espouses. In his eyes, the resurgent right-wing Hispanism encompasses the Latin American nations that used to belong to Spain two centuries ago.\n\nIn the foreign policy of AE, relations with Latin America are of utmost importance, and will be focused heavily on the dual purpose of protecting the region from American influence and ensuring that Catholicism and Hispanic culture never gets pushed out by enemies of these holy creeds. This makes AE a natural ally to paternalistic caudillos, nationalist military men and pious civilian politicians, especially the righteous men of the Peruvian army and most importantly, our most stalwart allies in the Hermandad Peruana, led by Castillo Reva-Agüero. Similarly, we have sought to establish connections to other pro-Spanish groups in the Caribbean region, such as the Puerto Rican Partido Nacionalista, and even individuals such as the Ecuadorian diplomat Julio Tobar Donoso.\n\nWhile our approaches to Hispanism may vary, and there is of course some degree of mistrust by the locals towards our intentions due to the colonial past, with some even claiming that the approach of AE is far too paternalistic and self-serving, many militarists and Hispanists are happy for the support given that they either need international legitimization guarantees or simply support for relatively fringe movements. For now, much of the diplomatic work has been done to create connections and networks in the New World on top of our existing ones, to better facilitate economic and political cooperation in the future, with talks between Latin American states and Spain possibly resulting in the creation of an international body called Organización de Estados Hispanoamericos, which would allow for broader approaches to diplomacy and trans-Atlantean cooperation against American influence. While these plans will take a while to be set in motion, they could become a great tool in harnessing the true potential of both Spain and its former colonies ."

sprd.316.d:0 "The influence of Charles Maurras and his Action Francaise on Renovación Española cannot be understated, as many members of the party, such as the writer Álvaro Alcalá-Galiano y Osma and engineer María del Pilar Careaga Basabe, are heavily inspired by the French far-right theorist. However, perhaps the strongest turning point towards this Maurrasisme ideology was the meeting between Jose Calvo Sotelo and Maurras in 1934, during a state visit as the Spanish Kingdom and French Nationalist State expanded their mutual relations. Calvo Sotelo returned a changed man, having completely abandoned his liberal conservative and Maurist ideas for a far more radical position, and while he had shown tacit support for the Republic during the 1932 period, the man was now the staunchest enemy of the republicanism in Spain.\n\nAfter dislodging Antonio Goicoechea from the party’s leadership spot thanks to effective political maneuvering and the somewhat lacking political charisma of Goicoechea, Calvo Sotelo would transform the party program towards fully Maurrasian principles. The party’s militia, Green Berets, small as it was, would take more influences from the Camelots du Roi, the party itself would boot many of the Maurist conservatives and any notions of liberal conservatism would be scrubbed off from RE wholesale.\n\nThe Catholic monarchy has grown to be the lynchpin in a battle against Masonry, republicanism and liberalism in Spain, and as RE seeks to create an even more organic society, the Catholic parties of the new Spain must be united under one front, a National Bloc, against forces of chaos. This is perhaps the greatest deviation of Calvo Sotelo from the thought form of Maurras, as Calvo Sotelo seeks to create a large Catholic front against the enemies of reaction. \n\nNegotiations with Partido Agrario, Partido Nacionalista and Accion Popular have already been heavily underway, and while Gil-Robles himself has refused to ally with who he considers to be dangerous fundamentalists, after some support from RE, AP’s internal dynamics have pressured Gil-Robles to abandon his position of resistance. The National Bloc will ensure that the mistakes of 1931 will never come to pass again, and the monarchist order will sustain itself through cooperation, concentration of resources and shared faith in God’s rule on Earth."

sprd.317.d:0 "The monarchist tendency known as integral nationalism, or more commonly as Maurrasisme, is not a massively influential current in our neighbouring Nationalist Spain, but the Master, as Charles Maurras is fondly known among his followers and admirers, is nonetheless a true titan of French politics and integralist thoughtforms world-wide. His ideals of France are in turn contrasted by those whom he calls Anti-France, most notably Jews and Masons. This current of thought is hardly unique either, with all Spanish right-wing parties being anti-Mason at the very least and usually attributing Judaism to syndicalism, communism or republicanism. However, Spain itself has a population of around six thousand Jews, and in the aftermath of the Sanjurjada coup and the subsequent authoritarian consolidation around Renovación Española, many Jewish citizens have fled to Tangiers, a site of about six thousand Jews as well, and further, to Latin America, Central Europe and Morocco. As such, anti-Semitic voices are growing scarcer and scarcer, but some hardliners, such as Álvaro Alcalá-Galiano y Osma and the chronicler of the Bourbon monarchy and great personal friend of Alfonso XIII, Julian Cortes Cavanillas, still insist on persecuting the few remaining stragglers. Both blame Judeo-Masonic influences for the original fall of the Bourbon monarchy, with Cortes going as far as to blame a Jewish syndicalist assassin for poisoning general Primo de Rivera during his exile. However, most of Spain’s right is far more ardent in their support for anti-Masonic causes, and see these witch hunts of prominent Jews in Spain as a waste of resources, especially given that most have left Spain to avoid persecution anyway. Calvo Sotelo and Goicoechea, the two leading members of RE, have never been particularly fervent supporters of this cause, but the party opinion is not particularly strong either way on the matter, and thus men like Cortes could convince them."

sprd.318.d:0 "Throughout Spain, monarchist and traditionalist groups resisting the effects of regionalism have popped up, usually dominated by local nobles, prominent politicians and businessmen. These organizations, clubs and parties have long fought Aranaists in Basque Country and the followers of Francesc Macia and Prat de Riba in Catalonia, crushing separatist ideas and supporting true Hispanic patriots wherever they are. Groups such as Derecha de Catalunya and Peña Blanca in Catalonia, Acción Ciudadano in Andalusia and Liga de Acción Monárquica in Basque Country have all driven the supremacy of Spanish governance in their respective territories, but after the victory of Renovación Española, Spain no longer needs to rely on such decentralized form of anti-separatist resistance. As such, given that many of these groups are chaired by members of RE as well, it is only natural that we should absorb them into our organization. However, others have noted that we could also target groups belonging to Acción Popular’s wider organization, seeking to sway them to our cause. Parts of Acción Popular in Galicia used to be run by prime minister Calvo Sotelo before his defection to RE, and we could exploit those connections, given that Galicia houses numerous groups such as Unión de Derechas y Agrarios de Lugo, Unión Regional de Derechas de La Coruña and Unión Regional de Derechas de Pontevedra. Other groups of AP may be harder to sway to our side, especially hardline legalists like Rafael Aizpún of Unión Navarra and Derecha Regional Valenciano of Luis Lucía Lucía. Nonetheless, a victory in Galicia would improve our position greatly already, especially as we integrate other regional groups. However, many hardliners of the party, such as the ardent monarchist Santiago Fuentes Pila, have pointed out that taking in some of these Galicia social Catholics would likely cause our movement to veer more towards the moderate stance AP has taken in the past. The party is split on the issue, and it’s up to Calvo Sotelo to make the call"

Another notable development in this field has been the reopening of Raza Española, a cultural magazine seeking to highlight the good things Spain has done to the world and especially to South America, building connections between prominent Hispanists in numerous nations such as Chile and Peru and mending fences over shared history of imperial past.\n\nDescribed as menendezpelayista, after the historian, writer, politician and Nobel price winner Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo, the magazine puts great emphasis on the language and cultural traditions imposed to Latin America by Spain centuries ago, traditions that still remain in South America and are developed further by local intellectuals, artists and scientists. The magazine is led by the writer Blanca de los Ríos, a notable disciple of Menéndez, and it has become something of a club for former pupils of Menéndez to gather around, such as the philologist Adolfo Bonilla and the recently deceased Juan Gualberto López-Valdemoro de Quesada. The magazine was closed since 1930, when perfidious republican forces sought to disrupt such pro-monarchist and conservative safe havens, but as Blanca de los Rios has become more and more involved with the Hispanist tendencies of the new regime, she has decided to reopen the magazine with the help of her co-writers and editors.

No matter the reason, RE has nonetheless seen something of an uptick in support from women after their ascension to power, and there has been some degree of talks about starting a women’s section of the party, emulating the work done by the Carlists and their Margaritas organization for women. This task has been delegated to one of the few women in the movement, Pilar Careaga, an engineer and politician from Biscaya, who has tried to create an organization emulating the Auxilio Social organized by another far-right woman politician, Mercedes Sanz-Bachiller, wife of Onésimo Redondo, the founder of Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica.\n\nThe party has sought to utilize her talents in engineering as well, given that Careaga was the first woman to graduate with a degree in mechanical, chemical and railroad engineering in Spain, and her responsibilities have partly been related to these fields as well. Careaga has utilized her connections to other prominent women politicians, intellectuals and social Catholic feminists, such as Blanca de los Ríos and María de Echarri, to seek unity between the different Catholic forces for women in Spain in the creation of an unified group for RE’s women.\n\nFor this, she has sought to unify the women worker’s union Federación de Sindicatos Femeninos and Acción Católica de la Mujer, two organizations driving women’s rights from Catholic perspective, into a singular organization that could fulfill the original tenets of the Spanish Women’s Manifesto published all the way back in 1929, demanding that the state honours women’s right to vote and participation in politics, upholds their right to step up as representatives and allows for the pursuit for the ‘legitimate feminism’, contrasting the godless, liberal and socialist feminism utilized by Republican parties and politicians such as Victoria Kent and Maria de Maetzu. The reactions to these new maneuvers within right-wing women’s circles have been mixed, but given the prominence of aristocratic women within these organizations, there’s not much the more conservative sectors of Spain’s right can do."

Citing the resurrection of turnismo and return to old politics of corruption as their main call to action, Santiago Alba Bonifaz has returned to be the thorn in Count of Romanones’ side, just like decades ago. Most within Spanish military and in the inner circle of the Count consider him a pest and a corrupt sympathizer of socialist and republicans, but given that the regime had far more difficult enemies to deal with, few actually paid much heed to Alba and his small clique until now. Coming from a background of liberal reformism and regenerationism, Alba formed Izquierda Liberal, a collection of left liberals, progressive and even socialist reformists created in the 1910s, he would continue to be in politics until the Primo de Rivera coup, only to return in the 1930s as a member of the Lerrouxist radicals. Given his relatively minor status in Spanish politics in the 1930s, he was largely ignored, but now he has rallied the remaining liberals under the banner of resurrected Izquierda Liberal, seeking to challenge Count of Romanones given that the elections are technically held now. \n\nHe has called for increased programs towards welfare of the people, cuts to the army budget and abandonment of brutal Moroccan colonial regime in favour of a more civilian-oriented direction, earning him much ire from monarchist and Africanist officers. However, few expect him to succeed, given that the caciques are ready to intercept any political campaigns held in their territory. Radical monarchist officers within the army, such as general Valera, have noted that the regime of Partido Fusionista could simply have the army and Guardia Civil forcibly disband the group, but at least so far, Count of Romanones has sought to stand back and observe developments among the new party. Should they grow to become too much of a vermin to leave unattended, things may very well change, but for now, Spain’s liberals seem to have found a new playpen for themselves."

According to sources close to the Count, he seeks to work on his memoirs during this holiday, giving reins to the ministers of the government to serve the king in his absence. These sources claim that the Count is seeking to work closely with Real Academia de la Historia to ensure that the memoirs are accurate and detailed, and he also intends to set the record straight about the events of 1931, when the Count was one of the few members of king Alfonso’s appointed court to hand over the reins of governance to the republican forces led by Niceto Alcala-Zamora, with the Count personally instructing Alfonso XIII to flee Spain and seek protection in Portugal.\n\nThe Count, growing tired of the republican insults towards him from exile and the endless bickering of far-right monarchist groups who see him as the epitome of everything wrong with pre-Sanjurjada politics, hopes that this public explanation of his actions could help fight the tide of misinformation and slander fielded against him, though knowing the nature of his enemies, this may very well be a forlorn hope. Nonetheless, as the Count is quite advanced in age, the break is nonetheless needed, and is likely to not be the only one, as given the long and detailed history of Álvaro de Figueroa, his life may very well have enough to write about for decades to come."

sprd.323.t:0 "The Count of Everything"
sprd.323.d:0 "Given the past nature of Count of Romanones, it is rather odd that he now presides over an ultra-Catholic, right-wing and authoritarian Spain. He has always possessed a great deal of authority over Spain’s rural areas, but even in his own party, his rule has never been absolute, given the splintering of the group with the formation of Santiago Alba’s Izquierda Liberal and Manuel García Prieto’s Partido Liberal Democrático in the aftermath of party reorganization following José Canalejas’ death in 1912 in an anarchist terrorist attack. Despite the exodus of more liberal members of his party in the 1910s and 1920s from his party following Romanones’ ascension to power, one could hardly associate him with the conservative right of Spain today. Parties such as Acción Popular and Renovación Española, who are almost entirely devoid of any liberal influences and despise the very notion of that word in the context of monarchist Spain.\n\nThe new wave of Spanish politics dislikes Romanones not only for his liberalist remnant ideas, but also for him being a living manifestation of the ‘old politics’, the very era that Generation of ‘98 and young politicians like RE’s Calvo Sotelo and AP’s Gil-Robles, despise and hold as the very evil that led to Spain’s downfall in Cuba and Philippines. But despite all these turns and twists, all the rivals and straight up enemies the Count has, he stands as King Juan’s right hand. And now, through his many ventures, the Count has sought to increase his dominance beyond the caciques, into all areas of Spain’s political, cultural, economical and intellectual life. Through a magazine run by him, resurrected after being closed down in 1934, the cultural paper Diario Universal, the Count has gathered a large assortment of Spanish cultural and political elites from varied backgrounds, from the Radical and socialist politician Andrés Ovejero to the old school liberal and father of Spanish Georgism Baldomero Argente all the way to the Hispanist ultra-monarchist Ramiro de Maetzu.\n\nThis allows him to control the flow of political thought in Spain while also creating connections to all spheres of Spain’s politics, in addition to his numerous other newspapers and magazines that he either owns or contributes greatly towards, such as La Crónica, El Magisterio Español and Heraldo de Madrid. Economically, his ownership of large shares in key industries, such as in the iron industry through Sociedad Minera y Metalúrgica de Peñarroya, in shipping industry through Trasmediterránea and in banking through his shares in Banco Hipotecario de España make him a true titan of Spanish industry, making it quite hard for other industrialists to conspire against him. Same applies to landowners, who are almost as integrally linked to the Count through the immense amount of land Romanones owns. The right hand of the king is so heavily tied to all sectors of the Spanish society that his presence is felt beyond politics almost everywhere, and with the network of caciques in his disposal, Spain may only see change after the death of the Count."

sprd.324.t:0 "The Silent Fight Against Catholic Church"
sprd.324.d:0 "The Count of Romanones and Partido Fusionista have always held a rather poor view of the Spanish Catholic Church. While the Count is a practicing Catholic and many within PF are far more religious than their counterparts in other liberal parties, the Count has always fought Catholic church overreach, in 1905 supporting the Civil Marriage Law which liberated marriage from being a solely religious affair, and in 1910, helped in the passing of the Padlock Law, which would prohibit the formation of new religious orders on Spanish soil. Despite at times being an ally of the church, it is safe to say that the Count and the Primates, bishops and monastic orders of Spain hardly saw eye to eye in many matters.\n\nThe amount of caricatures of the good Count in the shape of the devil surely draw a tale of these relations in themselves. However, given the immensely Catholic nature of Spanish society after the recent upheavals and battles against republicans and godless anarchists, Count of Romanones and Partido Fusionista will never have enough political capital to truly secularize the nation and reverse actions taken by Gil-Robles and previous administrations. Doing so would lead to an immediate traditionalist and Catholic revolt, be it led by Acción Popular, Renovación Española or the Carlists. As such, the party has taken other ventures to try and limit church influence, by supporting and subsidizing Spanish education as much as they can in secular schools.\n\nMuch of the funding has gone to organizations the Count is already a part of, such as Real Academia de la Historia, Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas and Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernand, but other, even republican organizations have been granted funding as long as it hurts the church’s program of rapid expansion. In areas like Basque country, religious operations such as the ikastola system, a mix of school, nationalist cultural centre and religious teaching platform, has been cracked down hard, shutting down both official and hidden gathering grounds on the pretense of combating nationalism, but also to fight the growing Catholic influence. While this may very well be a losing fight, the Count is determined to continue it, holding firm on his secular beliefs."

A giant of Basque nationalism, he was a founder of the Euskalduna shipyards, one of Spain’s main shipbuilding facilities, but his influence also expanded to insurance markets through his La Polar company, railway construction and even banking through his stakes in the Banco Bilbao Biscay Argentaria. de la Sota’s participation in shipping was most notably demonstrated during the Weltkrieg, as his company’s ships suffered greatly at the hands of German submarines while leased to the British navy for service.\n\nWhile the British lost the war, de la Sota would be granted the title of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire by George V, for the merit of being a “a good friend of England and its people” during the last years of the Windsor’s reign on British Isles. De la Sota’s influence within Basque nationalism can also not be understated, as his pragmatic vision of nationalism steered the hegemonic Partido Nacionalista Vasco into adopting more autonomist positions when compared to the staunch separatist visions of Sabino Arana, the other key nationalist in the region. Time will tell if the passing of this venerated figure of the movement will affect PNV’s internal politics, but for now the region mourns the loss of their only Knight."

This suit, made of vulcanized silk and multiple layers of helmet glass ,for blocking different hazards, had a metal frame with folds similar to those of the accordion, and a great deal of work had been made to create a bulky and sturdy suit which would still allow for articulate movements required to operate instruments. A cloak was attached to the suit to protect the wearer from solar and cosmic radiation. The pressurized suit was tested rigorously on the ground level, and after issues with build-up heat from the human body were fixed, the test could be performed.\n\nWhile still far from perfect, the stratonautical space suit seems to function well at heights normally unsuitable for human pilots, and while the technology we possess may not be capable of launching humans into space yet, the suit itself seems capable of tackling the challenge. More tests will be carried out at a later date, but news of Herrera’s achievement have sent the nation into a frenzy as people raise their eyes to the night sky and dream of once touching the marvels it possesses thanks to the pioneering new gear. The government has granted more funding towards the program, and many private citizens from wealthy backgrounds have offered to pay for the equipment and training required to fund such expeditions.

Many presume that this nomination by the Royal Court is meant to placate the left-wing Spaniards during the troubling period in Spain, and this is presumed to have been the reason for Picasso to accept the position as well, as he is known for his pacifist stance. The famed painter has recently worked on his Minotaur-period, as he calls it, relating to the numerous statues and paintings of bulls, bullfighters and related subjects present in his pieces.\n\nAlong with Georges Braque, Picasso is known as the father of Cubism, a very modern and unorthodox art form making rounds among the various revolutionary (in various meanings of the word) artists of the world. The Prado Museum is one of Spain’s crown jewels, housing some of Europe’s most groundbreaking art peaces and timeless classics from hundreds of years ago. Even the powerhouses of European industry and politics envy the collection present in Prado, and the title of its president is not given out lightly, so many expect the Spanish culture circles to have a far more favourable view of the monarchy given this particular concession.

The JCAH members attacked a group of JONS members as they were exciting a public house after a rowdy gathering, and while initially the standoff was mere exchange of insults and accusations, it soon devolved into a proper fistfight, with some members on both sides even arming themselves with knives and cudgels. The Guardia Civil unit on patrol at the capital soon arrived to the scene and managed to disperse the crowd after firing a few shots in the air, but unfortunately only two jonsistas and one JCAH member were captured, the rest making their escape to the back alleys of the city.\n\nBoth organizations remain highly problematic to the government, as while JCAH is not particularly opposed to our regime, they are known to have beaten up moderate members of Accion Popular for ‘collaborating with liberals, Masons and syndicalists’. JONS is far more dangerous however, as they hold ties to the Chater Totalists of the Internationale and are known to have formed an unstable but nonetheless concerning alliance with CNT-FAI.

However, he considered German and Spanish conservatism far too reactionary and compromising with the enemies of true Spanish spirit, especially in their tolerance of liberal businessmen and Jews. Redondo had organized non-syndicalist unions in the past, and this led him to adopt more corporatist ideals, taking the concept to the point where he called for the entire nation to be organized around unions, led by a government of pious, youthful and traditionalist men, capable of sheltering Spain from the contamination of liberalism and syndicalism.\n\nHis organization, while small, has attracted many young radicals who struggled under the stagnated organizations of both the Carlists and Alfonsists. Redondo is a known advocate for radical Hispanism  and his ideas of the concept are heavily tied to race and religion, with him denouncing the regionalist ambitions of Basques and Catalans. Contrary to most Spanish right-wing parties, Redondo is also openly anti-semitic and has been avid reader of international anti-semitic literature, such as those circulated by Henry Ford.

The state would then create an united structure overcoming the classes of Spain, leading to the fading of class struggle that keeps the nation divided. The regime would allow for participatory, direct democracy without political parties to install their corruption and bureaucracy to shackle the people.\n\nWhile there are those within the movement who support the installation of Catholicism as an inherent part of Hispanism espoused by Ledesma, this wing of the movement has been sidelined after a shaky alliance with CNT-FAI was brokered.

While not officially a member of the German economic sphere or alliance, General Sanjurjo has guided the nation towards Germany slowly but surely both economically and politically. The Germans have proven to be quite interested in visiting our warm-water ports and islands, especially the islands of Canaries and Balearics, leaving the mild weather of Central Europe to bask in the warm sun of the Mediterranean and African coastline. Spain is relatively easy to access for these upper-class German aristocrats and the advent of Zeppelin travel has made it somewhat accessible for the Reich’s bourgeoisie and middle-class clerks. While German naval strongholds such as Malta and Crete remain more popular destinations, Spain has become a lucrative location not only because of its cuisine and culture but also because Spanish prices tend to be quite a bit lower than those of the German tourist trap locations.\n\nThis avalanche of visitors has not been limited to those of the Mitteleuropa, for British-Canadian and French officers and administrators are known to visit the island of Mallorca quite often, usually in secret from their commanders. This has vastly increased trade in the formerly quite forgotten island, and this development in turn has helped the economies of Valencia and Catalonia region expand to fit the needs of the tourists. However, there have been some negative changes as well, especially in relation to visitors from Entente. The deaths of multiple British officers, falling to their deaths from the numerous Mallorcan balconies while intoxicated, has been rather awkward to the reputation of the local accommodation venues, sometimes leading to wider international incidents.

Businesses are leaving en masse, and those that remain do so more out of the inability to leave rather than any trust in the return of prosperity.\n\nThis change has been seen even in the coffers of mainland Spain, as Valencia and Catalonia suffer from the lack of tourists and the trade they brought.

Actors Imperio Argentina , Miguel Ligero and Manuel Luna return from Rey’s earlier work, the movie Nobleza Baturra released a few years earlier, and continue their streak of Spain’s finest acting work.

However, it would appear that complete collapse has been avoided, as the German film producers have reached out to CIFESA in hopes of collaboration. This has resulted in the creation of the relatively small studio Hispano-Film-Produktion, which has partnered with CIFESA to circulate Spanish films in Germany and vice versa. They have also released the first fruit of their collaboration, the film Carmen, la de Triana.\n\nThe film, directed by Florian Rey, once again explores the themes of exotic Spanishness and interracial love, as the film shows a love triangle between the famed bullfighter Antonio Vargas Heredia, Guardia Civil Brigadier José and a Romani woman named Carmen. The cast includes  Imperio Argentina, one of the rising stars of Spain’s acting scene, as well as Rafael Rivelles and Manuel Luna. The film has not reached the heights of Rey’s earlier work with Morena Clara, but it did well enough to warrant the production of more German-Spanish collaboration works, such as the upcoming La canción de Aixá and El barbero de Sevilla, coming later this year.

American manufacturers Ford, General Motors and Chrysler have also delivered on the expectations placed on their vehicles, although the instability present on the other side of the Atlantic does somewhat weigh on the drivers and mechanics of these manufacturers.\n\nGerman and Austrian manufacturers have also brought some of their finest vehicle stock forward, with giants such as Porsche and Daimler competing with their American rivals on the visibility of the crowds. The Automobile Barcelona car show is held on every other odd year, and it’s popularity has soared from the original small circles of Catalan upper bourgeoisie to encompass rich folk from not only Spain’s higher social strata but wider European rich families. The ongoing instability in Spain obviously shadows proceedings, but for the most part the show has gone swimmingly, with many expecting this year’s Monjuïc Circuit to be a spectacle once it happens right after the end of the motor show."

Nonetheless, today’s race is expected to be tight, with the earlier years’ champions Louis Chiron of Alfa Romeo and the two winners from Mercedes, Luigi Fagiola and Rudolf Caracciola, engaging each other on the road for the glorious price of the event.\n\nThe air is heavy with fumes as the cars roll to their spots, and the roaring of their engines fills the air like the bellows of great beasts. When the flag waves, the cars shoot off and the race is on. Spain’s own Carlos de Salamanca is hopelessly overmatched as the pilots of Reichspakt’s finest take the lead, and despite the bold attempts by Chiron, Mercedes takes the price as Fagiola’s vehicle barrels through the finish line after a series of harrowing curves and break-neck speed takeovers on the narrow roads of Catalonia."

sprd.363.d:0 "Spain has a long legacy of building airships, dating back to 1907, when, with French help, the Astra company built the nation’s first airship. After the Germans emerged victorious in the Weltkrieg, their great interest in Zeppelins made them natural collaborators to Spanish experts on the field, and perhaps the greatest achievement of this collaboration was the creation of the Cadiz-Buenos Aires airship route. The Spanish company Sociedad Colón Transaérea Española partnered with the German Südamerikanische Gesellschaft Zeppelin. An agreement was made that Spain would build two airships locally, the SCA1 and 2, and the Germans would provide the Zeppelins Z121 and Z126. The smaller Spanish vessels operated the distance between mainland Spain and the Canary Islands, while the German-made Zeppelins would carry the passengers from the Isles all the way to Argentina.\n\nThis agreement has generally been a massive boon for Spanish air industry, but after Black Monday German transportation needs towards South America have dwindled down, and this has hit the coffers of SCTE notably. However, many Spaniards see the route as a complete necessity, for the trade connections made to the New World during the last decades have been invaluable to the buildup of Spain’s industry. As such, the government and leadership has proposed that larger subsidies would be paid to SCTE to keep the company going, at least until the lifespan of its four vessels ends, but ultimately this might be a way too costly of an operation to maintain during these difficult months of austerity."

Las Hurdes originally released all the way back in 1933, expecting to get past censorship due to the liberal regime of the republic, but the Sanjurjada coup and restoration of the monarchy meant that the film never stood a chance at making it to Spanish theatres.\n\nIt had been made with the help of French surrealist poet Pierre Unik and filmmaker Eli Lotar, notorious member of the Communard agitator group Groupe Octobre, so the Spanish military government immediately saw the revolutionary aims of the film. After the ban, it was expected to never reemerge in public consciousness, but these hopes seem to have been naive. The French and their collaborating Spanish brethren seem to have changed the film’s narration to French, and now it circulates the cinemas of France and Britain.\n\nThe movie is a scathing account of the situation of Spanish countryside, depicting the supposed misery of the situation in these regions. While even the current Spanish government admits that the situation of our latifundios can be somewhat difficult, Buñuel’s account is clearly meant to be exaggerated and it is known that during the process of the filming, he purposefully caused the deaths of two animals to drive his point home. However, among the Communard circles, the revolutionaries are lapping the propaganda piece up as a masterpiece, and they’ve used it as an example of the dangers of capitalism and reactionary conservatism of the Spanish crown. The Spanish government has obviously demanded for the film to be removed from cinema schedules, but as expected, the French have declined to comply."

This new design uses the most up-to-date aerodynamic rotor developments, and utilizes the earlier Cierva C.30A as a base for its chassis. A copy of the French Salmson engine licensed from the aerial developers of the Algiers is installed to power the new machine, and it takes the design of an autogyro to a completely new level, as its three blades are attached to the rotor hub through inclined flap and drag hinges to give jump-takeoff capability, a first in the development of rotor-powered aircraft.\n\nThis new development has piqued the interest of military and civilian aviators worldwide, and especially the Germans, just starting with their Focke-Achgelis copies of Cierva’s wonders, have expressed interest in the design. Cierva, restless as always to push the design further, has partnered with numerous British exile autogyro designers, and has announced that the next project, the Cierva W.11, nicknamed Air Horse, is already in initial drawing phase. According to Cierva, the lessons learned with C.40 will be added to the new design, which will ditch the autogyro set-up and instead aim to have a fully working helicopter arrangement, something only dreamed of by foreign designers. While some sceptics have expressed doubts at such an arrangement being unfeasible, Cierva remains unbothered, and expects the design to be airborne in early 1940s."

Torres Quevedo will likely be remembered as one of the geniuses of Spanish academia for centuries to come, as his advancements in the fields of aerodynamics, automation, shipbuilding and mathematics. Probably his most known achievement is the El Ajedrecista, an electromagnetic machine created in 1912 that was capable of playing limited amount of chess moves, which, while limited against experts of chess, was an excellent example in machine programming and demonstrated that machines could potentially be instructed to perform roles even beyond these relatively limited purposes. He fulfilled this idea after the construction of a typewriter-calculator in 1920, another first in the field of utilizing analytical engines.\n\nHis interests weren’t only limited to the field of mathematics and automation, but Torres Quevedo also developed various aerial and naval designs, such as an airship guiding system capable of being used in ports, a two-hulled naval ship with separate engines called the Binave and the Astra-Torres airships developed with the help of the Astra company and French experts, which were the first examples of dirigible airships in Spanish service. He was also a strong supporter of the Esperanto language, and frequently spoke it even in private and public settings.\n\nA devout Catholic, he was often expressed to have had a somewhat explorative stance to his personal faith, and was known to read the catechism multiple times a day. His final words were recorded to have been ‘Memento homnia, quia pulvis eris et in pulverem reverteris’, or ‘Remember, man, you are dust and to dust you will return’ if translated from Latin. The death of Torres Quevedo has been a blow to the scientific community worldwide, and many scientists regardless of the ideological divides present today have reminisced on the life of the marvellous scientist."

The trainer, first ordered in 1934 and now finally in the phase of entering air force service, has been a welcome addition. As a monoplane trainer, it surpassed its two biplane rivals, the venerable HS.34 and  Adaro 1.E.7, bringing Spain’s domestic air production finally to the modern era by adopting a single wing. While not revolutionary in any of its characteristics, the plane has already proved itself, first in a flight from Barcelona to Agadir by pilots Ramón Torres and Carlos Coll as it demonstrated rather strong long-range capabilities.\n\nThis flight was soon eclipsed as a single-seat GP-2 surpassed Torres’ and Coll’s achievement, when piloted by Lorenzo Richi, the plane managed a flight from Madrid to the Spanish Equatorial Guinea, travelling at a rather brisk speed of 187 km/h. Spanish industry still has a long way to go until domestic fighters can be manufactured, but GP-2 is sure to provide our men with a great deal of experience in the new monoplane vehicles for years to come, and whenever the transition to local monoplane fighters arrives, our pilots will be ready for the trials and tribulations it will bring with it."

Around fifteen men were taken into custody but far more managed to flee, including the leader of the group Elias Gallastegi.

This surge in radio transmissions has been noticed by the entertainment industry as well, and numerous radio shows have been launched country-wide. One such show is from a well-known trio of songwriters and copla artists, known locally as the Quintero, Leon and Quiroga after its three leads, Manuel Quiroga, Antonio Quintero and Rafael de León.\n\nThe group first met in 1932, after being hired by the famed bullfighter Antonio Márquez to perform alongside her lover and Spain’s arguably brightest copla star, Concha Piquer. Since those days, the trio has gone on to create thousands of songs, and their radio show is a bright light in the days of many Spaniards, who otherwise struggle with the harsh realities of current day Iberia. The trio, alongside Piquer, have popularized copla to such a degree that it has begun to appear in multiple films, most notably in the recent Morena Clara. The Andalusian trio has made great strides towards popularizing it in other countries as well, and especially de Leon’s aristocratic connections have helped them spread the genre into French National State, Germany and Austria.\n\nThe copla genre is inherently Andalusian in origin, and it has especially reached wider audiences as many copla songs go against the grain of the conservative monarchist government, as they often detail the lives of Spain’s lowest classes, such as sailors, prostitutes and criminals. While this has riled up certain conservatives in Spain, especially the Carlists of Andalusia and members of Accion Popular’s traditionalist wing, the popularity of the trio has made them too important to be censored, and some within the government’s more liberal side have even suggested that we fund their radio show.

This isn’t her first tour either, as in the early 1920s Piquer toured the United States for many years until returning to her homeland. Said tour was a great success and stepping stone for her career, but the instability ailing the Americas has made such a tour impossible for now. However, as copla has been introduced to Germany and its allies through the solid successes of Spanish films, Piquer expects a very warm welcome as she begins her musical journey in Germany.\n\nThe announcement has made many comedians around Spain speculate just how many luggage trunks the singer will take with her this time, as her last visit to the United States revealed a peculiar habit. Piquer tended to rent entire houses for accomodation while travelling, and thus would carry enormous amounts of baggage wherever she went, with linens, sheets, costumes and other textiles taking the vast majority of the space. Curiously, her husband carried two entire baggages simply for olive oil, as apparently the singer could not leave her homeland’s important cuisine cornerstone behind. Nonetheless, the state has sponsored part of her journey as a diplomatic mission, in hopes that this promotion of Spanish culture will bring people to visit our nation’s southern shores."

sprd.371.d:0 "To this day, property rights in Spain remain a hot topic, especially in rural areas where the large landowners dominate the market through their latifundios, massive estates where workers toil on rented property, or worse, as temporary seasonal labour. As economic hardship has engulfed Spain, proposals for alleviating it are raining in to the government in a downpour, ranging from radical transformations to moderate reforms. However, perhaps most curious has been the lobbying and debates of the Spanish Georgists, through their movement organ, the newspaper La Reforma Social, edited primarily by Baldomero Argente del Castillo. The ideology of Henry George has primarily been limited to the United States in influence, but at the start of the 20th century, a small circle of Spanish intellectuals from right- and left-wing parties organized the Liga Española para el Impuesto Único, aimed at introducing single tax system in Spain.\n\nIn Seville during a period of reform in 1914, Blas Infante led a group of local members of the Liga to propose the implementation of the tax to fund the Ibero-American Exhibition, but this notion was turned down and while Georgism would still be promoted by famous figures like Infante and Joaquin Costa, it would slowly die down in relevancy. This was, until Baldomero Argente began his vacancy at the head of La Reforma Social, and in two years the paper has revitalized the ideas of Georgism due to the lack of true reforms in Spain and the political capital of Aldomero, with him being a known member of Primo de Rivera’s administration.\n\nWhile their political relevance remains low, many parties both on the left and right have begun to consider some of the ideas of Georgism as a possible supplement to their main ideals. Still, Georgism remains a minor force within Spanish politics, but should the political field of Spain stir from its lethargy, the ideas of Henry George could very well reach a whole new audience."

It would seem that the Republican-era regionalist movement, Junta Liberalista de Andalucía, has been resurrected by local regionalists, under the perfidious Blas Infante. Infante has been on the run since the restoration of the monarchy due to his republican and socialist leanings, but now it seems that he has used the chaos going on in Spain to begin promoting his  Andalusianist ideals once more. JLA was, in its infancy, a movement aimed at supporting autonomy of Andalusia similar to the proposed autonomy of Catalonia and Basque Country, and curiously enough a large part of JLA’s ideology was the creation of an uniquely Islamic-Andalusian identity, supporting the revitalizing of Andalusia’s Islamic past as one of the strongholds of Muslim rule in Iberia, while also recognizing that the region is Christian.\n\nMade up of many different ideologies, such as the more moderate agrarian socialist Infante, federalist republican Alfonso Lasso de la Vega and the radical socialist revolutionary Juan Alvarez-Ossorio, the movement is divided in most policies but united in their shared disdain for the Madrid government and their fervour in realizing the ideals of an autonomous, if not even an independent, Andalusia. While this party is far from the nationalist threat of the Basque separatists or Catalan terrorists, they are still a movement that could very well cause problems to the Spanish monarchy and thus must be monitored and suppressed if the chance to do so appears."

The creation of Asociación Hispano-Islámica, a small group of Moorish-Andalusian and Moroccan nationalists have formed in the region around the local journalist Rodolfo Gil Benumeya. Gil, a Moorish Muslim born in Granada, has long been involved in Hispano-Moroccan relations, and served in Rif as a journalist for multiple different periodicals during the reign of Primo de Rivera.\n\nHe has been able to avoid persecution from officials despite being a self-proclaimed Andalusian nationalist, as his rhetoric has often called for the inherent Spanishness of Moroccans, though with the caveat that he also thinks Spain is inherently Moroccan as well. Mostly ignored by officials before despite this eccentric view, his new group has raised eyebrows around the colonies after the AHI’s claims that Andalusia’s destiny lies in union with Morocco, not necessarily with Spain, a view Gil Benumeya has adopted from Moroccan nationalists. While he still reconciles that Andalusia is Spanish in nature, he considers the ancestral and religious ties of the Moors to the other side of the Gibraltar Strait to be far more important than the binding of Andalusia to Christian Spain that happened after the Reconquista.\n\nAccording to Spanish intelligence operatives, Gil Benumeya has been encouraged to adopt this more radical position after his recent trip to Cairo, where he met with other Arab and Moroccan nationalists, notably Abd el Krim, the infamous leader of the Rif rebellion a decade ago. The whereabouts of Gil Benumeya and his movement are unknown as of now, with some speculating that he has returned to Rif to rally support among local troublemakers, while others suggest that he has instead joined Blas Infante’s band of Andalusian separatists.

These poets, who call themselves Garcilasistas, or alternatively Juventud Creadora, have met on the 400th anniversary of Garcilaso de la Vega’s death. The famous renaissance author was well-known for his exaltation of the poet soldier, and many historians consider him to be the man most important in bringing Italian renaissance style to Iberia.\n\nThese new Garcilasistas, who include poets and writers Luis Rosales, Leopoldo Panero and Dionisio Ridruejo, differ notably from the earlier Generation of ‘27 poets, writers and painters in that they are markedly more conservative, and in some cases, such as with Dionisio Ridjuero, involved with radical right-wing extremists such as Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica. The group also breaks from earlier generations of artists by focusing mainly on the usage of sonnet in their style, and the central theme of Garcilasistas is a recycled and modified form of the earlier Republican-era popular neo-patriotic warrior poet, but placed in the framework of the nation, religion and Castilian supremacy, alongside more general themes of love and death.\n\nTheir greatest inspiration seems to have been the chaotic and destructive situation of Spain, with all its different groups vying for power and clashing with one another, causing the Garcilasistas to yearn for a hero capable of appreciating and separating the beauty and love left in the world of chaos and violence of reality."

The colony of Rif, previously the location of the costly, if not catastrophic Rif War, is vital for Spanish economy due to the steel supplied by Minas del Rif company, but the government has continued to pilfer men and materiel from the colonial army to be used in the suppression of anarchists, socialists, Carlists and separatists back on metropolitan soil. However, while keeping order in Spain is of utmost importance, we cannot neglect the protection of the Rif as reports from our spies in Morocco and Cairo indicate that Abd el Krim has somehow made his way back to the former, and is planning to return to his native land for another uprising.\n\nAlready, Riffian tribals have ramped up their attacks on our men, and there has been a good deal of desertions among the Regulares as well. While there is no conclusive evidence of Abd el Krim being in Morocco, the rebel is far too dangerous for the Spanish government to just let the possibility to intercept him slip by. As such, the government is now tasked with the possibility of finding a way to deal with the issue of reinforcing the colonies.\n\nThe government could always just return the Legion troops brought to the mainland, but this would leave the defence of Spain to the hands of Guardia Civil, Carabineros and the reservists, who are basically untrained and unarmed for the most part. Another option is to enforce stricter control on the Regulares and to expand their ranks, but this would mean sending more officers into Rif to make sure that the colonial troops are not swayed by ideas of independence, leaving Spanish troops on the mainland less well-led. Finally, there is an option to hire foreign mercenaries, especially an American bomber squadron that fought in the original war, though it is dubious if these men will join our cause. "

Led by the famed globetrotter, Weltkrieg veteran and mercenary Charles Sweeny, the bomber squadron served alongside the French legion for roughly half a year, until they were forced to leave after the United States government intervened. Initially, the mercenaries were allowed to serve the French nationalists as the US government consider Abd el Krim to be a proxy of the Internationale, but as the war dragged on and the bomber squadron became involved in numerous controversies, such as bombing villages full of civilians and even targets that had surrendered, the American pilots were branded as war criminals using American bombs of Rifian babies. American media claimed that they would have supported the mercenaries’ involvement had they been fighting on the side of the Rif Republic.\n\nFollowing American demands for the mercenaries to leave, the French nationalists had no choice but to end the cooperation, and Escadrille Chefrienne left for their home once more. However, with America in chaos, Charles Sweeny has been looking for new opportunities abroad, and given that we have prior experience with working alongside these mercenaries, the government is presented with the opportunity of using their muscle to fight back the Rifian insurgency, no matter how low-level it may currently be. It would allow us to spare our elite troops from the Foreign Legion back here in mainland Spain, and we could simply supply the Americans with some of our older planes, such as the converted Beechcraft liaison aircraft bought from American companies."

Known as a apolitical reformer, he has worked in political roles as well, especially in relation to education, and his contributions to the history of Spanish law have earned him posts in judicial roles across the years as well, and he is known for being part of a process to create a network of courses and conferences that would make it easier for commoners and non-academic people to receive information and knowledge from the professors and doctors directly.\n\nHis influence in global politics has not been massive, but whenever Altamira has worked on matters of global justice, he has often emphasized restraint, commitment to peace and dialogue between countries and alliances, a stance that got him nominated for a Nobel Peace Price in 1933.

Starting in 1912, the plan was to construct such a reservoir in the region of Benagéber, but the works only got underway in 1931, when the Republican government agreed to the construction of such a massive project. Originally, engineer Fausto Elío y Torres was supposed to lead the project, but due to clashes between the engineer and general directorate, he was replaced with Carlos Dicenta.\n\nThe coup of Sanjurjada left the project unfinished, and more pressing matters meant that the reservoir was basically dead in the water, until now. To boost agrarian output in Valencia, given the lucrative properties in the region for growing oranges and grapes, the government has approved funding for the renamed Lucia Lucia reservoir after Valencian Accion Popular leader, Luis Lucia Lucia, replacing the Republican-era name ‘Blasco Ibáñez reservoir’, named after the famous Valencian Radical leader.\n\nValencian radicals have protested the change, claiming it to be yet another insult to their founding father, who they argue was the central figure of Valencian identity, even dismissing his political standing. Their complaints have largely been ignored, and construction is expected to get underway soon, bolstered by some usage of penal labour from prisoners captured in Catalonia and Valencia, usually belonging to radical terrorist organizations such as CNT-FAI, Nosaltres Sols or Estat Catala. These prisoners are compensated with shorter sentences thanks to their contribution, and it has allowed the government to cut down immensely on construction costs. The locals have also protested the plans, as the village of Benagéber is located right in the area of the reservoir and will have to be flooded. The plans would envision relocating these villagers to three different new towns around the reservoir, but the village leaders claim that this plan would see entire families and communities shattered to different locations.

According to Angel Cabrera, a Spanish-Argentinian naturalist and renowned zoologist, the Levantine Iberian wolf is smaller variation of the its more common cousin, and is distinguishable thanks to its reddish skin.\n\nSo far, actual eyewitness reports from credible scientists have not spotted such creatures in the wild, and recent reports have been somewhat dubious as they are mainly from uneducated peasants, and in one particular case, a local drunkard. The Murcia zoo does hold some specimens of this claimed subspecies, though due to various reasons, actual study into them has been somewhat slow, and Cabrera has struggled to gather enough interest towards the study of these possibly unique wolves."

sprd.382.d:0 "Recently, the Spanish government and high command of navy has been approached by an inventor by the name of Adrían Álvarez Ruiz. Ruiz, a member of RENFE company and a head of a workshop there, has cited that he has a fascination for underwater travel and diving thanks to being an avid reader of Jules Verne’s prose, and this fascination has led to him developing an underwater contraption, a tank that recycles air within an enclosed space located underwater. While the technology is not new by any means, as such techniques are used in rebreathers and similar devices, Álvarez has implemented the new device in a way that it is far more efficient and sizeable to allow for much longer regeneration of air. According to the inventor, it would allow divers and submarine crews to use this invention to survive for much longer periods underwater, should their vessel become damaged and in need of rescue. Originally, Álvarez tested the device back in 1932 and 1933, with decent success, and he was approached by German, Nationalist French and Internationale representatives for the purchase of said new device, but Álvarez wished to sell it to the Spanish authorities instead to benefit his native land. However, at the time Spanish authorities were dealing with civil unrest and administrative overhauling of immense scale, in the aftermath of the Sanjurjada coup, and thus no funding could be allocated to the project. However, the inventor persisted, and now that financial fortunes are a lot better for Spain, many view such a device as paramount to national security, given its many applications in military fields. However, the government is not uniform on the matter, with some suggesting that the funding is best used elsewhere."

sprd.383.d:0 "Many visitors of the mighty Rock of Gibraltar or the Spanish coast have often wondered why Spain and Morocco have not built a solid bridge over the Strait of Gibraltar, given the relatively short distance between the continents of Europe and Africa in the strait. Several ideas have been floated in regards to the idea, ranging from bridges to tunnels running under the seafloor, but the relatively deep water in the strait combined with strong currents have made the bridge idea unattainable. However, the idea of a Gibraltar tunnel was received with far more enthusiasm, and in the beginning of the 1930s, Spanish engineers attempted to experiment whether such a tunnel could be built into the seafloor, though much to their dismay, the basin rock of the strait was of such extraordinary hardness that no tools at the disposal of the Spanish government, or even any government in the world for that matter, could cut through it efficiently enough to make a tunnel possible.\n\nHowever, as Spain’s economic woes continue to heal, the idea has been floated once more, thanks to the continued insistence of Fernando Gallego Herrera, an engineer who previously suggested a solution to the tunnel issue. He envisioned a tube tunnel located around 20 metres deep, running through the entirety of the strait, allowing for car, train and pedestrian travel. This tunnel would be possible thanks to a design patented by Gallego already in 1928, the inverted gravity or flotation foundation system. The tunnel would have 65 tubular segments, two hundred meters in length and twenty-six meters in width, which would be attached to the seabed via special cables.\n\nDue to the complexity of the project and the distances involved in the straits of Gibraltar, the tunnel would be built entirely on land to facilitate better workmanship. Gallego, a competent engineer known for pursuing similar projects abroad as well, has received fame from creators of a similar system in the city of New York, the Holland tunnel designed by Ole Singstad, who saw the project as original and interesting, though he did not comment on the perceived viability of such construction. Should such a feat of engineering be achieved, Spain would have a far greater connection to its colonial holdings in Africa, though many view this as a waste of money when reliable ship transport already fills the same niche."

Catalan by birth, he finished his studies in the University of Barcelona and started work on mapping the planet Mars with a small telescope, though his interest in astronomy had started already at the young age of ten, and by the age of fifteen, his article would appear in a French magazine. Throughout his impressive career, he would rise to the position of first president of the Sociedad Astrónomica de España y América, much to the chagrin of two other Catalan astronomists, Salvador Raurich and Eduard Fontserè, who had founded Sociedad Astronómica de Barcelona a mere year earlier to celebrate the passing of Halley’s Comet, and now had to deal with a rival organization with a much larger scope.\n\nBetween the years 1900-1930, he would discover eleven asteroids, two comets, a dual star system and numerous other stellar objects, some of which would be named after him either directly, as a co-founder or under his nickname Pepito. He also influenced the field of seismology thanks to the detailed and innovative measurements Comas took from his observatory and others in the region, forwarded to other academics of the field. He was also heavily involved in relaying scientific information to the laymen, writing more than six hundred articles for the main Catalan newspaper, La Vanguardia, and publishing books such as the frequently cited Astronomía, the skeptical dissection of cosmologist spiritism El cielo, El Cometa Halley, El espiritismo ante la ciencia and the methodological work Ensayos de Filosofía científica.\n\nHis work in popularizing astronomy in Spain cannot be understated, and the society of astronomers in Catalonia and rest of Spain is sure to miss this great space explorer, and his funeral is bound to be a gigantic event. Comas has pledged his personal equipment and research from his home, Villa Urania, to the use of SADEYA. International tributes to the brilliant scientist have been enormous, and perhaps the most important have come from Academy of Nations and International Astronomical Union. The Spanish authorities have largely monitored these tributes without intervention, but many fear that Catalan nationalists may use the death of such a popular figure to promote their hopeless cause."

sprd.386.d:0 "The famous Sevillan painter Gonzalo Bilbao has passed away earlier today. Known as something of a nomad artist, Bilbao would almost never stay in one place, travelling throughout Europe to Italy, Spain and Germany in search of inspiration. During his career, he was greatly coached by José Jiménez Aranda and Vicente Palmaroli, and he would become known for both detailed and beautiful landscape paintings as well as a niche of his own, the so called Las Cigarreras, named after his most famous work. It was the best example of the man’s rather regionalist take on art, where he would promote certain regional cultural quirks and fan the fames of what would later develop into the separatist movements Spain sees today. Bilbao is thus seen as one of the most prominent Costumbristas, Andalusian artists, writers and painters whose art encapsulated the different specialities, aesthetics, social structures and historical realities of Andalusia.\n\nThis genre of Spanish art was heavily influenced by Bilbao, but mainly pioneered by Manuel Cabral Aguado Bejarano during the late 1800s, and in writing, in Prosper Merimée’s Carmen. The costumbristas would often depict Roma people, Andalusian dialects and landscapes, bullfighters, smugglers, flamenco dancers and other picturesque stereotypes of what the locals and international artists thought the ideal Andalusia would look like. During travels in France and Morocco, Bilbao became more and more interested in social realism as well, and the developing societal tensions between the rising and fading classes of society, between newly formed proletariat and the dying nobility in Europe. He would die holding a seat in Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, and according to his widow, the works still in possession of the Bilbao estate will be transferred to the Museum of Fine Arts."

Known as one of the finest portrait artists of the region, and as a member of the Costumbristas, Benlliure was famous for his variety in art, circulating between simple and grandiose themes, depicting daily life and epic historical events and veering into religious art at times. His most famous paintings The Rest on the March and The Flower Market could hardly be different in subject, one depicting a scene during a war as soldiers take a momentary rest, and the other depicting flower girls on a possibly completely fictitious market of Valencia.\n\nHowever, both are noted to have an incredible attention to detail, especially when it is taken into account that Benlliure was seemingly using very few brushstrokes to achieve his level of minutia. He learned from the best Italian painters of the time after travelling to the nation in 1879, and the Italian art movement Macchiaioli steered his career onwards like so many other Spanish painters. Benlliure would go on to visit the Spanish and French colonies of North Africa in the tail end of the last century, which also influenced his style slightly, though the Andalusian regionalist movement Costumbrista would lend the greatest amount of style inspiration to the artist.\n\nThe final tally of paintings before his death would amount to sixty-six paintings, but his contributions to Valencian literature cannot be understated, as he illustrated the book The Shack by the Valencian political boss and prolific writer Vicente Blasco Ibáñez and also leaned his artistic talents to the illustration of The Poverello of Assisi by Antonio Torró Sansalvador. His passing is likely to create quite the local event among the many clubs and art communes of the region, and given his connections to Blasco Ibáñez, it is likely that the Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista will pay tribute to the friend of their founder."

sprd.388.d:0 "The town of Piedrabuena has recently received attention for the numerous projects started by local inventor and millionaire Mónico Sánchez Moreno, who has provided the tiny town with electricity, a modern cinema and many other wonders of our age. This has all been possible through the man’s rags to riches story. The town of Piedrabuena of Sánchez’s childhood was an unassuming settlement of under four thousand inhabitants, scraping by through relatively unprofitable cattle farming, dry farming and other primitive forms of agriculture. Sánchez himself came from a poor family, his mother a laundrywoman and father a brickmaker, but his aptitude towards learning earned him praise from the local public school teacher, and eventually young Sánchez would apply for the School of Electrical Engineering in Madrid, though this venture was cut short by student strikes.\n\nFrustrated by the turn of events, Sánchez took his ventures overseas to the New World, arriving to New York in 1912 mostly without any money. In a time-honoured tradition of the American dream, Sánchez would work diligently to earn his pay and managed to find a place in the Institute for Electrical Engineers, eventually also taking courses in the Columbia University and honing his skills at mastering the art of electricianship. Sánchez would find work among American companies and used his free time to tinker with various projects and contraptions, most notably the X-ray machine. This new design would earn him the most fame, and Sánchez would become one of the key names in the trade, appearing in fairs alongside legends of the field such as Edison and Tesla.\n\nHaving earned a fortune in the region, he returned to Spain, to the village of his youth, and has lived there since, founding a laboratory to continue his experiments, building gadgets and creating local infrastructure to improve the lives of his fellow citizens. For a boy from a village where only one in four knew how to read, and electricity was something comparable to magic or miracles of the Bible, Sánchez’s story has been an inspiration to many aspiring engineers in Spain, and his influence in the village only grows by the day."

sprd.389.d:0 "The current year has been a busy one for one of Spain’s most prestigious zoologists, Ángel Cabrera. Recently, he discovered the species short-eared fox in the Amazon region, another species called araguato in lower Central America, and another primate southern red carayá in Brazil. In addition to these discoveries, he has finished his book named ‘Zoology’ and written multiple articles related to Latin American fauna. His new home in Argentina, a nation he has achieved citizenship status in since emigrating there in 1925, has benefited him greatly, and Cabrera himself has been a large inspirator of South American zoologists, archaeologists and mammalogists. Cabrera was born in 1879 into a rare Protestant family in Spain, and his father served as the first bishop of that faith in Spain.\n\nThis difference from the majority made Cabrera rather accepting of religious and cultural differences, further reinforced by his university degree in Philosophy. Despite the source of his degree, Cabrera would drift to natural sciences, and while he never attained a degree on the field through university study, his immense interest and aptitude to the research on mammals allowed him to receive multiple honourary degrees from different universities in Spain and overseas. His greatest break was assisting British military researchers led by Admiral H.Lyne to the Rif region, where Cabrera would live among the Rifians and learned to speak Arabic.\n\nHis research provided invaluable knowledge of the local wildlife, and he would return to Morocco multiple times later in the 1920s and 1930s. After settling to Argentina in the 1925, he has since remained relatively rare visitor to Spain proper, but his legacy lives on in the numerous species categorized by Cabrera, such as the Iberian wolf. Curiously, Cabrera is also one of the few Spaniards to receive a Papal bulla, as his marriage to a Catholic woman had to go through an application for an exception. While Cabrera may have become an Argentinian more than a Spaniard today, his inspiration to both Spanish and Argentinian natural scientists will continue to be relevant for decades to come."

sprd.390.d:0 "The town of Llívia in Roussillon, Northern Catalonia, has become something of a hot spot for Spanish-French foreign sabre rattling. The territory of Roussillon was ceded by Spain to France in the Treaty of Pyrenees in 1659, and despite multiple attempts and plans to regain this land for Spain, it never came to be. However, whereas all the villages and hamlets of the region were ceded to France in the treaty according to its wording, the town of Llídia remained. This was because of Llídia’s status as an ancient capital of the region, which made it be considered a town instead and thus exempt from the annexations to France, leaving it as a tiny exclave of Spain within a sea of new French lands.\n\nThe town would remain isolated and relatively forgotten part of Spain, until the collapse of the French republic following the end of the Weltkrieg. The Spanish Kingdom had debated the idea of intervention on the nationalist side as the revolution was in full swing, and some nationalists even wanted to take Roussillon and Labourd from France, but in the end the rapid collapse of the nationalists and retreat southwards made Spanish intervention seem like a losing fight. Only exception to this was the township of Llívia, where Spanish forces requested from France to reinforce the local garrison before the evacuation of Philippe Petain’s loyalist units to Algeria. The nationalists agreed, and the garrison Llívia was reinforced, not to stop a full French army attack but to keep raiders, small parties and possible local rebels from seizing control.\n\nAs the dust settled and revolutionary forces emerged victorious in France, in one of the few displays of Franco-Spanish diplomacy, the Treaty of Llídia was reinforced. The Communards, wary of being crushed by enemies from all around them, decided not to prod Spain and see if there is a retaliation by invading Llívia, and the town remains the same today, hosting around 700-800 inhabitants and a small military garrison. However, the comings and goings to the town and back to France proper are heavily controlled, and the paranoia of spies runs rampant on both sides of the border. Commune of France has held some military exercises around the town as well, as a matter of posturing, though for the most part the exclave exists in the same limbo it was originally cast in 1659."

Starting her career in music originally as a piano student, her remarkable voice soon caught the attention of Badia’s teachers, and her first public debut as a singer was during Wagner’s Parsifal at only sixteen years of age. She would rise through the ranks of Spanish musicians thanks to her skills at interpreting Spanish, Catalan and South American songs with immense vigour and joy that seemed to capture audiences. A large tragedy during her career came when Enrique Granados, one of her teachers, died alongside his family during the Weltkrieg when German U-Boat torpedoed the British SS Sussex the family was travelling on.\n\nBadia would dip her toes into the waters of opera singing in 1935 by performing the protagonist role in the opera María del Carmen, but it would appear that this experience was not something the singer wished to continue, as she has returned to holding concerts. The upcoming tour will take the Catalan prodigy to European cultural capitals, curiously enough to Vienna, Berlin and even Paris. Badia is not important merely for her artistic talents, but also due to her many connections to the greatest names of Spanish composer circles, such as Enrique Granados, Manuel de Falla y Matheu and Isaac Albéniz, whose works she has taken to completely new heights due to her performative power. However, recently she has begun to collaborate with the rising star of Spanish pianists, Alicia de Larrocha, and many experts of Spain’s artistic fields expect the pair to take their musical talents to a level never seen before. \n\nWhile the European tour is expected to take a few years, given the multiple European capitals Badia intends to visit, she already has her eyes set on another tour to the South America, where her husband Ricard Agustí works currently, and where Badia holds a considerable fanbase already due to past collaborations with notable Argentine composers such as Alberto Ginastera. While her sympathies to republicanism has earned Badia the ire of many more conservative sectors of Spain, she has also gained much fame by promoting the Spanish-speaking musical life so heavily around the world, while her Catalan performances have been a curiosity to the non-Iberian audiences."

This accursed book is a compilation of different Spanish, Latin American and translated international songs, from famous left-wing syndicalist sympathizers such as Silvestre Revueltes and firebrands of the Group of Eight from Generation of ‘27. The book, circulated by anarchist, socialist and communist agitators in areas such as Asturias, Catalonia and Valencia, has become a major hit despite the near-immediate ban on it because of its revolutionary nature.\n\nNot only has Mayer-Serra associated himself with the syndicalist menace, first in Spain and then in exile supporting the Communards, but he has also been known for collaborating with the Catalan nationalists. Underground cells of Communard spies, CNT-FAI terrorists and UGT unionists are known to circulate Mayer-Serra’s newest creation despite numerous crackdowns. Mayer-Serra’s fascination for Latin American music has intermingled with his interest in Communard politics, and thus many of his songs originate from the revolutionary regime in Mexico more so than from French Commune or Union of Britain.\n\nLocal songs from the anarchists, such as A Las Barricadas and Arroya la Bomba have also made their way into the songbook, much to the chagrin of Spanish authorities. In addition to his revolutionary songwork, he has published ideas of musicology and musical pedagogy on the republican exile newspaper Música, though this work has so far proven less popular than the songbook. In the polarized situation of Spain today, these mistakes should not be allowed to happen, but already socialist and anarchist songs are becoming more common place on the streets of Spain as an emboldened response to the Spanish Kingdom’s attempts to rein in the red menace."

Shocked and nervous from the impact, Almagro stumbled to his feet, only to be relentlessly attacked again. Eyewitnesses are unsure whether the bull that delivered the final blow was named Capirote or Rondeño, and even the provider of the bulls, the ranch of Domingo Ortera, was unable to discern this. Almagro was hit in the jugular vein, causing seemingly lethal amounts of bleeding.\n\nLocal doctors tried to save the man and even perform an ad hoc blood transfusion at the bullring, with one of the doctors volunteering to donate the blood, but despite these heroic efforts, Almagro could not be saved. The death was a grim one, as Las Vientas had thus far held a prestigious streak of numerous fights with no deaths, though Almagro had been injured before in the ring in 1935. His death has struck the local fighter community, as Almagro was known for being solid, reliable and skilled fighter if somewhat lacking in style, and his comrades in the trade, such as Natalio Sacristán Fuentes and Pepe Luiz Vázquez, have gathered funding for the funeral as Almagro has no family of his own in the region."

With the collapse of Hollywood influence, Spanish-German film industry has begun to flourish, and provides a great stepping stone for actors like Castro who are rapidly creating a name for themselves internationally. However, this may be Catalá's last project with the company, as she has begun collaborating with Carmen Carbonell, Antonio Vico and Manuel González to found a film company of their own.

The three men were found to be husbands of four women attempting to gain financial benefit from the deaths of their husbands, and in the case of the one woman, it was found that she was the mother-in-law of one of them, making Guardia Civil suspect that it was in fact more motivated by relationship conflicts than a monetary outcome.\n\nAll murders were tied to another woman, a local fortune teller often accused of being a witch, Magdalena Castells Pons, who had provided the other women with the ingredients and necessary knowledge to carry out the murders. The case became known as the Sisters of Solitude murders, and Castells was sentenced to thirty years in prison for the killings, while the four other women received sentences ranging from twenty-five to thirty years as well for being complicit or performing the murders.

In Valencia, this has recently led to an unfortunate side effect, after a young woman by the name of Teresa Gómez Rubio poisoned multiple people in the household she was working as staff for, leading to numerous deaths and one attempted murder. She had been working for the lords of Romaní for quite some time, and proven herself a great member of the staff, but unbeknownst to her coworkers and employers, Gómez’s husband had been taken to a nearby prison for pro-republican activities.\n\nHis girlfriend was determined to have the father of their child, the child having been born in 1931, released. To do this, Gómez sought to steal large sums of money from her employers, increasing the size of the peseta sums until the amount was almost ten thousand pesetas. This quickly aroused suspicions, and as the noose around Gómez’s neck tightened with the passing of days and the mounting paranoia, she begun to attack her coworkers through poisons. Her first victim was Teresa Domènech, who she murdered through spiking the victim’s coffee with insecticide. Domènech would survive the initial dose but Gómez gave her another drink with a similar amount of poison the later day, killing the woman.\n\nAnother employee of the Romaní house, Isabel Leonarte, and a visiting member of the Romaní family also fell victim to Gómez’s poisonings, and the final victim, Teresa Domènech’s sister Consuelo, was poisoned once but recovered enough to report the murderer to local authorities. Gómez was captured soon after, and despite attempting to disprove that the murders were her doing, she was imprisoned and sentenced to serve 142 years in prison. Her murders came out a time where the average Spaniard had been relatively desensitized to violence due to the decades of clashes and strife between different political factions, yet to the Valencian community, the Romaní killings have been a terrible tragedy due to the cold-blooded nature of Gómez and the relatability of the killer to many whose relatives have been imprisoned."

The Sociedade Pró-Olivença was founded in Portugal a mere week ago, and our spies in Lisbon report that it is primarily a pressure group meant to get the Portuguese integralist government more involved with the matter of Olivenza and possible reclamation of the town either through diplomacy or through arms. This argument is not entirely invalid, as despite nearly century and a half of Spanish rule, the town still overwhelmingly speaks Portuguese. The Portuguese government is likely to have far more to deal with in their African colonies of Angola and Mozambique given the recent instability and tensions between these regions and the Mittelafrikan behemoth’s ambitions.

However, recently a group of local artists from the magazine Gazeta de Arte, led by the famous Swedish-Canarian art critic Eduardo Westerdahl, Domingo Pérez Minik and Agustín Espinosa, has sought to change that. Given the recently announced plans from a British liberal aristocrat and great member of the artistic field Bernard Russell to visit the Canaries, the artist group has announced the creation of an exhibition aimed at showcasing the numerous merits of Canarian Surrealism, Ultraism and Futurism, Exposición Surrealista, held in Ateneo de Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\n\nThe Gazeta de Arte has been one of the central networks of Canarian artists, writers and poets, and its immense network thanks to the tireless work of Westerdahl reaches not only to the Spanish shores and intellectual communities within, but also European artists and cultural prodigies continent-wide. Drawing inspiration from Surrealists such as Salvador Dalí, Andre Breton and Benjamin Péret, the exhibition is dedicated primarily to French surrealism and also partially to Péret as he is the most influential surrealist in Latin American and Hispanic circles. Original plans apparently included inviting Breton and his circle of Surrealists to the grand opening, but the governor-general of the islands, colonel Amado Balmes, threatened to close down the exhibit if such an attempt was made.\n\nMuch of the ideas of the Gazeta have thus far been dedicated to exploring the greatest currents of European arts from the Canarian perspective, as the archipelago is often isolated from the wider happenings of the world. Nonetheless, with the great deal of buzz the exposition has attracted in Spanish news, many Catalan and Spanish artists are making their journeys to the wayward island chain, exploiting the more loose regulations on more left-wing art present in the island compared to mainland Spain, where the iron grip of Acción Popular, the military and the monarchy makes such open displays of resistance and insubordination nigh impossible."

However, it would now appear that there are more radicalization even in the island chain of Canaries, as the known syndicalist guerilla Guillermo Ascanio Moreno has started circulating the magazine Canarias Libre with her sister Blanca and another socialist by the name of José Miguel Pérez Pérez, who promote the independence of the Canaries in regards to Spain due to the near feudal conditions the local workers and peasants live in, controlled by powerful caciques who the local governor-general Amado Balmes is only more than happy to support.\n\nThese syndicalists are supported by more liberal forces in the Canarian society as well, as the Cuban-Canarian nationalist José Cabrera Díaz and his group Partido Nacionalista Canario, have supported Canarias Libre financially from their headquarters in Havana. Balmes has been instructed to crack down on the movement with extreme prejudice, but the local caciques, seemingly afraid of causing further social instability by chasing a small and insignificant fringe movement, have apparently managed to cause Balmes to look away this time. Should the movement grow and gather further support, possibly from the moderate liberals of José Franchy y Roca, a leader of the Partido Republicano Federal and the Partido Republicano Tinerfeña, the situation may escalate into further need for crackdowns. However, as of now the Madrid government has been satisfied with Balmes’ judgement, as the man, a veteran of the Rif war and a strong member of the military’s Africanist clique, is likely the most equipped to make such judgements given the isolation of the islands."

One of the minister plenipotentiaries assigned to this mission, Yakichiro Suma, has taken a big liking to Spanish art and culture and has become an avid collector of works. He was a former counsel to China and the USA before he was reassigned due to the recent instability in the country. Unbeknownst to his Spanish colleagues, he has been assigned with the task of setting up the “Agency of the East”, a spy network used to spy on western powers with its main hub in Spain, given its nominally neutral diplomatic status. Regardless, his collection, writings and cultural exchange efforts with his homeland have shone a new light on the two distinct cultures and potentially allowing for the forging of a new link between the two."

sprd.401.d:0 "The harsh terrain and conditions of the Rif and Spanish Sahara have made it so that whatever lifeforms inhabit these regions have had to adapt and evolve over a long period of time. The animals and plants that eke out an existence in the Atlas mountains are true masters of survival, and it would appear that sometimes, this mastery can even appear to defy extinction. The Barbary lion, a subspecies of the African lion, once called all of North Africa its home, but with the rise of cheap and easily available firearms even in regions as remote as the Rif, the lion quickly started losing ground to the humans of North Africa, and it was driven further and further into wastelands and incredibly isolated areas to survive. The situation was exasperated further as the lions were hunted for bounties, given that they were seen as pests and a threat to livestocks or camels in the region.\n\nAs hunting and ecological devastation lowered the numbers of gazelles and Barbary stags, the lions began to prey on human livestock, further increasing their persecution, and at the dawn of the 1930s, these noble creatures no longer exist outside of very scattered and hidden prides, usually numbering little more than a couple lions. These lions at one point lived all the way to the very edges of Sinai desert, but reports of them these days only appear very rarely and only in the most isolated regions of Morocco and Rif. The Moroccan royal family has some still left in captivity, but how long these animals may last is anyone’s guess. The Barbary lion may very soon follow the trajectory of the Atlas bear, a small subspecies of brown bears in the region that were all killed off after firearms became prevalent in the region and the European zoo craze caused these animals to become highly sought after accessories to the imperial glory of Europe’s cities."

sprd.402.d:0 "A sad event has struck today, as anarchist terrorists belonging to the Federación Anarquista Ibérica set fire to the crypt of the Templo Expiatorio de la Sagrada Familia, a Catholic basilica in Barcelona that has been under construction since 1883 and is widely considered the masterpiece of Catalan architect genius Antoni Gaudí. The fire itself did not cause much damage to the unfinished building, but the most tragic aspect of the attack was the destruction of Gaudí’s workshop, located within the boundaries of the construction site. These workshops had housed the master architect’s plans for the basilica, including 1:10 and 1:25 scale models of the finished structure. Gaudí had created these scale models in the later years of his life, fully aware that the undertaking he had taken in 1883 would need to be finished by those who came much, much later than him, and the destruction of these scale models has thus removed not only an invaluable piece of history but also one of the best sources for further development of Sagrada Familia.\n\nHowever, in what is perhaps a testament to the will of the Catalans, architects and faithful of the world, another local architect by the name of Lluís Bonet i Garí has requested that the remains of these plaster models made by the master would be delivered to him, so that Bonet could attempt to reconstruct them over the years. He has enlisted the aid of two other Catalan architects, Isidre Puig i Boada and Francesc Quintana, so that a replica of the original plans could be built to the meticulous standards of Gaudí. The anarchist perpetrators of this grave crime are still on the run, but it is believed that they belong to the Nosotros band of notorious FAI anarchist Juan García Oliver, which has already attacked numerous churches and converts all across Catalonia. The Catholic church has been furious at the situation, and representatives of the faith have demanded that swift and draconian justice be meted out once these terrorists are found, but given the chaos in Spain, few expect results when it comes to such a manhunt."

First, piles of wheat left to stand on fields were set aflame, and in another part of Laroya, a little girl was similarly set alight by an unknown source.\n\nBoth events had passers-by step in and extinguish the fires, so thankfully no further harm or wider spread of the fires was caused. The newspaper ABC published a large article on the matter, reporting that the fires are greenish-red and of such low intensity that they are easily put out, but that they appear almost out of thin air with little warning and while originally it was thought that these fires were the result of vapors rising from the ground, in many cases these fires have even occurred indoors.\n\nSome believe that the fires are related to a phenomenon known as St. Elmo’s fire, which has appeared throughout history in rather dramatic manifestations and is most often seen in the masts of sailing ships during storms. Instituto Nacional de Geofísica posited this as a possible reason for the fires, but has thus far been unable to find an actual answer to these mysterious fires.\n\nAs is so often the case with unexplainable phenomena, hordes of pseudo-intellectuals experts or religious leaders have taken these events as either manifestations of extraterrestrials, paranormal entities or, in the case of Spanish Catholic church officials, a sign from God. Whatever the case, the phenomenon seems to have appeared as quickly as it disappeared, as no new sightings of the Laroya fires have been forthcoming after the summer."

However, whereas dramas, comedies and documentaries have become a staple of the Spanish film industry and much innovation has been achieved in pursuing various genres, the idea of a truly Spanish war film has been eluding the industry until now. The famed director Antonio Fernández-Román, who kicked off his career in 1936 by releasing a ten-minute documentary on the Enchanted City of La Mancha, has recently expanded upon his already considerable talents by releasing the film Escuadrilla.\n\nThe film depicts a Spanish nation fighting a war against the French Communards through the perspective of two Spanish pilots, Lieutenant Alarcón and Captain Campos, played by Alfredo Mayo and José Nieto respectively. These two pilots are not only bitter rivals of the Communard air force in the clouds above the Pyrenees, but compete against one another on the ground for the affections of the same women, Ana María, played by the rising star actress Luchy Soto.\n\nThe film has been received very well by Spanish audiences, given the topicality of war in Spain at a time when it feels like the entire Europe is aflame, and the Spanish crown has been very quick to praise the patriotic film as a true marvel of domestic cinema.However, some critics have been quick to point out that the film is little more than a carbon copy of the films produced in the United States a few years ago to drum up patriotism and fighting spirit, and even those who have not accused the film of plagiarism have been quick to denounce its war-hawkish tone and predictable plot beats.\n\nNonetheless, seeing a truly Spanish war film has certainly scratched an itch for patriotism in Spaniards and the critics who openly attack the work of Fernández-Román have even on few occasions been accused of being unpatriotic or pro-Communard."

Thanks to the efforts of Spain’s archaeologists and researchers, more and more of these treasures are dug up in recent times, and sometimes, marvellous finds dating back to ancient centuries are unearthed in the most unexpected places. Recently, a digsite located in the town of Jerez, in Andalusia, provided the public with another priceless relic of old, when a group of diggers found an old Corinthian helmet from the ground.\n\nThis find has further solidified the belief that southern Spain had a good deal of Greek presence back in the glory days of Peloponnese city states, but the reason this find has become such a national phenomenon stems from a rather different situation. While the helmet was not found by the archeologist Manuel Esteve Guerrero, he has since become synonymous with it due to a photograph that emerged shortly after the find. In the photograph, a man is seen wearing the helmet, dressed partially in time-appropriate Greek gown whilst holding a cigarette. The man in the photograph is claimed to be Esteve, though he himself has remained silent on the matter. The photograph has become a common talking point among academia, with much of the old guard among the field claiming that it is evidence of gross misconduct with handling of a precious historical artefact.\n\nOthers, however, have seen it as an innocent photoshoot, especially after the image gained quite a bit of hubbub in the newspapers it was circulated in. As such, Esteve has been mostly saved from the ire of his most elderly colleagues, and the field of archeology has received a small but not insignificant boost in popularity. This has been highly welcomed by the academics of the field, as the recent economic downturn and political unrest have made the study of ancient artefacts and remnants particularly underfunded as capital is shifted towards more pressing matters."

From an early age he had already become a target for the Moroccan authorities, who wanted to stop the troublemaker once and for all. And so one day, he was invited over for dinner by his cousin Abd-el-Rahman Abd el-Saduk, who was also the Pasha of Tangier. Yet what he found at his residence wasn’t a banquet of the best delicacies money could buy in Tangier, but rather a group of the Pasha’s men ready to beat him up and capture him. From there he was sent to a dungeon in the city of Mogador, where he would remain chained to a wall for the next four years, only able to survive thanks to the kindness of the friends that were allowed to visit him and give him food.\n\nOnce released, he was a changed man, but not for the better. \n\nWhile out of prison, he went back to crime, although this time his preferred method was that of kidnapping officials for huge ransoms. One such incident was that of the Perdicaris affair, in which he kidnapped American citizen Ion Perdicaris for a seventy thousand dollar ransom to be paid by Sultan Abd al-Aziz whom he had grown to hate for what he perceived as the Sultan’s loyalty to European powers and where even then-president of the United States Theodore Roosevelt got involved to make sure of the safe return of Perdicaris, that being a non-insignificant contributor to his re-election campaign that year.\n\nHe soon became much more active in Moroccan politics, even aiding in the overthrow of Abd al-Aziz by Abd al-Hafid and gaining a position under his government, although he was soon thereafter forced out by the Spanish and turned back to a life of crime and harassing the Spanish presence in the area until he was defeated by Manuel Fernández Silvestre and joined up with Abd el-Krim in the Rif war. However, this wasn’t to last, as having grown jealous of his fellow bandit and his popularity and in a bid for personal gain, he defected to the Spanish in hopes of getting something out of it himself. This, however, was not to last, as he was soon tossed aside, having been nothing more than a pawn for the Spanish.\n\nFrom there, he has gone back to his old ways, partaking in crime and harassing the Spanish colonial presence, to which the Moroccan sultan turns a blind eye to and being small scale enough for the Spanish government to not bother to root him out. Yet now, with the murmurs of Abd el-Krim stepping back onto the land that saw his biggest victories and his biggest defeats, it won’t be long before the Rif is up in flames again."

sprd.407.d:0 "Earlier this week, the perfidious Rif rebel Abd el Krim, the man responsible for the horrendous Rif war fought for most of the last decade in northern Morocco, was spotted returning to the region. At the end of the Rif War, Abd el Krim was a local judge and civil servant to the Spanish regime before leading a campaign of resistance against colonial officials for half a decade, culminating in the near complete annihilation of his forces at the hands of the Franco-Spanish colonial armies. What started off as a series of skirmishes led by el Krim in the early 1920s led to a far greater conflict following the Disaster at Annual, where a large contingent of Spanish troops, mainly from the metropole, were slaughtered nearly to the last man, with the group’s leader, Manuel Fernández Silvestre, killed as well. The tribal allies and indigenous conscript turned against their Spanish masters, and the inexperienced conscripts broke down. Abd el Krim and his allies would decimate the colonial forces in Rif, leaving only a few pockets of defensive holdouts in Ceuta and Melilla. Only the intervention of French colonial troops from Algiers, afraid that Abd el Krim’s rebellion would inspire similar dissident groups in their final redoubt, was enough to end the Riffian resistance.\n\nThe joint Franco-Spanish landing at Alhucemas, first truly amphibious military operation conducted with elements from aerial, naval and ground troops, was the final nail to the Riffian resistance. Abd el Krim was forced to retreat, and his band continued to harass the Spanish colonialists until his escape to the newly established German puppet state of Morocco. The Moroccans had been hesitant to support Krim in his efforts, given that tensions between them and the French nationalists were high, but the Sultan in Casablanca turned a blind eye to the rebel and his remaining supporters until they managed to flee further into the friendly regime in Egypt. Many had hoped that the defeat of Abd el Krim had pacified the region of Northern Morocco, but such hopes seem fleeting now. The bandit ruffian, Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni, had thought that the Spanish would reward his loyalty with a fiefdom of his own, but when such delusions of grandeur proved false, he turned back to his criminal ways, and has managed to harass Spanish colonials and local government loyal to the Khalifa in Tetouan to this day.\n\nHad Raisuni been the only source of trouble, things would be a simple matter, but with the return of Abd el Krim, Rif is once more in fire. The rebel leader has thus far been unwilling to openly challenge the colonial order, but tribal warriors and ideological allies from Morocco and French Africa are flocking to his banner. There are even suspicions that Internationale, under a mission from Abd el Krim’s old ally and known British Maximist, Robert Gordon-Canning, is organizing resistance and supplying weapons to the Riffian tribals on a bid to weaken both Morocco and French nationalists. The Spanish military, tied to pacification efforts of the peninsula as anarchists and Carlists are brewing trouble, has been scrambling to find a solution to the difficult situation at hand, and unless one is quickly found, Rif may very well become a battlefield between the fierce tribal fighters and Spanish African troops once more."

Lerroux’s trajectory from a young flaming-tongued populist to the wisened liberal centrist has been nothing short of miraculous, and the allegiances of Lerroux are as shifty as the targets of his fiery speeches. In his youth, the liberal politician made a name for himself by attacking the church mercilessly, going as far as to threaten it with physical acts of violence towards clergymen and church facilities, and his masterful use of immigrant anger towards the Catalans in Barcelona made his party one of the rising stars of Spanish politics. Yet the 1920s were not easy on the man nor the PRR, and the party was forced underground by the Primo de Rivera dictatorship.\n\nWhen Lerroux emerged as one of the leaders of the republican conspiracy, Pact of San Sebastian, he had mellowed quite a bit, with his party splintering as a result. But the republican years showed that the sharp tongue of Lerroux had not dulled one bit, and Lerroux would emerge as the greatest defender of liberal democracy against the rising socialist and syndicalist revolutionaries or the anti-democratic demagogues of the right. The years following the Sanjurjada brought back some of his radicalism from the past, and while Lerroux himself never tasted the bitter regrets of exile thanks to his personal relationship with general Sanjurjo, the one-party state run by Acción Popular was the first and foremost enemy of Lerroux over these years.\n\nBut now, as Spain stands on the brink of chaos, the leadership of Acción Popular has seen fit to extend a call to aid to the old populist, hoping that his silver tongue could dissipate some of the hatred the republicans have for the current government. While it would appear to be a hopeless gesture given Lerroux’s lofty republican ideals, the man has few years left in him as time is creeping up on the old agitator, and he has seen the defence of Spain as the utmost duty of him and his party for now. This willingness to compromise on his allegiances will not come easy, and it is likely to be a bumpy partnership between AP and PRR, but if enough promises of democratic transition are thrown the Radicals’ way, they may very well support us to the bitter end."

sprd.500.d:0 "The republican project did not spawn from nowhere in the fateful year of 1930, but instead it was built by forces made up of life-time republicans such as Manuel Azaña and Alejandro Lerroux, but also by monarchist converts. One such convert was Niceto Alcala-Zamora, a conservative Catholic who held a much more progressive view of social issues and economy than is typical for the sphere of Spanish conservatism. Alcala-Zamora would become a leading figure of early republicanism with his party Derecha Liberal Republicana, contrasting the fiery social action of Izquierda Republicana and the deep-seated anti-clericalism of the Radicals. DLR and Alcala-Zamora were quick to denounce the hateful anti-Church laws of the republic, but even Alcala-Zamora’s status as the president of the republic did not stop the republican-socialist coalition from pushing their biased ideological caricature of Christianity further and further away from the Spanish society.\n\nDLR would sink in influence as a result of their stubbornness on the issue, and the party was further weakened when Miguel Maura, son of the famous Spanish conservative giant Antonio Maura, split off to form his own Partido Republicano Conservador. The situation did not develop much further before the Sanjurjada coup, and Niceto Alcala-Zamora would follow his republican comrades to exile due to his status as the president of the republic. \n\nNow, however, representatives of DLR have entered negotiations with the ruling Acción Popular on possible collaboration, with the regime indicating interest at thawing the authoritarian government by allowing republican moderates to return. With the help of DLR, the regime could convince even more radical republicans to return, which in turn would allow AP to form a more centrist core to Spanish politics, possibly leading to an end to the current crisis. DLR’s leadership was obviously cautious about the proposed alliance, seeing as Acción Popular has a history of fiery anti-republicanism and persecution of political rivals, but it would appear that the negotiations paid off. Many wonder if Niceto Alcala-Zamora can truly return to his earlier pro-monarchy positions, but the start seems promising for now."

But in reality, the relationship between social Catholics and socialists has not always been as set in stone, as the example of cooperation during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera shows. Unión General de Trabajadores, the primary Spanish workers’ union founded by the father of Spanish socialism, Pablo Iglesias, did actively collaborate with Primo de Rivera, seeing it as the lesser evil compared to complete illegalization of the union. The situation is obviously different now, and PSOE has undergone significant changes since with the leader of the UGT, Largo Caballero, calling for a revolution much more now than he did a decade ago.\n\nYet there are still those within PSOE who are not as hotheaded as the ‘Spanish Lenin’, as Caballero is increasingly become known as, and while UGT and PSOE have been outlawed, some of their exiled members such as Julian Besteiro and Ignalecio Prieto have entered negotiations to legalize the two groups once more in exchange for a degree of support, or at least ambivalence instead of outright hostility, to the Acción Popular regime. While these alliances are most likely highly temporary and incredibly volatile given the enormous ideological differences between AP and PSOE, the one thing both PSOE’s right and centre wings and the moderate wing of AP agree on is that a civil war or bloody, destructive and unpredictable revolution serve only the interest of far-left and far-right fanatics.\n\nAs such, while we may not be able to convince UGT to support us given Caballero’s influence within the union, we at least have the means to woo PSOE to our side for a short while in order to not collapse Spain to multiple warring factions. In exchange for their cooperation, the regime is expected to call off Guardia Civil raids on PSOE remnants on Spanish mainland, legalize PSOE and UGT again once the crisis is over, and most importantly, boot the useless king Alfonso from his throne and foster in a return to constitutional monarchy with elections held the moment Spain is stabilized once more. Some even called for Gil-Robles to resign and give his Prime Minister’s seat to someone like the moderate conservative Gimenez, but this demand was not met with much enthusiasm by most of PSOE."

The liberals consider AP to be the facade of Spanish reaction, attempting to gain legitimacy by posing as a democratic and accidentalist force only to sweep away all those pretensions the second the opportunity arose. For AP, the liberals caused the downfall of the republic through their uncompromising stance on secularism, agrarian reform and military downsizing, alienating any goodwill from the right especially after allying with the socialists.\n\nThese different outlooks have only grown to be a festering wound in the public opinion of Spain, causing a feud of immense proportions between AP and the likes of Izquierda Republicana, Unión Republicana and Partido Radical’s splinter factions. However, especially with the case of Unión Republicana, the party leader Diego Martinez-Barrio has shown himself to be a far more capable man when it comes to making compromises and difficult decisions than his long-time ally Manuel Azaña of IR. Martinez-Barrio has certainly not remained detached from anti-monarchist republican politics, but he has shown himself to be more capable of grasping the realities of the Spanish situation than many other republicans.\n\nIf AP were to feed into his hope for a return to democratic governance, even if under a king, the radical party leader may very well come to see it as the most viable option. Unión Republicana holds a significant sway among Spain’s intelligentsia, and has contacts with most of the republican parties in exile, so convincing Martinez-Barrio and his party members to at the very least collaborate with the social Catholics until the time of elections could be a gateway to wooing other republicans back to the fold.

sprd.504.d:0 "The Spanish militarized police forces  Guardia Civil, were first formed during the Carlist wars of the last century. As the Carlists mostly controlled countryside and raised peasants against the Madrid government, the defeat of the main Carlist force mattered little as rowing bands of former traditionalist troops would become brigands haunting the nation’s periphery until the next uprising came. Guardia Civil was the answer to this problem, but with the rise of anarchism and agrarian socialism in the rural areas of Andalusia, Catalonia and Aragon, the role of these police troops has evolved to account for this new enemy.\n\nArmed far more heavily than the regular police forces known as Cuerpo de Vigilancia, Guardia Civil acts as the first line of defence against anarchist and Carlist traitors. They also contain a great deal of officers sympathetic to the government’s cause, and the role of Guardia Civil in the coup of 1932 has earned then a role as the darling of Spain’s right. Therefore, getting their continued support for the regime is vital, for if Spain is to endure, it must be able to rely on the vigilant forces on the countryside. The loyalty of various military and police branches in Spain is often fickle, but by providing more funding and preferential treatment in terms of equipment allocation to Guardia Civil, Acción Popular is most likely going to earn enough favour among the rural police to keep them on the government’s leash should anything drastic occur."

However, beneath the surface, there are great differences in ideology and form of government, and the parties have highly differing views of the ruling Acción Popular party. To many on the extreme right, such as members of the conservative and military-dominated Unión Monarquíca Nacional, the Maurrasian-influenced Renovación Española and the traditionalist cultural forum Acción Española, the party is little more than opportunistic moderates and indecisive accidentalists seeking little more than power for themselves and their El Jefe, José María Gil-Robles. \n\nTo some, AP is a reluctant ally to, such as Partido Nacionalista Español, though these alliances have often been difficult given the aggressive and uncompromising nature of PNE. If AP wishes to ally with these nationalist forces and possibly find a way to create an alliance or at the very least a temporary ceasefire with the Carlists, the best bet is to start by aligning regime-friendly moderate conservatives and traditionalists.\n\nEasiest alliances to forge is to reel in the Agrarian right, especially the leading agrarian party Partido Agrario Español, as while PAE has limited power on its own, it is the leader of a wider agrarian alliance and has connections to agrarian movements all over Spain. In the past, there were talks about merging AP and PAE into one party, but in the current sticky situation that the government finds itself in, it is perhaps better to simply ride out the storm and seek such measures later. However, with the agrarians in AP’s coalition, the first step could be taken to unite all of the Spanish right under one common purpose.[GetSprd505IfUMNAccepts]"

As such, if the current Acción Popular government is to steer the nation away from the chaos swirling around its many regions, then it must be done with the help of one of Spain’s oldest institutions. Few parties in the right can rely on as strong of a church support than Acción Popular, however, as AP’s legalistic approach to governance and solemn commitment to upholding Catholic values has made them attract support from moderate and radical members of the clergy alike. These clergymen are not only a powerful ally because of the funds an alliance with the church can open to AP government, but also because the church influences the opinions of vast numbers of Spanish citizens. It’s often noted that especially conservative women are deeply affected by the opinions of their local priests, and in areas with a large number of deeply Catholic peasants, such as Extremadura, La Mancha and Galicia, the influence of clergy to public opinion is immense. Additionally, Catholic lay organizations such as Acción Catolica are not necessarily under the rule of Acción Popular, and some within that organization have disapproved of the party’s methods in the past, but they could be a powerful tool to bridge the government’s supporters and more moderate members of Comunion Traditionalista. After all, the greatest source of unity the Spanish right can have is their shared Catholic faith, and nowhere else are the seeds of cooperation as easy to sow as in organizations that foster non-partisan cooperation over party lines."

This man, Atilano Coco Martín, is a man of faith, but not in the traditional way of Spain, for he is the pastor of Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church in Salamanca, and a particularly known figure in the city at that. Originally joining the Partido Republicano Radical Socialista, after members of it merged with Unión Española, Coco was one of the first ones to join Martinez-Barrio’s new force of liberal radicalism, and his contribution to the rising new party have not gone unnoticed either among the party members or their opponents on the right.\n\nCoco has been instrumental in gaining support not only from Protestants around Spain, meager as their contributions overall may be, but also in gaining a few favourable statements from such liberal giants as Miguel de Unamuno, who has otherwise remained relatively critical of Martinez-Barrio’s staunchly secular party. Coco’s friendship with the liberal titan has however made Unamuno more supportive of the progressive policies of UE, but his Protestant faith has made him an easy target for the Catholic right, who have used Coco’s beliefs as a living proof of the ungodly alliance between faith traitors such as the Protestants and the devious iconoclast liberals.\n\nThey have been even further incensed as Coco is known to be a Freemason, belonging to the lodge Helmántica, which is run from his own home as the pastor does not have the means to acquire a different meeting place and the lodge’s small size of less than twenty members does not require a particularly large space anyway. While Salamanca does not possess a great number of Protestants despite having a congregation since 1879, Coco has become one of the key members within the city’s politics nonetheless thanks to his allies within academia and other political parties, such as PSOE, Partido Radical and Izquierda Española. Despite his heavy support of secularism, he has become something of a voice of reason within the party to rein in some of the more anti-secular members of UE, and his presence has made some of the more rational Catholics feel at ease with the new government."

When Spanish regionalism pops up in national discussions, it’s usually the famous areas such as Basque Country and Catalonia that make the headlines, but recently, Aragonese regionalism has gained more national credibility thanks to a member of Unión Española, Antonio Guallar Poza. Guallar is a man of a long political past, belonging first in Partido Republicano Radical Socialista of the Zaragoza branch before jumping ship to join UE, though he is noted to have been a loyalist within PRRS after the party broke apart following the leadership debate between Álvaro de Albornoz and Félix Gordón Ordás, supporting the latter, more orthodox line of PRRS before he inevitably joined Martinez-Barrio’s Radicals.\n\nHowever, whereas most of UE’s members do not exhibit that much support for regionalism, even if they do support it within the party’s integral federalist platform, Guallar is very much an Aragonese localist first and foremost. His success in the 1931 elections for the creation of the Spanish republic was very much down to his ability to mobilize local forces yearning for an autonomous Aragon, a region so long overshadowed in the struggle for local self-rule by its more riotous and noisy cousin in Catalonia.\n\nGuallar has demanded that UE pushes through a statute of autonomy for the region, and he has not been completely alone in this, as the Partido Republicano Autónomo de Aragón has supported his political drive in local matters, and even some members of the more radical autonomist group Estado Aragonés, notably the group president Gaspar Torrente, have come to publicly support Guallar. While his movement is small at this time still, given that Guallar holds no office of particular importance within the party at the time, his contacts within prominent local organizations such as Confederación Sindical Hidrográfica del Ebro, one of the key unions in local energy industry, as well as his allies within Asociación de Labradores de Zaragoza, may gain him enough resources and political support to drive the Aragonese autonomy program further than anyone could have really expected."

sprd.510.t:0 "The Hero Colonel of Unión Española"
sprd.510.d:0 "It is no secret that the Spanish military is crammed full of conservative and even traditionalist officers, and this has been even more so the case after the Sanjurjada coup, as much of the republican officer base was purged and only slowly readmitted back into leading roles following the thaw in the regime and return to democratic rule. Most officers have since flocked to the banners of right-wing parties such as Acción Popular, but there are others, shunned by their more reactionary colleagues, who have seen the new development towards a more democratic Spain as a means to get back at their former political enemies within the military. One such man is colonel Ildefonso Puigdengolas, who has recently openly joined Unión Española for the first time.\n\nHe is something of a republican hero, having been one of the first men to oppose general Sanjurjo’s coup in 1932 as he was leading troops from the front in Sevilla, and while his valorous efforts failed then, leading to the death of the republic and Puigdengolas imprisonment until his release in 1936, he was quietly celebrated by the republicans in exile. Even before the coup, Puigdengolas had been close to the ideology of Martinez-Barrio, and his long years in prison for the dual treason of serving the republic and being a Freemason further radicalised him to the point that with UE’s victory, Puigdengolas has abandoned his previous apolitical nature.\n\nMany expect him to provide the party with invaluable experience in dismantling the reactionary elements of the army when the time comes, for even if the republicans exhibit a bit more trust towards Acción Popular for having allowed elections once more, the military gets no such trust until proven otherwise. There are even whispers that with such a prominent military leader on their side, more republican officers may be convinced to join the fledgling radical party, but until substantial evidence of this arises, Martinez-Barrio must stay satisfied with the prospect of having his old ally to have finally seen their cause as the only righteous one in Spain."

sprd.511.d:0 "One of the ways Unión Española has sought to combat the strong influence of the church and the right-wing rural parties is via a rapid expansion in Spanish schools and other facilities of education. The model utilized in this expansion has been adopted from the writings of Francisco Giner de los Ríos, the founder and key ideologue of pedagogy for the Institución Libre de Enseñanza. ILE and Giner de los Ríos had begun operations already in 1876, with the aim of creating a network of education facilities not bound to any political, moral or religious body, heavily inspired by the academic current of the time following the ideas of the German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause. However, while ILE made great headway into their programs and network during the end of the 19th century and to some degree, in the start of the 20th century, all work ground to a halt during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship of the 1920s, as the highly Catholic and paternalistic new regime saw ILE as a hive of dissident thought.\n\nHowever, now, the nephew of Giner de los Ríos, Bernardo Giner de los Ríos, a minister of the Unión Española, has been chosen to lead a committee aimed at fulfilling the ideas of ILE, and provide secular and apolitical education to the children and youths of Spain. Bernardo is an architect by trade, and has been one of the leading pushers for the arrival of rationalist and functionalist current of architecture in Spain.\n\nThis has paired well with his interest in education, as Giner de los Ríos is working closely with the Ministry of Education to create a network of modern, distinct schools for the new program, and given the architect’s close relation with ILE has made him one of the strangest proponents of implementing the institute’s educational programs. Many within the government have hailed him as the man capable of fulfilling his uncle’s vision. He is not alone in this desire, supported by his sister Gloria Giner de los Ríos García, teacher at the resurrected ILE.\n\nGloria has adopted many ideas from Maria Montessori and the Spanish historian Rafael Altamira y Crevea, and implemented her own idea of teaching geography through so called enthusiastic observation, where students will be encouraged to feel a strong emotional connection to their surroundings, with literature such as travel texts being a big part of education instead of simple and straightforward textbooks. She also took many cues from American innovations while in exile there after the 1932 coup, as her husband Fernando de los Ríos Urruti was in the United States establishing connections to local left-wing organizations as part of the Republican exile. With such an enthusiastic crew to drive the ideas of ILE forward, both in educational norms and material form through Bernardo’s architecture, Spain is bound to reach a new era of rationalism."

sprd.512.t:0 "The Middle-Class Union"
sprd.512.d:0 "The space of trade unions in Spain has been traditionally filled only by socialists, anarchists and in some cases, Carlist and Catholic unionists subscribing to various forms of yellow syndicalism, social Catholicism and distributism. Despite some minor attempts however, there hasn’t been a truly middle-class union structure within Spain, with the only real example being Unió de Rabassaires in Catalonia, the viticultural union tightly linked to Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, which, granted, has started to drift leftwards as well. However, recently this has served as an inspiration to the creation of Unión Española’s new project, the Alianza de Labradores de España.\n\nDriven largely by Felix Gordón Ordas, the former leader of Partido Republicano Radical Socialista who joined UE after the fracture of his previous party, ALE seeks to unify the middle-class farmers, ranchers and other agrarian professions under one comprehensive movement, marked by progressive, liberal and at times, republican ambitions. Gordón Ordas has considerable experience in agricultural matters thanks to his civil professions outside of politics as a veterinarian, and in the 1920s he led a considerably innovative program to create a national registry of livestock for the benefit of Spain’s rural population, a program that was sadly ignored by the Spanish society at a time. Given that ALE would not act as a traditional working class union as most of its supporters are self-employed farmers, it would instead engage with other unions such as the socialist UGT union’s agrarian sister FNTT, as well as the Catholic unions, to better negotiate matters in the countryside when it comes to things like land redistribution, labour rights and tenant conditions.\n\nHowever, ALE aims to also attract tenants and sharecroppers of Spain's countryside, firstly to direct them away from more radical organizations such as CNT-FAI or FNTT, and to also expand the base of middle-class farmers by driving a further liberation of tenants to become actual free farmers not bound by unfavourable contracts. The initial success of ALE has been mixed, but as UE’s role in Spain’s governance increases, the union may very well grow to rival its Catholic and socialist counterparts."

sprd.514.t:0 "The Party of Law and Justice"
sprd.514.d:0 "Much of Unión Española’s support base comes from middle class government officials, intellectuals and business owners, but there is a very clear singular group of people who are attracted to the party of Diego Martinez-Barrio. That group are men of the law, attorneys, lawyers and judges, all attracted to Martinez-Barrio’s legalistic, moderate and conciliatory movement. Men such as the representative of Melilla Luis Barrena y Alonso de Ojeda, the mayor of Madrid Pedro Rico López and the judge and founder of the Republican exile group España con honra, Álvaro Pascual-Leone Forner, have given the party a very legal stint, and while Martinez-Barrio himself does not possess a position in law, his party is increasingly focused on persecuting their rivals, especially those of the church and reactionary parties, through the courts. \n\nLike bloodhounds, UE’s army of lawyers within the Cortes sniff out irregularities in parties considered enemies of the movement, especially those among their Radical rivals of Lerroux, and while this has been very effective strategy in dismantling the very monarchist and anti-liberal establishment in Spain, it has gained the party quite a bit of notoriety with some even accusing the party of trying to game the courts to its favour due to the large amount of experts in law, in order to support its drive at pursuing UE’s political enemies. This has led to some concern within Unión Española, with some fearing that this new reputation will cause some to accuse the courts of favouring the liberals, leading to a decrease in citizen’s belief in the tenets of the law. As such, some have supported that the party calls off its bloodhounds and focuses more on pursuing policy over fighting their opponents through judges.\n\nHowever, Luis Barrena, known as an avid crime fighter and pursuer of even highly scandalous cases in the search of justice, has instead suggested further empowerment of the courts, so that the powers that be can truly persecute those forces that seek to keep Spain from evolving towards its full potential. This is especially important in the context of the unruly military, bellicose nobility and ever-powerful clergy, who oft seem completely unchallenged by the civilian organs of the state. This new direction would certainly help in pushing UE’s more radical political positions through, but it would also hamper the party’s moderate image."

sprd.515.d:0 "With the return to democracy and stability in Spain, Lerroux and his Partido Radical have attempted to remain relatively constrained with repercussions aimed at those who conspired to topple the republic. Remembering the disaster of the early republican ‘political responsibilities’ campaign pursued by the likes of Manuel Azaña and Largo Caballero, the Lerrouxite Radicals have attempted to stay the long arm of justice from striking at too many enemies of the republic, focusing mainly to the most egregious examples of monarchist excess, such as the brutish murderers Juan de Ansaldo and Bruno Ibáñez Gálvez, but recently, the party has decided to pursue a particularly personal traitor to their cause.\n\nJoaquín Pérez Madrigal, a former member of Partido Republicano Radical Socialista and subsequently, Partido Republicano Radical, had served as a zealous republican radical before and during the republican years, but when the republic died in the military coup of 1932, he quickly went on to join Acción Popular, claiming that this decision was for ‘the love of the Fatherland, respect for the history of Spain and the fervent duty to strengthen and guarantee the development of Spanish society’. He would become one of the key propagandists of the new regime, slandering his former allies and lambasting the secular nature of many republicans, claiming to have found a fierce devotion in the Catholic faith. Pérez found an important position in the new national radio of Spain, and through his radio shows he would consistently attack republicans in exile while extolling the virtues of his new party’s government.\n\nHowever, as the greatest crisis Spain had faced in the 20th century began to fade, the Catholic conservatives cast him out to mend some bridges with their republican allies, and now, Partido Radical’s lawyers have struck the man through the judicial system, claiming that his radio shows incited supporters of AP to political violence even beyond Spain’s borders, and the propagandist has been condemned to a life in prison for his transgressions. Some forces within Spain’s right have called this act a shameless example of political targeting, but Pérez has few actual allies and many Spanish Catholic consider him an acceptable sacrifice if it means avoiding further targeted strikes towards them."

sprd.516.d:0 "The Radicals of Lerroux have a sizeable following all around Spain, but it is no secret that the heart of the party is, and will likely always be, Barcelona. However, given the electoral success of Partido Radical even under the new monarchist system, other branches of the party have started to flourish, and somewhat surprisingly, the Andalusian Radicals have managed to create a very forward-thinking, almost utopian thoughtform in the heartlands of Southern Spain, often marked by its Catholic character. Led by Eloy Vaquero Cantillo, a local teacher and poet, these Radicals are marked by their Andalusianist and grassroots approach towards the local workers. Vaquero himself has pioneered the concept of outdoor schools in his native town of Cordóba, where he works as a teacher and lawyer.\n\nThese outdoor schools would make the education of working-class people much more accessible, and this has led to a considerable increase in PR’s popularity in the region. Vaquero has also taken a page out of socialist ideas, despite his overt liberal ideals, and has been instrumental in organizing utopian self-managed communes for agrarian workers, with the aim of creating an institution that upholds social defense, charity, culture, and mutual support. The driving group, another work of Vaquero, is the Andalusian Regional Workers' Federation, which has been steadily growing and attaining working class support for the Radicals at a rate not seen since Lerroux’s most populist years in Catalonia. His idealism is partly also inspired by the teachings of Henry George, as Andalusia is the very cradle of Spanish Georgism, and Vaquero has been a strong proponent of the single-tax movement within Partido Radical.\n\nIn addition to his economic ideas, Vaquero has become, somewhat uncharacteristically for a Radical, a staunch supporter of Andalusian regionalism, founding Andalusian Center of Córdoba and allying with the socialist politician Blas Infante, the father of modern Andalusianism, to push for a more autonomist Andalusian region. Despite his support for this regional movement, however, he still holds strong anti-Catalanist ideals, especially at a time when Catalan workers are occasionally making their way to the southernmost Spanish region in search for work. He has also continued his poetic works even while holding political offices in Andalusia and on a national level, and his most important work, Senda Sonora, which only the title is currently known, is seemingly just around the corner. While Vaquero has not attained much prominence outside of Andalusia yet, many consider him one of the rising starts within Partido Radical, perhaps one day replacing the aging father of Spanish Radicalism as the head of the party."

sprd.517.d:0 "The development of feminism in Spain has been a slow but steady one, and while in rest of the world, this woman’s movement has begun to drift leftwards due to the progressive policies of the Internationale, Spain remains one of the central bastions of liberal feminism with its multiple beacons of centrist advocates for the rights of woman. Women such as Clara Campoamor inspire a great deal of awe among Spain’s middle and upper-class women, and as Partido Radical has managed to snatch victory in the polls, the strength of women’s liberal movement is only growing. Agrupación Femenina Radical, the party’s primary branch aimed at mobilizing women, has been steadily growing since the electoral victory, and veterans of the cause such as Teresa Giner and Dolores Climent have been instrumental in gathering support for their expansion.\n\nSo far, much of the work of Radical Women, or Red Ladies as they are sometimes also called, have been aimed at performing social work, with Giner going on record to state that the only reason she originally joined the Radicals was to help people in need. This top-to-bottom dynamic has sometimes led to critics claiming that the Radical Women are nothing more than maternalist do-gooders looking to earn a few sympathizers among the working class women due to a few alms, but it would appear that a growing number of especially Valencian and Barcelonan women of working class origin are joining Partido Radical thanks to the actions of the party’s women.\n\nHowever, Giner and numerous others share the opinion of the famous Spanish Radical-Socialist deputy Victoria Kent, in that they view women’s suffrage as a double-edged sword. If cultivated and allowed to flourish towards greater aims, the vote of women could very well make Spain more equal and progress the society of Spain out of the barbary of the past two centuries, but given Spanish womens’ subservience to the opinions of the clergy, many fear, and perhaps rightfully so given the success of Acción Popular in the polls, that women are nothing more than a tool for the right-wing parties because of their immense faith in the words of their priests. However, Giner and her allies hope that with time, this can be finally rectified as a more secular Spain rises under the maternal love of AFR."

Pedro Rubio Heredia, a member of PSOE and the party’s ally agrarian union FNTT, was shot by a man identified as Regino Valencia, as Rubio was leaving a local restaurant. Initially, police and Guardia Civil authorities passed off the attack as mere another example of anti-socialist violence perpetrated by reactionary actors, but further investigations and interrogation of Valencia have led these authorities to conclude that the assassin was a hitman on the payroll of none other than the Radical member of the government, Rafael Salazar Alonso. Salazar has been a strong advocate on cracking down upon the FNTT and other left-wing agrarian unions, limiting their ability to strike and even violently dispersing them if need be. He was a particularly fierce opponent of Rubio and his friend and fellow socialist Juan Simeón Vidarte, and this has made the confession of Valencia all the more convincing given the motive is there.\n\nSalazar has been quick to denounce this as a clear ploy from the more reactionary sections of Spanish society to make the Radicals appear like bloodthirsty murderers as a revenge for their anticlerical policies. However, given the results of official police investigation point towards the Radical leader, many within the party have decided that in order to minimize the fallout from such a disaster, it’d be best to simply kick Salazar out of the party and into a cell somewhere, even if he is not directly related to the incident. Otherwise Partido Radical may very well have to face yet another massive scandal if it tries to keep the man in his ministerial position, and at the very least, the agrarian and industrial unions aligned with PSOE will stir up a storm not seen since the dark days of 1936."

However, many have speculated that this need for friends does not come from a place of simple political shrewdness, but also from Lerroux’s family past. Born to a military family, his older siblings perished at young age bar for his brother Arturo, and he never received much warmth from neither of his parents, not from the absent military man that was his father nor the mother embittered by the loss of her children.\n\nAs such, young Alejandro would develop an almost obsessive need to gain friends, and this need to impress and enchant would later be used by the politician to gather his massive support base for Partido Radical through populism and clientelist strategies alike. However, it would seem that the pain of his upbringing has not yet left Alejandro Lerroux even at his old age, as his adopted son Aurelio, originally his godson and nephew, has been making steady strides within Partido Radical under his uncle’s watchful eye.\n\nMany feel that Lerroux is simply making up to his long-dead infant brother Aurelio by allowing his namesake to succeed in life, though the young Aurelio’s habits of accepting lavish gifts from ‘mutually beneficial third party actors’ has been a thorn in the side of Lerroux and Partido Radical. Perhaps if Aurelio overcomes his growing pains and learns to choose his allies more carefully, he can one day rise to succeed his uncle and adoptive parent, as may be Alejandro Lerroux’s eventual strategy, but for now, his prospects to be the heir of Lerroux remain nebulous at best."

sprd.520.d:0 "The circle of Radicals in Basque Country has been thrown into disarray upon the sudden proclamation of the leading Basque Radical, Juan Usabiaga Lasquíbar, that he will be stepping down from his duties. Usually such proclamations are done when a politician deems himself too old to continue, but Usabiaga has a far more personal reason as he is still in his late fifties. His wife Margarita Usandizaga is going blind, and the Radical politician deems it more prudent to tend to his wife’s needs than to pursue political glory in an increasingly contested electoral field as Carlists, Basque nationalists and rivals from Izquierda Española all seek to dislodge him from his seat. Usabiaga has done a remarkable career as a member of the Radicals, starting in 1916 when he ran in local elections but failed to beat the Carlist industrialist Esteban Bilbao, only to return the favour with his electoral victory during the republican years and then again during the most recent Partido Radical victory.\n\nWithin PR’s lawyer and academic-dominated political scene, Usabiaga has been a very conventional and technical man, willing to appoint men from across the political aisle when he deems them best fit for the purposes of the task at hand. For example, he has been a strong proponent of hydropower in Spain, creating a loose alliance of left-wing Radicals and even conservative monarchists to pursue the expansion of dams along the Ebro river, and recently he supported the known conservative innovator Fernando Gallego Herrera in his program to reevaluate the Gibraltar strait tunnel, a long-time dream of Usabiaga.\n\nUsabiaga’s civil profession as an engineer has no doubt influenced this rather technocratic view on governance, and his republican fanaticism has made him something of an easy target for the right-wing monarchists, yet his willingness to work with various Catholic figures such as the famed economist José Larraz López has mellowed their opinions on the man. Nonetheless, Usabiaga has been the strongest voice of Lerroux’s Radicals in the oft backwards and highly Catholic Basque Country, and his willingness to drag the region from its ‘troglodyte caves towards European modern civilization’ has made his sudden decision to step down all the more pressing. Whoever ends up replacing the veteran Lerrouxist in the region will have big shoes to fill, especially in a region so hostile to everything the ideas of Partido Radical stand for."

sprd.521.d:0 "During its tenure as the rulers of Spain, Partido Radical has done much to modernize Spain’s military to a degree deemed acceptable. The army has seen its officer corps slightly downsized, though Lerroux, fearing a similar backlash to the republican reforms, has merely attempted to remove officers known to be incompetent or too old for their duties. Numerous weapons programs and refurbishing efforts have been launched to better arm Spain’s soldiers, and fortification efforts in Spain’s northern border have been launched. Contrary to much of Spain’s liberal core, Lerroux and many within Partido Radical view that if Spain’s internal unity and national sovereignty is to be defended, the nation’s military must be honed to this task.\n\nPartly this fervent support of the army stems from Lerroux’s own family past, as his father and older brother Arturo were both soldiers and had fate not intervened in the form of a chronic shortage of money, Alejandro Lerroux may have very well been made a soldier as well. His alliances to the chief of Spain’s army, general Sanjurjo, have certainly not stemmed the spending spree either, but the most recent naval rearmament plan has left even the most hawkish military funders flabbergasted. Gerardo Abad Conde, the Radical minister of Navy, has brought out a plan to modernize Spain’s fleet, known as the Abad Conde Plan, which would see the construction of additional 2 minelayers, 6 torpedo boats, 12 motor launches, 12 torpedo boats, 8 minesweepers, 12 submarines and 12 barges.\n\nClearly not content with this bout of megalomania, Abad has suggested that the rest of the fleet, the two battleships Jaime and España be fully modernized alongside all the destroyers and cruisers in the inventory of the navy. All in all, the calculated costs would be 450 million pesetas, a sum that when brought to the Cortes, led to near immediate cancellation of the project. The ludicrous amount of money is considered impossible to be allocated to the naval arm at a time when Spain is still recovering from the financial ruin of Black Monday and the strife that followed that economic disaster, and even then, many consider the refurbishment of the fleet to be a far more pressing matter than creating new ships, for the Communard naval presence in the Mediterranean is very contested by their Reichspakt and French Nationalist enemies. This little episode has made many reconsider Partido Radical’s spending frenzy, and it is clear that whatever military budget revisions members of the party are seeking to bring to the government in the future, they will be eyed very keenly by rivals of the Radicals from now on."

Acción Popular and Partido Radical are both hemorrhaging voters to the new darling of Spain’s conservative moderates, and so far, the party has managed to avoid too many scandals thanks to the relatively restrained platform and corrupt-free nature of the party. However, it would appear that this calm has finally been broken by DLR’s mayor of Córdoba, Pascual Calderón Uclés, who has managed to acquire the ire of not just local people but the Spanish archaeological and historical academia.\n\nCalderón attempted to stop the local Festival of Córdoban Patios, a tradition the locals had attempted to resurrect earlier in the year. The Festival is an intricate competition taking place in various spots around the city, and it has been a staple of the city’s cultural tradition for quite some time. However, Calderón saw this festival as a highly disruptive ruckus that would disturb the city’s public order given the spread-out nature of how such a fiesta was organized, but Calderón had clearly underestimated the local resolve and love for this particular tradition.\n\nGiven that he was not a local by birth, many Córdobans soon turned on their mayor, and as protests for the reinstation of the Festival grew larger, Calderón was pushed out of his seat by other members of the city council to placate the riotous festivalgoers. Rafael Baquerizo García is currently planned to take over for Calderón’s spot as the mayor, and the whole situation has been a stain on DLE’s thus far spotless reputation, and one that is likely to affect Calderón’s career especially going forward.

Others joined their republican comrades in New York, Caracas and elsewhere, chief among them republican elites such as Miguel Maura and Niceto Alcala-Zamora. However, out of those who remained in Spain, few expected them to stand up and fight against the rising regime out of fear for imprisonment or other forms of political persecution, and yet, there were those who resisted.\n\nMost prominent of these men was José Reino Caamaño, a Galician lawyer by trade and supporter of DLR and later, Partido Republicano Conservador, who ran a surprisingly effective anti-government campaign in courts, defending his brother and other republicans from sentences pushed into session by AP’s malicious agents. His staunch condemnation of anti-clerical violence and strong efforts to shelter clergymen from anarchists and communists made him a difficult target for the regime to hunt down, and Reino would utilize this strong positions to wage his own war against authoritarianism through the courts. When his brother Carlos Reino Caamaño, former mayor of town of Verín and member of Manuel Azaña’s Izquierda Republicana was arrested for perceived crimes against the Catholics, Reino’s one-man legal struggle managed to get Carlos acquitted, though he soon fled to exile.\n\nUpon the return to constitutional normalcy, Reino has reappeared first as a member of Partido Conservador and then, after the reunification of the Maurists and Zamoristas, as a full member of Derecha Liberal. In addition to this, he has utilized his republican hero status to pursue effective democratization of his native Galicia, and outside of political field, his new status within the regime earned him a teaching position as professor in University of Santiago de Compostela. It is hoped that this vanguard of justice can carry out his tasks both on the political and academic field to completion, seeing a new generation of such defenders raise to fill his boots once more in the future."

However, Maura possesses above else one of the strongest cards to play when it comes to attracting monarchists, his family name and connections.\n\nFor much of Spain’s conservative right, the name of Antonio Maura, Miguel’s father,  is one to be revered, as he built but the famed Partido Conservador during the years of turnismo and led to the creation of much that constitutes the modern Spanish right, mentoring figures such as Jose Calvo Sotelo and Antonio Goicoechea. Beyond just the weight of his family name however, he also retains relatively close bonds to his moderate monarchist brothers Gabriel Maura and Antonio Maura, and thus he has been able to reel in the close circle of monarchists led by his brother Gabriel, known as Círculo Monárquico Independiente.\n\nThe circle is far from an uniform one, but it has a general liberal conservative stint and the transformation of DLE from a liberal centrist party towards a more Christian democratic party has been applauded by many within CMI even before the full integration of the movement to DLE. With this boost into the numbers of monarchists within DLE, the old scars of the republican-monarchist divide are finally starting to fall, and there’s even talk that the third politically active Maura brother, Honorio Maura, may reconsider his more extreme political positions to instead pivot towards the more moderate stances of his brothers."

The old Derecha Liberal Republicana was a relatively small affair, made up of centre-right progressive conservatives, while the Partido Republicana Conservador that first broke off from DLR was mostly made up of moderate Christian democrats.\n\nWith the inclusions of Gabriel Maura’s Círculo Monárquico Independiente and Joaquín Chapaprieta’s Partido Republicano Independiente de Alicante into the ranks of DLE, the party is an amalgamation of various moderate currents of Spain’s right, and many feel that the mostly liberal-progressive dominated party of Derecha Liberal does not serve as a particularly expressive name for the movement that Niceto Alcala-Zamora’s party has grown to be. As such, many have suggested changing the name to be more expressive of the desire of the party, that being a Catholic mass party situated between the more authoritarian social Catholics of Gil-Robles and the liberal secularists.\n\nAlcala-Zamora supports the changing of the name to Partido Progresista Español,  to pay homage to the original ideas that made up the party, while Miguel Maura supports the name Partido Conservador Española, to redeem the idea of conservatism within the eyes of the party. Gabriel Maura has supported renaming the party to Partido del Centro Constitucional, a short-lived party he created in the early 1930s when the fate of the monarchy was not yet sealed. However, there are many who view that the name Derecha Liberal has served the party well, and shows where the party came from, and do not support changing it to appeal to a more right-wing audience as the party is doing well enough as is."

sprd.526.d:0 "Recently, prime minister Alcala-Zamora has been in the news for a reason few expected, as the leadership of Guardia Civil presented a particularly interesting piece of memorabilia to the new commander-in-chief of Spain. This piece of history was none other than the personal sidearm of the Second Spanish Republic’s president, that being Niceto Alcala-Zamora himself, a STAR Model D, in all its damascened glory. The pistol was given to him by the Grupo Socialista Femenino de la Agrupación Republicana de Eibar, who had presented this product of the famous gunsmithing town as a gift to the president not only because of its price, having been plated with gold and engraved carefully by local experts, but also to protect the politician during the troubled republican years.\n\nThankfully, the president never had to fire the gun in action, and upon the collapse of the republic following the 1932 coup, the pistol was confiscated from Alcala-Zamora’s office by members of the Guardia Civil, who had been the strongest proponent of the troops participating in the coup. The pistol was stored in various warehouses and personal collections until now, when the headquarters of the police figured it best to put the past behind them and reissue the pistol the new prime minister in a gesture of reconciliation. The gesture is of course rather bittersweet to the republicans, but the prime minister accepted his new possession with grace. The gun will of course likely never see action, given the rather hefty security detail of Alcala-Zamora, but it will nonetheless amaze the various visitors of the prime minister’s office and serve as a source of pride to the talented guncrafters of Eibar and wider Basque Country for years to come."

sprd.527.d:0 "The politicians of Derecha Liberal have always strived to create an alliance of right-wing moderates, crossing the aisle of liberals and conservatives, but this desire is hardly a new one. During republican years, many parties and politicians attempted this, such as Partido del Centro Democrático of Manuel Portela Valladares, but the 1932 coup and the subsequent Catholic-dominated regime led to a decline in such attempts. Yet as the republicans flocked to the banner of the Republican government in exile, a few such individuals with similar plans stayed behind. During the Acción Popular government, a man of this mettle, Joaquín Chapaprieta y Torregrosa, did his best to forge an alliance with the Catholics and finally mend the divide between moderate republicans, both liberal and conservative.\n\nHe served as an independent member of Gil-Robles’ ‘temporary’ government aimed at restoring confidence in the regime and possibly returning to democracy. However, after it became evident that the party had no interest in restoring a form of democracy to Spain and merely wanted to continue in charge to promote the interests of Catholics and monarchists, Chapaprieta resigned from his post as an economic minister. He retired from politics upon gaining the ire of the social Catholics, and while he was not persecuted, his political career stagnated and he returned to his original profession as a lawyer. Upon the restoration of democracy and the electoral defeat of Acción Popular, he was courted by the Radicals of Alejandro Lerroux to join but declined, forming his own party in his native region of Alicante, the Partido Republicano Independiente de Alicante, which saw limited success but soon petered out due to the sheer pull of republican exile parties returning to Spain as well as the niche of his party being filled by the likes of Derecha Liberal and Partido Conservador.\n\nAs such, given the failure of his return to politics as an independent party leader, he has instead sought to ally Niceto Alcala-Zamora, the man with the most political power in Spain at the moment and one that Chapaprieta has always been close to in terms of political preferences. In fact, during the various republican crises of the 1930s, Chapaprieta had a tendency to stand behind Alcala-Zamora instead of Manuel Azaña or Alejandro Lerroux. As such, many within DLE wish that we integrate Chapaprieta’s party, increasing our support in Catalonia and bringing in conservatives of a similar mindset. Still, some within the party, such as Miguel Maura, question whether bringing in high-profile lackeys of Acción Popular into the party is such a good idea."

sprd.528.d:0 "An opportunity has arisen to weaken the powerbase of Alejandro Lerroux’s Radicals in Valencia, and the political leadership of Derecha Liberal is eager to take advantage of this momentary lapse. Sigfrido Blasco-Ibáñez, the head of the Valencian hegemonic Radical party, Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista and son of famed Valencianianist titan, Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, has recently begun to drift away from his Lerrouxist allies. Many believe that this is partly because of the many corruption scandals of the party, which have often included the name of young Sigfrido as well, it must be said, though others claim that Lerroux’s increased calls for the suppression of regionalist actors have begun to worry the leader of a very regionalist party.\n\nBlasco has always been a great admirer of the first republican president and leader of Derecha Libera, Niceto Alcala-Zamora, and has not hid his admiration even as Lerroux and Alcala-Zamora butted heads over policy and alliances over the republican years, but his more conservative turn has come out of the left field for most political observers. While majority of the PURA are still considered loyal to Lerroux, there is an increasingly dissident faction within the minor party who dislike the corruption and clientelism of Lerroux and his cronies. As such, if Derecha Liberal were to press their advantage and attempt to woo Blasco into reconsidering his loyalties, right after the electoral victory of Derecha Liberal as well, he would be likely to cave in and switch sides.\n\nMany within PURA would likely not follow, but the weight of the opinion of such an influential man in Valencia would likely cause majority of the party to follow suit. There is of course a minor possibility that it would cause the party to fall into a civil war like it did years ago when the supporters of Blasco’s father and his bitter rival Rodrigo Soriano clashed violently on the streets of Valencia over political matters, but at the moment, PURA does not possess a strong enough rival for Blasco for such an eventuality to come to pass. However, given the implication of Blasco in numerous corruption cases within Partido Radical’s service, it would require us to ensure that the man does not continue his old habits within Derecha Liberal if PURA is folded into the wider net of Derecha Liberal, a fact that is utilized by opponents of the idea of integrating PURA. The decision lays with Alcala-Zamora, though the prospect of striking Lerroux where it hurts may be too juicy to pass by."

The book details Castrillo’s experiences during the republican years, when he was part of Niceto Alcala-Zamora’s party already, the events and atrocities of the Sanjurjada coup and the authoritarian regime that followed. Castrillo attacks the various enemies of the republic with the same ruthless and scathing tone, whether its directed at the corrupt and meddlesome priests and bishops of Spain, the army officers scheming to overthrow the government that wanted to eject them from their unproductive and generationally guaranteed comfy jobs, or the social Catholics of Acción Popular, who threw all their republican ideals and accidentalism to the wind to see king Alfonso XIII restored.\n\nThe Spanish printing presses and publishing houses mostly left his book untouched, knowing that it would spark a massive reaction from the Spanish monarchist and Catholic right, but Castrillo looked beyond the borders of the nation and managed to get his tome printed overseas in Italy, contacting his liberal allies in the Republic of Lombardy-Venetia. Through his creation, Castrillo essentially vents his frustration to the public consciousness of the divided nation, opening many old wounds many republicans thought healed, and while the authorities, especially military ones, have attempted to censor the book, it has spread like wildfire. As expected, the Spanish right is fuming, and the government is truly in a pickle given Castrillo’s role within the party of Derecha Liberal. Castrillo, a classical liberal, has often chafed with the more conservative orientation that Miguel Maura and Niceto Alcala-Zamora have taken lately, and it is likely that if the controversy continues further, the former republican is kicked from the party for the sake of saving face, even if his points resonate with many within DLE."

sprd.530.d:0 "The reputation of Izquierda Española has almost always been that of an academic, left-wing bourgeois party with a very serious platform, but it would appear that recently, the party’s members are expanding the horizons more from the dusty cliques of middle-class liberals to even include children in the platform. This is especially easy to see with the founding of the children’s magazine Caperucita Roja, Periódico infantil, created by the phenomenal teacher Carmen Valero Gimeno. Valero has spent her entire professional career as a pedagogue and teacher aspiring to reform the needlessly suffocating Spanish education when it comes to teaching valuable skills to women. The Spanish schools have, before the recent reforms by IE, focused almost entirely on teaching girls skills needed to tend to homes, such as cleaning, cooking and other chores, but to Valero, the Spanish society can truly become equal only when the women and men of the nation learn the same subjects at school.\n\nThus, her most recent project, the Caperucita Roja magazine, aims to foster in a new age of critical thinking and most importantly, the yearning for learning, within the children of Spain, boys and girls alike. Alongside her outreach through the magazine, she also aims to get teachers across Spain on board with these ideas through her work in Federación Española de Trabajadores de la Enseñanza, a trade union of teachers she has founded and one that is very closely affiliated with the UGT trade union. This has meant that Valero has also become one of the most PSOE-aligned members of Izquierda Española, and some worry that she may indeed flip to join the party.\n\nHowever, Varelo herself has in the past expressed dislike for the revolutionary rhetoric and actions of PSOE’s Caballeristas and CNT-FAI’s radical wing, so it is likely she will instead seek to operate under the progressives of Azaña. Her work continues to inspire both woman teachers and young girls on the path towards more equal Spain, and she is quickly becoming one of the big names of feminism in Spain, among the likes of Clara Campoamor and Margarita Nelken, and it is hoped that the combination of Izquierda’s reforms with her innovative ideas will finally make Spain’s school leave behind the dark ages of latest centuries."

sprd.531.d:0 "The town of Almería has been embroiled in a crisis related to its mayor, Salvador Martínez Laroca, coincidentally also a politician of the Izquierda Española. Martínez was recently elected as the mayor following a bitterly contested election between the local conservative representative and the left-wing progressive alliance, but he has thus far proven to be a well-liked leader of the town given Martínez’s rather pro-worker attitude and genuine interest of the people at the forefront of his political platform. His policy of nullifying certain administrative fees for the poorest folk of the town and, given his civil profession as a doctor, he was known to provide healthcare at a minimal price and maximum quality to people of all backgrounds, going as far as to collect money from the wealthiest citizens in the region to run his well-staffed and supplied clinic. In addition to his personal work, the good doctor was also a crucial part in the founding of Velezana Social Assistance Association, which performed many of the same functions as  Martínez did, but on a much grander scale.\n\nHowever, recently Martínez has been a target of a public smearing campaign following his rather controversial decision to support the local olive growers’ strike. This campaign has been initiated by the leader of the town’s conservative clique,  Fernando Guirao Alcázar, who reigned as the mayor during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship and the period following Sanjurjada, who seeks re-election. Guirao accuses the mayor of fomenting dissent and pushing the workers against employers and property owners, which has resulted in increased social unrest in the town. Martínez has been implicated to have even provided gifts for the local unionists, which has further exasperated the local landowners, with many in their ranks claiming that the mayor is building his own left-wing caciquismo network.\n\nHowever, given that the olive growers’ striking rights are protected by the new reforms passed by the Madrid government, it is not necessarily illegal for the mayor to support the strikers, but his paralegal adventures with gifts certainly have caused a few grey hairs in the heads of prominent government officials. Nonetheless, the government could support Martínez in his struggle for legitimacy by painting his opposition as ruthless robber barons seeking to strip the local workers from their guaranteed rights, but this can obviously cause a much larger issue if landowner rights organizations decide to back the Alicantean locals in the matter. As such, it may be better to simply kick Martínez from his position and appoint a temporary mayor until new elections are held to replace him."

sprd.532.d:0 "Recent news from the town of Albacete have signaled yet another confrontation between politicians of Izquierda Española and their conservative opponents over the policies implemented by IE. The town of Albacete is a typical Spanish small town with its long-running history of liberal and conservative cliques, boosted in polarization by the difficult recent decade. The local mayor Pedro Casciaro Parodi, has been subjected to an attack by local yellow journalists over his religious practices. Casciaro himself is a member of IE and thus committed to the party’s program of secularisation, and he does not profess any particular faith but remains an agnostic. However, his wife does attend mass regularly and is rather religious, and Casciaro has a habit of attending the mass with her.\n\nThus, the local right-wingers have attacked this matter, saying that the mayor is a hypocrite and follows the political praxis of ‘Secularism, but not for my house’, a slogan that has become circulated all throughout Albacete over the last weeks. Casciaro is still very popular in the province since he has a very pro-worker mindset and tends to follow a rather liberal socialist approach to economic and social policy, and his civil profession as an historian has made him a great supporter of local arts and archeology, especially for continued excavations in the region of Hellín near Albacete, which has a very rich history and numerous important cultural sites going back to cave paintings and Roman fortress ruins. As such, the government in Madrid does not worry that these slights would cost Casciaro his seat as the mayor, but they have called IE’s program of secularisation into question.\n\nSupporters of heavy secularisation within the party have called for Casciaro to stop his habit as they see it as fraternization with the enemy, which others have noted that the party’s platform is not aiming to eradicate religion from Spain, simply move religious matters out of state affairs. Casciaro himself supports this line of thought, and has been instrumental in the preservation of cultural and religious items in the region in the wake of numerous anarchist attacks against convents and temples. As such, the government could leverage this past to strike back at Casciaro’s critics, noting that instead of going after real perpetrators of anti-clerical acts, they are attacking a man committed to peaceful and protective secularism. However, the government could also simply take the easier route and tell Casciaro to stop his religious practices, which would embolden the more anti-clerical side of IE."

sprd.533.d:0 "The party Izquierda Española has never had an official newspaper, and during the republican years, it was not thought that it would need one either. Manuel Azaña and his allies had considerable weight within the Spanish cultural and journalistic circles, and they could push the party platform through various newspapers and magazines, primarily through El Sol and La Voz, but also through probably the most influential liberal and republican paper, El Liberal. However, El Sol and La Voz had been struggling financially during the republican years, and were banned following the 1932 Sanjurjada coup, which proved to be the death blow to these two relatively famous liberal outlets. As such, when IE won the elections after Spain’s return to democracy, it had to do so through various auxiliary sources, primarily El Liberal and many smaller, less known magazines and political newspaper.\n\nThis situation was deemed unacceptable by the party elite, who were unsure as to how long they could count on support from the ever-shifting ideological leadership of El Liberal. However, one of the key members of IE and a personal friend of Azaña, Luis Bello had been planning to found a newspaper for the party itself, known as Política. Bello died in 1935 while in exile, unable to see his dream of a party newspaper come to fruition, but his work was carried to term by another member of IE’s inner circle and another close friend of Azaña, Carlos Esplá. Esplá has considerable experience in journalism and trained his skills under such liberal republican giants such as Julio Just, the Radical-Socialist ideologue Marcelino Domingo and the Valencian Radical boss Vicente Blasco Ibáñez. Already, thanks to the success of IE in elections, Política has been circulated roughly ten thousand times in the first days of its production, and the nation’s liberal left rejoices as they finally have proper representation in the press."

sprd.534.d:0 "The Second Spanish Republic was the end of the Alfonsine monarchy in Spain, but it was hardly a complete toppling of the old order, and even the staunchest republicans knew that some regions would take time to win over to the side of the republicans. With the republic’s end in 1932, it can be argued that the one region the republicans could never conquer was their undoing, for the Carlist troops from Navarra and Basque Country helped general Sanjurjo crush the republic during those faithful days. With the return to democracy and constitutional monarchism under the young king and his reluctant, if not outright hostile prime minister Azaña, the two opposing actors have found a common cause in that wayward region of Spain.\n\nWhile Azaña and the king have their own motivations to see the region’s den of reactionaries crushed, they agree that as long as the Carlists have a foothold in the area, they will continue to contest the democratic government and Alfonsine king, no matter how pitiful that resistance may be. As such, Izquierda Española has begun funding their local branch or ally party far more than in other regions of Spain, as the Partido Republicano Autónomo Navarro is perhaps the best option for progress against the deeply entrenched Carlists the democratic government has. PRAN is in many ways atypical as a member of IE’s federation of different parties, as PRAN has never officially discarded its profession of the Catholic faith, and while it advocates for secularism, it does so from a very social Christian democratic viewpoint.\n\nGiven this rather peculiar set-up of PRAN, it is thus no surprise that it may very well be best suited to contest the primordial enemies of progress, the local Carlists. After all, the Basque republicans of Partido Nacionalista Vasco have managed to create a strong, relatively stable local party by stealing more moderate voters from the Carlists with their Christian democratic outlook. As such, perhaps it is best that IE lets its regional party pursue its divergent policies to finally crush that bastion of reaction for good. PRAN has already managed to win quite a few seats within the Pamplonan city government, most importantly with Nicasio Garbayo Ayala grabbing the mayoral seat, so perhaps, bit by bit, the Carlist control over the Pyrenean regions breaks away."

sprd.535.d:0 "Izquierda Española is by definition a very big-tent party, comprising of liberals, regionalist left-wing moderates, socialists and even the occasional centrist capitalist, and thus it is no secret that the party has its fair share of factionalism. The greatest two have always been the Radical-Socialists of Marcelino Domingo and Alvaro de Albornoz, and the alliance of minor regional actors such as Partido Galeguista, Partido Autonomo Navarro and Partit Republicà d'Esquerra, primarily led by Santiago Casares Quiroga and Ramiro Gil Morel. However, as the party has seen an influx of radical republicans from various smaller parties, a new faction has begun to form under the leadership of José Antonio Balbontín, former leader of the ephemeral Partido Social Revolucionario, one of the many splinters of Spanish Radicals. During the republican years, the party ran unsuccessfully in the elections of Barcelona, and Balbontín soon abandoned the entire project following the Sanjurjada coup.\n\nDue to his relative political obscurity, he was not persecuted by the regime, but Balbontín spent these years of Acción Popular’s rule cultivating a network of like-minded republican agitators, most famously the father of Andalusian nationalism, Blas Infante, and the black sheep of the Franco family, Ramón Franco. When the Spanish Kingdom transitioned back to democratic rule, Balbontín joined Izqueirda Española, and the contacts he had formed during the dictatorship years resulted in the creation of IE’s Jabali, or Wild Boars, faction. These Wild Boars are a notably more radical group within the party, often times veering into full-blown socialist and syndicalist idealism, allying with the remaining anarchists and communists of Spain.\n\nIn fact, Balbontín himself was instrumental in the negotiations between Izquierda Española and Bloque Obreros y Campesinos, the last remaining bastion of communism in Spain, for their inclusion within the Frente Popular. However, the Jabalis continue to cause issues for the party, as their unfettered radicalism brings unwanted scrutiny upon Azaña’s party, and many within it feel as if the party is losing its liberal roots and slowly drifting into socialist ideas wholesale. As such, the party leadership must take a stance on the matter, either allowing the Jabalis to continue as a relatively minor but vocal part of the party, or to censor Balbontín’s radicals to safeguard IE’s identity from further drift leftwards."

Ciges started his journey in the army, losing his faith in the military following the war in Cuba, a lapse in faith that eventually led him to attack the military establishment and entire war on the island, almost leading to a death sentence after it was discovered that Ciges had tried to send a large document with his collected grievances to French news agency.\n\nCiges would turn to a career in literature, writing multiple books about his experiences in Cuba and in the prisons of the island he was incarcerated in. He moved from autobiographical works to more detailed descriptions of the daily lives of Spain’s regular denizens during the 1910s and 20s, earning much ire from the political establishment he often criticized as the cause of the situation for much of Spain’s regular folk. It is no surprise that a man of such interest in the lives of ordinary folk and such hatred for the monarchy and complacency that its allies brought would turn to republicanism, though his personal friendship with Manuel Azaña certainly helped.\n\nDuring the republican years, Ciges would join Azaña’s republican party and become an important member of its organization, and currently, he works as the civil governor of the Balearics, known for his combative stances towards piracy and smuggling, which has earned him much ire from the famed pirate-capitalist Juan March, the kingpin of Mallorca. Ciges continues his literature work to this day, and his sharp word still cuts against the enemies of Izquierda Española, though these days he mainly writes for Política, IE’s party paper. His efforts to rejuvenate the ideas of Joaquin Costa to fit the more progressive modern republicanism have also been notable, even if Ciges has his fair share of criticism for Costa’s authoritarian ways as well."

sprd.537.d:0 "The Spanish province of Galicia has always struggled to attract much political left-wing traction over the years, given the rural and rather primitive state of it. While it houses a degree of smaller regionalist parties of liberal and social democratic nature, such as the big-tent Partido Galeguista, these parties are hardly the brightest examples of left-wing progressivism and do often have a rather substantial conservative wing as well. However, it would appear that Izquierda Española is finally making inroads into capturing the hearts and minds of the Galicians, first with the integration of ORGA, the local federalist party, into IE, and now, thanks to the efforts of one IE politician, the cultural scene of the region is becoming more receptive to the party’s ideas. Francisco Lamas López, a native of Lugo, has always been a passionate fan of Galician cultural heritage, starting with the works of the Galician literary icon Rosalía de Castro from a very young age and progressing to other authors of the Galician Rexurdimento, a period of cultural growth and linguistic development hailed as the Golden age of Galicianism by some.\n\nLamas has organized the Galician intelligentsia and literature scene since the beginning of the republican era, and his greatest work was probably the founding of Ateneo Popular de Lugo, which aimed to break from the bureaucratic ways of its rival, Círculo de las Artes, which Lamas considered little more than an institutionalized and sterile entity. He quickly created a circle of friends and associates with whom Lamas cultivated multiple artistic and journalistic projects, with big names of Galician cultural scene such as writer and theatre director Ánxel Fole and the republican poet Lorenzo Varela, though many of these projects were never able to reach their full potential given the military coup of 1932 and the following attacks on republican institutions, organizations and cultural groups.\n\nHowever, Lamas has returned to the scene en force, backed by Izquierda Española once more, and his recent project with Fole is the newspaper Yunque, a first truly left-wing paper in Galicia, first opened in 1931 but now resurrected with newfound energy. Lamas has been a staunch voice for the Galician unity with Spain but also maintains his fascination with local culture and literature, which has earned him quite a bit of support in the region in a way the party has previously been unable to do without using proxies such as ORGA. It would appear that if Yunque truly succeeds in its aim to create a movement for IE in Galicia, the province may very well have a bright and progressive future in front of it, all thanks to Francisco Lamas."

sprd.538.d:0 "Recently, Izquierda Española has been reinforced with yet another key republican era leader thanks to the tireless work of Álvaro de Albornoz, a former leader of Partido Republicano Radical Socialista Independiente​. De Albornoz facilitated the entry of Victoria Kent into the party, where previously she had withdrawn from politics. Kent is a controversial yet equally popular figure in Spanish politics, mostly down to her role in the women’s suffrage debate in 1932, where she clashed with another prominent liberal feminist, Clara Campoamor. Campoamor represented the pro-suffrage side of the debate, while Kent opposed it, with her main argument being that Spain was not ready for the time that women would be allowed to vote. Kent based this argument on the fact that much of Spain’s womenfolk were of extremely pious and devout nature, and would follow whatever orders the clergy diverted their way, either implicitly or suggestively, when it came to political matters.\n\nKent would ultimately suffer defeat with Campoamor side being the far more popular one during the progressive republican years, but history does not tell whether her assessment was correct, as the military coup of 1932 cut any such reforms short. However, the following Gil-Robles’ social Catholic government did allow women to vote and participate as candidates in municipal elections, and this would see a massive upsurge in political support for right-wing parties, so perhaps Kent’s opposition was not too far-fetched. Her work as a legal advisor or outright lawyer for various worker-dominated groups, such as Confederación Nacional de Pósitos Marítimos and Sindicato Nacional Ferroviario, has made her popular with the working class, something which IE hopes to leverage, though she is a common target for right-wing media not only because of her left-wing views but also because of her rumoured preference of the fairer sex as romantic companions.\n\nHowever, her status and prestige among former republicans is the reason de Albornoz was so keen to have Kent join IE, as the woman lawyer made a name for herself defending de Albornoz against the military tribunal when the Radical-Socialist was accused of conspiracy against the monarchy, a feat that made her the first woman to appear in front of such tribunal and which led to de Albornoz’s acquittal. Kent was hesitant to join the party at first, but given that she was promised an important post as the head of General Directorate of Prisons, a post she briefly held before the coup, as a sort of chance to finish what Kent had started nearly half a decade ago, she agreed and joined the new republican party for good. This victory is not only significant in terms of getting a new, capable politician to join, but also because of Kent’s connections to the feminist movements of Spain, especially Lyceum Club Femenino and Asociación Nacional de Mujeres Españolas."

The Casa del Pueblo are a network of PSOE headquarters scattered all throughout Spain from which the party operates. With the first ones constructed just at the crack of the century, first in Montijo in 1901 and another shortly after in Alcira, the network would go on to reach all corners of Spain from Madrid to Vizcaya and Andalusia. The Houses serve a multitude of purposes going beyond just simple party administration, and they are often equally owned by local socialist unions.\n\nCasa del Pueblo are used to combat the ever-present illiteracy among workers, with skilled teachers and other workers to guide their less-fortunate companions to learn the important skills of writing and reading, and once these workers are caught up to speed, they can join other classes discussing socialism, unionism, culture and various educational topics. The Houses also serve as places of gathering for various seemingly non-ideological purposes, as many have their own choirs, sports, theatre or arts groups, cooperative shops and coffee venues. They also provide free services to the local workers in the form of a primitive but effective medication banks and of course, libraries, with the largest Casa del Pueblo library in Madrid housing over three thousand books. While it may appear that PSOE and UGT dominate these houses ideologically, their share of ownership of the various locations of the Houses in Spain only reaches up to around fifteen percent, and many house even non-socialist unionists or people from the rival unions of CNT and ALE.\n\nNonetheless, the role of unions in financing these Casas del Pueblo remains massive, and this has been something of a thorn in the side of prime minister Julián Besteiro given that the UGT was for long controlled by his rival Largo Caballero. However, as the political scene of Spain has moderated itself, tensions within the Houses have also dissipated, and they can continue to fulfill their primary function, the crucial availability of much needed services for the oppressed and neglected workers of Spain."

Besteiro’s utter denouncement of revolutionary action and at times stubborn denial of working with the other republican groups made him something of an outcast within the party, and few expected him to raise to the position of PSOE’s president. And yet, through the work of Trifón Gómez San José, Besteiro came to overcome his previous non-collaborative stances and now stands at the utmost leader of Spain’s socialists. Throughout his difficult path, however, he has always had the support of Andrés Saborit Colomer, who echoes Besteiro’s ideals to the letter. Saborit has been the staunchest ally of Besteiro over the years, and his experience in the field of journalism, with Saborit running the newspapers Tiempos Nuevos and Democracia, have made him the propaganda arm of the Besteiristas as they have challenged their revolutionary counterparts time and time again on the press.\n\nSaborit started working at the ripe age of eight, becoming a life-long man of the printing press as he advanced through the ranks of Asociación General del Arte de Imprimir and Federación Gráfica Española, and his activism after getting involved in non-union politics would land him a few sentences and jail visits. However, Saborit would ride the wave of political activism high and collaborate with the father of Spanish socialism, Pablo Iglesias Posse, in various publishing-related ventures, coming to succeed this venerable figure once he became the leader of the socialist publishing house La Gráfica. His extreme love for political activism combined with the life-long collection of knowledge related to the art of political papers transformed La Gráfica under his rule into the bastion of socialist grassroots literature, with products of the publishing house reaching all corners of Spain.\n\nAs such, while Besteiro has never possessed the opportunistic populism of his rival Largo Caballero and his moderate, even at times conservatively socialist stances, have never appealed as much to Spanish workers as Caballero’s calls for revolution, Besteiro’s ace up his sleeve has always been the close friendship to Saborit, the man behind Spain’s most effective socialist mouthpiece. Without Saborit’s efforts at convincing the Spanish worker to resist their revolutionary impulses, Spain may have seen a whole another trajectory, but thanks to Besteiro’s most loyal ally, the nation sees only prosperity ahead itself."

sprd.541.d:0 "The Spanish military is hardly the harbinger of progress in Spain, and this is arguably even more true now that the purges of José Sanjurjo have made the few socialist and liberal officers leave the military one after another. While many are now returning as democracy returns, some choose not to, leaving behind the conservative, if not outright reactionary atmosphere to pursue new avenues in their lives. This has led to an influx of soldiers into various new democratic parties, and while PSOE has not been the party with most support from ex-military men, it has nonetheless seen its ranks bolstered by officers nonetheless. One of the most important new arrivals is Julio Mandaga Rosenörn, a former colonel who has repeatedly had to face disappointments during his career due to Mandaga’s sympathies towards the proletariat. During the long years of exile, he helped train PSOE’s militants in preparation for a republican restoration, and for this he was granted the title ‘The People’s General’, despite his much lower rank.\n\nMandaga would often clash with his supervisors over their loyalties, and he particularly persecuted after he publicly denounced the anti-republican rhetoric of the likes of Manuel Goded Llopis. After Sanjurjada, Mandaga wisely left Spain, finding refuge in his birthplace of Cuba, where he was supported by a local Esperantist organization, and now he has returned to Spain to pursue a life in politics. Mangada was convinced to join PSOE by a fellow Esperantists Cayetano Redondo and Francisco Azorín, who are both supporters of the party, though Mangada retains good relations to other Esperantists especially among CNT-FAI, such as Rosa Laviña and Eduardo Vivancos, as well as communist Esperantists such as Ramon Arteu.\n\nMangdada has been interested in artificial languages since his childhood, as his father spoke Volapük with his officer comrades, and now the colonel possesses a great deal of political clout among the Spanish Esperanto speakers as the co-founder of Hispana Esperanto-Asocio, one of the key organizations of the language in Iberia, and his role as the publisher of Hispana Esperanto-Gazeto certainly does not weaken his importance in the community. Mangada’s reputation as a man of the people and an enthusiastic, if also particularly eccentric, socialist in addition to his honourable military career have made him a rising star within PSOE, and his relatively moderate outlook on socialist policy has opened him further positions amongst the Besteirista inner circle. It is hoped that Mangada can help further establish ties to the anarchists and communists through his Esperanto connections, as well as helping PSOE gain a foothold among the armed forces."

sprd.542.t:0 "Maria de la O and the New Socialist Woman"
sprd.542.d:0 "The stance of PSOE towards feminism has always been relatively aloof, with the party focusing instead mainly on achieving a socialist society first. This according to many party politicians would then achieve the abolishment of gender differences, though there are also those within the party’s ranks who think that these differences are not for socialism to fix as they are natural part of the society. Historically, many feminist big names such as Clara Campoamor and Victoria Kent, who would have otherwise sympathized with the party, have turned to other venues of political activity after finding out about the party’s stance on women’s rights. Nonetheless, even if the party’s mainstream remains relatively uninterested in the struggle for women’s voice to be heard, there are still those within it who do support the full emancipation of women.\n\nPerhaps the strongest voice has been Maria de la O Lejárraga, who has recently reopened her organization, Asociación Femenina de Educación Cívica after it was closed following the 1932 coup. Lejárraga has been an important member of the Spanish feminist circles for decades, and her work on dispelling negative expectations and misinformation regarding the republic in 1931 through a five-part conference aimed for women was crucial in gaining more support for republican parties in those important years. Now, with the reopening of AFEC, Lejárraga aims to create an apolitical, or more accurately, non-partisan, space for women from all walks of life, especially with those who seek no political party or union activity but still wish to advance the rights for women. AFEC however is no mere activist platform, but works as a cradle of women’s culture, drawing from the immense well of Spanish talent willing to help with such project, with names such as the writer and feminist giant María de Maeztu, Isabel de Palencia and the director of Mundo Femenino, Julia Peguero Sanz.\n\nMany within the organization’s supporters do come from the more liberal-minded group of feminists, Asociación Nacional de Mujeres Españolas, but a fair deal are also more socialist-leaning supporters of Lejárraga. The success of AFEC has not gone unnoticed by the leadership of PSOE, and while many still dismiss their activity as little more than women’s politicking, others see an opportunity to create a more moderate women’s movement within PSOE to contrast the one dominated by the ally of Largo Caballero’s revolutionary socialists, PSOE’s own radical firebrand Margarita Nelken. Lejárraga had tried to create an organization for socialist women all the way back in the 1920s, known as Unión de Mujeres de España, but the project dried up, thanks to no small part because of a lack of support from other socialist organizations. If PSOE’s current leadership was to encourage Lejárraga to pursue a rekindling of this old project of hers, it could very well allow for a more moderate approach to socialist feminism in contrast to Nelken’s revolutionary rhetoric."

sprd.543.t:0 "The Madrid Assassinations"
sprd.543.d:0 "All of Madrid shook earlier this week when an attack against a government official was carried out in broad daylight, stirring Spain from the peaceful slumber it had managed to attain after the crisis of 1936 was overcome. The perfidious reactionaries of Guerilleros de España attacked the PSOE politician and diplomat Luis Jiménez de Asúa as he was leaving the embassy of Poland, striking Jiménez with two bullets and also hitting the man who had been with the politician, Jesús Gisbert, killing Gisbert instantly on the sidewalk while Jiménez lost consciousness. The cowardly gunmen tried to flee the scene as a passers-by alerted the police, but the following shootout with Guardia Civil led to the death of one assailant while the other assassin managed to escape. Guardia Civil was thankfully spared of losses, and Jiménez was rushed to a nearby hospital where the staff managed to spare his life.\n\nWhile the identity of the attackers remains unknown, the notorious right-wing paramilitary group led by Juan de Ansaldo, known as Guerilleros de España, has claimed the attack as their own. According to them, it was a strike against the encroaching order of socialist tyrants, revolutionary radicals and Judeo-Masonic traitors to Spain. De Ansaldo is currently hiding in Portugal, but his followers, while few in numbers, continue to pester Spain with their presence. Unfortunately, the tragedy of the attack does not end ín this singular strike, as possibly as a means of covering up their tracks, the Guerilleros attacked magistrate Manuel Pedregal Luege on Paseo de Luchana, killing him in a similar hit-and-run assassination.\n\nThis time, Guardia Civil was too late to stop the thugs from finishing their target. Pedregal was not a member of any party or political organization, but he had been assigned to investigate the attack on Jiménez and this was all the reason the fanatics of de Ansaldo needed. The government of PSOE has followed these attacks with an escalation of anti-paramilitary suppression campaign, with many prominent members of the Corpo de Vigilancia and Guardia Civil called in for questioning out of fear for reactionary infiltration within these organizations, though the party has its hands tied for the most part as pushing too hard could be seen as revolutionary behaviour."

sprd.544.t:0 "The Red Star Rises Over Catholic Spain"
sprd.544.d:0 "Until now, PSOE’s official position on the Catholic church and secularism has been relatively ambivalent, as the party under Besteiro has attempted to install a more moderate current to the party’s politics. However, recently the party has adopted a slow program of secularisation and decoupling of Spain from the Catholic church, but this process, overseen by the staunch defender of freedom within PSOE, Fernando de los Ríos, appears to be far less hostile to the church than the likes planned by Unión Española and Izquierda Española. As a minister of Education, de los Ríos has attempted to promote new ways of education to slowly phase off Catholic schools, but he has also intervened in the various fierce debates on secularism, defending the church on the grounds that despite its many encroachments into spaces that belong to a civilian government, the religious institution does provide an immense amount of social, medical and cultural aid to the Spanish society.\n\nAs such, de los Ríos has tries to dispel the anti-clerical attitudes of many within the wider socialist movement, promoting a more collaborative stance instead. This has been a relatively surprising attitude from the minister, given that he has been atheist for decades now, but those that know the man are not particularly surprised. While de los Ríos has never been the most ardent supporter of Julían Besteiro, he has always belonged to the moderate wing of the party, and despite his atheism, he possesses a great degree of spirituality in other ways and ha shown great support for religious organizations of all shapes and sizes in the past.\n\nAs such, while the eventual aims of PSOE’s secularism are likely to remain similar to those of the more liberal parties like UE and IE, the actual pursuit of secularization is less offensive towards the church than Manuel Azaña’s fiery rhetoric has been. It is hoped that by adopting de los Ríos’ ideas on secularisation, the party can prevent hostile Catholic parties such as Partido Nacionalista Español from exploiting those fearful or disgruntled faithful for votes, in a similar vein to the rhetoric adopted by Acción Popular in the aftermath of the Sanjurjada coup to justify their authoritarian rule, though whether the more moderate approach will work or not remains to be seen."

sprd.545.d:0 "With the normalisation of Spanish culture and return to democracy, PSOE as a party has felt comfortable pursuing its extensive education reforms, that were planned during republican years but never pushed into fruition. Fernando de los Ríos, the minister of Education, has always been a strong admirer of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, a long-running Spanish institute of pedagogy and educational reform inspired by the ideas of Karl Friedrich Krause and originally founded by de los Ríos’ uncle Francisco Giner de los Ríos. De los Ríos has been adopting the ideas of ILE into action for the better part of his ministerial career, and he has mixed in some ideas from the French Marxist pedagogical idealist Célestin Freinet, with the minister hoping to get the first educational institutions modelled after ILE’s developments underway before the end of PSOE’s term.\n\nHowever, de los Ríos has always been a strong supporter of culture, and Spain is full of artists sympathetic to the party’s cause and the education ministry’s plans to educate Spain, so a republican era project has been resurrected in a collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the famous poet, writer and theatre director Federico García Lorca. This collaboration has borne fruit in the revival of La Barraca, a plan for a theatre troupe that would have been used during the republican years to spread culture and educational theatre to the most remote and forgotten parts of Spain. Back then, its primary aim was to agitate for the republican cause, but now La Barraca will drive forward the ideals of PSOE and Spanish socialism as a whole.\n\nEduardo Ugarte and Federico García Lorca will lead the troupe throughout Spain, with a program made up of both traditional Spanish theatre plays and new ones devised by members of the group, with much of the art needed in the props and promotional material devised by avant-garde artists of Spain, such as José Caballero and curiously, Alfonso Ponce de León, who despite his known sympathies to the National Syndicalist JONS party has helped with the production out of shared love for art. The troupe has a mix of big-name actors and less famous newcomers, and even employs the sister of Federico García, Isabel García Lorca. The true length of their journey is still only in the planning phase, but the most ambitious estimates suggest that there may even be close to a hundred destinations on their journey. With roughly thirteen plays planned for the troupe, they will surely gain quite a bit of experience while travelling, and it is hoped that this new burst of Spanish culture will revitalize theatrical life on Spain’s countryside, encouraging even the most backwater places in Spain to embrace the cultural life and theatrical flair once more."

sprd.546.t:0 "Communist Collapse in Asturias"
sprd.546.d:0 "The success of socialism in Spain has been clear ever since PSOE’s electoral victory in last elections, but same cannot be said for its sister ideology communism in the peninsula. After the French Revolution in the late 1910s and the failure of Russian communism the Spanish communist parties, Partido Comunista Español and Partido Comunista Obrero Español, were planning a merger but these plans fell apart when many of their members rejoined PSOE or abandoned the ideals of Marxism altogether to go join syndicalist organizations instead. PCE would cease to exist while PCOE continued an ephemeral existence in Asturias, kept alive by PSOE-minded but still very independent communists such as Oscar Perez Solis and Isidoro Rodríguez Acevedo, with the 1934 miner’s strike causing many within the party to flee the nation, if they were lucky, or to lose their lives at the hands of the Spanish military. However, PCOE has returned somewhat from those dark days and continues as a very regional force of socialism, close to how another communist party, Bloque Obrero y Campesino was before its abandonment of Catalanism was.\n\nHowever, recently the party has run into a crisis of leadership as its long-time leader and founder Oscar Perez Solis has flipped in his support, going to join the Totalist party JONS after being inspired by the Totalist Charter. The party has always remained a strong opponent of JONS and even demanded its removal from the left-wing alliance aimed at toppling the kingdom in 1936. It is believed that José Gafo Muñiz, a far-right unionist and priest who has been linked with an alliance of Catholic unions and the Carlist para-military group masquerading as an union, Sindicatos Libres, was partially to blame for this sudden change of heart, as Perez spent considerable time in prison in 1934 and was possibly influenced by Gafo to adopt Catholicism as his personal faith. Now, PCOE struggles to maintain a front of unity, with supporters of Perez flipping to JONS while Isidoro Rodríguez, another founder of PCOE, tries to keep his ship afloat amidst the upheaval.\n\nIgnalecio Prieto, one of the leaders of PSOE, has suggested that the government steps in and offers PCOE a spot in the government to avoid their total collapse and giving legitimacy to Rodríguez’s loyalists at the expense of JONS, and the communist-sympathizers within PSOE such as Largo Caballero and Santiago Carrillo have backed up Prieto in a rare collaboration between the two factions. However, the moderate leadership of Besteiro and his allies finds any collaboration with the communists disgraceful, with many still remembering the horrors of the Russian civil war and the repression of non-communist forms of socialism that happened within the Bolshevik camp. PCOE has shown few such tendencies but the wounds still run deep within PSOE’s common consciousness, and thus it is likely that Besteiro would personally shoot any such suggestions down.\n\nHowever, outright integration of PCOE is also possible, and would lead to fewer outright issues as it would require PCOE members to tone down their ideological fervour while bolstering the ranks of PSOE, though again they may simply reinforce Caballero’s revolutionary socialist camp. Still, even though Besteiro himself may oppose collaboration, even he must admit that if the party collapses, its members may join more radical groups such as Izquierda Comunista Española, a fringe group of Spanish Trotskyists and other left-communist idealists."

sprd.547.d:0 "The make-up of Acción Popular may at first glance appear to be relatively rigid, with most of its members supporting relatively authoritarian approach to governance, social Catholic economic values, distaste for secularism and support for the retaining of agrarian property rights, but like most parties, it has its factions nonetheless. One of these factions, however, has recently broken off to pursue its own agenda, allying with the firebrand nationalists of Partido Nacionalista Español. Led by Ramón Serrano Suñer, a known troublemaker who long agitated for a more violent and aggressive use of the AP’s youth organisation, Juventudes de Acción Popular, the new faction has gone on to split the regional section of Aragon, Unión de Derechas de Zaragoza off from the main party, to instead join PNE in coalition. Serrano Suñer is joined by other rebels within the party, such as the Germanophile Count of Mayade, José Finat y Escrivá de Romaní and another dissident Fermín Daza, who together with numerous less prominent politicians have denounced the democratic line of AP as degeneration of Spain.\n\nThe group takes a great deal of ideas from the German young Revolutionary Conservatives, claiming that only through strong leadership and revolutionary return to traditional values of Spain reforged with new spirit and idealism of modern era. While the leadership of AP has denounced such splitters, few within the party actually expect the insubordinate trio to make it far on their own, as their ideas are very similar to those already pursued by Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, a small Castilian party run by Onésimo Redondo Ortega, which, despite its great ambition, remains a fringe actor in national politics, only making headlines when members of Redondo’s group of thugs bashes some poor socialist’s head in or gets the same treatment in return.\n\nNonetheless, with the backing of PNE, they may stand a bit bigger of a chance at succeeding than the JCAH, though whether this is the case or not remains to be seen. The Aragonese political scene is fairly split between Catalanist-inspired regionalists, members of the Radical Partido Republicano Autónomo de Aragón and various anarchist movements, so UDZ will have its fair share of work ahead if it wishes to truly establish itself as a party, further making them little more than a nuisance to the wider network of Acción Popular. The local leader of Acción Popular in Zaragoza, the honourable professor of law Gil Gil y Gil has ensured the Madrid government that he is willing to go as far as to ally PRAA in order to dislodge UDZ from its position, though he is confident that such drastic measures are unlikely to be needed."

sprd.548.d:0 "Recently, a member of Acción Popular, José María Fernández-Ladreda has made the headlines after he requested the restoration of a title that belonged to his family, this being the Count of San Pedro, and the Spanish crowd, pleased with his stellar service has awarded the military leader his title. This is hardly surprising news, as during his service within AP, he has been one of the staunchest supporters of the monarchy in Spain and openly denounced some ideas members of the party had during republican years about adopting a more accidentalist position. Under Fernández-Ladreda’s direction, the branch of AP in Asturias, Unión Católica Asturiana, grew to be an tumour of monarchism within the body of the republic, resisting the new system seemingly to the bitter end as left-wing support within the support grew exponentially, but with the arrival of Sanjurjada, UCA was saved and became a stronghold for the new kingdom.\n\nHowever, this would backfire with the 1934 Asturias rising, as many UCA politicians were slain in political reprisals by the disgruntled workers, and the entire region became incredibly polarized afterwards as Fernández-Ladreda led very harsh punishments towards the insurgents, backed by the army thanks to his military connections. His restoration to the status of count was not only because of his political loyalties, however, as Fernández-Ladreda has had a rather long military career as well, fighting in Melilla during the conflict against Rifian tribesmen in 1910s and going on to become one of the key researchers dedicated to explosives, communications devices and gas warfare in Spain.\n\nFernández-Ladreda studied in the United States before returning to Spain n the 1920s, and in Spain he would become a part of research efforts to improve Spanish artillery, rising quickly through the ranks of the military and academic life with his promotion to commander and acquiring of a doctorate in the turn of the decade to 1930s. Within the ranks of AP, he has always been a strong fighter against the Germanophile section, not necessarily out of hatred for the Germans but because of his strong Catholic convictions. Many members of the left-wing parties have protested his new noble title, given the atrocities committed in Asturias during the rising, but the monarchy has turned a deaf ear on their pleas for the time being."

After the death of the republic, Pérez left his initial party, citing that the collapse of the dysfunctional, far too polarizing and near revolutionary republic had left a sour taste in his mouth, and that from now on, he would be committed to ‘the love of the Fatherland, respect for the history of Spain and the fervent duty to strengthen and guarantee the development of Spanish society’, as he himself put it. Under AP, he was initially distrusted, but his fervent Catholic faith and venomous words aimed at the republicans soon landed him a spot on the new Spanish national radio network Radio Nacional de España, created by the military following the coup but utilized far more by the ruling government of Acción Popular.\n\nWorking for RNE, Pérez would run the famous shows El miliciano Remigio and La Flota Republicana, constantly attacking the various pro-republican militias that had remained in Spain to continue the fight against the military, while La Flota would lambast the state of the Spanish fleet, calling it a hive of reds which, if left unpurged, would result in every vessel being overtaken by the socialists and syndicalists in a case of an uprising. He would also attack the militiamen as men driven by their passions more than sense, unworthy bottom of the barrel of human society who would only go and spread infectious diseases in addition to their ideological degradation of Spanish minds, even going so far as to say that the militiamen were incapable of speaking in anything but grammatically weak and vulgar patterns of speech.\n\nAfter Spain’s return to democratic rule, Pérez has become something of a target to his former republican allies, and his show has been cancelled until further notice, especially given that AP no longer holds absolute power over the national radio. As such, Pérez has entered the ranks of AP’s politicians, and his religious fundamentalism places him strictly to the right-wing flank of the new democratic party apparatus of AP, though whether the man has what it takes as a rank-and-file politician remains to be seen."

A Sevillan industrialist from a powerful local family and important exporter tycoon of olives, Alcalá y Henke was set to have a luxurious life from his birth, and despite his family’s already immense wealth, he set on to multiply it further, becoming a strong part of the Sevillan and Andalusian olive growers’ trade and his company, García, Alcalá y Cía, was one of the key sellers of Andalusian canned vegetables and olives in the United States, though his finances have since suffered slightly because of the crisis in the Americas. His wealth has not blinded him to the social ills of the local population, however, and he has become the beacon of social Catholicism in the region in both daily life and politics, becoming known as a ‘father of the poor’ in local circles due to his generous displays of charity, and after he won a seat as a representative of his hometown Alcalá de Guadaíra, he has been committed to improving the lives of the town’s poorest inhabitants, as well as travelling to Madrid multiple times since his electoral victory to resolve issues with the baking industry of Sevilla directly.\n\nAlcalá y Henke represents the left-most flank of his party, aligning with the Christian democratic wing promoted by the Valencian moderate Luis Lucia Lucia and the utopian conservative Manuel Giménez Fernández. His popularity in the region has been near unquestionable, as the electoral victory of the politician was so overwhelming that the more left-wing candidates could barely scrape enough votes to even reach double digits, which goes to show that Alcalá y Henke’s approach to social Catholicism is a paragon for all of Spain to follow. However, given his aversion to the more authoritarian ideals of AP, Alcalá y Henke is also one of the candidates most likely to flip to a new party should one appear to be far more moderate than AP while still holding the Catholic and moderate conservative values, a fear that is also applied to his Christian democrat allies."

Instead of relying on the support of military in cases of trouble, Acción Popular seeks to create a federation of non-violent organizations aimed at guiding public life and the citizens of Spain towards more beneficial aims than political agitation and revolutionary actions. Big part of this program is of course the construction of a better economy and various social assistance groups, but there must also be Catholic groups in education to avoid the academia from becoming a cesspit for traitors to rise from, driven by insurgent ideas of socialism, syndicalism and anarchism.\n\nTo this aim, the party has contacted the leadership the students union Confederación Nacional de Estudiantes Católicos, originally organized by the capable Ministry of Economy Federico Salmón, to ensure that CNEC is loyal to the regime and approves these measures. The aims of CNEC is to foster in  a new era of Catholic education, combating the liberal sympathies of the professors and the socialist ideas of Spain’s youth. CNEC will draw most of its support from sympathetic organizations such as the Catholic political lay organisations Asociación Católica de Propagandistas and Acción Católica, with the hope of propagating social Catholicism as a third way between the hardline conservatism of Spain’s far-right monarchists and the socialist and liberal ideals of Spanish left.\n\nCNEC will allow future politicians of AP to gain experience in the field of university politics as well, and it will also help combat the rise of Carlist student organisations such as the blasted Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista, a certified hive of traditionalist radicalisation in Spain. CNEC has of course existed for quite some time in Spain, but with the new support and ample funding from the government, very much pushed by minister Salmón, the movement can grow beyond its humble origins to truly envelop the many universities of Spain.

Benito Pabón defended many anarchists accused of serious crimes during the social upheavals of 1936, sometimes successfully but more often than not, without much support from the courts, and he also extended his aid to the communists of Bloque Obrero y Campesino after their members were caught as parts of the riots in Barcelona. Jesús Pabón has thus far made a rather successful career as historian and politician of Acción Popular, and he has also dabbled in journalism thanks to his friend José Antonio Giménez-Arnau, who acted as the head of the national press during AP’s dictatorship, though after the return to democracy and installation of more politically neutral candidates to the press offices, Pabón has mostly abandoned these pursuits.\n\nWith these recent activities of his brother, the Pabóns have become targets of multiple attacks from other branches of AP and especially more right-wing Spanish parties such as Partido Nacionalista and Renovación Española, with many claiming that the Pabóns are in league with the anarchists and seek to infiltrate the ruling party from the inside. However, Jesús Pabón has openly denounced the activities of his brother and claimed that they are actions of a reckless individual dabbling in matters best left for the patriotic institutions of Spain. Nonetheless, given the resurgence of partisan yellow journalism following the democratization of Spain, numerous left-wing outlets have also given their mocking support to Jesús Pabón, hoping to stir the internal party politics of AP to a breaking point over a seemingly minor issue.

However, throughout the party’s lifetime, and especially following the influx of new members after the Sarjurjada coup, there have been those who have used the party to pursue violent actions against their perceived enemies on the left, be they liberal or socialist in nature. One such man is Ramón Ruiz Alonso, a typographer and politician of the AP, first saved into the ranks of the party from the national-syndicalist organization JONS in 1931 thanks to the intervention of José María Gil-Robles, a life-long friend of Ruiz. Thanks to the help of Gil-Robles’ mentor, Ángel Herrera Oria, Ruiz was also able to forge a career in press, working for the newspaper Ideal.\n\nHowever, it would appear that Ruiz was beyond salvation even with these auspicious interventions, as he was caught in controversy already in 1935 as he tried to arrest, and presumably assassinate, the beloved republican poet Federico García Lorca, but he was thwarted in this action by other members of AP, who considered such an action foolhardy and reckless, one that would hand the republicans a powerful martyr on a silver platter. Given that García Lorca was friends with numerous right-wing artists and intellectuals, and did not show signs of actually organizing militant resistance to the right-wing government, he had been deemed unimportant by the government and left alone until Ruiz attempted his stunt. After this failure, Ruiz seemed to learn little, as after the return to democracy, Ruiz has been one of the strongest voices crying out for this decision to be overturned, his clear authoritarianism showing.\n\nHis hatred for left-wing parties and democracy was most notable in another recent scandal of his, where Ruiz got into a fistfight with a member of Unión Republicana, Félix Gordón Ordás, whom he attacked out of the blue on the corridor of the Cortes of all places. This episode led to the opposition claiming that AP cannot be allowed to govern as long as such brutes are allowed to remain in its ranks, calling the government to expel Ruiz from its ranks right away. However, despite his failings as a politician and his lack of temper in even the basest of level, Ruiz holds a degree of support thanks to his important position in the worker’s section of AP, the Acción Obrerista wing of the party, though the leaders of Acción Obrerista, Dimas de Madariaga y Almendros and José Ramón Otero Pumares, are showing less and less patience for the antics of Ruiz and even his old friend Gil-Robles, leader of AP, has shown signs of growing tired of the man."

sprd.554.t:0 "The Rebranding of Catholic Unions"
sprd.554.d:0 "Christian unionism in Spain has always been something of a slowly growing trend, with the Carlist’s Sindicatos Libres and the Basque Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna being perhaps the best examples of what the Catholic worker’s movement can achieve in Spain. However, within Acción Popular, there is a small but influential movement of these Catholic unionists, growing by the day now that AP has accepted democracy once more and engages more in social Catholicism than during its authoritarian rule. This section, known as Acción Obrerista, grew out of a party of the same name, led by Dimas de Madariaga y Almendros and José Ramón Otero Pumares, who have long wanted to put the theories of social Catholicism into action among the workers.\n\nHowever, their attempts during the latest dictatorship of AP were unsuccessful, as many viewed Acción Obrerista as little more than a tool for the bosses to control unionism in Spain. The members of AO originally met in 1931, with de Madariaga and José Ramón being accompanied by Rafael Sanz del Diego, with this meeting resulting in the founding of the party and its sister union, Coalición Española de Trabajadores. With the rise of AP during the republican years, AO would come to join the party, and agitated greatly during the years leading up to the crisis of 1936, when the laborers of AO would be crucial in negotiating with the socialist unions as workers to one another. However, the perception of AO and CET has been relatively bad even to this day, and the movement is struggling on despite attempts to reform it into a more functional and attractive state. The perception of Catholic unionists as little more than yellow syndicalists is not easy to shake, and memories of the Sindicatos Libres unionists breaking strikes and performing street brawls with the anarchists during the years of the pistolerismo is not something that really enhances CET’s prospects in attracting the workers.\n\nSome have suggested that the best course forward would thus be to rebrand the movement with a new name. There has also been suggestions to dislodge AO and CET from AP’s control, to allow the movement to grow on its own and make it less susceptible to being perceived as a mere tool for the government. One of the new suggested names, Hermandades del Trabajo, is supported by José Ramón, while de Madariaga supports the name Confederación Española de Sindicatos Obreros. Whichever name is picked, it’s clear that the Catholic unionist movement may very well have experienced a major shift, as it tries its hardest to distance from the AO in public perception, though some fear that they may also do so politically."

sprd.555.t:0 "The Exodus From Izquierda Española"
sprd.555.d:0 "The political party Izquierda Española has for a long time tried to balance the interests of its more liberal-minded members and the more radical and even at times socialist members. Naturally, this has led to a lot of dissidence within the party, and as IE has grown, the most left-wing flank of the party, the so called Wild Boars or Los Jabalíes, has also experience drastic expansion. The Jabalíes are mostly made up of various Radical-Socialists, radical progressives and even syndicalists who do not particularly like the direction of CNT-FAI or UGT. They are best characterized by their youthful agitation and calls for a more decisive action against the many enemies of IE, with many of their members being less experienced politicians or orators.\n\nPerhaps the most uniting characteristic of the group is their strict adherence to federalism, usually in very decentralized or even borderline anarchist form, with some such as Ángel Samblancat being outright anarcho-syndicalists in orientation. However, while these men are very much demagogic agitators, they are not necessarily anti-democratic, and with the increased moderation of IE and PSOE, Partido Sindicalista has become an attractive destination for many Jabalíes. Eduardo Barriobero y Herrán, a man of considerable prestige within the anarchist movement of Spain, has been one of the first to join Partido Sindicalista, and he has brought many from his Partido Republicano Federal organization with him, including men such as Emilio Niembro.\n\nThe Radical-Socialist drifter and leader of the failed Partido Radical Socialista Revolucionario, José Antonio Balbontín, has also sought refuge within the ranks of Partido Sindicalista. But perhaps the most interesting new arrivals to the new party have been military men such as Ramón Franco, Salvador Sediles and Antonio Jiménez Jiménez. Despite Partido Sindicalista’s openly pacifist tones, these men have been attracted by promises of a real change, and while they are not true syndicalists in the sense that Ángel Pestaña Nuñez and Salvador Seguí i Rubinat have always been, their arrival is one that has been much celebrated by the new party leadership. Franco and Sediles are heroes of the republican years, and their political activism during the years of exile inspired many to keep the dream of a republic alive. While they now no longer fight for the republic as hard, they will prove to be valuable comrades in PS’ transformation into a legitimate political party."

sprd.556.t:0 "The Trilogy of Martyr Monuments"
sprd.556.d:0 "The legitimization of Partido Sindicalista within the political structures of Spain has allowed anarchists of various colours and orientations an outlet, for the first time in history, to openly mourn and remember martyrs to the cause. This has been most evident in Barcelona, undeniably the most anarchist city in Spain, where a curious monument, or rather a series of monuments, has been constructed for the martyrs of the Spanish anarchist cause. First, and most important of these, is Francisco Ferrer Guardia theatre, built in memory of the anarchist leader executed by the Restoration regime for the supposed planning and instigation of the Tragic Week of 1909. This event was in truth triggered by the decision of Antonio Maura’s conservative government to send reserve troops to Melilla, in reality with many of these being from working-class families.\n\nThe resulting clashes between unions and the state’s cronies led to numerous deaths and untold strife, but also to the false accusations levied at Ferrer that eventually led for him to be blamed for it all. The death of Ferrer would cause further unrest and lead to the fall of Maura’s government, proving that tyrants cannot rely on violence alone to maintain their rule after all. Francisco Ferrer has always been a large idol of Salvador Seguí, and thus it’s not particularly surprising. The other monument, a cinema, was named after Francisco Comes, or Perones as he was known within CNT-FAI at the time, who was murdered by Sindicatos Libres in the faithful incident in 1923 during a gathering of anarchists. Seguí had been intending to attend the meeting as well but had cancelled at the last minute due to security concerns, as the Red Scare prompted by the French Revolution had made left-wing agitators in Spain far more careful.\n\nPerones was killed in cold-blood by the Carlist unionists, and became a rallying cry for the local anarchists looking to fight back the hordes of traditionalist murderers. Finally, rounding out the trio of monuments is a club honouring the name of José Sánchez Rosa, a Sevillan pedagogue and anarcho-syndicalist who was killed in the military uprising of 1932, unable to flee the city as general Sanjurjo’s bloodhounds took it over. These memorials are the first completely open and legal mourning places for the anarchist dead of Spain, and while their opening has earned quite a bit of ire from right-wing newsletters, the chosen martyrs mostly died because of being targeted by reactionary, illegitimate actors, and thus this has allowed Partido Sindicalista to fire back at such naysayers."

sprd.557.t:0 "Final Hours of Free Syndicates"
sprd.557.d:0 "The Sindicatos Libres, a Carlist organization operating in Barcelona, has long been a thorn in the side of Spanish anarchists. The group operates as a direct mockery of the anarchist unions, claiming to represent Catholic workers and those labourers who have grown tired of the aggression of CNT, but in reality the union is little more than a cudgel for the local bosses to batter the rightful strikers of Catalonia with. These yellow syndicalists claim that the workers’ rights can be driven further by simply negotiating and collaborating with the ownership classes, and their Catholic faith is a clear example of the insidious infiltration religion has taken towards the proletariat. Now that Partido Sindicalista has taken the reins for the Kingdom of Spain, the party is in an excellent position to strike at these troublemakers, and crush their pitiful resistance once and for all.\n\nIn the past, they allied the Spanish kingdom to drive out the anarchists from Barcelona, but in an ironic twist of fate, it is the syndicalists who now control the state apparatus and can strike back at them through legal means. With the Carlist cause being a common enemy for both the Spanish Kingdom and the syndicalists, the military and CNT unionists have opened a historic communication channel sharing information of Sindicatos Libres bases and hideouts, and in a large campaign between CNT informants, members of the Spanish police, Cuerpo de Vigilancia, Guardia Civil, Carabineros and some elements of the military have dismantled the entire organization of the Carlist unionists, arresting group leaders Juan Laguía Lliteras and Ramón Sales Amenós in addition to large numbers of their underlings, with legal procedures starting on the length of their incarceration soon.\n\nThis shift action would not have been possible if not for the intelligence data provided by PS’s union allies, and with the loss of the Carlist unionist shock troops, it’s likely that the pretenders of Javier and Carlos Pio will be unable to mount any sufficient resistance to the Alfonsine monarchy. The Barcelona anarchists may now breathe a little more freely, with their most bitter rival defeated. The same raid has also struck the headquarters of Peña Deportiva Ibérica, a minor group of football hooligans who broke away from the club RCD Espanyol de Barcelona and have been relatively active in Carlist and anti-syndicalist policies since, with some of their members also holding ties to Partido Nacionalista, JCAH and even JONS. While this group was nowhere near as influential as Sindicatos Libres, it was nonetheless a dangerous band of rabble rousers, violent hooligans and other scum, which has been dealt with appropriately."

sprd.558.t:0 "The Intellectual Alliance for the Defense of Culture"
sprd.558.d:0 "The electoral victory of Partido Sindicalista has sent shockwaves throughout Spanish society, as despite their moderate stance and commitment to reformist and non-violent workers’ action, they are the most left-wing party in Spain to have held a position of power over the government. The right’s reaction has, somewhat understandably, been one of utter panic, but with the military divided after the return of exiled officers and the Spaniards more accustomed to democracy, the panic has not led to actual substantial threats to PS’s power. However, if the party holds no desires to perform a rebellious revolution in the society of Spain, this does not apply to the cultural field, and during the last couple of months, Ángel Pestaña has made numerous alliances to various cultural giants of the left-wing to drive forward the political ideals of Partido Sindicalista in a format that everyone, from the highest intellectual to the lowliest illiterate peasant, can grasp them for what the party is seeking to accomplish for Spain.\n\nThe greatest stepping stone on this road has been an alliance forged with the group Alianza de Intelectuales para la Defensa de la Cultura, a loose coalition of anarchist, syndicalist, Marxist, vaguely left-wing Valencianist and socialist artists, intellectuals and writers all under the banner of pro-labour cultural revolution. Membership of the group includes such big names as the famed republican activist  María Zambrano, the controversial yet brilliant film director Luis Buñuel, the rising star of PSOE Max Aub and the man whose works are on the walls of every Spanish town and city, cartoonist Manuel Monleón. With their help, Partido Sindicalista hopes to take the cultural side of Spanish society by storm, dislodging the conservative and outright reactionary artists and writers such as Eugenio d’Ors and Blanca de los Rios from the public spotlight, replacing them with idols of the proletariat.\n\nIt is also hoped that someone with the talent of showing societal problems such as Buñuel can truly highlight the numerous problems ailing Spain, and bring the results of Partido Sindicalista’s actions to the forefront. Many within the alliance also hope that other cultural icons sympathetic to left-wing causes, such as Pablo Picasso and Ramón del Valle-Inclán, despite his old Carlist ideals, can become stalwart members of the group so that Spain may finally see itself free from the reactionary drivel and uninspired attacks against those that would see Spain develop towards modernity."

sprd.559.t:0 "Workers and Peasants Reach Out"
sprd.559.d:0 "The Catalan communist group Bloque Obrero y Campesino, led by Joaquín Maurín, has recently reached out to the government of Partido Sindicalista. Maurín’s party is perhaps the strongest remnant of communism in Spain, which frankly is not saying much given the abysmal lack of support and dispersed nature of Spain’s communists. Much of BOC’s support stems from its following of a more moderate line of action, generally subscribing to the tenets of the international right communist lines, advocated by the likes of Jay Lovestone and Nikolay Bukharin. BOC advocates for a highly unionized and collective society that nonetheless mostly focuses on the creation of workers’ cooperatives instead of massive state ownership. BOC has also been a strong ally of CNT-FAI, given that Maurín’s first foray into politics was within the ranks of CNT, but he abandoned the organization to develop his own communist-syndicalist mixture union.\n\nBOC would develop from his distaste for the remaining communist groups in Spain, and Maurín’s experiences with the international communist movements made him more moderate to the point that he resists the notion of a dictatorship of the proletariat completely. To Maurín, if a dictatorship of the reactionaries is replaced with a dictatorship of the proletariat, then it is no victory at all. As such, while Maurín and BOC hardly like the kingdom any more than member’s of Partido Sindicalista, they have become rather close to the party of moderate syndicalists, and have reached out to negotiate an alliance, or perhaps, a complete integration of BOC into the ranks of Partido Sindicalista.\n\nMaurín and his close allies within BOC argue that Partido Sindicalista possesses the best means to achieve a true peaceful revolution within Spain, and unlike PSOE, which suffers from internal fracturing, ridiculous party-union bickering and other internal issues, Partido Sindicalista is more concentrated and thus able to push their policies through. However, some within PS warn against complete integration, claiming that BOC originally sought to infiltrate CNT-FAI from the inside to turn it into a communist organization in the past, and could seek to do so here as well. Still, with BOC as an ally or even part of the organization of PS, the new rising darling of Spain’s left could push its program to even greater heights."

sprd.560.d:0 "With the rise of moderate, or at least non-revolutionary anarchism, the CNT union has kicked out the remaining firebrands belonging to the revolutionary organization FAI, with many former faistas of a more well-rounded ideology integrating back to the union peacefully. The new shift has also led to the elections of a new general secretary of the FAI, Horacio Martínez Prieto, a Basque anarcho-syndicalist who has long advocated for the creation of a party of libertarians, and has now taken the reins after Ángel Pestaña resigned from his post to lead Partido Sindicalista. Prieto is not quite as moderate as the members of Partido Sindicalista, but his preference for syndicalist politics over the revolutionary and apolitical line of FAI radicals is a welcome change, and it is expected that under his stewardship, CNT continues to develop away from being more than just an union aimed at progressing the rights of workers through strikes and negotiations.\n\nPrieto has a considerable following in Bilbao, the most industrialized part of Basque Country, forged over decades of agitation and popular engagement starting when he was but a teenager trying to push the tenets of anarchism through the revolutionary route. His actions there became legendary as he was constantly on the run from Guardia Civil, to the point that at one point he had to have an execution faked by sympathisers within the police to avoid his pursuers. After the years of pistolerismo, Prieto would correct his stances within the movement and abandoned aggressive anarchist revolutionary actions as the means to progress the cause. He would align with the likes of Pestaña and Salvador Seguí and was one of the instrumental leaders of CNT-FAI at a time when Spain stood at the precipice of chaos, with only the actions of men like him allowing the anarchists to reconcile their differences with the conservative government to avoid a total collapse.\n\nHowever, Prieto has preferred to continue working within CNT instead of joining Partido Sindicalista, unconcerned with the wider politics of Spain and more interested in the workers’ struggle through unionism. Still, while he is not party of PS, he has suggested that the party adopts a name he had promoted for CNT-FAI to adopt back when he was pushing for the anarchist movement to take their place in the parliament, this name being Partido Socialista Libertario, which Prieto feels could help further distance the movement from CNT and its anarcho-syndicalists."

Prieto met with the leader of FSL, Juan López Sánchez. FSL first broke from CNT-FAI even before the creation of Partido Sindicalista, seeing the influence of FAI on the wider anarchist movement as detrimental to the cause of Spanish syndicalism, with Spain being little more than a feudal remnant left floating in the edge of Europe, possessing nothing of the characteristics needed to carry out a revolution of a similar style to the French and British ones.\n\nLike Russia, where the Bolsheviks tried and failed to push through a revolution with inadequate means and apathetic rural populations, so here in Spain an anarchist revolution would only lead to misery for the people of Spain, crushed by the reactionaries because of their strong grip on the countryside thanks to the church and the cacique bosses. As such, FSL has always argued for a slow, methodical process of supporting republican institutions so that a bourgeois republic could give way to a Spain more hospitable to transform into a new, syndicalist society.\n\n With the success of Partido Sindicalista, FSL has seen that not even republicanism is necessary for the purposes of this transformation, and that the work of Spain’s syndicalists can be carried out even under the primordial institution of a monarchy as long as the king is kept at an arms length from politics. While FSL was hardly a massive force of Spanish unionism, its return to the embrace of CNT has further strengthened the possibilist tendency within the unionist movement as a whole, and Spain is more stable and equal thanks to it now."

sprd.562.d:0 "As Partido Sindicalista continues to consolidate its rule and push Spain towards the true utopia of a nation free of capitalism and overbearing statism, many within the party nonetheless view the Spanish military with ever greater suspicion. While the most horrendous tyrants of the army kicked out, such as José Millán Astray and Juan Yagüe y Blanco, men known to harbour incredibly dangerous right-wing radical sympathies, and the Butcher of Barcelona, Severiano Martínez Anido long dead and buried, the man whose cronies murdered hundreds of brave anarchists and socialists during the pistolerismo, the army is still a hotbed of reaction. However, Partido Sindicalista has been granting amnesties left and right, freeing prisoners from the various torture chambers of the military and bringing former military men of the republican era back to Spain from exile.\n\nThe return of Eduardo de Medrano y Rivas, a former artillery captain and leading figure of Partido Sindicalista, to the ranks of the army, has been particularly celebrated among the members of the new party, and with him have come other loyal officers to the left-wing causes, such as Antonio Jiménez Jiménez, These officers have been quick to ally themselves with other republican and socialist officers, such as Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer and Julio Mangada, who may not share the ideological tenets of Partido Sindicalista to the letter but are as committed to ensuring that no more military coups are allowed to happen. Partido Sindicalista has attempted to not go too harsh on the military because of the fear that it will provoke a response similar to the Sanjurjada, but the inclusion of new socialist and republican officers to the ranks the Royal Spanish Military does mean that little by little, the army, navy and air force will transform from a nest of reactionary vipers into a true instrument of Spanish defence, no longer just a tool of ensuring the rule of capital and tradition."

sprd.563.d:0 "As Partido Nacionalista’s new position as the far-right party of democratic Spain solidifies, many former members of Unión Patriótica are flocking to its banners to defend the true values of the Catholic homeland from godless republicans and socialists. One such man is Emilio Rodríguez Tarduchy, a former close ally of the dictator Primo de Rivera and a loyal member of his party, who has since been left adrift politically. Rodríguez performed key roles in propaganda during the dictatorship and was thus shunned by the republican regime, but even after the Sanjurjada coup his career was mostly stagnating thanks to his traditionalist inclinations. These inclinations would lead to him being mistaken for a Carlist, with Rodríguez’s role as the editor of the traditionalist newspaper El Siglo Futuro certainly not helping the matter.\n\nAs Partido Nacionalista began its meteoric rise to power, Rodríguez felt that he had finally found a party for him, and has since joined the organization. His work for El Siglo Futuro has helped attract wayward Carlists, integrists and a host of other traditionalists into the party as well. Alfredo Jiménez-Millas, one of the young Carlists who attended meetings held by Rodríguez in Café Lyon, has been one of these converts, though in his case it was more of a mutual one as the two joined PNE around the same time. While Rodríguez may have fallen out of the general favour of the military, his position within the ranks has been instrumental in establishing further connections and even reeling in some Carlist officers such as José Enrique Varela and Ricardo Rada Peral.\n\nRada Peral and Varela in turn have approached some of the more collaborative strains of Carlism, headed by Count of Rodezno, on the grounds of a possible unification between the Comunión Tradicionalista and Partido Nacionalista. Many other nationalists, especially from Acción Popular, have been quick to call these alliances dangerous destabilizing of the new monarchist regime given the importance of the Carlists in the near collapse of Spanish society in 1936, but in truth, the Carlist groups that remain today are mere shadows of the former communion, scattered, broken and fighting for scraps of support among themselves over which king to support. It wouldn’t take much to nudge the more moderate wing of Carlism to our side, putting an end to the dynastic schism once and for all."

However, it is far from the first Partido Nacionalista in the Hispanic world, and as the prominence of PNE grows, many have started to point out that another Hispanist Partido Nacionalista exists in the New World, and similar to us, maintains a semblance of democracy to legitimize itself. This is the Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico, led by the firebrand nationalist and freedom fighter Pedro Albizu Campos.\n\nThe party was harshly suppressed by the Yankee dogs and their imperialist ambitions to keep the good people of Latin America down, with Albizu captured on numerous occasions and supporters of his shot on the streets for protesting his capture, but now that the situation in the United States has devolved to the point of no return, Puerto Rico has a chance to be free. As such, while PNPR is in many ways different from the ideas of PNE, supporters of PNE have suggested that we should approach Albizu and offer them protection of Spain, as one Hispanist nationalist to another. While this might appear to be a paternalistic return to Spanish rule, in reality the nationalists of Spain are simply keen to ensure that fellow Hispanists are able to thrive just as they have done here in the old country. However, there are those within PNE who say we should keep our hands off from the new world, just because Spain is not yet ready to contest the United States, even in its weakened state."

sprd.565.d:0 "The popularity of Partido Nacionalista continues to soar, and many conservatives from all across the spectrum of Spanish nationalism trickle into the ranks of the new traditionalist party. However, perhaps the most curious new arrival has been from the movement of Ramiro Ledesma, Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Syndicalista, as one of the first supporters and financiers of Ledesma’s magazine, La Conquista del Estado, has deserted the reds and joined Partido Nacionalista. This may appear to be surprising, given the national syndicalist agenda of JONS and its alliance with the terrorists of FAI, but José Félix de Lequerica, the new member of PNE, is a man of many ideological inspirations. His past as a traditionalist and member of the Maurist circle in Basque Country, especially as part of the movement Liga de Acción Monárquica, aimed at suppressing Basque nationalism, has attracted him back to traditionalism, and while PNE is hardly open to the reactionary strain of nationalism that Lequerica espouses, that being a mix of Maurrasian and Sorelian ideas, he has nonetheless managed to get into the good graces of the party leadership.\n\nHis connections to the intellectual elite of the Basque Country, especially through the Noucentista club Café Lion D'Or, have already been extremely potent in gaining new members for PNE, especially from those who would have otherwise joined our rival reactionary groups such as Renovación Española or Acción Popular. Men such as Pedro Mourlane Michelena, the tireless right-wing journalist, and the illustrious conservative novelist, Rafael Sánchez Mazas, have all been attracted to PNE thanks to an endorsement from Lequerica, and we can expect others from LAM to also make their way to join the new party. The Spanish nationalists in Basque Country seem especially interested in getting the support of PNE, as the region has a long history with traditionalism but remains plagued by the Basque nationalists who keep the degenerate spirit of the republic alive and attack the good institutions of Spanish Kingdom whenever they can.\n\nLequerica has also been active in trying to create a true union ally for Partido Nacionalista, something which José María Albiñana, PNE’s leader, had little interest in. Lequerica cites the success of the Basque Solidaridad de los Trabajadores Vascos union as a great example of what conservative unionism can achieve if given enough support and funding. There are some Catholic unions in Spain at the moment, such as the Coalición Española de Trabajadores of AP as well as more regional affairs, but with PNE’s ability to mobilize reactionary youth, the party could seek to create a Sindicatos Libres-style paramilitary-union hybrid, which Lequerica supports given his Sorelian influences."

However, before now, José María Albiñana has been heavily promoting the idea of Hispanism and the God-ordained unity of Spain, but with the need for political support, it would appear that some leeway is given to harmless regional movements.\n\nThis is especially the case with PNE’s newest alliances with the Leonese group Grupo de Tradiciones Leonesas, which is of markedly monarchist, Catholic and traditionalist nature. Led by Domínguez Berrueta, it has become a fortress of Leonese conservatism, allying with other local right-wing groups such as the rural agrarian party Acción Agraria Leonesa and the conservative women’s group Acción Femenina Leonesa, led by the matron of Spanish reactionary feminism Francisca Bohigas. These groups promote the revival of Leon’s traditional institutions and regional cultural, and some Leonese regionalists, such as Eugenio Merino, have supported closer ties between Castille and Leon. Partido Nacionalista still has little love for regionalism, but these new Leonese allies have opened up the doors for other movements of similar calibre, such as the Galician Dereita Galeguista and Catalan Derecha de Catalunya, though many have protested forming an alliance with the latter due to the view that its members are all capitalist barons and other financial elite.\n\nThis is hardly an unfair criticism, as members of the party such as José María de Albert Despujol and Miguel Mateu y Pla are financiers, industrialists and some of the wealthiest men in Catalonia. However, with the only other option being the blatantly Catalanist and somewhat corrupt Lliga Regionalista, many view that DdC is the lesser evil. Nonetheless, even if Catalonia remains outside of our grasp, the new allies in Leon and Galicia are bound to increase support for PNE and further expand our powerbase in the nation, even if allying with regionalists somewhat compromises our party promises."

Delgado’s career as a journalist has made him the perfect ally to the somewhat clumsy public performer Albiñana, but whereas the latter has always been a staunch traditionalist and open to allying other monarchists, Delgado is enamoured with the idea of Italian legionarism and openly despises the democratic framework in which PNE now operates. He has on many occasions been caught organizing raids on unionists or regionalist groups, usually with the most radical and violent sections of Legionaries de Albiñana, and continues to be a common weak point in the party that the left-wing parties pick at when critiquing PNE’s attempts to fit into the democratic system.\n\nDelgado has been ordered to fix his act multiple times by the leadership of the party, yet continues to defy orders, and it has escalated to the point that the feud between him and the more moderate members of PNE is present in his writings for the party newspaper La Legión as well as his own daily issue La Nación. His attacks against political opponents are rather erratic but the most constant ones are accusations that Masons, Jews and syndicalists have infiltrated the party and are twisting it to become a puppet for international shadow organizations. However, most worrying new development has been the fact that Delgado is mustering close allies and veterans of the Morocco war around his person, with rumours spreading that he is organizing a new party called Legión Nacional, taking clear influence from the Italian Arditi movements of post-Weltkrieg as well as the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana party residing in the Italian Northern Republic. While these are little more than rumours at this point, it is clear that Delgado could become a threat to the party and its new more moderate line, and as such, ignoring him could be a grave mistake. Going after him would introduce its own problems, such as the sudden loss of the most important mouthpieces of Partido Nacionalista, but such a short-term vacancy is likely the better option than Delgado causing more problems for the party."

sprd.568.d:0 "The Red Don of PSOE, a man who emerged as the leader of the Spanish worker’s movement in the early 1930s and has guided it thus far, Julián Besteiro Fernández, has been found dead in his home today. The rigours of leadership and the tumultuous Spanish politics of the last decade have taken a toll on the venerable socialist leader, and his fading health had already been widely known within the nation, but nonetheless, the news have been met with a great deal of sorrow from the members of PSOE and UGT as well as their left-wing allies and those on the right who respected Besteiro despite the ideological differences.\n\nBesteiro, a life-long leader of the moderate wing of PSOE, was always considered to be the balancing check to the revolutionary ambitions of Largo Caballero, and many more radical socialists considered Besteiro to be a far cry from a socialist, and many of his detractors called him a Spanish Menshevik after the Russian ones. These naysayers did not massively affect Besteiro’s career however, and despite drifting towards more conservative positions later in his life, he remained committed to the cause of Spanish workers’ and the legacy of Pablo Iglesias, guiding PSOE in his twilight years before the final days with confidence in the cause.\n\nAs socialists around the nation mourn, PSOE prepares itself to choose a new leader for the party, a difficult task given how many different factions and cliques are vying for power within the Spanish socialists. Many experts predict that the party may opt to find a somewhat fresh candidate not burdened with the package of the different cliques, as the rule of Besteiro has shown that preference towards just one of the factions does lead to a great deal of friction within PSOE itself and most importantly, within the federal unions of the UGT. But before any such preparations can be taken, a funeral for Besteiro will be held, and it will most likely be one only rivaled by the one held for the honourable Pablo Iglesias himself."

It is, by all accounts, a professional and well-run sporting organization whose main flaw has been not winning even more. However, a group of their supporters has accumulated a reputation that is perhaps not as pristine as that of the club they support. That is the Peña Ibérica, which at first glance may be just another Peña or supporter’s organization, but apart from starting feuds with Barcelona supporters, it has actually dipped its toes into the realm of politics. The Peña Ibérica members are mainly middle class, although quite a few of them have a Carlist past or right-wing sympathies, not least among which being José María Poblador Álvarez, a ringleader and Catalan jonsista that was originally a Carlist militant. The Peña has mostly faded into obscurity by the present year, with it becoming irrelevant and their members joining other organizations. However, amongst their political dabbling, they helped set up the Partido Nacionalista Español in Catalunya. While doomed to just be a footnote in history, their political endeavours have made a not so insignificant mark in Spanish politics, even if few know their name."

As it happened inside one of the most industrialized regions in all of Spain, they had the know-how and the resources to arm themselves with equipment far beyond that which your average merry band of revolutionaries could even dare imagine possessing, even if still far from an actual competent armed force. Among these were the so called “Tiznaos” or armoured cars, which potentially stretched the definition of what “armoured” constitutes, but were at least better than getting shot out on the streets.\n\nThe workers, having experience from their industrial background as well as having gotten themselves familiarized with the Tractor Landesa and the Trubia Naval which were produced in the region, were able to rudimentarily attach sheets of metal plating to almost any vehicle they could find, although some worked much better than others. While we probably won’t see them again unless we are in a time of dire need, they have nevertheless generated experience in building vehicles of the type and will make for an interesting tidbit in history."

And yet, even despite the usual so-called “peace dividends”, it hasn’t completely atrophied, maintaining a high degree of professionality and keeping themselves at the forefront of innovation in many fields, such as manoeuvre warfare and aviation technology. All of this is because of the simple fact, and that is the fact that they know the Communards and Russians will one day come knocking to take back what they feel was taken from them.\n\nAligning with the world hegemon was only natural for Spain, who resides in the same continent as them and has plenty of common interests. One such interest is one they have now almost guaranteed to be facing off against, and that is the (Insert Commune of France name). Knowing this fact, the Spanish legion has been taking part with the German Sturmtruppen, another famous warfare innovation from the First Weltkrieg. The Sturmtruppen have been relaying their expertise in trench warfare as well as general combat experience to their Spanish counterparts, allowing Spanish officers and soldiers an opportunity to improve their combat abilities and cohesion with Reichspakt troops in general. Meanwhile, the Spanish legion has been sharing their experience as part of the Army of Africa as well as urban combat experience from putting down the Asturias uprising. While some may say the way the winds are blowing has changed, current reality remains that infantry will be the backbone of every army for the foreseeable future, and as such we can make sure our troops are as well-trained and capable as can be, especially with the Communards right on our doorstep."

The vast Austrian real encompasses three important mountain ranges in the form of the Alps, the Balkans and the Carpathians, as well as other minor mountains. Even in just the First Weltkrieg, they had to fight against the Italians through the Alps, the Serbs through the Balkans and the Russians and Romanians through the Carpathians, meaning that they have a lot to teach anyone about mountain fighting. While the Spanish realm isn’t as vast, it is still pretty mountainous in its nature. There are eight major mountain ranges within mainland Spain with the Pyrenees in the northeast, Cordillera Cantabrica in the north, Sistema Iberico just below the Pyrenees, Sierra de Cuenca and Serrania de Cuenca in the east, Montes de Toledo in the centre of Iberian Peninsula, Cordillera Betica and Sierra Nevada in the south, and we are also no strangers to fighting across the Atlas mountains that inhabit the North African terrain. \n\nAs dark clouds gather over Europe, we continue looking across the Pyrenees to our Communard neighbours, with the uneasy knowledge that one day one of us is going to have to cross the same mountains that Hannibal, Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi, Napoleon and so many other generals of history have had to cross, and that only one of us and their way of life will endure. Our Viennese allies and us have thus decided to carry out planned exercises on the mountains within our realms, revisiting old Austrian war documents as well as Rif War documents, analysing possible fortifications, teaching our troops how to survive amongst the harsh conditions, artillery shooting positions, etc. While it is almost certain there will be no glorious breakthrough across these mountains straight to Paris, we must nevertheless be prepared for any eventualities, and make sure our troops are ready to fight across any terrain."

However, they have largely fallen out of favour in the past few decades because of an event still fresh in the minds of everyone in the British Commonwealth: The Gallipoli campaign in the First Weltkrieg. The campaign was such a disaster that no such operation was undertaken again for the rest of the war, and the quarter of a million British, Canadian, New Zealander, Australian and other lives which now laid idly in the beaches of Anatolia are still painfully remembered by all those involved. \n\nYet as we have chosen to join their struggle in the reclamation of their mainland territories along with the French, we also have to face the fact that even our combined forces are not prepared to storm across the Apennines and overwhelm the Communards, nor are we ready to storm the white cliffs of Dover with a Spanish Armada like we once planned centuries ago. Thus, the forces of the Entente have gathered along the southern coast of Spain, where we can once again summon the spirit of Alhucemas that gave us victory in the Rif war a little over a decade ago. While Canadian and French officers give orders and suggestions as well as help out with the logistics of the exercise, Spanish marines certainly prove no slouches in invading the makeshift beachheads. Many issues have presented themselves, such as the weather, keeping weapons dry, the inadequacy of our current landing craft, among others.

Yet, even with the uncertainty of even being able to play on the weekends, football remained one of Spain’s biggest pastimes. As such, and with increasing enlistment in the armed forces, a group of three officers decided to create a football club made up of air force recruits with football abilities. Yet despite the supposedly small recruiting pool that this gave them, they were quickly able to find enough volunteers to form two teams and start playing amongst themselves. \n\nThe squad soon took to the professional football fields, and facing off against many established but struggling clubs, they started making a name for themselves by beating many of these teams. As such, they were able to participate in the Copa del Rey in 1939, although they couldn’t make it past the quarterfinals. By the 1939-1940 season, having proven their quality, they were allowed by the Real Federación Española de Fútbol into the second division, taking over the recently disappeared Nacional de Madrid’s place. And in this season, they have taken Spanish football by storm, winning the second division to gain promotion to La Liga as well as the Campeonato Regional Mancomunado, while also beating 1940 Copa del Rey winners RCD Espanyol in an unofficial friendly.

The Trubia, which was based on the Renault FT-17 from the First Weltkrieg, is lacking in many of the recent developments such as a main turret, a powerful engine, armour thickness and geometry, crew accommodations and various other advancements of the new era. To none has this fact been more obvious than to Félix Verdeja Bardules, an artillery captain who has overseen the maintenance company of the newly formed First Tank Battalion. Due to his position, he has grown very familiar with the shortcomings of the brand-new tank project, and especially its outdatedness. \n\nWith this experience and readings of recent developments around the world, he has commissioned a new tank design, which has been named after him. Despite some pushback from foreign observers and even generals inside the army which doubt Spain’s capacity to make a modern tank of its own, the initial prototype has performed admirably, even if it isn’t yet at the forefront of global tank designs. The tank shall undergo further revisions before it goes into full production, and while it still has its detractors inside and outside of Spain, Verdeja has nevertheless set the stage for our first indigenous modern tank design."

For this, they commissioned the Carro Ligero Trubia, a light tank based on the design of the Renault FT-17 that first saw the light of day in the fields of France. This project was assigned to the Fábrica de Armas de Trubia in 1925, with it being fitted with two independent turrets on the main turret and it having a 50hp Hispano-Suiza engine, although this was later replaced with a Daimler engine that produced 75hp. However, despite the promising start for the project and the fact Spain had its first native tank design, the project never managed to take off due to many reasons, not least of which production delays, lack of funds, the general instability of the country, etc., all this meaning only 4 prototypes have been completed to date. \n\nHowever, with the situation in Spain starting to look up, we can finally put forth the necessary resources to turn this into a proper project. While making a fully native-built Spanish tank armada may still be just wishful thinking, we can start ramping up production and equipping the first few fully armoured battalions in the upcoming months and years."

This was the severe lack of weapons that could combat the improvised armoured contraptions of the Asturians, the tiznaos. These vehicles were hardly state of the art, and some could even be pierced with regular rifles due to irregularities in steel quality or bad welding, riveting or other means of mounting the plates onto the trucks, but very often the soldiers would have to improvise in turn to destroy the vehicles. Direct fire from artillery pieces proved the most effective one, but it was hardly an easy solution and often put the gun crews in danger, something Spain is hardly in a position to lose.\n\nHowever, one ingenious solution proposed by the rising general Francisco Franco was to use improvised incendiary devices and gasoline bombs to counter the rebels’ armoured cars. Two-pound glass jars or bottles filled with gasoline were then stuffed with a rag or a similar flammable piece of cloth to act as a rudimentary carrier for the fire. These bombs would then be thrown in front of the tank, destroying the bottle but spreading the burning gasoline in a pattern so that the rubber tires of the tanks would be destroyed, alongside other components such as the carburetor. Some heavier armoured vehicles could also be destroyed by throwing these bombs onto the back of the vehicle, making the burning liquid seep down into the engine below or the crew compartment.\n\nElements of the Spanish foreign legion under Franco’s command were first to use these bombs, but the use spread to other units as well, and while the weapon is crude and dangerous to the user, it is the best Spain has to offer for the time being. Of course, nicknames for these things have spread nearly as fast as the gasoline from a broken bomb, with the nicknames ponche and poncho being relatively popular though some have also named them after prominent socialist leaders involved in the Asturian affair.."

However, now things have gotten even more ambitious, as with the creation of Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial, the sky is no longer the limit, but space itself. Headed by a veritable Renaissance man of Spain, Esteban Terradas Illa. Terradas has held a number of positions related to the study of mathematics, physics and engineering, and as a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, he has always been pushing for the creation of an organization similar to INTA.\n\nThe task of INTA is, especially early, merely that of research, with the institution gathering information of the upper layers of the atmosphere, creating equipment needed for such tasks, advicing military and civilian personnel and institutions in matters related to Spain and also, crucially, increasing public awareness on the matters that INTA researches. It has collaborated closely with the space enthusiast and military man Emilio Herrera Linares, who previously completed his stratonautical diving suit in the mid 1930s. In the role of conventional engineering related to creating the equipment, INTA has absorbed the Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros Aeronáuticos, a school related to the study of aeronautics and the material research needed for the needs of the fledgling Spanish air industry.\n\nETSIA was left practically abandoned during the late 1930s as the lack of funding and the present chaos in the political scene of Spain made it impossible to fund the institute’s endeavours. Now, it seems that Herrera and Terradas are committed to make the dream of space travel, or at least the study of space, a reality. Terradas may very well be the most capable man of seeing this happen, as when he met Albert Einstein in 1923 when the scientist legend was visiting Barcelona, Einstein remarked that ‘This is one of the five most intelligent men I know, and one of the few who can today understand the Theory of Relativity’. While most of Spain has absolutely no idea what INTA is actually doing and how their plans are going to come into fruition, one thing is certain. The institute will surely help Spain bridge the gap it has to other European powers, and who knows, perhaps it is Spanish stratonauts who will conquer the final frontier of humanity."

This pistol is the JO.LO.AR, designed by and named after José López de Arnáiz, whose patent was bought by the Spanish-Basque weapons manufacturer Bonifacio Echeverría SA or STAR, as it is more commonly known. The JO.LO.AR is generally a relatively standard weapon of its type, being a blowback semiauto pistol, but the patent of López is what makes the weapon so perfectly suited for cavalry duty.\n\nThe pistol has a specific design quirk with its lever, named palanca by its creator, which allows the pistol to be operated one handed, even to the point of charging the action and chambering a round. The weapon was relatively unsuccessful thus far, but it was sold to the Peruvian police who used it in the American .45 ACP calibre, and they adopted it with the idea that a cavalryman or mounted police officer can still operate the weapon while holding the reins of a horse with another hand. This maneuvre is hardly an easy one, but according to the Peruvians, it can be mastered with practice and does provide a lot more freedom for the user than a regular pistol or revolver would. The pistol holds potential, and as the army has expressed more interest towards it, a rumour has been circulated that the pistol could have started off as a homage to the one-handed general of the Spanish army José Millán-Astray, though as of now this is merely a rumour."

However, like any region of Spain, it is defended by the Spanish military, and like the much more populous region of Rif, Spanish Sahara mostly employs troops from the local Sahrawi tribesmen. These troops are known as the Tropas Nómadas, an auxiliary force created to patrol the vast deserts of the Golden River. Originally, these lands had a small gendarmerie troop Compañia de Policia a Pie, but it was soon militarised a bit further with the creation of the Tropas de Policia del Sahara, who received camel mounts and patrolled far greater distances than the original group, who mainly guarded the more important coastal regions. Successes with the Tropas de Policia led to the creation of an actual military force with the Tropas Nómadas, with Spanish officers and NCOs as well as a few specialists.\n\nThe creation of such a force was partially inspired by the successes of French army Meharistes as well as the use of the Regulares indigenous force in the Rif, and while the Tropas Nómadas remains a small force, employing mostly locals with knowledge of the terrain and the necessities of survival in these difficult lands, they are proving to be an excellent unit for the task of patrolling the deserts. While there is little of value in the region, some trade routes between Morocco, Mittelafrika’s northernmost territories and the Nationalist French regime do run through Rio de Oro and thus the presences of these police forces does prevent Berbers and other local tribes from preying on trade caravans. Similarly, while Tropas Nómadas is not a true military force and the loyalty of the locals in a time of war is questionable to many Spanish officers, they may act as a first line of defence should Spain find itself at war with the various imperialist powers around itself. Morocco especially claims Spanish Sahara at its own, so the presence of a police force with rapid response potential in the region does dissuade Casablanca’s king from trying anything."

sprd.611.d:0 "The Spanish army in the metropole has always been something of a mixed bag, with very varying quality of officers, weapons and troops posted in different corners of the nation. The lack of good training compounds with the severe drought of good equipment for the army, and many soldiers are little more than servants to their officers, with many being unable to even fire their weapons accurately or service them properly. However, one area where the Spanish army is more than a match for any other European power is in its African units, or Fuerzas Militares de Marruecos as they are known in the military. These troops, hardened by many skirmishes with the Rif rebels and reinforced by the elite troops of the Spanish Foreign Legion, are mainly made up of the tabors of the Regulares, units made up of local Rifian and Moroccan soldiers with most of their leadership made up of Spaniards.\n\nArmed with the best the Oviedo arsenals can offer, the Regulares are primarily infantry troops and often occupy the same role as the Legionaries, with them being used as shock troops. This role does cause quite a bit more casualties to these divisions, but given their experience, the Regulares are some of the only forces in Spain capable of undertaking such a dangerous task. They were used in the capacity during the Asturias rising, where they proved themselves effective, if not extremely ruthless force, not lessened by the brutal attitude of their commanders such as Juan Yagüe y Blanco and Francisco Franco. The Regulares are primarily made up of infantry, but given the conditions of the Rif, two groups of cavalry are also present. As can be expected from such a valuable unit, they have been awarded nearly as much as the Spanish Legion for their combat prowess, and some, such as Mohamed Meziane, or Mohammed ben Mizzian, have even risen to the rank of Lieutenant General.\n\nThe prestige of these troops and their many actions during wartime have even formed an odd bond between the local troops and their Spanish officers, with many using the connection between Spain and Morocco as a means to explain the fraternal nature between Spanish troops and Rifian Regulares, though despite the close nature of the men and their officers, the Spaniards still hold a very paternalistic view of their troops. In Spain, these ‘Moors’ are deeply hated by those who have had the misfortune of facing them in battle, as the brutality of the Spanish Army of Africa has cost the lives of many Asturian miners and Catalan anarchists. Nonetheless, as the Spanish army begins to reform itself, the old guard is attempting to model the needs of the army through the Regulares, placing the indigenous rifleman as the model for what every Spanish soldier should aspire to become as well.."

sprd.612.d:0 "The Spanish army has traditionally been divided into brigades of three central types, these being infantry, cavalry and artillery brigades. However, in the early 1930s, an experimental unit composition was made with the mixed brigades, or composite brigades as they are sometimes also called. The experiment was carried out in Asturias, among the local mountaineer forces, as these types of units were often working with very limited manpower in difficult terrain and could thus not rely on having entire groups of armies operating autonomously. These brigades were aimed at creating units that had the advantages of the three central brigade types by having companies and battalions from the various different types of brigades mixed into one. With the mountain troops, this experiment was a success, and similar composition was tried as the Marine Corps was resurrected, with them also using the mixed brigade model. However, now, there have been plans to introduce the structure to the army proper, with a varied force composition.\n\nThis would see the average army brigade transform into a force with four infantry battalions, a cavalry squadron that is either motorised or operating from horseback depending on the situation, and four batteries, these operating mostly the Scheneider infantry guns, or in the case of the mountaineers, using various mountain guns fit for the purpose. In addition to these larger units, every brigade would also have a complement of sappers, medical personnel, logistics units and other necessary troops for the function of the brigade. However, the amount of artillery is merely theoretical, and unless the factories of Reinosa gear up their production of new guns massively, the new mixed brigades must have to make do with simply a singular battery until new weapon production of heavy weapons is at an acceptable level. Nonetheless, while not all Spanish brigades will undergo such transformation at first, there will be enough units converted to further experiment with the formula and hopefully provide enough feedback on the structure to review its effectiveness in the future."

Indeed, it was in Spain where two Greek sailors reportedly undertook the first instance of submarine travel in the Tajo River in front of King Carlos V. Fast forward a few centuries, and Cosme García patented the Garcibuzo (The Garci-diver) in 1860, making him one of first recognized submarine inventors in the world. And yet, it wouldn’t stop there, as around the same timeframe Narciso Monturiol would develop the Ictíneos I and II, making Spain one of the global centres of submarine development, capped off by the Peral, designed by Isaac Peral, which was the world’s first electric powered submarines.\n\nIt was by the time of the Weltkrieg that Spain, while still reeling from the Disaster of ‘98, was looking to build twenty-eight submarines for its brand-new fleet according to vice admiral Augusto Miranda y Godoy’s 1915 Naval Plan. Yet, as the fleet wasn’t yet ready for any engagements, it watched helplessly as Germany’s submarines wreaked havoc on transatlantic trade and harassed vulnerable Spanish merchant vessels, as the Germans seemed to have mastered the art of underwater seafaring. One such harbinger of destruction, named UB-23, was a seasoned veteran of the Atlantic, having sunk 51 ships before being struck by a British depth charge in July 1917 and managing to travel all the way to A Coruña, where it was promptly interned.\n\n Despite German protests, it was eventually sold to Spain for 1 348 000 Reichsmarks in order to help out the struggling German economy. The submarine, now in the Spanish Armada’s possession, was used to study and examine the faults of then current submarine designs as well as serving as a practice vessel for sailors to familiarize themselves with submarine warfare. While the type has since been withdrawn from actual combat roles, it continues to serve its final years as a training vessel for the aspirants seeking to join the most stealthy combat role in the Spanish fleet, and it is planned that once UB-23 has served for as long as it can, it will be transformed into a monument in front of the Spanish Naval Academy in Cadiz."

However, world-wide, big things are happening with rifle designs, specifically the transition to semi-automatic designs capable of firing far more rounds in the time a typical bolt-action rifle would need. The Americans are, despite their financial difficulties, attempting to push out the M1 Garand rifle to every man in their army, and the Germans, French, Russian and Japanese militaries all have their own programs aimed at harnessing the fierce firepower of the semi-automatic designs.\n\nThe Spanish military has largely watched these developments passively, testing a few designs such as the Czech ZK-381 rifle and the Mexican Mondragón rifle, but none have progressed to adoption due to budgetary constrains and various old school generals claiming that a soldier with so much firepower in his hand will simply waste bullets and cause logistical hang-ups with their unneeded ammo expenditure. However, now that Spain is no longer reeling from the worst economic crisis of a century, the military staff has revisited a design from two officers of the Oviedo arsenal, bringing a much needed domestic answer to the semi-automatic rifle dilemma. Officers Mariñas and Ramirez de Arellano designed the Sistema MR 1932 semi-automatic rifle already back in 1932, though the first prototype took a bit of time to finally come out.\n\nA curious design, it uses a gastrap system, giving it a distinct front-heavy look. For ammunition, the weapon uses standard 10-round stripper clips in Spanish military 7.92x57 millimetre cartridges, giving it double the capacity of standard Mausers. The rifle was originally designed by the pair to be used by skilled riflemen of Spanish squads, to be used as a special fire support weapon instead of a direct standard first-line battle rifle. This decision was made out of logistical needs, as the two officers, far too familiar with the dire state of Spanish army supply department, sought a solution to the issue of increasing firepower in the constraints of said lack of ammunition production and delivery. As such, most Spanish troops would still use Mauser rifles, with the best shooters given the more potent weapon. Many officers have urged the military staff to adopt the new design urgently, to boost the meagre firepower of the Spanish army, but some old guard generals are still rather unconvinced."

The armoured car, built by Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval in the town of Sestao near the eponymous city of Bilbao. Using the base of a Dodge truck, with a provision to swap into local production from Ford Motor Ibérica later on, the vehicle is a rather boxy and crude design, armed with a single Hotchkiss machine gun. While the armoured vehicle is nothing out of the ordinary for such patrol vehicles, its armour, reliability and excellent usage as an urban assault vehicle has earned it a place among the toolbox of any urban police force of Spain that has the means or connections to get some in their arsenal. However, the main armament of a single machine gun has long been an issue of the vehicle. This rarely leads to difficult predicaments in normal policing and anti-riot roles, but when engaging heavily armed and entrenched enemies, such as is often the case against anarchist militants, the machine gun can struggle to force the enemies out of their hiding holes.\n\nThus, some inventive souls within our nation’s cavalry and police forces have taken it upon themselves to rectify this dangerous deficit of firepower, and field modifications to install a flamethrower have taken place in various units around the country. The new creation, often called simply Bilbao Modelo 1932 Lanzallamas, has no real visual distinction from a typical Bilbao car, save for a large flamethrower rod poking out the co-driver’s hatch, and the installment of auxiliary fuel tanks meant to supply ammunition to the Lanzallamas fire thrower. Some adaptable officers have been quick to suggest a more standardized variant of the type to be put into protection, perhaps with an actual shield for the flamethrower operator, with some going as far as to suggest that the Hotchkiss machine gun be removed and a flamethrower to be installed on its place. However, given the vehicle’s primary role as an armoured fist of the police, some logisticians and other functionaries consider this a waste of resources and vehicles."

sprd.617.t:0 "The Ferrol Tiznao"
sprd.617.d:0 "In the spring of 1936, as the political situation of Spain was rapidly deteriorating and the country seemed to be on a course towards civil war, many Spanish military men sought to prepare for such an eventuality even without direct orders from the leadership. After all, if the anarchists and Carlists were preparing, why should the loyalists sit idle, even if the central government of Madrid did not approve every single venture, or so the train of thought went for many local officers and garrison commanders. One place where such a quiet mobilization was the naval town of Ferrol, where the unit commanders of Regimento de Artillería de Costas No.2 decided to prepare for the worst with the creation of an unorthodox but successful armoured addition to their coastal artillery regiment.\n\nThe regiment had a handful of Hispano-Suiza 30/40 buses in their disposal, and using the metallurgical experience of the Ferrol shipbuilders, they transformed these transport mules into true armoured steeds. The Ferrol Armoured Car could be technically classified with the mocking moniker tiznao, often reserved for the metallic abominations produced by the socialists and anarchist militants in Asturias and beyond, but in honesty, the Ferrol transport is a quality machine made by officers and workers who knew what they were doing and had the means for a solid military vehicle. Similar to the smaller Bilbao armoured car, the vehicle has a single Hotchkiss machine gun to defend itself with, but unlike the Bilbao, it also had viewports for passenger weapons.\n\nRoughly seven men could fit inside the machine, besides the gunner, driver and commander, but its primary role was clearly that of a combat armoured car over a specific troop carrier. The regiment, led by commander Sánchez Esperante, managed to create five vehicles before they were discovered, and the vehicles were confiscated for further inspection. While still crude and hastily made, they are far more professionally put together than most other tiznaos seen in Iberia, and there has been serious considerations towards putting them into good use as troop transports, with further provisions made towards making a standardized, truly combat-ready variant of the Ferrol armoured car."

sprd.1101.d:0 "Spain was, regrettably, slow to capitalize on the possibilities offered by the African colonies, and thus the empire only gained some territories in Maghreb and the wayward colony of Equatorial Guinea. When we acquired this small colonial holding from the Portuguese in 1778 as part of the First Treaty of San Ildefonso, many expected Spain to expand further inland, using the small outpost as a launching platform into the heart of the Dark Continent. Yet the long distance to mainland Spain, rough conditions at the area, low number of settlers and the preference of Maghreb as the better colonial holding led to the neglect of Equatorial Guinea and through this, wider Spanish colonies in central Africa. However, some still dreamed of a true Spanish colony in Gabon and Cameroon, though the last of these hopes were shattered when the colonial colossus of Mittelafrika was formed. But now, this gigantic behemoth is at the brink of shattering, and the storm clouds gather in Europe, causing Germany to loosen its greedy grip on the colonies. Perhaps, the time has come to strike, and claim what we once could have had."

With Spain back to its strength and united behind the crown once more, the Spanish Bourbons offer us to join them in dual monarchy, bringing the Bourbons of Spain under one banner once more. Two Sicilies would still keep its local customs, laws and institutions, and Ferdinando III would remain her king, but the two crowns would collaborate on economic, military and foreign policy matters and the empire would share its resources, men and battles equally.

But now, the Americans are tearing one another apart in a horrifying civil conflict, and their imperial holdings in the Pacific and Caribbean are vulnerable, left derelict in the wake of the American collapse. With Spain recovering from the years of strife, many look east, towards the old Spanish East Indies, and many within our nation have begun raising the question: ‘has the time come to reclaim what is rightfully ours?’. They are opposed by the liberals and socialists for the most part, seeing the distance between Spain and Philippines as insurmountable obstacle and the creation of yet another colony as morally abhorrent. Yet even among the liberals there are those hawkish individuals who see the lost colony as a stepping stone to recovering Spain’s lost imperial pride. While there are massive logistical challenges ahead of us if we embark on this reclamation, the will to do so seems to be there to overcome them and reclaim the isles."

But as America spirals into chaos and destroys itself, Cuba is once more adrift, left barely over the water after American capital and industry packs its bags and heads back to the maelstrom that is the American civil war. These news have taken the intellectual and militarist circles of Madrid by storm, and a wave of imperialist fury has caused Spaniards to appeal to the crown and current government to cross the Atlantic Ocean and strike Havana, reclaiming the jewel of the Caribbean and restoring the pride lost to the barbarous Yankees. However, the long distance to the island and the long period of independence of Cuba has enjoyed have caused this imperialist movement to garner its fair share of critics, calling the colonialist dreamers naive and chauvinistic predators. As these two groups bicker over the nobility and righteousness of this colonial venture, the government must come up with its own stance on the matter and silence one of the sides in the debate."

The original French republic may have fallen to the syndicalist menace, and the remnant regime in Algiers become merely an impotent facade of the old order, unable to reclaim even their own lands. However, with Spain’s loyal sons triumphant over the Syndicalist vandals and terrorists, we can set to work on reclaiming France’s lost colonies in Africa and Asia. As the new Franco-Spanish identity settles between our two peoples, we can give the French part of our society back their pride as we reclaim our rightful colonies and soar to ever greater heights. The pretender regimes claiming dominion over Madagascar, Indochina, Cameroon and Gabon will be swept away, and French rule reestablished once more, governed in union with the Spanish loyalists."

Few Spaniards urge caution in this situation, given that it is rather obvious that the revanchist and authoritarian Frenchmen would never join our regime rather than fight to the last to see it toppled.\n\nAs such, preparations are well underway to scorch [NFA.GetName] off the face of the Earth, and to secure true Legitimist rule over all parts of the Empire once more! It is doubtful that the Germans would care to intervene, and we might even receive a momentary ally in the form of the Egyptians, who eye the French possessions hungrily, though any formal alliance is likely impossible."

Some firebrands with Renovacion Espanola have called for Spain to carve out its own Mittelafrika, others yet call for Spain to reclaim the South American colonies by force. Plans such as these are likely results of highly delusional minds, but as the sense of imperial grandeur begins to seep back into the minds of Spaniards, other, less diabolical, ideas have been put forward. One of these imperialist plans is the reclamation of Spanish Netherlands, an area that has not been a part of our empire since the Wars of Spanish Succession. Originally acquired by the Spanish Habsburgs after the split in the main Habsburg family in the mid 1550s, the provinces managed to slip away from Spanish grasp due to domestic weakness and exploitative neighboring powers. Many pacifist leaders, such as Julian Besteiro of PSOE and Angel Pestana of Partido Sindicalista have denounced any such ideas, but the more hawkish members of the Spanish parliament, especially among Accion Popular, Partido Nacionalista Espanola and Partido Radical have supported these ideas. While Netherlands itself is a price all of its own, situated right between the great powers of Europe and boasting a strong navy, its colonial possessions in Asia and the Americas are an even more lucrative price. Still, this venture could easily be considered ridiculous by the international audience, given that Spanish rule was highly contested by the Dutch during our almost two hundred year-long rule. Nonetheless, in this new age of imperialism, perhaps the time is ripe to revive the long-lost province of Spanish Habsburgs."

Last of these was the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, headed by a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, known commonly as the Bourbon-Two Sicilies. This realm was lost during the Italian unification, but the troubles after the Weltkrieg led into the dissolution of Italian unity and the establishment of various splinter states sponsored by the dominant powers of Europe. One of these was the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, reborn as a ad hoc solution to the problem of Italian socialists gaining power. While Ferdinando III, the new king, only reluctantly accepted the position as a temporary solution, in these last two decades, circumstances have led to the kingdom becoming a mainstay of the peninsula. The instability of Spain prevented us from offering more than moral support and officer advisors, but now that Spain is finally relatively stable, we could offer more. Many within the Bourbon noble family have proposed sending an offer of alliance or even the creation of a dual monarchy with our Sicilian brothers, but should Sicilian monarchy fall, there is always the option of simply invading and annexing the tip of the peninsula."

But despite our colonial legacy, a sense of brotherhood still remains among the various Spanish-speaking nations of the world, united by a roughly uniform language and cultural norms brought into the New World by the settlers after its discovery. While we may have our differences and grievances based on historical realities, as the memories of Spanish colonization fade among our South and Central American descendants, Spain is inching closer into the cultural sphere of these nations.\n\nThe ease of communication brought about by the shared values and language has made Spanish companies easier clients than those of our German and Anglo rivals, and even in the deeply depressed state that the world has sunk into, many Spanish companies make profit selling products to our former colonies and vice versa. As such, movements promoting further unity between the world’s various Hispanic peoples have gained traction. Here is Spain, prominent Spanish philologist Ramón Menéndez Pidal has suggested creating a brotherly union with our former colonies, focusing on mutual cooperation and prosperity over Spanish domination of them. These ideas are not without their supporters in the New World either, as famous writers such as Uruguayan poet Juana de Ibarbourou and Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortiz Fernández have promoted Hispanism as an alternative to the United States promotion of Yankee-dominated Pan-Americanism. With our new transition to democratic governance and constitutionalism, many within the New World look up to us as an example of stability and liberty, and thus would most likely be open to an alliance uniting the Hispanic peoples under one common cause."

As Spain and France are now united under one banner, Belgium and to some extent, Netherlands have been noted as possible future conquests. Belgium, while a nation of many different language groups, has a very large French-speaking population, which has led many to argue that it should be part of France altogether, as it should have always been simply a state of France from the beginning. Similarly, many Spaniards have echoed these sentiments, claiming that Spain holds a claim on the territory given our domination of Netherlands, and through them, Belgium, earlier in our history. While these claims are far weaker than those of our French compatriots, the irredentist sentiment has found a lot of support among our more right-wing elements of government and political parties. Organizations like Renovacion Espanola or Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica have called us to launch an immediate invasion, and whatever elements of Action Francaise, that have joined our regime that is, have generally supported this attack. However, there are others who view it as pushing the new union too far, as a war right as we are integrating the former Communard lands could give enough support for the splinter remnants of the Communards to revolt and cause significant issues."

Our dynastic brethren in the south face increased internal pressure from republicans, syndicalists and far-right lunatics like Evola alike, mirroring the issues us Spaniards face on the daily. However, more important than the situation of Bourbon-Two Sicilies is the state of the Papal States, the seat of God’s highest representative on Earth and the very heart of the Catholic church, our strong benefactor. During the Italian collapse, many Spanish volunteers crossed the Mediterranean to fight the northern Red Horde, and partially thanks to the bravery and self-sacrificing nature of these volunteers, the Papacy was saved from those reavers and godless syndicalists.\n\nHowever, as the drums of war once more grow louder on the European continent, the situation of the Papacy grows more dire, and the aforementioned terrible state of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies hardly instills much confidence to the Spanish crown about their ability to defeat the syndicalists should they attempt to install their wretched rule over holy Roma. As such, right-wing conservatives all across Spain, from Christian democrats to Maurists to the traditionalists, integrists and Carlists all call for the Kingdom to take a more direct role in the matters of Rome, to protect the eternal city from atheist invaders and pillagers like we did in 1920s.

Before the French and British collapse, many would-be Agrarians had harboured ideas of purchasing African territories from the French and British to fulfill Isabelline dreams of creating a truly North African colony for Spain in the Maghreb region, but especially following the French collapse, it is clear that the French National State will fight tooth and nail for every bit of sand in the Sahara it owns, and thus peaceful purchase of African land seems to be a pipe dream. However, despite the pacifist program of the Agrarians, some within the party have supported a more aggressive landgrab, arguing that the French National State is little more than a rotting old colonial outpost posing as the legitimate government, and a resurgent Spain with all the might of its armies behind it could easily destroy such a puny remnant.\n\nThe French of course have the military might of the Entente on their side, but it’s debatable whether the Entente would continue a war after a collapse of the French nationalists. As such, we could finally fulfill the Isabelline ambitions of creating a colonial state ranging from the very edge of Atlas mountains in Spanish Rif to the shores of Tunisia.

The French Nationalist State was our ally in the terrible Rif War, but their situation has only deteriorated over time, and now, many Spaniards fear that the collapse of the French nationalists would either invite hordes of Arab and Berber nationalists to contest our small holdings in Rif, or allow Internationale to flood North Africa with syndicalist forces seeking to tear down the colonial order and ‘liberate’ the Maghreb region with their military might. As such, the previously ignored irredentist speeches of Ramón Serrano Suñer, a firebrand nationalist within Juventudes de Accion Popular, have started to gain traction within the party, even despite AP’s relatively non-violent and isolationist stances.\n\nGil-Robles himself has not addressed the matter, but many within AP have increased calls to conquer Algeria and Morocco now that we actually have a chance to do so, to secure these regions so that Berbers or syndicalists cannot do the reverse and cause a much greater headache later. Of course, we would be facing the full might of the Entente, but the French nationalists have hardly any popular support in North Africa and rely on a brutal colonial order to sustain their rump state, meaning that a lightning strike launched from the Rif could likely topple the Algiers regime quickly and most likely cause the Entente to withdraw from the war. However, others argue that we cannot simply go toe-to-toe with one of the major factions of global politics, the French decline notwithstanding, and that such ambitions should just lead to the exclusion of Serrano Suñer from JAP."

These indigenous peoples invited soldiers from the garrison to their village in Tikapa, where they were shown a large collection of Cordoban and Mexican sombreros, Peruvian ponchos, Andalusian horses and Spanish guitars, and were treated to local versions of flamenco and bullfighting. These natives were none other than the Paniora, descendants of a Spanish man by the name of Manuel José de Frutos, born in Segovia in 1811.\n\nDe Frutos arrived to New Zealand on board the whaling ship Elizabeth, belonging to the British whale oil hunters. De Frutos had made a fortune through this work, and given that he was a rather well-known womanizer, he abandoned his ship after being intrigued by the local ladies, hiding from the British searchers under the skirt of one local women according to the tales told by the Paniora. Having escaped his previous commitments, the Spaniards integrated into the tribe Ngāti Porou and continued amassing more wealth thanks to his skills as a merchant. He would go on to marry five local women, Te Herekaipuke, Kataraina, Mihita Heke, Uruhana and Maraea, with whom he would have nine children and forty-one grandchildren.\n\nBy the time of his death in 1873, the Paniora, a Māori word for Spaniard, had become one of the most prominent families in all of New Zealand, and the descendants of de Frutos would continue to synthesize the traditions of the Māori with the traditions of Spain and Latin America, with the grandchildren of de Frutos soon numbering in the thousands. The local soldiers, impressed with the locals’ dedication to Spanish culture, have written back to Spain, asking to empower the Paniora councils to become the new leaders of New Zealand as a balance to the Anglo settlers who have so long abused the rights of the Māori. The new Kingdom of Māori would receive great autonomy within the Spanish empire, and the cultural exchange between this odd and distant yet familiar group of natives and their new Iberian homeland would likely lead to enrichment of both sides."

Their ideology, Popularism, is a mixture of Catholic values and Christian democrat idealism, but refined to the point where they seek to create a society of harmonious communities, where differences in cultures between groups would not be a source of friction but of strength.

However, curiously, as our officers have been mingling with those Nationalist French generals who weren’t too bitter about their loss to not reply to them, they came across general Charles de Gaulle, a well-known French general and a close ally of Marshall Petain. Despite his grievances against our government, he shared many of his military views with our soldiers as many of our generals had fought alongside de Gaulle in the Rif War. Eventually talks turned to politics, and the French general shared that he considered the actions of the Accion Popular government in Spain to be quite inspirational to him in some measure. \n\nMany generals, also members of Accion Popular, wanted to know why this was, and de Gaulle shared his idea of a true French state, one built upon centralization of power, strong personality cult, limited welfare statism and some degree of democracy. As the talks between Accion Popular-aligned generals and de Gaulle continued long into the night, the next day these ideas of de Gaulle were brought to the attention of some Accion Popular politicians who had been in Algiers, creating a new colonial administration. As de Gaulle’s tenets spread among the party elites, some suggested that the party leader, “el Jefe” Gil-Robles, should adopt this ‘Gaullism’ as Accion Popular’s new way of thinking.

This has, obviously, also reached the Spanish academia, who have intermingled with their Italian counterparts, and as many of Izquierda Espanola’s members are educated members of various schools and universities, it was inevitable that the Italians would influence our politicians. By far the strongest influence has been that of Gaetano Salvemini, whose ideology is remarkably close to that of Manuel Azaña, promoting strong, anti-clerical republicanism as a means to curtail the radicalism of left and right-wing extremists while still enacting very radical reforms that would transform Italian society to be more equal, free and fair, without the need for tyranny or ignorance.

sprd.1156.d:0 "When the Communard revolution in France succeeded right after the Weltkrieg, the Spanish population was sent into a frenzy of fear, seeing syndicalist infiltrators around every corner. As CNT-FAI resistance grew bolder, many other groups also began to harbour traitorous thoughts. The Catalans had been a thorn in our side for quite some time, but the years of pistolerismo and Spain’s defeats in Rif War made their rebellion a very possible reality in Catalonia. After Primo de Rivera’s coup d’etat succeeded, one of his very first actions was to crack down on Catalan parties and regionalist organizations, even those that had previously supported Spanish rule, such as Liga Regionalista. Basque and Galician regionalists weren’t spared either, accused of being supported by the French to stir up trouble in Spain. Ironically, this persecution of Spain’s minorities drove them to accept help from the Communards, and despite our best efforts, regionalist and separatist parties are still under suspicion of sending volunteers to train in Southern France. Regionalism, especially in relation to the deeply centralist line adopted by the military after the Sanjurjada coup, has been on the rise, and even regions with relatively docile nationalist movements, such as Andalusia and Asturias, have been boldened by the rhetoric of their Basque, Catalan and Galician comrades."

sprd.1157.t:0 "Resurgence of Regionalism"
sprd.1157.d:0 "Spanish regionalism stems from the very varied demographics of our nation, with many regions of Spain having their own cultural quirks, traditions and in the case of Basques, Catalans, Galicians and Asturians, among others, their own languages. Especially with the Basques, this difference is stark, as these hardy people have lived in the Pyrenean mountains for millenia, forming a culture and language that is in many ways, completely alien to that of other European peoples. Yet despite these marked differences, Basques are among the most devout Catholics in Iberia and have taken part in various ventures of greater Spain during the centuries, and over the last century, Spanish immigrants have seriously started to become a major demographic in the Basque territories. Similar thing has happened in Catalonia, where the industrial city of Barcelona has drawn in quite a bit of Spanish immigrants, often prompting violent clashes between Spanish and Catalan nationalists. Catalans have long considered themselves separate from Spain, and as a hive of anarchism and ultranationalism, the region continues to cause grey hairs for Spanish administrators and soldiers alike. Compared to Basques and Catalans, Galicians remain a relatively aloof people, not particularly bothered with nationalism, though as the situation in Spain deteriorates, many more have been goaded into joining various nationalist Galician parties in order to abandon the sinking ship of Castile."

sprd.1158.d:0 "Basque nationalism was pioneered by Sabino Arana in the late 19th century, and his political party, Partido Nacionalista Vasco, is among the oldest parties in Spain. Promoting regionalism, Basque nationalism and traditionalism without monarchism, the party always aimed to create a free Basque republic, Euskadi, separating from Spain fully. However, after a split in the party leadership, the traditionalists and ultranationalists began to lose ground to the more moderate, Christian democratic faction, which during the republican years ditched the traditional PNV allies, Carlists, to join the left-wing republican coalition in pursuit of autonomy for the Basque country. \n\nWhile the republic died, the party was repressed and has since radicalized to adopt more of their nationalist outlooks, recruiting militants into its mountaineering organization. Basque region also houses a considerable amount of Carlists, and their stronghold, Pamplona, has long been a hive of vipers seeking to topple the rightful rule of the Alfonsists. Basque country is mainly dominated by PNV, thought Acción Nacionalista Vasca, a more left-wing party, has recently emerged to challenge PNV’s hegemony, while still remaining just as staunchly nationalistic. Cells of the Communist Party of Euskadi also remain in the territory, supported by French Jacobins, though their relevance is thankfully small."

Catalan democratic parties, such as Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, Acció Catalana Republicana and Unión Democrática de Cataluña have also been caught promoting Catalan nationalism, and the leader of the radicalized youth section of ERC, Josep Dencàs, has even been accused of being a National Syndicalist. \n\nHowever, while the democrats are enough of a headache, they pale in comparison to the terrorists of Nosaltres Sols! and Estat Catala, two radical groups of ultranationalists engaging in political assassinations, bombings and hit and run attacks against the police. Nosaltres Sols! also contains a Sorelian wing, Moviment Nacionalista Totalitari, known for being in league with Valois and his Totalists. In addition to the ultranationalists, socialist and communist groups such as Partit Català Proletari and Unió Socialista de Catalunya have been known to organize strikes and sabotage to hamper our rule, motivated just as much by Catalan nationalism as they are by Marxist and syndicalist ideals."

sprd.1160.d:0 "Members of the Spanish crown have approached us today, discussing the possible sale of their lands in North Africa. In 1898, after Spain had lost its war against the United States and lost its colonies in the Caribbean and Asia, Spain attempted to sell their colony of Rio de Oro, a small strip of land in southern Morocco, to Austria-Hungarian empire. The Austrian crown was interested in this purchase, having stayed out of the scramble for Africa, but the Hungarian side of the dual monarchy blocked the purchase. Now that the situation has developed further, and Hungary has more pressing gains to be made on other matters, it could be possible to purchase this land from Spain. The price is hardly an issue, as Spain mainly intends this sale to be a show of goodwill now that they are part of our alliance, but many fear that the empire will overstretch itself if it seeks territories in Africa in addition to its considerable holdings in mainland Europe."

sprd.1161.d:0 "Compared to Catalans and Basques, the Galicians haven’t given us too much trouble just yet, though the rising nationalism of that region is troubling. Galicia never developed into a industrial powerhouse unlike Bilbao or Barcelona, and thus while the region has been active politically, it hasn’t been as radicalized by Spanish immigrants as Basques and Catalans have. However, a small group of Galician nationalists, Irmandades da Fala, started the development towards a more nationalist approach to Galicianism, and while the group still exists, it has been superceded by Partido Galeguista as the leader of Galician nationalism. \n\nWhen the republic was proclaimed in 1931, Galicians even went as far as to declare the independence of an independent Galician republic, which merely lasted a day before quietly reintegrating back into Spain proper. However, years have radicalized Galicianism, and new parties such as Vangarda Nazonalista Galega have pushed radical Galician nationalism even further. Some Galicianists advocate for an independent state, while others push for a federal union with Portugal too, given the alleged Celtic heritage of Galicians. There are even more radical followers of Galicianism too, such as Vicente Risco, a known esotericist, influenced by such extremist ideologies such as the Austrian Ariosophy. The harsh repression has pushed even moderate Galicianists, who during the republic pushed for a federalized Spain, such as ORGA party, into open defiance towards Madrid. While Galicia may not be the powder keg that Catalonia is, we must keep an eye on the developments of the region."

Workers from CNT-FAI and UGT organized a strike of great magnitude and the military response to this insubordination of national duty led the Asturians into a proper uprising.  The uprising leadership, made up of socialist Belarmino Tomás and the syndicalists Segundo Blanco and Amador Fernández, proclaimed itself the Sovereign Council of Asturias and León. While short-lived and bereft of any international support besides a small volunteer cadre from Third Internationale, it marked the first appearance for a concentrated Asturian state in the 20th century. \n\nAfter the rising, the Madrid government was quick to crack down on any sentiments of independence or even simple regionalism in the region, and institutions or individuals promoting the Asturian language were destroyed or executed for treason. However, a fire yet burns in the hearts of Asturians, and unless we act decisively against this insidious threat, they may attempt another uprising in the future."

sprd.1163.d:0 "In the future, the event known as Sanjurjada may very well be regarded as the defining moment of the 1930s in Spain, given its impact on the nation in a very similar way to the 1923 coup by Miguel Primo de Rivera. The coup, led by general Jose Sanjurjo, leader of the Guardia Civil police force, was heavily sponsored by the German Kaiserreich and French National State in Algiers, who had observed the proclamation of the republican regime with disinterest until the republicans aligned with Spain’s socialists. Fearing a socialist takeover and the inclusion of Spain into the Third Internationale, the Kaiserreich sent both material and economic support for the plotters, while the French forces were even prepared to offer direct intervention. With the red scare overtaking Spain, the leadership of Accion Popular, especially its rising star Jose Maria Gil-Robles, aligned with the coup leadership, and even the Carlists offered support in the form of their Requete militias.\n\nWhile the coup’s military support was rather low, its financial backing by foreign powers and a sudden endorsement by the exiled king Alfonso XIII led to a lightning success when Guardia Civil managed to overthrow government rule in Madrid. Riots broke out all over Spain and anarchist militias rose up in Catalonia, prompting even those military officers who had not been on the side of the plotters to join the fighting. With the republicans in shambles after the loss of Madrid and the rapid endorsement of Sanjurjo’s regime by both the French nationalists and Reichspakt, the Republicans could do little but escape to friendly countries. The Internationale, almost on the brink of intervention in Catalonia, was too slow to react and could only watch in horror as their potential ally in Iberia turned back towards reactionary monarchism. The coup leadership installed Accion Popular as the civilian government, though heavily controlled by the military, and Alfonso XIII was restored to the throne of Spain in a brief ceremony. The Carlists, who had hoped for the military to support their claimant instead due to the support of the Requetes during the coup, became increasingly radicalized by the betrayal, and promising talks between Carlists and Alfonsists that had happened before the coup became an impossibility once more ."

sprd.1164.d:0 "The anarchists of CNT-FAI managed to drum up enough support for a wide-scale battle against the military in Catalonia, but due to the quick efforts of both the ruling commander of Barcelona, Dominique Batet, and the organization of anti-anarchist militias in the form of Carlist Sindicatos Libres, the anarchists found their offense stalling, and the arrival of military reinforcements forced the CNT-FAI militants into hiding once more. Another uprising against the military would be attempted in 1934, when the miners of Asturias rose up in opposition to the government’s increasingly harsh policies towards the proletariat, and a short-lived Sovereign Council of Asturias was proclaimed. The anarchists of CNT-FAI were quick in taking advantage of this rising, and similar uprisings happened in Catalonia, Andalusia and the Biscayan coast, in addition to terror bombings, assassinations and the firebombing of military barracks and Catholic convents.\n\nThese uprisings were brutally crushed, and the resulting crackdowns almost caused CNT-FAI to fade from Spanish politics, causing the emergence of a moderate wing of the movement. These moderates, led by figures such as Salvador Segui, Ángel Pestaña and Juan López Sánchez, pushed for the abandonment of violent action, and instead advocated for continued use of strikes, even at general level, as well as the biding of time until the regime would inevitable collapse upon itself. Some, like Ángel Pestaña, even proposed that when elections would be restored, CNT-FAI should transition into a proper political parties, seeking change through political reform rather than revolutionary action. The moderates, while still a minority, are increasingly gaining ground inside CNT-FAI as the violent actions seem to only lead to more misery among its supporters after harsh reprisals, which in turn lead to increased apathy among them. Yet should our regime commit mistakes in handling the anarchists, the radical wing of CNT-FAI is still very much strong enough to start another rebellion to achieve their revolutionary ideas."

sprd.1165.d:0 "In the aftermath of Sanjurjada, the military issued a country-wide purge of Republican leaders, party members and military officers aligned with Republican ideas. In weeks, most of Spain’s republicans had either been killed, imprisoned or exiled, some being forced into the colonies of Rif, Sahara and Equatorial Guinea to avoid the possibility of a counter-coup. Officers known for sympathizing with the Republic’s cause, such as Gonzales Quiepo de Llano and Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer, were posted in remote places like Canary Islands or Guinea for this reason as well. Many republicans sought refuge in America, fleeing either to the United States or the republics of South and Central America.\n\nMany Galician republicans settled in Cuba as well. The most left-leaning republicans found shelter in the Third Internationale, while for the most right-leaning members Austria, Germany or other European states turned out to be the easiest option. Global reactions to the coup varied, with many Hispanic democracies decrying it as a clear military intervention in democratic process and destruction of the Spanish dream for liberty. United States and Russia denounced the coup as reactionary installation of a dictatorship, while Reichspakt, Austria and Entente were either ambivalent or supportive of the regime and at best considered the republicans naive collaborators of the Internationale."

Georgian and Spanish historians have mentioned the situation as somewhat comedic, given that the Iberians now hold land in the territory of the former Kingdom of Iberia, a state which existed from late Antiquity to the beginnings of the Early Middle Ages, usually as part of a larger empire but at times as an independent entity as well. Kingdom of Iberia, as it was known in ancient Greek, or Hiberia as it was in turn known in Latin, was ruled by various ruling dynasties, such as Pharnavazid, Chosroid and Arsacid dynasties.\n\nThe small kingdom which spanned most of modern south Georgia and parts of Armenia and Turkey would eventually merge with the other local kingdom, Kingdom of Kolchis, which led to the creation of the Kingdom of Georgia and the slow transformation of the Iberians into what is today known as the Kartvelians, modern Georgians. The Kingdom of Georgia was ruled by the Bagrationi dynasty for a long period of time, and members of the dynasty still exist today, with the royal house led by Giorgi Bagration-Mukhraneli today.

The right-wing parties that have frequently collaborated with the monarchy have all gathered in the Cortes, alongside the king himself and his closest advisors and aides. Few expected there to be a drastic shift in the governance of Spain as it currently stands, as Accion Popular has held the reins of power since 1932. However, the public opinion towards them has soured, and there are rumours that the king and military view the party with increased disdain for their failures to reform the state and avoid the separatist uprising.\n\nAs such, while the citadel of Accion Popular suppressed the strength of other right-wing parties for nearly half a decade, it seems that the time has come for them to be replaced, though it’s just as likely that the rumours could be false and AP retains its governmental position. However, should the incumbent party be dislodged from its position, there are three likely rivals that could take its place. The most likely replacement is the Unión Monárquica Nacional, a neo-conservative party originally formed in 1930 to support the monarchy before the republican proclamation, and the party collapsed shortly after, returning after the Sanjurjada to support the military. Led by the rising stars of Spain’s right, such as Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera and Santiago Fuentes Pila, the party is outwardly monarchist but also represents the interests of the military as much of its support comes from monarchist officers and the clique of general Sanjurjo. Less likely to win but still considerably strong are the resurrected Partido Liberal-Fusionista, with the Liberal dropped from the name to appease the other parties. \n\nPartido Fusionista is little more than a collection former Restoration era liberals and moderate conservatives serving the caciquist machine of its leader, Count of Romanones Álvaro de Figueroa y Torres. Remaining as one of the last nominal liberals to align with the regime, the Count’s closeness to the old king Alfonso XIII and his family has made him invulnerable to persecution even to the anti-liberal forces currently ruling Spain. However, calling the Count a liberal is hardly accurate, as he represents the political system of the Restoration era, the festering corruption, cronyism and grift. In stark contrast to the Fusionists is the Acción Española, a cultural organization of Spanish ultra-conservatives, integralists and social Catholics who wish to create a Spain modelled somewhat after the Lusitanian model, though with a far greater emphasis on the idea of Hispanidad, the inherent nature and qualities of Spaniards, and how these contrast with the perfidious separatists.

One of the simplest is the lack of funds, as colonial ventures are notoriously expensive. Now, we could of course just raise taxes or simply stop expanding, but given the recent uptick in nationalist fervour, this would likely be quite unpopular, and while the colonies are expected to be profitable, these profits will take a while to start mounting up, just as they did with our colony of Rif after we captured said territory and got its iron mines up and running. But while Rif is quite profitable thanks to its iron ore, its counterpart on the other side of Morocco proper, Rio de Oro, has not been nearly as great of a venture. In fact, back in 1898, right after our humiliating defeat at the hands of the Yanks, the crown attempted to sell it Austria, but this was blocked by the other part of Austria-Hungary’s dual monarchy, the Hungarians. Now, however, reports have come in that Austrians would be willing to renegotiate this deal, and in exchange for a foothold in Africa, they would offer us funds to fuel our colonial ventures. While this would mean giving away yet another of our few colonies, it would be given to an ally of ours and quite frankly, the territory of Rio de Oro is not that important to the Spaniards.

Bits and pieces remained here and there, such as the Islas Carolinas island chain in Micronesia, but with the loss of Philippines, the Spanish East Indies project was thoroughly dead. Humbled by its defeat and in dire straits economically due to war debts and the loss of the lucrative Cuban sugar trade, Spain was forced to sell the island chain to Germany, who had sought control of it decades earlier.\n\nHowever, the islands were first discovered by Spanish explorer Toribio Alonso de Salazar, and the islands remained under Spain for centuries, their ownership only coming to question in1885 as Germany and United Kingdom protested our rightful establishment of a local customs office. The ensuing crisis with Germany over the ownership of the islands was then resolved by the Holy See, and Germany was given access to a naval facility on the island chain to utilize as a naval base, something they never did. Even after the sale of these islands, Germany has hardly developed them at all, and the occupation of the islands by Japan and the ensuing retaking of them by the German forces at the end of the Weltkrieg did a degree of damage to local infrastructure.\n\nIt is clear that Germany holds these lands for little purpose, and with their recent economic woes, it could be possible for Spain to purchase this islands back. Islas Carolinas themselves are not particularly impressive as far as colonial holdings go, but they could serve as a starting point to our return to Asian waters, acting as a springboard towards retaking Philippines now that the Americans are falling into internal strife and disarray.

The Spanish ambassador to Berlin has proposed that the sale of these islands, originally sold by Spain to Germany in the end of the 1800s, would be reversed. Spain is offering to buy the islands back for the same sum that the German empire originally bought them for, which normally would be a laughable proposition, but the Spaniards have also offered to help defend the Pacific threat from possible Japanese threats.

A popular suggestion drawing from the Spanish adoration for the Austrian empire is to adopt a flag in the style of Austria-Hungary, depicting the coat of arms of both nations. Another common suggestion is one merging the most striking symbols of both nations’ authoritarian monarchists, with Spain readopting the Burgundian Cross as the Carlists no longer hold any ownership over it, while the Portuguese part of the empire would be represented by the Order of Christ cross. Finally, perhaps the most extravagant suggestion is a flag combining the Burgundian Cross, merged coat of arms of Portugal and Spain, Order of Christ Cross and the Cross of Santiago on a white and blue background."

While the king is not particularly pleased with such ideas, many view it as a strong signal to outside forces that PNE is now the sole commander of Spain and shall be so for as long as the party can affect that. The new flag would keep the militant eagle and Cross of Santiago, strong symbols of the party, but change the dual colours of Spain for a singular mono-colour one, with a Burgundian style cross positioned behind the eagle to show the traditionalist roots of the party and its harmony with the Carlists.

As such, suggestions on how to improve the design and truly represent the magnitude of our crusade have arrived to the Royal Palace, and now, work has begun to choose a new representation of the resurgent Holy Roman Empire. The option to keep the current flag is always on the table, but should the king desire a change, another option would be to adopt a slightly modified double-headed eagle with the Holy Roman coat of arms. Many view this as too detached from its Spanish roots, and suggest adding a Burgundian cross to represent the Hispanic spirit and imperial Spanish roots, while keeping the traditional yellow of Holy Roman Empire. Others have suggested a return to truly Spanish colours by replacing the yellow with white, but perhaps the most radical departure would be to adopt the black and yellow design, to proclaim our challenge to the Austrian Habsburgs as the true successors of Holy Roman Empire."

The Guinean territories of Río Muni and Fernando Pó offer little, but are key political relics and proof of Spain's imperial standing. Their continued development allows mother Spain to present herself as a great power even as the mainland sinks into financial decay.\n\nIt is no Cuba, but it is something, and our pacification campaigns - which ended only a few years ago - have won some economic benefits. With a new year approaching the situation is becoming increasingly chaotic, both in the colonies and at home. The metropolis is suffering from social upheaval which we have not seen in a century, and even the colonial administration is divided between monarchists, republicans, socialists and adherents to the Carlist cause.\n\nThe Moroccans and their German masters eye our gains greedily, the French government-in-exile perhaps even more so.

After the Spanish killed around fifteen thousand Bubi to quell the uprising, Malabo was forced into condemning it, damaging his reputation irreparably.\n\nKing Malabo spent the rest of his life, like the rest of his people, as a marginal force, and he ended up drinking himself to an early grave. Alcoholism is still rife in much of West Africa, and despite efforts by missionaries to stem the flow of spirits, its influence is rife virtually everywhere.\n\nThe throne of the Bubi kingdom now seemingly falls to Malabo's son, Alobari, or Francisco Malabo Beosá, who has renamed himself Malabo - becoming Malabo II and the traditional ruler of Fernando Pó."

Now a scandal has broken after company documents were leaked to a journalist in Spain, leading to revelations about bribery and murder stemming from an aborted attempt by the ALENA board of directors to jack up the price of shipping in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nThe scandal has reached such heights that even the Madrid government is contemplating intervening, with ALENA's many interests in the colonies and at home at risk.

The support of the German government was assured after a massive campaign in the Berlin press, and when the lustre of imperial projects had yet to cool.\n\nThough prohibitively expensive, the exercise has apparently paid off as the ship is, for better or worse, afloat once more, almost forty years after it was laid down and over twenty since it was sunk."

This is accurate, for some Creoles - the descendants of slaves, Liberians and Nigerians - have become landowners in their own right, while the Bubi remain mostly impoverished.\n\nFernando Pó was discovered in around 1471 by Fernao da Pó and the Portuguese established slave camps on the island, which the Bubi fought against en-masse despite being devastated by European illnesses.\nIn 1797 the island was traded to the Spanish, who in turn allowed the British to use Pó as a base for the anti-slavery West Africa Squadron.\n\nIn 1858 Spanish colonisation began in full, and with the help of Cuban exiles the island's plantation economy began to flourish. In the Weltkrieg German forces from Kamerun fled to the island, with the pro-German governor-general Barrera wisely supporting the winning side.\n\nEver since Fernando Pó has existed in a world almost of its own, a leading agricultural hub but still isolated from much of the world economy despite German inroads."

sprd.3003.t:0 "The Successor of Spain’s Greatest Republican"
sprd.3003.d:0 "The entire freedom-loving Spain mourns the death of the republican titan, Manuel Azaña Díaz, who during the long years of exile never wavered in the fight towards freedom, but even such a beacon of Iberian democracy could not resist the decay of age. As his final rites are being organized by family members and party associates, with even the royal family uncharacteristically pitching in to provide various accessories and relics for the funeral, Izquierda Española has gathered to determine a new leader to succeed the ‘Monster’, as Azaña was affectionately known among his followers and less affectionately among his many enemies.\n\nThe first and most supported option is José Giral y Pereira, one of Azaña’s closest allies and the man who supported him throughout all the trials and tribulations the 1930s threw at Azaña. Pereira is more moderate compared to his mentor, but still possesses the same fire as Azaña and his knowledge of Spanish politics has made him one of the leading members of IE. Another option would be to nominate Augusto Barcia Trelles, a Galician liberal with a highly Europeanist and modernist stint to his governance. His popularity among the minority peoples of Spain would make him an excellent candidate to renew our alliances with parties like Partido Galeguista and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya.\n\nFinally, IE could also nominate the former leader of Partido Republicano Radical Socialista Independiente, Álvaro de Albornoz Liminiana, who is considerably more radical in his policies than the other two options and has spent most of his life fighting for an equal and just republic. His policies veer to liberal socialism, which could further attract workers and moderate socialists to the party, though many centrists of the party view him with suspicion given his very left-wing alignment."
sprd.3003.a:0 "Pereira is the logical choice."
sprd.3003.b:0 "Barcia Trelles will bring modernity to Spain."
sprd.3003.c:0 "De Albornoz will relit Azaña’s fire in the party."

sprd.3004.t:0 "Dreams of Retirement"
sprd.3004.d:0 "From president of the Spanish republic to his position as the prime minister of the resurrected Kingdom of Spain, Niceto Alcalá-Zamora seems to have gone through it all. While he has been a stalwart defender of the law and democratic principles, age is starting to creep up on him, and the man responsible in part of bridging the near impossible gap between the Spanish monarchists and republicans has found himself dreaming more and more about retirement, to live out the rest of his days without the squabbling of partisans under his rule.\n\nHe is not too old to rule, and Alcalá-Zamora may remain in charge out of a sense of duty to his cause, but the prime minister has already planned his successors in case he ever decides to step down. First option is the conservative prodigal son and former leader of Partido Conservador from the powerful Maura family, Miguel Maura y Gamazo. Maura is less liberal than Alcalá-Zamora but his commitment to the defense of democracy above all else is a virtue both men share.\n\nAnother option for Alcalá-Zamora would be able to be pursued through a family link, that being the prime minister’s son Niceto Alcalá-Zamora Castillo. Niceto Junior recently married Ernestina Queipo de Llano, daughter of general and famed republican Gonzalo Queipo de Llano y Sierra. Quiepo de Llano has always been a great admirer of the prime minister, and after the two families became linked through their young, Queipo de Llano has officially joined Derecha Liberal. While notably more authoritarian and prone to displays of extravagance, Queipo de Llano does possess far more influence within the military than either Alcalá-Zamora or Maura, and his links to republicans both from the left and right make him a rather effective politician when it comes to maneuvering the deep web of intrigue that is the Spanish political scene."
sprd.3004.a:0 "Alcalá-Zamora remains in charge!"
sprd.3004.b:0 "Mauristas rise to rule once more!"
sprd.3004.c:0 "Queipo de Llano will lead Spain with an iron grip!"

sprd.3005.t:0 "Fatigue and Fatherhood"
sprd.3005.d:0 "The venerable leader of Acción Popular, Jose Maria Gil-Robles, embodies the party as much as one man can, pushing for the eventual victory of social Catholicism from the dark days of 1932 all the way to the return to democracy in the last elections, and while the party has had to adopt many faces and roles, Gil-Robles has remained its stalwart guardian. However, even he is not immune to the rigours of governance, and the long days and nights brokering deals, signing agreements and negotiating with other politicians have started to take a toll on his well-being.\n\nIn addition to these work-induced bouts of stress and fatigue, there is the ever-present threat of assassinations or other attacks upon Gil-Robles or his immediate family, and as a father of young children he is all too aware that he has more at stake than just his life. As such, seeing their Jefe visibly suffer from the burden of leading Spain, many have urged the man to retire from politics for a time, to rest and recover, as his role in leading Spain out of the recent crisis was one not to be taken lightly. Should Gil-Robles retire, it is very likely that the moderate wing of the party would see two of the big names within it take over Acción Popular. Manuel Giménez Fernández, the infamous White Bolshevik, reformer of the party and a good personal friend of Gil-Robles is the most likely successor, much to the chagrin of the extreme right of AP, and his reign would likely see the party become a truly Christian democratic, highly socially conscious and outright progressive conservative movement.\n\nA more traditional candidate, still from the liberal wing of AP, would be Luis Lucia Lucia, leader of the Derecha Regional Valenciana. His platform would likely introduce a far more autonomist line to the party, promoting regionalist alliances with AP and directing the movement towards Christian democracy not too dissimilar to that promoted by the Basque nationalist Partido Nacionalista Vasco. Lucia Lucia is not as radical as Giménez but still a very true reformer, and many fear that the party may fracture further under such reformist individuals."
sprd.3005.a:0 "Gil-Robles retains his leadership position, delegating a bit more power to his underlings."
sprd.3005.b:0 "Giménez takes the lead and brings true utopian conservatism to Spain."
sprd.3005.c:0 "Lucia Lucia purges the centralists and brings modern Christian democracy to AP."

sprd.3006.t:0 "A Burning Heart in a Frail Body"
sprd.3006.d:0 "With Partido Sindicalista’s victory in elections, Ángel Pestaña’s meteoric rise to lead Spain’s political syndicalists has not seen a single slump on its way, but it is clear that ever since the young syndicalist rose to lead CNT-FAI in 1934, his physical health has deteriorated further. Few claim that Pestaña does not possess the necessarily tools to lead, in fact it is his capability as a speaker and alliance broker that earned him the position he now resides in, but his body has never been the most robust and Pestaña finds himself in need of rest far more often now that the burden of leadership wears him down as well.\n\nAs such, the doctors working on keeping his health in check have recommended that at minimum, the prime minister should slow down his working pace and divert some of his work to other members of the party, but to actually fix the problem, he should appoint a temporary successor until next elections and actually retreat from political positions until his underlying health issues have been dealt with. If Pestaña were to retire, the choice of a successor would be a tough one. There are technically numerous allies of his that could take the position, such as Salvador Seguí, Juan Peiró and Juan López Sánchez, but these possibilists are all involved in union work in their respective territories and are not interested in pursuing political positions at the moment. However, close allies of the prime minister have suggested that he utilizes the new allies of Partido Sindicalista, freshly integrated into the movement, to lead temporarily, making them less likely to break away from the common syndicalist fight.\n\nThis would likely see Lucía Sánchez Saornil, the feminist intellectual and one of the leaders of Mujeres Libres, take the reins, driving forward a new possibilist direction that better incorporates the struggle of women into its political program. Election of Sánchez Saornil as the first prime minister of Spain would once and for all alleviate any criticism of PS not taking the ideas of feminism seriously. However, a more radical choice is to appoint Joaquín Maurín as the new prime minister. While a communist syndicalist is an unorthodox choice for an anarchist movement, Maurín’s wide reach and strong alliances to other republican groups would make him a well-rounded leader, and it would cause PSOE to lose some of its left-wing members to Partido Sindicalista."
sprd.3006.a:0 "Pestaña follows the doctors’ advice and lowers his workload."
sprd.3006.c:0 "Pestaña steps down and Sánchez Saorni brings democratic syndicalist feminism to Spain."
sprd.3006.b:0 "Maurín is appointed as the next Spanish prime minister, shocking the nation."


sprd.3007.t:0 "The Caudillo Retires, and Another One Rises in His Place"
sprd.3007.d:0 "In yet another surprise proclamation, General Sanjurjo has announced his near immediate withdrawal from his position as the Caudillo of Spain, citing old age and desire to live the rest of his day away from office as the reasons. The successor to the beloved Caudillo of Spain is yet not known, but the press speculates that despite the numerous capable military men, four are the most likely followers to Sanjurjo’s legacy. The most likely is general Damaso Berenguer, a man who led the so-called dictablanda, a soft dictatorship which directly led to the proclamation of the Second Spanish republic. Berenguer is a career military man and an Africanist officer like Sanjurjo, and follows the same relatively lax policies as the Caudillo did, staying away from using the military and Guardia Civil as the iron fist of the state and delegating power to civilians whenever he can. Second option is Wencelas Benitez Inglott, an admiral of the Spanish navy who, despite his old age, is a man of great capability.\n\nRumoured to be the best scientist in the Spanish military, he was the captain of Spain’s first aircraft carrier and led an admirable career of scientific and military research. He is also a fierce monarchist and coordinated the escape of the royal family from Spain prior to the proclamation of the republic. Third option is one of symbolic continuity, as Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer, another officer of Guardia Civil, has become a close ally of Sanjurjo despite his republican sympathies, and would follow a far more reformist line than the rest of the candidates, as he is also a member of Partido Radical. Finally, a dark horse candidate but another member of the old guard is Severiano Martínez Anido, man known for his cruel and ruthless nature, who will stop at nothing to destroy Spain’s enemies, evident with his handling of CNT-FAI during the years of pistolerismo. His reign would hardly follow the tenets of Sanjurjo, and it is unlikely that he will win the Caudillo’s favour, but his stubborn nature may just allow him to power on through to victory over his rivals and get a seat as the iron surgeon of Spain."
sprd.3007.b:0 "Berenguer will renew the ideas of Dictablanda once more.."
sprd.3007.c:0 "Benitez brings scientific governance to Spain."
sprd.3007.e:0 "Cabanellas Ferrer modernizes the military’s grip on Spain."
sprd.3007.c:0 "Martínez Anido crushes any and all opposition on the path to victory."

sprd.3008.t:0 "A Lone Gunman"
sprd.3008.d:0 "Despite all the political achievements and improvements to the lives of Spanish peoples that Unión Española has been able to push through during their time in office, there are still those grumbling at the changes and direction that Spain has taken. Many within the extreme right and left see Spain headed for a direction that is a complete anathema to their ideological thinking, and while groups like the Carlist Comunión Tradicionalista and the Izqueirda Comunista are completely politically irrelevant, they still possess the means to strike at individual politicians and members of the regime. There has been numerous threats of violence towards the prime minister Diego Martínez Barrio, but thus far no actual violence has been directed at him, though this changed today.\n\nA lone gunman fired at the vehicle of Martínez Barrio as he was headed for a session within the halls of the Cortes, with eleven bullets striking the car. The accompanying police escort was quick to dismount and open fire towards the assailant, who was killed on the spot from the police revolvers. The body bore the markings of a Carlist Requeté, making it rather obvious that it was an attack carried out by the radicalized youth section of the Communion, presumably because of the liberal policies of Martínez Barrio. The prime minister’s car, having been hit multiple times to the cabin and tyres, had veered off course, stopping finally upon hitting a hedge at the side of the road. The police officers feared the worst as they approached the car, still smoking from the crash, and as the doors of the vehicle were opened, the prime minister was...."
sprd.3008.b:0 "... found in good health, the bullets having missed him and the driver."
sprd.3008.c:0 "... in critical condition, with the police rushing him to the nearest hospital."

### Leader Bios ###s
NOR_PRINCE_CARL_DESC:0 "Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland, is the current Viceroy of Norway. He is the representative of his brother, King Gustaf V of Sweden and Norway."
POLITICS_Albin_Eines_DESC:0 "Born on 9 June 1886 in Trondheim, half-Swedish Albin Eines trained as a bookbinder and typographer in Sweden, where he became a member of the Socialist Party led by Zeth Höglund. An opponent of Martin Tranmæl's parliamentarian policy, he reluctantly joined the NKP despite an initial scepticism to Communist ideas. Gradually becoming head of the party's publishing organs, he gradually moved towards nationalism and socialist centralism, finding himself inspired by the ideas of Sorel and his heirs. \n\n With the passage of the Totalist Charter, Eines at last found his ideological bearings and has eagerly begun to promote a new National Syndicalist vision for Norway."
POLITICS_Martin_Tranmel_DESC:0 "Martin Tranmæl was born on 27 June 1879 to a working class family in Sør-Trøndelag county. Emigrating to the United States at the start of the century, he joined the AFL and was present at the founding congress of the IWW, whose revolutionary syndicalist ideology proved influential on his future beliefs. Having come to lead the militant Left of the Norwegian Labour Party on his return from the United States, Tranmæl eagerly followed the events in both Russia and later France. Following the triumph of Syndicalism in France and Britain, Tranmæl continued to advocate for strike action and agitate for workers rights. Though the leading man in what some have come to call the \"Tranmæl party\", recent years have seen Tranmæl adopt a more reformist and parliamentarian line. Only time will tell if this approach will bring the Socialists to victory or see the leading man of the Left displaced in favour of more radical politicians."
POLITICS_Haakon_VII_DESC:0 "After Norway secured its independence from Sweden in 1905, prince Carl of Denmark was asked to become king of the newly independent nation. Known to be a strong proponent of Democracy, the prince only accepted the throne after he was legitimised by plebiscite, adopting the regnal name Haakon, formerly used by the Norwegian kings of old.\n\nIn more recent years, Norway's perceived support for the Entente during the Weltkrieg has pushed it into diplomatic and economic isolation, resulting in an increased growth of the socialist movement. Despite being respected and supported by the Norwegian people, and his declaration in 1928 that he is also the king of the syndicalists, this republican movement renders Haakon's position anything but secure."
POLITICS_Vidkun_Quisling_DESC:0 "Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonssøn Quisling was born on July 18, 1887 in Fyresdal. Son of a pastor of the Church of Norway, Vidkun Quisling began his career in the General Staff of the Norwegian Army, then traveled throughout Europe in the 1920s. During this period, he contributed to several humanitarian projects, but was horrified by the Syndicalist revolutions which erupted over all over Western Europe. Returning home to Norway, he saw the rising popularity of socialist parties. Determined to prevent his beloved country from falling into the hands of the Reds, he founded the Nasjonal Samling in 1933, a populist nationalist organization which split into two factions, a reactionary one more favourable to the monarchy and a populist one calling for Germanic morality and replacing the decadent monarchy with Quisling as the Fører. \n\n After the Socialists' victory in the 1936 election, Quisling was compelled to intervene to save Norway. Now wielding the power necessary to restore Greater Norway, Quisling and his people look forward to a radiant future."
POLITICS_Stein_Barth_Heyerdahl_DESC:0 "Born on 12 July 1909 in Sandnessjøen, Stein Barth-Heyerdahl was active in the scouting movement and an early convert to right-wing thought. Coming into contact with the racial doctrines of Erling Winsnes during his time at gymnasium, he also made the acquittance of a young Per Imerslund. Moving to Oslo to study law, he became part of the circle around Eugen Nielsen, embracing neo-Pagan believes and openly breaking with Lutheranism. Rapidly rising to the top as a leader of the nationalist youth, he gained a reputation as a passionate speaker and for leading his fellows into battle with the Socialists. \n\n Though present at the founding meeting of the Nasjonal Samling his neo-Pagan ideas quickly brought him into conflict with Quisling. Renouncing a leading role in the party, he helped contribute to the publication of \"Ragnarok\" as an alternative forum for Norse racialists and pursued a strategy of consolidating disparate opponents against Quisling within the NS. Now the downfall of \"Masonic\" Quisling and \"Jewish parliamentarianism\" has propelled Barth-Heyerdahl and the \"Ragnarok\" Circle to power. The time has come to head the voice of the ancestors and restore the Norse race to greatness."

They elide the problems inherent in urban life, the lies of egalitarian thinking and the delusion of equality between all men. He more than any other Norwegian author clearly articulates \"the whisper of blood, and the pleading of bone marrow\" that define the human condition. \n\nIt is thus only natural that we should give credit to this literary genius and proclaim him as our national author.

A staunch constitutionalist, His Majesty believes that his duty is to protect the people and their freedoms from tyranny, a duty he undertakes out of a spirit of fatherly love. To this effect, he has opposed our agenda as an undemocratic imposition upon an unwilling Norwegian people. This view is mistaken. \n\nWhile the nature of our governmental system may have changed, the aim of achieving what is best for the people has not. Like the King, we wish only to devote our lives to the good of Norway. In 1905, His Majesty declared that he would unite and not divide, leading a nation not a party.

Moreover, the Social Democrats appeared to have been agnostic to the concept of a Socialist dictatorship and now are liable to be infiltrated by the remnants of that movement. \n\nThe only solution to this entryist danger is to consolidate all forces of both \"Mountain and Fjord\" and Bourgeois Norway into one coalition, capable of dominating legislative life.

NOR_NAT_national_solidarism_desc:0 "In his travels through Russia in the 20s, Vidkun Quisling came into contact with the Solidarist ideas embraced by the younger generation of the White Movement. Seeing valuable insights in regards to class relations and agreeing on the need for socialisation of persons according to profession, Quisling would incorporate some of these ideas into the program of the NS. \n\nThose bright young Russians have now consolidated under the banner of the \"National Union of the New Generation\" promoting a democratic vision for class solidarity and civic nationalism.

We must rectify this misplaced prejudice, for if the tales of our Viking forefathers have taught us anything, is that a woman is as strong and fearsome in combat as any man.

Instead, this poison shall be replaced by a fervent ideological purity that will allow us to wash away not only the old ideals, but any thought of engaging in corruption at all.

For it is this land which Leif Erikson discovered almost millennium and gave its rightful name of Vinland. While Erikson erred in his Christian ways —a fact Odin must have surely punished him for when he drove him astray at sea— his intrepid spirit reflect the true values of the Aryan religion. The land may be bereft of the Skraelings that gave him such difficulties in the first, but it rests under the equally unworthy rule of the corrupted Anglo-Saxons. The time has come for us restore it to our patrimony and show them the truth of the All-Father into the bargain."

Who was he but a Northman and follower of the All-Father? Only his strength and will was able to unite the fractious Slavs into a people worth speaking of. The time has come for us to reclaim his legacy and once more impose order on Rus and burn the icons to the White Christ that they are so fond of making."


#Greater Norway Claims#

NOR_NAT_claims_to_greater_norway_desc:0 "Norway once dominated the North Atlantic, stretching from Greenland to the Kola Peninsula. Though it has been centuries since this Golden Age, we are unlikely to find a better climate in which to restate and pursue our claims that the current age. We must take advantage of this, and restore our nation to its previous glory."
NOR_NAT_develop_atlantic_isles:0 "Develop the Atlantic Islands"
NOR_NAT_develop_atlantic_isles_desc:0 "While Greenland and the North Sea Islands are not capable of sustaining large-scale industry or populations, their strategic position makes them excellent sites for military installations and buildup. Combining this with efforts to improve local infrastructure would both benefit our armed forces, and further the integration of these territories into Norway."
NOR_NAT_develop_mainland:0 "Develop the Mainland Conquests"
NOR_NAT_develop_mainland_desc:0 "The newly acquired territories on the Scandinavian Peninsula are well suited for both manufacturing and infrastructural development. By capitalizing on this potential, we will be able to expand our industrial base in these regions and make the recent conquests feel like a core part of our nation."
NOR_NAT_develop_iceland:0 "Develop Iceland"
NOR_NAT_develop_iceland_desc:0 "The foremost of our conquest has been our ancient colony of Iceland. To cement the reunion with the Metropole and further integration, we will begin a wide-reaching program to improve infrastructure, develop light industry and establish bases for our Air Force. These will help bring the Icelanders into contact with their new government, and bring up the process to a point where we can begin to analyze further political integration."

NOR_NAT_status_of_iceland_desc:0 "An independent minded people, the Icelanders have enjoyed the status of living in an sovereign state since the Weltkrieg, and have had independent institutions for centuries before that. Our conquest has not yet directly intruded on these institutions, with an emphasis on keeping those willing to work with us in places of power. However, if our administration is to be long lasting we must now determine the political status of Iceland’s institutions on a more permanent basis."

### Events ###
norway.1.t:0 "The State of Norway"
norway.1.d:0 "Norway is standing at a crossroad in history. While the nation is relatively prosperous, civil society is plagued by political infighting and stagnation. The left is divided as a result of schisms within in the once dominant Labour Party. In 1921 the moderate faction broke away and formed the Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway, while the radical syndicalist wing broke away to form the Norwegian Syndicalist Federation in 1923. In addition, the Communist Party of Norway is struggling and there are rumours about forming a new vanguard party of the far left, based upon the principles of National-Syndicalism. On the opposite end of the political spectrum, several nationalist organisations are jockeying for power and influence. While they are somewhat united in their opposition to socialism, their means and goals differ. While the political infighting has not resulted in violence, the ruling Liberal Party is mostly powerless to handle pressing issues due to its minority government. As dark clouds are gathering once more over Europe, the people are anxiously awaiting the election in October 1936."
norway.1.a:0 "Enig og tro til Dovre faller."

norway.2.t:0 "Trade Mission to Japan"
norway.2.d:0 "The lack of international trade has crippled the Norwegian economy since 1925. One of the underlying issues is the lack of work for our large merchant navy. A bright individual in the foreign department has recently proposed reaching out to the Empire of Japan, as it could prove a market for our dried-fish and whaling trade. We could also lease some merchant ships to the Japanese at favourable rates. If successful, an agreement would provide much needed contracts for our merchant navy."
norway.2.a:0 "Send a trade delegation."
norway.2.b:0 "The idea is ridiculous."

norway.3.t:0 "Mission from Norway"
norway.3.d:0 "We recently received a trade delegation from the Kingdom of Norway. The country seeks new trading partners as it is not a part of the German 'Reichspakt' that dominates trade on the European mainland. They seek to trade, among other things, dried-fish and have offered us very favourable rates on Norwegian merchant shipping. Most of our trade experts are in favour of accepting, while a few oppose the use of foreign shipping in moving Japanese goods."
norway.3.a:0 "We won't refuse a good deal."
norway.3.b:0 "Politely decline."

norway.4.t:0 "Norvego-Japanese Trade Agreement of 1936"
norway.4.d:0 "Our proposal for a trade agreement has been accepted by the Japanese government and was signed in Tokyo this morning. It will provide much needed relief for parts of our economy."
norway.4.a:0 "Great!"

norway.5.t:0 "The Japanese Decline"
norway.5.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Japanese government has declined our trade agreement. It seems we will have to find other markets for our industry."
norway.5.a:0 "Apparently, the idea was ridiculous after all..."

norway.6.t:0 "End of the NKP"
norway.6.d:0 "Today the NKP, the Communist Party of Norway, disbanded itself. Having failed to capitalise on the current economic crisis, the party decided to disband itself and have its members join the newly created the National Syndicalist Party of Norway. Based upon the new teaching of politicians such as Benito Mussolini and Oswald Mosley, popularly known as 'Totalism', the party hopes to aspire to greater things than communism ever proved capable of."
norway.6.a:0 "Yet another party of the left?"

norway.7.t:0 "Protests Against Farm Foreclosures"
norway.7.d:0 "The current economic crisis has caused a lot of farmers to default on their loans and mortgages. As a result, their livestock and property is normally auctioned away to the highest bidder by local authorities. The practise is deeply unpopular among Norwegian farmers, but its proponents claim that debts must be repaid and that the auctions are a necessary evil in a free market economy. Yesterday, the Farmers' Party proposed a bill that would ban the auctions. What is the governments position on the issue?"
norway.7.a:0 "Allow the auctions to continue."
norway.7.b:0 "Pass the bill and ban the auctions."

norway.8.t:0 "The Birth of Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp"
norway.8.d:0 "Today, a loose grouping of landowners, farmers and right-wing politicians announced the establishment of Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp. Partly political and partly economic, the goal of the organisation is to oppose the farm auctions and aid farmers in need. Questions have already been raised regarding its independence, as its founders are all members of the party Nasjonal Samling. While some newspapers have praised its creation, others are denouncing the organisation as nothing more than a ploy to increase support for Nasjonal Samling in rural areas."
norway.8.a:0 "Unfortunate."

norway.9.t:0 "Quisling's Speech"
norway.9.d:0 "Vidkun Quisling, a former minister of defence and the leader of the paternal autocratic party Nasjonal Samling, recently held a public rally. In his speech, Quisling denounced the government for both its handling of the economic crisis and the lack of measures taken against the Norwegian syndicalists. He encouraged his supporters to join Samfundsvernet, a conservative paramilitary organisation, claiming that Samfundsvernet and Nasjonal Samling was Norway's last line of defence against syndicalism."
norway.9.a:0 "Last line against syndicalism? Really...?"

norway.10.t:0 "Samfundsvernet and the State"
norway.10.d:0 "Since Samfundsvernet was founded in 1923, the paramilitary organisation has been a bulwark against syndicalism. Although controlled and supported by conservative and nationalist circles, it was even granted status as reserve-police by the Police Act of 1928. However, Quisling's recent speech has filled its ranks with members of the Nasjonal Samling and further radicalised the organisation. Several voices have raised concern regarding this development and wants us to curtail the organisation."
norway.10.a:0 "Revoke their status and suppress the organisation."
norway.10.b:0 "They are a defence against Syndicalism."

norway.11.t:0 "Failure at Suppression"
norway.11.d:0 "Our attempts at suppressing Samfundsvernet have failed. The right-wing parties would not accept any compromise regarding the organisation, while the left-wing parties demanded an outright ban. As a result, we couldn't build a parliamentary majority on the issue."
norway.11.a:0 "They will remain a danger..."

norway.12.t:0 "The Formation of Red Guards"
norway.12.d:0 "Our intelligence service is reporting that the syndicalist parties and trade unions are covertly organising paramilitary red guards. While this is most likely a response to the radicalisation of Samfundsvernet, it is an unsettling development."
norway.12.a:0 "What can we do..."

norway.13.t:0 "Influence from the UoB"
norway.13.d:0 "The Union of Britain has begun influencing our political system. It seems they are supporting syndicalist groupings with funds and attempting to undermine the legitimacy of our democracy in the left-wing press."
norway.13.a:0 "Damned syndicalists!"

norway.14.t:0 "Stortingsvalget 1936"
norway.14.d:0 "Today, the Norwegian people elects a new parliament. The election is tightly fought and will decide the course of Norway in the foreseeable future. There are four possible outcomes. First of all, the radical-socialist Labour Party is campaigning on a platform of socialist reform. Were this to happen, the Society Guard has declared that such a victory would force their hand. The second possibility is a government of the social-democratic Labour Party in coalition with the Liberal Party. Alternatively, the market liberal Conservatives could gain power together with the Farmers' party. Finally, the Farmers' Party could theoretically coalition with the Fedrelandslaget, assuming that both parties overperform quite significantly. Who will win?"
norway.14.a:0 "The Radical-Socialists wins a Plurality."
norway.14.b:0 "The Social-Democrats and Liberals gain a Majority."
norway.14.c:0 "The Conservatives and Farmers' Party form a Coalition."
norway.14.e:0 "The Farmers' Party and Fedrelandslaget form a minority government, in a shocking twist."

norway.15.t:0 "Choosing the Prime Minister"
norway.15.d:0 "After gaining a surprising plurality in the election, the Labour party will now attempt to form a minority government. There are two candidates for the post of Prime Minister. Olav Scheflo, the party leader, is the natural choice for the post. However, some are calling for the more moderate Sverre Støstad to lead the government. Who is the new Prime Minister?"
norway.15.a:0 "Olav Scheflo, the party chief."
norway.15.b:0 "Sverre Støstad, the moderate socialist."

norway.16.t:0 "The Conservatives Protest"
norway.16.d:0 "The conservative and far-right parties have issued a formal protest against the formation of a radical Labour government. The claim said government is a threat to the stability of the nation and demand that the king appoints someone else. However, the king is not inclined to break with parliamentary procedure and has stated that 'I am also king for the syndicalists'."
norway.16.a:0 "It is the will of the people!"

norway.17.t:0 "Choosing the Prime Minister"
norway.17.d:0 "After gaining a majority in the election, the Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway will form a government together with the Liberal Party. There are two candidates for the post of Prime Minister. The favourite, Magnus Nilssen, has lead the party since splitting from the radicals in 1921. The other option is the charismatic parliamentarian, Johan Nygaardsvold, who is wanted by younger members of the party. Who is the new Prime Minister?"
norway.17.a:0 "Magnus Nilssen, the party leader."
norway.17.b:0 "Johan Nygaardsvold, darling of the young guard."

norway.18.t:0 "Choosing the Prime Minister"
norway.18.d:0 "After forming a coalition with the Farmers' Party, the Conservative Party will now form a government. There are two candidates for the post of Prime Minister. Carl Joachim Hambro, the able and experienced party veteran, and Johan Henrik Andresen, the famous industrialist. Who is the new Prime Minister?"
norway.18.a:0 "Carl Joachim Hambro, president of the Storting."
norway.18.b:0 "Johan Henrik Andresen, the businessman."

norway.20.t:0 "The Opening of the 85th Storting"
norway.20.d:0 "Today, the king opened the 85th Storting and announced the political programme of the new government. The transfer of power has been peaceful and the new government will begin its work as soon as possible."
norway.20.a:0 "Our democracy is strong."

norway.21.t:0 "The Opening of the 85th Storting"
norway.21.d:0 "Today, the king opened the 85th Storting and announced the political programme of the new government. Our democracy is lucky to have survived and Prime Minister Nansen will have his work cut out for him if he is to heal the wounds of the political crisis."
norway.21.a:0 "Our democracy will be strong again."

norway.22.t:0 "Governor Rygg Critise the Government"
norway.22.d:0 "Nicolai Rygg, former minister of finance and the current governor of the Norwegian Central Bank, has begun to harshly criticise the government in public. Acording to Rygg, the country is bound for economic devastation and he strongly encourage the opposition to defeat the government. Governor Rygg is quite the influental man and his opposition is bound to be shared by the established political parties."
norway.22.a:0 "Why won't he shut up?"

norway.23.t:0 "The Scope of Socialist Reform"
norway.23.d:0 "With our party in government, we need to decide upon the scope of our reform agenda. As we only have a parliamentary plurality, we would need support from other parties to pass the laws. A majority of our party wants to enact some limited labour legislation, including work hours and safety regulations, that would easily gain support from the social democrats and liberals. A minority believes we should exploit our recent electoral victory and attempt to push for nationalisation of critical industries. While such a plan won't easily pass parliament, it could perhaps garner some support from certain right-wing elements."
norway.23.a:0 "Minor Reform. Enact some labour legislation."
norway.23.b:0 "Major Reform. Nationalise critical industries."

norway.24.t:0 "Quisling and Samfundsvernet Mobilise"
norway.24.d:0 "This morning, Vidkun Quisling occupied at studio at the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and started broadcasting on the radio. He announced that parliament would pass a motion of no confidence against the government the following day. To keep the peace and secure an orderly transition of power, Samfundsvernet would mobilise and protect important public institutions. In the end, Quisling justified these actions by blaiming the government for its dangerous, revolutionary plans.\n\nAs the guardsmen took to the street, the police refused to take action. Clashes soon developed between guardsmen and worker's militias as the situation rapidly escalated."
norway.24.a:0 "We have a mandate for change!"

norway.25.t:0 "The Unions Mobilise"
norway.25.d:0 "As the crisis continue to escalate, the trade unions have mobilised and declared a general strike. Martin Tranmæl, one of the most important syndicalist figures in Norway, declared support for the government and denounced the bourgeois opposition. Acording to Tranmæl, the Labour Party will not be able to stand on its own, while the bourgeois establishment is plotting to crush the organisations of the common man. The worker must now take matters into his own hands, claims Tranmæl.\n\nAs battle rages in the streets of Oslo, it seems that the police and army have orders to remain in their barracks."
norway.25.a:0 "The country is holding its breath!"

norway.26.t:0 "The Hour of Decision!"
norway.26.d:0 "As the battle of Oslo rages for the third day, power hangs in the balance. Both sides have a certain claim to legitimacy and whoever captures the capital will likely control the country. The worker's guards claim to be defending the legitimate government, while Samfundsvernet wish to enable the parliamentary downfall of said government. At the same time, in light of the crisis, the King has fled to Canada. As the battle reaches its climax..."
norway.26.a:0 "The Worker's Militias take the Capital and impeach the bourgeoise elements."
norway.26.b:0 "Samfundsvernet capture Parliament and Quisling forms a Government."

norway.27.t:0 "A Syndicalist Norway"
norway.27.d:0 "With the help of the Trade Unionists, the labour government has managed to survive the bourgeoise attacks on the rightful government. Now they have the power and capacity to reform Norway in a manner that has not been seen before. At the end of this, Norway will have achieved socialism!"
norway.27.a:0 "All Power to the Workers."

norway.28.t:0 "Choosing a new General-Secretary"
norway.28.d:0 "Who will fill the post of general secretary in our new government?"
norway.28.a:0 "Konrad Nordahl, the Trade Unionist Leader."
norway.28.b:0 "Haakon Lie, the Party Secretary."

nor_new.1.t:0 "In Search of Paradise?"
nor_new.1.d:0 "Norway has recently been captivated by reports from the remote South Pacific Island of Fatu Hiva. The island has recently become the home of one Thor Heyerdahl and his new wife Liv. The two have sailed to the Pacific as part of a research expedition to investigate the fauna of the Marquesas. Supported by academics in both Norway and Germany, Heyerdahl has also sent reports on the ancient civilisation of the islands. \n These have gradually given rise to speculations on the existence of a race of \"Aryan\" Tiki people could have settled Polynesia from South America, an idea he claims he would like to test in the future. While traditional scholarship has dismissed this as nonsense, Nordicist groupings in the country have latched onto the notion as proof of their racial theories. Whatever the case, Heyerdahl's reports from the island will continue to excite the minds of the Norwegian people."
nor_new.1.a:0 "He has the makings of a great explorer!"

nor_new.2.t:0 "Establishment Politics Under Attack"
nor_new.2.d:0 "As the prospect of a Socialist victory in the coming elections becomes ever more likely, the political establishment has found itself subjected to increasing criticism on all sides. There is a growing feeling that democratic process has failed and that radical solutions are necessary to solve Norway's problems. More and more ordinary citizens are moving towards the extreme left or extreme right and political violence has become alarmingly commonplace. If we fail to convince the population that we are able to solve their problems, they may renounce parliamentarianism entirely."
nor_new.2.a:0 "Political polarisation reaches a boiling point."

nor_new.3.t:0 "The \"Aerosol\" Spray Can"
nor_new.3.d:0 "First developed in 1926 by inventor Erik Rotheim, the \"Aerosol\" Spray Can consists of a mixture of a chemical propellant and the intended spray product. The mixture is put into a pressurised steel bottle with an adjustable valve and a fine nozzle. The propellant has to be in a gaseous form at normal temperature and pressure, but becomes a liquid at 4 or 5 atmospheres worth of pressure. When the valve opens, the mixture will be forced out through the nozzle opening. The propellant will then evaporate and the product will be atomised into a fine shower. \n\nIn 1927, Rotheim demonstrated his the invention to paint manufacturer Alf Bjercke, and the following year, Bjercke entered into an agreement with Rotheim to utilise his patents for paints and varnishes and liquid bone wax. Unfortunately, the product required constant improvement and was expensive to produce, with spray cans made by hand and seam welded. In addition, the initial use of dimethyl as a propellant posed issues due to the high cost of the gas and its inflammable nature. \n\nThough Rotheim set up a separate foundation to advertise the \"Rotheim Spraying System\" and exploit the patent internationally, even receiving an offer from Standard Oil for the patent, he was forced to wind up commercial activities in 1935. With Rotheim having sold his patent to his collaborator, the instrument maker Frode Mortensen, the latter man has now set up a company of his own, with the goal of finally succeeding in marketing the product."
nor_new.3.a:0 "An ingenious invention. Let us hope he succeeds."

NOR_aerosol_spray_cans:0 "Aerosol Spray Cans"

nor_new.4.t:0 "Bror With Offers His Services"
nor_new.4.d:0 "Following the formation of the Organisation XU, we have made a succesful effort to recruit the inventor Bror With as a technical specialist. While most Norwegians know With as the inventor of the \"Rottefella\" (Rat-trap) ski-binding and a celebrated athlete, he is also an ingenious inventor and mechanical engineer. It is the latter traits that make him an excellent candidate for general quartermaster of the XU. \n\nTo that end, we have inducted him under the codename \"Granat-Larsen\" and put him to work creating equipment for agents in the field. He has already managed to achieve success in copying the British \"Sten\" design and is now proposing the \"Dromedille\", a revolutionary dinghy design that will allow agents in the field to more effectively displace on water"
nor_new.4.a:0 "A genius and a patriot."

nor_new.5.t:0 "Governor Rygg Asks for Assurances"
nor_new.5.d:0 "After our victory in the elections, Bank Governor Rygg has approached our party to offer his advice. A staunch believer in a strong currency and the gold standard, he would like us to pursue what he views as a sound economic policy. Naturally, this cautious approach is at odds with our more lofty goals, which would require large-scale spending. Additionally, Rygg is no friend of our party, having pushed the opposition to work against us in the past. While following his advice would mean renouncing some of our bolder initiatives, it would calm business sentiments and show we are capable of governing for all Norwegians.\n\nWith all this in mind, what shall we say to him?" 
nor_new.5.a:0 "We promise to govern responsibly."
nor_new.5.b:0 "We won't sell out the working class!"

nor_new.6.t:0 "Returning to the Gold Standard?"
nor_new.6.d:0 "Fresh off our success in restoring confidence in free market principles here in Norway, Bank Governor Rygg has come to us with a proposal. He feels that the economic situation has stabilized enough where we can return the Krone to the gold standard, dramatically increasing the value of our currency abroad. Such a move would lessen our trade deficit and secure easier access to goods we do not produce here in Norway. \n\nAt the same time, it would also be liable to galvanize Labour by obliging us to maintain a more restricted monetary supply antithetical to the Social Democratic economic policy.  They already decry the Bank Governor as a modern Midas, forever obsessed with gold and would invariably tar us with the same brush if we implement his desired policy. It may therefore be wiser for us to renounce the idea in favour of reaching a compromise policy with Labour. \n\nWill we listen to Rygg and pursue this industrially desirable policy, or will we swear off the standard to reach an accommodation with the Social Democrats?" 
nor_new.6.a:0 "We cannot remain bound to the golden calf."
nor_new.6.b:0 "We will cautiously move back to gold."

nor_new.7.t:0 "Publication of the [GetYear] Agricultural Census" 
nor_new.7.d:0 "Statistics Norway has recently published its most recent Agricultural Census and the government must react accordingly. Despite a dismal decade in agriculture, the land under cultivation has increased since the last census. This may be attributable to a recent re-evaluation of natural meadows and other grazing land perhaps contributing to this result. Farming remains concentrated on smallholdings, many of which continue to lack horses for labour intensive activities. Haymaking and dairy production remain key priorities for farmers, with both taking significant efforts. \n\nAll this paints a picture of an agricultural sector with great potential, but a need for economies of scale to assist production. Two proposals have been offered for dealing with these problems. The first would be to expand government intervention via subsidies to farmers and create an agency to further plan agriculture, which is sure to meet resistance. The second would be to focus on developing agricultural cooperatives and give farmers the tools they need to self-organise and increase production via shared stakeholding. Which of the two options do we prefer?"
nor_new.7.a:0 "Create the Budget Committee for Agriculture and supplement the Ministry with a Directorate on Agricultural Administration."
nor_new.7.b:0 "Focus on developing cooperatives through targeted measures and industry-specific legislation."

nor_new.8.t:0 "Uniting the Working Class"
nor_new.8.d:0 "Now that we have formed a government and begun the business of administering the country, we are already beginning to see how conditions on the ground are starting to change. Having seen that a party for the working man can win free and fair elections without compromising their programme, workers are already beginning to move away from the radicalism of the far-left and back towards Labour. While the professional activists and agitators are unlikely to join them, we are already beginning to win back total control of the shop and factory floor. \n\nWe should profit from these developments and make sure to emphasize the working classes that we —and not bomb chucking radicals— are their natural allies for a better, freer life. With any luck, by year’s end the far-left & their Syndicalist masters will no longer pose any real danger to democracy in our country." 
nor_new.8.a:0 "All men work and all men must vote."

nor_new.9.t:0 "Hambro and His Highness"
nor_new.9.d:0 "While [NOR.GetLeader] would never stoop to undermining the democratic system by expressing fondness for one party or another, he does of course have his own views. In that respect, he aligns most closely with the bourgeois values espoused by Hoyre. The party's victory in the recent elections has thus been a great comfort to the King. Accordingly, he has recently invited president of the Storting and party heavyweight, C. J. Hambro to dine with him and looks set to involve himself in our project to revitalize parliamentary democracy." 
nor_new.9.a:0 "A vote of confidence from the highest level."

nor_new.10.t:0 "Touring the Countryside"
nor_new.10.d:0 "In the period immediately after our victory in the elections, we have made sure to undertake a number of rallies up and down the countryside. While we are never going to be a party for the urban working class, we can still strengthen our hold on rural areas and win back voters lost to the other parties. This is especially important now that we have formed a coalition with Fedrelandsforbundet, which will invariably require a balancing act between their more nationalistic tendencies and potential allies within Hoyre. Our party's position has always been one tenuously dependent on rural mobilisation and a victory now is no guarantee of future success. \n\nLet us therefore make the most of this effort and consolidate for the next election."
nor_new.10.a:0 "We speak for the \"Mountain and Fjord\" Norway."

nor_new.11.t:0 "Exploiting the Arctic Seas"
nor_new.11.d:0 "The Arctic region is one of the toughest seas to navigate in the world, and the extreme conditions have claimed many a soul there. But to Norwegian sailors, these waters are a second home, and we must exploit this experience to the maximum. Areas such as Svalbard hold many riches in both minerals and sea bounty, and there are still regions with plenty of unclaimed land or dubious claims that we could work to overturn through rigorous exploration and pressing our claims more aggressively. The government must further fund the various fishing and whaling barques so that we can better harness the wealth we have within arms reach. However, many fishermen sailing in the Norwegian sea claim that the perfidious Anglo fishermen from the Union of Britain are harassing their vessels and pushing deep into the Norwegian waters. Similarly, increased Canadian and German activity in those seas is making many sailors nervous, and thus there has been an increased demand towards the navy to actually protect our national waters and fishing vessels from raiders and interlopers. \n\nThese incidents our fishermen have had with foreign vessels could be used as a precedent to push for more aggressive use of our navy, not only to protect our fishing waters but to push the limits of our national sea borders further. The boost Norwegian economy could receive from gaining larger access to all the riches of the Arctic is by no means small. The great amounts of cod and the occasional whale catches around the Faroe Islands, the only location with relatively active whaling industry, help feed Norwegians, while the minerals of Svalbard and other islands are important to our industry. Companies such as Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani A/S and Bjørnøen AS produce coal primarily, but with enough state subsidies and support, these ventures could be expanded to acquire different types of resources such as copper, phosphates and bauxite, all important and vital resources not only for Norway but to the European markets. With the limited resources our mainland possesses, the islands and archipelagos of the Arctic sea may very well be the only logical step towards expanding our economy further. After all, who knows what riches lie there, beyond the tundra and open sea, buried under the ice and snow for millennia." 
nor_new.11.a:0 "We must not neglect the natural wealth of the sea."

nor_new.12.t:0 "Doctor Scharffenberg & the Eugenics Act"
nor_new.12.d:0 "Now that our new government has had time to settle in, we have been approached by the long-time supporter of the Social Democratic movement and Chief Physician of the Oslo Hospital, Johan Scharffenberg. Already well known for advancing the cause of prohibition and for his opposition to capital punishment, he has now approached us to champion his newest initiative in improving the lives of the common man: The promotion of \"Racial Hygiene\". \n\nInspired by developments in the United States, Sweden & Germany, Doctor Scharffenberg would like us to pass a law facilitating the sterilisation of subnormal, disabled and congenitally ill persons. He believes that this will improve the condition of the general population by preventing undesirable matches in the underclasses and the production of offspring who would otherwise suffer unduly. While these members are no doubt popular with academia and the medical community, some argue that it would compromise the essence of our party’s mission to subject the least fortunate to such policies.  \n\nEither way, the time has come for us we to decide. Will we take up Doctor Scharffenberg’s cause with him or reject it as a bridge too far?" 
nor_new.12.a:0 "A healthy race means a healthy worker."

However, there is also an ethnic dimension to this desire. \n The United States is home to a number of people of Norwegian ancestry, many of them concentrated in the territory of the American Union State.

For his part, the King has serious doubts as to whether his new Prime Minister can be relied on to protect Norway's constitutional democracy.\n However, both Høyre and the NSA have been greatly discredited by their inability to stop the Socialists from forming a government in the last elections or mobilize a democratic opposition to their agenda thereafter. As a result, some voices have begun to call for a cabinet under the Bondepartiet, whose conservative platform may be enough to appease the nationalists. Given the tense relations between Jens Hundseid and Quisling, this will invariably require the cabinet to be headed by an alternative figure, preferably without existing political ties. The most likely candidate for this would be the celebrated humanitarian Odd Nansen, the son of Quisling's old friend and mentor, Fridtjof Nansen.\n The Nansen name alone is unlikely to convince Quisling to cede power, which is why it has been proposed to elevate him to a lifetime appointment as a \"Statsråd for life\" to the Council of State, \"in recognition for services to his country\". In a nation where aristocratic privileges have been gradually eradicated, this highly irregular gesture would mean a lifetime position as a minister without portfolio and the the de-facto equivalent of a noble title, an incredible honour. \n What does the king decide?"

On the local level, we have already begun delegating Fører power unto the mayors, while the old municipal system is allowed to wither away. Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior has been given a Corporations Office, tasked with assimilating all voluntary associations under the state. This process of coordination raises an important question. Should we first focus on building up our control of the state apparatus? Or should we wage a more aggressive campaign to coordinate all facets of public life under the party? \n The former option would be conducive to good governance, but the latter holds the promise of a populace surrounded by the party's values from cradle to grave.

As we have now realized, that toxic system breeds naught but cliques of inefficient career politicians and other leeches upon our great nation. However, our government can rule with an iron fist and expect its citizens to simply accept this state of affairs, especially so shortly after the transition away from parliamentary democracy. It is thus clear that a new system of representation must be established. The Fører, during his time in Russia at the height of the civil war, experienced first-hand the attempted implementation of the council system, allowing for the representation of the Soviet people in a truly participatory form. \n\nEver since, he has sought to create an organization similar to those observed in Russia —of course wiped clean of the Bolshevik taint—  and the newly formed Riksting may prove to be the solution to this desire for a non-parliamentary representation. \n\nThe Riksting is heavily inspired by the experiments of Italian corporatists, most notably the failed Fiume parliament, as modified to fit the Norwegian conditions and as further theorized by the Fører and his supporter Herman Harris Aall. The Riksting operates through the voluntary participation of citizens willing to fix the ails plaguing this nation. As a result, the very fabric of this new national institution would be built from the ground up by these patriotic volunteers. \n\nThe various professions would also receive representation in this new assembly, in the form of those members of their craft deemed worthy enough of the honour of a seat. The involvement of these guilds will better allow us to avoid the pitfalls of worker unrest by granting them the means to participate more profoundly in the governance process.\n\nThis new form of assembly would also do away with the current unicameral parliament, replacing it with a bicameral system. It is hoped that with an upper house composed of corporatist actors, the legislative makeup will better suit the new governmental system and facilitate cooperation between the lower house and government."

norway.247.d:0 "Cultivating lifelong personal interests in science, esotericism, eastern religions, dated foreign philosophies, and metaphysics, Vidkun Quisling has slowly formed his own syncretic thoughtform that seeks to create a perfect union between philosophy and science - a union he calls Universism. Universism, or Universalism as it is also known, is - in the words of Quisling - a unified explanation of everything, and is itself a term borrowed from a textbook which the renowned sinologist Jan Jakob Maria de Groot had written on Chinese philosophy. Rejecting the basic teachings of orthodox Christianity and establishing a new theory of life in its place, Quisling draws inspiration from De Groot’s idea that Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism are all part of a world religion that De Groot and Quisling call Universism, with Quisling adding his own scientific interests to the mix, describing how his syncretic philosophy ‘flowed from the universal theory of relativity, of which the specific and general theories of relativity are special instances’, holding modern titans of science like Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi in high regards while folding their breakthroughs into his growing thoughtform. \n\nAdditionally pulling from ancient texts like the I Ching of Western Zhou-era China and from philosophies like the Neoplatonism of Hellenistic 3rd century Rome, for he always had a penchant for the classical philosophs over any modern interpretations or schools of thought, Quisling has created a strange mixture of ideas he believes will save Norway and Nordic society at large, slowly tinkering on these ideas in the background over his years in politics, all culminated within a soon-to-be published work called ‘The World's Organic Classification and Organisations’. His self-described magnum opus, this tome is divided into four parts: an introduction, a description of mankind's apparent progression from individual to increasing complex consciousnesses, a section on his tenets of morality and law, and a final section on science, art, politics, history, race and religion, in totality outlining his concept of Universism and how it could carry our nation into a new and enlightened golden age should it be accepted wholeheartedly by the masses. However, with most of the nation being contended Christians or secularists, this Universism is a hard sell to say the least. So, shall we reveal to masses these undeniable and fundamental truths of the universe, or shall we let them stay blissfully ignorant, blinded by the light of Christ, at least until we have cultivated a more accepting national sentiment towards such ideas."

Serving as our shining shield, the institution has come to justify our actions to conservative and traditionalist circles under the pretence that we have been saving the nation from sin, debauchery, and damnation. Furthermore, the Church’s youth programmes and weekly sermons, now fully attuned to the needs and decrees of the State, preach our truths to the endless waves of desperate believers. As a result, their teaching ensures that each successive generation will find itself more deeply attuned to our righteous truths and rhetoric than the last. \n\nDivinely guided and morally supreme —if only to garner broader support— our administration shall continue to utilize the Lutheran Church as the ‘invisible’ guiding hand in matters of education and civil proctoring. We shall continue to disavow the baseless immorality and propagate the enforcement of morality, piety, obedience, and civic duty among youths across the country for as long necessary. So long as each generation mutters their prayers while living within the \"pious\"parameters we have set, our needs will be met and no one will have anything to worry about."

Aimed at showcasing and promoting the more traditional art styles and classical masterworks of Norway’s proud artistic history, the event has also taken a defiant stance against more modern, degenerate waves of ‘art.’ Paintings like \"Skrik\" —also called the \"Der Schrei der Natur\" or simply \"The Scream\"— and other pieces by proto-expressionist painter Edvard Munch represent the degenerate decay and hedonistic decadence of modern Norwegian society. For too long, Liberalism has allowed such \"art\"  to grow like a fungal rot from the corpse of our pre-modern cultural perfection. \n\nIn lieu of Munch and other modernist hacks, such as the impressionist Frits Thaulow or the French-educated Krohg couple, we shall now support and showcase the old masters and contemporary artists whose artistic vision embodies a true care for Norway’s culture and history. Hans Fredrik Gude, Peder Balke, Johan Christian Dahl and the rising star of Quislingist-Universist art: Gustav Vigeland, the ‘modern Michelangelo of Norway’. \n\nVigeland has begun to be likened to another rising star —with a similar moniker— of traditionalist Prussian art, one Arno Breker. The former man has begun to correspond with the latter regarding their joint interest in displaying Germano-Nordic perfection. In this respect, the two are united in their shared preferred medium of marble and stone sculpture, which they see as ideal for exhibition of the heroic form. \n\nAs we burn the works of Bohemian degenerates like Much, we shall ensure that all of Norway is immersed in our true and best culture. Let us instead extoll the works of Vigeland and others sympathetic to our cause and the aesthetics of Profound Norway. Death to the hedonistic propaganda of foreign-influenced filth!

Though this is far from the first time such a dilemma has wracked the Prime Minister, he must now hone in on a specific avenue forward for the movement, lest we aimlessly drift between disparate ideologies without clear purpose. \n\nThe party could remain true to traditionalist, conservative Norwegian values and Nordicist supremacism, or it could focus on the Fører’s fascination with the Maurassian Integralism whose doctrines took the International Right by storm in these past few decades. Alternatively, we could focus on Quisling and the Norwegian public’s Anglophile tendencies. The latter option would mean emphasizing our appreciation for the traditionalism and aristocratic lineage of pre-revolution (particularly Stuart) England and their High Tory heirs within Canada’s rightist sphere.\n\n Regardless of what choice Quisling makes, we shall remain dedicated to our broad programme. All this latest preoccupation will mean is another unique Quislingist twist on theory thrown into our general political concoction.

To the shock of many, even the King broke his recent tendency to keep a low profile and arrived late to the ceremonies alongside the Prime Minister Vidkun Quisling. However, the darting glances and sour scowls the two shared with each other throughout the entire day made clear that this was by no means an amicable arrangement. The presence of His Majesty —rather than a stuffy old suit from the ministry of war— was well received by all, especially as our military prepares for the seemingly inevitable threat of war. \n\nRumour has it that the two men got into quite the argument before their public appearance, with the King insisting that he make his presence known in order to thank the new graduates for their hard work and heroic patriotism. This statement was apparently much to the chagrin of Quisling, who wanted to take today’s spotlight for himself.

The event has drawn national attention, appropriate to Nansen's immense contributions to both Norwegian identity and his global humanitarian legacy. Among those present was Nansen’s son, Odd, an architect and humanitarian in his own right. Standing alongside his Majesty, Odd gave the inaugural speech, praising not just the legacy of his father, but the integral role played by Prime Minister Quisling during the relief efforts that Nansen organised in Russia during that country's late civil war. \n\nThe presence of both the King and Odd has gone a great way to emphasize the message of legacy and continuity that we have been attempting to promote, honouring not just the memory of this great Norwegian hero, but presenting the Prime Minister as the natural inheritor of his legacy."

Reiterating the comments he first made almost 50 years ago in the \"The Cultural Life of Modern America \", he condemned the Americans as a people without a real intellectual elite and possessed by a class antipathy that has given rise to racial degeneration. \n\nThe government has been deeply embarrassed by his remarks, which clash sharply with our efforts to project a professional, peaceable, and cooperative image of the movement—especially in the eyes of the middle class here at home. Some support has come from folkish groups who agree with many of the premises found in Hamsun’s critique, but these are exactly the people we have desperately tried to distance ourselves from in the last months. All we can do now is try to prevent Hamsun from making these kind of statements in the future and hope that the scandal will abate on its own."

norway.254.d:0 "With the effects of Black Monday still fresh in the minds of many within the government, new economic theories have been a matter of great interest. An especially high amount has been expressed towards the Social Credit economic theory. Most popular in the territories of the former British Empire, the promise of C. H. Douglas’s doctrine is found in the idea of being able to maintain the economic well-being of nations even in times of depression. This prosperity is meant to be assured through government intervention in the production of goods, assisting with both cost of manufacturing and cost of purchase.\n\n However, Bank Governor Rygg has made it clear he is strongly opposed to the introduction of Social Credit ideas, declaring them to be \"idle populism\". Rygg has been especially quick to call attention to the level of spending that would be required to fulfil such growth and the damage it will due to the Central Bank's efforts to maintain the value of the Krone. A key source of concern is the impact that the devaluation would have on our balance of trade, as we still import critical goods from outside Norway that cannot be easily replaced. Instead, he has urged us to maintain the value of the Krone and ensure that we will be able to buy more goods from abroad with our strong currency. \n\n With all said, shall we listen to Rygg or we will implement Social Credit policies against his opposition?"

These \"Bow Corps\" are formed from children and young people and are part marching band, part parade organisation, with their own colours, flags and structures. Though they began life as nothing more than brawling youth gangs, they have gradually acquired a degree of stricture and formality, while retaining the parade ground discipline. While we have already militarised the Buekorps as a junior force supplementing the militia forces, we have largely abstained from inculcating the corps with an ideological character. \n\nNow that we have completed the militarisation process, some in the party are calling for consolidating party control. By appointing leaders drawn from the existing party youth, we would ensure that the Buekorps adhere to the party line and do not develop heterodox ideas of their own.

norway.256.t:0 "What's in a name?"
norway.256.d:0 "Now that we've united with the Fedrelandslaget, the name of our party has become a highly contentious matter. Bringing the two groups together under one banner has not been a smooth transition. Both sides feel that their ideological identity is being undermined and refuse to see their faction’s influence and prestige shrink. To resolve this infighting before the movement collapses completely, we must decide which name our new party will use going forward. To this end, three main options have been proposed by high-profile individuals within the coalition. \n\nThe first of these options will have us remain as the Nasjonal Samling, keeping the name that Quisling and other veteran supports such as Johan Bernhard Hjort chose when founding the party - this option also allows us to keep our popularity with the more radical supporters that we have already garnered, without turning away from our founding identity. \n\nThe second option is to adopt the name of the much larger Fedrelandslaget. While this may help to boost our own credibility as their political standing and popularity is already much larger than our own to begin with, it comes with the risk of angering the veterans of the Nasjonal Samling, many of whom are already claiming that this move would be a sign that we becoming overly moderate and losing our way. \n\nThe third and final option, is to simply compromise by pandering to both sides. By adopting the \"Fatherland Union\"  name, we hope to forge a new identity for this now-unified movement. This decision may come with the added benefit of co-opting the radicals: the Nasjonal Samling members’ influence can be directed to internal party ideology rather than the external factors of the movement; away from concerns of identity and appearance, and the Fedrelandslaget's popularity and larger popular support can be directed towards a movement that, on the surface, is much the same as before, with a mere name change and new members."

norway.257.d:0 "As the importance of Nasjonal Samling in the field of Norwegian politics grows, the more traditional establishment parties have had some of their more opportunistic members reach out to us for alliances. Surprisingly, Høyre  —the centre-right establishment party— has been among them, though official negotiations for the creation of a proposed Borgerlig Blokk are still in the preliminary phase. \n\n An alliance between Høyre and NS is hardly an easy thing to achieve. Though both parties see themselves as representing the middle-class bourgeois and farmers against the dangers of socialist government, the way these parties go about their policies differs drastically. This is most evident in the bitter feud between Vidkun Quisling and the leader of Høyre, C.J. Hambro, member of the powerful Hambro political dynasty. Hambro pursues his conservative ideals through staunch defence of freedom of speech, cosmopolite diplomacy and criticism of nationalist excesses, and he has frequently denounced the paramilitary, authoritarian and radically nationalist actions of Quisling’s \"thugs\". \n\nHowever, with the recent mellowing of Quisling’s regime and restoration of democracy, Høyre’s distaste for the party has become less outwardly apparent, and if given the chance, they would likely prefer working with government instead of fruitlessly opposing it from the outside. This support would come with major strings attached, as an alliance with Høyre would require [NOR.GetRulingParty] to liberalize parts of its platform and make serious concessions to Hambro’s more moderate ideals. At the least, it would require a curtailment of the use of the party militias and a toning down of nationalist rhetoric. Many more radical members of the former NS feel that this would dilute the core of the party’s program, leading to it becoming yet another stagnant political institution."

norway.258.d:0 "Following another electoral victory by [NOR.GetRulingParty], the time has come to reflect upon the alliances of the last term, especially with Høyre. The concessions the party had to make to maintain the coalition during its first term were notable in their scope. Furthermore, the constant leadership clashes between Quisling and Hambro have not made government sessions particularly enjoyable to anyone, even if the alliance has held. However, many within the [NOR.GetRulingParty], have grown increasingly irritated with having to contend with the stubborn liberals and conservatives of Høyre. \n\nThese less moderate members of the party have rekindled the old arguments from years ago, claiming that without Høyre, our party could reach its full potential and more actively pursue its vision for the nation. They also claim that now that the party has established itself as the leading Norwegian political force, it no longer requires the support of more traditional parties and can stand on its own legs in any parliamentary debates or government sessions. Meanwhile, the moderates argue that it is primarily through the alliance with Høyre that the party has been established as a democratic and credible force, given its former stigma as union of street-brawlers and strongmen. In the end, breaking the coalition will be no small decision, and the party leadership must weigh the consequences with no small amount of seriousness."

Or will we emphasize the guild corporatism of the Solidarist movement and focus on building an economy where the young can best put their patriotic fervour to use? Or perhaps we will retain the syncretic program we have thus far pursued, emphasizing the national particularities of Norway.

Certainly, we are unlikely to find a more competent agitator than him. If we do decide to pursue this course, he would be a natural fit for Minister of Propaganda, a position many in the movement have already demanded we create. \n\nFormer Socialist or no, the possibility of winning the working class over fully is tantalizing.

A third, smaller faction rejects both premises. They argue that our mission is first and foremost a sacred duty. According to this view, there is no point discussing the rebirth of our people without the wisdom to bring it about. This wisdom can only be achieved by communing with the wisdom of the gods, chiefly through the esoteric knowledge imparted by the All-Father in his runes. \n\nWhatever the truth, it is clear that this conflict will only grow if we ignore it.

Then, with the Reformation, the Danish kings forced upon us a Church controlled by Kings puppeteered by White Christ.\n\nThe Norwegian Church has held a monopoly on Norðmanna spiritual life since the Reformation in 1537.

While the Swedes outgun us and overpower us in terms of manpower, we shall make up for what we miss materially in spirit!\n\nWe shall go on to the end, we shall fight in Sweden, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our fylker, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight in the fjords, we shall fight on the border, we shall fight in the forests and in the streets, we shall fight in the mountains; we shall never surrender."

### News Events ###

 norway.324.t:0 "Vidkun Quisling's Counter Revolution"
 norway.324.d:0 "Early this morning, outspoken Norwegian nationalist Vidkun Quisling executed a counter-coup against Norway's recently instated syndicalist government, with the assistance of the armed forces. Quisling was well known as an outspoken critic of the Syndicalists, and led a counter-revolutionary party primarily known for street fights with the socialists.\n\n Militants loyal to the Syndicalist cause have engaged in sporadic combat with the Norwegian Armed Forces, who have sworn allegiance to their new leader. While significant opposition to Quisling's regime is expected, escalation to a civil war is unlikely. As Norway finally gives into its nationalist underbelly, the world can only watch as a hallmark of European liberal democracy slips into autocracy."
 norway.324.a:0 "For better or for worse, Norway is on her own path."
 norway.324.b:0 "The bloody handed butcher!"
 
 norway.325.t:0 "Democratic Victory in the Norwegian Elections"
 norway.325.d:0 "To the shock of many, Democratic parties have managed to form a new government in Norway. While their majority is razor thin, this success represents a shocking blow to the Socialists, who had expected to form the next government, especially after appealing to Third Internationale support. While their supporters cry foul and denounce the \"Party Cartel\", right-wing paramilitaries have been left confused by events, either withdrawing from the streets or being beaten back by the police. \n\n While the new government will have their work cut out for them, they have the endorsement of [NOR.GetLeader], who has already met with his new prime minister and promised them his full support. It has been a close run thing, but it looks as though Norwegian democracy will live another day."
 norway.325.a:0 "Norway's democracy is strong indeed."
 norway.325.b:0 "A capitalist conspiracy, surely."

 norway.326.t:0 "The Ragnarok Circle Seize Power"
 norway.326.d:0 "Shock and horror on the streets of Oslo, as the Hirden paramilitary and dissatisfied elements of the Armed Forces managed to seize control of the palace the putschists have stormed the Slottet. Prime Minister Vidkun Quisling is missing, presumed dead, while the Royal Family have fled into exile for a second time. While the specific justifications for the putsch are as yet unknown, they must surely lie in Quisling's repeated concessions to the political Establishment and parliamentarianism. \n\n While details are sparse, it is now clear the plotters have elevated radical nationalist Stein Barth-Heyerdahl to lead the nation. The latter has promised to drive out the influence of Christianity and \"the White Christ\" in favour of a revival of the Norse religion and political system. Only time will if he will succeed in this endeavour."

### Norwegian Socialism elections ###

nor_syncon.1.t:0 "Landsorganisasjonen - Foreign Policy"
nor_syncon.1.d:0 "As per the new constitution, the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation has been made the primary democratic institution of the new Norwegian people's state. Today they have assembled for the first time to decide on the foreign policy of this new nation for the coming years. Three factions within the confederation have solidified; the moderates, the closest to a continuation of the Labour Party, led by Einar Gerhardsen, the orthodox Syndicalists of the NSF, led by Elias Volan and finally the Maximists, basing themselves on the party of the same name in Britain, led by Albin Eines. Today we vote on foreign policy, and all three factions have their own ideas on this matter. The moderates consider the defence of the nation the most important, and call for a defensive attitude, while the syndicalists consider it our sacred duty to help the internationale liberate the rest of the world. Lastly, the totalists want our foreign policy to focus on Sweden, as according to them, our Swedish neighbour could well doom Norway if handled inadequately."
nor_syncon.1.a:0 "It is our duty to export the revolution with the Brits and French!"
nor_syncon.1.b:0 "The Defence of the Nation is Paramount!"
nor_syncon.1.c:0 "Without Sweden pacified, Norway will never be safe!"

nor_syncon.2.t:0 "Landsorganisasjonen - Military Matters"
nor_syncon.2.d:0 "With the question of foreign policy resolved, the discussion has moved on to military matters. The moderates consider the old manner of military organisation not fit for the revolutionary status quo and want to make officer posts elected amongst the soldiers they lead. The syndicalists fear this will lead to popular but untalented officers to rise to the top at the cost of military efficiency but agree that some kind of democratic control is needed, and therefore argue in favour of reorganising our military into a trade union, where the soldiers elect representatives in a 'board' that instead assigns officers throughout the military. The maximists reject both attempts at democratizing the military, which according to them will only result in inefficiency where it is least needed, and defend the status quo, preferring a traditional army."
nor_syncon.2.a:0 "The syndicalists control the debate!"
nor_syncon.2.b:0 "The moderates win the day!"
nor_syncon.2.c:0 "The maximists secure the status quo!"

nor_syncon.3.t:0 "Landsorganisasjonen - The Economy"
nor_syncon.3.d:0 "Now the confederation has arrived to the matter of the economy. Disturbingly, the three factions once again can't find common ground. The moderates want to nationalise the economy and have them be controlled by way of the government, letting the people influence it through the elections on the central government. The syndicalists reject this idea and argue that the economy should be decentralised instead, letting the workers in one means of production decide over their own production through a trade union instead without influence of the government. The maximists take the middle ground, accepting the syndicalist plan to syndicalise the economy in its entirety but rejecting the notion that these unions should not be bound by government interference, lest they be needed for the national interest."
nor_syncon.3.a:0 "A Syndicalised Economy."
nor_syncon.3.b:0 "A Nationalised Economy."
nor_syncon.3.c:0 "A Guided Syndicalised Economy."

nor_syncon.4.t:0 "Landsorganisasjonen - The Youth"
nor_syncon.4.d:0 "The confederation agrees that the educational system should be changed as well in the coming years. The syndicalists want to educate the youth about the revolution and socialist thought, and the importance to cherish the freedom the Norwegian worker bled for and to defend it, while the maximists instead want to focus the political curriculum on the general secretary - a cult of personality of sorts. The moderates meanwhile reject the politicisation of the educational system, and argue for it to be purified from elements focused on keeping the proletariat down installed by the plutocratic government of old but that it be kept neutral going from there."
nor_syncon.4.a:0 "The Revolution should be cherished by the youth!"
nor_syncon.4.b:0 "A neutral and objective educational system is what's needed."
nor_syncon.4.c:0 "The youth should venerate the Chairman!"

nor_syncon.5.t:0 "Electing the Chairman of the State"
nor_syncon.5.d:0 "Against all odds, the once fringe faction of Albin Eines has achieved a total victory during the conference of the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation, the Landsorganisasjonen. As such, it surprised few that Albin Eines run for chairman went unopposed, with the leaders of the other factions unwilling to execute the maximist plans that came out of this conference."
nor_syncon.5.a:0 "Albin Eines is the new Chairman!"

nor_syncon.6.t:0 "Electing the Chairman of the State"
nor_syncon.6.d:0 "The moderate faction of Einar Gerhardsen had always been the favourite to win in these elections, holding sway among a large part of the Norwegians loyal to the nation. After several successes in the policy debates, Gerhardsen's rivals have caved and dropped out of the race, sitting their opposition to the new government of Norway. The election of Gerhardsen as Norway's chairman is all but assured."
nor_syncon.6.a:0 "Gerhardsen shall be a splendid Chairman."

nor_syncon.7.t:0 "Electing the Chairman of the State"
nor_syncon.7.d:0 "The Syndicalists stood victorious in several policy debates in the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation. With a majority of their latest proposals having been approved, it turns out that Norway is moving towards an orthodox syndicalist path. Elias Volan is now the only one to realistically become chairman, with the others dropping out or turning out to be too fringe to have a chance."
nor_syncon.7.a:0 "Volan for a safe syndicalist Norway!"

nor_syncon.8.t:0 "Electing the Chairman of the State"
nor_syncon.8.d:0 "Sectarianism clearly runs rife within the Norwegian state, because no majority has been found. As a result, the race for chairman is still extremely competitive, with both the maximist leader Albin Eines and moderate leader Einar Gerhardsen still being in it, a surprising turn of events considering the fringeness of the totalist spectre once. The last votes are being tallied and it appears that..."

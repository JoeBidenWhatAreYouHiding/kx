NOR_railway_act:0 "Pass the Infrastructure Act"
NOR_railway_act_desc:0 "Since the time of the Vikings, the sea has been our main method our transportation. Goods and people have been moved along our long coastline by ship and many coastal villages still lack proper road connections even today. We should seek to address this problem by passing a grand Infrastructure Bill. Let us tie our country together through road and rail."
NOR_south_industry_1:0 "Expand the Christiania Spigerverk"
NOR_south_industry_1_desc:0 "The Christiania Nail Works is a steel company with a history dating back to 1853. They are one of the largest companies in Norway and a crucial part of our plans for industrialisation. Let us expand their facilities and greatly improve our industrial capabilities."
NOR_north_infrastructure:0 "The Northern Railway"
NOR_north_infrastructure_desc:0 "Northern Norway is a pretty isolated due to the length of our country and the lack of proper infrastructure. The Nordland Line, a rail connection between Trondheim and Bodø, has been planned since 1882, but the construction has proceeded at a very slow pace. If we are to exploit the wealth of resources in the north, we need to accelerate its construction."
NOR_industrial_census:0 "SSB and the Industrial Census"
NOR_industrial_census_desc:0 "The Norwegian Bureau of Statistics conducts all types of censuses every year. By conducting a National Industrial Census, we can better exploit our limited industrial potential."
NOR_north_industry:0 "Industrialise the North"
NOR_north_industry_desc:0 "Most of the cities in northern Norway are primarily concerned with agriculture, fishing and other basic forms of industry. If we encourage the construction of proper industry, we can be sure to increase our industrial output and bring prosperity to the area."
NOR_norsk_jernverk:0 "A/S Norsk Jernverk"
NOR_norsk_jernverk_desc:0 "Norway has the resources and technological knowledge to be self-sufficient in regards to iron and steel.

NOR_south_industry_2:0 "Support Norsk Hydro"
NOR_south_industry_2_desc:0 "Norsk Hydro, founded in 1905 by Sam Eyde and Kristian Birkeland, is the crown jewel of Norwegian industry. From the production of fertiliser and aluminium, to the production of heavy water, Hydro is an industrial behemoth. As the only notable Norwegian company on the international stage, we should further encourage its expansion."
NOR_aluminium_industry:0 "Norsk Aluminium Company"
NOR_aluminium_industry_desc:0 "Due to the abundance of cheap hydroelectric power, Norway is one of the world's leading producers of aluminium. Norsk Aluminium Company is one of the larger producers in the country.

NOR_limited_rearmament:0 "Defensive Rearmament"
NOR_limited_rearmament_desc:0 "It is a public secret that our military spending have remained inadequate since the dissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905.

NOR_weapon_industry_1:0 "Raufoss Ammunisjonsfabrikk"
NOR_weapon_industry_1_desc:0 "The Raufoss Ammunition Plant, established in 1896, is one of the few weapons manufacturers in Norway. If we would like to increase our production of rifles and cartridges, expanding the plant seems like a natural course of action."
NOR_weapon_industry_2:0 "Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk"
NOR_weapon_industry_2_desc:0 "The Kongsberg Weapons Factory has a history dating back to our independence in 1814. The producer of the famed 'Krag-Jørgensen' rifle, which was even adopted by the United States from 1892 to 1903, 'KV' has proven both reliability and ingenuity. We should expand the factory to further assist in the production of weapons to our armed forces."
NOR_extra_tech_slot:0 "Establish the FFI"
NOR_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "Norway has for a long time lacked a proper institution for the development of military equipment and advanced technology. The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment will be a governmental institution dedicated to the development of said technology."

NOR_oil_industry:0 "Vallø Oljeraffineri"
NOR_oil_industry_desc:0 "The Vallø Oil Refinery is the only oil refinery in Norway. Since Norway lack any domestic oil sources, our demands must be met either through trade or the production of synthetic fuel.

NOR_glomma_line:0 "Upgrade the Glomma Line"
NOR_glomma_line_desc:0 "The Glomma Line is a series of fortifications along the Swedish border. Constructed to guard against Sweden in case of outbreak of war in 1905, the fortifications were mostly dismantled after the peaceful resolution to the conflict.

NOR_naval_rearmament:0 "The 1936 Fleet Plan"
NOR_naval_rearmament_desc:0 "Our naval commanders have proposed a new plan for the Norwegian navy. The 1936 fleet plan will focus on industrial construction before specialising at a later date. This would greatly increase our naval potential."
NOR_large_navy:0 "Panserskip and Cruisers"

NOR_heavy_cruisers_desc:0 "Our fleet of Panserskip have been criticised for being obsolete. While our ships are indeed old, the Panserskip-concept isn't. We need the very model of a modern navy Panserskip."
NOR_small_navy:0 "U-boats and Destroyers"

NOR_navy_airforce:0 "Upgrade the Navy Air Service"

NOR_SYN_nationalise_economy:0 "Nationalise the Economy"

NOR_SYN_forced_haakon_removal_desc:0 "Haakon, or prince Carl of Denmark as he is actually known, has been good for Norway, insofar that is possible with this snobbish class that are the noblemen.

### Events ###
norway.1.t:0 "The State of Norway"
norway.1.d:0 "Norway is standing at a crossroad in history. While the nation is relatively prosperous, civil society is plagued by political infighting and stagnation. The left is divided as a result of schisms within in the once dominant Labour party. In 1921 the moderate faction broke away and formed the Social Democratic Labour Party, while the radical syndicalist wing broke away to form the Norwegian Syndicalist Federation in 1923. In addition, the Norwegian Communist Party is struggling and there are rumours about forming a new vanguard party of the far left, based upon the principles of National-Syndicalism. On the opposite end of the political spectrum, several nationalist organisations are jockeying for power and influence. While they are somewhat united in their opposition to socialism, their means and goals differ. While the political infighting has not resulted in violence, the ruling Liberal party is mostly powerless to handle pressing issues due to its minority government. As dark clouds are gathering once more over Europe, the people are anxiously awaiting the election in October 1936."
norway.1.a:0 "Enig og tro til Dovre faller."

norway.2.t:0 "Trade Mission to Japan"
norway.2.d:0 "The lack of international trade has crippled the Norwegian economy since 1925. One of the underlying issues is the lack of work for our large merchant navy. A bright individual in the foreign department has recently proposed reaching out to the Empire of Japan, as it could prove a market for our dried-fish and whaling trade. We could also lease some merchant ships to the Japanese at favourable rates. If successful, an agreement would provide much needed contracts for our merchant navy."
norway.2.a:0 "Send a trade delegation."
norway.2.b:0 "The idea is ridiculous."

norway.3.t:0 "Mission from Norway"
norway.3.d:0 "We recently received a trade delegation from the Kingdom of Norway. The country seeks new trading partners as it is not a part of the German 'Reichspakt' that dominates trade on the European mainland. They seek to trade, among other things, dried-fish and have offered us very favourable rates on Norwegian merchant shipping. Most of our trade experts are in favour of accepting, while a few oppose the use of foreign shipping in moving Japanese goods."
norway.3.a:0 "We won't refuse a good deal."
norway.3.b:0 "Politely decline."

norway.4.t:0 "Norvego-Japanese Trade Agreement of 1936"
norway.4.d:0 "Our proposal for a trade agreement has been accepted by the Japanese government and was signed in Tokyo this morning. It will provide much needed relief for parts of our economy."
norway.4.a:0 "Great!"

norway.5.t:0 "The Japanese Decline"
norway.5.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Japanese government has declined our trade agreement. It seems we will have to find other markets for our industry."
norway.5.a:0 "Apparently, the idea was ridiculous after all..."

norway.6.t:0 "End of the NKP"
norway.6.d:0 "Today the NKP, the Norwegian Communist Party, disbanded itself. Having failed to capitalise on the current economic crisis, the party decided to disband itself and have its members join the newly created Norwegian National-Syndicalist Party. Based upon the new teaching of politicians such as Benito Mussolini and Oswald Mosley, popularly known as "Totalism", the party hopes to aspire to greater things than communism ever proved capable of."
norway.6.a:0 "Yet another party of the left?"

norway.7.t:0 "Protests Against Farm Foreclosures"
norway.7.d:0 "The current economic crisis has caused a lot of farmers to default on their loans and mortgages. As a result, their livestock and property is normally auctioned away to the highest bidder by local authorities. The practise is deeply unpopular among Norwegian farmers, but its proponents claim that debts must be repaid and that the auctions are a necessary evil in a free market economy. Yesterday, the Farmers Party proposed a bill that would ban the auctions. What is the governments position on the issue?"
norway.7.a:0 "Allow the auctions to continue."
norway.7.b:0 "Pass the bill and ban the auctions."

norway.8.t:0 "The Birth of Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp"
norway.8.d:0 "Today, a loose grouping of landowners, farmers and right-wing politicians announced the establishment of Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp. Partly political and partly economic, the goal of the organisation is to oppose the farm auctions and aid farmers in need. Questions have already been raised regarding its independence, as its founders are all members of the party Nasjonal Samling. While some newspapers have praised its creation, others are denouncing the organisation as nothing more than a ploy to increase support for Nasjonal Samling in rural areas."
norway.8.a:0 "Unfortunate."

norway.9.t:0 "Quisling's Speech"
norway.9.d:0 "Vidkun Quisling, a former minister of defence and the leader of the paternal autocratic party Nasjonal Samling, recently held a public rally. In his speech, Quisling denounced the government for both its handling of the economic crisis and the lack of measures taken against the Norwegian syndicalists. He encouraged his supporters to join Samfundsvernet, a conservative paramilitary organisation, claiming that Samfundsvernet and Nasjonal Samling was Norway's last line of defence against syndicalism."
norway.9.a:0 "Last line against syndicalism? Really...?"

norway.10.t:0 "Samfundsvernet and the State"
norway.10.d:0 "Since Samfundsvernet was founded in 1923, the paramilitary organisation has been a bulwark against syndicalism. Although controlled and supported by conservative and nationalist circles, it was even granted status as reserve-police by the Police Act of 1928. However, Quisling's recent speech has filled its ranks with his supporters and radicalised the organisation. Several voices have raised concern regarding this development and wants us to curtail the organisation."
norway.10.a:0 "Revoke their status and suppress the organisation."
norway.10.b:0 "They are a defence against Syndicalism."

norway.11.t:0 "Failure at Suppression"
norway.11.d:0 "Our attempts at suppressing Samfundsvernet have failed. The right-wing parties would not accept any compromise regarding the organisation, while the left-wing parties demanded an outright ban. As a result, we couldn't build a parliamentary majority on the issue."
norway.11.a:0 "They will remain a danger..."

norway.12.t:0 "The Formation of Red Guards"
norway.12.d:0 "Our intelligence service is reporting that the syndicalist parties and trade unions are covertly organising paramilitary red guards. While this is most likely a response to the radicalisation of Samfundsvernet, it is an unsettling development."
norway.12.a:0 "What can we do..."

norway.13.t:0 "Influence from the UoB"
norway.13.d:0 "The Union of Britain has begun influencing our political system. It seems they are supporting syndicalist groupings with funds and attempting to undermine the legitimacy of our democracy in the left-wing press."
norway.13.a:0 "Damned syndicalists!"

norway.14.d:0 "Today, the Norwegian people elects a new parliament. The election is tightly fought and will decide the course of Norway in the foreseeable future. There are four possible outcomes. First of all, the radical-socialist Labour Party is campaigning on a platform of socialist reform. The Society Guard has declared that such a victory would force their hand, whatever that means. Another possibility is the social democratic Labour Party in coalition with the Liberal Party. Furthermore, the market liberal Conservatives could gain power with the Farmers party. Who will win?"
norway.14.a:0 "The Radical-Socialists wins a Plurality."
norway.14.b:0 "The Social-Democrats and Liberals gain a Majority."
norway.14.c:0 "The Conservatives and Farmers Party forms a Coalition."

norway.15.t:0 "Choosing the Prime Minister"
norway.15.d:0 "After gaining a suprising plurality in the election, the Labour party will now attempt to form a minority government. There are two candidates for the post of Prime Minister. Olav Scheflo, the party leader, is the natural choice for the post. However, some are calling for the more moderate Sverre Støstad to lead the government. Who is the new Prime Minister?"
norway.15.a:0 "Olav Scheflo, the party chief."
norway.15.b:0 "Sverre Støstad, the moderate socialist."

norway.16.t:0 "The Conservatives Protest"
norway.16.d:0 "The conservative and far-right parties have issued a formal protest against the formation of a radical Labour government. The claim said government is a threat to the stability of the nation and demand that the king appoints someone else. However, the king is not inclined to break with parliamentary procedure and has stated that 'I am also king for the syndicalists'."
norway.16.a:0 "It is the will of the people!"

norway.17.t:0 "Choosing the Prime Minister"
norway.17.d:0 "After gaining a majority in the election, the social-democratic Labour Party will form a government together with the Liberal Party. There are two candidates for the post of Prime Minister. The favourite, Magnus Nilssen, has lead the party since splitting from the radicals in 1921. The other option is the charismatic parliamentarian, Johan Nygaardsvold, who is wanted by younger members of the party. Who is the new Prime Minister?"
norway.17.a:0 "Magnus Nilssen, the party leader."
norway.17.b:0 "Johan Nygaardsvold, darling of the young guard."

norway.18.t:0 "Choosing the Prime Minister"
norway.18.d:0 "After forming a coalition with the Farmers Party, the Conservative Party will now form a government. There are two candidates for the post of Prime Minister. Carl Joachim Hambro, the able and experienced party veteran, and Johan Henrik Andresen, the famous industrialist. Who is the new Prime Minister?"
norway.18.a:0 "Carl Joachim Hambro, president of the Storting."

norway.20.a:0 "Our democracy is strong."

norway.22.t:0 "Governor Rygg Critise the Government"
norway.22.d:0 "Nicolai Rygg, former minister of finance and the current governor of the Norwegian Central Bank, has begun to harshly criticise the government in public. Acording to Rygg, the country is bound for economic devastation and he strongly encourage the opposition to defeat the government. Governor Rygg is quite the influental man and his opposition is bound to be shared by the established political parties."
norway.22.a:0 "Why won't he shut up?"

norway.23.t:0 "The Scope of Socialist Reform"
norway.23.d:0 "With our party in government, we need to decide upon the scope of our reform agenda. As we only have a parliamentary plurality, we would need support from other parties to pass the laws. A majority of our party wants to enact some limited labour legislation, including work hours and safety regulations, that would easily gain support from the social democrats and liberals. A minority believes we should exploit our recent electoral victory and attempt to push for nationalisation of critical industries. While such a plan won't easily pass parliament, it could perhaps garner some support from certain right-wing elements."
norway.23.a:0 "Minor Reform. Enact some labour legislation."
norway.23.b:0 "Major Reform. Nationalise critical industries."

norway.24.t:0 "Quisling and Samfundsvernet Mobilise"
norway.24.d:0 "This morning, Vidkun Quisling occupied at studio at the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and started broadcasting on the radio. He announced that parliament would pass a motion of no confidence against the government the following day. To keep the peace and secure an orderly transition of power, Samfundsvernet would mobilise and protect important public institutions. In the end, Quisling justified these actions by blaiming the government for its dangerous, revolutionary plans.\n\nAs the guardsmen took to the street, the police refused to take action. Clashes soon developed between guardsmen and worker's militias as the situation rapidly escalated."

norway.26.t:0 "The Hour of Decision!"
norway.26.d:0 "As the battle of Oslo rages for the third day, power hangs in the balance. Both sides have a certain claim to legitimacy and whoever captures the capital will likely control the country. The worker's guards claim to be defending the legitimate government, while Samfundsvernet wish to enable the parliamentary downfall of said government. At the same time, in light of the crisis, the King has fled to Canada. As the battle reaches its climax..."

Unfortunately, four of our 'Panserskip' are in a quite bad shape. Having been acquired between 1897 and 1901, the lack of upgrades and proper maintenance has severely limited their usefulness. They are currently mothballed and the navy is awaitning word on their fate. What shall we do with our ships?"

norway.112.d:0 "Our recent investments into 'Det Norske Luftfartselskap' has opened up several possibilities for our flag carrier. We could focus on the domestic market and try to bind Norway together by air. By investing in new airports and routes, we can move people, goods and mail much faster.

norway.190.t:0 "Norway wants to join our alliance."
norway.190.d:0 "Norway has approached us with the intention of signing a mutual defence agreement. In practice, the agreement would make Norway a member of our sphere. While we would become responsible for the defence of territories on the European mainland, we would also improve our strategic position. The Norwegian coast is long and crucial to conduct operations into the North Atlantic and the North Sea."

norway.230.t:0 "The Return of the King?"
norway.230.d:0 "When the nation fell into crisis and we fought the socialist dogs, King Haakon and his family fled into exile, fearing for their lives. While the Monarchy is popular, and their fear was perhaps not unfounded, this flight was seen as cowardly and even a capitulation by many in our nation. Now that we have restored order to Norway, this issue has become one of far greater importance and we must decided how we will treat the King. Will we invite him to return as most wish, thus making peace with the establishment and allowing Quisling to rule as Prime Minister? Or shall we listen to the wishes of the hardliners and make Quisling the undisputed dictator of Norway, ending the monarchy?"
norway.230.a:0 "The Monarchy Stays!"

norway.231.t:0 "The Status of the Storting"
norway.231.d:0 "When Quisling suspended the Storting, he did so on a indefinite basis, leaving some to hope that perhaps the institution would someday return. Now that the Monarchy has been restored and Quisling made Prime Minister, many are calling for the reintroduction of Parliamentary rule as well. Though recent events would give this new Parliament a more authoritarian character, it would nonetheless represent a boost to the legitimacy and popularity of Quisling’s government. On the other hand, there are some who claim that the current situation is too unstable to allow a return to parliamentary rule and that we must maintain authoritarianism. What is our final decision on the matter?"
norway.231.a:0 "Restore parliamentary rule."
norway.231.b:0 "The Storting stays suspended."

norway.232.t:0 "The Status of the Althing?"
norway.232.d:0 "The Althing is amongst the most ancient deliberative bodies in the world, and the most prized political institution of the Icelandic people. Nevertheless, its continued existence is problematic to our administration of the island, representing a parallel authority that we cannot tolerate, even if its present members have been picked to be friendly to our administration. At the present time, the two current proposals for dealing with the body are to either reform it as a consultative assembly subject to the metropole, or to abolish it entirely. The first is politically expedient, but would slightly limit our control over island affairs, while the latter maximizes our control but will prove unpopular with the natives. Which will we choose?"
norway.232.a:0 "The Althing stays as a consultative assembly."
norway.232.b:0 "The Althing is totally abolised."

norway.233.t:0 "Quisling Proclaims a New Norway"
norway.233.d:0 "With the abolition of the Monarchy, the time has come for Quisling to announce the future direction of the Norwegian State at a grand rally celebrating \"The New Norway\". Those conservatives amongst his base of support call for him to establish a one-party state with Quisling as its Dictator, while retaining much of the existing administration and legislation. In contrast, the radicals in the Nasjonal Samling call for a new system of government based on Germanic Philosophy and National Populist doctrine, where Quisling would rule as the totalitarian \"Forer\" of Norway. As Quisling addresses the crowd he announces that he will rule as…"
norway.233.a:0 "…President for Life of the Norwegian State."
norway.233.b:0 "…Forer of the Norwegian State."

norway.234.t:0 "The Forer’s Will"
norway.234.d:0 "Now that Quisling has taken power as the new Forer of the Norwegian State, he must decide to what ends he will use his newfound powers. Will he heed the conservatives and focus on internal stability, or will he listen to the radicals and use the powers of the Forerhood to re-shape Norway towards the pursuit of an empire to rival that of Haakon the Old?"
norway.234.a:0 "Norway must be reshaped so that it may fulfill its true destiny."

norway.320.t:0 "The Abolition of the Monarchy"
norway.320.d:0 "With full control over the politics of Norway, the Labour party steams ahead. Now the question comes of King Haakon, who many want to see dethroned. Though the Danish prince proved himself friendly to or at the very least not biased against socialism, yet some say the monarchy is an archaic method of the forces of reaction to control the people and must therefore be abolished. Should we keep the Monarchy?"
norway.320.a:0 "Declare the Republic!"

norway.321.d:0 "It has come to our attention that the Fagoppositions Samnsluting, the largest syndicalist organisation in Denmark, has recently received large amount of funds originating from shady sources.

And on the homefront, civilians help their soldiers to the best of their ability. While the Swedes outgun us and overpower us in terms of manpower, we shall make up for what we miss materially in spirit!\n\nWe shall go on to the end, we shall fight in Sweden, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our fylker, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight in the fjords, we shall fight on the border, we shall fight in the forests and in the streets, we shall fight in the mountains; we shall never surrender."

nor_syncon.1.t:0 "Landsorganisasjonen - Foreign Policy"
nor_syncon.1.d:0 "As per the new constitution, the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation has been made the primary democratic institution of the new Norwegian people's state. Today they have assembled for the first time to decide on the foreign policy of this new nation for the coming years. Three factions within the confederation have solidified; the moderates, the closest to a continuation of the Labour Party, led by Einar Gerhardsen, the orthodox syndicalists of the NSF, led by Elias Volan and finally the maximists, basing themselves on the party of the same name in Britain, led by Albin Eines. Today we vote on foreign policy, and all three factions have their own ideas on this matter. The moderates consider the defence of the nation the most important, and call for a defensive attitude, while the syndicalists consider it our sacred duty to help the internationale liberate the rest of the world. Lastly, the totalists want our foreign policy to focus on Sweden, as according to them, our Swedish neighbour could well doom Norway if handled inadequately."
nor_syncon.1.a:0 "It is our duty to export the revolution with the Brits and French!"
nor_syncon.1.b:0 "The Defence of the Nation is Paramount!"
nor_syncon.1.c:0 "Without Sweden pacified, Norway will never be safe!"

nor_syncon.2.t:0 "Landsorganisasjonen - Military Matters"
nor_syncon.2.d:0 "With the question of foreign policy resolved, the discussion has moved on to military matters. The moderates consider the old manner of military organisation not fit for the revolutionary status quo and want to make officer posts elected amongst the soldiers they lead. The syndicalists fear this will lead to popular but untalented officers to rise to the top at the cost of military efficiency but agree that some kind of democratic control is needed, and therefore argue in favour of reorganising our military into a trade union, where the soldiers elect representatives in a 'board' that instead assigns officers throughout the military. The maximists reject both attempts at democratizing the military, which according to them will only result in inefficiency where it is least needed, and defend the status quo, preferring a traditional army."
nor_syncon.2.a:0 "The syndicalists control the debate!"
nor_syncon.2.b:0 "The moderates win the day!"

nor_syncon.3.t:0 "Landsorganisasjonen - The Economy"
nor_syncon.3.d:0 "Now the confederation has arrived to the matter of the economy. Disturbingly, the three factions once again can't find common ground. The moderates want to nationalise the economy and have them be controlled by way of the government, letting the people influence it through the elections on the central government. The syndicalists reject this idea and argue that the economy should be decentralised instead, letting the workers in one means of production decide over their own production through a trade union instead without influence of the government. The maximists take the middle ground, accepting the syndicalist plan to syndicalise the economy in its entirety but rejecting the notion that these unions should not be bound by government interference, lest they be needed for the national interest."

The syndicalists want to educate the youth about the revolution and socialist thought, and the importance to cherish the freedom the Norwegian worker bled for and to defend it, while the maximists instead want to focus the political curriculum on the general secretary - a cult of personality of sorts. The moderates meanwhile reject the politicisation of the educational system, and argue for it to be purified from elements focused on keeping the proletariat down installed by the plutocratic government of old but that it be kept neutral going from there."
nor_syncon.4.a:0 "The Revolution should be cherished by the youth!"
nor_syncon.4.b:0 "A neutral and objective educational system is what's needed."
nor_syncon.4.c:0 "The youth should venerate the Chairman!"

nor_syncon.5.t:0 "Electing the Chairman of the State"
nor_syncon.5.d:0 "Against all odds, the once fringe faction of Albin Eines has achieved a total victory during the conference of the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation, the Landsorganisasjonen. As such, it surprised few that Albin Eines run for chairman went unopposed, with the leaders of the other factions unwilling to execute the maximist plans that came out of this conference."
nor_syncon.5.a:0 "Albin Eines is the new Chairman!"

nor_syncon.6.t:0 "Electing the Chairman of the State"
nor_syncon.6.d:0 "The moderate faction of Einar Gerhardsen had always been the favourite to win in these elections, holding sway among a large part of the Norwegians loyal to the nation. After several successes in the policy debates, Gerhardsen's rivals have caved and dropped out of the race, sitting their opposition to the new government of Norway. The election of Gerhardsen as Norway's chairman is all but assured."
nor_syncon.6.a:0 "Gerhardsen shall be a splendid Chairman."

nor_syncon.7.t:0 "Electing the Chairman of the State"
nor_syncon.7.d:0 "The Syndicalists stood victorious in several policy debates in the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation. With a majority of their latest proposals having been approved, it turns out that Norway is moving towards an orthodox syndicalist path. Elias Volan is now the only one to realistically become chairman, with the others dropping out or turning out to be too fringe to have a chance."
nor_syncon.7.a:0 "Volan for a safe syndicalist Norway!"

nor_syncon.8.t:0 "Electing the Chairman of the State"
nor_syncon.8.d:0 "Sectarianism clearly runs rife within the Norwegian state, because no majority has been found. As a result, the race for chairman is still extremely competitive, with both the maximist leader Albin Eines and moderate leader Einar Gerhardsen still being in it, a surprising turn of events considering the fringeness of the totalist spectre once. The last votes are being tallied and it appears that..."
nor_syncon.8.a:0 "...Albin Eines is Norway's new chairman."
nor_syncon.8.b:0 "...the moderate approach of Einar Gerhardsen won out!"

nor_syncon.9.t:0 "Electing the Chairman of the State"
nor_syncon.9.d:0 "Sectarianism clearly runs rife within the Norwegian state, because no majority has been found. As a result, the race for chairman is still extremely competitive, with both the syndicalist leader Elias Volan and moderate leader Einar Gerhardsen still being in it, which probably isn't too surprising an outcome. The last votes are being tallied and it appears that..."
nor_syncon.9.a:0 "...Elias Volan is elected Chairman."
nor_syncon.9.b:0 "...Einar Gerhardsen wins out after all."

nor_syncon.10.t:0 "Electing the Chairman of the State"
nor_syncon.10.d:0 "Sectarianism clearly runs rife within the Norwegian state, because no majority has been found. As a result, the race for chairman is still extremely competitive, with both the maximist leader Albin Eines and moderate leader Elias Volan still being in it, a surprising turn of events considering the fringeness of the totalist spectre once. The last votes are being tallied and it appears that..."
nor_syncon.10.a:0 "...an antitotalist coalition elects Elias Volan."
nor_syncon.10.b:0 "...Albin Eines is Norway's new chairman."

### Focuses ###
GRU_breitspurbahnen:0 "Breitspurbahnen"
GRU_breitspurbahnen_desc:0 "While the Old Empire did little for us and for the German worker, at the very least it's undeniable it had done wonders to improve its infrastructure. However the Kaiser as usual had not done enough. Today we are beginning work on a grand and ambitious program, the Breitspurbahnen or Double Gauge Railway, which will link the cities of our nation with large gauge railways carrying our noble citizens on grand Hotels of the Rails, the double decker railroad coaches. It will be a time consuming project as much of the existing railway has to be torn up as well to be remade to fit with our new ones, but the time taken will be earned back ten fold by the speed and safety we will achieve on our new rails."
GRU_welfare:0 "People's Welfare"
GRU_welfare_desc:0 "The Kaiser served not the worker but the Junker nobility who did nothing but oppress us! This was perfectly demonstrated with his not only inability to do anything to alleviate our suffering during Black Monday, but also his outright refusal to do so! Now with the worker in power we will remedy his mistakes! We shall institute a generous welfare program to alleviate the plight of the common man using funds seized from the decadent Junkers."
GRU_Germany_Mighty_Proud:0 "Germany Mighty and Proud!"
GRU_Germany_Mighty_Proud_desc:0 "Through hard work, grit and determination we have built a mighty and proud Germany on the ashes of the old. Many thought that our goal was a failed one from the start, yet we have proven them wrong. However, there is still much to do before the German people can live in a true People's Empire with all their brothers and sisters."
GRU_Raise_Red_Knights:0 "Raise the Red Knights"
GRU_Raise_Red_Knights_desc:0 "While the army is certainly a vanguard of the nation, we cannot rely on it alone for it is often slow to respond and traitorous. To safeguard our internal revolution we shall form the Red Knights Company, the RRH. They will get the best training and equipment our state can provide in order to safeguard the people of Germany like the noble warriors of old."
GRU_Bismarckian_Kulturkampf:0 "Bismarckian Kulturkampf"
GRU_Bismarckian_Kulturkampf_desc:0 "The Church and other organizations associated with it are deeply ingrained into German society. This has given them a degree of power that we find unacceptable, especially since the Church denies our legitimacy. However, now with our government and situation stabilized, we feel secure enough to go after them. Dissident priests shall once again feel the wrath of a Bismarckian Kulturkampf if they do anything more than pray inside their rotten structures and among their false idols."
GRU_first_congress_of_german_unions:0 "First Congress of German Unions"
GRU_first_congress_of_german_unions_desc:0 "Today the National People's Union of Germany, the big tent coalition of Syndicalist and left leaning groups and unions that led the Revolution, has collapsed. With all its factions pulling it in radically different directions at the same time, it was only a wonder that it survived as long as it has. To prevent the nation from falling into anarchy the Government has called the First Congress of the German Unions to hash out the factions' differences and see which one will lead us into the future."
GRU_iva:0 "I.v.A."
GRU_iva_desc:0 "To begin the process of breaking down the old bourgeois order and building a new and equitable system, we shall start the Industrie Verstaatlichung Aktion, or I.v.A. to begin nationalizing the factories that dot our nation. In some areas like the Ruhr, where our Revolution began, this will be only a formality as workers unions seized their workspaces ages ago. However, in more conservative areas like Bavaria we might have to resort to force to detach the old order from their wealth."
GRU_rva:0 "R.v.A."
GRU_rva_desc:0 "To secure the foundation of our national prosperity the Government has begun the Ressourcen Verstaatlichung Aktion, or R.v.A, to seize the mines, saw mills and other raw resource producers for the greater good. This will be markedly easier than going straight after the factories as many of the blue collar labourers who made up the bulk of our Revolution worked in these areas. All it will be for the most part is putting a bureaucrat there to help the locals integrate more into the national economy."
GRU_New_Peoples_Cadet_Corps:0 "New People's Cadet Corps"
GRU_New_Peoples_Cadet_Corps_desc:0 "If Germany is to survive the coming trials we must forge the German youth into a noble and strong population. The past decades of prosperity have made our people fat and lazy, but the next generation is still able to be saved from themselves. To do this, Lensch authorized the creation of the Volkskadett Corp, or the People's Cadet Corps, which is an organization based on the Prussian military schools of days past. The VKC will also be compulsory so we can be sure all of Germany’s children will receive the right teaching."
GRU_New_Direction_UFA:0 "A New Direction for UFA"
GRU_New_Direction_UFA_desc:0 "Universum-Film AG, or simply just UFA, is a powerful tool in the right hands. Being the biggest media conglomerate inside Germany it would serve us well to nationalize them. That shall allow us to spread our vision across every single town and even village inside our nation."
GRU_faud_victory:0 "FAUD Victory"
GRU_faud_victory_desc:0 "During the First Congress the Free Workers Union of Germany, the Anarchists, have managed to take control. Promising nigh unlimited freedoms and complete liberation of the worker they have managed to secure their hold on the reigns of power. Its many critics describe them as anti-State Statists with all the contradictions and hypocrisy such a label brings. We will prove them wrong."
GRU_sepd_victory:0 "SMEPD Victory"
GRU_sepd_victory_desc:0 "After all the debating, shouting and accusing has come to an end we have elected the SMEPD, the remnants of the Big Tent coalition that once ruled the nation, has secured victory. While not totally unexpected and a continuation of the old powers, they still have many challenges ahead of them. Germany still reels from the War, the economy is in tatters and already the party is breaking into factions. All that remains is to see which one will lead us into our glorious victory."
GRU_GSVP_Victory:0 "GSVP Victory"
GRU_GSVP_Victory_desc:0 "In a massive shock, Paul Lensch and his minority GSVP has won out during the Congress. Electrifying delegates and the public alike with his fiery speeches he has done the seemingly impossible. Promising a unification of all Germans in spirit of a truly revolutionary yet conservative socialism, his victory is seen as a return to a strangely traditional model within our nation. His few supporters rejoice in the streets while the rest of the nation, and the world, looks on anxiously and wonders what this firebrand will do next."
GRU_kommandowirtschaft:0 "Kommandowirtschaft"
GRU_kommandowirtschaft_desc:0 "To leave the economy up to the individual is short sighted and inefficient. People are only out to help themselves and either do not or refuse to see the bigger picture. The Government must have total control over the economy because only the Government can see the bigger picture and also care for everybody. To do this we have established the Kommandowirtschaft, the Command Economy which will set up special 'Command Bureaus' to run sections of the economy according to Government orders."
GRU_Reform_Inlandsabteilung:0 "Reform the Inlandsabteilung"
GRU_Reform_Inlandsabteilung_desc:0 "During the time of the Weltkrieg the Abteilung III b was one of the powerful intelligence organizations in the Empire. It kept tabs on all dissidents within Germany while maintaining vigil against any foreign spy. We must surpass this legacy if we are to be truly secure. Our new intelligence agency, the Inlandsabteilung, will be charged with keeping tabs on all citizens both foreign and domestic while maintaining complete visibility over our future enemies abroad. By casting such a wide net, no enemy of the state will go unnoticed."
GRU_German_Unity_Without_Kaisers_Crown:0 "German Unity without the Kaiser's Crown"
GRU_German_Unity_Without_Kaisers_Crown_desc:0 "Many people still think that the German people and states within our nation were only ever unified thanks to one man. Ha, what a ridiculous notion. If we are to transform Germany fully we need to make clear to our people and the outside world that there is no need for a senile old man to keep the nation as a whole unit."
GRU_Triumph_Volkskanzler:0 "Triumph of the Volkskanzler"
GRU_Triumph_Volkskanzler_desc:0 "The time is right to take the final move to consolidate our leader's power. Our nation is under constant assault from outside forces and remaining reactionaries and traitors within. If we are to stand against them we need a unified symbol of strength. We shall consolidate the leadership positions inside the government into one, the Volkskanzler. This position will obviously be held by Lensch, the leader of our nation and the German people!"
GRU_spd_victory:0 "SPD-R Victory"
GRU_spd_victory_desc:0 "After much debate the SPD-R has emerged victorious. Led by Karl Liebknekt it promises Syndicalist democracy for all along with a radical expansion of rights. This has been met with derision and anger from the more radical aspects of our new nation but for the most part the people seem to support the new administration. Having only tasted autocracy for its history the German people are ready for true democracy to light a torch of freedom for all of Europe and the World to follow."
GRU_thalmann:0 "Thälmann"
GRU_thalmann_desc:0 "After a short power struggle within the SMPED the traditional Syndicalists have managed to beat out the old school Bolsheviks. As a radical departure from the Kaiser it is expected that the new Chairman will have a lot of work to do. Ahead of him Thalmann will have to build a new society built of equity for the worker and equality for all where once strict stratification and autocracy ruled. With help from across the border and with preservation however it is inevitable the Workers Dream will come to Germany."
GRU_deutsche_syndikalisiische_republik:0 "Deutsche Syndikalistische Republik"
GRU_deutsche_syndikalisiische_republik_desc:0 "Up until now we have still maintained our declaration of an Emergency Socialist Government. However with the Revolution over and our power secured it's finally time to do away with the temporary faucets of our government and build a new, Syndicalist state with a new Constitution and radically new laws to reflect our new values."
GRU_syndicalist_education:0 "Syndicalist Education"
GRU_syndicalist_education_desc:0 "The old education system was built to uphold a system of oppression and degradation for the masses. If we are to liberate not only the present but the future we must retool our ancient education system to teach the values of equality, liberation and solidarity with our children’s comrades."
GRU_pieck:0 "Pieck"
GRU_pieck_desc:0 "After a short power struggle in SMEPD the Old Bolsheviks have emerged victorious over the Classic Syndicalists. Loyal to the ideals of Lenin and the failed Russian Revolution they aim to do what Lenin could not and create a dictatorship of the proletariat in Germany. All will be equal and the Bolsheviks can once more become the vanguard of the Revolution like they were before the disgrace in Russia."
GRU_one_union:0 "One Union"
GRU_one_union_desc:0 "German trade unions are currently a mish mash of varying and sometimes competing organizations. Their incessant feuding has become a running joke among rightists as “the only thing a Union man hates more than a capitalist is another Union man”. To remedy this problem we will reorganize all of Germany’s unions along a new and strict regimen. United in structure and purpose they can stand together as a bulwark against counterrevolution."
GRU_integration:0 "Integration"
GRU_integration_desc:0 "In our new Germany there will be a place for all, none should be without work. Some economists say this is literally impossible and if possible, bad for the economy but we will show them wrong. We shall send agents out across Germany to establish permanent (and compulsory for the unemployed) job fairs so all those without jobs will get them. Once we are out of jobs, we will simply carve niches out of existing positions to make new jobs for the rest of them."
GRU_free_universities:0 "Syndicalist Universities"
GRU_free_universities_desc:0 "Education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don’t need little changes, we need gigantic, monumental changes. Schools should be palaces. Competition for the best teachers should be fierce; they should be making six figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for the government and absolutely free of charge to its citizens, just like national defense. In the Old Germany a university education was out of the question for the vast majority of people. Those who got said education formed an upper crust of lower society which kept the proletariat uneducated and subdued. In our new Germany all universities will be public and will be free! If a man or woman wants to learn about the world he inhabits there should be no barriers to his or her pursuit of that knowledge."
GRU_fortschritt:0 "Fortschritt!"
GRU_fortschritt_desc:0 "Our old nation was built on conservatism and reaction. Our new nation is a vanguard of progressivism! We have already done so much but there is still much more to do! Vorwärts, Genossen! In unsere neue und größere Zukunft!"
GRU_mfsp:0 "MfSP"
GRU_mfsp_desc:0 "The newly established Ministry of Special Projects has been founded to utilize the greatest minds of our country to keep us on the frontiers of civil and military sciences. Some of these bright minds have voiced concerns about our proposed projects and the destructive power they could entail, but they should shut up! We know that if we don’t create these inventions then someone else will and use them against us!."
GRU_neue_schwerindustrie:0 "Neue Schwerindustrie"
GRU_neue_schwerindustrie_desc:0 "Germany is the industrial heartland of Europe. Our factories are the greatest on the Continent and even rival or surpass the titans of America and Russia in efficiency. However our leaders have big plans for Germany’s future and if they are to achieve them then we must reach ever greater heights. That is why the government has aided our biggest factories in expanding even more while founding many more new factories across the nation."
GRU_spzproj_uran:0 "Spz.Proj. URAN"
GRU_spzproj_uran_desc:0 "Special Projekt URAN, led by Walter Gerlach, is the project aiming to use fissionable materials like uranium to create new sources of power. Another avenue is the creation of a long theorized uranium bomb which scientists predict could level entire cities with just one bomb. If their predictions are true then we must get this weapon before our enemies do. Who can resist us if our words are backed by nuclear weapons!"
GRU_spzprojpfeil:0 "Spz.Proj.PFEIL"
GRU_spzprojpfeil_desc:0 "Special Projekt PFEIL, named after the German word for arrow, is a top secret development project headed by Walther von Braun to create long range ballistic weapons. Dr von Braun has been petitioning the government for funding for a project like this since the Kaiser sat on his throne. Now with all the money he could want he assures us he will have a working V-1 Rocket ready within a few years at most. Von Braun himself aims for space though, we shall however aim for our enemies."
GRU_industrial_unionisation:0 "Industrial Unionization"
GRU_industrial_unionisation_desc:0 "In a move that has frankly taken too long to go through with, we shall nationalize all industries and hand their day to day operations to various unions across the nation. Following through on as basic a promise as this will be rather easy but will buy us miles of public sympathy from workers who have been alienated from their work for decades."
GRU_ressource_redistribution:0 "Resource Re-Distribution"
GRU_ressource_redistribution_desc:0 "To aid in the maximization of our resources we shall nationalize all our lands resources. Then we can organize them and efficiently distribute them across our nation as needed. This will keep some areas from hoarding vital resources while others starve and bring about a new age of efficiency within our industry."
GRU_union_trade_committee:0 "Union Trade Committee"
GRU_union_trade_committee_desc:0 "In accordance with the recently passed Law on the Organization of National Trade Unions a new Union Trade Committee will be founded. Led by a council of seven members it will mediate disputes between unions and upon the government's behest can assume leadership of all unions in Germany to better coordinate with the government in times of crisis."
GRU_agrarian_collectives:0 "Agrarian Communes"
GRU_agrarian_collectives_desc:0 "Much of the Junkers' money was found in land. They held vast estates with farms stretching over the horizon. Today these decrepit estates shall be broken up and handed over to local Agrarian Communes who can more easily administer their own land. Run and used by the locals it will also inspire a sense of pride and accomplishment as much of their own harvest will be left with them after the Government's quota."
GRU_artisan_communes:0 "Artisan Communes"
GRU_artisan_communes_desc:0 "Not even the arts can escape democratization. The elitist artistic world will be broken down and remade into a series of Artisan Communes where everything from the tools they use to the art they make will be the property of the Commune and the Country and for all to see. Government stipends and individual donations will keep these communes solvent as selling art deprives it from the proletariat."
GRU_einigkeit_recht:0 "Einigkeit, Recht....."
GRU_einigkeit_recht_desc:0 "The first two principles our new nation will be founded on are unity, the unification of the German people under the red banner of Syndicalism and Justice, the equalization of a long held discriminatory justice system. Now not only could the average citizen see his work affect the prosperity of his community and nation but now he knows that any wrongs against him will be solved through the justice system and restore some of his lost faith in the government who has long turned his back on him."
GRU_woman_suffrage:0 "Woman Suffrage"
GRU_woman_suffrage_desc:0 "In most of the world, and even Germany before our Revolution, women were treated as less than people. They were simply servants you can lay with and will have your children. This is a deeply misogynistic world view and completely against the views of our new Germany. As one of our first decrees since taking power, giving basic rights to women shows the world and the people just how committed to equality we are."
GRU_liberal_education:0 "Liberal Education"
GRU_liberal_education_desc:0 "The national education system is a mess and tries to hammer into our next generation that the deeply flawed system we overthrew was just and right and natural. All of this was sometimes done in lieu of actual education. More radical Congress members want to indoctrinate our kids like the Empire did, just into the correct system this time. However, we know to sink to their level will show us as no better than the oppressors we overthrew. Instead we will strip all political and religious themes from our education system and focus solely on the sciences."
GRU_higher_education_grants:0 "Higher Education Grants"
GRU_higher_education_grants_desc:0 "Intelligence does not restrict itself to those able to more able to afford to use it. We will establish government grants to allow the smartest of our poorer class to reach the highest levels of education for the benefit of the nation as a whole. WIth new opportunities the poorest among us can break the cycle of poverty and raise their new families from the squalor they suffered in."
GRU_antidiscriminatory_laws:0 "Anti-Discrimination Laws"
GRU_antidiscriminatory_laws_desc:0 "Bigotry is a poison spreading through all societies of the world and even within our movement, not anymore, we will make sure to eradicate all traces of it wherever it hides. All minorities, whether ethnic, religious or sexual, will see their right defended above all else, our new anarchist society will not accept any form of discrimination against anyone."
GRU_antiauthoritarian_education:0 "Anti-Authoritarian Education"
GRU_antiauthoritarian_education_desc:0 "Children are all unique. To shove them all in a room for eight hours a day and expect all of them to listen as a teacher drones on is foolish. Instead our leaders have found truth in the words of educator Maria Montessori, who believes in free thinking and self correction for students. We shall invite her to Berlin to help us form our new education system. Be it outside, hands on learning for the more physical amongst them or using the latest technology to ensnare their active imaginations in the vivid pictures of history we will grant our teachers the tools necessary to make our next generation the most educated in history."
GRU_communal_universities:0 "University Communes"
GRU_communal_universities_desc:0 "The classic interpretation of a University is way too rigid for our new Germany. Instead the university system will be replaced with an ecosystem of University Communes where students will not only receive the best education in Europe but will meet and converse with their peers and form bonds that will last the rest of their lives."
GRU_humane_pensions:0 "Humane Pensions"
GRU_humane_pensions_desc:0 "Our aging generation risked it all to form this new and free world. They have done the impossible and turned a world of backwards reaction and close mindedness into one where the worker walks freely and equally with even the highest government officials. For their sacrifices they must be rewarded in their much earned retirement. A new pension will be established for all retirees within our nation over the age of 65. It has been described as generous in excess but it is the least we could do for the Greatest Generation."
GRU_und_freiheit:0 "....und Freiheit"
GRU_und_freiheit_desc:0 "Freedom. Seven letters with a titanic amount of meaning. As the last of the four principles it is the most important. Our people will be free from oppression, free from want, free from need. Free from the horrors of war and free from the horrors of poverty. Free from discrimination at home and free from loss. The German people have finally tasted true and purely unfiltered Freedom and have grown to desire it. We would all rather die, down to the last man, woman and child, rather than give it up to another tyrant!"
GRU_socialmarket_economics:0 "Social-Market Economics"
GRU_socialmarket_economics_desc:0 "To continue the capitalistic economy under the Kaiser would be abetting in oppression. However, we acknowledge that those who worked hard under the previous system deserve to keep what they clawed from the bourgeois’s greedy hands. To take that away from them would wipe away any want or ambition in our people. To remedy this problem we have begun to build a new Social-Market Economy where private ownership is allowed but major industries are nationalized. Some denounce this is as capitalist oppression in red paint, but the results will speak for themselves."
GRU_worker_rights:0 "Worker Rights"
GRU_worker_rights_desc:0 "Without rights the Worker is just a slave. Their bosses would much rather they become slaves as that would lead to greater profits. However, as a modern and progressive society we cannot allow such barbarity. We shall spell out and enshrine workers rights to fair wages and to organize and create a new organization, Abteilung für Arbeitssicherheit, to oversee that these rights are never to be infringed. The AfA will have the power to close down offending businesses and levy steep fines against offending bosses. With this new power the boss will be forced to work with their workers and not lord over them."
GRU_support_startups:0 "Support Startups"
GRU_support_startups_desc:0 "Small businesses are the backbone of a modern economy, Syndicalist or not. To restore our nation's shattered economy we will start giving promising startups generous government grants to kickstart the economic recovery our people have been pleading for for so long."
GRU_german_industrial_miracle:0 "German Industrial Miracle"
GRU_german_industrial_miracle_desc:0 "Numbers don't lie and the numbers show that not only have we recovered from Black Monday but we have even begun to surpass economic output before the crash! This would’ve been impossible if we leaned too hard towards Syndicalism or turned to straightforward Capitalism. It's only the genius of our economic planning and collaboration with private sectors that we achieved such prosperity! We have saved Germany!."
GRU_return_to_the_worldstage:0 "Return to the World Stage"
GRU_return_to_the_worldstage_desc:0 "Now that we have solidified our rule at home and fixed our broken economy we can turn to our foreign ambitions. Germany before the Revolution was a world leader. While it was a world leader in oppression and reactionary violence, its power was undeniable and irresistible. We must take up its mantle as a world power, but now it will be in support of the Revolution and not fighting against it."
GRU_formation_of_the_nva:0 "Formation of the NVA"
GRU_formation_of_the_nva_desc:0 "Now that our industry is humming along at sufficient capacity we can turn to reorganizing our military into the National Volksarmee with three planned branches, the Nationale Volksmarine or the Navy, the Nationale Luftwaffe or Air Force and the Nationales Volksheer or the Army. This new NVA will be more modern and more effective than the old Imperial military could ever have been. They will be the defenders of the revolution at home and even abroad!"
GRU_nationales_volksheer:0 "Nationales Volksheer"
GRU_nationales_volksheer_desc:0 "The Nationales Volksheer is to be the land arm of our military. Its organization is still up to some debate but what is not up to debate is the primacy of the Volksheer in our new military. What we call our ‘army’ now is little more than a grouping of ragtag militia who have elected to not disband after the Civil War. It will take tremendous effort and more importantly, money to turn these militia into a professional and disciplined fighting force. However it must be done if our state is to be secure."
GRU_nationale_volksmarine:0 "Nationale Volksmarine"
GRU_nationale_volksmarine_desc:0 "The National Volksmarine is the naval branch of our new military. We received a few ships during the Civil War but they are still being run by a cobbled together hierarchy of sailors communes and self-administering ships. The ships themselves are also falling further behind in technology. Any respectable nation has a navy, and a great power like us must have a grand navy to rival all others if our seas are to be safe from foreign incursion."
GRU_nationale_luftwaffe:0 "Nationale Luftwaffe"
GRU_nationale_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The Nationale Luftwaffe will be the air force of our military. As the newest of our independent branches of the military this one will be the easiest to restructure. While the Army and Navy have centuries of tradition to uproot and turn almost entirely on its head, the Luftwaffe has only been around a few decades. The old Luftstriekcrafte is dead and from its ashes a new Luftwaffe will rise, proud and most importantly, Red."
GRU_skilled_officers:0 "Skilled Officers"
GRU_skilled_officers_desc:0 "One of the most basic questions of our new military is how we will recruit the officers. One camp argues that we must pursue the most skilled officers within our nation. Unfortunately many of the most skilled officers remaining in our nation are former Imperial officers. These men fought in Africa against the Mau Mau, against the Viet Minh in Indochina, or even in the Weltkrieg itself. Some worry that giving these men who gave their lives to the Kaiser power within our military would only invite counterrevolution. However, this is a risk we must take to make our military more effective."
GRU_elected_officers:0 "Elected Officers"
GRU_elected_officers_desc:0 "One of the most basic questions of our new military is how we will recruit the officers. Some have argued for us to not recruit officers for our soldiers. Instead we should allow our units to elect their own officers from within. These men would undoubtedly inspire loyalty within our units to their commanders and their country. These officers would be only minorly reviewed and as such presents one major problem. It's always a risk that our noble soldiers would just elect a slacker or a ‘good ol boy’ who wouldn’t discipline the troops as well. They could elect bad officers who don’t know how to lead. However this is a risk worth taking to placate our soldiers and show just how democratic our state is."
GRU_political_officers:0 "Political Officers"
GRU_political_officers_desc:0 "One of the most basic questions of our new military is how we will recruit the officers. A vocal part of our military argues for political officers, chosen for their loyalty rather than their credentials as an officer necessarily. They say the military, despite how vital it is, is also a traditional hub of counterrevolution. They point to the history of military leaders overthrowing progressive regimes in support of oppression. The risks of this are obvious as a political officer might be more interested in enforcing Party loyalty and ideological purity than actually leading his troops. This is a small sacrifice to make however if our state is to remain safe from opponents both foreign....and domestic."
GRU_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
GRU_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe will focus on building more and greater bombers. Bombing from the air is even newer than the concept of flight, only really taking off during the tail end of the Weltkrieg. However colonial conflicts abroad have shown the effectiveness of bombers. Their ability to drop tons of high explosives on enemy positions with little fear of retaliation make them an excellent force mitigator. Not only that but the morale effect of an endless rain of bombs is undeniable. As such, we shall fill the sky with our metal birds and crater the ground with their fiery rain of death!"
GRU_fighter_focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
GRU_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The concept of fighter aircraft is not new to us. They proved their use quickly in the Great War and have been a foundation of every air force in the world. By denying our enemy control of the skies we won't have to worry about their bombers terrorizing our soldiers and we could even send our bombers out instead. Not only that but German companies like Focke-Wulf and Messerschmitt have been recognized as some of the best fighter producers in the world. To turn our backs on them would be idiocy."
GRU_carrier_focus:0 "Carrier Focus"
GRU_carrier_focus_desc:0 "It's a simple fact that planes can travel much further than mere shells. Early tests done in the 1920s and early 1930s have suggested that seaplanes, or these so called ‘aircraft carriers’ with traditionally land based planes could revolutionize warfare at sea! We have recognized this and as a revolutionary government its only proper we have a revolutionary Navy. We will focus our efforts on building up Carrier fleets and using them to crush our enemies at sea before they can even see us."
GRU_battleship_focus:0 "Battleship Focus"
GRU_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Those with the biggest ships rule the seas. This has been an undisputed fact for thousands of years. Now however people begin to think planes and defenseless carriers could unseat the traditional kings of the oceans? Pah! We shall prove them all wrong! We will build titanic fortresses at sea with enough guns to sink an island! Anybody who challenges us will die under a hail of shells and salvos!"
GRU_panzertruppe:0 "Panzertruppe"
GRU_panzertruppe_desc:0 "As we rebuild our Army we have come to the conclusion that tanks and motorized vehicles are the future. Not only can they go faster than any man could ever hope to, a tank or truck only wants for fuel and parts. Not only that but they can even hold a whole squad or more of men and take them with them. Using their rapid movement and the tanks' hard hitting power, we can break through their lines and win through Bewegungskrieg or Maneuver Warfare."
GRU_panzergrenadiere:0 "Panzergrenadiere"
GRU_panzergrenadiere_desc:0 "Infantry have been the foundation of the army. Some say the new innovation of the tank should deprive them of this place of reverence. We shall relegate tanks to their true role as support for the true hammer of the Proletariat, the valiant infantry. Using vehicles they will achieve a sense of mobility unseen since Napoleon’s lighting campaigns through Italy and Germany. With adequate support these mechanized spearheads will be impossible to stop."
GRU_submarine_focus:0 "Submarine Focus"
GRU_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Submarines, or U-boats, did wonders in the last war and technology can only make them better for the next war. Unseen and deadly silent the enemy won't see them until they are already slipping under the sea on their burning wrecks. WIth enough wolf packs prowling the sea we can strangle any enemy into submission without even having to fire a shot on land"
GRU_cruiser_focus:0 "Cruiser Focus"
GRU_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "With our surface fleet growing exponentially we will need sufficient surface support. While u-boats proved their merit in the Weltkrieg, to use them in the next war would play directly into the enemy's hands. Anti-submarine warfare technology has grown by leaps and bounds. Instead we will focus on building surface ships like cruisers and destroyers to both protect our bigger ships while striking down the subs of our enemies."
GRU_oknvh:0 "OK-NVH"
GRU_oknvh_desc:0 "The Oberkommando Nationales Volksheer is just the latest iteration of the vaunted German General Staff. Its incessant planning and meticulous calculations have done our great nation wonders in the wars from the Franco-Prussian to the Weltkrieg. While the old General Staff is too reactionary and dissentious to be of much use, this has left us with a great opportunity. Doing away with those grey haired fossils will allow for younger minds with newer ideas to rise further through the ranks"

GRU_occupational_government_desc:0 "The German Empire is dead and rotting in the ground. The Kaiser has fled and his government has gone to ground. Now, we have been left with a new problem, the Kaiser’s people. They are people who lick boots for breakfast and piss shoe shine. To make them good Syndicalists is going to be an arduous task. The first step however is in some ways the hardest. We must give governance back to the Germans, under our watchful eye, to let them choose their future. One they might even learn to accept."
GRU_mass_conscription:0 "Overwhelming Numbers"
GRU_mass_conscription_desc:0 "After Russia our nation is the most populous in the world. This gives us a marked advantage over our enemies on the Continent. Some of our military theorists have argued that we must make use of these Human Waves or Menschenwelle, to drown our enemies in blood. Not only will we crush our enemies under their own dead bodies but the loss will forge our peoples spirit into one of iron and blood, able to take the losses necessary to achieve our destiny."
GRU_overwhelming_firepower:0 "Superior Firepower"
GRU_overwhelming_firepower_desc:0 "Artillery is a critical weapon on any modern battlefield. They can reduce walls and defenses in minutes and turn men into mulch in seconds. This has been known since Cannon was first used centuries ago. We shall equip all our units with their own artillery or mortars as is deemed appropriate so all our men can use this terrifying power to break their enemies before them."
GRU_oknvm:0 "OK-NVM"
GRU_oknvm_desc:0 "The Oberkommando Nationale Volksmarine will take over for the old Imperial Admiralty. The old Admiralty was fractious and divided and as such we had a rather lackluster performance at sea, worse than we should have been at the very least. To remedy this while the OK-NVM will itself be divided into several departments and such to better oversee the vastness of our navy, they will report to the Generalsstab-Marine, who will in turn consolidate everything into a report for a single man, the Chief of Naval Warfare, or CdF who will then make decisions. Some say this will be too much for one man to handle, but we know the power of a single man."
GRU_naval_support_focus:0 "Naval Support Focus"
GRU_naval_support_focus_desc:0 "While our navy is powerful it is still a fraction of what it was under the Kaiser. The navies of other nations dwarf ours in firepower and numbers. To remedy this situation the Luftwaffe will be ordered to primarily focus on supporting our valiant navy in its efforts to secure our seas. This may hamper its efforts to support the soldiers but the German Army has been unbeaten on land for decades, it doesn't need some metal birds to save it."
GRU_ground_support_focus:0 "Ground Support Focus"
GRU_ground_support_focus_desc:0 "As warfare has evolved control over the skies of the battlefield has become as necessary as control over something as basic as supplies. If our armies are to know victory we must make sure they won't have to spend half their time looking to the skies as well as ahead of them. To that end the Luftwaffe has been ordered to focus on supporting our ground troops in their advance. This has been said to be done at the detriment to our Navy’s actions at sea but our Navy is powerful enough that it doesn't need to cower from airborne threats."
GRU_oknlw:0 "OK-NLW"
GRU_oknlw_desc:0 "Oberkommando Nationale Luftwaffe will be founded to organize the Air Force and concentrate its efforts.

GRU_hydroelectric_power:0 "Hydroelectric Power"
GRU_hydroelectric_power_desc:0 "To sustain our massive industrial power we need more energy, electricity. We have gained much of that from fossil fuels but much of it comes from imports. This leaves us vulnerable to the whims of other powers. To remedy this situation somewhat we shall develop our hydroelectric capacity. Germany has many rivers from large ones to the Rhine and the Elbe, to smaller ones like the Oder. We shall build as many dams as we can among them to draw nature's latent power from and harness that power into an industrial machine that can move heaven and earth."
GRU_union_congress:0 "Union Congress"
GRU_union_congress_desc:0 "Too much power in the hands of one man will lead only to another dictator.

#####bio####
POLITICS_PAUL_LENSCH_DESC:0 "Paul Lensch has been called many names during his atypical career, but no one has ever denied his determination and fanaticism.\n\nBorn in 1873, 10 years after the creation of the SPD, Paul joined the party as a young man and remained a faithful member, although he was already noticed by his colleagues for his strong nationalistic feeling and his sometimes atypical ideas. His work as an editor and journalist left him little time for himself, but Paul nevertheless found time to study several books at the Berlin State Library, where he had an epiphany. Reading the writings of Oswald Spengler, especially 'Preussentum und Sozialismus', and seeing the achievements of the great Bismarck and the soldier-king Frederick William I, he found in their social policy a better form of Socialism, a purer, stronger and above all more German form than that of the old Marx whom his comrades adored. He began to try to spread these ideas to his militant brothers, who rejected him and called him a reactionary revisionist, which led him to hide his atypical views. He was excluded from the SPD in 1916, when he announced his support for the Luddendorf dictatorship, even though his party was unanimously opposed to it. Lensch thus concentrated on the development of his ideology, combining Prussianism, traditional Volkism, Pan-Germanism, a corporatist economy and certain pseudo-socialist theses, he created his political party the GSVP, posing as the guardian of 'Germanic Socialism'. His movement remained very niche, but he and his supporters joined the other socialists when it was time to overthrow the old Kaiser.\n\nFew would have imagined that he would ever be in power, but now the 'Volkskanzler' is the new strongman of Germany, and he intends to fulfill his vision of a Great, Proud and truly Socialist Germany."

rotermorgen.70.d:0 "The occupation administration has called upon the first Congress of German Unions in which every union, party or political organization with more than 20.000 members is allowed to participate.\n\n The leading candidates are the SMEPD, which promotes a heavily Marxist influenced form of Syndicalism, and the SPD-R, the radicalized wing of the pre-war SPD, which calls for a "Socialist Democracy".\nBut there are other horses in the race as well. The FAUD, which has lost a lot of influence thanks to the legal formation of leftist parties in Germany, and the GSVP, which is lead by Paul Lensch and is not accepted by the other parties for its call for Pan-German nationalism and promotion of conservative values."

rotermorgen.1.a:0 "No thanks I am good."
rotermorgen.1.b:0 "That's the only reason I am here mate!"

rotermorgen.80.t:0 "SMEPD infighting escalates"
rotermorgen.80.d:0 "The SMEPD consisting of the SMEPD-S and SMEPD-M factions has finally split due to constant infighting among the Syndicalists and Marxists on important matters such as the state and future of the economy. The party leadership has called an emergency party convention on which both Thälmann and Pieck as well as several supporters of both did hold inspiring speeches constantly interrupted by insults from party members of the opposite faction.\n\nNow the question remains who came out on top."
rotermorgen.80.a:0 "Thälmann leads to prosperity!"
rotermorgen.80.b:0 "Pieck will guide us!"

rotermorgen.10.t:0 "The Occupation"
rotermorgen.10.d:0 "Now that we hold total control over Germany we must find a future way for it. The problem we now face is that while there have been underground organizations all over the German Empire, there has not been any official syndicalist or socialist one beside the FAUD, and we can't simply hand all power to a worker union that has strong factionalism inside.\nThe committee, consisting of the French, British and Italian delegations, has decided to call for the Germans to form unions parties for a future Congress of German Unions."
rotermorgen.10.a:0 "We shall see how this develops."

rotermorgen.20.t:0 "The Remains of the Old Parties"
rotermorgen.20.d:0 "While officially having banned all pre-war German parties at first, we have decided to legalize parties again that had shown commitment to the workers' struggle before the war.\n\nSeveral Syndicalist organizations and unions around prominent German Syndicalists like Ernst Thälmann are forming, but there is also the SPD which is having a great schism right now between those that oppose radical Socialist ideals the radical members that have now formed the SPD-R faction around Karl Liebknecht inside the SPD."
rotermorgen.20.a:0 "An interesting development."

rotermorgen.30.t:0 "The FAUD Split"
rotermorgen.30.d:0 "The FAUD has recently faced some major problems, when Ernst Thälmann left with a significant portion of its more Centralist members to form the SUDA „Syndikalistsche Union Deutscher Arbeiter“.\nFollowing this, the remains of the FAUD have made it clear that they will now represent the only truly Syndicalist union, as they call Thälmann a Marxist, Bolshevik, and traitor to liberty for his centralization stance on the government and economy."
rotermorgen.30.a:0 "Wait, weren't they our best horse in the race?"

rotermorgen.40.t:0 "Wilhelm Pieck Calls for Marxist-Leninism"
rotermorgen.40.d:0 "Wilhelm Pieck, one of Germany's best known supporters of Marxism-Leninism and enemy of lLiberal Syndicalism, has called for a return to the „true workers' struggle against class“ and Marxist thought.\nHe already announced that he will take part in the first elections with his newly formed Marxist party, the MLEPD."
rotermorgen.40.a:0 "Lenin failed in Russia, Pieck will fail here."

rotermorgen.50.t:0 "The Hypnotic Charm of Doctor Lensch"
rotermorgen.50.d:0 "While many already considered the formation of Pieck's MLEPD as problematic for a Syndicalist society, no one would have expected a party that could overshadow that.\n\nPaul Lensch, a former supporter of SPD and a revolutionary conservative Pan-German firebrand managed to organize a meeting of Nationalist hardliners in Pieck's MLEPD, Nationalists that had sympathies towards German unity and traditional economics, and the minority of „German Sorelians“."
rotermorgen.50.a:0 "Is this a joke?"

rotermorgen.51.t:0 "The Fusion of the SUDA and MLEPD"
rotermorgen.51.d:0 "Today, Ernst Thälmann and Wilhelm Pieck announced the fusion of SUDA and the MLEPD into the SMEPD due to their ideological similarities, and to increase their chance of grabbing power in Germany."
rotermorgen.51.a:0 "Syndicalist-Marxism?"

rotermorgen.52.t:0 "Paul Lensch and the GSVP"
rotermorgen.52.d:0 "Troubling news has reached our desks. That reactionary maniac Paul Lensch did actually manage to sway people to his cause and organized his own party, the GSVP, a „Germanic Socialist“ party as he calls it which is more or less a red-dressed version of conservative doctrines.\n\nHe even openly defies our power monopoly by forming his own militia called the „lobsters“ by many due to them using crimson uniforms."
rotermorgen.52.a:0 "Get me that troublemaker's head!"
rotermorgen.52.b:0 "Allow him to run in the elections if he holds his men on a leash."


rotermorgen.60.t:0 "Preparing the First Congress of German Unions"
rotermorgen.60.d:0 "We have prepared meeting spaces for representatives of all unions and parties of significant size to participate in the first Congress of German Unions."
rotermorgen.60.a:0 "We really did a great job here, didn't we?"

rotermorgen.61.t:0 "Crimsonshirts clash with Military Police"
rotermorgen.61.d:0 "37 dead! GSVP and Police clash!\n\nIt is on all the German newspapers the GSPV did not take kindly to our failed attempt to arrest its leader and the significant size of its militia and the fact that weapons from the war are all over the country make it impossible to end it this way without more bloodshed.\nThere is only one way left now, we must tolerate and allow the party for now in turn for turning in everyone that actively harmed or killed policemen."
rotermorgen.61.a:0 "Just get that damned congress done!"

rotermorgenmisc.5.t:0 "The Soul of Art"
rotermorgenmisc.5.d:0 "Among the artists at our most recent art convention, a rather well known artist by the name of Felix Nussbaum showcased his many pieces of art, chief among which being one that had most critics amazed. The piece, entitled 'The Soul', depicts a completely blank, white canvas, and while nearly all critics called it 'a Dadaist masterpiece' and said 'it's an example of what art should be about', some other critics called it 'bland', 'soulless', however, they were silenced by the crowd booing them out.\nAfterwards ,some of the artists in favor of Nussbaum even started to remove pieces created by those that were in critique of 'The Soul'."
rotermorgenmisc.5.a:0 "THIS is what true art is all about!"

rotermorgenmisc.800.t:0 "Germans pressure us to join the Internationale"
rotermorgenmisc.800.d:0 "Today we received a telegram from the German Syndicalist Republic offering us in accordance with France to join the 3rd Internationale.\nThis could be a great chance for us to gain the protection from the Syndicalist giants of Europe."
rotermorgenmisc.800.a:0 "Finally!"
rotermorgenmisc.800.b:0 "No thanks."

rotermorgenmisc.801.t:0 "Germans want us to join them"

rotermorgenmisc.801.a:0 "Finally!"
rotermorgenmisc.801.b:0 "No thanks."

rotermorgenmisc.802.t:0 "The [From.GetName] wish to join the Fourth Internationale"
rotermorgenmisc.802.d:0 "The young [From.GetName] has found itself under the command of the Bolshevik wing of their worker's congress, and now citing excessive doctrinal disagreement with the French led Third Internationale wish instead to join our cause. While they would certainly prove a great bulwark in our revolutionary struggle, this would likely put us at odds with the existing Syndicalist powers in the west, and so between ideological and realpolitik considerations, the question weighs heavy on the minds of our nation."
rotermorgenmisc.802.a:0 "A brotherhood with the German worker, forged in common struggle"
rotermorgenmisc.802.b:0 "Necessity demands we decline"

rotermorgenmisc.803.t:0 "The [From.GetName] rebuke us!"
rotermorgenmisc.803.d:0 "Despite our devotion to Lenin, and our similar desire for an independent internationale from the French revisionists, [From.GetNamedef] has rejected our membership in their alliance. While this has of course distraught much of the party, we have made no lack of effort to redouble our crusade against the rising tide of false socialism, let the fact we stand alone be proof that we alone must lead the revolution!."
rotermorgenmisc.803.a:0 "We stand alone, against all revisionists!"

rotermorgenmisc.810.t:0 "Victory over Karl Marx"
rotermorgenmisc.810.d:0 "After our proclamation of victory over the Spectre of Marx any and all works created by Germany's greatest traitor were burned. By official decree, even mentioning the name of Marx in any positive light shall be seen as a crime punishable by 10 years of hard labour."
rotermorgenmisc.810.a:0 "As it should be."

rotermorgenGCW.5.t:0 "Open Rebellion"
rotermorgenGCW.5.d:0 "It happened...\nThe unthinkable has happened, we are facing an open rebellion stirred up by all sorts of Leftists and left aligned nationalists from the Rhine, several "Germanic Socialists", "National-Bolsheviks" from the north, Socialists and Bolsheviks and from all of the western German lands, unemployed Germans that sought help with the FAUD, and other Syndicalist Unions.\n\nNow these unlikely allies have all formed a united front and central command, already having swayed half our worker class based soldiers and sailors to their cause. We face the biggest war on German soil since the Napoleonic age and as if it wasn't enough the vile Commune of France has seized the opportunity to seize Alsace-Lorraine."
rotermorgenGCW.5.a:0 "Für Gott und Vaterland!"

rotermorgenGCW.10.t:0 "Victory Proclaimed"
rotermorgenGCW.10.d:0 "The Revolutionary Central Command has proclaimed total Victory over the Imperial Forces and called for a quick restoration of order in Germany; having already signed a treaty with France to give up all claims on Alsace-Lorraine in exchange for membership in the Internationale.\n\nMeanwhileld rivalries and ideological incompatibilities are boiling up again but also newly forged alliances have emerged inside the revolution.\nThe ideological leaders of the revolution have already started to organize their own new political parties for the upcoming First German Congress."

rotermorgenGCW.30.t:0 "Champions of the Masses"
rotermorgenGCW.30.d:0 "The FAUD, the biggest worker union in Germany and often marginalized by the imperial government for being the undisputed champion of the worker class, has called for a reorganization as a political party, which has caused several internal problems because of the political rivalries of high ranking members."
rotermorgenGCW.30.a:0 "Still one of the biggest."

rotermorgenGCW.40.t:0 "Syndicalistischer Marxismus"
rotermorgenGCW.40.d:0 "The leaders of the Authoritarian Syndicalists, Ernst Thalmann, and the Bolsheviks, Wilhelm Pleck, have agreed that their ideological beliefs have enough in common to found a unified front against the Liberals and the Nationalists inside the revolution. They have called for all their followers to enlist in their newly founded Syndicalist-Marxist party the SMEPD.\n\nIf that will be enough to challenge the big ones remains questionable."
rotermorgenGCW.40.a:0 "We shall see."

rotermorgenGCW.50.t:0 "The Black Sheep"
rotermorgenGCW.50.d:0 "Most inside the Revolution consider nationalism beyond patriotism to be a sickness.\n\n Only Most though; not all of them no, there is one man who managed to unify most of the nationalistic groups during the civil war already behind his banner.\nThat man is Paul Lensch. Having developed his own ideology called 'Germanic Socialism' which is very far from what most would call 'Socialist' instead calling for a partially nationalized social corporate economy to end class struggle by national cooperation. But he is also a man that could only be compared to the ghost of Bismarck, due to his pan-German and conservative yet somewhat revolutionary outlook.\n\nHe has announced today that he will take part in the congress with his new party the GSVP."
rotermorgenGCW.50.a:0 "Just give his delegation the worst seats...OK?"

Yet, the German Empire does nothing to alleviate their suffering. Too concerned with its own imperial confusion to help the average German. Black Monday for many Germans has finally pulled their heads out of the clouds, as they finally see that the Empire cares little for them or their families. Such resentment has done the unthinkable, as people who once detested the reds now are joining one of their many groups.

This astonishing turn of events shows the threat in which the Socialists pose to the German order.

Currently, there are only two channels on the Weitseher, one for news and one for entertainment which mostly consists of live music performances in various UFA studios.

What he did know was that the high crimes of treason along with various claims of crimes against humanity during the civil war were enough for the judges to reach a conclusion within no more than two hours of each trial. Each time, almost unanimously, the sentence was always guilty with a punishment of death.

Whatever the case may be, unionist councils are running a coordinated effort to overhaul education in all areas, from the curriculum to the facilities. Although the exact specifics of the Anarcho-Syndicalist curriculum may differ based on the area of Germany, there is a general agreement that children will be educated on the ideas of their society. The main tenants include emphasis on equity and cooperation among all peers, the encouragement of progressive ideals and experimentation, teaching students the inherent wrongs of the reactionary, capitalistic, and imperialistic Germany’s of yore, and the inner workings of the Anarcho-Syndicalist system and the ideals that power it. Some families claim that the new curriculum is purely ideological and doesn’t prepare the next generation for actual work. In some towns, there are notable absences of subjects such as calculus and physics while subjects revolving around socialist political theory and the arts get more precedence in schooling. FAUD has addressed these concerns by emphasizing how the Anarcho-Syndicalist future must be secured within education first before reactionaries poison the next generation."

FAUD has viewed the treatment of gays and lesbians in this manner as incredibly barbaric and backward, which is why it came as little surprise to any when they decriminalized homosexuality and enacted legal protections towards them. Under the new laws, homosexuals will be granted equal opportunities in all levels of government, employment, and military service with any institutional discrimination towards or hate crimes towards them being met with legal punishment. The most controversial aspect of these new laws is the protections of the very small transsexual community in Germany, which even some members of FAUD think is going a bit too far as it might bolden the already inflamed reactionary resistance to these new laws.

FAUD understands this principle fully, which is why they have decided unanimously during a joint session of their trade unions to formally declare the red militias as the military vanguard of the Revolution. This declaration firmly places the militias as the main military force of Germany and to be the institution most trusted with maintaining and upholding the revolution behind the unions and councils themselves.

Not even mentioning those of the colonies who had come to the mainland for the purpose of work, whether they be black, South East Asian, or Chinese. To keep these minority groups down any longer would be a disgrace to German history and its people, which is why during a recent session of FAUD unions it was agreed that more action should be taken to ensure that these groups are treated equally. Aside from the anti-discrimination laws against them, unions and communes have instituted employment quotas for minority groups every year to ensure that they get better chances of employment. Failure to hit the quotas might result in potential fines and punishments towards the unions and communes that do so. This is perhaps the most controversial action taken by FAUD so far, as it was the first FAUD vote to receive a decent amount of union opposition to.

Named the Geheime Staatspolizei, or Gestapo for short, this new centralized police agency will answer only directly to the will of the People’s Parliament and has carte blanche to run operations as they see fit for the sake of Germany and the Revolution. The parliament voted for militia leader and longtime loyalist Ernst Wollweber to be the Gestapo’s first head. Since the creation of the Gestapo, there have already been various confirmed disappearances of some German citizens and some of the more vocal members of the opposition have gone strangely silent if they weren’t a part of the disappeared already. Many were quick to catch onto the Gestapo’s existence, and as a result the fear and paranoia generated by them has been enough to keep the more reactionary Germans in line, if not become fiercely loyal to the Revolution."

The methods tend to differ based on who carries it out; the Gestapo prefers a method called “Sardine Packing where reactionaries lay down in a deep ditch only to be shot while the next row lays on top of their corpses to repeat the process, while some of the red militias prefer using mounted machine guns to mow down lined up crowds before piling up their corpses to be doused with gasoline and set on fire. There are even rumors going around that one militia, Rotkämpferbund Radek, has preformed various cruel acts on those meant to be executed, with some claims saying that some are hunted like animals or dragged by vehicles, not even mentioning the stories of rape and use of reactionaries as targets for shooting practice.

Despite whatever challenges they may have put up, Pieck’s faction has been weakened to a point where they can be removed from the picture as a whole. Which is why the People’s Parliament issued arrest warrants for Pieck and the upper echelons of his clique so that they could be brought to public trial. International observers remarked that the trials were conducted with an usual degree of fairness, as the defendants were given proper lawyers to defend them along with time to make their case. However, it did not change the fact that the presiding jury had been entirely composed of SMEPD bureaucrats or low ranking militia members, or the fact that some of the evidence and witness testimonies were either partially or fully fabricated to match some of the charges against them. In the end, Pieck along with his inner circle and lieutenants were found guilty of a variety of charges, with all of them having their party membership, along with any awards and titles, revoked and being prohibited from holding a position of power or political office again. The courts even went as far as place Pieck and some others on indefinite house arrest.

They keep people healthy and functional, ensuring that we remain nice and well for the purpose of serving the people and the revolution. The only issue is that the majority of doctors are bourgeois, living in luxury and many of them coming from privileged backgrounds, and as a result they struggle to empathize with the common man and the revolution. This cannot continue if we wish for the revolution to advance. Which is why the People’s Chamber has announced the Revolutionary Doctors initiative under the Cultural Revolution. This new program will have specially selected factory workers and peasants be sent to education facilities to be taught the marvels of modern medicine and to raise them to become the new German doctors. As for the former bourgeois doctors, a select few have been chosen to teach the members in the program in exchange for political and societal rehabilitation, while the rest will be sent to either re-education camps or work camps. While some may hold doubts about the quality of these new doctors, with some reports claiming that they gave wrong dosages of medicine to their patients or even dropped surgical tools in their patients during operations, many are optimistic that with more time these doctors will be on par or even better than the old bourgeois ones."

rotermorgenmisc.39.t:0 "The New German Cinema"
rotermorgenmisc.39.d:0 "After the revolution that freed Germany from the Kaiser, the German film industry wasn’t in the best position. Whereas German cinema was largely considered to be on par with Hollywood with both blockbuster and Avant Guard productions, the violent conflict in Germany ground any production to a complete halt. Studios were destroyed, talent either died or fled, and an important medium of German entertainment and culture suffered because of it. However, the GSVP hopes to change all that through the nationalization and consolidation of UFA. This new nationalization will see UFA gain massive state funding to rebuild the German film industry, while consolidating any remaining non-independent German studios into the company. With its headquarters stationed in Babelsberg outside of Berlin, what the GSVP hopes to achieve through this is to reforge the wrecked film industry back to the scale of Hollywood, while projecting the new German arts and values on an international level. Even now, UFA has multiple projects in the works which can expect to see releases starting next year. On top of this, UFA is securing agreements with friendly nations to screen their films once released, aspiring actors and actresses come from all over are being encouraged to come to Germany to try to land a part in a production, and directors and state producers constantly negotiate with nations of the world so secure exotic filming locations."

rotermorgenmisc.860.d:0 "The elites of Germany either political or industrial and people of influence had all arrived at the Krupp estate for a great banquet and party, the wives of industrial were flirting with actors the old and rich Men gazed at the waitresses and lots of champagne were spilled.\nBut not by Krupp himself and his little clique of the top industrials which had retreated quietly after the party started into his meeting room where they were about to discuss a plan they had developed for months to finally take grasp of Germany once and for all and to get rid of all remains of the social state the SPD once had imposed on them. The full plan would include the formation of the Wirtschaftskommission der Industriellen or W.D.I., a committee of the most influential industrials... or rather those in the room at this moment. It would also include the formal dissolution of the DLP and also the dissolution of the Reichstag installing the W.D.I. as an emergency legislative body and defacto setting up a dictatorship by group and his gang.\nBut not all at the meeting were confident about it yet and called for less drastic measurements to ensure their through the DLP."

rotermorgenmisc.1000.t:0 "An Impossible Referendum?" 
rotermorgenmisc.1000.d:0 "As our Christian Democratic Union under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer continues its reforms, creating a more moral and socially just Germany, the Republic born out of tumult and strife is being brought closer to the Catholic ideal, yet still respectful of minorities and the Protestant majority. With the relative stability of recent months, our government started to quickly attract many old German conservatives. Among them are former members of the DkP, the German Conservative Party which ruled during our nation's downfall into the fires of revolution and civil war.\n\nWhile the previous iteration of our party, that being Zentrum, was tacitly allied with the DkP and Papen's chancellorship our platforms diverged vastly when Germany was broken. This has led to the establishment of a semi-official 'monarchist' wing, a phenomenon previously unheard of on a larger scale within our party, now accelerated by the influx of DkP supporters, our government partners within the Christian Social Union in Bavaria and more authoritarian members of Zentrum such as Ludwig Kaas. Despite Adenauer being far from a monarchist, seeing as his political ideology was shaped by the erosion of the Rhenish identity by the Hohenzollernian 'Prussianism' and Bismarckian Kulturkampf targeting the Church, he could possibly be convinced by his fellow Rhenish patriot Kaas to begrudgingly support a democratic referendum on the restoration of the monarchy.\n\nObviously, such a choice would need to be properly explained to our citizens as to make sure they can make an informed decision. The early draft of such a proposal considers scheduling two separate referendums, the first deciding if the German people want a return to a monarchy, but under a more just persona with a truly constitutional system, and the second to decide who shall be the new Kaiser.\n\nDespite most members of CDU not being happy with such ideas floating around, they also could be convinced to follow the will of the people if the candidates to the throne would exclude most if not all Protestant nobles, especially from the House Hohenzollern with very individual exceptions. The decision now lies before the Kanzler, and no matter what he chooses it will signal a dramatic shift for the German nation."

rotermorgenmisc.1001.t:0 "A Head for the Restored Crown"
rotermorgenmisc.10011.t:0 "A Head for the Restored Crown Continued"
rotermorgenmisc.1001.d:0 "Much to the amazement of everyone, even the people that proposed the referendum in the first place, the German populace has decided, by a thin margin of 53%, to officially restore the monarchy under a new constitutional system. Even though the voter turnout was smaller than anticipated, millions of Germans have made their voice clear and many millions more will now be galvanized to take part in the second referendum to determine their actual head of state. According to the list drafted by the Reichstag there are six possible choices, almost all of them of course being Catholic nobles.\n\nThe most obvious one is Georg II, King of Saxony. When the Revolution broke out, George to the surprise and chagrin of many, renounced his title and escaped to Austrian Innsbruck, joining the community of Jesuits running the Collegium Canisianum. Many of his close associates have long whispered about Georg wanting to become a priest, something which the Revolution almost made a reality, yet with the ascension of the moderate strain of socialism in Germany and then the CDU Georg was allowed to return to Saxony. He mostly led a very quiet life in recent months despite once again becoming the King of Saxony in response to the overwhelming demands of his former subjects. He spends his days organizing charity for the people left destitute by the war and engaging in thoughtful prayers alongside local monks. With his education in political sciences and economics, deep devotion to the Catholic Church and also respect towards Protestants and Jews, owing to the ecumenical nature he developed whilr interacting with overwhelmingly Lutheran tutors in his youth, Georg would serve as the best candidate to unite all spheres of Germany under the banner of the CDU. If he was to be elected, he's expected to take the name of Georg I.\n\nAnother choice, lobbied for by Bavarian CSU, would be the House of Wittelsbach represented by King Rupprecht and Prince Albrecht. Rupprecht is by far the most experienced monarch of all the possible candidates and also deeply Catholic, yet many within our party worry that his tolerance of Austro-Populist elements in Bavaria and his Weltkrieg era idea of creating an internal Triumvirate inside Germany between Prussia, Bavaria and integrated Netherlands would signal a definite end to other identities such as Rheinish or would simply turn Germany from formerly Prussian dominated state into a Bavarian one, with CDU being substituted by CSU.\nThe people, if they still would wish to choose a Wittelsbach, could elect his son Albrecht. Despite being next in line to inherit the Prince is mostly a recluse, more fascinated with his field of study in forestry, deer hunting and introducing exotic breeds of dogs. He could serve as a very sybolic ruler and also garner the sympathy of the more environmentally concious citizens. If elected they would take the names Rupprecht I and Albrecht III respectively."
rotermorgenmisc.10011.d:0 "The next two possible candidates, hailing from the Catholic branch of the House Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, twin brothers Friedrich and Franz Joseph are seen as a rather peculiar choice by much of Germany's population. Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern, speculated by some to be a future King of Spain if Germany was to ever interveene in the nation, thanks to the claim given through the blood of his mother Princess Maria Theresa of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, had led a rather standard noble life, although with his love of all things war he slowly started to gravitate to radical volkisch militias that began to spring up in the aftermath of multiple syndicalist revolutions in recent decades. After the Revolution started, many of Friedrich's friends assumed he'd just die in battle against the socialists, but he proved everyone wrong, even the moderate SPD-R government itself. The Prince waged a truly revolutionary war of his own, a legalistic one in the new Republican courts to retain the ownership of vast forests in East Prussia, and to the surprise of many a law scholar, he won. In the aftermath turning his hard-won estate into a true exclusion zone for any sort of reds or traitors to Germany, only recently relaxing with the ascension of the CDU. Prince Friedrich would be crowned as Friedrich IV, merging the historical legacy of both Habsburg Friedrich III of Holy Roman Empire and the German Kaiser Friedrich III who was taken away early and succeed by the failure that was Wilhelm II.\n\nHis brother, Franz Joseph of Hohenzollern, or how he likes to title himself Hohenzollern-Emden is no less strange if perhaps even more. Serving during the Weltkrieg as a torpedo officer on the light cruiser SMS Emden, Franz Joseph came to view himself as a righteous knight sailing to protect Germany against all whom may threaten her. He immortalized that outlook in a book about his wartime experience titled 'Emden: The Last Cruise of the Chivalrous Raider', and after coming into contact with exiled political radicals while serving in German East Asia adopting the title of Prince of Hohenzollern-Emden, much to the annoyance of the rest of his family. What is even more bizarre to average Germans are recent reports that he supposedly came under the influence of the so-called 'Coconut Monk' of Vietnam, ruling from his 'Phoenix Island'. If the Prince of Emden was to be chosen, he'd crown himself as Franz Joseph II, in clear mockery of what he sees as the liberal and weak Habsburgs not worthy of the legacy of the first Franz Joseph.\n\nThe last candidate, many would say both the most unassuming and the most divisive considering our party origin, is the once almost King of Finland Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia. Despite being both a Protestant and a Hohenzollern, which is why he's the favoured candidate among former DkP members, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm was rejected as the candidate to that throne because of his Catholic wife, a fact many of his CDU supporters came to utilize during the campaign. After that he studied philosophy and even received a doctorate from the University of Bonn, turning his attention to devising how to implement British-like parliamentarian monarchy in Germany to avoid what he saw as the main cause of the Empire's weakness. After the Revolution Friedrich Wilhelm became a true vanguard within the monarchist movement, fighting day and night to legally restore the Empire in a reformed fashion, a goal he shares with the monarchist wing of our party and which has now came to fruition. If elected, he'd be crowned as Friedrich Wilhelm V."

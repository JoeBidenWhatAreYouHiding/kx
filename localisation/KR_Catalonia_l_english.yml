### New Catalan Events ###
CAT.1.t:0 "The Catalan Rebellion"
CAT.1.d:0 "The streets of Barcelona roared with action, as anarchist militias, nationalist Escamot paramilitaries and Catalan independence army forces from the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya clashed with the few remaining troops from Guardia Civil. Many within the ranks of that militarized police formation had already deserted and headed for the Spanish border, or if they had any Catalan roots or republican sympathies, jumped ship to the side of the rebels. Lluis Companys, the successor of the venerable Catalan freedom fighter Francesc Macia, had assumed command of independent Catalonia, aligning with a wide coalition ranging from the Marxists of PCP and the anarchists of CNT-FAI all the way to the ultranationalists of Nosaltres Sols and Estat Catala. Their combined forces had quickly encircled the few bastions of Spanish resistance in the city, and in the rural areas, peasant militias, Carlist requetes and anarchist squadrons hunted the Spanish loyalists.\n\n While the Spanish response would inevitably arrive soon, the new state had managed to consolidate its position to a far greater degree than ever before. On the balcony of Catalan parliament, Lluis Companys proclaimed the formation of an independent Catalan republic, free from the oppression of Spain once more. He stated that Catalonia would fight to the last man alongside their Basque and Galician allies, until all peoples of Spain would be free from the grip of Castile, and urged the separatists of Asturias and Andalusia to take up arms and fight for their freedom just as Catalans had done. These speeches could hardly reach neither of those regions, but the ideals resonated in the citizens of Valencia and Balearics nonetheless, and many within these regions took up arms to fight against the absolutist rule of the Bourbons with unprecedented ferocity. Catalonia breathed free, and in its rebellion’s wake, the other regions of Spain were stirred from their slumber."
CAT.1.a:0 "Visca Catalunya!"

CAT.2.t:0 "Dawn of the Exercit Popular"
CAT.2.d:0 "Tense minutes passed outside the headquarters of Barcelona’s IV Organic Division, as the Catalan Mossos d'Esquadra police forces had encircled the building and demanded that general Domenec Batet, highest ranking military officer in Catalonia, surrender himself to the authorities at the request of President Companys. The troops occupying the building had formed an improvised defensive line on the windows, but so far no actual combat had taken place. The leader of the Mossos’ force was growing anxious, as while his men had the advantage in numbers, they lacked the experience to contest such a good defensive position. The door of the building swung open, and Batet walked out in uniform but unarmed, seemingly not resisting the arrest. The general, upon hearing the Mossos leader’s demands, countered the proposal by stating that the men under Batet’s command would not resist the rebellion, but would in fact support it.\n\n Batet, known to foster a degree of republican and Catalanist sympathies, had decided to cut ties with the Spanish monarchy after their latest betrayal. Soon, in a meeting between the president and the general, the final details of this alliance were ironed out, and Batet, now considered a loyalist to the Catalan cause, was placed at the head of the newly formed Exercit Popular de Catalunya. The general would have quite a bit of work ahead of him, as the various paramilitaries and militias of Catalonia would not look favourably to a state military, but for the time being, they would have to cope with the military’s presence if they did not wish to taste oblivion from the Spanish invaders’ weapons."
CAT.2.a:0 "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."

CAT.3.t:0 "Forging Swords out of Plowshares"
CAT.3.d:0 "With the breakout of our rebellion, the industrial might of Catalonia has been quite helpful for dismantling the Spanish opposition, but nonetheless it is clear that Catalonia’s current military production is insufficient. Especially dire is the need for ammunition and proper infantry weapons, as much of Spain’s military weapon production came from the arsenals of Oviedo in Asturias, especially from the Mauser plants there. Obviously access to those is now lost, but things are not as dire as may seem. Catalonia has always had some degree of weapon production, and lately skilled craftsmen even from other trades have taken up the challenge. Small workshops pump out pistols, submachine guns, shotguns and rifles, though the quality, calibres and overall standardization is quite poor at times. If Catalonia is to supply its armies and militias with proper weapons capable of holding back the Spanish menace, the government must take drastic action and nationalize some factories for the production of weapons, cartridges and artillery munitions. For this purpose, Josep Tarradellas, newly appointed minister of industry in the provisional cabinet, has been promoted to be the leader of the Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra. The provisional government has the commission  a very generous slice of the spending budget to oversee the conversion of various civilian factories towards military uses. Priority will be given to factories that utilize chemicals in their production already, such as the Pirelli tire factory in Barcelona, as these plants will have previous expertise with handling hazardous materials needed for ammunition production. Tarradellas hopes that once the project is up and running, Catalan production may quickly catch up to that of Spain. The shortage of weapons, artillery and armoured vehicles must be addressed in the future of course, but without ammunition, these weapons of war will be absolutely useless."
CAT.3.a:0 "Let us hope the factories can get running soon."

CAT.4.t:0 "Rekindling the Nationalist Partnership"
CAT.4.d:0 "So far, the provisional government has mostly been made out of moderates or allies of ERC, such as the Acció Catalana Republicana and Unió Democràtica de Catalunya, but a more broad coalition is needed if the Catalan government wants at least a marginal grip on the various political militias roaming the streets of Barcelona and elsewhere. Anarchists, Marxist nationalists, Escamot radicals and members of the  l'Organització Militar Nosaltres Sols!, the para-military arm of the newly established Nosaltres Sols party. Their leader, Daniel Cardona i Civit, is a long-time veteran of Catalan nationalism, and used to be part of Estat Catala, same as ERC, until a disagreement led him to split from the wider movement to create his own. While not a massive party, their stalwart commitment to Catalan nationalism has already made them a favourite of the people in many ways, especially after Cardona i Civit denounced the anti-parliamentary rhetoric that some of the party’s members peddled. The nationalists have already approached the government on the grounds of possible cooperation, so aligning them would not be a difficult feat. While their militias, OMNS, are not particularly strong, they could provide an alternative to the quite unreliable and brutal Escamots, who are known to be largely controlled by the radicals Josep Dencas and Miquel Badia. It will however give Nosaltres Sols a good degree of coverage in the media, so once the elections are held, they’re likely to be far stronger in terms of support, but that is definitely a problem for another time. If the Spaniards are not repulsed, then Catalan elections will never come into fruition."
CAT.4.a:0 "A toast to new allies."

CAT.5.t:0 "Courting the Left-Wing Support"
CAT.5.d:0 "In the early hours, even before the sun had graced Catalonia with its rays, a surprising entourage of anarchists from CNT-FAI arrived to the steps of Palau del Parlament. They were let in by a guard, and escorted to a room where the Catalan provisional government had gathered, some still drowsy from the early awakening. The anarchists, led by Joan Garcia i Oliver, were greeted by president Lluis Companys, minister of industry Josep Tarradellas, newly appointed war minister Daniel Cardona i Civit and minister of education Luis Nicolau d'Olwer. To their surprise, the anarchists also met eyes with the members of Partit Catala Proletari, the nationalist Marxist group of Catalonia, led by Jaime Compte. Joan Garcia questioned the inclusion of PCP in a meeting that had been clearly organized between CNT-FAI and the government, but Companys explained that he had invited PCP in to these negotiations on the grounds that they would also be able to get a seat in the government. While still disgruntled by the inclusion of their rivals in the meeting, the anarchists allowed it to continue uninterrupted, and negotiations of a possible inclusion of CNT-FAI and PCP representatives in the government could begin.\n\n The CNT-FAI, much to the surprise of Companys and rest of the government, had taken a rather reconciliatory approach, and when Joan Garcia was offered the seat of Minister of Justice, mainly to keep the anarchists from organizing their own courts, he approved the offer. Anarchists militias and especially the notorious Nosotros group, would help the Catalan army in the upcoming struggle for survival, although both the government and the anarchists seemed inclined to avoid the discussion of whether cooperation would continue once the crisis was over. A confrontation after the war seemed almost inevitable, even with Companys’ pro-labour policies, yet both sides clearly considered the threat of the Bourbons too dangerous to allow ideological differences to ruin the chance of a coalition.\n\n The PCP on the other hand demanded the immediate withdrawal of ERC interest in CADCI, a trade union where PCP and ERC had butted heads over the dominance of these parties. The members of ERC saw this demand as completely unreasonable, especially given how crucial control of the union was for their popular support, and after yet more unsuccessful negotiations, Compte and his supporters stormed off the meeting. While this failure would make it harder for ERC to mobilize the left-wing support needed to hold back the Spaniards, it did mean that they also did not have to consolidate power to other actors besides CNT-FAI. With the conclusion of the meeting, the anarchists swore to follow the dictates of Generalitat de Catalunya, at least for the duration of the war."
CAT.5.a:0 "Remarkable progress."

CAT.6.t:0 "Mossos d’Esquadra"
CAT.6.d:0 "Mossos d’Esquadra are probably the oldest form of Catalan military organization, tracing their lineage back to the Escuadras de Paisanos of the 1710s, an unit created to oppose the Miquelets, supporters of Archduke Charles of the Habsburg family, by the Spanish Bourbons. Ironically enough, now this creation of the crown-headed vipers shall reap havoc amongst their lackeys, as currently the Mossos are only real unit capable of being converted to military use in Catalonia, excluding the various militias of course. While not equipped or trained for this task in the slightest, and hampered by years of mistreatment by the Spanish authorities, especially after the Mossos sided with Catalans after the creation of the Republic. For years, they served as lapdogs of the Spanish monarchy, only to find their way towards the independence movement, and now, they shall defend Catalonia from their creators.\n\n Massive programs have been initiated by the War Ministry to get the Mossos in a shape where they can hold the line until better armed and trained forces make it out of boot camps, but the lack of equipment is especially dire. They are mostly armed with pistols, revolvers and the occasional Tigre carbine or Astra machine pistol, making it rather difficult for them to battle actual military formations with armoured support and artillery contingents. Still, it is hoped that the rather urban nature of the upcoming fighting could help them even the odds against the Spaniards, though only time will tell if this is the case. Nonetheless, these brave men must hold the line, if Catalonia is to survive."
CAT.6.a:0 "True heroes."

CAT.7.t:0 "Vibrant’s Band"
CAT.7.d:0 "With the Spanish invasion imminent, the Catalan nation prepared itself for the trials of tomorrow, but despite the external threat, tensions ran high even inside the small country. The Catalan independence movement had, for decades, centered heavily around the personality of Francesc Macia, one of the founders of Estat Catala and later, the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya. While Lluis Companys, his successor after Macia passed away from illness in 1933, was certainly a popular politician, he had not been able to mend the rifts left in the movement by Macia during his last years. During the Republican years, the nationalist leader had abandoned his separatist ideals for a compromise with the Spanish republicans, and this had caused many to reconsider their stance towards ERC. Chief among these dissidents was Daniel Cardona i Civit, a long-time supporter of Estat Catala who broke away from the party in 1920s to found the Holy Brotherhood of the Black Flag, a terrorist organization seeking total independence from Spain. While he would leave that organization as well, it would be continued spiritually in the Nosaltres Sols group, inspired by the Irish Sinn Fein down to its name. Cardona, known by the nicknames Vibrant and the Irishman, due to his admiration of the Emerald Isle, is known as the most uncompromising nationalist in Catalonia, not accepting any notion of union with Spain. While his organization, Nosaltres Sols, is very radical and nationalist, they aren’t inherently opposed to democracy, and Cardona has vehemently denounced ideologies like Legionarism and Totalism as oppression of the liberty, no better than imperialist overlords. While the provisional government and Cardona have some differences in ideology, they probably need not worry about getting support from the Vibrant’s men."
CAT.7.a:0 "Curious grouping."

CAT.8.t:0 "Support from France"
CAT.8.d:0 "While majority of Catalonia is now under the rule of the Barcelona government, there are still areas beyond our grasp where Catalans live under foreign rule. The Balearics, split between supporters of our rule in the isle of Menorca and supporters of the Spanish in Majorca, still lie outside of our grasp. In Sardinia, a group of Catalans live in a coastal town of Algheri. But perhaps the most important region is the French province of Roussillon, where a large majority of Catalans has existed since the French encroached on our territory centuries ago. The territory houses many Catalan, though nationalism towards our people is nowhere near as strong as here in Catalonia. Nonetheless, there are those in Roussillon who still feel the homeland’s call, and many have crossed the border to help. The French Communards, always ready to exploit weakness in their reactionary enemies, have turned a blind eye to these nationalist groups. While not massive in size, these groups have provided much needed manpower to the army and militias. Some of them hope that one day, Roussillon can join its brothers and sisters in a state union, but to many, the simple notion of true Catalan independence is a prize in itself."
CAT.8.a:0 "Patriots, all the same."

CAT.9.t:0 "Victory in the Balearics"
CAT.9.d:0 "The Spanish garrison in the island of Majorca had remained at maximum alert level after the proclamation of Catalan state, but as they set out to suppress yet another riot, the garrison commander could only sigh. The Catalans of the island, while less fervent about the independence as their mainland compatriots, were still very angry about the king’s proclamation. The Madrid government had promised help in the suppression of the riots, and the rebellious island of Menorca taken over by the Catalan militias, but little actual support had arrived. Now, however, the situation seemed a little brighter. The gunboat Gada, flying the colours of Spanish crown, had just arrived to the port of Palma, and the garrison commander arrived to greet it personally with a small squad of soldiers. Saluting the arrivals, a platoon of marines, the garrison was met with silence, and as the weapons of the marines were leveled at them, the loyalists had mere seconds to react. Most did not, and as the staccato of machine guns rang around the port, the garrison command was slain before even a minute had passed. The platoon, made up of the most hardened Escamot commandos, soon swept the military barracks clean of remaining monarchists, and while many Spaniards managed to escape into the island’s wilderness, the Catalans had liberated the island through this one critical strike. With Majorca under their rule, the other isles soon folded into compliance."
CAT.9.a:0 "The last piece of Catalonia under Spain is free at last."

CAT.10.t:0 "The Armoured Gauntlet of Exercit Popular"
CAT.10.d:0 "The fight against Spaniards will require modern arms and ammunition, but Catalonia has precious few of those to go around. Of especially short supply are vehicles that can be used in combat, as only a few German-made light tanks and armoured cars were scattered around Barcelona when the revolt began, and usually, these vehicles were made more than a decade ago. However, taking note from the Asturian uprising of 1934, the Catalan anarchists have come up with the tiznao concept, a very crude conversion of civilian truck or car with armour plates, usually taken from scrapyards or factory lines, bolted onto it. Most of these vehicles can barely withstand rifle fire, and even fewer are armed properly, but they do provide some degree of mechanized support for our troops. As the anarchists are, understandably, hesitant in ceding these vehicles to the army, the Catalan CIG factories have been dedicated to the task of creating tiznaos for the independence war ahead. Probably the most popular armed model is the Constructora Field variant, where large, rounded armour scheme made out of boiler plate is placed on top of a truck, and a small turret armed with a machine gun is housed at the back of the vehicle. While crude and rudimentary, their distinct shape and large bulk have made them popular among the common people, and their construction has been largely encouraged by generous funds from the military leadership."
CAT.10.a:0 "They might not be Krupp’s latest Panzers but they will suffice."


CAT.20.t:0 "The [GetYear] Catalan Elections"
CAT.20.d:0 "For the first time in history, free Catalan Republic stands alone, liberated from Castilian scum by the sacrifices of its noble people. But as the new state consolidates itself on the Mediterranean coast, the citizens of free Catalonia had pressured interim president Lluis Companys to hold elections so that the Catalan people can begin building our democracy, and eventually with no further attacks from Spain coming, Companys agreed. The elections are bound to be heavily contested, as seven parties have campaigned heavily for the people’s mandate.\n\nRepresenting the provisional government’s main party, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya is a social democratic party with great political capital in Catalonia through the influence of its leader, Lluis Companys, though many consider him too sympathetic to the syndicalists. Promoting a more moderate centre-left ideology, Acció Catalana Republicana, led by Luis Nicolau d'Olwer, seeks to create a progressive, liberal republic in Catalonia. A former member of ACR, Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera, has announced that his party, Unió Democràtica de Catalunya, will also be running in the elections, on a similar platform to ACR but with a very noticeable Christian democrat stint, mixing Catholic values with compatible liberal ideas.\n\nOn the right-side of the Catalan democratic parties stand three notably different parties, with the conservative and markedly more pro-Spanish Liga Catalana, the monarcho-socialist Partido Socialista Monárquico running as the black horse candidate and the big-tent nationalist party of Daniel Cardona i Civit, Nosoltros Sols, known for their famous assanssination attempt against Alfonso XIII. Liga Regionalista has managed to claw back from irrelevancy thanks to their newfound support among the Spaniards of Catalonia, while the previously unknown party PSM has found supporters among derelict Carlists, Alfonsists and unionists of the new country. The radical nationalist rhetoric of Nosoltros Sols meanwhile has captured the hearts and minds of many young Catalans, and may just buy them the victory. However, as the polling stations close, the winner becomes clear, and it is.."

CAT.21.t:0 "The Catalonian Socialist Elections"
CAT.21.d:0 "As the red and black flags flutter over the roofs of Catalonia, the new socialist order has slowly solidified its position among the populace of the young nation. Many feared that the Partit Català Proletari would not give in to the demands of its temporary allies, and that they would form a vanguard party similar to the original Bolsheviks of Russia. These fears, to the surprise and relief of many within Catalonia, have turned out to be false. Jaume Compte i Canelles, leader of PCP, has announced an election to be held between the members of the socialist alliance, with the recipient of the most votes becoming the young nation’s new helmsman for the span of four years.\n\n The PCP runs on a platform of nationalist Marxism, seeking to implement centralist, highly radical reforms that would seek the emergence of planned economy nation-wide, led from the top of the party leadership downwards to the grassroots worker’s movements. PCP is also the most Catalanist of the parties and puts its fiery nationalist rhetoric first to appeal to the many nationalists of Catalonia who would otherwise steer clear of socialist parties. The combat squads of CNT-FAI remnants, Nosotros, led by the venerable Catalan anarchist Juan Garcia i Oliver, were first to announce their participation, seeking to create a federal anarcho-syndicalist territory within Catalonia, one ruled by action, violence against the forces of counter-revolution and fervent reorganization of the territory towards communal aims and ownership.\n\n Unió Socialista de Catalunya, the local broad coalition of communists, socialists and non-anarchist syndicalists, have also stated that they will run in the elections. Their party platform is in many ways similar to PCP, but their leader, Joan Comorera i Soler, is especially focused on the issues of security and stability of the socialist state, claiming that his main goals are combating the chaos and lawlessness brought upon Catalonia after the revolution. Finally, the remaining survivors of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, rallying under the beaten and battered Lluis Companys i Jover, have declared to run on a platform of moderate syndicalization of Catalonia, seeking to enshrine a similar degree of red democracy in the young state as the French have managed to achieve in their commune. They are likely to gain many votes from the surviving republicans from more liberal parties, as well as the support of agrarian vineyard workers and other peasants thanks to their somewhat rural-minded outlook."

CAT.22.d:0 "As stability returns to Catalonia, the second Catalan democratic elections are held far earlier than was initially planned. Compared to the first elections, far fewer parties are also taking part in the elections, as after general Batet defeated JEREC and consolidated his rule, he made sure to purge the republican administration from various ideological firebrands and agitators, leaving only trusted moderates as possible electable parties. Batet himself has decided to join the nascent nationalist party, Partit Nacionalista Català, which up until recently had maintained connections to Estat Catala and Nosaltres Sols radicals, but found itself bereft of support after their disbandment. The party is now mostly made up of right-wing nationalists and military officers.\n\n Both Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya and Acció Catalana Republicana have undergone swift changes as well, as after the death of Lluis Companys, Josep Tarradellas took over the party leadership and guided it towards a more left-wing nationalist direction. While still heavily involved in labour affairs, Tarradellas is known for his conciliatory stance with Spaniards, and has advocated for wider, more inclusive nationalism, renaming the party to Partit Nacionalista Republicà d'Esquerra.\n\n Acció Catalana Republicana has also underwent changes after its leader, Luis Nicolau d'Olwer, died by the hands of the Escamots, and its new leader, Joaquim de Camps i Arboix, has renamed the party to simply Acció Catalana, given its shift away from republican radicalism of Nicolau d’Olwer. Finally, the only party to remain largely unchanged is the Unió Democràtica de Catalunya, still governed by Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera, and the party continues to follow Christian democratic principles. Few expect the other parties to win, however, as Batet’s success in governing Catalonia is bound to give his new party an immense boost in the elections, but as always, the results are not rock solid.

BAS.23.d:0 "As ERC continues to march from one victory to another, it seems that the time has finally come for the reckoning of the Escamots. Originally conceived by Estat Catala under the auspices of Francesc Macia, these paramilitaries were meant to ensure that whenever the day of Catalan independence arrived, Catalonian patriots would have the teeth and claws to hold into it against the Spanish menace. However, their unruly nature and fascination with extremism has only grown with our independence, and Josep Dencàs i Puigdollers, their leader, is known to want a state that is both nationalist and syndicalist, clearly taking ideas from the Third Internationale’s Charter Totalists. This is simply unacceptable, for the presence of Escamot Totalists would allow our political enemies to have a field day, accusing us of sympathizing with the democracy-despising Totalists.\n\n Not only are they a political burden, their risk to the collective Catalan society is considerable. They are also known to harbour dangerous terrorists, such as Miquel Badia, a famous bodyguard of Francesc Macia, infamous for his brutal and ruthless actions against anarchists and Spanish nationalists. Some cynics do point out that Lluis Companys might have his own motives for removing Badia, as the men are said to share a mutual hatred and disgust of one another. Whatever ERC is to do against the Escamot threat, it must be done covertly, and fast, or their influence among the firebrand nationalists of Catalonia will grow too strong to control."

The government has discussed the situation at length, and many ideas on how to deal with the Escamot threat have been raised, ranging from utilizing spies to infiltrate their ranks to discredit the radical wing, sending the Mossos to forcibly disband the movement or ordering them to spread around the Catalan countryside to hunt ‘Spanish traitors’ while we strike their headquarters and arrest the leadership. However, the moderates support a plan where we would approach lower-ranking, but still influential, members of the Escamots, seeking to turn them towards the inner clique of radicals so that we can take down the movement from the inside. This would be more time consuming, but with the help of inside collaborators, we could decapitate the radical leadership quickly and hopefully, relatively bloodlessly, leading to the rest of Escamots capitulating without their rabblerouser leaders. \n\nHowever, many within ERC ranks consider this option too risky, claiming that we cannot truly trust that the collaborators would not double cross us and lead us into a trap. Instead, they believe that if we are to muster a large enough force of the Mossos d’Esquarda and march towards the JEREC headquarters, demanding their surrender in a show of power, we could scare them into giving up their extremist leadership. This would obviously also act as a power move towards other Catalan parties, to dissuade their leaders from extremist ideals as well. However, Tarradellas and Companys have been critical of this plan, as many still view Mossos as a pro-Spanish force, and there is always the lingering possibility that the Escamots will not surrender, leading to a bloodbath if neither side gives in."

Upon arriving to the headquarters of the JEREC organization, their vehicles screeched to a halt, and while gunners covered the unloading process, numerous squads of stone-faced policemen flooded the street. In mere moments, the building was encircled. Weapons trained on the building, the policemen began to march towards it, watching the windows. Their leader, Enrique Pérez Farrás, demanded that the JEREC leadership come out of the building and face the police force directly for their arrest, on the grounds of multiple atrocities performed during the independence war and suspected links to the Internationale Totalist movements.\n\n The situation was immediately made far more tense as the Escamot squads present manned the windows, armed with rifles, pistols and submachine guns. Around the city, there were reports of Escamots converging on the headquarters location. However, given that neither side had yet opened fire, the possibility of a peaceful solution was not yet ruled out. Nonetheless, as both sides watched one another through ironsights, this possibility was seemingly less likely by every passing minute."

The yard was littered with dead Mossos, the windows of the house had been shot to pieces and dozens of Escamots lay on the floor, dead or bleeding out. Yet the Mossos, despite their numerical superiority, had been caught in a difficult position. The yard provided little cover, and the street, while littered with vehicles, had suffered greatly from enemy fire.\n\n The Escamots, for their part, had suffered a great deal of losses, but their will was not broken, and their leader, Miquel Badia, had rallied the men for a counter-attack. The few remaining Escamots with automatic weapons opened fire on the trucks below, and as the doors of the building flew open, the paramilitary force sprang out. The returning salvo from the policemen, neutered partially by the suppressing fire of the Escamots, cut down some of the attackers, but in a determined charge, the siege was broken. The victorious militants harried the retreating policemen viciously, and as the battle’s tide turned, squads of Escamots managed to rejoin the main force, led by Badia and the main leader of JEREC, Josep Dencas.\n\n The Mossos, beaten and battered, pulled forces from all around the city to prepare a defense of the Palau de Catalunya. However, with the Escamots reinforced, the possibility of a government victory seemed uncertain. The parliament urged president Companys to immediately send command to the Catalan army to crush the revolt, but Companys hesitated. The army, still undergoing training, had many Escamot members in its ranks, from command to foot soldiers. Whether it could be trusted or not was unknown."

CAT.27.d:0 "The Escamots, bolstered by their victory at the JEREC headquarters, were enthralled by the prospect of total victory. Sporadic resistance, both from the retreating Mossos and few squads of anarchist militias, had held the Escamot main force back for roughly half an hour. While this had been a boon for the Mossos, who were busy preparing a defence line before the Palau de Catalunya, their preparations were hasty at best. The remaining police force was struggling to man the line, and their best weapons had been lost in the siege. A single tiznao, armed with the only working machine gun left, now stood as the centrepiece of the defensive line. However, the vehicle was low on ammunition, and while more supplies were on the way, it was uncertain if they would reach the front in time. Rest of the line was manned by men with rifles, pistols and revolvers, with a few Astra carbines providing much needed firepower.\n\n As the last few pieces of debris were rolled into place to act as barricades, the Escamot vanguard arrived. A hundred man strong force, made up of the most veteran fighters, slammed itself into the line of the Mossos like an avalanche. The tiznao’s gun tried to hold them at bay, but it was eventually torched as one of the attackers got close enough with a firebomb. The policemen held their line admirably, reaping a terrible toll on the attacking Escamots as they advanced on the narrow city streets, yet the paramilitaries struck back with the same ferocity.\n\n When the vanguard finally buckled and broke to a rout, the Mossos line had thinned considerably. Dozens lay dead among their barricades, and more were wounded by bullets or bombs. When the Escamot main force rounded the corner, the government loyalists prepared for a final stand. As the attack came, the police force held for a moment, firing everything they had in a desperate attempt to hold, but as more and more fell in the stubborn assault of the Escamots, the remaining officers finally broke. As the final defenders broke into a panicked sprint, the paramilitaries of Dencas assembled into a proper advance formation, almost parade-esque in nature, and began marching towards the parliament. There, taken aback by the rapid turn of events, the government attempted to form an escape plan, but with the paramilitary forces circling in from all sides, the likelihood of success for such a venture seemed dim."

CAT.28.d:0 "News travel fast in Catalonia, and when the proclamation of a monarchy reached the streets of Tarragona, Barcelona and Valencia, the shockwaves were immense. For some, like the Carlists, Catalan businessmen and clergy, it meant the beginning of heavy campaigning. For others, it was a sign to begin heavy protesting, as Republicanism had already taken hold in the hearts of many Catalans. But there were also those, such as the anarchists of CNT-FAI, who saw the proclamation of a Catalan kingdom as an absolute anathema to the very existence of the new nation. Had the anarchists not fought and bled to see the separation of Catalonia from the Spanish crown, to see the plunderers of the people’s wealth driven from the coast of Mediterranean to their lairs in Madrid? CNT-FAI local councils in Alt Llobregat, a mining and textile region, launched a general strike, supported by allies in the Unió Socialista de Catalunya-aligned union, Unió General de Sindicats Obrers de Catalunya and Partit Català Proletari-aligned union, Centre Autonomista de Dependents de Comerç i Industria.\n\n The region, while important for its industry, is not particularly central to the functions of Catalonia, but such an insurrection of laborers could inspire other areas of the new nation into action. Already, local businesses have been forcibly collectivized, telephone lines to rest of Catalonia severed, the region’s mines completely shut down, and Senyeras torn from their flagpoles so that the red and black standards of anarchism could be hoisted. Some actors within CNT-FAI have gone so far as to call for the establishment of libertarian communism in Catalonia, though it seems like majority of the workers are just in it to get better pay and rights, and as a half-hearted protest at the monarchy.\n\n The local Mossos units ran into fistfights with the anarchists, which further escalated into some exchanges of fire, though so far it seems that this was mostly used as a deterrent by both forces. However, the clock is ticking, as citizens frightened by the prospect of an anarchist insurrection have began forming the so-called Somaten formations, harping back to the original units of similar name that fought street battles with the anarchists during the years of the Pistolerismo. General Batet has called for the government to negotiate a deal, as he believes the anarchists will not push for total revolution given the middling support they have outside of Barcelona."

CAT.29.d:0 "As the sun reached its zenith over the region of Alt Llobregat, the anarchist militias holding the mining compound of Fígols spotted a convoy heading their way. The two vehicles acting as the vanguard were rare non-converted armoured vehicles in Catalan hands, the Bilbao-class pre-war cars with two machine guns and a quite boxy exterior. They were followed by a dozen trucks, filled to the brim with Mossos troops. The anarchists had built barricades for such an expected government counter-attack, though this particular column was far larger than they had anticipated. It would seem that the conservative government was taking no chances. The armoured cars rolled into a halt about half a kilometre from the compound gate, and the commander of the column addressed the gathered militants through a loudspeaker mounted to the vehicle for emergency use. He ordered the gathered anarchist force to disband and discontinue the strike, as he was authorized to view the situation as an on-going insurgency if the militants would continue their occupation of the towns of Alt Llobregat, and was thus obliged to use even lethal means to drive them out.\n\n Before any verbal response was given, an anarchist marksman fired a shot from one of the buildings and managed to strike the Mossos commander, killing him on the spot. The vehicles opened fire, and the Mossos force moved in, their overwhelming firepower giving them far greater leverage in the battle. The anarchist pickets began to buckle, as they were ran down by the concentrated push, and many militants fell seconds before they could escape further into the compound. As the determined assault continued, only the hardliner anarchists holding the compound, such as the Ascaso brothers, Francisco and Domingo, leading the insurgency, remained stalwart in the face of the attack.\n\n The anarchists had lost twelve fighters in the initial battle, and many of the less ideologically fervent members of the movement were now feeling the ground burn beneath their feet, looking for ways out of the situation. As the struggle continued, with anarchists ambushing the Mossos on some streets and holding their advance back, casualties piling even on the attackers’ side, the battle seemed to stagnate. However, as the Bilbaos managed to crush through the barricades, the anarchist defeat was sealed, as the hail of bullets their weapons spat out was too much for the insurgents to withstand. As the final defences broke into a rout, the militia members fled into all directions, fighting running battles with the Mossos squads on the rough Catalan countryside.\n\n However, the Mossos, eager to stop the revolt from spreading to other towns and settlements of Alt Llobregat, tried to capture as many of the fleeing men as they could. Many runners would be captured or shot, but when night finally arrived, the Mossos’ command was still unsure if most of the stragglers were caught or not."

However, the Mossos police force had enacted a rapid reaction to the situation at Alt Llobregat, and many prominent anarchists had been captured, killed in skirmishes or driven to exile by the Catalan police force. CNT-FAI maintained a strong strike action, but the conservative government of Francisco Cambo remained unphased in the face of the anarchists’ demands, and the Mossos were ordered to continue the repression of strikers. The unity of CNT-FAI was buckling under the pressure, as the supporters of the possibilist side of the movement were pressuring the more radical clique of anarchists, led by Juan Garcia Oliver, to cease their provocation of the government before it would completely destroy CNT-FAI as an unified entity.\n\n However, Garcia Oliver remained resolute, causing the Nosotros faction within CNT-FAI to gain more power. Nosotros, made up of the most radical and militant members of FAI, were less interested in unionism and focused more on military means in the takeover of Catalonia by the anarchists. The Ascaso brothers had promoted their view of government stepping on the rights of the workers in Alt Llobregat, and now continued to paint the future of Catalonia as one where the monarchists would slowly pick apart the labour organizations in similar battles. The Nosotros wing of the organization had started talks with other left-wing movements in Catalonia after prompting from the leader of Partit Català Proletari, Jaume Compte i Canelles, and the possibility of an even wider strike organized by the various parties and unions of Catalonia, Balearics and Valencia seemed like it could come into fruition. \n\nHowever, the anarchists, driven to a corner by the sudden loss of their numbers and much of their stockpiles in police raids, were fearful that if such a strike came, and possibly led to a true revolution, the Marxists of Partit Català Proletari would try to seize power for themselves, similar to the events of Russian Revolution. Knowing that PCP would be unable to seize power by themselves, the Nosotros leadership pressured Compte to agree to a compromise, where the different labour movements would support one another to achieve power, and once victory would be achieved, there would be true socialist democratic elections similar to those held in Commune of France."

The man has a feared reputation in Catalonia, for he is infamous for being the bodyguard of Francesc Macia, and also for his antics as Estat Catala’s chief of terror. Among the anarchists, he is known for capturing them during various clashes between Estat Catala and CNT-FAI, driving them throughout Barcelona while holding them on the edge of the car and claiming that he could kill them any moment. Even more notorious is his preferred method of terrorizing his prisoners, by lining them up facing a wall, setting up a firing squad behind them and then ordering the said squad to fire.\n\n The riflemen would purposefully fire over the heads of the prisoners, and then another group of guards would toss rocks at the backs of the prisoners, to cause panic and extreme discomfort in the victims as they could never know when actual execution came. While not particularly politically relevant beyond his brutal and repressive tactics, he is nonetheless one of the most militant members of the Escamots, and wields considerable influence among the surviving paramilitaries. Reports indicate that he could be trying to escape to France, as while he is not particularly interested in syndicalist politics, his involvement with Dencas, known sympathizer of National Syndicalism, could buy him some support among the Communards or Italian Totalists. However, other members of Batet’s inner circle claim that the man is little more than a brute, a blunt tool for Estat Catala, and his ability to organize a rising against our rule would be nonexistent."

But first, they would have to cross the border and escape the patrols of Exercit Popular, whose involvement had driven the men to their escape. They had managed to escape their pursuiters by hiding in the Catalan countryside villages for more than a week now, but as the sound of three engines could be heard bouncing from the mighty cliffs around them, it would seem that the Escamot survivors luck had ran out. Two motorcycles rounded the corner behind the fugitives, and the loud barking of automatic carbines was the only indication the Escamots needed to know that they had been caught. The driver pushed the gas pedal further down, causing the tortured engine to lunge the vehicle forward violently, and this sudden motion made the burst fired by the military police miss completely.\n\n The three vehicles struggled to stay on the serpentine road, made even harder once Badia’s guards began to fire back with their handguns. As bullets were exchanged, one of the henchmen managed to strike the engine of the police motorcycle, causing it to sputter and drag behind the chase until the driver and gunner had to give up and turn back. The other motorcycle continued harassing the car, its gunner finally hitting one of Badia’s guards. His limp body struck the ground and caused the driver of the pursuing vehicle to steer to the side, almost turning the entire motorcycle over. Desperation was setting in inside Badia’s escape car, and the driver felt fatigue settle in as he made yet another last minute swerve around a corner. To their shock, a truck carrying goods for the local market was barreling towards them behind the corner, and the drivers of both Badia’s car and the chasing motorcycle had mere seconds to react accordingly to avoid a full frontal collision."

As the final formations reached their positions, the Catalan nationalist leader began his speech addressing the men of JEREC below him.\n\n He spoke at length of the horrors of the Spanish rule, the shackling of Catalonia to a dying empire, and how the sycophants of Lluis Companys and Francesc Cambo had sold the region to Spain in exchange for crumbs, only attempting to escape the clutches of Castile after the inevitable betrayal by the Bourbons.

Lluis Companys and Luis Nicolau d'Olwer, were among the fallen, but for the most part, the parliament building had been captured with only a few escapees. With heavily-armed Escamot guards flanking him, and the vigilant eyes of Miquel Badia’s stormtrooper squads watching the crowd, Josep Dencas climbed to the podium of the Catalan parliament. The politicians before him watched the man with a mixture of fear, hatred, and some, with opportunism. Dencas began his speech by denouncing the former government, calling its attempt to arrest JEREC leadership a clear sign that they had no interest in the actual lives of Catalans, and simply wanted to grab as much power as possible.\n\n He railed against Companys, calling him a weak-minded fool for collaborating with the Spaniards and anarchists, and claimed that now that the president was gone, Catalonia could finally be transformed into a state that was both nationalist, and syndicalist, not the aimless ultranationalism of Nosaltres Sols nor the anarchist-compromised syndicalism of CNT, but a truly efficient hybrid that would propel Catalonia into a proper nationhood.  Dencàs claimed that following the victory of JEREC, the Catalan parliament would be dissolved, to safeguard the state from such opportunists as Companys, and that under JEREC, the state would oversee the removal of Spanish influences from the society once and for all.\n\n According to Dencàs, the lingering Spanish influence would forever taint the Catalan purity, both spiritually and physically, and thus it would have to be exorcized from the new nation. Ending his speech by shouting ‘Visca Catalunya’, his only choir were the gathered Escamot troops, with the rest of the chamber remaining silent in utter disbelief at the turn of events. As Badia began to round up the politicians, who would be imprisoned until those useful enough for the regime could be separated from the dissidents, Dencàs turned towards the Palau’s front, aiming to climb onto the balcony to address his men, the Escamot legions gathered in front of the parliament building.

Many nationalists, especially from Nosaltres Sols, had also joined the strike in solidarity, mainly out of their hatred for Lliga Catalana. The government, due to its stubbornness, had completely disregarded any calls for negotiation, and sought to employ Exercit Popular in the suppression of the strikes, but General Batet had thus far been hesitant to do so, seeing the sheer size of the striker crowds and the soured public opinion towards Cambo’s party. However, the government threatened to discharge Batet, and he was forced to intervene, trying to minimize clashes with the strikers and to open dialogue with the strike leadership.\n\n Companys and few other more moderate members of the strike leadership seemed open to such negotiations, but when the situation dragged on and military seemed to pull their punches a little too much, Batet was forced to relinquish power to Colonel Frederic Escofet i Alsina. Escofet’s orders were to suppress the riots with a strong hand, and as Exercit Popular spread around Barcelona to smash apart the picket lines, for a moment it seemed to work out.\n\n However, the left-wing resistance grew, and their constant calls to depose the Spanish sympathizers of Liga from power started to appeal to the unmotivated conscripts. More and more units began to drop out of action, either deserting or outright joining the strikers, and by the time the Liga government could react, the general strike had erupted into a full-scale revolution. The militias of Partit Catala Proletari stormed the parliament with the help of turncoat army units, and as the democratic government escaped the area, the leader of PCP, Jaume Compte i Canelles, declared that the liberal republic of Catalonia had come to an end, replaced by one that would finally pay heed to the plights of the proletariat.

This defamation campaign was very heavily organized by a small clique of Spanish officers left in Catalonia, who had secretly plotted to seize the reins of power from the tired old general once opportunity arose. Batet, despite his strong popular support, was bereft of real allies in the military, and conceded to the demands of his subordinates, retiring to a villa in Tarragona. This small clique, now given the keys to governance of Catalonia, was made up of officers who up until now had claimed to support the regime, had always done so more due to fearing reprisals from their superior Batet, and out of survival instinct as they had been unable to escape Catalonia.\n\n After the Spanish junta had driven out the monarchy, the many officers harbouring monarchist sympathies had began to plot with local remaining Alfonsists, and now, under the nominal leadership of the puppet leader Antonio Escobar Huertas. However, while Escobar was the face of the new junta, being known for his republican connections to placate the Catalans, the real heads of the military rule were Colonel Fernando Moreno Calderón, Lieutenant Colonel José Aizpuru Martín-Pinillos and Commander Antonio Algar Quintana.

The regime of Exercit Popular, under the stewardship of General Domenec Batet, had enforced a strict martial law over Catalonia, though Barcelona remained the only part where it was truly effective. Yet as the military rule solidified, the number of night-time patrols were cut in half and even then, were mostly manned by conscripts instead of the earlier elite squads of the army. Yet the threat of an insurgency had slowly grown under the seemingly tranquill streets of Barcelona, and now, Miquel Badia, or Capità Collons as he had become known as, sought revenge for the fall of JEREC. The remaining Escamots, not particularly strong in numbers, had coalesced under the rule of Badia after he managed to evade Batet’s grasp, and the recent removal of Batet had proven an excellent opportunity for the nationalist leader to strike once more.\n\n The army, still quite inexperienced and not particularly motivated, had become even less so after their hero Batet was removed and replaced with an uncharismatic man of Spanish birth. As the moon rose over Catalan sky, Badia’s small force slipped into the sewers, traveling long hours amid the darkness as they made their way towards the military headquarters. The barracks of the IV Organic brigade, where Batet had made his final decision to join the Catalan revolt, were now the very head of Catalan state, where the new clique of officers prepared to consolidate their rule over the young nation.\n\n Yet as the guards of the complex prepared for a watch shift, they were overwhelmed in mere seconds by Escamot commandoes, slipping the watchmen’s throats before any alarm could be rang. Rest of their force rose from the sewer pipes and quickly prepared their gear, consisting of multiple machine pistols, carbines and grenades. The force split into multiple squads, which all attacked different sections of the military complex. During the next half an hour, machine gun fire and explosions rang all around the different buildings of the headquarters, army guards being slain in their beds from automatic fire or blown to pieces by grenades. Those few that managed to resist, were cut down mercilessly by the invaders, though not before taking a few Escamots with them. Badia himself led a squad into the very heart of the complex, his group storming the officers’ room and decapitating the leadership of Exercit Popular in one fell swoop. Utilizing the radio transmitters of the base, Badia sent his ultimatum to rest of Catalonia, denouncing the leadership of Exercit Popular as Spanish-backed autocrats, and declaring the rule of his militant group, the Holy Brotherhood of the Black Banner over Catalonia."

However, the military is on our side, and the populist strategies utilized by the monarcho-socialists have made the government very popular among the workers.

Inviting him back would be a sure-fire way to make the Catalans revolt, but there are others who could fill his role. The most likely option is the first heir of Alfonso XIII, the younger Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, who was removed from the succession after his marriage to a Cuban commoner. This could make him more appealing to the people as well, showing that he is a man of the people first and a monarch second. However, his relation to the Spanish royals, even as an outcast, could be a problem.\n\n Other options are available, however, as we could instead invite Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart y Falcó to the throne. He is also connected to the Spanish royals, but nonetheless, he is notable for being the a far descendant of Martin I of Aragon, who ruled Catalonia and Aragon in the Middle Ages. While outlandish, it would be a more local choice, and the restoration of the House of Barcelona could appeal more to our subjects than the restoration of a Bourbon to the throne. Jacobo is also a distinguished diplomat and politician, and while he may have his reservations of helping a new Catalan state, it might appeal to him given the chaos in mainland Spain now. Alternatively, if Jacobo himself does not want to become the king, we could offer the crown to his daughter and only child, Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart. While quite young, he could prove to be a good monarch for our purposes given that she does not come with the burden of connections with the Spanish monarchy, at least not to the degree of the other candidates.

CAT.207.t:0 "The Future Course of Partido Socialista Monárquico"
CAT.207.d:0 "The monarcho-socialists of Catalonia have thus far leaned more into their monarchist roots, aligning more with the various nobles and traditionalists left in Catalonia to ensure that the movement doesn’t crumble at the face of its rather gigantic task of governing the Catalans. However, while monarchists to the death, the old members of the party have always also had a strong love for the people, and sought to merge the love for the working class of non-Marxist socialism with the loyalty to the true leader of the nation, the monarch. As such, the party leadership, especially the more left-leaning members like Elías Miró Solé and Francisco Martínez, have sought to limit the influence of the more traditionalist clique of the Partido Socialista Monárquico. This struggle has largely remained in the sidelines, with more important problems taking the spotlight of the party’s efforts, but now that things have stabilized, the party must finally choose its actual policies. The socialist-aligned members have been bolstered by a few moderate socialists of ERC and USC, as well as previously apolitical workers, and these men now call for the movement to truly go socialist in nature, though still highly moderate and loyal to the crown. Others, more moderate members such as José Ferrando Albors, have instead lobbied for the adoption of a social democratic model, not fully leaning to socialism but still leaving the more traditionalist mindsets of old behind. Still, the strength of the traditionalists, backed by some military officers, is not to be taken lightly, and they could be difficult to dislodge from their place of power."

CAT.244.t:0 "Vindication for the Garraf Affair"
CAT.244.d:0 "The leader of Partit Català Proletari, Jaume Compte i Canelles, became famous in Catalan insurgent circles for his part in the Garraf plot, an attempted assanssination of Alfonso XIII in 1925, in the tunnel near Garraf. The assassination attempt, perpetrated by the group Bandera Negra, a clandestine combat wing of Estat Català, was the culmination of a series of events, including multiple attempts to place the bomb into a tunnel where Alfonso’s train would have to pass through, an attempt to strike at the king in the streets of Barcelona, and other various attempts at his life, mostly foiled by circumstances or police interference. The members of the group were eventually captured, tortured and sentenced by the military, and Compte was meant to be executed, but the arrival of the republic foiled these plans.\n\n The eventual goal of the strike had always been the rousing of Catalans into action following the military crackdowns that would follow the king’s death, to finally see the Catalans proclaim their own, independent republic. However, the king lived to see another day, and now resides in Portugal, continuing to enjoy the riches pillaged from the people of Iberia. Nosaltres Sols assassin almost claimed his life and sent the king to the depths of hell, but unfortunately despite the best attempts of these Catalan patriots, the plot was foiled. However, given all the experience our troops have received in the recent years, fighting against imperialists and capitalists alike, we now possess a small group of expert commandos.\n\n With the Bourbon royal family in exile, they’re mostly protected by a small cadre of loyalists, not the domineering legions of Guardia Civil they had to order around back in 1925. Perhaps the time has come to strike again, to see the mistakes of Garraf plot rectified and the Bourbon bastards sentenced for their crimes through the heavy-handed justice of insurgent law. Killing Alfonso of course would not be a particularly massive contribution in our fight against the Hispanic beast, given the king is despised even by the junta currently controlling Madrid, but it would nonetheless be a massive propaganda victory for the cause of Catalanism and anti-imperialism world-wide, to see one of the crown-headed buffoons brought to justice."

CAT.245.t:0 "Bombing Near Lisbon!"
CAT.245.d:0 "Earlier today, at exactly five in the morning, sirens started blaring all over Lisbon after a booming explosion caused one of the train tunnels leading to the city to collapse on top of an incoming train. The rescue crews arrived to the scene quickly, but little could be done to save the victims after tons of stone, concrete and earth had submerged the carriages and the locomotive. According to a report from the ministry of transportation, the train had been carrying the exiled Spanish royal family, including the old king Alfonso XIII and both potential heirs, Juan and Jaime, as well as their mother and a company of servants and guards. The few remaining survivors and eyewitnesses described a massive eruption of fire and debris from the tunnel as most of the carriages had entered, and only the very rearmost wagon had survived intact, though blown to the side by the impact of the explosion.\n\n This event, clearly perpetrated by some Spanish or separatist militants, has been received with mixed reactions over the border, with the junta mostly ambivalent, and the Basques, Galicians and Catalans in open jubilation of the deaths of the hated Bourbon family. However, the local villagers, after being questioned, pointed out that a group of suspicious individuals had arrived to the nearby hamlet not long before the attack, and according to one eyewitness, spoke Catalan or Galician. The Galician government has already denounced the attack, but the socialist Catalan government has done nothing of that nature. The Portuguese government is inclined to send a letter demanding the Catalan government to immediately apologize for the event, even if perpetrated by rogue actors, and to pay for the damages done to Portugal’s road network, or more drastic measures must be taken so that the collective Iberian security is upheld."

CAT.246.d:0 "The commando squad sent to Portugal have returned, reporting complete mission success. The train Alfonso and his entourage had traveled on was completely destroyed, and the former royals were finally punished for their crimes against Iberian peoples. The mission was also critical for the Catalan army, as it gave much needed experience on infiltration missions, but not everything in the plot was a shining victory.\n\n Somehow, the blasted Portuguese agents managed to gather enough information to pin the attack on our infiltrators, and now, the Portuguese crown is demanding that we formally apologize for the attack on their soil and pay for the damages done to their rail network. As some token of pragmatism, the Portuguese government is offering to blame the attack on ‘radical elements’ within the Catalan society. However, many within Catalonia would see such an apology as a clear sign of weakness, and given the threat of counter-revolutionaries being a constant one, we can ill-afford giving them such a boon. Yet still, remaining defiant may very well drag us into something far more dangerous than a few counter-revolutionaries."

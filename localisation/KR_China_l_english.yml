Soldiers are notoriously poorly trained and disorderly, often recruited from a varied stock of bandits, petty criminals, and the chronically destitute. Equipment is regularly patchwork, obsolete, or even downright archaic. Loyalty is typically given to individual officers, or a regularly filled ricebowl, and ideological motivation is ephemeral at best. It will take a great deal to rebuild these armies along modern lines.\n"

china_shared.1.d: "The United Front may have brought a measure of unity to our fractured country, but the internal conflicts between Chinese factions never truly ended. Now, our losses in the face of the Japanese invasion have forced our government to recognize a simple truth: we can no longer claim to be China's leader in the face of foreign invasion. Already forces under various warlords and regional governments have begun routinely ignoring our directives in favor of those from [current_china_leader.GetNameDef]. Unless we push forward and retake our lost territory we stand to permanently lose our leadership status."
china_shared.1.a: "Drat."

china_shared.2.t: "A United Front"
china_shared.2.d: "With Japan's invasion beginning to gather steam, [Root.GetLeader] has decided to make a call for national unity against the invader, even if it means fighting alongside our former enemies. Even as the country's communication infrastructure has come under threat, the message will go out at once - by courier if necessary!"
china_shared.2.a: "For China!"

china_shared.3.t: "A Call For Unity"
china_shared.3.d: "Scholars, intellectuals, and various idealogues have made calls for national unity against foreign aggression routinely over the years. It has been a nice rallying cry, if one that often fell on deaf ears. Now, with Japan's invasion rolling across a significant portion of the country,[From.GetNameDef] has made a call for a temporary alliance against Japan, and this time perhaps other leaders will listen. Even the most cynical must admit that China's fate seems to hang in the balance."
china_shared.3.a: "Yes, we must band together."
china_shared.3.b: "We shall never fight alongside them!"

china_shared.4.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the United Front"
china_shared.4.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has joined the United Front, pledging all their resources and influence to the anti-Japanese cause. This will not bring an end to any historical rivalries, or claims to legitimate national leadership, but nontheless our troops will now be fighting side by side against the foreign aggressor."
china_shared.4.a: "Excellent."

china_shared.5.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Betrayal"
china_shared.5.d: "In an act of wanton betrayal, [From.GetNameDef] has refused to join the United Front. There can be no excuse for putting individual interests before the fate of all China!"
china_shared.5.a: "Traitors!"

china_shared.6.t: "[current_china_leader.GetNameDefCap] Offers a Ceasefire"
china_shared.6.d: "With [From.GetNameDef] joining the United Front, [current_china_leader.GetNameDef], has offered to broker a ceasefire between [From.GetNameDef] and our regime, solely in the national interest, until such a time as the Japanese invasion is halted. The agreement is conditional on the transfer of all occupied territories on both of our sides, however."
china_shared.6.a: "Yes. For now."

china_shared.9.t: "Formation of the United Front"
china_shared.9.d: "Ever since the Japanese invasion cries have gone up across the country for a united front against Japanese aggression, and now they have been heard. Today marks the formation of the United Front, dedicated to the expulsion of the Japanese and their influence from our Chinese soil. Now our fates are tied as one, and there can be only victory or anhiliation."
china_shared.9.a: "The Japanese must be defeated."

china_shared.10.t: "The United Front Fails"
china_shared.10.d: "It seems that not even an existential threat will unite the squabbling Chinese factions. After a month of negotiations and calls for aid, no other factions proved willing to put their differences with our regime aside - not even to stop the Japanese invasion. Our fate, apparently, is to fall divided."
china_shared.10.a: "This is a dark day..."

china_shared.11.t: "Collapse of the United Front"
china_shared.11.d: "Even as the war with Japan began to move toward its close, many in China were already making covert moves toward one side or another in the post-war order. With Japan now defeated, those suppressed conflicts have again come to the fore, and what was one a united front has began a rapid slide into infighting. Now the final phase of China's unification wars has begun."
china_shared.11.a: "One last obstacle towards unification."

china_shared.12.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the United Front"
china_shared.12.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has left the United Front, decrying the alliance as now 'unnecessary' and 'limiting' to their needs and ambitions."
china_shared.12.a: "So much for unity."

china_shared.13.t: "The United Front Forms"
china_shared.13.d.pro_JAP: "It seems some of our fellow Chinese, unwilling to acknowledge our latest string of victories, have deicded to band together against us and our Japanese allies. While Tokyo is already considering this last-ditch alliance insignificant, we know China better than they ever could, and that a long fight still awaits ahead." #Pro-Japan Chinese POV
china_shared.13.d.anti_JAP: "After a string of secret meetings carried out over several weeks, several Chinese political factions including our own have agreed to stand together against the oncoming Japanese invasion. Unity has been elusive for decades, but now with the formation of the Chinese United Front the country finally stands a chance at repelling the Japanese invader, and crushing his traitorus allies." #Anti-Japan Chinese POV
china_shared.13.d.JAP: "It seems that several Chinese factions, unwilling to acknowledge our latest string of victories and the overwhelming superiority of our armies, have deicded to band together against us. It is difficult to imagine the squabbling, cliquish Chinese truly working together toward a common cause, and our commanders have assured us that theirs is ultimately a futile measure. We will be sipping Sake amid the ruins of their headquarters by the end of the year." #Japanese POV
china_shared.13.d.others: "It seems that the Chinese, in their desperation to slow the Japanese invasion of their country, have formed an alliance. Few expected the typically squabbling, cliquish Chinese factions to make such a move, and now many will watch their future with considerable interest." #Foreign POV
china_shared.13.a: "Onward."
china_shared.13.b: "Wansui!"
china_shared.13.c: "Banzai!"
china_shared.13.e: "Interesting."

china_shared.14.t: "Collapse of the United Front"
china_shared.14.d.CHI: "In retrospect, the collapse of the United Front appears to have been inevitable. As a fish cannot leave the water, nor could the Front survive devoid of desperation. However, for some time, the whole of China was united behind a single purpose, marching in step toward a shared goal. Even as the dark clouds of civil war loom, there is now a shining example of what could be, and perhaps what will be, once again." #Chinese POV
china_shared.14.d.JAP: "It seems that the Chinese United Front, always beset by internal squabbling, has finally collapsed in the absence of our once overwhelming military might. Amid these days of reflection on what we might have been, an indomitable giant standing astride all of Asia, here is further proof of the dangers of western imperialism. We may have been defeated by China, but at least we remain united as one nation, beneath His Majesty the Emperor. Our destiny is still our own." #Japanese POV
china_shared.14.d.others: "The Chinese United Front, always beset by internal partisan squabbling, has finally dissolved in the absence of Japan's once overwhelming threat to its independence. The whole nation now seems set to plunge again into the fires of civil war which have consumed it, almost uninterrupted, for a generation. For many in the coastal cities and outside China this is hardly unexpected news, as the nation's tumults have  been regulars on broadsheet pages, but many experts will be paying close attention over the next several months. This round of conflict may well be China's last, as the playing-field has narrowed considerably." #Foreign POV
china_shared.14.a: "China long divided, must unite." #Chinese POV
china_shared.14.b: "We have peace while they keep chaos." #Japanese POV

china_shared.1000.d: "The Heirloom Seal of the Realm is a long-lost Imperial artifact that once served as the official seal and stamp of approval of the Emperors of China. Crafted by the first Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang after consolidating the Qin Dynasty, the stamp was carved from the Heshibi - a famous and beautifully ornate jade bi, or ceremonial disc, that once belonged to the leaders of the Zhao state. The stamp, made of jade which symbolized Chinese regality and the inner beauty of humanity, was inscribed with the motto ‘Having received the Mandate of Heaven, may the Emperor lead a long and prosperous life’, and served as the official stamp of the office of the Emperor of centuries. \n\nHowever, the original Heirloom Seal was tragically lost during Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period during the 10th Century, and since then, every dynasty has tried to find it, for the stamp has come to represent the physical embodiment of the Mandate of Heaven. So desperate to find this heirloom, the Qing Dynasty of the Manchus produced hundreds of forgeries and fakes in order to depreciate the value of the original while also making it much harder to find, or if found, verified. Now that our Dynasty controls China, we must begin the search for this impossible-to-find artifact, while also producing our own fakes along the way, for whoever holds the one, true stamp has a claim to the Chinese throne."
china_shared.1000.a: "One stamp to rule them all."

china_events.0.d.target: "Reports from the border indicate that we will soon be under attack from our wretched neighbours in [FROM.GetName]. Dissatisfied with our government, [FROM.GetLeader] has formally denounced us before a crowd in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Since then, more and more units have amassed along the border. Small skirmishes have already begun as our opponents make probing attacks and tensions spike. We must hurry to our defence, lest we be crushed under the weight of our foes."
china_events.0.d.ally_of_target: "We have received a warning from our allies in [FROM.GetName] that an invasion from [FROM.FROM.GetName] is on the horizon. Both sides have already begun preparation for such a conflict as the border grows increasingly tense. Given our prior obligations to [FROM.GetName], we will likely be drawn into this conflict. We must begin scrambling troops of our own immediately - let us hope that our decision to ally with the [FROM.GetAdjective] was not made too hastily."
china_events.0.a: "Assemble the general staff!"

china_events.1.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Submission"
china_events.1.d: "Confident in their growing strength or perhaps merely seeking to project it in these times of troubles, we have received a series of demands from [FROM.GetLeader]'s government demanding our immediate recognition of their authority. This would naturally entail the stationing of troops, adhering to their decrees and likely further tributes that would naturally be sent to a national government.\n\nCalling their bluff of course, is always an option. It will likely mean war, though freedom from tyranny often requires such a price. Especially in warlord-era China, the nation is littered with failed governments who overstretched themselves assailing \"weak\" and \"vulnerable\" factions. Submitting for now and playing the long-game is also an option as well."
china_events.1.a: "We acquiesce to their demands."
china_events.1.b: "We stand defiant!"
china_events.1.c: "We are the legitimate government of China!"

china_events.2.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Submits to Our Authority"
china_events.2.d: "Seeing few potential options to preserve their autonomy and believing us to be their best one, the government of [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to recognise us as the legitimate rulers of China. In doing so they have committed to harmonising their laws with ours, provide troops for our wars, and commit to further coordination in national affairs.\n\nIn return however they have in practice preserved much of their old government, as well as the patronage networks that operate underneath. Warlord troops have always been known to be unwieldy and the warlords themselves untrustworthy. Further integration will have to be discussed another day, for now though the status quo works."
china_events.2.a: "We are magnanimous rulers."

china_events.3.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Yield!"
china_events.3.d: "Despite our efforts to settle the matter peacefully, [FROM.GetLeader] has formally renounced our efforts at promoting national unity and begun mobilising [FROM.GetAdjective] units in a show of force to try and ward us off. [FROM.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] has also ejected all of our representatives and denounced our government as illegitimate, spreading such vile lies throughout [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nNaturally his actions are a grave insult, but our best course of action remains to be seen. Given the stubborn and fickle nature of warlords, rejection was always in the cards. But enforcing our will on [FROM.GetNameDef] will require allocating forces which may be spent elsewhere. Timing, as always, is everything."
china_events.3.a: "Let us begin a buildup at the border."
china_events.3.b: "The invasion begins now!"

china_events.4.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers an Alliance"
china_events.4.d: "Just because we are the only legitimate government of China does not mean we travel alone. There are many sympathetic to our goals throughout the nation, just waiting for liberation. Sometimes, however, they manage to liberate themselves in advance.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] appears to have done just that, rallying the [FROM.GetRulingParty] to free the people of [FROM.GetNameDef]. Aligned with our cause, or at least so they claim, we have officially received their petition to join our cause as a local affiliate."
china_events.4.a: "We graciously accept."
china_events.4.b: "We cannot trust them."

china_events.5.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts our Alliance"
china_events.5.d: "Having heard our petition to align with them, we have been officially accepted into the ranks of [FROM.GetNameDef]. Communications between our officers are being established, and we will work more closely towards national liberation. [FROM.GetLeader] has officially commended [ROOT.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetRulingParty] in a speech at [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for their patriotic efforts, deepening our ties. Although a small victory for us today, history will remember this as a critical step toward the future of China."
china_events.5.a: "Onwards comrades!"

china_events.6.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses an Alliance"
china_events.6.d: "Despite our sincere efforts at national unity, the paranoid clique surrounding [FROM.GetLeader] has decided to reject our efforts at joining their movement, going so far as to denounce us as duplicitous and power-hungry. These unfair accusations only serve to demonstrate their own internal rot, unable to trust outsiders with power.\n\nWe will have to find our own way towards liberation, independent of [FROM.GetAdjective] machinations. In doing so we bear the true legacy of Xinhai, one uncorrupted by the tendrils of [FROM.GetLeader]."
china_events.6.a: "Their cause is not as noble as they say."

china_events.7.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Invites us to Join Ranks"
china_events.7.d: "Even as China grew more and more divided, there were many across the nation that shared a common vision for the future of the nation. These kindred spirits were often divided by mountains and rivers, forced to fight their own regional battles for dominance. Still, it is always a pleasant sight when the stars align and comrades independently take power.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has identified our [ROOT.GetRulingParty] as an ally in their quest to liberate the nation. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been invited to join forces, bringing China ever closer to unification without firing a shot."
china_events.7.a: "We accept wholeheartedly."
china_events.7.b: "We are not affiliated with one another."

china_events.8.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins our Ranks!"
china_events.8.d: "Thanks in part to the similar roots between [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have remained aligned over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to begin coordinating our efforts at unification, peacefully bringing [FROM.GetNameDef] into the [ROOT.GetAdjective] fold.\n\nWith any luck, our combined forces will be sufficient to bring about successful national liberation from the chaos and strife that has engulfed it. With momentum on our side, the combined might of our forces will continue onwards to victory!"
china_events.8.a: "One cause for one nation."

china_events.9.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies our Alliance!"
china_events.9.d: "Despite the similar roots of the [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have diverged over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has denied our efforts at peacefully unifying our cause against mutual enemies, instead electing to go their own route.\n\nThis treason can only be explained by their own selfishness and inability to think beyond their own interests. Whatever the case, it appears that it is up to us to bear the true legacy of Xinhai, and carve a future for all the Chinese people."
china_events.9.a: "[FROM.GetAdjective] traitors ought to at least stay out of our way."

china_events.10.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Attempts to Increase Integration"
china_events.10.d: "It has been a long time coming, but all the same there was some shock within [ROOT.GetLeader]'s inner circle when [FROM.GetNameDef] made their move today. In a private meeting, [FROM.GetLeader] spoke about the future of [ROOT.GetNameDef], and while assuring that [ROOT.GetLeader] will remain governor for the time being, the central government will take steps as necessary to ensure his rule is compatible with the ideals of the [FROM.GetRulingParty].\n\nLeft unspoken is the growing control in which [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has asserted over us, with the expectation that they will have the right to de facto (and possibly even de jure) select a new governor and veto internal appointments. There is really no other choice at this point, either we go down in history as good [FROM.GetRulingParty] soldiers or [ROOT.GetLeader] makes one final desperate stand against their rule. This pivotal moment shall decide the fate of our province henceforth."
china_events.10.a: "We accept [FROM.GetAdjective] rule."
china_events.10.b: "We oppose this encroachment!"

china_events.11.t: "Integration of [ROOT.GetNameDef] Progresses"
china_events.11.d: "We have long enjoyed our autonomy as an independent province, away from the shadow of the central government. Due to the corruption and instability of China's political climate, we have turned away from any notion of centralisation - finding that in this chaotic period of strife; only self-governance would alleviate our own problems. Indeed, for many years we have set about to carry out our own reforms and to reinforce our cultural differences from the rest of the country.\n\nOur home province, while appearing the same on the outside, has experienced significant political, social, and economic shifts since the centralisation of our country. Magistrates and governing bodies are now directly appointed by the central government in [overlord.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. While plenty in the province still speak their provincial dialect fluently, the younger generation of today only speaks in the national dialect. Our economy has also experienced profound changes as the once useful provincial monetary system has collapsed in the wake of adopting the national currency. Furthermore, our provincial forces have all been nationalised, leaving any notion of political independence from the central government gone."
china_events.11.a: "Change comes inevitably."

china_events.12.t: "Our Efforts to Integrate [FROM.GetNameDef]"
china_events.12.d: "Our efforts to integrate the [FROM.GetAdjective] provincial administration with our own has been a complete success. Their people are now content and understanding of our rule, with favourable reports arriving weekly from our appointed magistrates. Furthermore, we hear that their society is now embracing the culture of our capital region and that their schools use our dialect in all forms of dialogue. We do not need to worry about dissent as their local media no longer broadcast with their provincial dialects, and their army is now fully integrated into ours."
china_events.12.a: "One step further in the road to unification."

china_events.13.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Revolts Against Integration"
china_events.13.d: "Warlords are fickle, untrustworthy beasts, always jealously guarding their autonomy despite the costs it imposes on the nation and their people. Although we tried to be as reasonable and subtle as possible during the transition, [FROM.GetLeader] has stubbornly resisted our efforts to bring [FROM.GetNameDef] closer in line with what is expected from our national cause.\n\nHe has instead rallied the [FROM.GetRulingParty] against us, denouncing what he decries as [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] tyranny and efforts to disarm [FROM.GetAdjective] military forces. We must work to quickly quell this rebellion, and with any luck avoid any further damage to our cause."
china_events.13.a: "A small price to pay for national salvation."

china_events.14.t: "[FROM.FROM.GetNameDefCap] Revolts Against [FROM.GetNameDef]"
china_events.14.d: "Shocking news has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as word of a [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] rebellion against the authority of [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] spreads. Discontented at [FROM.GetLeader]'s leadership and fearful of continued encroachment by [FROM.GetRulingParty] agents in local affairs, the [FROM.FROM.GetName] has expelled all [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives in an act of fierce defiance.\n\nThis has thrust [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] into a sudden position of prominence as the leader of what he hopes to be a broader coalition of those who dare to defy [FROM.GetRulingParty] authority. For now we watch from the sidelines as chaos engulfs the fledging [FROM.GetAdjective] government, but it is likely that we will soon be forced to chose as they fight for the future of the movement."
china_events.14.a: "We must hurry to join the uprising!"
china_events.14.b: "Remain loyal to the government."

china_events.15.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Renounces Our Authority"
china_events.15.d: "Perhaps it was inevitable, or perhaps this is an action of brazen selfishness, but regardless the day has come. Inspired by [FROM.FROM.FROM.GetLeader] uprising against our rule, [FROM.GetLeader] has chosen to throw his lot with the rebels. Perhaps incensed by perceived encroachment on their autonomy or maybe discontented by the continued leadership of [ROOT.GetLeader], they have found an opportunity to bring down our government from within. Either we put down these traitors immediately, or the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] dream of national unification will be dead before it could even begin."
china_events.15.a: "There is but one thing a traitor deserves."

china_events.16.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Rebellion"
china_events.16.d: "Seeing an opportunity to break the shackles of [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] oppression, the [FROM.GetRulingParty] has decided to align with us in our effort to topple [FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. [FROM.GetLeader] has sent a telegram formally placing the resources of [FROM.GetNameDef] under our control, though how much this will actually work out in practice remains to be seen. Warlords are fickle creatures, and no doubt they are wondering if we too will take a tyrannical turn.\n\nFor now however, we must focus on defeating the forces of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef]. Our ranks now swelling in number, our chances have grown with it. However, it is unlikely that [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] will go down without a fight, and the revolt continues."
china_events.16.a: "Rebellions are built on hope."

china_events.300.t: "The Return of [QIE.GetNameDef]"
china_events.300.d: "To outside observers, the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 spelled the end of China's centuries-long Manchu-ruled Qing Dynasty. Faced with failure after failure, the Mandate of Heaven, which had ruled the Chinese people for so long, seemed to draw the imperial system to an end finally.\n\nSince the end of the Weltkrieg, the political situation in China has changed dramatically with the Xuantong Restoration. Despite being allied with the Zhili Clique, Chinese royalists have successfully brought the Qing Dynasty to a complete restoration in the past years. Now from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Emperor [ROOT.GetLeader] has officially proclaimed that with China's recent unification, [QIE.GetNameDef] will seek to reassert China's cultural and political superiority in East Asia."
china_events.300.a: "What a turn of events!"

china_events.301.t: "Victory of the Zhili Clique"
china_events.301.d: "Despite having their rule and control of China adequately challenged in the Northern Expedition, the subsequent Xuantong Restoration restored the Qing Empire and saw control of the North solidified by Wu Peifu and the Zhili Clique.\n\nDespite the past years' unrest with the economic collapse of Black Monday and the League War, nonetheless, the Zhili have held on through the storm. While other warlords attempted to split from Zhili control, the Zhili nevertheless have defeated all competing governments, thus unifying China once more. In a glorious speech at [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Wu Peifu has declared that Zhili will seek to modernise China and assert her influence in the world once more."
china_events.301.a: "The North reigns supreme once more."

china_events.302.t: "The Zhili Unify the Chinese Republic"
china_events.302.d: "Despite the success of the Xinhai Revolution, the dream of a Republican China seemed to disintegrate with the Xuantong Restoration. With Puyi restored with the help of the Germans and the Zhili Clique, it appeared to many that the Republican dream was lost.\n\nNonetheless, following a failed coup by the Manchu loyalists during the League Collapse, the Zhili leadership declared the Republic's return. With the re-adoption of the Republican Constitution of 1923 and the recent election of President [ROOT.GetLeader], the Zhili-led Republic seeks to continue on the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. Only time will tell whether or not the Zhili will successfully transition from a warlordist clique to a formal Republic - but their unification of the country shows they are perhaps the most capable of doing so."
china_events.302.a: "A New Era for the Zhili Clique."

china_events.303.t: "Victory of the Fengtian Government"
china_events.303.d: "While nearly defeated in the Third and Fourth Zhi-Feng Wars, the Fengtian Clique's holdout in Manchuria for more than a decade has proven successful. With their recent victory in the Fifth Zhi-Feng War and the subsequent [GetYear] Constitutional Uprising, Marshal [ROOT.GetLeader] has officially declared the proclamation of a unified Republic of China.\n\nDespite their successes on the battlefield and the National Unification Conference, the subsequent battles that the Fengtian Government must deal with - will be to win the hearts and minds of the Chinese people. To many, Marshal [ROOT.GetLeader] is still a warlord, and only time will tell whether or not the Fengtian Government is worthy of being the successor of the Xinhai Revolution."
china_events.303.a: "[FNG.GetLeader] has done it at last."

china_events.304.t: "The Reformed Republic of China is Proclaimed"
china_events.304.d: "Startling news from China today as the Japanese-installed puppet regime has officially proclaimed itself the 'Reformed Republic of China.' Representatives from [JAP.GetNameDef] and Chinese loyalists to the new regime attended a speech by President [ROOT.GetLeader], in which he applauded the unification of China and China's relationship with Japan.\n\nAs part of [JAP.GetNameDef]'s plans for a Pan-Asian Sphere of anti-imperialism, the Reformed Republic of China is a bold experiment to turn China into a fellow ally in Japan's so-called quest to liberate Asia from imperialism. While the new Chinese government's leadership comprises of Chinese officials, there is no doubt that the government answers only to Tokyo."
china_events.304.a: "The Rising Sun rises over China..."

china_events.305.t: "Yan Xishan Declares the Unification of China"
china_events.305.d: "For years, Governor [ROOT.GetLeader] has ruled the isolated and poor province of Shanxi as its warlord - while maintaining a stance of neutrality in the Chinese political arena. Recent developments in China have seen the Shanxi Clique escape its neutrality and emerge to defeat rival government claimants successfully.\n\nNow as the first President of the revived Republic of China, [ROOT.GetLeader] hopes to eventually incorporate his unique ideology domestically into the new Chinese Republic - hoping to bring order to the chaotic Chinese nation. The new President has declared his desire to maintain peace, stability, and neutrality in Asia while also asserting China's strength and sovereignty to the world once more."
china_events.305.a: "President Yan is indeed the man of the hour."

china_events.306.t: "The Guominjun Unification"
china_events.306.d: "After defeat by both the Fengtian and Zhili Cliques, the shattered revolutionary Guominjun retreated to Shanxi province in the late 1920s. There they bid their time, and after a power struggle with the province's governor Yan Xishan, they emerged from the province to successfully unify the Chinese nation under [ROOT.GetLeader]'s ecstatic revolutionary ideology.\n\nNow as the first President in the revived Republic of China, President [ROOT.GetLeader] has declared that the new Republic will serve as the forefront of a new revolution in China. Led by the former Guominjun, the new Chinese government has announced that it will be the vanguard of a new revolution of anti-imperialist liberation, no doubt shaking the old order of Asia drastically."
china_events.306.a: "The Guominjun Revolution has arrived in China."

china_events.307.t: "China under the Yiguandao"
china_events.307.d: "A dramatic development has occurred in China with the proclamation of national reunification under the religious leader [ROOT.GetLeader] and his Yiguandao sect of millenarian populists. After defeating all competing governments on the battlefield, the new supreme leader of China has dedicated his unification in his speech to the 'Eternal Venerable Mother' to a massive crowd in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThe new regime has declared China's isolation from world affairs, and many (both foreigners and Chinese) are expected to leave the country soon in fear. The near-future of the Chinese nation looks bleak as the cult begins its process of converting the Chinese peoples to its esoteric ideology."
china_events.307.a: "A new age for China dawns."

china_events.308.t: "Proclamation of the Republic of China"
china_events.308.d: "With large swathes of territorial acquisitions made by the KMT a ceremony has taken place in the Nanjing Presidential Palace, Chairman [ROOT.GetLeader] officially proclaimed the creation of a second National Republic of China. The site of the proclamation, just inside the palace's Main Hall, is where Dr. Sun Yat-sen was declared provisional president of the first Chinese Republic in 1912. Though the Nationalists have already secured their position in China, this was only as an unrecognised insurgency led by their military forces.\n\nThe Nationalist Government aims to establish a single-party socialist state led by the Kuomintang that will eliminate the chaos plaguing China and allow for a just and democratic civil society to safely form under their tutelage."
china_events.308.a: "Dr. Sun's dream for a Revolutionary China, carries on!"

china_events.309.d: "News from China has been chaotic recently, as rapid warfare for control over China seems to be coming to a close. The right wing of the Kuomintang under [FROM.GetLeader] has achieved supremacy throughout China, and has declared the unification of the Republic of China under the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun and Wholly Red Earth.\n\nFollowing in the ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Generalissimo [FROM.GetLeader] has promised the Chinese people and the world that this is a new era for China, promising to reverse the humiliation of European powers and the guiding of the nation to greatness. Only time shall tell what the Kuomintang shall achieve."

china_events.310.t: "Proclamation of the United Provinces of China"
china_events.310.d: "With China largely under the control of Chen Jiongming's National Defence Army, a new Republic has been proclaimed in Beijing as Federalist troops parade through Tiananmen Square. The United Provinces of China, as often called in the West, has completely replaced the previous internationally-recognised Chinese government and with their power secured, it is only a matter of time before the international community recognises it.\n\nThe Federalist Government intends to organise a \"National Conference\" consisting of deputies from all liberated provinces to draft a new constitution and form an official provisional government until national elections can be called at the earliest convenience."

china_events.311.t: "The Zhili Unify China Against the Odds"
china_events.311.d: "Since the Northern Expedition, there has been no greater crisis for the Zhili Clique than the successful coup of Manchu loyalists - that saw the deaths of Cao Cun and Wu Peifu. Driven out of Zhili Province in the coup's aftermath, the remnants of the Zhili Clique fled for their aligned province of Sichuan - where they declared a rival government to the Manchu Government.\n\nEmerging out of the famine-stricken province, the Zhili defeated all competing national governments and returned home to their native province by victory of arms. With the Manchu threat finally defeated, [ROOT.GetLeader] has declared that under the Zhili Clique, the Republic of China is hereafter to be revived. Only time will tell whether the Zhili will succeed in their new battle to win the hearts of the masses."

china_events.312.d: "To many in China, the Federalist movement seemed destined for failure as the Federalist movement has been expelled twice now in recent history from their home province of Guangzhou. Driven once more into exile, Chen Jiongming found a haven under the Sichuanese provincial government.\n\nFrom Sichuan, the Federalists have managed to defeat all competing and rival governments successfully. Their rule solidified, the Federalists have officially proclaimed the first year of the United Provinces of China under the leadership of the Zhi-Gong Party. The new government intends to organise a \"National Conference\" consisting of deputies from all provinces to draft a new constitution prepare the nation for elections."

china_events.313.d: "The poor western province of Sichuan is known for its competing warlord factions and cliques, tearing the province apart in a civil war before a deadly famine consumed it. In this chaotic period of Sichuanese politics, General Liu Xiang of the Industrial Corps managed to outmanoeuvre his opponents and unify his province under his leadership.\n\nDenouncing the leadership of the Central Government, the General took the province of Sichuan on a path of war, with his provincial army waging war and defeating rival competing governments. With his recent victories and crushing of dissenters, he has declared himself the President of a revived Republic of China. Only time will tell whether or not the General's regime and legacy will be lasting."

china_events.314.d: "In the era of constant warfare and strife in the ever-changing political landscape, it is not surprising to see smaller cliques and provinces move beyond their borders to seek power and glory. Surprising many, [FROM.GetNameDef] has emerged out of their province to defeat rival competing governments and has proclaimed the Republic of China from their capital of [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThe country of China long divided, has finally been reunified once more under the leadership of [ROOT.GetLeader]. Only time will tell whether or not China will catch up to the rest of the world, but for now, the Chinese people can finally rest, knowing that the chaotic Warlord Period has come to an end."

china_events.340.d: "Despite leading the Kuomintang from exile and near destruction to resounding national successes with the completion of the Second Northern Expedition, Chairman [CHI.GetLeader]'s rule seemed to fall apart with the growing factional opposition from the Kuomintang's Provisional Action Committee. Despite attacks on all sides however, it appears that the Chairman has indeed solidified his control and rule of the Party, effectively crushing the opposition.\n\nNow, for the first time in decades, peace has finally returned to China and Chairman Wang will seek to modernise and revive the Chinese country in order to fulfil the principles outlined by his mentor, the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen for years to come."

china_events.341.d: "While the Kuomintang was nominally led by Wang Jingwei during the party's exile period following the Northern Expedition, those who remained in China organised themselves as the autonomous MinGan Insurgency government. This was the foundation on which the Provisional Action Committee (PAC) of the Kuomintang was formed, and in their 1932 Declaration to the Revolutionary People in China and the World they announced a populist, socialist platform seemingly closer to the people.\n\nYears later, Chairwoman [CHI.GetLeader] has declared that transition of the PAC into a new Revolutionary Committee to lead the common masses towards the eradication of class and towards a new revolutionary future for the peasants and workers of China.

The party then splintered into multiple factions as the country once again collapsed into another great civil war.\n\nIt would appear that from his government in Beiping, Chairman Zeng Zhongming and Premier Chen Gongbo along with the Reorganised Comrades Association have proclaimed victory against all the other factions. Now that the Reorganisation Faction maintains total control of both the country and the Party, foreign observers believe that China will head towards an authoritarian socialist future one driven by some of China's most radical socialists."

The great families of Ma now rule these lands without question as our armies march from Hami to Beijing, but despite all our past successes, what our future shall be is left to be decided. The main idea is to keep true to our republican history, moving to create a new Republic of China. However, our forces are split on whether we should embrace the ideals of the original Republic of China and the Xinhai Revolution, or should we blaze a new path towards republicanism under the guiding light of Allah. Distancing from these republican ideals, we could always keep our past deals with the Qing as well, and move to make a compromise with the Aisin-Gioro Clan. By casting down the fool Puyi, we could crown his cousin and devout Muslim Prince Pugong as the new Dragon Emperor of the Qing. Though this new nation would still largely function as the Qing once did, this restored dynasty would be one far more friendly to their new Hui saviors. Alternatively, we could keep these dynastic aspirations but betray the Qing fully, moving to crown one of our own as a new emperor of a new dynasty, though such an outlandish move would be reviled by most of China. Whatever we choose, China is ours. Now we just have to decide on our shared destiny."
mac.20000.a: "Proclaim a new Islamic republic free from the mistakes of the past."
mac.20000.b: "Embrace the ideals of Xinhai and the First Republic in a new form."
mac.20000.c: "By the grace of Allah and the Mandate of Heaven, proclaim the Hui Dynasty."
mac.20000.e: "Keep our word to the Qing and crown Pugong as the new Emperor."

mac.20001.t: "Crowning a Ma"
mac.20001.d: "With our wild and outlandish decision to declare a new Muslim dynasty of China, all that remains before we can take this imperial journey is to pick our new monarch. Though the first of the three (or five, depending on who you ask) has largely been subjugated and made irrelevant, the second and third Ma families, along with their extra two cousin branches, all hold many proud and honored heroes of the Ma Clique that would surely make a fitting leader for our new Hui Dynasty. Who shall be chosen to lead this new China under Allah and the Dragon Throne?"
mac.20001.a: "Ma Hongbin, the proud Chairman of Gansu, is crowned."
mac.20001.b: "Ma Hongkui, the great Socialist Slayer, is crowned."
mac.20001.c: "Ma Bufang, the civic genius and man of the people, is crowned."
mac.20001.e: "Ma Lin, patron of the Yihewani and devout Muslim, is crowned."
mac.20001.f: "Ma Buqing, the tactical genius and star general, is crowned."
mac.20001.g: "Ma Hushan, slayer of Russians and lord of Tunganistan, is crowned."
mac.20001.h: "Ma Zhongying, once named Buying and now a violent outcast, is crowned."
mac.20001.i: "Ma Fuxiang, somehow still alive, is crowned as emperor."

mac.20002.t: "A New Hierarchy"
mac.20002.d: "With [root.getleader] rising to lead all of China, the Ma families have been hard at work spreading their influence and control across these vast lands. Many prestigious and prominent members of the former Ma Clique have been given positions as governors or lords over swathes of land as new internal divisions and civic systems are organized. For example, despite their other duties, Ma Bufang has been made the lord of the Khyber Pass while Ma Hongkui now lords over Dzungaria. Ma Zhanshan rides across the lands of the Mongols as Ma Jiyuan handles Manchuria and Ma Shaowu deals with the local Korean diaspora. Ma Zhongying, once disgraced, has now been entrusted to govern the isles and archipelagoes of the South and East China Seas as Ma Hongbin climbs to the ceiling of the world to lord over the Himalayas. All across the fringes of our empire, loyal members of the main Ma families take their place under [root.getleader] as we build a new Islamic paradise under Allah and the Ma families."
mac.20002.a: "Alhamdulillah!"

### National Redoubt

china_redoubt.1.d: "One by one our defences in the East have crumbled before the enemy's advance, our armies put to flight alongside the desperate refugees now packing the roads and railways leading westward. Even now further Japanese troops pour onto the North China Plain, and the time has come for the government to consider retreat. Fortunately China is vast, and the creation of a national redoubt may let us ride out the oncoming storm. The government has already begun preparations to flee to [china_national_redoubt.GetCliqueShortName], and its offices are filled with frantic activity. But, outside, the streets of the provisional capital are filled with a dead air and sombre air, roamed only by those poor souls too wretched to flee westward. Until the enemy is defeated, there can be no looking back."

 china_northern_school_desc: "§LChina's northern warlords mostly hail from the Xuantong-era military schools at Baoding and Tianjin and represent the cream of an increasingly old crop of officers. Educated in the Prussian style and fighting mainly on the northern plain, their style of command emphasises positional warfare alongside the importance of well-drilled troops; especially the artillery.§!"

 KR_southern_school: "Mass and Mobility"
 china_southern_school_desc: "§LLacking the resources of the northern warlords and fighting mainly in the tumbling mountains and valleys of the south, China's southern warlords emphasise numbers and manoeuvre warfare. Aggression is rewarded, openings are always to be exploited, and heavy artillery is replaced by swift mountain guns.§!"

 KR_green_forest_school: "Resilience and Requisition"
 china_green_forest_school_desc: "§LSome of China's warlords have no military schooling whatsoever and instead refer to themselves as having attended the 'university of the green forest'. Yet, for all their shortcomings, these former (and sometimes active) bandits bring a unique approach to warfare, able to remain flexible and resilient in even the most trying circumstances. Some may call their methods crude or even criminal, but they often get results.§!"

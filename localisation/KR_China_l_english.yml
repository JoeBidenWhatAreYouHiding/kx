Equipment is regularly patchwork, obsolete, or even downright archaic. Loyalty is typically given to individual officers, or a regularly filled ricebowl, and ideological motivation is ephemeral at best. It will take a great deal to rebuild these armies along modern lines.\n"

china_shared.1.t: "Fading Legitimacy"
china_shared.1.d: "The United Front may have brought a measure of unity to our fractured country, but the internal conflicts between Chinese factions never truly ended. Now, our losses in the face of the Japanese invasion have forced our government to recognize a simple truth: we can no longer claim to be China's leader in the face of foreign invasion. Already forces under various warlords and regional governments have begun routinely ignoring our directives in favor of those from [current_china_leader.GetNameDef]. Unless we push forward and retake our lost territory we stand to permanently lose our leadership status."
china_shared.1.a: "Drat."

china_shared.2.t: "A United Front"
china_shared.2.d: "With Japan's invasion beginning to gather steam, [Root.GetLeader] has decided to make a call for national unity against the invader, even if it means fighting alongside our former enemies. Even as the country's communication infrastructure has come under threat, the message will go out at once - by courier if necessary!"
china_shared.2.a: "For China!"

china_shared.3.t: "A Call For Unity"
china_shared.3.d: "Scholars, intellectuals, and various idealogues have made calls for national unity against foreign aggression routinely over the years. It has been a nice rallying cry, if one that often fell on deaf ears. Now, with Japan's invasion rolling across a significant portion of the country,[From.GetNameDef] has made a call for a temporary alliance against Japan, and this time perhaps other leaders will listen. Even the most cynical must admit that China's fate seems to hang in the balance."
china_shared.3.a: "Yes, we must band together."
china_shared.3.b: "We shall never fight alongside them!"

china_shared.4.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the United Front"
china_shared.4.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has joined the United Front, pledging all their resources and influence to the anti-Japanese cause. This will not bring an end to any historical rivalries, or claims to legitimate national leadership, but nontheless our troops will now be fighting side by side against the foreign aggressor."
china_shared.4.a: "Excellent."

china_shared.5.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Betrayal"
china_shared.5.d: "In an act of wanton betrayal, [From.GetNameDef] has refused to join the United Front. There can be no excuse for putting individual interests before the fate of all China!"
china_shared.5.a: "Traitors!"

china_shared.6.t: "[current_china_leader.GetNameDefCap] Offers a Ceasefire"
china_shared.6.d: "With [From.GetNameDef] joining the United Front, [current_china_leader.GetNameDef], has offered to broker a ceasefire between [From.GetNameDef] and our regime, solely in the national interest, until such a time as the Japanese invasion is halted. The agreement is conditional on the transfer of all occupied territories on both of our sides, however."
china_shared.6.a: "Yes. For now."
china_shared.6.b: "We shall never fight alongside them!"

china_shared.7.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Ceasefire"

china_shared.8.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused the offered ceasefire."
china_shared.8.a: "Traitors!"

china_shared.9.t: "Formation of the United Front"
china_shared.9.d: "Ever since the Japanese invasion cries have gone up across the country for a united front against Japanese aggression, and now they have been heard. Today marks the formation of the United Front, dedicated to the expulsion of the Japanese and their influence from our Chinese soil. Now our fates are tied as one, and there can be only victory or anhiliation."
china_shared.9.a: "The Japanese must be defeated."

china_shared.10.t: "The United Front Fails"
china_shared.10.d: "It seems that not even an existential threat will unite the squabbling Chinese factions. After a month of negotiations and calls for aid, no other factions proved willing to put their differences with our regime aside - not even to stop the Japanese invasion. Our fate, apparently, is to fall divided."
china_shared.10.a: "This is a dark day..."

china_shared.11.t: "Collapse of the United Front"
china_shared.11.d: "Even as the war with Japan began to move toward its close, many in China were already making covert moves toward one side or another in the post-war order. With Japan now defeated, those suppressed conflicts have again come to the fore, and what was one a united front has began a rapid slide into infighting. Now the final phase of China's unification wars has begun."
china_shared.11.a: "One last obstacle towards unification."

china_shared.12.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the United Front"
china_shared.12.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has left the United Front, decrying the alliance as now 'unnecessary' and 'limiting' to their needs and ambitions."
china_shared.12.a: "So much for unity."

china_shared.13.t: "The United Front Forms"
china_shared.13.d.pro_JAP: "It seems some of our fellow Chinese, unwilling to acknowledge our latest string of victories, have deicded to band together against us and our Japanese allies. While Tokyo is already considering this last-ditch alliance insignificant, we know China better than they ever could, and that a long fight still awaits ahead." #Pro-Japan Chinese POV
china_shared.13.d.anti_JAP: "After a string of secret meetings carried out over several weeks, several Chinese political factions including our own have agreed to stand together against the oncoming Japanese invasion. Unity has been elusive for decades, but now with the formation of the Chinese United Front the country finally stands a chance at repelling the Japanese invader, and crushing his traitorus allies." #Anti-Japan Chinese POV
china_shared.13.d.JAP: "It seems that several Chinese factions, unwilling to acknowledge our latest string of victories and the overwhelming superiority of our armies, have deicded to band together against us. It is difficult to imagine the squabbling, cliquish Chinese truly working together toward a common cause, and our commanders have assured us that theirs is ultimately a futile measure. We will be sipping Sake amid the ruins of their headquarters by the end of the year." #Japanese POV
china_shared.13.d.others: "It seems that the Chinese, in their desperation to slow the Japanese invasion of their country, have formed an alliance. Few expected the typically squabbling, cliquish Chinese factions to make such a move, and now many will watch their future with considerable interest." #Foreign POV
china_shared.13.a: "Onward."
china_shared.13.b: "Wansui!"
china_shared.13.c: "Banzai!"
china_shared.13.e: "Interesting."

china_shared.14.t: "Collapse of the United Front"
china_shared.14.d.CHI: "In retrospect, the collapse of the United Front appears to have been inevitable. As a fish cannot leave the water, nor could the Front survive devoid of desperation. However, for some time, the whole of China was united behind a single purpose, marching in step toward a shared goal. Even as the dark clouds of civil war loom, there is now a shining example of what could be, and perhaps what will be, once again." #Chinese POV
china_shared.14.d.JAP: "It seems that the Chinese United Front, always beset by internal squabbling, has finally collapsed in the absence of our once overwhelming military might. Amid these days of reflection on what we might have been, an indomitable giant standing astride all of Asia, here is further proof of the dangers of western imperialism. We may have been defeated by China, but at least we remain united as one nation, beneath His Majesty the Emperor. Our destiny is still our own." #Japanese POV
china_shared.14.d.others: "The Chinese United Front, always beset by internal partisan squabbling, has finally dissolved in the absence of Japan's once overwhelming threat to its independence. The whole nation now seems set to plunge again into the fires of civil war which have consumed it, almost uninterrupted, for a generation. For many in the coastal cities and outside China this is hardly unexpected news, as the nation's tumults have  been regulars on broadsheet pages, but many experts will be paying close attention over the next several months. This round of conflict may well be China's last, as the playing-field has narrowed considerably." #Foreign POV

china_shared.1000.t: "The Heirloom Seal of the Realm"
china_shared.1000.d: "The Heirloom Seal of the Realm is a long-lost Imperial artifact that once served as the official seal and stamp of approval of the Emperors of China. Crafted by the first Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang after consolidating the Qin Dynasty, the stamp was carved from the Heshibi - a famous and beautifully ornate jade bi, or ceremonial disc, that once belonged to the leaders of the Zhao state. The stamp, made of jade which symbolized Chinese regality and the inner beauty of humanity, was inscribed with the motto ‘Having received the Mandate of Heaven, may the Emperor lead a long and prosperous life’, and served as the official stamp of the office of the Emperor of centuries. \n\nHowever, the original Heirloom Seal was tragically lost during Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period during the 10th Century, and since then, every dynasty has tried to find it, for the stamp has come to represent the physical embodiment of the Mandate of Heaven. So desperate to find this heirloom, the Qing Dynasty of the Manchus produced hundreds of forgeries and fakes in order to depreciate the value of the original while also making it much harder to find, or if found, verified. Now that our Dynasty controls China, we must begin the search for this impossible-to-find artifact, while also producing our own fakes along the way, for whoever holds the one, true stamp has a claim to the Chinese throne."

Dissatisfied with our government, [FROM.GetLeader] has formally denounced us before a crowd in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Since then, more and more units have amassed along the border. Small skirmishes have already begun as our opponents make probing attacks and tensions spike. We must hurry to our defence, lest we be crushed under the weight of our foes."
china_events.0.d.ally_of_target: "We have received a warning from our allies in [FROM.GetName] that an invasion from [FROM.FROM.GetName] is on the horizon. Both sides have already begun preparation for such a conflict as the border grows increasingly tense. Given our prior obligations to [FROM.GetName], we will likely be drawn into this conflict. We must begin scrambling troops of our own immediately - let us hope that our decision to ally with the [FROM.GetAdjective] was not made too hastily."
china_events.0.a: "Assemble the general staff!"

china_events.1.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Submission"
china_events.1.d: "Confident in their growing strength or perhaps merely seeking to project it in these times of troubles, we have received a series of demands from [FROM.GetLeader]'s government demanding our immediate recognition of their authority. This would naturally entail the stationing of troops, adhering to their decrees and likely further tributes that would naturally be sent to a national government.\n\nCalling their bluff of course, is always an option. It will likely mean war, though freedom from tyranny often requires such a price. Especially in warlord-era China, the nation is littered with failed governments who overstretched themselves assailing \"weak\" and \"vulnerable\" factions. Submitting for now and playing the long-game is also an option as well."
china_events.1.a: "We acquiesce to their demands."
china_events.1.b: "We stand defiant!"
china_events.1.c: "We are the legitimate government of China!"

china_events.2.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Submits to Our Authority"
china_events.2.d: "Seeing few potential options to preserve their autonomy and believing us to be their best one, the government of [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to recognise us as the legitimate rulers of China. In doing so they have committed to harmonising their laws with ours, provide troops for our wars, and commit to further coordination in national affairs.\n\nIn return however they have in practice preserved much of their old government, as well as the patronage networks that operate underneath. Warlord troops have always been known to be unwieldy and the warlords themselves untrustworthy. Further integration will have to be discussed another day, for now though the status quo works."
china_events.2.a: "We are magnanimous rulers."

china_events.3.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Yield!"
china_events.3.d: "Despite our efforts to settle the matter peacefully, [FROM.GetLeader] has formally renounced our efforts at promoting national unity and begun mobilising [FROM.GetAdjective] units in a show of force to try and ward us off. [FROM.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] has also ejected all of our representatives and denounced our government as illegitimate, spreading such vile lies throughout [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nNaturally his actions are a grave insult, but our best course of action remains to be seen. Given the stubborn and fickle nature of warlords, rejection was always in the cards. But enforcing our will on [FROM.GetNameDef] will require allocating forces which may be spent elsewhere. Timing, as always, is everything."
china_events.3.a: "Let us begin a buildup at the border."
china_events.3.b: "The invasion begins now!"

china_events.4.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers an Alliance"
china_events.4.d: "Just because we are the only legitimate government of China does not mean we travel alone. There are many sympathetic to our goals throughout the nation, just waiting for liberation. Sometimes, however, they manage to liberate themselves in advance.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] appears to have done just that, rallying the [FROM.GetRulingParty] to free the people of [FROM.GetNameDef]. Aligned with our cause, or at least so they claim, we have officially received their petition to join our cause as a local affiliate."
china_events.4.a: "We graciously accept."

china_events.5.d: "Having heard our petition to align with them, we have been officially accepted into the ranks of [FROM.GetNameDef]. Communications between our officers are being established, and we will work more closely towards national liberation. [FROM.GetLeader] has officially commended [ROOT.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetRulingParty] in a speech at [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for their patriotic efforts, deepening our ties. Although a small victory for us today, history will remember this as a critical step toward the future of China."
china_events.5.a: "Onwards comrades!"

china_events.6.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses an Alliance"
china_events.6.d: "Despite our sincere efforts at national unity, the paranoid clique surrounding [FROM.GetLeader] has decided to reject our efforts at joining their movement, going so far as to denounce us as duplicitous and power-hungry. These unfair accusations only serve to demonstrate their own internal rot, unable to trust outsiders with power.\n\nWe will have to find our own way towards liberation, independent of [FROM.GetAdjective] machinations. In doing so we bear the true legacy of Xinhai, one uncorrupted by the tendrils of [FROM.GetLeader]."
china_events.6.a: "Their cause is not as noble as they say."

china_events.7.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Invites us to Join Ranks"
china_events.7.d: "Even as China grew more and more divided, there were many across the nation that shared a common vision for the future of the nation. These kindred spirits were often divided by mountains and rivers, forced to fight their own regional battles for dominance. Still, it is always a pleasant sight when the stars align and comrades independently take power.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has identified our [ROOT.GetRulingParty] as an ally in their quest to liberate the nation. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been invited to join forces, bringing China ever closer to unification without firing a shot."
china_events.7.a: "We accept wholeheartedly."
china_events.7.b: "We are not affiliated with one another."

china_events.8.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins Our Ranks!"
china_events.8.d: "Thanks in part to the similar roots between [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have remained aligned over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to begin coordinating our efforts at unification, peacefully bringing [FROM.GetNameDef] into the [ROOT.GetAdjective] fold.\n\nWith any luck, our combined forces will be sufficient to bring about successful national liberation from the chaos and strife that has engulfed it. With momentum on our side, the combined might of our forces will continue onwards to victory!"
china_events.8.a: "One cause for one nation."

china_events.9.d: "Despite the similar roots of the [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have diverged over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has denied our efforts at peacefully unifying our cause against mutual enemies, instead electing to go their own route.\n\nThis treason can only be explained by their own selfishness and inability to think beyond their own interests. Whatever the case, it appears that it is up to us to bear the true legacy of Xinhai, and carve a future for all the Chinese people."
china_events.9.a: "[FROM.GetAdjective] traitors ought to at least stay out of our way."

china_events.10.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Attempts to Increase Integration"
china_events.10.d: "It has been a long time coming, but all the same there was some shock within [ROOT.GetLeader]'s inner circle when [FROM.GetNameDef] made their move today. In a private meeting, [FROM.GetLeader] spoke about the future of [ROOT.GetNameDef], and while assuring that [ROOT.GetLeader] will remain governor for the time being, the central government will take steps as necessary to ensure his rule is compatible with the ideals of the [FROM.GetRulingParty].\n\nLeft unspoken is the growing control in which [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has asserted over us, with the expectation that they will have the right to de facto (and possibly even de jure) select a new governor and veto internal appointments. There is really no other choice at this point, either we go down in history as good [FROM.GetRulingParty] soldiers or [ROOT.GetLeader] makes one final desperate stand against their rule. This pivotal moment shall decide the fate of our province henceforth."
china_events.10.a: "We accept [FROM.GetAdjective] rule."
china_events.10.b: "We oppose this encroachment!"

china_events.11.t: "Integration of [ROOT.GetNameDef] Progresses"
china_events.11.d: "We have long enjoyed our autonomy as an independent province, away from the shadow of the central government. Due to the corruption and instability of China's political climate, we have turned away from any notion of centralisation - finding that in this chaotic period of strife; only self-governance would alleviate our own problems. Indeed, for many years we have set about to carry out our own reforms and to reinforce our cultural differences from the rest of the country.\n\nOur home province, while appearing the same on the outside, has experienced significant political, social, and economic shifts since the centralisation of our country. Magistrates and governing bodies are now directly appointed by the central government in [overlord.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. While plenty in the province still speak their provincial dialect fluently, the younger generation of today only speaks in the national dialect. Our economy has also experienced profound changes as the once useful provincial monetary system has collapsed in the wake of adopting the national currency. Furthermore, our provincial forces have all been nationalised, leaving any notion of political independence from the central government gone."
china_events.11.a: "Change comes inevitably."

china_events.12.t: "Our Efforts to Integrate [FROM.GetNameDef]"
china_events.12.d: "Our efforts to integrate the [FROM.GetAdjective] provincial administration with our own has been a complete success. Their people are now content and understanding of our rule, with favourable reports arriving weekly from our appointed magistrates. Furthermore, we hear that their society is now embracing the culture of our capital region and that their schools use our dialect in all forms of dialogue. We do not need to worry about dissent as their local media no longer broadcast with their provincial dialects, and their army is now fully integrated into ours."
china_events.12.a: "One step further in the road to unification."

china_events.13.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Revolts Against Integration"
china_events.13.d: "Warlords are fickle, untrustworthy beasts, always jealously guarding their autonomy despite the costs it imposes on the nation and their people. Although we tried to be as reasonable and subtle as possible during the transition, [FROM.GetLeader] has stubbornly resisted our efforts to bring [FROM.GetNameDef] closer in line with what is expected from our national cause.\n\nHe has instead rallied the [FROM.GetRulingParty] against us, denouncing what he decries as [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] tyranny and efforts to disarm [FROM.GetAdjective] military forces. We must work to quickly quell this rebellion, and with any luck avoid any further damage to our cause."
china_events.13.a: "A small price to pay for national salvation."

china_events.14.t: "[FROM.FROM.GetNameDefCap] Revolts Against [FROM.GetNameDef]"
china_events.14.d: "Shocking news has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as word of a [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] rebellion against the authority of [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] spreads. Discontented at [FROM.GetLeader]'s leadership and fearful of continued encroachment by [FROM.GetRulingParty] agents in local affairs, the [FROM.FROM.GetName] has expelled all [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives in an act of fierce defiance.\n\nThis has thrust [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] into a sudden position of prominence as the leader of what he hopes to be a broader coalition of those who dare to defy [FROM.GetRulingParty] authority. For now we watch from the sidelines as chaos engulfs the fledging [FROM.GetAdjective] government, but it is likely that we will soon be forced to chose as they fight for the future of the movement."
china_events.14.a: "We must hurry to join the uprising!"
china_events.14.b: "Remain loyal to the government."

china_events.15.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Renounces Our Authority"
china_events.15.d: "Perhaps it was inevitable, or perhaps this is an action of brazen selfishness, but regardless the day has come. Inspired by [FROM.FROM.FROM.GetLeader] uprising against our rule, [FROM.GetLeader] has chosen to throw his lot with the rebels. Perhaps incensed by perceived encroachment on their autonomy or maybe discontented by the continued leadership of [ROOT.GetLeader], they have found an opportunity to bring down our government from within. Either we put down these traitors immediately, or the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] dream of national unification will be dead before it could even begin."
china_events.15.a: "There is but one thing a traitor deserves."

china_events.16.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Rebellion"
china_events.16.d: "Seeing an opportunity to break the shackles of [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] oppression, the [FROM.GetRulingParty] has decided to align with us in our effort to topple [FROM.FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. [FROM.GetLeader] has sent a telegram formally placing the resources of [FROM.GetNameDef] under our control, though how much this will actually work out in practice remains to be seen. Warlords are fickle creatures, and no doubt they are wondering if we too will take a tyrannical turn.\n\nFor now however, we must focus on defeating the forces of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef]. Our ranks now swelling in number, our chances have grown with it. However, it is unlikely that [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] will go down without a fight, and the revolt continues."

Such fears finally came true today, with many governors rebelling against [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThe two sides have been trading claims of tyranny, with the rebels denouncing the central government as betraying federalist principles while the [FROM.GetRulingParty] insist that they are trying to democratise regionalist oligarchies. War is imminent, and if the Federalist ideal is to survive, their armies must move quickly."
china_central_plains_war_desc_lkmt: "Frantic news from China has arrived that the country has seemingly fallen into another civil war. While they once proclaimed loyalty to the Kuomintang's National Government, rebellious warlords have announced their decision to cut off ties with the [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Government - denouncing the Kuomintang's apparent authoritarianism.\n\nWhile some may consider that the Kuomintang's idea of a unitary state has led to an inevitable civil war, there can be no doubt that the NRA must act quickly in dispelling the rebels, or else the Kuomintang may very well lose their chance once more to fulfil Dr. Sun's revolution."
china_central_plains_war_desc_rkmt: "After being repeatedly ousted by his rivals, Dr. Sun Yat-sen formed the Kuomintang along vanguardist lines, demanding personal loyalty oaths from each member. Despite this, the Kuomintang have long struggled to present a united front, even before their eternal Premier's death. The Kuomintang's rightist elements have attempted to build a unified coalition, only to see it collapse in recent days.\n\nThe central government, led by [FROM.GetLeader] has denounced the growing rebellion as the work of \"bandits\" in hopes of delegitimising the growing discontent at his authoritarian rule.

[FROM.GetNameDefCap]'s attempt to pick up the pieces took a severe blow today with news of a major uprising by various regional governments.\n\nReminiscent of the National Protection War, the rebels claim to be liberating the nation from Zhili tyranny. Whether or not this is merely a front for warlord rule, and if the Zhili whether yet another storm, will be determined on the battlefield."
china_central_plains_war_desc_manchu: "Installed in an effort to achieve international legitimacy, the Qing monarchy has not been particularly popular even after the ouster of the Zhili. Their efforts to assert control over allied factions, has triggered a new National Protection War, with rebels stoking republican sentiment against what they argue is a foreign imposed monarchy.\n\nThe [FROM.GetAdjective] leadership in turn have vowed to quash the rebellion in a national pacification campaign: the outcome will determine the fate of the troubled history of the Qing dynasty."

Although [FROM.GetLeader] has successfully secured the loyalty of various regional governments through negotiations, it appears those agreements fell through today as greater integration was sought.\n\nWith multiple regions now in open rebellion, [FROM.GetAdjective] legitimacy is now in question. Propaganda, true or not, about [FROM.GetAdjective] cooperation with the Japanese and other sordid rumours have begun to spread.

If we press to continue protecting our allies, we will be forced to sacrifice our ties with [FROM.GetFactionName], leaving us ourselves vulnerable.

The Chinese could simply walk into any of our concessions virtually unopposed, leaving us with the unenviable task of recovering them, and then subduing the Chinese nation as a whole.

With Shanghai in particular offering resistance, the cities will quickly fall into chaos, as foreigners pile onto ships, others barricade their homes, and men take up arms as part of various volunteer forces.

 china_events.227.d: "We have received word from Shanghai that the Chinese, now united under a single government for the first time in decades, wish to re-negotiate the status of the Legation Cities. Put plainly, they are demanding the immediate return of all concessions in China. The matter has been passed to the Legation Council, and whatever choice the council ultimately makes will be binding.\n\nMany intellectuals would argue that the Legation Cities are echoes of a bygone age, but there are few places in the world as profitable as Shanghai, or as strategically important. Our generals point out the difficulty in holding such a small set of territories against a country as large as China, with its vast reserves of manpower, but gunboat diplomacy has yet to meet its match.\n\n The Legation Cities may attempt to defend themselves, in one way or another, but should the council vote to defend the mandate we must be prepared to do so to the hilt. Military defeat by a second-rate power like China would be unacceptable. With some luck, the Chinese will back down in the face of overwhelming force, but otherwise war seems inevitable.\n\nOur ambassador in [china.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] awaits the government's decision."

Plans are likely already being drawn for a pompous march down the Bund, and the raising of a Chinese flag above Shanghai for the first time in a century. With no foreign intervention set to change our fate, there is now little to do now but see to an orderly transfer of power, insofar as one can be arranged. Then we must pack our bags, say our goodbyes, and sail on into the sunset."

Even now, foreign fleets should be mustering to our defence, but until they arrive it will be up to our municipal authorities, volunteer forces, and foreign garrisons, to hold the line.

The party then splintered into multiple factions as the country once again collapsed into another great civil war.\n\nIt would appear that from his government in Beiping, Chairman Zeng Zhongming and Premier Chen Gongbo along with the Reorganised Comrades Association have proclaimed victory against all the other factions. Now that the Reorganisation Faction maintains total control of both the country and the Party, foreign observers believe that China will head towards an authoritarian socialist future one driven by some of China's most radical socialists."
china_events.342.a: "A New China has arisen..."

china_events.343.t: "The China Revival Society Declare Victory"
china_events.343.d: "While the Kuomintang succeeded in unifying the country under their party flag, the Party descended into civil war following the assassination and death of its former Chairman, Wang Jingwei. As squabbling factional forces began to fight one another, the radical China Revival Society managed to seize power and secure the country in a state of an emergency.\n\nIn a grand speech from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Generalissmo Hu Zongnan has declared that all enemies of China both internal and domestic shall be crushed under a new direction of the national revolution. The CRS' talk of a totalitarian revolution inspired by the likes of Savinkov, Mussolini, and Mosley shall surely dim a light on any chances of democracy in China."
china_events.343.a: "Darkness has befallen the National Revolution."

china_events.241.t:0 "Legation's End?"
china_events.241.d:0 "Now that our soldiers have successfully occupied the Legation Cities, we are in a position to negotiate a beneficial peace with the powers backing it. Although talks of a possible ceasefire would seem like the obvious option, some within our command are convinced that the forces which have foolishly chosen to support the collapsing colonial entity have been severely weakened, and they are confident that our armies are more than capable enough to take out the entire alliance. Should we call for peace or shall we continue the fight?"
china_events.241.a:0 "Let us end the bloodshed and consolidate the Cities."
china_events.241.b:0 "No, we shall bring all imperialists to justice!"

china_events.999.t:0 "Undoing the Age of Humiliation?"
china_events.999.d:0 "With our administration finally stabilized after uniting China under the rightful banner of the true KMT, all of Asia now trembles before our unquestionable might and splendor. The mandate secured, most now wish to largely turn inwards as China always has, focusing on our own growth and reconstruction process while mostly ignoring the outside world aside potential economic ventures and safe allies. However, a small group of fanatics within our most fringe ranks have loudly pushed the idea that now that we are in a position of strength, it is up to we the true KMT to avenge the Century of Humiliation and the failures of the Qing once and for all by marching across the East to reclaim our old lands and beyond. These fanatics have hoped for our eventual and so-called inevitable conquest of Greater China, Central Asia, Siberia and much of wider Russia, Southeast Asia, and other extraneous territories at the fringes, though expectadley most of the party has found them to be beyond mad. However, they are right that we are in the best position now as we will probably ever be to pull off such a ballsy endeavor of revanchism, revenge, and blatant imperialism hidden behind a jingoistic facade, so what shall be our final say to these zealots?"
china_events.999.a:0 "Are you mad?! Dismiss the plans at once."
china_events.999.b:0 "We march to make China great once more!"

mac.20000.t: "The Declaration of a Muslim China"
mac.20000.d: "Inshallah and give thanks, for we have united all of China under our clique. The great families of Ma now rule these lands without question as our armies march from Hami to Beijing, but despite all our past successes, what our future shall be is left to be decided. The main idea is to keep true to our republican history, moving to create a new Republic of China. However, our forces are split on whether we should embrace the ideals of the original Republic of China and the Xinhai Revolution, or should we blaze a new path towards republicanism under the guiding light of Allah. Distancing from these republican ideals, we could always keep our past deals with the Qing as well, and move to make a compromise with the Aisin-Gioro Clan. By casting down the fool Puyi, we could crown his cousin and devout Muslim Prince Pugong as the new Dragon Emperor of the Qing. Though this new nation would still largely function as the Qing once did, this restored dynasty would be one far more friendly to their new Hui saviors. Alternatively, we could keep these dynastic aspirations but betray the Qing fully, moving to crown one of our own as a new emperor of a new dynasty, though such an outlandish move would be reviled by most of China. Whatever we choose, China is ours. Now we just have to decide on our shared destiny."
mac.20000.a: "Proclaim a new Islamic republic free from the mistakes of the past."
mac.20000.b: "Embrace the ideals of Xinhai and the First Republic in a new form."
mac.20000.c: "By the grace of Allah and the Mandate of Heaven, proclaim the Hui Dynasty."
mac.20000.e: "Keep our word to the Qing and crown Pugong as the new Emperor."

mac.20001.t: "Crowning a Ma"
mac.20001.d: "With our wild and outlandish decision to declare a new Muslim dynasty of China, all that remains before we can take this imperial journey is to pick our new monarch. Though the first of the three (or five, depending on who you ask) has largely been subjugated and made irrelevant, the second and third Ma families, along with their extra two cousin branches, all hold many proud and honored heroes of the Ma Clique that would surely make a fitting leader for our new Hui Dynasty. Who shall be chosen to lead this new China under Allah and the Dragon Throne?"
mac.20001.a: "Ma Hongbin, the proud Chairman of Gansu, is crowned."
mac.20001.b: "Ma Hongkui, the great Socialist Slayer, is crowned."
mac.20001.c: "Ma Bufang, the civic genius and man of the people, is crowned."
mac.20001.e: "Ma Lin, patron of the Yihewani and devout Muslim, is crowned."
mac.20001.f: "Ma Buqing, the tactical genius and star general, is crowned."
mac.20001.g: "Ma Hushan, slayer of Russians and lord of Tunganistan, is crowned."
mac.20001.h: "Ma Zhongying, once named Buying and now a violent outcast, is crowned."
mac.20001.i: "Ma Fuxiang, somehow still alive, is crowned as emperor."

mac.20002.t: "A New Hierarchy"
mac.20002.d: "With [root.getleader] rising to lead all of China, the Ma families have been hard at work spreading their influence and control across these vast lands. Many prestigious and prominent members of the former Ma Clique have been given positions as governors or lords over swathes of land as new internal divisions and civic systems are organized. For example, despite their other duties, Ma Bufang has been made the lord of the Khyber Pass while Ma Hongkui now lords over Dzungaria. Ma Zhanshan rides across the lands of the Mongols as Ma Jiyuan handles Manchuria and Ma Shaowu deals with the local Korean diaspora. Ma Zhongying, once disgraced, has now been entrusted to govern the isles and archipelagoes of the South and East China Seas as Ma Hongbin climbs to the ceiling of the world to lord over the Himalayas. All across the fringes of our empire, loyal members of the main Ma families take their place under [root.getleader] as we build a new Islamic paradise under Allah and the Ma families."
mac.20002.a: "Alhamdulillah!"

china_redoubt.1.d: "One by one our defences in the East have crumbled before the enemy's advance, our armies put to flight alongside the desperate refugees now packing the roads and railways leading westward. Even now further Japanese troops pour onto the North China Plain, and the time has come for the government to consider retreat. Fortunately China is vast, and the creation of a national redoubt may let us ride out the oncoming storm. The government has already begun preparations to flee to [china_national_redoubt.GetCliqueShortName], and its offices are filled with frantic activity. But, outside, the streets of the provisional capital are filled with a dead air and sombre air, roamed only by those poor souls too wretched to flee westward.

china_northern_school_desc: "§LChina's northern warlords mostly hail from the Xuantong-era military schools at Baoding and Tianjin and represent the cream of an increasingly old crop of officers. Educated in the Prussian style and fighting mainly on the northern plain, their style of command emphasises positional warfare alongside the importance of well-drilled troops; especially the artillery.§!"

Yet, for all their shortcomings, these former (and sometimes active) bandits bring a unique approach to warfare, able to remain flexible and resilient in even the most trying circumstances. Some may call their methods crude or even criminal, but they often get results.§!"

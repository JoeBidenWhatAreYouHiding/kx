### Events ###
venice.1.t:0 "First Session of the Great Council"
venice.1.d:0 "For the first time in over a hundred years, the Great Council of Venice convenes once more. Members from across the republic gather in Venice to discuss how the Venetian Republic should be structured. Already two camps have emerged between those that want Venice to be a modern republic and those that want the Republic of Old to be re-established."
venice.1.a:0 "Let us begin"

venice.2.t:0 "Election and term of the Doge"
venice.2.d:0 "The first question to come up is the election of the Doge. In the old republic, the Doge was elected for life by the Great Council. 30 members were chosen by random lot, who would then be reduced to 9 by random lot. Those 9 would name 40 members who had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 40 were reduced by lot to 12, who named 25 members. Those 25 had to be approved by 9 of the 12. The 9 would name 45, and each member had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 45 members were then reduced by lot to 11. These 11 named 45 who had to be approved by 9 of the 11. These 45 were finally reduced by lot to 25, and they would finally choose the Doge, who kept the position for life.\n\nNaturally, the old system is considered rather archaic. Those within the Great Council seeking to modernise the Republic instead propose that the Doge should be elected directly by the people and with a four-year term limit, subject to re-election."

venice.51.d.revolt:0 "The byzantine process to select the new Doge-for-life has taken weeks, but now it is down to two candidates: Giuseppe Volpi, hero of the revolt, and Girolamo Marcello. Volpi would perhaps be a shoo-in, thanks to his role in obtaining Venice's independence, but there are many conservatives who believe his industrialist background does not befit a true Doge. Marcello is far more favored for his place among the patrician families allowed to sit in the Grand Council. Still, the vote will be close."

Considering Volpi does not come from an old patrician family like Marcello, but was made an aristocrat by the Savoyard kings after unification, many in the Republic scoff at his candidacy. Even so, Volpi's connections among the newer elite and capitalists are considerable and there is a chance he could still win."

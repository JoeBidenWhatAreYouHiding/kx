CHI_expandthepowerofthezhongteju_desc:0 "The severe threats that have threatened our government in the past few months have made it clear that the ZhongTeJu and the civil police need more power to deal with any state-destructive machinations by our enemies.

CHI_chiangsnewnra:0 "Chiang's New NRA"
CHI_chiangsnewnra_desc:0 "The NRA is now only a shadow of itself after the coup. Many soldiers and officers no longer trust each other, which weakens our moral and operational ability.

CHI_chiangsbennevolentdictatorship:0 "Chiang's Benevolent Rule"
CHI_chiangsbennevolentdictatorship_desc:0 "Generalissimo Chiang's renewed path to the top was long and difficult. He saved China from the brutal tyrant Dai Chunfeng just in time and the people are grateful for that. True democracy may still be far away, but Chiang's rule is not unjust, it's a progressive and benevolent one that can be described as tough but fair. Under his rule, China can become a stable place of progress and democracy in the future."

CHI_expandthenewlifemovement:0 "Expand the New Life Movement"

CHI_anintelligenceagencywithastate_desc:0 "Even if we keep the appearance of democracy on the outside, it is clear to almost everyone in the world that the decisions are no longer made by the chinese people, but by the ZhongTeJu Central Committee and Dai Chunfeng. No citizen or foreigner can do anything in China without the ZhongTeJu being aware of it.

CHI_abolishthelegislativeyuan:0 "Abolish the Legislative Yuan"
CHI_abolishthelegislativeyuan_desc:0 "The Legislative Yuan is still a thorn in our side even after we took power. The little hope of 'democracy' and 'freedom' it embodies must come to an end!

### Political Events ###

chi_tot.1.t:0 "Chairman Dai announces a meeting of the ZhongTeJu leadership"
chi_tot.1.d:0 "Chairman Dai announced in a secret message to all senior ZhongTeJu officials that a leadership congress will be held in the capital in two weeks. At the conference, he wants to give new instructions to his subordinates and talk about other important topics. \n\nHowever, the letter also states that anyone who should not be present or lose a single word about what will be said at the conference will be executed immediately."
chi_tot.1.a:0 "Um, well, then we should rather accept Dai's friendly invitation pretty quickly..."

chi_tot.2.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 1"
chi_tot.2.d:0 "After all conference attendees arrived and took their seats, Chairman Dai stood up to deliver his opening speech: \n'My comrades, not too long ago we saved the state and the party from the total collapse that the previous, incompetent party leadership had endured through their erratic leadership. China must never come into such a situation again if we want that the party state can survive! \nTherefore, I hereby announce that the government will implement far-reaching reforms in the near future that will ensure that every citizen is fully committed to the state. We will achieve this by expanding the ZhongTeJu and giving the civil police more powers. \nThe goal must be that the party knows at all times where each citizen is and what he is doing at the moment. The details will be discussed later today.' \n\nDai paused for a moment and he began to grin in amusement, then he continued: \n\n'Unfortunately, not all of those present here will see our plan continue, some have stupidly allowed themselves outrageous comments against me and my government, which I consider to be opositional and counterrevolutionary thinking, which will be punished with full severity.' \n\nAfter Dai finished his speech, a dozen of the conference participants were roughly grabbed by the Chairman's bodyguards and dragged out of the room, while Dai comfortably drank a whiskey and talked to a few officers and party members. \n\nA short time later, a few shots were heard from outside, but nobody in the hall knowingly took note of it, because whoever should also anger the Chairman ends up like those poor bastards outside."
chi_tot.2.a:0 "Did anyone hear anything? No? Well! Let's have a whiskey with Chairman Dai!"

chi_tot.3.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 2 (Part 1)"
chi_tot.3.d:0 "The second day of the conference was actually quite normal compared to yesterday, but there was a certain tension among those present in the hall. Because everyone knew what happened yesterday and the Dai announced that he wanted to share top secret information with them today. Shortly after the lunch break, Chairman Dai spoke again: \n\n'My comrades, as I announced yesterday, it’s time to reveal the real reason why I have called this conference in the first place. Our whole operation of overthrowing the previous government was only possible because, in addition to infiltrating the bureaucracy through our ZhongTeJu, we had help with strategic planning and the elimination of the risk of a reaction from the NRA, namely through this familiar face! Come out of the shadow, Marshal Chiang!' \n\nAt that moment, behind the lectern at which Dai stands, a man in a black uniform, with sunglasses, a face completely scarred, and with the rank badge of a ZhongTeJu Marshal stepped out of the shadows. \nEven though it is not easy to see due to the many wounds, it is no doubt Chiang Kai-shek is now standing next to Dai Chunfeng. \nEveryone in the room was paralyzed with shock, because nobody could believe that Marshal Chiang, who died during the German intervention, should really be standing up there on the Podeum. \n\nChiang smiled and went to the lectern beside Dai: \n\n'Greetings to you all, my former friends and comrades, it's been a while since I saw the faces of some of you here for the last time. Some of you will probably be asking yourself: \nHow is that possible? Why is he still alive?"
chi_tot.3.a:0 "It's actually quite simple:"

chi_tot.4.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 2 (Part 2)"
chi_tot.4.d:0 "First the how: I owe it to my friend Dai Chunfeng that I can stand here in front of you today and nobody else. \nAnd now why: I didn't die during the intervention like the foreign press hastily announced, no, the assassins who were after me seriously wounded me and left me there to die, not knowing that I wasn’t dead. I somehow made it out of there, but had completely lost my memory. I no longer knew where I came from or who I was. I was so disfigured by my wounds on my face and whole body that no one recognized me whom I met while aimlessly roaming the country. \n\nA simple peasant family called Hu from Hunan took me in after they found me starving in a dirty ditch and took pity on me. They gave me food, a job in their fields and a place to sleep. The father of the family gave me the name Hu Changning because I couldn't remember my own. \nAfter that, five years went by until I was approached by a man in a hooded coat one day while I was doing my work in the field. He spoke to me and asked: 'Old friend, it is nice to see you again.' \n\nThat man was Dai Chunfeng. \n\n'He helped me regain my memory and secretly included me in the ranks of the ZhongTeJu. \nI have been hiding until today so that the disgusting Germans have no reason to invade China again. \nBut now that China has become a power to take on the western imperialists, Dai and I have decided that it is time to at least reveal to the people present here in this room, that I'm alive.' \n\nThe shock among the ZhongTeJu members continued as Chiang ended his speech and took a seat next to Dai. They still couldn’t believe what just happened. \n\nThe conference will continue tomorrow morning as everyone has to digest this overwhelming revelation first."
chi_tot.4.a:0 "What?! How did the Chairman manage to hide Chiang from us for so long?!"

chi_tot.5.t:0 "ZhongTeJu Conference: Day 3"
chi_tot.5.d:0 "After yesterday's shock, the third day of the conference began. Chiang Kai-shek was now one of the people in the room, sitting at the front of the same table as Chairman Dai. \n\nIn a five-hour speech, the chairman outlined his plan for permanent pacification across China. He said that it had been tolerated for far too long that many of our former enemies are still at large or in exile. In his view, China cannot be safe from these people's destructive ideas until they are in custody. Because if these people somehow manage to regain influence and incite people against our rule, our country will again face massive unrest. That is why the ZhongTeJu and the national civil police are given extensive powers by the Kuomintang Central Committee to maintain order in the country. \n\nDai also ordered that every senior member and leader of the federalists, the Fengtian government, the Qing Empire, the Zhili clique, influential warlords with secessionist ambitions, the Yiguandao cult, and the left and right Kuomintang be arrested immediately . To be on the safe side, these people's families are also detained for the time being until we have decided what to do with them. \n\nAfter the rest of the speakers had also finished their lectures, the conference was closed by Chairman Dai shortly before midnight. In his closing remarks he reminded everyone present that he expected absolute silence about everything discussed here and that all of his instructions were to be implemented immediately."
chi_tot.5.a:0 "Applause for the party and Chairman Dai!"

chi_tot.6.t:0 "NRA Coup: Attack on the Capital!"
chi_tot.6.d:0 "The streets of the capital were almost deserted, only a few people could be seen running across the streets. \n\nChairman Dai yesterday announced martial law for the entire city and imposed a curfew. And on the city's main squares and main streets, the NRA and ZhongTeJu have set up barricades and checkpoints as if they were expecting an attack. \n\nThe tension in the whole city had been unbearable all day and the soldiers looked extremely nervous. \n\nThen in the early afternoon, hell broke out over the city. At some checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, the NRA soldiers started shooting ZhongTeJu troops and opening the barricades. Whereupon further NRA units advanced towards the city center, which were strategically positioned in the villages and forests around the city. \n\nHowever, the ZhongTeJu and loyal NRA units quickly reorganized and intercepted the rebel NRA units only a few hundred meters later and embroiled them in violent battles. \n\nAccording to reports, Chiang Kai-shek was seen in one of the attacking armored vehicles as they set up their command post in a school building."
chi_tot.6.a:0 "And so the fight for the capital begins"

chi_tot.7.t:0 "NRA Coup: Fight for the Capital's Airport!"
chi_tot.7.d:0 "After the putschists were able to advance into the city through the betrayal of some NRA units on the outskirts of the city, our scouts identified their first target: \n\nThe putschists are advancing towards the airport to cut off our air supply! Some loyal troops have already been stationed there to ward off the attack. A little later the attackers arrived and started firing at our troops. \n\nAfter a few hours of fierce fighting, a message came in from one of our forward command posts that said:"
chi_tot.7.a:0 "The loyal troops repelled the attackers and defended the airport!"
chi_tot.7.b:0 "The putschists smashed our defense and took the airport!"

chi_tot.8.t:0 "NRA Coup: Siege of the Capital's Central Station!"
chi_tot.8.d:0 "After the battle for the airport, the putschists are now moving towards the central station to cut us off completely from any supply! \n\nOur soldiers have already dug trenches there and stationed machine guns to ward off possible attacks. \nFortunately, the number of attackers was less than that of our defenders and the two units facing each other are about the same strength, our loyal troops have the manpower advantage, but our opponents use tanks, it remained to be seen who was stronger. \n\nIn the course of the battle it became clear after a few hours who had the upper hand:"
chi_tot.8.a:0 "The loyal troops successfully defended the Central Station!"
chi_tot.8.b:0 "The Central Station falls into the hands of the putschists!"

chi_tot.9.t:0 "NRA Coup: Fight for the KMT Central Committee building!"
chi_tot.9.d:0 "Even before the battle for Central Station was over, the coup leaders launched a frontal attack on the Kuomitang Central Committee building. \n\nBy conquering the building, the putschists apparently wanted to reckon the morale of our defending troops so that they could advance into the city more easily. \n\nThe fighting lasted most of the day, but shortly before sunset it became clear that:"
chi_tot.9.a:0 "The loyal troops defended the Central Committee building!"
chi_tot.9.b:0 "The putschists conquered the Central Committee building!"

chi_tot.10.t:0 "NRA Coup: Attack on the Capital Garrison!"
chi_tot.10.d:0 "Bad news! \n\nWhile we paid attention to the defense of the Central Committee, a unit of the putschists managed to advance to the garrison of the capital and start an attack on it! \n\nWe had to withdraw troops from the surrounding fronts to defend the Granision. Unfortunately, the enemy managed to penetrate the complex's forecourt before our troops could counterattack! \n\nEven after several hours of fighting, shots were still heard from the building complex and it was difficult to get information about the status of the troops, but now we are certain that:"
chi_tot.10.a:0 "The Garrison was successfully defended by the loyal troops!"
chi_tot.10.b:0 "The Garrison and the Equipment there fell into the hands of the putschists!"

chi_tot.11.t:0 "NRA Coup: Siege of ZhongTeJu Headquarters!"
chi_tot.11.d:0 "It came as it had to come: the fighting in the city had now reached the ZhongTeJu headquarters, where Dai Chunfeng was staying and organizing the city's defense. \n\nThe main forces of the two parties to the conflict now faced each other in the streets and squares around the building and fought a bitter battle. No one on both sides was willing to back down now because everyone was aware of the importance of the building. If ZhongTeJu headquarters falls, it would put Dai Chunfeng in a pretty bad position, but if the attack is repelled, the attackers' main forces would be severely weakened. \n\nShortly before midnight, one side finally managed to strike the decisive blow:"
chi_tot.11.a:0 "The loyal troops defended the building and are now preparing to counterattack!"
chi_tot.11.b:0 "Dai Chunfeng fled the building with his retreating loyal troops to reorganize!"

chi_tot.12.t:0 "The dust begins to settle..."
chi_tot.12.d:0 "Now that only a few small battles are taking place in the entire city area and the fire brigade has started to put out the fires in the buildings, a victorious side has now emerged as the dust begins to settle. \n\nAfter evaluating several reports, it can be said that..."
chi_tot.12.a:0 "...the Coup was..."

chi_tot.13.t.dai:0 "...a failure! And Chiang Kai-shek has been arrested!"
chi_tot.13.t.kai_shek:0 "...a success! And Dai Chunfeng has been arrested!"
chi_tot.13.d.dai:0 "Outstanding work! Execute all these traitors on the spot! But bring Chiang directly to the Chairman, he wants to personally execute him!\n\nAnd congratulations to our loyal soldiers! Long live the party! Long live the Chairman!"
chi_tot.13.d.kai_shek:0 "Cheers to our success! Arrest all followers of Dai's government and disarm the NRA units that fought for him! Make sure Dai Chunfeng is safely housed in a cell until we can bring him to court!"
chi_tot.13.a:0 "Ah, sweet victory! Long live the Chairman!"
chi_tot.13.b:0 "The day is ours! Long live the Generalissimo!"

chi_tot.14.t:0 "Dai Chunfeng consolidates his power!"
chi_tot.14.d:0 "Dai was sitting in a meeting room with some of his closest allies, reflecting on the coup a few days ago, and was certain that the past few days were perhaps the greatest and probably the final threat to his rule over China. Then he spoke: \n'You will probably wonder why I called you here, gentlemen. And you may be wondering why I am not celebrating the victory over Chiang's coup. But if you thought about it, it is actually quite simple: such a one Treachery like that of Chiang, a man I saved and trusted, cannot have been planned without help from the inside! Chiang died yesterday by my hand, but that's not the end of it! There are people sitting at this table , who have rather stuffed their pockets and celebrated large parties in the past few years instead of doing their job properly!' \nDai hit the table with full force. \n 'Please tell me how it can be that military units like Chiang's can be strategically positioned around and in the capital without being noticed!' \nEveryone at the table was silent. \nWell, I have found some evidence that some of you have been offered bribes and a safe escape from China by the coup leaders if you in return make me fall into the hands of Chiang! Would anyone like to contradict me?' \nSome of the attendees were visibly nervous when Dai paused to look around. \nThen Dai snapped his finger and his guards pulled out their guns and shot everyone in the room except a general and two senior ZhongTeJu administrators. Then Dai spoke again: 'I hope the three of you now understand the terrible consequences of disobedience. You now have a choice, you will either continue to serve me as a loyal subordinate, or I will kill and replace you as well. And so that it is clear: China is mine and only mine and everyone who wants to contest it will end up like the dead traitors here in the room!'"
chi_tot.14.a:0 "Everyone is happy to accept Dais's kind offer! Long live the Chairman!"

chi_tot.15.t:0 "Generalissimo Chiang's first public appearance!"
chi_tot.15.d:0 "Thousands of people had gathered in front of the Kuomintang Central Committee building this morning because the new Chairman wanted to address the nation. None of the audience knew exactly who this new chairman actually was. It was only a few days since Dai Chunfeng was arrested and the NRA coup was over, and order had not yet been fully restored in and around the capital. Still everyone was excited to find out who had defied and overthrown the tyrant Dai. \nAfter the square and the street in front of the Central Committee were almost overcrowded, a person finally stepped onto the balcony of the building. People were a little shocked when they saw that it was a terribly disfigured man in uniform who was now standing up there. Then he started to speak and the voice sounded strangely familiar: \n'I greet you warmly, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you for showing up here today, despite the difficult situation! As you have probably already learned, Dai Chunfeng and his followers were arrested for their crimes against the Chinese people and I was elected new Chairman.' \nBy now, pretty much everyone had realized that the man on the balcony was none other than the believed dead Chiang Kai-shek! \n'I understand your shocking that I suddenly reappear, even though everyone thought I was killed during the German intervention. But I can assure you that I was never killed, I had only completely lost my memory. I don't want to lengthen this speech unnecessarily today and therefore I have only one request to all of you: Please help me and the party to lead China out of this dark, difficult time by keeping everyone calm and helping with the reconstruction. Trust the government and give us some time, we will make sure that every citizen can live safely and freely! A new democratization will take place as soon as China is stable again! Thank you for your attention!'"
chi_tot.15.a:0 "The... the Generalissimo lives?!"

chi_tot.16.t:0 "Replacement of the Legislative Yuan"
chi_tot.16.d:0 "The seats in the Legislative Yuan, the parliament of the Chinese National State, have now largely been filled with our loyal followers and put on government line, but there are still some politicians from other KMT factions who are aggressively opposing our government there. Even if these politicians no longer have political power, their words still reach our people. We cannot tolerate this any longer! For this reason, the Chairman of the Legislative Yuan proposed a bill that would combine the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan and the Kuomintang Central Committee to save costs and personnel. This new body will then become known as the Supreme National Assembly and will have 3,000 seats. It will manage both the executive and the legislature under the direct leadership of the President, who is also the Chairman of the KMT and head of ZhongTeJu. Opposition politicians condemned this proposal as dictatorial and autocratic and that it was only an attempt to destroy democracy and centralize power on Dai Chunfeng. They protested until just before the vote, but it didn't help them. The law was adopted by an absolute majority of the votes of the members of the now abolished Legislative Yuan. The critical politicians have thus finally lost their seats and their remaining influence, since the members of the Supreme National Assembly can only be appointed on the proposal of the Examination Yuan and the President himself."
chi_tot.16.a:0 "The Supreme National Assembly brings stability!"

chi_tot.17.t:0 "The Hundred Flowers Campaign"
chi_tot.17.d:0 "As discussed in advance by the Central Committee, the Hundred Flowers Movement is being launched today. For the duration of the campaign, all citizens of the country can send their criticism or suggestions for improvement directly to the government by sending a letter with name and address to the President's office. After half a year, all letters sent should then be evaluated and then a plan drawn up to implement the best ideas. \n\nChairman Dai just remarked again that it is really important that everyone who writes a letter should give their exact address so that it will be easier to find and reward the citizens if one of their ideas is implemented! \n\nMany intellectuals and critics, who have so far been hiding out of fear, welcome the campaign and agreed to participate in it. Others sense a deadly trap and call on their colleagues to be careful! What a nonsense! \n\nChairman Dai also said at the end of the campaign opening ceremony: 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend!'"
chi_tot.17.a:0 "Please write a lot of letters! We 'really' want to hear the opinion of the people!"

chi_tot.18.t:0 "The Chinese Surveillance State"
chi_tot.18.d:0 "Chairman Dai has done what no one in China's modern history has done before: he has united China under the banner of a single central government. But he is not yet satisfied with the success. \n\nf we have learned one thing from the events of the past few months, it is that we cannot trust our citizens. \nWe can no longer tolerate our citizens putting their so-called 'personal freedom' or their 'families' above the interests of the state, the party and the chairman. All citizens must understand that their lives now belong to the state. \n\nFor this reason, Chairman Dai has been able to extend the state of emergency by decree, abolish all citizens and human rights and have ordered the ZhongTeJu and the police to take even harder action against our enemies. The measures we have already taken may be extremely harsh, but as we have seen during the Hundred Flowers Movement, it has not been enough to make all critics tremble with fear and finally silence them. Therefore, from now on, all citizens will be divided into categories and evaluated using a points system. All who have a high score and are loyal can live a good life, but all those who accumulate minus points will be 'sorted out' for the good of all. Our country will only be absolutely perfect if the state, the people and the party act as one. \n\n\nA new morning dawns for China, but this morning does not belong to the Chinese people, it belongs solely to Chairman Dai."
chi_tot.18.a:0 "The future belongs only to those who have fought hard for it! Long live the Chairman!"

chi_tot.19.t:0 "The Fate of Dai Chunfeng"
chi_tot.19.d:0 "'China has regained its freedom! Down with the traitor Dai! ' These were the words on the front page of many major daily newspapers that have resumed their work. \n\nThe coup is not too long ago, but the people are already in a spirit of optimism because they have confidence again and the tyrant Dai has been deposed. \n\nAt the moment, Dai Chunfeng is sitting in a high security cell waiting for his execution. The judgment was already foreseeable in the eyes of many, because treason is almost always punished with death by the Supreme Military Court. \n\nThe moment of his execution had come a few days after the verdict. Dai and a few of his most loyal followers, who were also sentenced to death, were taken to the gallows, where they were hanged shortly afterwards. The court denied the criminals the right to have final words before the execution. \n\nThis is how the dark chapter of Dai Chunfeng's tyrannical dictatorship ends. Now the Chinese people under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and the NRA can take a new path to a better future. Chiang has announced that he will temporarily lead a military government and appoint a new interim government in a few months."
chi_tot.19.a:0 "China can breathe again and celebrate its new freedom!"

chi_tot.20.t:0 "Generalissimo Chiang forms a new government!"
chi_tot.20.d:0 "As announced shortly after taking office, Chiang Kai-shek will appoint a new interim government today. \nThe Generalissimo has several options available: \n\nHe could ask the §CMinzu Faction of the Kuomintang§!, who survived Dais' wave of cleansing, to work with the §RNRA§! to form a more §Cdemocratic interim government§! until an election for a new Legislative Yuan can be held. \n\nAlternatively, he could expand the §RNRA military government§! and completely dissolve the purged remains of §RZhongTeJu§!, which have so far supported the government until he believes China is ready for §Crenewed democratization§!, which is sure to be received with some §Rsuspicion by the people§!. \n\nOn the other hand, many of Chiangs §Oinfluential advisors§! urge that we should continue to maintain the current state of transition until the situation calms down, which could have §Rfatal consequences§! for our government if something should happen in the meantime."
chi_tot.20.a:0 "The Generalissimo forms an NRA military government!"
chi_tot.20.b:0 "Generalissimo Chiang invites the Minzu Faction to form a government!"

It was only through the strength of our citizens and our NRA's loyalty to the constitution that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek succeeded in overthrowing the tyrant Dai and restoring order. Chiang would like to deliver a speech to Nation today announcing the new course for China: \n\n'My friends! I want to thank you all for your hard work in the past months, without your help it wouldn't have been possible to stabilize the country again! I can't deny that at first I wasn't particularly happy about the dominance of the left wing of the KMT in the country and that the right wing was completely wiped out by Dai Chunfeng, but in recent years I have become a man capable of compromising! Our country is different today than it was in 1925, today we stand together with a united and upright spirit! Let's build a better China together! I hereby announce the first free elections for the Legislative Yuan! My allegiance was to the Republic, to democracy! Thank you!'"

Either through brawls in the central committee or by talking for hours in front of the National Assembly without contributing anything to the actual debate. That has to stop! \n\nTherefore Chairman Dai has ordered the ZhongTeJu to remove these party members. \nIn the past few days, dozens of critics have been arrested by the police on fabricated allegations and transferred to the ZhongTeJu to pay for their 'crimes'. One of our secret courts has already decided that anyone arrested must be executed immediately as they pose a threat to national security. All other doubters must realize that false statements can quickly become dangerous for them and that loyalty to us is vital to survival."

That has to stop! \n\nThat is why Generalissimo Chiang has ordered the police to investigate party members who have sympathy for Dai Chunfeng, who have been violent in the past, and could therefore plan possible attacks or attacks. \n\nFor example, several terrorist cells have been excavated in the past few days, which attempted to carry out several attacks on government buildings and officials. The Supreme Court today sentenced these people to life imprisonment without parole.

chi_tot_ztj_murders.1.d:0 "Today, the first wave of political prisoners and their families have arrived in state prisons across the country, where they have been locked in their cells. The majority of our enemies were caught by the police and secret service when they were preparing to flee China. Most of them complied with their fate, but there were also some who preferred to commit suicide rather than to be captured. \n\nThe most prominent among them is the former Chairman Wang Jingwei: \nWhen the ZhongTeJu Officers entered Wang's office in his home to arrest him, a terrible picture emerged: \n\nWang Jingwei was crying at his desk, holding a pistol in his hand, on the floor the bodies of his wife and children, all with a bullet wound in their heads.\n\nWhen he saw the officers, he said to them: \n'You bastards will never be able to harm me or my family, I have protected them from the cruel torment that will await us in captivity! I refuse to take part in Dai's sick game somehow making political capital out of us!' \n\nAfter these words, he pointed the gun at his head and pulled the trigger. \n\nThen there was silence. \n\nThe officers were speechless and at first didn't know what to do, but then they decided to take the bodies to their bedrooms and burn the house and put the guilt for the Wang family's death on the fire."

The Central Committee must act now to prevent the danger of a new civil war! The common people must not question us, they must do and believe exactly what we tell them! And not what some traitors write in their dirty newspapers!"

You must read this report immediately! Something terrible is going on in our prisons!' \n\nChiang carefully read the report, which said that the ZhongTeJu is no longer just executing political prisoners, but is now mass murdering their families! \nYesterday, Chen Jiongming and other leaders of the federalists were first executed, then their families were murdered! \nThis text apparently only found its way onto his table because the ZhongTeJu requested trucks from the NRA to remove the bodies and one of the drivers had a conscience and informed the military secret service that they were carrying enormous amounts of bodies of women and children out of the prisons . \nChiang was disgusted and shocked by what he had just read and turned to his adjutant: \n\n'Lieutenant, arrange a meeting with Chairman Dai immediately! I need to find out if he knows that his ZhongTeJu is massacring these innocent people in prisons!' \n\n'Yes! I will arrange it immediately, sir!'"

And not just the prisoners, but also their families! How can you explain that to me? Do you know of this cruel hideousness?' \n\nDai's face instantly darkened from a friendly smile to an angry face. \n\nDai: 'This is not something that is relevant to you in any way, is that clear? You ask if I know about it? I ordered it myself! How else can I stabilize China and secure our power if my enemies and their dirty clans are allowed to run around alive? If I don't remove the entire root, weeds will sprout again in the same place! This is the only way we can ensure prosperity and progress!' \n\nChiang: 'Have you gone completely insane? Punishing our enemies with the full rigor of the law is one thing, but we can't just murder innocent women and children because you believe your interests are at risk! We...' \n\nDai: 'YOU DARE TO TALK TO ME THIS WAY! Never forget that it was me who found you there in that dirty field and it was me who helped you get your memories back! And now you dare to stab me in the back? Remember where your place is and immediately forget everything you just told me!' \n\nChiang: 'I'm sorry, but I cannot overlook the fact that you obviously have no interest in doing good for China with your position, you are only interested in your personal power expansion! And in order to achieve your goal you even walk over the bodies of innocent women and children! I will never forget what you did for me, but this is going way too far!'"

But at the same time, NRA soldiers came through the door behind Chiang and aimed their rifles at Dai and his guards. \n\nDai laughed. \n\nDai: 'So you intended to eliminate me as soon as you knew the truth, right? I'm almost proud of you, that's exactly what I would have done in your situation! I would say we are currently in a stalemate.' \n\nChiang: 'I would say that too' \n\nDai: 'I'm sorry, but I still have other important appointments today, I think we need to clarify that later, so we won't be able to resolve our dispute now.

chi_tot_flavour.1.d:0 "Our efforts to make the New Life movement a success are finally bearing fruit: \n\nThis morning we received a telegram from the newly founded central committee of the so-called 'National Revolutionary Teachers' Association' (NRTA). They congratulate us on our righteous efforts to make China a modern state that can compete with the West, and they would be happy to help us. In their message, they suggest that we make them the official umbrella organization of all teachers in China under their chairman, a simple teacher from Hunan Province called Mao Zedong. \n\nIn return, they promise us that all teachers at all schools across the country will fully represent our ideals and pass them on to the next generation so that our children can fully understand Sun Yat-sen's ideas and become better people and successful adults."
chi_tot_flavour.1.a:0 "An excellent suggestion! Invite Mao to a meeting so we can discuss that!"
chi_tot_flavour.1.b:0 "What a nonsense! What credible references can this 'Chairman Mao' show us?"

chi_tot_flavour.2.t:0 "Foundation of the National Revolutionary Boy Scouts"
chi_tot_flavour.2.d:0 "Just a few months after the founding of the NRTA, its efforts are already having a positive effect on our education system, now Chairman Mao approached our government with another proposal: The founding of National Revolutionary Boy Scouts (NRBS), modeled on the United States' Boy Scouts but with Chinese characteristics. \n\nWith the help of the NRBS, our students will be taught many useful manual skills and the value of teamwork and friendship so that they can learn how to behave as a loyal and responsible citizen of the Republic of China. \n\nThis proposal is very similar to an idea that has been under discussion within our government for a while now, but it could be even more effective than ours through close cooperation with the NRTA leadership."
chi_tot_flavour.2.a:0 "That is a very good idea! Let's contact the NRTA!"
chi_tot_flavour.2.b:0 "Mao should rather concentrate on his lessons!"

chi_tot_flavour.3.t:0 "Foundation of the National Revolutionary Youth Summer Camps"
chi_tot_flavour.3.d:0 "Chairman Mao and the NRTA presented our government with another great idea that we could use to better support our students. \n\nThey proposed the establishment of National Revolutionary Youth Summer Camps, where our students can spend their holidays meaningfully by playing sports together, singing patriotic songs, learning useful skills for life, or strengthening group cohesion. \n\nAccording to the NRTA, this would not only benefit our students, but ensure that the state later has capable, useful adults who conscientiously live their lives and enjoy their work. \n\nBut now we have to ask ourselves whether we want to continue to provide money for the NRTA projects. Their efforts in all honor, but we cannot deny that their influence is growing faster and faster ..."

chi_tot_flavour.4.d:0 "After all previous projects that were planned and implemented by the NRTA were each a complete success, the government decided to commission them with the complete revision of our current education system. \n\nAfter a few weeks, the final plan was presented to us personally by Chairman Mao: \nIt provides that we should implement ideas already developed in our country by our teachers, but also adapt the best of the best of the education systems in western countries and Japan to ensure that the reform can be a complete success. Mao gave the plan the name: "The Great Education Leap Forward". \n\nMao also said that in order to implement all of this, the NRTA needs the full cooperation of the Ministry of Education, as well as an expansion of its powers. Many in our government support the NRTA's plan, but there are also voices warning that the NRTA, and especially Mao, shouldn't be given more influence in our government because the many projects are already consuming enormous amounts of money. Therefore, they suggest that we should replace Mao with someone less ambitious as the chairman of the NRTA and that we have to significantly reduce the high expenses."

chi_tot_flavour.5.d:0 "After the success of the NRTA and Chairman Mao in improving and modernizing our education system became more and more noticeable in the country, Generalissimo Chiang decided to restructure his cabinet and to appoint Chairman Mao as the new Minister of Education. \n\nIn his speech, Chiang stated that Mao was a true Chinese patriot who, through his hard work, made China's education system competitive with those of the West and Japan in just a few years. And he says it fills him with pride and trust to see that he even works on holidays to improve the educational standard of the people. And projects that would have taken dozens of years before can now be carried out in just a few years under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao."

He was angry that Dai had kept it secret all the time, that he still had a family, and had even actively prevented him from ever remembering it. \nAfter talking for more hours, Chiang decided that they should continue meeting in the coming weeks to help him remember everything that had happened in the past."

To make up for it, he asked the two of them if they could help him rebuild China and free it from Dais dark shadow. \nThe two agreed to continue supporting their father. Together they will create a better country for the people."

Among them were intellectuals, simple farmers and fishermen, factory workers and of course also politicians who had hoped to gain prominence and influence again. \n\nThey will all notice that they were fatally wrong. \n\nShortly after the report was evaluated, people across the country who insulted us with their unjustified, outrageous criticism were either shot immediately by the ZhongTeJu, the national Police, or extradited to lynch mobs to amuse our loyal followers, who then brutally murdered these traitors . \n\nThe streets of the country are colored deep red by the huge amount of blood that was shed today, but now even the last traitors in our country should finally understand that we will not stop until they are all dead. All in all, one can say that the movement was a complete success for our side, we managed to lure our enemies out of the reserve by clever action in order to destroy them. \n\nNow China is finally free from selfishness and betrayal by dissatisfied people. Everyone in the country now serves only one purpose, the one goal of making China the greatest nation in the world, and above all serving President Dai, our great Supreme Leader!"

The Minzu Faction of the KMT advocates democratization, but is against allowing other parties besides the KMT in the near future and hehemently refuses to support the Syndicalist Party or the European Syndicalists. In this election, however, they also support Chiang Kai-shek as the top candidate for the office of chairman of the KMT. \n\nThen there is the §OCentral Club Clique§!, an alliance of supporters of the former right-wing KMT, as well as close friends and loyal supporters of Generalissimo Chiang, most notably the brothers Chen Lifu and Chen Goufu, who lead the Clique alongside Chiang. \n\nThe other factions, §TMinquan§! and §RMinsheng§!, are still in a leadership crisis after the tragic deaths of Song Qingling and Wang Jingwei and therefore have no significant chances of winning a majority in this election. \n\nNow everyone was eagerly waiting for all the votes to be counted and the winner is:"

Fang Junying has shaped the faction in recent years along the lines of Song Qinlingss ideas and has advocated that the KMT should allow more parties in the future and work more closely with the Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Syndicalists in the rest of the world. \n\nIn contrast, Wang Jingweis longtime follower, Chen Gongbo, has asserted himself in the Minsheng Faction and is now leading it. He reaffirmed the KMT's claim to leadership across China and considers it dangerous to allow other parties, and supports continued tutelage of the people. He also advocates that China itself should take an active leadership role in the world instead of becoming a lap dog of the Europeans. \n\nThe Minzu Faction has announced that they want to run this election with their leader Li Liejun as their own candidate because they disagreed with some of Chiang's decisions in the past legislative period and therefore rule out further cooperation with him. \n\nAnd, as expected, the CC-Clique has announced that it will run again with Chiang Kai-shek as their top candidate after 'the Minzu Faction has foolishly insulted him and the other two factions cannot be expected to do any decent government work,' as Chen Lifu said. \n\nNow everyone was eagerly waiting for all the votes to be counted and the winner is:"

### Monument to Party Founding ###

chi_tot_monument.1.t:0 "Construction of the Monument to Party Founding"
chi_tot_monument.1.d:0 "Today our ideologues and architects presented us with the blueprints for the planned large monument to the party foundation. \nThe outdoor area is said to be decorated with imposing 20 meter high statues of the former party leaders, including Sun Yat-sen and even Wang Jingwei. \nAt the same time, a large museum is to be housed in the monument, in which the history of the National Revolution is exhibited in detail. \n\nThe monument would without question be a huge propaganda tool as soon as it is finished, but the cost of this project has already reached a critical value during the planning phase. \nThe Treasury has already warned us that we would have to raise taxes to fund it, which the people are probably not going to like. \nOn the other hand, we already advertised this project so massively in advance that it should now be almost impossible to simply cancel it without making it look as if we were unable to carry out such a construction project! \n\nThe decision is now up to the Chairman: To build or not to build, that is the question."
chi_tot_monument.1.a:0 "Let the construction begin!"

chi_tot_monument.2.t:0 "Completion of the Monument to Party Founding!"
chi_tot_monument.2.d:0 "Today, after almost a year, the monument of the Kuomintang party was completed by our hardworking construction workers! \n\nThis monument will now be used for party events, but also for state acts! This monument is further proof that only the KMT government is both the only lawful government in all of China and the only party that can rule China! \n\nThis monument should show future generations how the KMT united China through hard, righteous work and turned it into a people's paradise!"
chi_tot_monument.2.a:0 "Without the Kuomintang there would be no new China!"

### Leader Desc ###

POLITICS_CHIANG_KAI_SHEK_DESC:0 "After falling out of favor after the failed Northern Expedition in 1925, his political enemies attempted an assassination attempt on the Generalissimo, which ultimately led Chiang Kai-shek to lose his memory due to his many serious injuries. \nIn the years that followed, the former Generalissimo, whom everyone thought was dead, wandered aimlessly through the rural regions of China and survived as a simple field worker. \nThen one day he was found by his influential friend Dai Chunfeng, the leader of the KMT secret service ZhongTeJu, and was secretly converted to his personal enforcer and military advisor. \nBut Dai's interest was less in really helping Chiang regain his memories than in securing a comfortable position of power within the party through his military experience. \nHowever, it did not take long after Dai's bloody takeover until Chiang realized that his 'old friend' had only used him to achieve his personal sinister goals. \nAfter some extremely bloody murders carried out by Dai's agents, the generalissimo decided to put an end to Dai's tyranny before he could drag China down with him. \nNow that Chiang Kai-shek is back at the head of the state and can remember almost everything from his past, the question remains how he will shape the future of China. He has gained a lot of new experiences and ideas in the past few years, but will he be able to cope with the fact that the KMT and all of China are different today than they were over ten years ago? \n\nOnly time can tell."

POLITICS_FANG_JUNYING_DESC:0 "After the brutal murder of Song Qingling by agents of the ZhongTeJu, a power struggle broke out within the Minquan faction after Generalissimo Chiang's counter-coup. \nThere were many promising candidates for the position of chairman, including the influential Chen Mingshu, who was to be her main competitor. \nAfter months of debate within the Faction, Fang Junying finally succeeded in winning the chairmanship. \nUnder her leadership, Song Qingling's policy will continue, with the exception that Fang Junying studied in the Commune of France for years and wants to introduce some ideas of syndicalism into Chinese society that she believes will improve the lives of both workers and peasants."

POLITICS_LI_LIEJUN_DESC:0 "After the brutal murder of Sun Fo, Sun Yat-sen's only son, a brief power struggle broke out within the Minzu faction following the counter-coup by Generalissimo Chiang, which the influential General Li Liejun quickly won. \nGeneral Li is now known as a sharp critic of the general sissimo, after he had arguments with him on several political issues in the last legislative period. \nGeneral Li's political line is known for refusing, like Sun Fo, to give up the Kuomintang's absolute claim to leadership over China in the near future and to allow other parties to run for elections. He believes that the people are not ready for such an undertaking at the moment."

POLITICS_CHEN_GONGBO_DESC:0 "After the brutal murder of Wang Jingwei, the great chairman who brought the national revolution to China again and made it a success this time, his longtime follower Chen Gongbo was appointed as his successor as chairman of the Minsheng Faction.. \nHe will continue the political line of Chairman Wang for the most part almost unchanged, the only thing to note is that he is an extreme opponent of cooperation with the European Syndicalists, because he believes that they only helped the Kuomintang during the 1936 National Revolution to gain a foothold in Asia."

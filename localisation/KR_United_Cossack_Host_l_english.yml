### Events ###
uch.1.t: "Uniting the Cossack Hosts"
uch.1.d: "The First Union of Cossack Hosts, established in April 1917 by decision of the First General Cossack Congress, was the first attempt at uniting the Cossacks, but it was short-lived, being destroyed after the Bolshevik coup. It was succeeded by the Southeastern Union, which sought to resist the Bolshevik regime, but it too failed, unable to form a unified military force.\n\nIn July 1918, Ataman Krasnov attempted to create the Don-Caucasus Cossack Union, yet this endeavor also met with failure. Despite these setbacks, it is now time to consider reuniting the dispersed Cossack forces across Eurasia to face their primary adversaries: the Soviets and the chaos they represent. It is essential to set aside our differences and unite as one front against those who threaten not only Russia but the entire civilized and Christian world."
uch.1.a: "The Cossacks will save the Motherland."

uch.2.t: "[FROM.GetFactionName] Invites Us"
uch.2.d: "The leader of [FROM.GetNameDef], ataman [FROM.GetLeader], assumed the responsibility of establishing a new confederation of Cossack forces with the aim of liberating their homeland and providing mutual support in the struggle against the adversaries of the Russian nation. They extend an invitation to our nation to join their ranks as an equal partner."
uch.2.a: "We will gladly join our brothers!"
uch.2.b: "We are better without them."

uch.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
uch.3.d: "Regrettably, [FROM.GetNameDef] declined to join the alliance, recalling past unsuccessful endeavours and anticipating that they might be spared from the onslaught currently dominating Russia. Their decision will be met with regret, yet eventually, all Cossack Hosts will be compelled to align with this righteous alliance."
uch.3.a: "We are better without them."

uch.310.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepted!"
uch.310.d: "Our allies in [FROM.GetNameDef] have eagerly accepted the call to join our Union, which aspires to liberate Russia from the shackles of Soviet tyranny. May God be our guide, and may Russia be set free!"
uch.310.a: "Cossacks shall stay united."

uch.4.t: "The Ural Conference"
uch.4.t2: "The [UCH.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Conference"
uch.4.d: "Today in [UCH.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], at a joint meeting of representatives of Cossack Hosts, a resolution was adopted on the convocation of the Supreme Cossack Circle of Russia (VKK).\n\nThe VKK will oversee the Cossack Hosts belonging to the Union and regulate their joint activities in order to achieve a common goal - the salvation of Russia. It was also decided at the Conference that one representative would be sent from each Cossack army belonging to the Union, who would sit on the Cossack Circle. Thus, the equality of each Cossack army will be guaranteed."
uch.4.a: "Notify the Hosts and await their representatives."

uch.5.t: "The Supreme Cossack Circle"
uch.5.d: "A couple of days ago in [UCH.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], at a joint meeting of representatives of Cossack Hosts, a resolution was adopted on the convocation of the Supreme Cossack Circle of Russia (VKK).\n\nThe VKK will oversee the Cossack Hosts belonging to the Union and regulate their joint activities in order to achieve a common goal - the salvation of Russia. It was also decided at the Conference that one representative would be sent from each Cossack army belonging to the Union, who would sit on the Cossack Circle. Thus, the equality of each Cossack army will be guaranteed."

uch.5.d42: "As for the Kuban Cossack Host, they are also in great need of two separate representatives, due to the internal factionalism between Chernomortsy and Lineitsy"
uch.5.d43: "The leader of the Lineitsy, however, argues that they also should send their representative, as they are no longer associated with the Kuban Cossack Host, which they claim has ceased to exist."
uch.5.d5: "$uch.5.d$\nDisputes arose in the Rada, as the Lineitsy stated that Kuban should send two representatives, one each from the Chermonortsy and from the Lineitsy, in order to guarantee the true equality of all Cossack Hosts, and so that the voices of the Lineitsy would also be heard."
uch.5.d51: "$uch.5.d$\nDisputes arose in the Rada, as the Chernomortsy stated that Kuban should send two representatives, one each from the Lineitsy and from the Chernomortsy, in order to guarantee the true equality of all Cossack Hosts, and so that the voices of the Chernomortsy would also be heard."
uch.5.a: "A great idea!"
uch.5.b: "Send our distinct terms to [UCH.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."

uch.6.t: "[FROM.GetName] Sends Their Proposal"
uch.6.d: "Surprisingly, not all Hosts agreed with the terms. We have received a delegation from [FROM.GetName], demanding special terms for their representation."
uch.6.d2: "$uch.6.d$\nThey argue that 3 representatives should be sent from their Cossack Host, since the Far Eastern Cossack Host includes representatives of three once separate Cossack Hosts - the Transbaikal, Amur and Ussuri."

uch.6.d51: "$uch.6.d$\nThey argue that due to the internal factionalism between them and the Black Sea Host (Chernomortsy), which: also part of the Kuban Host, they should send 2 representatives."
uch.6.a: "Alright..."
uch.6.b: "That would seriously affect equality of the VKK."

uch.7.t: "They Agree!"
uch.7.d: "Fortunately, the terms of our delegation to [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] were accepted, granting us additional seats in the Supreme Cossack Circle."
uch.7.a: "Great!"

uch.8.t: "They Refuse!"
uch.8.d: "Unfortunately, the terms of our delegation to [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] were rejected, leaving us without additional seats in the Supreme Cossack Circle."
uch.8.a: "That's a disaster!"

uch.9.t: "A Nation of Cossacks"
uch.9.d: "For centuries, the Cossacks have been regarded as undeniably Russian, a class of military men in the service of the Tsar of Russia. However, in recent years, influenced by the Ukrainian Free Cossack and Hetmanist movement and the state apparatus established by Ataman Krasnov on the Don, the view that Cossacks constitute a distinct people has gained prominence, reflecting their unique origins and status.\n\nDespite attempts by the treacherous Bolsheviks to de-Cossack us — in essence, to eradicate us as a people — it is evident that we are a distinct group, with significant differences from the typical representation of the East Slavic peasantry, who cultivate the land.\n\nDespite the fact that this is a contentious issue, the leadership of the Union of Cossack Hosts initiated the exploration of the subject of Cossack nationalism with the aim of bolstering the morale and spirit of the officers who are not fighting against their kin, but against traitors to Russia. Only we, the Cossacks, as a distinct and unique people, possess the ability to liberate Russia from the corruption that the peasants and workers brought with them under the false banner of social 'liberation'."
uch.9.a: "Yes, but can we truly exist without Russia?"
uch.9.b: "Cossacks have truly deserved it!" #special for KUB

uch.10.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Claims All-Russian Leadership"
uch.10.d: "Today, the representatives of [FROM.GetNameDef] has announced all the members of the Joint Cossack Front about [FROM.GetLeader]'s decision to form the all-Russian government, claiming the supreme leadership over Russia."
uch.10.a: "And we support their decision."
uch.10.b: "But we thought we fought for Motherland, not power..."
uch.11.d: "Today, the news came from [FROM.Capital.GetName] that the government of [FROM.GetLeader] claims to be the only legitimate and supreme government over all of Russia, directly threatening us and showing that they are unwilling to cooperate."
uch.11.a: "Another traitor who split our people!"

uch.12.t: "Supreme Ruler of Russia"
uch.12.d: "The so-called Moscow State Conference, which took place in the capital today, saw the announcement by the government of the Supreme Cossack Circle that it would take full supreme authority throughout Russia. The participants came to the consensus that it was imperative to "concentrate military and civilian power in the hands of a single individual with significant influence in military and societal circles." As a result, Ataman [ROOT.GetLeader] was unanimously designated as the Supreme Ruler of Russia.\n\nThe authority of the Supreme Ruler closely mirrors the so-called November 18 Constitution, which governed the powers of Admiral Kolchak, with the notable exception that this constitution limited the separation of powers owing to the absence of a parliament, concentrating legislative and executive authority in the hands of the Supreme Ruler and their Council of Ministers. Moreover, the Supreme Ruler possessed the absolute veto power.\n\nA striking divergence from the previous order of things was the fact that the novel regulations, meticulously crafted by the Moscow State Conference, were not merely temporary measures, but rather permanent fixtures. However, in a separate provision, the Conference endorsed the continuation (or revival) of local democratic institutions such as city dumas, Cossack Circles, and village soviets, as well as the zemstvo system. Nonetheless, on the national level, there would be no parliamentary assembly convened to maintain state stability. The supreme ruler would retain their position indefinitely."
uch.12.a: "Glory to the Supreme Ruler!"

uch.13.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Influence Increases!"
uch.13.d: "Recently, the leadership of the All-Cossack administration has made considerable efforts to garner the support of our Cossack community and the entire Host. Their influence: so pervasive that it threatens to overshadow our own autonomy. While deeper integration may be advantageous for the common goal,: our Ataman willing to concede this point?"
uch.13.a: "We're glad to accept their help!"
uch.13.b: "We are not giving up our sovereignty!"

uch.14.t: "Successful Integration!"
uch.14.d: "Owing to the enhanced influence on [FROM.GetAdjective] governmental affairs, we have been able to assert control over their governing body, namely the Cossack Circle and the Ataman. Having secured a majority, we now exercise control over their administration."
uch.14.a: "We're becoming more united!"

uch.15.t: "Failed Integration!"
uch.15.d: "Regrettably, our endeavours to exert more stringent oversight over [FROM.GetAdjective] Cossack Circle have proven futile — our designs have been thwarted, and their forces now regard us with mistrust."
uch.15.a: "That might be a problem in the future."

#uch.16-17 same
uch.18.a: "Integrate them with force!"

uch.19.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Is Proclaimed Supreme Ruler of Russia"
uch.19.d: "It is a curious fact that yesterday, Ataman [FROM.GetLeader], who had only recently boldly proclaimed his government to be the sole legitimate one in Russia, and who subsequently rose to the pinnacle of glory and power following the liberation of the ancient Kremlin by his loyal Cossacks, was swiftly elevated to the position of Supreme Ruler by a hastily assembled \"Moscow Conference\".\n\nNo one had ever before dared to take such audacious action. Even Admiral Kolchak, who staged a coup in 1918 and also claimed the title of Supreme Ruler, understood the transient nature of his office and did not view it as a divine ordination.\n\nHowever, the deed has been done, and now Ataman [FROM.GetLeader], seated on the \"throne\" of this new, republican Russia, claims the role of a de facto leader. How should we interpret this development?"
uch.19.a: "His Cossacks demonstrated remarkable courage in battle, and he merited this position!"
uch.19.b: "A traitor to Russia, one who betrayed his homeland for his own selfish interests!"

uch.20.t: "The Ukrainian Free Cossacks"
uch.20.d: "One of the crucial matters that, in [ROOT.GetLeader]'s view, the Supreme Cossack Council ought to address is the question of the Free Cossacks — a paramilitary organisation that emerged in Ukraine in 1917. However, this issue is intricately connected to the extent to which the Cossack Circles of our members are willing to recognise the Ukrainian Cossacks and Ukraine as autonomous entities.\n\nOn the one hand, the Free Cossacks arose as an anti-Bolshevik force aimed at maintaining public order. On the other hand, they openly strive to \"defend the liberty of the Ukrainian people\".\n\nUnder the influence of Ivan Poltavets-Ostryanitsa, a prominent figure of Ukrainian nationalism, this organization not only became one of the cornerstones of the «Ukrainian Hetmanate» regime, but also asserted its primacy and the restoration of the Ukrainian Cossacks as the sole foundation of the entire Cossack movement. They claim, in essence, that Cossacks are Ukrainians, or, at the very least, two closely related concepts.\n\nNot everyone is willing to support the idea of inviting the Free Cossacks into our union, yet it is possible that an alliance with Ukraine could be crucial in our shared endeavor to liberate all of Russia."
uch.20.a: "We need more allies."
uch.20.b: "We don't recognize these 'Ukrainian' cossacks!"

uch.21.t: "Formalizing Our Ties?"
uch.21.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has suggested us to increase our cooperation and join their military alliance in order to liberate Russia."
uch.21.a: "We're in!"
uch.21.b: "We're out!"

uch.22.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
uch.22.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to join arms with us!"
uch.22.a: "Pathetic..."

uch.23.t: "Case of Socialists and Revolutionaries"
uch.23.d: "The recent meeting of the Council of Ministers, presided over by the Supreme Ruler, has been convened to deliberate on the future course of action regarding the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Despite its significant contributions to the cause of revolutionary democracy, there is no denying the fact that the Socialist-Revolutionaries were instrumental in instigating revolutionary terror, at least since the early part of the century.\n\nThe Council of Ministers' particular concern lies in the openly anti-Cossack elements present in the party's platform and its activities in the immediate aftermath of the first civil war, which effectively contributed to the rise of the Kolchak regime in the Far-East and exacerbated social divisions within Russia. Additionally, the failure of Kerensky's ill-fated \"SR\" reforms is also a matter of grave concern.\n\nThe Council of Ministers further deliberated on the issue of right-wing radicals, specifically focusing on Boris Savinkov and his followers within the NRPR movement. According to some members of the council, these individuals are also implicated in acts of terror, contributing to the current revolutionary climate and other criminal activities.\n\nThere are two distinct approaches to address this situation. One proposal calls for a comprehensive ban on all parties affiliated with the Socialist Revolutionary Party, encompassing not only the NRPR but also revolutionary parties in general. This measure is intended to safeguard the interests of the people and prevent further unrest. However, there is concern that such a move may have unintended consequences, potentially destabilizing the current situation and potentially triggering a fresh wave of unrest.\n\nConversely, some more moderate representatives advocate for tighter control over trade unions, village councils, and other \"undesirable elements\", advocating for a government-sanctioned \"Russian People's Party\" to exercise oversight."
uch.23.a: "Ban any leftist or revolutionary!"
uch.23.b: "We need people under control."

uch.24.t: "A New Pillar of the Regime?"
uch.24.d: "The new order of things and the elevation of the Supreme Ruler have caused particular discontent not only among our adversaries, the socialists and revolutionaries, but also among those who appeared to be loyal to the regime, namely, the liberals and the conservatives.\n\nThe Kadets, who once supported Kolchak's dictatorial rule and authority, as well as the conservatives, primarily monarchists, denounced the decision made at the State Conference in Moscow to refrain from establishing the Russian Duma and instead limit themselves to «local democracy». Many of the city dumas and zemstvos, which traditionally served as the liberals' stronghold, are now leaning towards them. However, this decision cannot be reversed.\n\nNeither the liberals nor the conservatives advocate for any form of violence or even non-violent protests, but their dissent will become more evident in the future. Divide et impera, is it not?\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers proposed that [ROOT.GetLeader] should seek support from one of two factions, the Liberals or the Conservatives, and engage in negotiations with them regarding concessions they would be willing to support us in exchange for. In the event of an alliance with the Liberals, there is no alternative but to further empower local authorities, while an alliance with the Conservatives would require substantial investments in business and the further integration of prominent industrialists and entrepreneurs into the state apparatus."
uch.24.a: "Liberals are the mainstay of the new Russia."
uch.24.b: "The Old Order dictates us to ally the conservatives."

uch.25.t: "Elections to the New Constituent Assembly"
uch.25.d: "Today, the transitional government of Russia has officially announced that the elections to the forthcoming constituent assembly will take place in two months' time, with the aim of ultimately restoring peace, stability, and prosperity to the nation.\n\nFollowing the recent tumultuous events, many political parties are now recovering and preparing to field their candidates. However, it is clear to all that the Cossack movement will not permit these elections to proceed in any manner that poses a threat to their interests."
uch.25.a: "Let us hope another election won't ruin the country."

uch.26.t: "Question of the Left Parties"
uch.26.d: "One of the critical issues that our transitional government continues to address is the question of left political parties. It has been unanimously determined that the parties that took part in the revolutionary events have no right to be reinstated — primarily, this applies to the so-called Popular Front. Trade unions, village soviets, factory committees, and other revolutionary organizations were also included in this decision. However, special attention was paid to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which did not participate in the Popular Front but remains a left-wing force, albeit on the far-left fringe, in the context of contemporary Russia.\n\nMoreover, it was the so-called Right SRs that was responsible for the Kolchak coup and the widespread discontent among the Cossacks, who firmly believe that the SRs would deprive them of their rights. These events must never be allowed to occur again.\n\nSome argue that cooperation with certain Socialist Revolutionaries may be permissible for the sake of maintaining overall stability in the nation, provided that all necessary measures are taken to safeguard the power of the military and the Cossack community. However, others maintain that no concessions should be made, and left-wing parties should be entirely eradicated."
uch.26.a: "Cooperate with them, but in our best interests."
uch.26.b: "Without any doubt - ban, ban, ban!"

uch.27.t: "Fate of the NRPR"
uch.27.d: "One of the most prominent parties of the interwar period was undoubtedly the People's Republican Party, founded by Savinkov, a former socialist revolutionary and terrorist. It quickly emerged as a significant political force, attracting numerous nationalist elements within the country. However, shortly before the ultimate victory of our government, this party disintegrated, and Savinkov vanished from the scene.\n\nDespite this setback, many nationalists remain divided and discontented. We, as representatives of the nationalist movement, are committed to addressing their grievances. We do not condone their aspirations for power, but rather propose the establishment of a new party that can unite right-wing elements in our nation, including those who were once affiliated with the NRPR."
uch.27.a: "Russia's nationalists must find a new foothold."
uch.27.b: "Leave them alone."

uch.28.t: "Cossacks Lobby The Monarchy"
uch.28.d: "The prospect of restoring the monarchy has assumed an unexpected degree of significance in the forthcoming Constituent Assembly. To begin with, a substantial portion of Cossack factions vehemently advocate for the restoration of monarchy, actively promoting this vision in concert with conservative monarchists and right-leaning liberals. They are confident that their prospects for success in these elections are promising, particularly if our government adopts an actively monarchist stance.\n\nHowever, on the contrary, the republic remains the sole viable option for the continued existence of our nation, despite the tumultuous circumstances."
uch.28.a: "The monarchy has fallen and will never rise again."
uch.28.b: "Without the Tsar, Russia will not return to the path of stability."

uch.29.t: "Concerns About Federal Structure"
uch.29.d: "The transitional government has been paying particular attention to the matter of the federal structure of the state, which was adopted at the preceding constituent assembly. During that time, left-leaning democrats and socialists strongly advocated for this decision, achieving a significant majority. However, their influence has waned, with those who advocate for a united and indivisible Russia gaining increasing power. This presents us with a critical choice — but are we prepared to alienate those minorities we aspire to incorporate into our vision of Greater Russia?"
uch.29.a: "Russia is one and indivisible."
uch.29.b: "Russia is a federation under guidance of the Russian people."

uch.30.t: "The Executive Authority"
uch.30.d: "The question of executive authority has recently preoccupied the minds of those being elected to the Constituent Assembly. The idea of placing a single individual at the helm of such a vast and diverse nation inevitably raises concerns about tyranny, dictatorship, and the necessity for parliamentary oversight over the presidency — similar to the provisions of the Russian Constitution of 1920, albeit with a stronger emphasis on parliamentary checks and balances.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a perception that parliaments can be inherently unstable and difficult to control, driven by the pursuit of power. Such a decision is not without its challenges."
uch.30.a: "Sole authority will only be detrimental to the nation."
uch.30.b: "Only the authority of a single individual, subject to parliamentary oversight, can save Russia."

uch.31.t: "The Third Constituent Assembly"
uch.31.d: "And now, the Third Constituent Assembly draws to a close. The elected delegates have reached all the crucial decisions, and this time, no turbulence shall mar Russia. We must carry the resolutions of the Constituent Assembly proudly and commence the process of constructing a new Russia."
uch.31.a: "Long live the Russian Empire!" #monarchy
uch.31.b: "Long live the Russian Federative Republic!" #federal
uch.31.c: "Long live the Russian State!" #unitary

uch.32.t: "The New Russian Tsar"
uch.32.d: "The Romanov dynasty came to an untimely and unjust end, its demise marked by moral depravity, legal impropriety, and illegitimate means. Yet, despite the best efforts of the advocates of chaos and the malevolent forces of the Bolshevik regime, there remain those who uphold the noble lineage of this imperial line, and it is incumbent upon our government, operating under the authority of the Regency Council, to select a new sovereign."

KR_Bharatiya_Commune: "Bharatiya Focus Tree"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_LALA_LAJPAT_RAI_DESC: "Lala Lajpat Rai, Punjabi Hindu philanthropist, returned from championing Indian independence in the United States to formulate the creation of a new socialist state in India. With the collapse of British rule in late 1925, Rai, along with other Indian socialist figureheads, proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Bengal. While the People's Republic initially failed to unite India through force, it managed to consolidate its rule over the northeastern third of the sub-continent. Rai, once relatively secure in his leadership of the People's Republic, renamed the Bharatiya Commune to indicate its ambition of unification, now faces spirited opposition from competing socialist factions. With his advanced age and waning influence, Rai has announced his intent to resign from his post. His successor may well determine the future of the Commune itself."
POLITICS_FAZLUL_HUQ_DESC: "Fazlul Huq, former secretary of the Bengali Muslim League, and now an avowed Syndicalist, has led his 'Moderate' faction to victory in the Indian National Congress's special session. He campaigned on a platform of trade-union centric industrialisation and the gradual implementation of socialist reform. Despite electoral success, however, Fuq still faces staunch opposition from opposing factions of the Indian National Congress. Regardless, Fuq's vision of prosperity in the historically impoverished eastern India, and perhaps one day the entire sub-continent, appears, at least to his supporters, to be increasingly achievable."
POLITICS_CHANDRA_BOSE_DESC: "As a boy, Subhas Chandra Bose once assaulted a British schoolmaster for defaming his beloved India; his expulsion thereafter left Bose with an almost rabid desire for vengeance. Shortly before the collapse of the British Raj, Bose attracted large swaths of the Indian population to the socialist cause with incendiary speeches against the all who would deny India's people sole dominion over the sub-continent. With the success of Bose's Maximists within the Indian National Congress, the Bharatiya Commune as a whole has begun to assume a similarly militaristic outlook; it now looks to strike a decisive blow to the hearts of the Dominionists and Princely Federation alike."
POLITICS_MOHANDAS_GHANDI_DESC: "A former lawyer, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi valued highly the gradual, peaceful, and lawful independence of India from British rule. With the collapse of the Raj, however, he and his many followers were forced to reassess their position. Though still a proponent of pacifism, Ghandi has become increasingly influenced by the ideas of his colleagues in the now radicalised Indian National Congress. Ghandi's victory in the Indian National Congress's special session has awoken renewed hope for the peaceful reunification of the Indian sub-continent and the reconciliation of its divided factions."
POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC: "Jawaharlal Nehru is almost certainly the most tactful of the Bharatiya Commune's prominent political leaders. With the collapse of the British Raj, Nehru, while a staunch advocate for immediate independence from the weakened Empire, worked tireless to mediate all manner of disputes among Indian leaders across the political spectrum. While his detractors would slander Nehru as indecisive and cowardly, Nehru's subtle political manoeuvring was essential for his ascension to the highest levels of the Indian National Congress, and now the Bharatiya Commune itself. Under Nehru's leadership, perhaps the factionalism which has plagued the Congress for decades may finally be assuaged."
POLITICS_NIRMAL_KUMAR_BOSE_DESC: "Nirmal Kumar Bose, protégé of the famous Mohandas Gandhi, has assumed leadership of the Bharatiya Commune. He is likely to continue the agrarian reforms of Ghandi, and encourage the non-violent reunification of India. Many dissidents within the Bharatiya Commune, however, are displeased with Bose's rise to power, believing, despite official explanations to the contrary, that Bose masterminded Ghandi's demise."
POLITICS_SHRIPAD_AMRIT_DANGE_DESC: "Shripad Amrit Dange is perhaps the most radical syndicalist within the Indian National Congress. Much like Nestor Makhno of the French Anarchistes, he advocates the eventual disestablishment of the very state itself. Unlike the Anarchistes however, rather than promoting rural collectivisation, Dange advocates industrialisation and the assumption by trade unions of the entire economic apparatus."

### Ideas ###

BHC_backwards_economy_1_desc: "The nation is largely agrarian in nature, with many of its agricultural methods long outdated."

BHC_divided_government: "Divided Government"
BHC_divided_government_desc: "There are three factions within the Calcutta government: the Maximists, the Moderates, and the Agrarians. Each fought together during the civil war, but each has their own goals and their own vision of what a socialist India will become, even if they are all part of the same government. The in-fighting can, at times, become extreme, and there are worries that the division may eventually lead to open conflict."

### Focuses ###
BHC_INC_Meeting_1: "Special Meeting of the INC"
BHC_INC_Meeting_1_desc: "With Lala Lajpat Rai's term coming to an end, all of Calcutta is buzzing with excitement prior to the convening of the Indian National Congress. There it is expected a new head of state will be appointed, determining the direction of the Bharatiya Commune over the next few critical years."
BHC_totalist_1: "Subhas Chandra Bose"
BHC_totalist_1_desc: "Subhas Chandra Bose, leader of the Maximist faction, has won the appointment as the head of the Calcutta government."
BHC_speech_war: "'We Will Not Be Defeated'"
BHC_speech_war_desc: "The first order of business for Bose will be to address the nation - the Totalists are expected to take a harsh line when it comes to the Commune's advancement over the next several years. To Bose, the Bharatiya Commune has the capability of advancing its own interests and modernising its military, without dependence on outside forces, but only at incredible cost."
BHC_revoke_landlords: "Revoke the Landlords"
BHC_revoke_landlords_desc: "Not all the landlords common to India before the revolution are gone. Indeed, many of the smaller farms are still held by wealthy members of the upper castes who believe themselves untouchable by the Calcutta government. The Maximists intend to prove to them this is not so, and all of the nation's farmlands must come under a common rule and administration by the people who work on them."
BHC_nationalize_industry: "Organise Vital Industries"
BHC_nationalize_industry_desc: "While most of the nation's vital industries are nationalised, they yet remain in a sorry condition from the devastation of the civil war. The government must concentrate on restoring their productivity and organising their management so as to provide the military the support it desperately needs."
BHC_mass_conscription: "Rouse the Masses"
BHC_mass_conscription_desc: "The call must go out to the people of the Bharatiya Commune: prepare for war. Each and every man and woman must be ready to fight against the forces of colonialism and oppression, and if the price of that sacrifice is high then it must be gladly paid. India's freedom shall come with the shedding of blood, there is no way around it, but the majority of it shall not be the Commune's."
BHC_purge_army: "Begin the Purge"
BHC_purge_army_desc: "Too many of the officers in the Commune's army were once princes of the old order, or have a questionable loyalty to the Commune. We cannot afford the risk that they will balk in the face of the demands which will come, and thus they must be purged from the ranks. The price will be severe, but it is a necessary risk."
BHC_rebuild_army: "A New Army Arises"
BHC_rebuild_army_desc: "With the purge of the army completed, it is time to replace what was lost - and ensure that all the officers promoted are loyal to the Maximist cause."
BHC_ready_people: "Total War is Upon Us"
BHC_ready_people_desc: "The loyalty of the Commune's people must be guaranteed - and it is not only a loyalty towards the nation, but to the Maximists. Ours is a hard road to walk, but we cannot afford the chance that those who call themselves 'moderates' or 'peacemakers' will stay our hand when decisiveness is what is called for."
BHC_syndicalist_1: "A. K. Fazlul Huq"
BHC_syndicalist_1_desc: "A. K. Fazlul Huq, leader of the Moderates faction, has won the appointment as the head of the Calcutta government."
BHC_speech_industry: "'Industry is the Path to Victory'"
BHC_speech_industry_desc: "The first order of business with be for Huq and Nehru to address the nation - the Moderates are expected to take a realistic and gradual approach to the nation's advancement, focusing on its industrial growth and the reform of unjust policies to spur on the speed of social change. To many in the nation, this will be received with nothing short of a sigh of relief."
BHC_spread_revolution: "Spread the Revolution"
BHC_spread_revolution_desc: "Moderate attitudes to growth do not mean a surrender to the forces of colonialism and oppression which yet remain arrayed against the Commune. Towards that end, it is necessary for the government to reach out to those revolutionaries in the north and west who quietly remain, ready to act on a moment's notice."
BHC_create_raw: "The Research and Analysis Wing"
BHC_create_raw_desc: "Knowledge is our greatest weapon - knowledge of what our enemies are doing, and the ability to deceive them with misinformation. Towards that end, a new wing of the military shall be funded which will increase our intelligence capabilities throughout the sub-continent and beyond."
BHC_production_focus: "Focus on Production"
BHC_production_focus_desc: "As part of the Moderates' plan to spur on the Commune's industrial growth, several population centres have been earmarked to receive an influx of cash and construction."
BHC_technology_focus: "Focus on Technology"
BHC_technology_focus_desc: "The Moderates say that volume is not as important as quality - the Bharatiya Commune must focus on its technology above all else, making it the equal of the most advanced parts of the western world. It is the only path to victory."
BHC_arm_soldiers: "Arm the Soldiers"
BHC_arm_soldiers_desc: "The Commune has a large army, but equipping so many soldiers is a difficult task and one that will require a great deal of coordination and planning."
BHC_seek_aid: "Invite Great Minds from Abroad"
BHC_seek_aid_desc: "We cannot work alone - if we are to achieve true heights of research and technology, we must invite the brightest minds from socialist nations around the world to work closely with our scientists."
BHC_socialist_1: "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi"
BHC_socialist_1_desc: "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, leader of the Agrarians faction, has won the appointment as the head of the Calcutta government."
BHC_speech_peace: "'There is a Path to Peace for India'"
BHC_speech_peace_desc: "The first order of business with be for Gandhi to address the nation - he is expected to declare that the Bharatiya Commune is not ruled by warlords, but rather by a government that intends to put the people and their freedom above all else. The Mahatma is a revered figure in India, and the people will be elated to hear his words."
BHC_path_of_defense: "Focus on Defence"
BHC_path_of_defense_desc: "One of the principles of freedom is strength - even with the Agrarians in charge of the Commune, there are yet forces who see only enemies and will not hesitate to strike should they get the chance. The Agrarians will call on the people to resist, to support the government and its efforts with all their strength, and to rest assured that the Mahatma will guide them on the path to peace and freedom."
BHC_people_first: "The People of India First"
BHC_people_first_desc: "One of the Agrarians' priorities is to see to the welfare of India's poorest. It will require a sacrifice on the part of the government to see them elevated, but in Gandhi's own words the Commune cannot achieve victory without these desperate souls."
BHC_home_guard: "Create the Home Guard"
BHC_home_guard_desc: "Sadly, peace with the Princely Federation and the Delhi government will never be achieved through words alone. They will not listen to reason. Thus it is necessary to found a new faction within the Commune's army, one that is focused on defence as well as maintaining the peace. If the traitors of the north and west come, they must be met with stern resistance and know that we will take our pound of flesh if we must."
BHC_approach_enemy: "Approach the Enemy in Peace"
BHC_approach_enemy_desc: "It is possible that reunion with the other factions in India could be achieved. Most important is the government in Delhi - if they will listen to the Mahatma's words and agree to a summit, one without their British masters in attendance, then the Princely Federation will follow. Whether such an achievement is even possible remains to be seen."
BHC_reunite_india: "Begin the Lucknow Summit"
BHC_reunite_india_desc: "The Delhi and Calcutta governments have agreed to a summit in Lucknow, with the slimmest of chances that it might result in peaceful union. There are forces already stirring within the Commune in stark opposition to this plan, but the Mahatma believes it can be done...and, if peace is possible, then it must be done."
BHC_reform_army: "Reform the Commune's Army"
BHC_reform_army_desc: "Establishing the Home Guard is not enough. There are forces already stirring within the Commune's army which worry of the Agrarians' growing influence, and continue to push the nation towards war with the north and west even if the Mahatma is determined that the Commune not make the first move. They must be found and their support removed, even if it provokes the Maximists in Calcutta."
BHC_end_the_debate: "End the National Debate"
BHC_end_the_debate_desc: "While there will always be conflicts within the Calcutta government, it is time to draw the constant in-fighting to an end. If the Bharatiya Commune is to unite India, it must be done will all three factions hand in hand and working towards a common goal."
BHC_new_industry: "The New Industries"
BHC_new_industry_desc: "The state of our industry is lacking. We should concentrate our efforts on researching new designs for our factories."
BHC_railroad_1: "Expand the National Railroad"
BHC_railroad_1_desc: "Expanding the Commune's infrastructure is the first step towards rebuilding our economy and continuing our industrial growth."
BHC_railroad_2: "Further Expand the National Railroad"
BHC_railroad_2_desc: "The nation's infrastructure must continue to expand, as the first step towards our national recovery."
BHC_mining: "Expand the National Mines"
BHC_mining_desc: "The Bharatiya Commune is blessed with natural resources, and we must embrace new methods of mining in order to exploit them."
BHC_assam_oil: "Oil in Assam"
BHC_assam_oil_desc: "Recent explorations in the frontier provinces of Assam have revealed untapped oil deposits. India will never be one of the world's great oil producers, but this may yet prove to be a vital resource for our army and industry."
BHC_indian_elites: "The Question of Bengal's Elites"
BHC_indian_elites_desc: "One of the hindrances to the Commune's progress lies in the remnants of the old social order which yet lingers - the elite castes are not as wealthy or as powerful as they once were, but even so they hold onto what they have and refuse to share their excess with the people and the government. We must decide what measures will be taken to bring them into line, if it is even possible, before we can begin to truly grow."
BHC_civ_industry_1: "Build Civilian Industry"
BHC_civ_industry_1_desc: "Armed with new technologies, we can start building factories across our nation."
BHC_civ_industry_2: "Continue Building Civilian Industry"
BHC_civ_industry_2_desc: "We must continue to build civilian factories, to provide for our people."
BHC_mil_industry_1: "Build Military Industry"
BHC_mil_industry_1_desc: "Our military factories are currently lacking. We must dedicate our political efforts to expanding them."
BHC_mil_industry_2: "Continue Building Military Industry"
BHC_mil_industry_2_desc: "While our military production has increased, it is not nearly at a level necessary to take on the northern Dominion and the Princely Federation. We must continue to expand it."
BHC_new_economy: "The Economy Renewed!"
BHC_new_economy_desc: "At long last, we have restored the damage to our economy from the civil war and may now truly claim to be a rising industrial power, ready to take on our enemies."
BHC_army_research: "The Department of Research"
BHC_army_research_desc: "It is time to construct a department within the armed forces, one which concentrates on advancing our research capabilities."
BHC_radio: "Develop Radio Technology"
BHC_radio_desc: "Radio technology has proven elsewhere in the world to be a marvel which allows for instant communication with the army's front line. We must work towards its mastery."
BHC_electronics_1: "Develop Electronics"
BHC_electronics_1_desc: "The advent of radar and computers is essential to the Commune's future military efforts."
BHC_expand_research: "Expand our Research Teams"
BHC_expand_research_desc: "Too many other parts of the world are outpacing our scientists. We must gather more scientists and put them to work on our behalf, to meet the coming challenges."
BHC_rocketry: "Develop Rocket Technology"
BHC_rocketry_desc: "With India reunited, we must embrace the future of warfare: rockets that can not only power our aircraft, but which can propel the most destructive of weapons."
BHC_nuclear: "The Future of Warfare"
BHC_nuclear_desc: "There is a secret plan within the darkest parts of the Calcutta government, one which seeks to master the most powerful weapon known to mankind. With this in our hands, any victory is possible."
BHC_central_command: "Establish our Central Command"
BHC_central_command_desc: "There are too many separate commands, based on the various revolutionary groups which fought in the civil war. We must bring them together under one banner, and move forward as a single force."
BHC_army_command: "The New Bharatiya Army"
BHC_army_command_desc: "Our ground forces must be a new priority, promoting those generals who can bring the greatest benefit and reforming their methods for the sake of the nation."
BHC_increase_training: "Establish Training Academies"
BHC_increase_training_desc: "New training academies are required - we must train a great number of soldiers, and quickly, if we are to ever hope for victory against our enemies."
BHC_mobility: "Mobility Focus"
BHC_mobility_desc: "Cavalry is no longer enough. We must focus on vehicle transport, and increase the mobility of our forces."
BHC_modernize_army: "Modernise the Army"
BHC_modernize_army_desc: "Indian infantrymen are numerous and loyal. Their equipment, however, is dated and inefficient. We must rectify this."
BHC_artillery_focus: "Modernise our Artillery"
BHC_artillery_focus_desc: "The Commune's artillery mostly dates from the Weltkrieg. We must modernise our artillery unless we wish our soldiers to be eviscerated without proper support."
BHC_armored_corps_1: "The Bharatiya Armoured Corps"
BHC_armored_corps_1_desc: "Providing our troops with armoured vehicles will give us a distinct edge in facing off against our enemies."
BHC_armored_corps_2: "Expand the Bharatiya Armoured Corps"

BHC_adv_command_1: "Rule the Ground"
BHC_adv_command_1_desc: "Our primary focus is on our army - yes, this may come at the expense of our navy and air capabilities, but the Commune must recognise where its strength lies and maximise its effectiveness."
BHC_air_command: "Establish the Air Branch"
BHC_air_command_desc: "Nothing remains of the meagre air force the Commune wielded during the Weltkrieg. We must rebuild it from scratch, and this begins with the establishment of a new air command."
BHC_air_training: "The Cuttack Air Academy"
BHC_air_training_desc: "The first step in rebuilding our air force is the creation of an air academy, one which can train our future airmen for the battles to come."

BHC_airborne: "Establish the Red Lions Air Corps"

BHC_navy_command: "Establish the Naval Command"

BHC_destroyer_focus: "Destroyer Focus"
BHC_destroyer_focus_desc: "Destroyers are effective at destroying enemy submarines. We should ensure our shipping is safe by constructing as many of these as possible."
BHC_red_marines: "Establish the Bharatiya Marines"
BHC_red_marines_desc: "One proposal within the government would have us concentrate not on defending ourselves from sea assault, but in establishing a force of marines capable of attacking the coasts of our enemies. It is an interesting idea, and one that has merit if our fleet is worthy enough to support it."
BHC_protect_coasts: "Protect the Commune's Coasts"
BHC_protect_coasts_desc: "Our focus must be on defending our vital ports, and to that end we must erect fortresses on the coast to ensure they can be protected from seaborne attack."

BHC_anglo_indian_trade: "The Anglo-Indian Trade Agreement"
BHC_anglo_indian_trade_desc: "A proposal has been presented aimed at systematising and streamlining the socialist Anglo-Indian cooperation - granting the Indian government vital assistance in industrial and martial matters whilst securing the people and government of Britain a steady flow of exotic goods such as bananas, rubber and - most importantly - unrestricted access to the tea plantations of Assam."

BHC_delhi_rebellion: "Socialists of the North Unite!"
BHC_delhi_rebellion_desc: "Simply attacking the north may not be enough - it may be risky, but we could also contact socialist elements within the Dominion and get them to rise up even as we attack. It would raise the possibility of Dominion forces being harassed behind their own lines.

### Events ###
beng.1.t: "Lala Lajpat Rai and the Calcutta Government"
beng.1.d: "Lala Lajpat Rai, president of the Indian National Congress and head of the Calcutta government, has begun to feel the strain of his advanced age creeping ever nearer. With the British lapdogs in Delhi re-emerging as a serious contender to the mantle of the Raj's legal successor and the Burmese monarchy rattled by student protests and strikes, Rai has concluded that the government of free India will have to be refitted and reorganised if we are to keep up with the development of our neighbouring rivals - and as such he has decided to step down from his position within the year. Rai's resignation marks a potential end to the compromise government that emerged after the Indian Civil War, with both Gandhi's Agrarians and Subhas Chandra Bose's Maximists longing for definitive influence within Congress and the Calcutta government as a whole."
beng.1.a: "I must say, this is awfully exciting!"
beng.2.t: "Special Session of the Indian National Congress"
beng.2.d: "Calcutta is steaming with excitement in the face of the [GetYear] Special Session of the Indian National Congress and the red flag flutters boldly from Writers' Building to the General Post Office. Inside the Calcutta High Court, the collected leadership of our republic's government has convened for the ensuing election of Lala Lajpat Rai's successor. It is expected that the appointment of a new head of state will mean a change within the nation's cabinet, prompting the various factions to vie for the most influence in all the various commissaries and committees that manage our country. Three wings have emerged within Congress: Bose's Maximists emulate Mosley's British Totalitarian Socialism and regard military force as a necessary revolutionary act for India's unification while Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi leads a pacifist, egalitarian and agrarian wing - striving for a negotiated end to the subcontinent's fragmentation. Standing between the two extremes is a coalition of trade unionists and ardent proponents of industrialism led by A. K. Fazlul Huq and his young protege, Jawaharlal Nehru. As the opening speeches begin to ring across the floor, the [GetYear] Special Session seems bound to change the path of free India in the next years."
beng.2.a: "Internal fraction must be quelled!"
beng.3.t: "Bose Denounces Landlordism"
beng.3.d: "Although the greatest landowners and princes of Bengal and Orissa were deposed and their fiefs expropriated after the Calcutta government asserted itself in the years following 1926, the Bharatiya Commune never truly made the transformation into a socialist society. Lingering still in the villages and the smaller cities, the Zamindar system of the olden days continues to shape the days and lives of those who should have been lifted into prosperity by the glorious revolution almost a decade ago. Subhas Chandra Bose has taken the floor and delivered a crushing speech against this feudal instrument of oppression, demanding an immediate end to the privately owned great farms and mansions as well as their subjugation to complete state control. A sensitive issue, the debate on the rights of the remaining landlords has begun to spin out of control and a decision will have to be made."
beng.3.a: "He is right, this feudal practice must be eradicated!"
beng.3.b: "As per the moderates, let us only nationalise the grand estates."
beng.3.c: "Heed the Mahatma and allow private property to exist."
beng.4.t: "Jawaharlal Nehru Laments the State of Industry"
beng.4.d: "At the end of the first week of the Special Session, young Jawaharlal Nehru has taken the floor, arguing for a further increase in our nation's industrial output and greater economic control by the state. Opposed to this stands the Gandhian wing of Congress, determined as they are that the heart and soul of Mother India is not her great cities, but rather the Harlequinesque patchwork of rural villages from Cape Comorin to the Mouth of the Indus. Accordingly, they believe the influx of state support should flow instead into the countryside, developing the rice paddies and benefiting the average Indian. The Maximists, on the other hand, find both Nehru's and Gandhi's proposals far too limited in their scope and hopelessly unambitious. Instead, Bose's supporters argue the state is more than capable of undertaking expansion in both sectors, requiring, of course, that the government absolutely control these endeavours."
beng.4.a: "Industry and agriculture must both must be expanded, no matter the cost."
beng.4.b: "Nehru is right, industry must be our first priority."
beng.4.c: "The soul of India is her villages - focus on agriculture!"
beng.5.t: "The Mahatma Urges Unification"
beng.5.d: "The Bharatiya Commune has been at peace with her neighbours since the civil war, but with changes in Burma, Delhi and the gun-salute prince's federation unfolding at a unnerving pace, it is now obvious the special session will have to address the lingering question of unification. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, always a staunch opponent of violence, supports a negotiated end to the division of the subcontinent. Given how hard the revolutionaries had to fight during last days of the Raj, this stance is rather controversial and both Huq and Bose find the notion all but treacherous. Nehru argues that the government should wage realpolitik and take opportunities as they come, while Bose has bombastically announced neither the Nizam nor the Dominion shall obtain any concession."
beng.5.a: "Princes and lapdogs must be driven out at bayonet point!"
beng.5.b: "Unification is paramount, the methods used are not!"
beng.5.c: "Warfare is immoral, strive for a negotiated unification!"
beng.6.t: "The Session Endorses Bose's Maximists"
beng.6.d: "After much deliberation and exhausting debates, the Special Session of Congress has finally endorsed the platform proposed by Subhas Chandra Bose and his Maximists. The venerable war hero now ascends to absolute leadership within the Calcutta government, bringing with him a following of idealist and radicalised socialists. Gandhi is appalled at this blatant endorsement of violence and his left Calcutta for his ashram, giving Bose a benevolent audience for his acceptance speech. With the internal division now solved, our rivals around the continent will certainly have cause for worry!"
beng.6.a: "Let the ruling classes tremble!"
beng.7.t: "The Session Endorses Huq's Moderates"
beng.7.d: "Sweeping into office, A. K. Fazlul Huq and young Nehru have soundly defeated all opposition to their pragmatic line of realpolitik. With Congress behind them, the new government will be able to enforce realistic, just and revolutionary policies throughout India. Already, news of the election has spread into the interior of our small republic, prompting spontaneous celebrations in its many villages. From now on, our goal and objectives are clear-cut! Total unification at any price!"
beng.7.a: "Let the ruling classes tremble!"
beng.8.t: "The Session Endorses the Mahatma's Agrarians"
beng.8.d: "Prevailing against the extremist rantings of Bose and the dangerous warmongering of Fazlul Huq, the Great Soul, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, has finally established a solid majority government in Calcutta. Hoping that his quest for peace throughout India now will commence, Gandhi has definitely seized control of all major offices within the cabinet. Hopefully, unification and swaraj will now arrive momentarily!"
beng.8.a: "Together, in unity!"
beng.9.t: "The Session Ends in a Stalemate!"
beng.9.d: "Despite long debates and late scheming in the corridors of power, no absolute victor has emerged from the special session of the Indian National Congress. Greatly frustrating to the ageing Lala Lajpat Rai, who hoped to deliver the fate of Free India into secure hands, the venerable leader has completely resigned any influence in the bogged-down political metamorphosis. In his stead as mediator, both Bose and Gandhi frantically attempt to appeal to young Jawaharlal Nehru for support, at least creating some semblance of coalition."
beng.9.a: "Bose and Nehru agree on an electoral alliance!"
beng.9.b: "The Mahatma sways young Nehru to his side!"
beng.15.t: "The Question of India's Elites"
beng.15.d: "As economic recovery continues in [Root.GetNameDef], one issue we are repeatedly encountering is that of the cultural elites that remain even after the changes to the social order following the civil war. They have neither the influence nor wealth they once did, but they are not without resources - and it is not uncommon for the 'lower classes' to give them deference even when the law is in their favour. These elites often ignore laws requiring them to work with those they see beneath them, and hold onto precious resources even when they are required to give them up. Gaining compliance will be tricky, considering many of our citizens take a blind eye to their transgressions."
beng.15.a: "Force them to comply - by force if necessary!"
beng.15.b: "Offer incentives to the elites to work with the new order."
beng.15.c: "We need their resources - promote the willing to good positions."
beng.16.t: "Resistance of the Elites Ended"
beng.16.d.resistance: "Our programme to force the cultural elites to comply with national reforms has, after a great deal of resistance and many arrests, finally met with success."
beng.16.d.incentive: "Our programme to entice the cultural elites to comply with national reforms has, after a great deal of time and at considerable cost, finally met with success."
beng.16.d.promotion: "Our programme to cajole the cultural elites into supporting the national reforms has, after a great deal of time and at considerable cost, finally met with success."
beng.16.a: "Now economic reforms can continue!"
beng.17.t: "The Passing of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi"
beng.17.d: "Perhaps the greatest soul to walk the Earth since Christ is no more. The Mahatma passed away quietly in his sleep at the venerable age of 80. He is succeeded as leader of the Agrarian Wing by the young scholar Nirmal Kumar Bose."
beng.17.a: "Fare thee well."
beng.18.t: "The Passing of Rabindranath Tagore"
beng.18.d: "A staunch friend of Gandhi and quite possibly the greatest scholar-poet India has seen in hundreds of years passed away late last night surrounded by his grieving family. His place amongst the Agrarians has been taken by the eminent peasant leader Panjabrao Deshmukh."
beng.18.a: "He is now where the mind has no fear."
beng.19.t: "The Passing of Madame Cama"
beng.19.d: "One of the most diligent early Indian revolutionaries, Bhikhaiji Rustom Cama passed away today whilst recuperating from fever. Having unfurled the first Indian national flag at the Stuttgart International Socialist Conference in 1907, Madame Cama enjoyed great prestige amongst both domestic as well as international revolutionaries."
beng.19.a: "We shall march on! Until all of India is free!"
beng.20.t: "Nationalising the Yenangyaung Oil Fields"
beng.20.d: "The workers at the Yenangyaung Oil Fields were the primus motor of the recent Burmese revolution. Their strike against the capitalist system of robbery and oppression was what galvanised the latent dissatisfaction with the Konbaung dynasty into a full-scale uprising within both the military and the general populace. As the Burmese republic ascended to the Bharatiya Commune it now falls upon our government to determine how the means of production in Yenangyaung should be handled. The Anarcho-Syndicalist wing of the Indian National Congress argue that the local trade unions, being the true representatives of the local workers, ought to take full control of the oil fields. On the other hand, Bose's Maximists present a strong argument for complete state control and involvement in the day to day running of the plants. The government will have to make a clear decision to ensure the cooperation of our new Burmese comrades."
beng.20.a: "Initiate a full national takeover of the Oil Fields!"
beng.20.b: "Let the oil fields be run by the local trade unions."
beng.20.c: "Maintain the status quo."
beng.21.t: "Shripad Amrit Dange Reforms the Anushilan Samiti"
beng.21.d: "At a local labour meeting in Calcutta close by Writer's Building, Shripad Amrit Dange and several prominent veteran revolutionaries such as Atulkrishna Ghosh and M.N. Roy have proclaimed their intention to organise a truly syndicalist and militant revolutionary organisation within the dominant INC. Seeing both the Maximist and Agrarian wings as compromised and Fazlul Huq's Moderates as corrupt, the group hopes to contest for commissary and delegate positions on the next round of elections to the government. Invoking the name old name 'Anushilan Samiti' (meaning 'Self-Culture Association') the group strongly advocates the use of force to overthrow the Hyderabad and Delhi governments as well as an economic system based on anarcho-syndicalist policies of cooperative farming and union controlled industries."
beng.21.a: "Let's hope he aims those bombs at the reactionaries!"
beng.22.t: "Nehru's Coup Against Fazlul Huq"
beng.22.d: "At a preliminary meeting of the Moderates, Jawaharlal Nehru has openly challenged A. K. Fazlul Huq for leadership. The split comes as no surprise to the political observers of Calcutta as Nehru has grown more and more disillusioned by the Tiger's singular preferable treatment of the Bengal. Hungry for the power needed to transform India along his own radicalised Fabian lines, Nehru launched a scathing attack on the elder Huq's political dealings with Nehru-loyalists Lal Bahadur Shastri and Gulzarilal Nanda immediately following up with their own denouncements of the old weary course. Visibly shaken by the coup and clearly lacking support from the majority of the grouping, Huq grudgingly abdicated leadership of the clique in favour of Nehru, who then proceeded to purge anyone not voting in his favour."
beng.22.a: "Will this weaken or strengthen the Industrialists?"
beng.23.t: "A Most Cordial Letter to Mr. Mosley"
beng.23.d: "In London, Oswald Mosley has, alongside a great number of revolutionary European dignitaries, proclaimed a new socialist doctrine uniting the most extreme and militant left-wing personalities of the continent behind the idea of Totalitarian Socialism. With its belief in an economy controlled by the state, the total involvement of the revolutionary vanguard in internal affairs and the importance of the state in preserving Socialism, Mosley's new theses have greatly impressed Subhas Chandra Bose, the great martial hero of the Indian Revolution. However, Bose's enthusiasm for this coordination of revolutionary ideology has greatly worried his opponents within the Calcutta Government. Nevertheless, Bose now sends his regards and support for this new doctrine to Comrade Mosley, stressing the need for cooperation between Calcutta and London in the proletarian struggle for the dissolution of the Capitalist system of murder and robbery."
beng.23.a: "Maybe the Mahatma better watch out."
beng.24.t: "Subhas Chandra Bose Sends his Regards"
beng.24.d: "While the support of Mussolini and Valois cemented Mosley's new proletarian doctrine in Europe, news that the hero of the Indian Revolution, Subhas Chandra Bose, has endorsed the idea of Totalitarian Socialism really strengthened Mosley's appeal within the British Union. Bose, who almost crushed the imperialists in 1926, is almost seen as a idolised figure of the revolution in the Far East and, as such, his opinion is highly regarded by many. Regardless, the notion of India and Britain, united as proletarian brothers instead of colonial master and slave has caught the people's fancy."
beng.24.a: "India and Britain, revolutionary brothers!"
beng.40.t: "The Anglo-Indian Trade Agreement"
beng.40.d: "A most interesting proposal has just been wired to the officials at the Foreign Office by our consulate staff in Calcutta. In the midst of increasingly worrying development in the other Indian successor states to the imperialist Raj, our good friends and proletarian brothers in [From.GetNameDef] are proposing a final economic deal to strengthen the backbone of their otherwise wobbly government with technical and industrial advisers from our British Union. In exchange, the workingman of Britain will receive a steady supply of bananas, tea and other exotic goods while his benevolent government gains access to vital resources such as rubber. R.H. Tawney, a seasoned politician with solid socialist credentials and good connections with Congress cadres in India from the early days of our Union, awaits the acceptance of London before boarding a ship to Calcutta to flesh out the deal."
beng.40.a: "R.H. Tawney sails for Calcutta once more!"
beng.40.b: "No way! International trade is the harbinger of capitalism!"
beng.41.t: "[From.GetName] Has Refused"
beng.41.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government sends word declining the trade deal."
beng.41.a: "No tea for the English, then!"
beng.42.t: "Trading Tea for Arms"
beng.42.d: "R.H. Tawney, the man who had ensured cordial relations between Calcutta and London in the chaotic days during the collapse of the British Empire, has arrived once more in India! He brings the greetings of our dear proletarian friends in [From.GetNameDef] and promises of a new and empowered industrial cooperation between the working people of our nations. Tawney himself oversaw the first nascent dispatch of British railway engineers and with his own roots firmly planted in the soil of India he's determined to ensure that this new round of cooperation develop successfully. All that remains, is for our government to name its request in exchange of London's technical support."
beng.42.a: "Let us request industrial and engineering aid."
beng.42.b: "Let us request aid to establish a People's Air Force."
beng.42.c: "Let us ask for support in training a new People's Navy."
beng.43.t: "R.H. Tawney Reports Back"
beng.43.d.industry: "In Calcutta, our man at the negotiations, people's delegate R.H. Tawney has reported back that the Indian government wishes to conclude a treaty regarding the facilitation of British industrial aid and development in exchange for access to a greater amount of the vast wealth of India. Our colleagues in the Bengal are anxiously awaiting our response."
beng.43.d.airforce: "In Calcutta, our man at the negotiations, people's delegate R.H. Tawney has reported back that the Indian government wishes to conclude a treaty regarding the facilitation of British martial aid and development in exchange for access to a greater amount of the vast wealth of India. Our colleagues in the Bengal are anxiously awaiting our response."
beng.43.d.navy: "In Calcutta, our man at the negotiations, people's delegate R.H. Tawney has reported back that the Indian government wishes to conclude a treaty regarding the facilitation of British naval aid and development in exchange for access to a greater amount of the vast wealth of India. Our colleagues in the Bengal are anxiously awaiting our response."
beng.43.a: "Of course, solidarity forever!"
beng.43.b: "They really must be joking."
beng.44.t: "British Aid Arrives"
beng.44.d: "After a perilous month at sea, the development aid we asked from our friends in Britain has finally arrived at the docks of Calcutta. With such a huge boost to our state we might just be able to crush the reactionaries throughout the subcontinent - from the Khyber Pass to Cape Comorin."
beng.44.a: "Behold the power of proletarian cooperation!"
#beng.48.t: "Ho Chi Minh is Invited to Calcutta"
#beng.48.d: "Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Indochinese Syndicalist Party has been invited to Calcutta to form a government in exile aimed at fermenting revolution in our former colony, currently held by the Germans. This could be a easy way to destabilise the German colonial empire."
#beng.48.a: "Bon voyage, comrade Ho Chi Minh!"
#beng.48.b: "Can't risk the trip, frightfully sorry."
#beng.49.t: "[From.GetName] Has Refused"
#beng.49.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government sends word that the trip would be too dangerous for Ho Chi Minh, and they see no benefit to setting up the Indochinese shadow government in Calcutta."
#beng.49.a: "What? Outrageous!"
#beng.50.t: "[From.GetName] Has Agreed"
#beng.50.d: "We have received word from the [From.GetAdjective] government that Ho Chi Minh is on his way to Calcutta and should be here within the month."
#beng.50.a: "Excellent news!"
beng.52.t: "Socialists of the North"
beng.52.d: "We've received word from a number of socialist cells in the north that they are ready to move. The best place they can gather in any number is away from the cities, and a site in the mountains of Shimla has been selected. This would give the rebels a chance to open a second front with our enemies...but it comes with the chance the Dominion might discover our plans early and thus put us at a disadvantage. For good or ill, the moment the rebels begin to act, we will be at war."
beng.52.a: "Make the attempt, no matter the risk."
beng.52.b: "Abandon this scheming and declare war!"
beng.53.t: "Failed Uprising in Shimla"
beng.53.d: "We've received information of socialist rebels swarming to the remote province of Shimla, and managed to intercept them in time before they could gather in sufficient numbers to truly pose a threat. We've learned that the rebels were being directly organised by [BHC.GetNameDef], and - far worse than that - [BHC.GetNameDef] has plans to invade us, which the rebels were supposed to assist with. We must prepare ourselves for war."
beng.53.a: "Then the time has come."
beng.54.t: "Successful Uprising in Shimla"
beng.54.d: "The socialist rebels managed to gather in Shimla without being detected by the Dominion or her allies. It is time for the war to begin!"
beng.54.a: "Jai Hind!"
beng.55.t: "Socialist Uprising in Shimla!"
beng.55.d: "Even as [BHC.GetAdjective] troops cross our border, we have reports that a socialist uprising has begun in the remote mountains of Shimla - no doubt organised by [BHC.GetNameDef] itself, right under our noses, to give us a second front to fight. We will need to move quickly."
beng.55.a: "Damned socialist bastards!"
beng.56.t: "Socialists of the West"
beng.56.d: "We've received word from a number of socialist cells in the west that they are ready to move. The best place they can gather in any number is away from the major cities, and a remote site in the hills of Kolhapur has been selected. This would give the rebels a chance to open a second front with our enemies...but it comes with the chance [PRF.GetNameDef] might discover our plans early and thus put us at a disadvantage. For good or ill, the moment the rebels begin to act, we will be at war."
beng.56.a: "Make the attempt, no matter the risk."
beng.56.b: "Abandon this scheming and declare war!"
beng.57.t: "Failed Uprising in Kolhapur"

beng.59.a: "Damned socialist bastards!"
beng.60.t: "Chaos in [PRF.GetNameDef]!"
beng.60.d: "Osman Ali Khan's autocratic ambitions and hubris have finally driven the southern princes into open revolt! For the second time in a decade, the Hindu rulers of Mysore and Travancore waver in their oaths of loyalty towards their nominal overlord. Kannada and Malayalam troops already openly engage army units loyal to the Hyderabad government whilst the federal apparatus of state in the south has been thrown into absolute disarray. While it risks provoking the Nizam into war with us, and perhaps [DEH.GetNameDef], this could be an opportune time to seize nearby Vizagapatnam which lies just across our border. Chances are good the Nizam is too busy to respond and will simply let it go."
beng.60.a: "Send forces in to occupy Vizagapatnam"
beng.60.b: "No, this is too risky a plan"
beng.61.t: "Socialist Forces Move Into Vizagapatnam"
beng.61.d: "No doubt taking advantage of our chaotic state, soldiers from [BHC.GetNameDef] have begun streaming across the border into Vizagapatnam, fully intending to seize it and the entire state while we are busy with our civil war. If we attempt to stop them, it will mean open war with the east in addition to our current problems."
beng.61.a: "We have no choice but to let them have it."
beng.61.b: "We must fight for our territorial integrity!"
beng.62.t: "Vizagapatnam Is Ours"
beng.62.d: "As we suspected, the [PRF.GetAdjective] forces are too preoccupied to do much more than express outrage at our occupation of Vizagapatnam. By the time the war is done, the border will have been solidified."
beng.62.a: "A fait accompli!"
beng.70.t: "A Message of Peace"
beng.70.d: "Our government has received a message today, sent through channels by [BHC.GetNameDef] leadership. In it, the Mahatma requests a secret meeting between our nations - without our allies or others present, only true Indians - to discuss the possibility of a peaceful merger. One can only speculate what the Mahatma would ask, though most assume it would mean withdrawing from the Entente at the very least, and it's expected that such a plan would meet harsh resistance from the [BHC.GetAdjective] Totalist faction. But...what if it's true? What if the Mahatma can indeed quell his extremists, and we can discuss a union without ever firing a shot? The reactionaries of [PRF.GetNameDef] would never go for such a deal, but should we?"
beng.70.a: "We will attend the secret summit, if it's held."
beng.70.b: "We must speak with our allies, first."
beng.70.c: "No, even if this is serious, it will never work."
beng.71.t: "[From.GetName] Has Refused"
beng.71.d: "While we had high hopes that the [DEH.GetAdjective] would see reason and a benefit to peaceful talks, we've received quick word through channels that they will not attend any meeting to discuss reunion."
beng.71.a: "Then our path is set, sadly."
beng.72.t: "A Request from Delhi"
beng.72.d: "Curious news from Delhi today - officials from [DEH.GetNameDef] tell us that [BHC.GetNameDef] has reached out to their government to begin talks about peaceful reunion. It's unknown what the Mahatma would ask for, of it Delhi would even agree, but most believe it would mean withdrawal from the Entente at the very least. It would, however, never happen without the [BHC.GetAdjective] extremists first being quelled...so the result would be an India that was not our ally, but also not our enemy. If we refuse to give them permission, it's unknown how Delhi would react...or what we could really do if they refused to comply."
beng.72.a: "We give this meeting our blessing."
beng.72.b: "No, they are too important to the Empire's interests."
beng.73.t: "[From.GetName] Urges Caution"
beng.73.d: "Our response from the [From.GetAdjective] government is caution: [Root.GetNameDef] is too vital to the Empire's interests to allow us to fall prey to what is surely a socialist scheme. A disappointing response, even if they might be correct. Even so, if we attended the meeting anyhow, what would they do about it? Go to war with us? There's no guarantee the meeting would even happen, or that we would agree to its results."
beng.73.a: "We will attend the talks anyhow."
beng.73.b: "So be it - give the Mahatma our regrets."
beng.74.t: "[From.GetName] Gives its Blessing"
beng.74.d: "The response from the [From.GetAdjective] government is cautious approval. If we can truly reunite with our fellow Indians, and in so doing eliminate the syndicalist threat to the sub-continent, then they would be willing to cut ties with the Dominion if that is what it takes. There is, after all, very little they could realistically do if we left, but they appreciate our consultation."
beng.74.a: "Then tell the Mahatma we would be willing to attend."
beng.74.b: "No, on second thought there's no use in risking this."
beng.75.t: "Delhi Agrees to the Summit"
beng.75.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to the talks, though it's clear they are quite sceptical that we will propose something they can accept - or that we will not face serious opposition from extremists in our own camp. That last concern is true enough. Word of the summit will undoubtedly leak out before it happens, and we will have a reckoning with Subhas Chandra Bose and the Maximists, if not also others who support him."
beng.75.a: "So be it!"
beng.76.t: "The Lucknow Summit"
beng.76.d: "Representatives from both [DEH.GetNameDef] and [BHC.GetNameDef] have gathered today in the city of Lucknow for a secret summit - one not attended by [DEH.GetNameDef]'s allies, and mostly unknown to the peoples of either country. The Mahatma is personally in attendance, and hopes to convince both sides of a plan of compromise which can allow them to come together and avoid a second costly civil war which will end needless lives. The reaction, should a plan of reunion emerge, will be difficult to anticipate."
beng.76.a: "We shall see how this goes..."
beng.77.t: "The Final Plan"
beng.77.d: "After days of quiet deliberation, Gandhi and the attendees from [DEH.GetNameDef] have reached an accord. It lays out various measures which would allow collective industry to remain in the Bengal region, and for limits to be placed on princely power and affluence. It also means severing ties with the British Empire completely, and allowing the socialists to be permitted in future Indian elections - but not as syndicalists. Many Commune politicians and officers would be shut out of the system entirely, and there would be great adjustments to be made on both sides."
beng.77.a: "Yes, we would agree to this - make the offer."
beng.77.b: "No, this is too much - call off the summit now."
beng.78.t: "The Final Plan"
beng.78.d: "After days of quiet deliberation, Gandhi and the attendees from [DEH.GetNameDef] have reached an accord. It lays out various measures which would allow collective industry to remain in the Bengal region, and for limits to be placed on princely power and affluence. It also means severing ties with the British Empire completely, and allowing the socialists to be permitted in future Indian elections - though not as syndicalists. Gandhi would become the temporary head of state until elections are held to approve the plan, though by then the merger will be a fait accompli...if we agree to the plan."
beng.78.a: "For good or ill, we agree to the Mahatma's proposal."
beng.78.b: "No, this is too much - let's end this here."
beng.79.t: "The Summit is Over"
beng.79.d: "After days of quiet deliberation, it's become more and more clear that neither party will reach an agreement on reunification. The delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has elected to abandon the summit rather than continue talking, and so goes the last hope of peace on the sub-continent."
beng.79.a: "So be it."
beng.80.t: "Success at the Summit"
beng.80.d: "The talks at the Lucknow Summit are over and a deal has been struck: the Commune will become part of the Dominion, with Gandhi assuming a role as head of state until elections are held in thirty days to approve the plan. Socialists will be permitted, but not syndicalists, and already many of our politicians and commanders are reacting with fury at being left out of the new government. What's done is done, however, and now will come a period of severe adjustment for both sides to come to terms with the new reality."
beng.80.a: "Jai Hind!"
beng.81.t: "The Bharatiya Exiles"
beng.81.d: "Over the last days, streams of exiles from the former Dominion and the Commune have streamed into [Root.GetNameDef], seeking refuge and offering to fight for a true India - one represented not by traitors and socialists. We've ensured no syndicalist sympathisers number among their ranks, and there is also word that some of the north's princes do not take kindly to the Unionist Party's scheming and may attempt to break away and join our ranks. We shall see what [DEH.GetNameDef]'s coming election brings."
beng.81.a: "One way or another, a reckoning is coming."
beng.82.t: "Maximists Threaten War"
beng.82.d: "Word of the upcoming Lucknow Summit has spread, and Subhas Chandra Bose is up in arms over it. The leader of the Maximists has been spreading misinformation, suggesting that Totalist and syndicalist leaders would be imprisoned should the union occur, and now he's drummed up enough support to make an ultimatum to the Agrarians: call off the Lucknow Summit immediately and have the Mahatma step down, or they will remove the Agrarians by force."
beng.82.a: "We cannot allow him to dictate the future of India."
beng.82.b: "Very well, we will call off the talks."
beng.83.t: "Maximists Seize Calcutta!"
beng.83.d: "Maximist forces have stormed into the capital, seizing the Indian National Congress buildings and rounding up the leaders of the Agrarians. The Mahatma has been spirited off to an unknown prison and the Agrarians themselves have had their power severely curtailed - indeed, they may not even be able to participate in future Congress events. The civil war is now over."
beng.83.a: "This will hurt."
beng.84.t: "War with [BHC.GetNameDef]"
beng.84.d: "The preparations are over. The time has come for us to march against [BHC.GetNameDef]!"
beng.84.a: "Se be it!"
beng.86.t: "The Maximists Are Defeated"
beng.86.d: "Subhas Chandra Bose and his Maximists have been defeated, and already many of their leadership have been rounded up and imprisoned. The Maximists themselves will no longer be welcome at Congress, though the Agrarians are loathe to actually outlaw them entirely or execute any of their members. Surely they would have done the same in reverse, had they the chance."
beng.86.a: "But we're not them, are we?"
beng.87.t: "We Are Victorious!"
beng.87.d: "We have gained control over the entirety of the Bharatiya Commune - its future is now ours to dictate!"
beng.87.a: "As it should be!"
beng.88.t: "[From.GetName] In Chaos"
beng.88.d: "While we avoided stepping into the conflict during its civil war, as both sides would quickly end their conflict the moment we crossed the border, the dust has settled in [From.GetNameDef] and it is now weak...perhaps weak enough to be easily defeated."
beng.88.a: "They picked a poor time for a civil war."
beng.89.t: "Agrarians Threaten War"
beng.89.d.purge: "The purges to the Commune's army - more important, the efforts made by the Maximists to eliminate all officers loyal to the other factions - has stirred a great deal of anger within the Indian National Congress. The opposition has centred on the Mahatma himself, who has called on Bose to step down as chairman. While Gandhi has advocated peaceful resistance, there are elements within the Agrarians who are ready to lead a general uprising in his name - even if it means replacing him as party leader."
beng.89.d.war: "The recent efforts of the Maximists to ready the people for war, and - perhaps more importantly - the efforts to ensure their loyalty is solely to the Totalist portion of the Indian National Congress has elicited a great deal of alarm from the other parties. The opposition has centred on the Mahatma himself, who has called on Bose to step down as chairman. While Gandhi has advocated peaceful resistance, there are elements within the Agrarians who are ready to lead a general uprising in his name - even if it means replacing him as party leader."
beng.89.a: "The time has come to eliminate the Agrarians altogether."
beng.89.b: "Quietly eliminate Gandhi and the unrest will ease."
beng.90.t: "Agrarians Seize Calcutta!"
beng.90.d: "Agrarian forces have stormed into the capital, seizing the Indian National Congress buildings and rounding up the leaders of the Maximists. Subhas Chandra Bose has been arrested, and the Maximists themselves have had their power severely curtailed - indeed, they may not even be able to participate in future Congress events. The civil war is now over."
beng.90.a: "This will hurt."
beng.92.t: "Agrarians Seize Calcutta"
beng.93.t: "The Agrarians Are Defeated"
beng.93.d: "Nirmal Kumar Bose and his Agrarians have been defeated, and already many of their leadership have been rounded up and imprisoned. The Agrarians as a whole will no longer be welcome at Congress, their faction having been outlawed, and many of their most important members will be summarily executed after a speedy trial. Surely they would have done the same in reverse, had they the chance."
beng.93.a: "They will never get that chance again."
beng.100.t: "The State-Reorganisation Act"
beng.100.d: "The provinces of the vanquished reactionary states were organised in a predictably feudal manner. Princes administered some, while others fell under bourgeoisie control. Before venturing into debating what concrete political changes should be made to the societal structure of our new domains, Congress must first decide how to administer the new districts. Bose's Maximists argue for large blocs of coherent ethno-linguistic provinces together forming the backbone of the centralised state, whilst the Agrarians take the opposite stance and recommend smaller sub-state entities controlled by local village communes. Nehru's industrialists favour middle-sized linguistic states modelled on traditional provincial divisions, while Dange's Anarcho-Syndicalists suggest a union of council-driven provinces created by popular referendums. As the delegates take the floor, the first debate on the future of India is about to unfold!"

beng.101.t: "The Issue of Landlordism"
beng.101.d: "Prevalent throughout non-Socialist India, but especially in the Princely Federation, the zamindari system was a feudal institution of exploitation where landlords held economic and social power over the workers and farmers working on their factories and estates. With our liberation of the suffering proletariat, Congress now has to decide what to do with the means of production. The Maximists argue for swift centralisation, the Agrarians, as always, favour local village authority, the Moderates demand a balance of central and local ownership, while Dange's wing suggests orthodox Syndicalist theories of trade-union control as the solution to the administration of the liberated economic institutions."

beng.101.b: "Let the local villages assume control of the farms."
beng.101.c: "Let the provinces organise collectivisation individually."
beng.101.e: "Organise trade unions to run the collectivised farms."
beng.102.t: "Enforcing Economic Coherence"
beng.102.d: "The Indian sub-continent is as diverse economically as it is ethnically and religiously. The merchants in Bombay and Karachi thrive on foreign trade through the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez, while the peasants of the Gangetic Plain toil mainly for themselves and their local communities. It is thus extremely complex to tailor an economic policy able to cover all the various business and enterprise strata. However, that is just what Subhas Chandra Bose is proposing. Envisaging a total state involvement in all layers of business, the Maximists claim that only such drastic measures can ensure the total eradication of the capitalist society and the substantiation of a true egalitarian and socialist India. Naturally, the other wings of Congress beg to differ..."

beng.102.c: "Central planning and nationalisation of vital industries."
beng.102.e: "Orthodox Syndicalism shall unite all Indians economically."
beng.103.t: "Maintaining Order in the New Provinces"
beng.103.d: "As the army finished off its last opponents, the military consequently took on the role as a force of occupation. This is in some cases discouraging for our newly liberated brothers, as the presence of army patrols make us look not as liberators of the proletariat, but rather as foreign invaders. Some voices in Congress call for a more lenient strategy towards the new provinces, while others argue that a reduction of army units will inevitably pave the way for reactionary terrorists and guerrillas."
beng.103.a: "Martial law must be strictly enforced!"
beng.103.b: "The People's Police shall oversee integration."
beng.103.c: "Withdraw the army, but maintain garrisons in key cities."
beng.103.e: "Raise local workers' militias to enforce order."
beng.104.t: "Status of Minority, Religious, and Caste Rights"
beng.104.d: "A veritable mass of patterns of different ethnicities, religious, and caste sub groupings, Indian politics have always swayed between the extremes of cultural accommodation and subjection. The Calcutta government has employed a wide variety of policies within our own territories to maintain the rights of the so-called untouchables, people ostracised from society on religious grounds found in mainstream Hinduism. All parties agree that minority rights are essential, however the means of enforcing these in the far more traditional and conservative provinces recently liberated from reactionary rule seem to be far more difficult to agree upon. As the Congress draws to a close, it is evident that this last issue will be invaluable for any of the fractions who wish to secure a majority."
beng.104.a: "The army shall guard the rights of all the peoples of India!"
beng.104.b: "Untouchability is a sin. Let the people know it!"
beng.104.c: "A slow implementation of equal rights will secure stability."
beng.104.e: "Create workers' committees to ensure equality."
beng.105.t: "Bose's Maximists Control Congress"
beng.105.d: "As the special session of the INC concludes, a clear majority has gathered around the arguments of the martial giant Subhas Chandra Bose and his Maximists. With a clear mandate, it now falls on Bose to implement a new order on the Indian subcontinent and facilitate the birth of a Totalist Raj."
beng.105.a: "A Totalist Raj arises!"
beng.106.t: "Fazlul Huq and Nehru Sway Congress"
beng.106.d: "Despite rising tensions between Huq and Nehru, their coalition of radicalised Fabians and Bengali socialists have managed to form a party line supported by a majority of congress. As the pair prepare to ascend to government supremacy, the rest of congress pray that the partnership last long enough for India to regain her strength and flourish under enlightened socialism!"
beng.106.a: "India storms towards modernity and socialism!"
beng.107.t: "The Agrarians Control Congress"
beng.107.d.gandhi: "To the roaring applause of the Congress, the Mahatma, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi has received absolute support for his line by the party. It is hoped that Mr. Gandhi's conciliatory gestures will hasten the process of reuniting Mother India."

beng.107.a: "Our great nation shall be healed by the mercy of the victors."
beng.108.t: "Dange's Syndicalists Control Congress"
beng.108.d: "With his solid base of support in the Indian trade unions and a clever political alliance with the old revolutionary guard, Shripad Amrit Dange has managed to rally congress behind his anarcho-syndicalist platform. Now it is time to restore Mother India to her rightful place of glory by the means of true socialist liberation!"
beng.108.a: "Now we're truly an anarcho-syndicalist commune!"
beng.109.t: "The Congress Ends in a Stalemate"
beng.109.d: "Despite the debates going into the early hours, Congress has not yet found a single majority. It would appear that only some sort of coalition between the various fractions can lead to a working government. In this regard, Nehru might be the king-maker – as he stands comfortably between the extremes of the INC."
beng.109.a: "Bose and Nehru form a coalition!"
beng.109.b: "The Agrarians and Nehru combine to form a majority!"
beng.109.c: "Nehru utilises Dange's union support to take the presidency!"
beng.110.t: "The Place of the Red Raj in the World"
beng.110.d: "With India united behind the Calcutta government and the provinces of the pretender governments brought under Socialist administration, the cabinet has begun to debate what course we should take internationally. A logical decision would be to seek an alignment with the International and thus formally take our rightful place among the great Syndicalist nations of the world. Others, however, argue that we ought to make our own bloc of alliances – a force of Socialism with an oriental face. Such a course would definitely allow us greater freedom when it comes to spreading the revolution, but might cost us the technological benefit of associating with the great armies of the International."
beng.110.a: "We shall be the Internationale's Sword in Asia!"
beng.110.b: "On our own, Asia shall be painted RED!"
beng.110.c: "Let us rebuild India in splendid isolation."
beng.111.t: "India Wants to Join the Internationale"
beng.111.d: "The fragmented remains of the British Raj have finally been reunited under the aegis of the leftist Calcutta government. As if this wasn't good enough news for the worldwide proletariat, the new Indian government has requested to be aligned as a member of the Internationale!"
beng.111.a: "Workers of the World, Unite!"
beng.111.b: "We have no use for Bolsheviks in turbans..."
beng.112.t: "[From.GetName] Has Refused"
beng.112.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has sent word that the International has no need of our alliance."
beng.112.a: "Is that so?"
beng.113.t: "The Case of the Delhi Government's Officer Corps"
beng.113.d: "The National Government has finally dislodged the last vestiges of British influence on the Indian sub-continent and enforced a truly native system of governance on the troublesome north-western provinces. Some of the officers who once swore loyalty to the Delhi Government have expressed wishes to continue to serve Mother India, placing the nation above political alignment. However, if we enrol these men we might face trouble from our own officers who resent serving alongside former enemies."
beng.113.a: "The Nation needs every single man!"
beng.113.b: "We have no need for British lapdogs!"
beng.114.t: "Integration in the Gangetic Plain"
beng.114.d: "The Gangetic plain is the main economic artery for Indian commerce and industry. The sooner the better these people come under the complete control of Calcutta, the better."
beng.114.a: "Our policies have united the people in Socialist brotherhood."
beng.114.b: "Take a moderate approach to integration."
beng.114.c: "We must be forceful in establishing socialist control!"
beng.115.t: "Integration in the North-West"
beng.115.d: "The North-western provinces of India have been a stronghold of petty bourgeoisie interests mixed with several reactionary princely states. The traders and industrialists of Karachi and the Punjab particularly seem to oppose any radical change to the economic and societal changes we propose. We must tread carefully in order to secure their loyalty...or be forceful."
beng.115.a: "Take a moderate approach to integration."
beng.115.b: "We must be forceful in establishing socialist control!"
beng.116.t: "Control Asserted in [new_core.GetName]"
beng.116.d: "While it has been difficult to wean the locals away from their over-dependence on British handouts and democratic coddling, the state of [new_core.GetName] has been assimilated can finally be called a true part of [Root.GetNameDef]!"
beng.116.a: "It's about time!"
beng.117.t: "Resistance in [damage_state.GetName]!"
beng.117.d: "Protests in the formerly British-puppet state of [damage_state.GetName] have grown increasingly violent as of late, spurred on by what we believe to be a democratic resistance group operating out of remote regions in the territory. Multiple terrorist bombings have accompanied the protests, and will likely continue until we fully assert control over [damage_state.GetName]'s people."
beng.117.a: "This is what they call 'freedom'?!"
beng.118.t: "What to do with the Reactionary Officers"
beng.118.d: "We have through the force of arms and diplomacy eradicated the two reactionary pretender governments and proclaimed a new progressive Raj of socialist equality. Some of the non-royal commissioned officers of our defeated enemies have expressed a desire to serve in our armed forces, putting the nation above political concern. Tempting it is, including former enemies in the Red Army could be a dangerous thing..."
beng.118.a: "We will employ all who will fight for the revolution!"
beng.118.b: "We cannot trust these reactionary maggots!"
beng.119.t: "Integration in the Former Bombay Presidency"
beng.119.d: "In the former Bombay Presidency there's a strong labour movement in Bombay city itself. This will be valuable when commencing our process of integration, although the interior villages and cities have a more conservative streak. Never the less, we must decide upon a course of action when it comes to the process of integration."
beng.119.a: "Take a moderate approach to integration."
beng.119.b: "We must be forceful in establishing socialist control!"
beng.120.t: "Integration in the Dravidian Princely States"
beng.120.d: "The southern princely states were always somewhat politically detached from the federal government in Hyderabad. This makes it harder for us to establish an efficient central administration. Never the less, that is what we will have to achieve."
beng.120.a: "Take a moderate approach to integration."
beng.120.b: "We must be forceful in establishing socialist control!"

beng.122.t: "Resistance in [damage_state.GetName]!"

beng.122.a: "No doubt funded with princely wealth..."
beng.125.t: "A Special Session of the INC"
beng.125.d: "The constitutionally mandated 5-year term of the incumbent executive committee has come to an end, marking the beginning of a new round of political skulduggery and backstabbing as the various factions vie for control over congress. Calcutta is draped in the red flag of Free India and the streets are alive with the sounds of excitement."
beng.125.a: "Let's get to work, comrades!"
beng.126.t: "The Judicial Reform Act"
beng.126.d: "In the wake of Indian reunification under the aegis of the Calcutta government, a major source of discontent across the subcontinent has proven to be the lack of central direction of the judicial system. With some provinces and districts being in the hands of local worker's and peasant's committees and others still ruling based on the old colonial codes, the Congress is in agreement that a more effective and streamlined legal apparatus is sorely needed. However, how such a system precisely should function - and who should control it - is hotly debated by all."
beng.126.a: "All within the state, nothing against the state."
beng.126.b: "A decentralised three-tier system for each province."
beng.126.c: "A strong supreme court is needed to secure our liberty."
beng.126.e: "A league of union tribunals should do the trick."
beng.127.t: "The States and the Central Government"
beng.127.d: "Five years have passed since the States Reorganisation Act was adopted by Congress, yet friction still exists between the provinces and the central government as to who should wield the most influence in the villages and cities of India. The Maximists wish the states to be completely subjugated to the rulings of the executive, only retaining insignificant administrative power. The Agrarian Wing, on the contrary, argues the complex nature of the Indian nation calls for a loose confederation of states with the executive only permitted supreme control of defence matters and All-Indian industries. Dange's Anarcho-Syndicalists share the mistrust of a strong central government, but suggest creating a coordinating States Committee elected by local trade unions to ensure some coherence amongst India's provinces. Nehru proposes a quasi-federal structure with each province retaining a token legislative as well as chief ministers and governors, who in turn answer to the central government."

beng.127.d.noagr: "Five years have passed since the States Reorganisation Act was adopted by Congress, yet friction still exists between the provinces and the central government as to who should wield the most influence in the villages and cities of India. The Maximists wish the states to be completely subjugated to the rulings of the executive, only retaining insignificant administrative power.

beng.127.e: "A decentralised structure under a States Committee."
beng.128.t: "The Industrial Policy Resolution Act"
beng.128.d: "Industrial development has been a major focus for most of the congress factions (as even the Agrarians recognise the need for some heavy industry), but the question of which course is the right for our nation's industrial sector is as hotly contended as ever."
beng.128.a: "All layers of the economy must be centrally administered."
beng.128.b: "India must become completely self-sufficient."
beng.128.c: "Central planning and nationalisation of vital industries."
beng.128.e: "Orthodox Syndicalism shall unite all Indians economically."
beng.129.t: "The Case of Our Foreign Obligations"
beng.129.d: "The Revolution might have triumphed in India and heralded in a new era of Socialist brotherhood under the aegis of the Red Raj, but the world is still plagued by the twin evils of the possessing classes - feudalism and capitalism. Although we already have a significant diplomatic presence abroad, the issue of our commitment to the international welfare of the Syndicalist system has come up as an important point in today's debates. As usual, the most glaring difference is between the Agrarians and the Maximists, with the former advocating a peaceful promotion of Socialism within India, while the latter argue bellicosely for the revolution to be promoted abroad at bayonet point. Dange and Nehru occupy a middle position."

beng.130.t: "The Case of Military Restructuring"
beng.130.d: "Although the Indian Red Army was successful in its charge to secure the reunification of the subcontinent under the control of the Calcutta Government, it has become a too-rigid organisation with conflicting loyalties. Always distrusting of too-centrally controlled authority, both Dange's Syndicalists and the Agrarians argue for a gradual demobilisation and a thorough democratisation of the armed forces, Dange even going so far as to call for democratically-elected officers chosen by the serviceman's trade unions. Both Nehru and the Totalists believe in a strong army, but the former places far more emphasis on reforming and upgrading the existing equipment, while the Totalists wish to expand all three service branches while also enforcing a strict hierarchical command structure with full military discipline."

Now it is time to restore Mother India to her rightful place of glory by the means of true socialist liberation!"
beng.134.a: "Now we're truly an anarcho-syndicalist commune!"
beng.135.t: "The Congress Ends in a Stalemate"
beng.135.d: "Despite the debates going into the early hours, Congress has not yet found a single majority. It would appear that only some sort of coalition between the various fractions can lead to a working government. In this regard, Nehru might be the king-maker – as he stands comfortably between the extremes of the INC."
beng.135.a: "Nehru forms a coalition with the Maximists!"
beng.135.b: "Nehru convinces the Agrarians to support his platform!"
beng.135.c: "Nehru utilises Dange's union support to take the presidency!"

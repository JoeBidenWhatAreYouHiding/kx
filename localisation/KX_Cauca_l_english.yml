cau.1.t: "Our Time Has Come"
cau.1.d: "Amidst the [COC.GetAdjective] conflict in the east, Bogota and its government find themselves at their most vulnerable.\nThis presents a strategic opportunity for us to strike them.\n\nThe socialists, offering a more promising alternative than Rojas Pinilla and his reactionary junta, have garnered support. Many advocate aligning with the rebels, at least temporarily. This initial collaboration could pave the way for dealing with the socialists once our common oppressors are defeated — whether through taking up arms or diplomatic means. Currently, the socialists pose no immediate threat, and are actively pursuing a shared front against Rojas Pinilla.\n\nThen again, we could pursue peace by negotiating a non-aggression agreement with Bogota, albeit risking displeasure from the [COC.GetAdjective]. On the positive side, such an agreement would afford us more time to prepare.\nThe tribes await a response from their leader as we navigate these critical decisions."
cau.1.a: "War is inevitable, let's attack first."
cau.1.b: "We will pursue a non agression agreement."
cau.1.c: "Strike both [COL.GetName] and [COC.GerName]"

cau.2.t: "No Response From Bogota"
cau.2.d_2: "Much to our dismay, Bogota has remained silent in response to our proposition, seemingly disregarding our non-aggression proposal within the opulent confines of the presidential palace.\nWith Rojas Pinilla and his corrupted associates unwilling to even consider our offer, we find ourselves left with no alternative but to resort to an unavoidable solution: launching an attack.\n\nThe finite hours of the white oppressor are dwindling, and midnight approaches swiftly. We have resolved to strike at the first light of dawn."
cau.2.a: "For our brothers and sisters."

cau.3.t: "No Response From Bogota"
cau.3.d: "Surprisingly, Bogota has shown no response to our troops positioned along our shared border.\nDespite our readiness, Rojas Pinilla and his corrupt associates seem unwilling to take any action or organize against us. Faced with their inertia, we are compelled to embrace an inevitable course of action: to strike preemptively before they have the chance to do so to us.\n\nThe finite hours of the white oppressor are dwindling, and midnight approaches swiftly. We have resolved to strike at the first light of dawn."
cau.3.a: "For our brothers and sisters."

cau.4.t: "Bogota Preentively Strikes"
cau.4.d: "As expected, Bogota has displayed no remorse and preemptively declared war against us. We are now compelled to engage in a battle that will undoubtedly stain our sacred soil with blood.\nHowever, upon achieving victory, the world will recognize that this war was fought for the cause of freedom and in defense of our fundamental rights.\n\nThe finite hours of the white oppressor are dwindling, and midnight approaches swiftly. We have resolved to strike at the first light of dawn."
cau.4.a: "For our brothers and sisters."

cau.5.t: "Bogota Accepts Our Proposal"
cau.5.d: "In a surprising turn of events, Bogota has agreed to our temporary non-aggression proposal.\nHowever, we must refrain from excessive celebration, as it is widely understood that once Rojas Pinilla deals with the socialists, we become the next targets. Unless, of course, the socialists emerge victorious — an outcome that seems plausible given their unwavering determination and intimate knowledge of the battleground.\n\nRegardless of the ultimate outcome, the opportunity to organize and train additional soldiers during this period will prove beneficial when the time for war inevitably arrives."
cau.5.a: "Let's root for the [COC.GetName] then."

cau.300.t: "Our Second Language"
cau.300.d: "Controlling language is one of the keys to unlocking complete power. Recognising this, we have issued an important decree in regards to the official language of our new state, which has become a delicate topic to say the least.\n\nAll other tribes and their native tongue were considered, except for the Tayronas who are still adamant in continuing their isolation. The most promising are the Wayuu, who speak Wayuunaiki and are located in the North-East region of La Guajira, since they are by far the largest group on the list. Furthermore, they are renowned for being one of the very last tribes to be conquered, only being defeted just after Venezuela had seperated from Gran Colombia. Secondly are the Senú, also called Zenú, located halfway between Medellin and Cartagena, whose native tongue was lost to them many years ago by fault of the Conquistadors - the main reason, as we suspect, to their advocacy of keeping Spanish as a second language. Lastly, there are the Muisca who originate near Bogota and speak Chibcha. Despite being a rather small group, someone had pointed out that they were nonetheless the most important and most well-known natives in the eyes of foreign nations worldwide - to choose them would probably legitimise our state greatly internationally and internally. The question is clear; which tongue should we pick as our official second language?"
cau.300.a: "We stand stronger together - Wayuunaiki."
cau.300.b: "It wouldn't be difficult to stick with Spanish."
cau.300.c: "Chibcha. The Muiscas will legitimise our cause."

cau.989.t: "The Renaiming Proposal"
cau.989.d: "Now that the war is over and that we came out victorious in our struggle against the white man that oppressed us for hundreds and hundreds of years, the council is requesting to take action in establishing our sovregnity over our ancestral lands. With such a diverse council, formed by different tribes of different cultures the opinion on what to do came up very varied.\nOn one thing however pretty much everyone aggrees: the various deparments of what once was known as Colombia, along with the name of most cities, bear a name that represent the white man, and not the people that lives here since the beginning of time. It's the case of the Santander department, named as such after a white general that liberated the white men from other white men -but keeped the 'indios' subjugated, or the Narino department that shares a name with the man who brought from France and translated to spanish the Declaration of Human Right, but that never thought of translating the same document to any indigenous language. And one can't even count the amount of cities that are called 'Saint...whatever'.\nThe council deliberated that our sons and the future generation should not live in cities named after european mitological figures or catholic saints, but they should, instead, learn to call Bogotá and Medellin as Bacatá and Aburrá, according to their historical pre-hispanic names.\nShould we proceed with this operation?"
cau.989.a: "That's the logical fist step, proceed."
cau.989.b: "That would be too much."

### LEADERS ###
POLITICS_CAU_QUINTIN_LAME_DESC: "Manuel Quintín Lame is of Nasa ethnicity on both sides of his family, a fact he likes to remind everyone who questions him about his intentions and dedication to our cause. The popular indigenous leader was just 5 years old when tragedy first struck his family, for during the early years of the civil war that brought an end to the federalized system in Colombia, his family was subjected to harassment at the hands of some irregular militiamen, with even his mute older sister Licenia not being spared from their brutality.\nSomething changed inside Manuel Quintín after these years of abuse, and in the years that followed he started to pursue his new dream of establishing an independent and ethnically pure nation for the Colombian indigenous peoples to live in peace, far from the barbarities wrought by the 'White Man'. Fully immersed in this project he started to travel around the country and abroad while continuing to pursue his studies of radical literature throughout his teen years, eventually finding an occasion to act when another civil war broke in the country in 1899. He and his brothers enrolled in the Conservative Party's militia, but tragically only he came back alive.\nThe civil war left the country broken in spirit and without Panama, so Quintín attempted to seize on the opportunity presented to him amidst the chaos, finally put his plan into practice. In 1914, the natives under his command rebelled in Cauca, and yet, his plan once again failed. The indigenous leader would not give up however, trying again and again to wage war against the White Man, but he came up short each time, landing himself in jail on multiple occasions. In 1931, while he was once again imprisoned, the 'White Man' took revenge on Manuel Quintín Lame by carrying out a hit on his supporters hiding out throughout the hinterlands, killing 17 and injuring 37 of them in a secret operation.\n\nAfter so many losses, destiny finally turned in favor of Lame. Quintín managed to successfully seize on this final opportunity for himself and now he leads most of the native people of Colombia on a sovereign and proud path hellbent on finally taking their future into their own hands."

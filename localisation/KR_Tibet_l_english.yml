### Leaders ###
POLITICS_NICHOLAS_ROERICH_DESC:0 "Raised by the aristocratic Roerich family of St. Petersburg, Nicholas has expressed interest in both the aesthetic and spiritual side of socialist revolution. This interest led Nicholas first into the Arts, where he graduated from St. Petersburg University and the Imperial Academy of the Arts in 1897. Nicholas became immersed in Russian avant garde art, which included working with the legendary Igor Stravinsky and Vaslav Nijinsky. The October Revolution ended the social peace that Nicholas had known, and set Nicholas closer to social conservatism and orientalism in opposition to Vladimir Lenin.\nNicholas Roerich fled to the United States and joined the Theosophical Society, a spiritual movement that shared Roerich's admiration of undeveloped nations as 'more spiritually pure' than westernized counterparts. Roerich visited the Theosophical Society in both the Bharatiya Commune and British Dominion in 1930, and had a startling conversation with Gandhi. Gandhi expressed to Roerich that Vladimir Lenin was not against traditional culture, but against corrupt leaders of traditional institutions.\nNicholas Roerich decided to take his family to visit Tibet through the Shimla mountains, and received a second calling in the mountains. A sherpa guiding Roerich remarked 'Is it true, that Lenin was not against Buddhism?' This led to a religious experience in Nicholas, which ended the expedition when he spoke of this in Lhasa. Nicholas began describing Vladimir Lenin as 'Mahatma Lenin' and was forced to leave Tibet by the Ganden Phodrang for this heretical idea. Back in Bharatiya, Nicholas was alerted to a possible revolution in Tibet emanating from Sikkim. In Sikkim, Nicholas Roerich combined his revelations with an endorsement from Gandhi to form the Sacred Union Party, a revolutionary party dedicated to saving Tibetan Buddhism through Esoteric Leninism."
POLITICS_9TH_PACHEN_LAMA_DESC:0 "The 9th Panchen Lama was born Choekyi Nyima into the Thuben class in Shigatse, Tibet. Raised and educated by the prestigious Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, the young Choekyi Nyima was predestined to be the 'Great Scholar' under the Dalai Lama, and was for a time well respected by the Ganden Phodrang. As a young scholar, the 9th Panchen Lama met with radical lama Agvan Dorzhiev, who taught him the Prayer to Shambhala. This prayer was intended to collect the allies of Buddhism together to the center of the world, the fictional city of Shambhala. Political realities came in 1924 when the 13th Dalai Lama was modernizing his army. The Dalai Lama demanded more taxation from the Panchen Lama as part of his feudal duties. When the Panchen Lama refused, The Dalai Lama cut off the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and confiscated the Panchen Lama's property. The resulting conflict forced the Panchen Lama to flee Tibet to Mongolia in 1924.\nThe Panchen Lama, seeing Mongolia as unable to aid in his return under Baron Ungern, left for Bharatiya in 1931. In Bharatiya, the Panchen Lama connected with the other exiled Tibetan nobles Pandatsang Rapga and Thubten Kunphela. These two exiles had connection in Kham, and had aligned themselves with exiled KMT generals to form the Tibet Improvement Party. The Panchen Lama, seeing no other way to return to Tibet save for an invasion, joined the Tibet Improvement Party and began publishing commentaries of Sun Yat Sen's Three Principles of the People. The storm of the revolution saw the Panchen Lama promise to preserve the existence of the Ganden Phodrang while removing their ability to choose the Kashag."
POLITICS_TSIPON_LUNGSHAR_DESC:0 "Tsipön Lungshar comes from a family that has served the Dalai Lama since the 18th century, and has deep connections to Lhasa. Lungshar was chosen to supervise the elite education of four nobles called the 'Rugby Four' in the UK prior to the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Lungshar stood in between the more radical nobles like Thuben Kunphela and Trimön in the early years of the Regency. It was Lungshar who accused Thuben Kunphela of orchestrating a foreign infiltration of Tibet in 1933, leading to his exile. However, Lungshar also opposed the power of the Regency, especially their strongman Trimön. Trimön orchestrated a trial where Lungshar was accused of being a socialist, then blinded before being exiled to Sikkim. The revolution saved Lungshar's life, and enabled him to return to Tibet and found the Kyicho Kuntun, a moderate political party that wishes to balance the needs of democracy with the traditions of Tibet."
POLITICS_TSARONG_DZASA_DESC:0 "When the 13th Dalai Lama decided to modernize the army in 1923, he put nobleman Tsarong Dzasa in charge of the newly created Dmag-Sgar. Tsarong previously had a very successful career leading the Dob Dobs in defending Tibet from the Qing during the Xinhai revolution. Defeating the Qing earned Tsarong the name 'Hero of Chaksam', and he used his popularity to increase the national budget for Tibet's army. This indirectly caused the expulsion of the Panchen Lama in 1924. The death of the 13th Dalai Lama left the country in the control of the Regency, led by the 5th Reting Rinpoche and Trimön. Tsarong was demoted from Commander-In-Chief to Civil Engineer and Treasurer, but this failed to stop his popularity. Trimön was initially happy when Tsarong left for Utsang, along with his Young Tibet movement, but now Trimön sits in the Potala prison while Tsarong has effectively assumed his position. The 5th Reting Rinpoche now only serves as Regent unable to leave the Ganden Phodrang until the 14th Dalai Lama is revealed."
POLITICS_JAMPHEL_YESHE_GYALTSEN_DESC:0 "Thubten Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen, nobleman, friend to the 13th Dalai Lama, and Regent of Tibet. The 5th Reting Rinpoche presided over a tumultuous period in Tibetan history, one that saw numerous exiles, tortures, and heavy reliance on the Commander-In-Chief Trimön to stay in power. The Reting Rinpoche stood behind Trimön's continuation of the tax increases, and stands as the most legitimate leader of Tibet until the 14th Dalai Lama is found. The Reting Rinpoche continues to hold the Ganden Phodrang steady, confident that his friend the Dalai Lama would be ruined by submission to foreign tutelage, whether from the British Indians, the Chinese, or the Hui Muslims."
POLITICS_DALAI_LAMA_DESC:0 "The child named Lhamo Thondup grew up in the small village of Taktser in Amdo, a highly contentious region. The child was the youngest of seven, including his brother, Thubten Jigme Norbu, who had been recognized as the Takster Rinpoche in 1925. The young Dalai Lama was chosen after the Regent's vision that the new Dalai Lama was born in Amdo. The young Dalai Lama was taken to Lhasa where he will be instructed in the coming years in all aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, and slowly given influence from the regency. "
POLITICS_CHANGRA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1878\n§YPolitical Career:§L\nBorn with the personal name Wangchuk Tharchin, Changra entered government serivce in 1902, eventually serving directly under the Dalai Lama. Changra was given the De-psn rank, and commanded the private bodygaurds of the 13th Dalai Lama. Following the Dalai Lama's passing, Changra was considered for the Commander-in-Chief position of the Tibetan Army, but was passed for the more zealous Trimön. Changra is said to be a sternly political in person, but wields no political influence."
POLITICS_TRIMON_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1874\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nTrimön was born Norbu to a 6th ranked official in Tibet, and took the name Trimön upon his marriage. In 1912, Trimön was assigned as Assistant Commander-In-Chief of the Tibetan Army during the Chinese border crisis. Trimon was one of the few Tibetan diplomats present at the 1914 Simla Convention, and met Lord Hardinge. Trimön returned to Tibet to become the Commissioner of Eastern Tibet, where he irritated the Kashag with his staunch isolationist stance. In the final year of the 13th Dalai Lama, Trimön happened upon the machinations of Lungshar, and personally persuaded the aging Dalai Lama to order Lungshar blinded for his liberal schemes. Trimön used this political affair to become a close confident with the regent, the young Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen. Trimön influenced the young Regent towards his isolationist view of both China and India, and the new Reting Rinpoche reciprocated by appointing Trimön Commander-In-Chief of the Tibetan Army. Recently Trimön has grown noticeably paranoid in his old age."
POLITICS_TAISHI_DONDRUBN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1904\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nTashi Döndrub entered the Tibetan army at a young age in 1924, and used his aristocratic background to attend artillery training in the British Raj. Upon his return in 1930, Taishi was given a prestigious position of Secretary of the Kashag. In 1932 Taishi received additional training commanding machine gun operators, again in the British Raj. Taishi's extensive training allowed him a spot in the bodyguard of the 13th Dalai Lama. In 1933 Taishi was made general of a second experimental Dmag-Sgar division, the second after Thuben Kunphela's. Taishi's talent for new technology was recognized by the Reting Rinpoche in 1935, who made him Minister of Salt and Tea tax."
POLITICS_DINGJA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1896\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn with the personal name Dorji Gyaltsen, Dingja was one of the potential candidates of the celebrated 'Rugby Four' to be sent for overseas education. After not being selected, Dingja became Postmaster-General of Tibet in 1917. Dingja attached himself to the rising star Tsarong by marrying his sister. This status made him able to arrange for advanced gunnery training in the British Raj, as well as lessons in English and Hindu. Dingja was appointed General in 1923, and was demoted in 1925 due to his liberal viewpoints. Following the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Dingja attempted to organize the purchase of weapons from the British Raj, but was denied by the new Commander-In-Chief, Trimön. To ensure that Dingja did not upset Lhasa further, Trimön assigned Dingja in 1935 to lead the Dob-Dobs of Shigatse, ostensibly to protect them from a possible return of the Panchen Lama."
TIB_HUANG_MUSONG_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1884\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA student of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and instructor at Whampoa Primary School, Huang Musong's career seemed to veer just out of relevance to national politics. During the Xinhai Revolution, Huang was appointed to the National Defense Inspection Commission and went to Mongolia and Xinjiang. Afterwards Huang attempted to enter Beiyang politics by becoming the Director of the Route Review Committee of the Ministry of Transport, but was ultimately reassigned back to Xinjiang in 1927, and his inactivity Northern Expedition only diminished Huang's reputation. Huang spent several more years in service of the underground KMT in Xinjiang, where he made contact with Sheng Shicai and Jin Shuren. Huang's reports to the Left KMT stating that both administrators were suitable patriots remains unchallenged within the Party. Huang visited Tibet after the 13th Dalai Lama's death in 1934, and found that most of the potential allies of the KMT were expelled to Bharatiya. After some time in Sikkim, Huang returned to the KMT's headquarters in preparation of the next revolution, and was appointed a chairman of the defunct Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. "

### Ideas ###
TIB_struggle_tibet:0 "The Struggle for Tibet"
TIB_struggle_tibet_desc:0 "At the moment, Tibet’s government is stuggling with exiled revolutionaries and reformers competing for control of the country. This has inhibited the Ganden Phodrang's ability to govern the Tibetan people, and increased the disconnect between average Tibetan freemen with serfs and the nobility."

TIB_struggle_tibet2:0 "Aristocracy Unsettled"
TIB_struggle_tibet2_desc:0 "The religious and civil offices of Tibet, from the Yigtsang to Kashag, are currently struggling to deal with the imprisonment of the 5th Reting Rinpoche. Many civil servants are goind without pay, and several Thubtens are refusing to pay their feudal dues to Lhasa. Without this money the Ganden Phodrang struggles to enact any meaningful reforms."

TIB_struggle_tibet3:0 "Aristocracy Resettled"
TIB_struggle_tibet3_desc:0 "Through politcal capital, The Young Tibet Party has sucessfully gained the trust of the Thubtens and civil servants of Tibet.

TIB_monastic_governance:0 "Monastic Governance"
TIB_monastic_governance_desc:0 "Much of the Tibetan countryside is comprised of monastic fiefs. These areas are quite autonomous from the Tibetan government, and operate as states unto their own, having their own armies and tax collection services.

TIB_monastic_governance2:0 "Monastic Primacy"
TIB_monastic_governance2_desc:0 "Much of the Tibetan countryside is comprised of monastic fiefs. These areas are quite autonomous from the Tibetan government, and operate as states unto their own, having their own armies and tax collection services. The Ganden Phodrang has been able to leverage the monasteries for additional levies and taxes to aid in our national interest."

TIB_dob_dobs:0 "Dob-dobs Recruitment"
TIB_dob_dobs_desc:0 "The main form of peacekeeping in the countryside are the Dob-dobs, warrior monks recruited by the monasteries to protect their holdings.

TIB_dob_dobs_trad:0 "Dob-dobs Tradition"

TIB_dob_dobs_trad2:0 "Dob-dobs Galvanized"
TIB_dob_dobs_trad2_desc:0 "Warrior monks have been sucessfully appraised by Lhasa, and a new more rigid structure implemented to better protect our lands.

TIB_dob_dobs_purged:0 "Dob-dobs Purged"
TIB_dob_dobs_purged_desc:0 "The leadership of these warrior monks have been sucessfully retired and replaced by our loyal men. It may take some time for our loyal political ambassadors to convince the rest of the Dob-dobs of the value of better training."

TIB_serfdom2_desc:0 "In order to relieve political pressure from the south and east, the Regent has benevolently decided to emancipate all the serfs working directly in the Ganden Phodrang's estates.

This will make it more difficult to asset our soverignity over land outside our control."

TIB_theosophy:0 "Theosophical Society"

These laws influence the historic and social processes in human life and unless humanity realizes this, life cannot be improved. The universe is the immense spiritual-energy system in which a man plays the most important role. Moral perfection, strict observance of ethical laws, and comprehension of the key factor that is culture in the wider development of human society are all basic principles of the spiritual and historical development of humanity. As such, it is impossible to build a better future without respecting knowledge, culture, art, science, and these absolut cosmic laws, so they must be enshrined in man’s law here on Earth and spread to the masses so all will learn the true and moral way to live."

In tandem, faith and art shall be our voice and our message, spreading the will of our ideology and our desire to peacefully unite humanity in a culturally and spiritually evolved fashion exemplifying true epigenesis.

The Maitreya that was promised who will usher in a new golden age and open the gates to Shambhala that does truly exists between the veil of existence, accessible from both our physical world and the spiritual world beyond us. Under Nicholas Roerich, this golden age that was promised has been achieved, and our people rejoice as humanity slowly comes to accept their idyllic fate. Though we still must labor endlessly to ensure paradise does not fall, we have created a utopia-in-progress that even the heavens shall sing for. "

TIB_Crown_Of_World:0 "The Crown of the World Atop Roerich’s Head"
TIB_Crown_Of_World_desc:0 "At the world’s ceiling, so close he himself can almost see the gods, Nicholas Roerich stands as the most powerful man in Tibet, ruling not as a bloodthirsty authoritarian, but a benevolent and peaceful, pious and just totalitarian working with the will of the universe backing him to unite mankind and to save our shared history. Still loyal to the Dalai Lama, his family, the wider clergy and Buddhist faith, and all his subjects under him, Roerich has decided to continue his paternalistic rule over the nation, keeping the Himalayas in the palm of his hand so that he can personally guide it to the physical gates of Shambhala were a golden age everlasting awaits mankind."

### Non-ideological Trad ###

TIB_Turn_From_Lenin:0 "Turn From Lenin’s Bloodied Hands"
TIB_Turn_From_Lenin_desc:0 "Unable to come to terms with the massive amount of blood Lenin accumulated on his hands during his failed uprising that spiraled into civil war - a fear realized once again when the Communards in France, England, and Italy torn their nations apart chasing a similar sense of utopianism Roerich once held - Nicholas Roerich has decided to leave ideology out of the Roerichian ideal, instead seeking a path to utopia with faith, tradition, science, and the rest of human achievement coalesced into a unified whole without the bloody taint of radicalism, revolutionary actions, or ideological fanaticism."

TIB_Practical_Idealism:0 "Roerichism as Esoteric Practical Idealism"
TIB_Practical_Idealism_desc:0 "Used by figures like Mahatma Gandhi and John Dewey before Nicholas Roerich adopted the term, Practical Idealism describes a non-ideological philosophy that holds it to be an ethical imperative of any human, especially those in power or with the means to do it, to spread moral virtue and implement ideals of unbiased, unarguable good. Linked to ideas like humanitarianism, charity, social teachings, and more, Roerich has created his own form of the philosophy fused with his own syncretic views on spirituality, culture, and socio-economics, creating a cohesive and non-ideologically biased or tainted civic thoughtform. This thoughtform, supported by the esoteric and occultist beliefs of his family and his reverence for tradition and protecting nature and humanity’s past will lead the nation into a bright, rational, and spiritually evolved future free of ideological constraints, bias, and infighting."

TIB_Traditionalist_Reach:0 "Reach Out to the Traditionalists"
TIB_Traditionalist_Reach_desc:0 "The Traditionalists of Tibet and some of the democratic forces in the nation like the Young Tibetans or the Union of Happiness may have despised the Leftist reputation of Roerich, but with his non-ideological position reaffirmed, these fellow keepers of Tibet’s traditional Buddhist ways would be the ideal allies for us giving forward, granting us a unified political front from which to act from without worry of backlash from potential rivals like the TIP."

TIB_Peaceful_Reformation:0 "A Peaceful Reformation Guided by Piety"
TIB_Peaceful_Reformation_desc:0 "Pacifism must be adhered to, and our dedication to never repeating the bloody mistakes of Lenin and other political revolutionaries like him must be upheld. There is only one way to reform society, and that is slowly over time with care to the past and to tradition while still caring for the needs of all along the way. Humanism and social reform must come and it must come now, for we must care for all people if we can safely take our slow time building a non-radical utopia. As such, we shall begin a system of humanitarian reforms aimed at providing a basic and healthy existence to all of our citizens regardless of their class or social standing as in line with Agni Yoga philosophy, while keeping within the bounds of Tibet’s traditions the entire way. Once the masses can breathe a sigh of relief and focus on their spiritual evolution instead, so can we as we labor to build utopia. We shall follow this path, kept in line by our piety and adherence to the Buddhist faith that supports the Himalayas as we walk beneath the gods in their heavenly temples just out of our reach."

TIB_Roerichist_Theocracy:0 "The True Roerichist Theocracy"
TIB_Roerichist_Theocracy_desc:0 "With the Buddhist clergy of Tibet backing them, the Roerich family and their allies now dominate the theocracy of traditionalist Tibet, and so too does their esoteric and occultist Roerichist philosophy. A theocratic government unbound by political bias now paternalistically rules over the nation like a caring and all-knowing father, slowly working to build a true utopia for all humanity. Guided by the traditional rites and rules that the locals have abided by for centuries, we stand with faith, tradition, and piety under Roerich, the Dalai Lama, and the Gelug school of Buddhism in order to open the doors to Shambhala."

TIB_Traditonal_Virtue:0 "The Ethical Imperative of Traditional Virtue"
TIB_Traditonal_Virtue_desc:0 "Laws and moral codes based around our pursuit of good virtue must be passed down to all in the nation if we are to truly move past the innate human inclination for violence, tribalism, nationalism, and other petty dividers that seek to keep humanity from the truth of enlightenment. Bound by Buddhist morals and the rules of traditional Tibetan society, we will build a better, more virtuous world based on the true good and real ethics that humanity was always meant to live by."

TIB_True_King:0 "By Will of Tibet’s True King"
TIB_True_King_desc:0 "Here at the top of the world, Nicholas Roerich’s influence may be strong and his ideology ever-present, but there is still one person in Tibet he shall always kneel to - the Dalai Lama. This reincarnation demigod among men shall also be at the top of our society and as the true political and spiritual face of the nation. Though Roerich and his family shall always be there to guide the Dalai Lama and all future ones as his own family is enshrined as its own reincarnating tulku line alongside the Panchen Lama and other secondary tulkus, the Dalai Lama will always be the true king of Tibet."

### Lefty Roerich ###

TIB_Justify_Lenin:0 "Walk Lenin's Red Path to Shambhala"
TIB_Justify_Lenin_desc:0 "Coming to terms with the idea that sometimes radicalism and revolutionary actions are the only way to push society along towards utopia, even if it means getting your hands bloody, Lenin did what had to do in order to try and save his people, and as such, we must do the same. No longer embroiled in inner conflict, Roerich knows what must be done. He shall be the herald of the Red Mahatma’s revolutionary ideology and spirit, and by his side, humanity shall be guided towards an egalitarian Buddho-Communist utopia. "

TIB_Esoteric_Communism:0 "Roerichism as Esoteric Buddho-Communism"
TIB_Esoteric_Communism_desc:0 "Called Buddho-Communism by his close friends in Russia during the early stages of the failed revolution, Roerich fuses organizational methods and hierarchical design from the Buddhist clergy in Tibet with Bolshevik Communist, Anarcho-Syndicalist, and wider Socialist ideology in order to create a Party organization that truly has one foot in the physical and political realm of man, and the other in the spiritual realm of Buddhist philosophy. These ideas, supported by our metaphysical teachings and spiritualist, cosmicist truths shall uplift the proletarian masses to pious and egalitarian paradise."

TIB_Soviet_Saints:0 "Honor the Bolshevik Saints and their Teachings"
TIB_Soviet_Saints_desc:0 "Vladmir Lenin, Yakov Sverdlov, Leon Trotsky, Gustave Courbet, and other Bolshevik or Socialist martyrs that have died fighting for what they believe in as they try to save humanity with Internationalism and egalitarian, utopian Leftist ideas must be honored and their teachings respected and followed. Not only will they be raised as new saints in the pantheon of wider humanity, for their art, writings, and theories shall be spread by the state and their ideology shall be incorporated into our growing Internationalist front for human unity."

TIB_TIP_Allies:0 "Work with Our Allies in the TIP"
TIB_TIP_Allies_desc:0 "Climbing to the top of Tibet with their help, the Tibet Improvement Party is a key ally in our crusade to bring utopia to the Himalayas and beyond. We shall absorb the party and their members, making them all full allies within our government, clergy, and bureaucracy in order to utilize their skills and ideas for the good of all in the nation."

TIB_Centralist_Theocracy:0 "A Democratic Centralist Theocracy"
TIB_Centralist_Theocracy_desc:0 "Functioning like a Communist party from Europe with our own Far East twist, our red theocracy shall function along the lines of democratic centralism, with elected members of the clergy and socialist bund behind us serving the state as its directors for the masses. With Socialists, Buddhist leaders, Pan-Asian theorists, Leftist academics, Traditionalist theologians, and other similar figures from around the world invited to join this growing government, we shall build a regime of the people and by the people of the party - a party to truly represent, enlighten, and guide humanity to Buddho-Communist utopia."

TIB_Buddhist_Bolshevism_desc:0 "In order to keep our form of Bolshevism in check and at peace, protecting our people, our environment, and ourselves from revolutionary violence and other breaches of our principles as pacifists, we shall bind Bolshevism with Buddhist morality and the cosmic laws we hold so dear. This shall ensure that violent repressions and bloody revolutionary action never takes place under our watch, for we must be better than those who came before us if we are to succeed at opening the doors to Shangri-La."

TIB_Red_Mahatma:0 "By the Will of the Immortal Red Mahatma"
TIB_Red_Mahatma_desc:0 "The physical form of Vladmir Lenin may be gone, but his immortal spirit as the Red Mahatma shall always live on as the true leader of the Roerichist movement. Though Nicholas Roerich and Lenin’s living brother Dmitry Ilyich Ulyanov shall remain the leading mortal servants of this immortal deity, functioning as the unquestionable and blessed instruments of Lenin’s will in this mortal plane, Mahatma Lenin and the other Buddhist deities and Bolshevik martyr saints shall always have the head seat at the table in our crimson theocracy, being the official head of state and face of the nation as Roerich and the clergy work behind the scenes to build the way to Shambhala."

TIB_Soviet_Shangri_La_desc:0 "In order to progress towards our dream of a united humanity, we must follow Lenin’s dream of creating a union of Socialist states bound together by the common goal of creating a Leftist utopia.

#Events

tib.1.t:0 "The Regency and The Tibetan People"
tib.1.d:0 "In 1936, Tibet is embroiled in a bitter leadership dispute. The 13th Dalai Lama died in 1933, leaving 5th Reting Rinpoche, Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen, as his regent until a new Dalai Lama can be found. As the leadership struggle unfolded, the Reting Rinpoche was instated as the Regent, however he serves as only a figurehead of the chaotic government. Four main factions unfolded in the conflict, Lungshar’s Kyicho Kuntun, The Panchen Lama's Tibet Improvement Party, Tsarong’s Young Tibet, and the Traditionalists, led by Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen and Trimön. The rest of the central government of Tibet, referred to as the Ganden Phodrang, is occupied by a collection of appointed officers both theocratic and civil. The Rinpoche are high ranking Buddhist monks that are confirmed by the public to be reincarnations of previous important monks. The Kashag is a four-way council traditionally appointed by civil servants, but after 1933 has been controlled by Marshal Trimön. The Thubten are feudal landowners that hold significant sway in the more prosperous eastern half of Tibet in Khampa. The people of Utsang, while still loyal to the Ganden Phodrang, are suffering from neglect and bandits coming out of Xinjiang and Kashmir."
tib.1.a:0 "We will persevere"

tib.2.t:0 "Restoration of the Dalai Lama"
tib.2.d:0 "The Regent has announced today that the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has been restored to his rightful place as Head of State of Tibet. Although his power is mostly ceremonial and concentrated with other government members, he is finally here. The search has ended."
tib.2.a:0 "May he live ten thousand years!"

tib.10.t:0 "The Regents Vision"
tib.10.d:0 "Sitting on the shore of the lake Lhamo La-tso lake, the Regent has had a vision of the new Dalai Lama. Through a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it, the vision took the Regent to a hill to the east. Opposite to the hill stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The eaves of this house were distinctive of houses in Amdo. The vision ends, and the Regent awakens to alert the lamas of their journey."
tib.10.a:0 "A Journey to Amdo!"

tib.11.t:0 "Preparing for the Journey"
tib.11.d:0 "Despite the intense political disruption of the past few months, the Taktra Rinpoche has remained loyal to the government, although the Kwetsng Rinpoche has sequestered himself in Kham,after refusing to join the Reting Rinpoche's government in 1932. Once the Kwetsang Rinpoche is added to their team, they must enter the Ma's territory in Amdo to retrieve the Dalai Lama. The feuding Ma family will surely not notice an expedition if it is done quickly, however waiting may bring harm to the next Dalai Lama, just as neutrality before Trimön caused the deaths of thousands of Golok Tibetans in 1921."
tib.11.a:0 "Now for the escort"

tib.12.t:0 "The Company of the Lamas"
tib.12.d:0 "It appears that the Ma family feud is still confined primarily to Qinghai and Ningxia, meaning most of their forces will be preoccupied. Our commander in chief recommends a detachment of elite Dmag-Sgar regulars, which would ensure no Ma patrol could harm the expedition. The Regent, however, does not recall any military encampment in his vision, and insists that a small escort will suffice. A small collection of Lamas in the Ganden Phodrang, all from Amdo, have professed that no escort will be safer than any escort, as they have been able to visit Amdo in recent years in disguises. The choice ultimately falls to the Regent."
tib.12.a:0 "Faster with no escort"
tib.12.b:0 "Bring a small escort"
tib.12.c:0 "No less than two thousand guards"

tib.13.t:0 "Meeting the Kwetsang Rinpoche"
tib.13.d:0 "The expedition has reached Gyêgu Monastery, outside of Yushu. The Kwetsang Rinpoche has been coordinating an effort there to protect Tibetans from the Ma family. The Kwetsang Rinpoche has reported that he has narrowed down the candidates for the Dalai Lama to three children, and is struggling currently to ensure the Tibetans of Amdo continue to follow their buddhist traditions, lest another fish incident occur, when in 1924 the Lamas of Amdo abandoned their vegetarian diet while meeting westerners, and nearly caused the 13th Dalai Lama to die of imprudence. The Kwetsang Rinpoche would be invaluable in ensuring that each child be tested accurately, at the same time the thought of the new Dalai Lama dying because his fellow Tibetans did not adhere to their monastic vows is frightening."
tib.13.a:0 "Wish him well"
tib.13.b:0 "Send him home"

tib.14.t:0 "Meeting A Poor Farmer"
tib.14.d:0 "Whilst enroute to the foretold destination in Yushu, the Lamas’ happened upon the ruins of a desolate village, the smoldering piles of burnt wood and dirt craters turned up little evidence as to what had happened here. It was not until a day later, whereupon the company encountered a refugee caravan, that the truth revealed itself. Recent raids from the Ma Clique have annihilated large parts of the Yushu countryside, forcing the peasants to flee north-west, where they are being huddled into militarily occupied villages. While some refugees have hope of moving past the military checkpoints, others have more vengeful ambitions. One of the poor, destitute farmers that the Lamas’ caravans passed struck up a conversation with the monastic lords, whilst eyeing their collection of guns, food and ammunition. It did not take long for this refugee to steer the conversation in the direction of what Lhasa can do to aid the downtrodden in Yushu. Perhaps, smuggling weapons and supplies to the northbound refugees will put the Ma Clique in for a surprise... On the other hand, it may very well compel the Ma Warlords to treat the refugees even more harshly, if they have reason to suspect them to be partisans."
tib.14.a:0 "Help Him"
tib.14.b:0 "Move Along"

tib.15.t:0 "Ma Forces Encounter Escort"
tib.15.d:0 "Not long after passing the refugee caravan, the Lamas laid eyes upon one of the very villages they had been warned of. Squalid hamlets, stitched together tents and an air of misery surrounded the tiny settlement, which was brimming with guards proudly flying the Ma Clique’s red and white flag. To many of the locals which had been relocated here, even the war-torn province of Gansu may be preferable to this. The mention of Gansu filled the Kwetsan Rinpoche with a sudden realisation. A smaller stream of refugees had been moving west, in an attempt to settle near Liulin village and avoid the northern checkpoints. By following this alternative route, then veering north into the wilderness for a few days, the Lamas’ caravan could likely avoid the military checkpoints. As the guards near the occupied village began to eye the caravan suspiciously, the Kwetsan Rinpoche guided his comrades west, soon ordering them into a full blown march to maintain one step ahead of the Ma Clique patrol’s pursuit!"
tib.15.a:0 "Run!"

tib.16.t:0 "Visiting Kumbum Monastery"
tib.16.d:0 "Although it has severely tired his men, and the enemy soldiers have mercilessly hounded them west, the journey to Amdo draws ever closer to its destination. After a couple of days along the trail to Liulin, the Ma Patrols eventually gave up the chase, unleashing their greed and wrath upon some other caravan of helpless innocents. A few more days north through the wilderness, and the Lamas’ caravans finally reached Kumbum Monastery, earning them a long rest in the company of friends and allies. The Monastery, which is ranked second only to Lhasa in terms of spiritual importance, has remained untouched by the Ma Clique’s forces. The great temple of Je Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school, is simply too sacred of a shrine even for nonbelievers and warlords to pillage, even though they have attempted to sow divides between the Gelug school and the Nyingma school by meddling in Kumbum’s affairs. Despite this, the Monastery welcomed the Caravan with open arms and helped guide them in the direction of Taktster, showing that there was still some brotherly love between the schools."
tib.16.a:0 "We're getting closer"

tib.17.t:0 "Reaching the Village of Taktser"
tib.17.d:0 "The Caravan entered the village of Taktser with a heavy heart. Out of the three names of children in Yushu the Kwetsang Rinpoche gave to the Regent, the first two were not him. The first child, in another village, was already deathly ill when the Caravan encountered him. The second child who was shown the items of the 13th Dalai Lama ran away, hopefully to his parents. This village was home to Thubten Jigme Norbu, a young child who had been chosen for nobility in 1921. Hopefully here we will find the Dalai Lama."
tib.17.a:0 "A non-tibetan village? Interesting"

tib.18.t:0 "Testing the Boy of Taktser"
tib.18.d:0 "A child was brought out to view the items of the 13th Dalai Lama who had demonstrated knowledge of Lhasan Tibetan. This child was repeatedly allowed to pick out an item from a set display, and every time he chose a former memento of the 13th Dalai Lama. In the few days the Regent has been in Taktster, the child has demonstrated incredible calmness to the strife broiling to the north. This child could be the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama."
tib.18.a:0 "The boy that lived...."

tib.19.t:0 "This is the Dalai Lama!"
tib.19.d:0 "With time running short, the Regent has consulted his thoughts. Truly the weight of the brewing conflict between the Ma Clique would leave so many more children destitute, even destroy towns like Takster. The child would certainly not survive the war. Ultimately the weight of all of Buddhism is impressed into the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. The child is the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and is thus the most precious symbol of Tibetan hope in this world."
tib.19.a:0 "Now Make haste to Lhasa"

tib.20.t:0 "The Qinghai Army Approaches Taktser"
tib.20.d:0 "Before the Caravan could depart from Takster, a guide reported that the Qinghai army was nearby. Every measure must be taken to keep the Dalai Lama out of the hands of the Ma Clique, for they have no kindness for Buddhists, and we can only counter their aggression with our own. The Regent has taken the Dalai Lama to hide at a nearby farmhouse, hopefully the Qinghai soldiers will stray elsewhere."
tib.20.a:0 "Hide the boy"
tib.20.b:0 "Hide the boy, the escort will distract them"

tib.21.t:0 "The Dalai Lama Hides"
tib.21.d:0 "Hiding in a nearby farm, the caravan containing the new Dalai Lama hides. Although the Qinghai Army spent several days in Taktser, the loyalty of the residents to our cause meant that the army could do nothing but search. After two days, the Qinghai Army passed out of Takster, and the caravan could start on their return journey in earnest."
tib.21.a:0 "The coast is clear"

tib.22.t:0 "The Dalai Lama Reaches Lhasa"
tib.22.d:0 "After a month of travel, the caravan containing the Regent and Dalai Lama have returned safely to Lhasa. Upon their return, the Regent gave a speech to the Lamas outlining the incredible danger posed to Buddhists in Amdo, including the very real threat posed by the Qinghai army. The Lamas, once sanguine in their positions, have begun agitating the Kashag towards war with the Ma Clique once again, fearful that another massacre like the one committed against the Golok people was imminent."
tib.22.a:0 "Safe at last"

tib.23.t:0 "Preparing the Procession of Lamas"
tib.23.d:0 "The 13th Dalai Lama suffered from both the shackles of imperialism and the apathy of the Buddhist world, which was exacerbated by hisd time in exile. In order to ensure that this Dalai Lama is protected and exalted by Buddhists all across Asia, a larger ceremony is necessary, one with western observers. Firstly our friends in the Gelug School must be gathered from their far flung reaches, from Mongolia, Tuva and Kalmykia. These Lamas will be the first to exalt the Dalai Lama before he is given the larger audience. The danger of invasion also means that, should Tibet fall, our Gelug allies can best coordinate a plan to save the Dalai Lama."
tib.23.a:0 "Invite the Mongols, Tuvans, and Kalmyks"

tib.27.t:0 "Direction of Tibet Military Reform"
tib.27.d:0 "We need to decide the direction of our Army. Two paths lay for the Tibetan Army. The first direction is to focus on the Dob-dobs and make it more rigid and make it more meritocratic. Another direction is to focus on a more modern and regular Army. This will require purging the Dob-dobs and reducing their influence in government. What path shall be chosen?"
tib.27.a:0 "The Dob-dobs can be reformed"
tib.27.b:0 "A regular army is needed"

tib.28.t:0 "Dmag-Sgar Empowered to Regulars"
tib.28.d:0 "Decades after the first Dmag-Sgar regiment was organized under the 13th Dalai Lama, the Army of Tibet is finally fully modernized. Like most reforms in Tibet, this change comes from the top-down, starting with our finance minister and continuing to our officers first. Hopefully larger divisions will enable us to defend better against the modernized armies to the east."
tib.28.a:0 "Finally"

tib.29.t:0 "Young Tibet Party Leaves Lhasa"
tib.29.d:0 "After being demoted, General Tsarong Dzasa has been a thorn in [TIB.GetLeader]'s side. Tsarong Dzasa has been agitating in Lhasa to escalate our diplomatic relations with the British in Delhi, even as their power has waned following their syndicalist revolution. Thankfully Tsarong Dzasa and his Young Tibet party didn't support the blind Lungshar, who made his revolutionary intentions known in Kham, deserving of his blindness."
tib.29.a:0 "We may need to blind Dzasa as well."

tib.30.t:0 "Tibet Improvement Party Spotted in Shigatse"
tib.30.d:0 "Rumors circulating among the Dob-dobs that visit the Ganden Phodrang allege that the Nepalese border has seen an increase in tax resistance. This can only mean one thing, that the 9th Panchen Lama is plotting against the Regency again. The Panchen Lama was exiled a decade ago for resisting the 13th Dalai Lama's tax collection, and his domain in Shigatse was rightfully seized by the Ganden Phodrang to pay back taxes. Until The Panchen's name appeared on copies of 'The Three Principles of the People' in Tibet, it was assumed that the Panchen Lama was still living in Mongolia."
tib.30.a:0 "Send guards to the Nepalese border"

tib.31.t:0 "[TIB.GetLeader] Grapples with Refugees"
tib.31.d:0 "The Regent, [TIB.GetLeader], has publicly reiterated his promise to protect West Xikang from the Sichuan clique. The people of West Xikang are so grateful to the Gaden Phodrang for liberating them from Chinese imperialism. [TIB.GetLeader] also spoke of how they shall continue to protect the Golok people, but they also spoke of avenging their loss inflicted upon them by the Qinghai Army."
tib.31.a:0 "We will keep you safe"

tib.32.t:0 "Young Tibet Party Arrives in Utsang"
tib.32.d:0 "Reports of General Tsarong Dzasa's insidious YTP have made a fresh set of promises to the people of Utsang. The Young Tibet Party has apparently promised the peasants liberation from banditry should Tsarong Dzasa be elevated to Regent. The Young Tibetans are not shy claiming a new Regent and the demotion of our most esteemed Trimön will allow Tibet to modernize faster. We owe the continued independence for Tibet to the right guidance of Trimön and [TIB.GetLeader], both of whom are deeply offended by Tsarong's politicking."
tib.32.a:0 "That is nearly seditious speech"

tib.33.t:0 "Tibet Improvement Caught Entering Through the Nepalese Border"
tib.33.d:0 "Nepalese monks have reported being accosted by radical Thubtens in the border regions of Nepal. What distinguishes the Thubtens is their promotion of Indian Socialist and Sun Yat-Sen rhetoric. Surely these radicals are the rumored Tibet Improvement Party, an easily transparent Indian plot to overthrow the Ganden Phodrang and bring in atheistic socialism. Although these mountain paths are out of our jurisdiction to intervene, the Ganden Phodrang can lean on the Nepalese government to help disperse these socialist agitators."
tib.33.a:0 "Nepal wouldn't help socialists, would they?"

tib.34.t:0 "Tibet Asks Us to close our Border"
tib.34.d:0 "The Tibetan Regent claims the Tibet Improvement Party is secretly crossing from Bharatiya to Tibet through mountain paths within our nation. At some cost we can send troops there to ensure our relations with Tibet do not deteriorate. At the same time we could ignore this possibly spurious theory of theirs."
tib.34.a:0 "Close the border."
tib.34.b:0 "Tibet cannot order us around!"

tib.35.t:0 "Nepal Agrees to Close Their border"
tib.35.d:0 "Without any access to Tibet, the Tibet Improvement Party is apparently trying to pull their forces across the Himalayas back into the Bharatiya Commune. Hopefully this time they shall remain in exile."
tib.35.a:0 "The liberal snake is gone!"

tib.36.t:0 "Nepal Refuses to Close Their Border"
tib.36.d:0 "The Tibet Improvement Party has continued to grow in the border regions of Nepal and it seems to have grown bold enough to finally cross into Tibet. We cannot mobilize the Dmag-Sgar out of Lhasa in time, but the Dob-dobs can be deployed in time to counter the rebels. The Dob-dobs can either be sent to hunt the Tibet Improvement militants in Kham province, or try to stem the flow of traitors coming in through Nepal. Marshal Trimön believes a hunt for Khampa allies will shock the Tibet Improvement into retreating once more, while his understudy General Changra believes a direct assault along the Nepalese border is both necessary and legally justified."
tib.36.a:0 "Send Dob-dobs to the Nepalese Border"
tib.36.b:0 "Send the Dob-dobs to Kham"

tib.37.d:0 "The militia of the Tibet Improvement Party reportedly ambushed Dob-dobs patrolling in Kham and have taken some as prisoners. Following this victory the Tibet Improvement Party along with their militia horde appear to be carving a path towards Sichuan. Monks in the Ganden Pradong believe they can stop the Tibet Improvement's charge by pressuring all loyal Tibetans to ostracize the rebels, while Trimön believes the Dob-dobs in Kham could defeat them if ordered to."

Our monks are reporting that Tsarong Dzasa has recently won a string of victories against Turkic bandits, and is making a circus of his victories to the humble people of Utsang. Trimön recommends we send the Dmag-Sgar, the unit Trimön inherited from Thubten Kunphela, to make a bigger show of chasing Turks out of Utsang. However, this could be playing into Dzasa's plan to embarrass us, and [TIB.GetLeader] believes the Utsang Dob-dobs are merely lazy and need explicit orders to do their jobs. "

tib.45.t:0 "Dmag-Sgar Interrogate Bandits, British Collusion"
tib.45.d:0 "Shocking news came through Lhasa as Trimön paraded several Ughier prisoners through the streets. In front of his home, Trimön reported that the Ughier bandits confessed that they were being armed by the British Indian army. Furthermore, they were instructed to raid Utsang in order to raise a bounty for their Ottoman masters back in Kashgar. To the people of Utsang, this revelation fell neatly in line with the growing discontent over the violence in Xinjiang. To many in the crowd, this could even foretell the Kalachakra tantra, which promises a holy war between all muslims and all Buddhists some day."

tib.46.d:0 "A surprise parade in Lhasa drew out a large crowd, hoping it was another one of Trimön's pronouncements. Instead, at the head of the parade was Tsarong Dzasa, with a group of Ughier prisoners. The most astonishing sight was a troop of Indian and Afghan riflemen, led by a British man. Tsarong introduced this guest to the crowd as General Philip Neame, and proclaimed that they had joined forces during a battle and captured many Ughier bandits. From the Potala palace, Trimön watches on in horror."

tib.47.d:0 "The terrible embarrassment Trimön brought to Lhasa that day could not be forgotten. After wandering out of the Potala palace, Trimön was discovered by the crowd in a white robe, something far too pedestrian for his reputation. Upon being spotted, Trimön gave a dumb expression and looked upon his subjects as if they were strangers, then attempted to leave Lhasa. The crowd, believing him insane, captured Trimön and placed him under house arrest. The Khenchen Lobsang Tashi will now serve as Prime Minister, and the Reting Rinpoche has graciously stepped down from the Regency in favor of Tsarong Dzasa."

Already posters for various candidates have started to pop up in Lhasa and other major cities. Much ado is being made of the three candidates, especially the opposition leaders Nicholas Roerich and Lungshar. Lungshar's detractors still claim the aristocrat plotted to sell Tibet to foreigners, likewise with the foreign-born Roerich. Roerich's status as a candidate in the Tibetan elections is shaky, but has seen strong support from Tibetans living in exile in Bharatiya. Fortunately for Roerich's supporters, the Indian revolutionary militias have protected him and ensured his stay in Lhasa."

tib.49.t:0 "Kyicho Kuntun Promises Moderation"

The Tsongdu Gyendzom consists of abbots and ex-abbots of the three biggest Gelugpa monasteries. This will separate the secular government from the Gaden Phodrang allowing them to represent us diplomatically. The supporters of the Kyicho Kuntun also claim that the incumbent Tibet Improvement Party is detrimental to Tibet through their dependence on the Chinese KMT. At the same time, the Kyicho Kuntun denounces the Sacred Union Party as a front for Indian socialism to impose itself on Tibet."

With the 14th Dalai Lama still far too young to represent the people of Tibet on his own, it falls to the Kashag to delineate his roles in this new revolutionary environment. [TIB.GetLeader], compelled by attractive revelations and supported by the Bharatiyan establishment, has begun to question the absolute legitimacy of the young child as the new Dalai Lama. According to Roerich, revelations occurring across Tibet and India point towards there being a 9th Dalai Lama living, not a 14th. These objections are drawing a lot of criticism from Kham and Amdo, but the Khampa people seem to support this assertion."

tib.125.d:0 "In order to spread the truth of Agni Yoga to the wider wall, Roerich and his family worked to plan an international conference for the wider esoteric world to behold. Wanting his own world to be united by his ideas, Roerich worked to plan an academic, aesthetic, and artistic event truly refined and perfect in every way in order to showcase our nation as the paragon of culture and physical manifestation of Shambhala for all his friends to partake in. Inviting all of his close friends and correspondence throughout both the East and West, figures like Tashi Namgyal, the Dalai Lama, the Bogd Gegen, Cuong De, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Onisaburo Deguchi, Ryohei Uchida, Gada Meiren, Ja Lama, Edward Longstreet Bodin, J. R. R. Tolkien, Henry Wallace, Karl Wiligut, Heinrich Himmler and the rest of the Ahnenerbe from Germany, delegates from the Ariosophist movement in Austria, the Yamato Dynasty, the Neo-Sycthians in Russia, and the Spiritualist Party in the Pacific States of America, and from Howard Philips Lovecraft, the Omnipotent Oom the Magnificent Pierre Arnold Bernard, and Lothrop Stoddard in New England, the American President and other world leaders of import, and so many more, Roerich invited half the world and nearly all invited were in attendance as figures likes these and many more came to show appreciation to Roerich and his family as they performed and proselytized to them all. Getting into a levitation contest with William Dudley Pelley, Papa Kimbangu, and Sun Ra before painting in unison with Picasso, Dali, and Kahlo as Lovecraft wrote nervously about the whole affair, the extravagant bash was one to be remembered by all, and served to spread our message while cementing the Roerichist philosophy into the hearts and minds of the world’s most influential cultural titans."

Finally passing away at the age of 73, his tulku soul shall reincarnate somewhere in this mortal plane, and hopefully within the Roerich family or the Tibetan Buddhist clergy. Regardless, we shall always abide by the path he laid down for us, but we must prepare the government and nation to move on. We must scour the land and look for the signs of his reincarnation so we may continue the next steps towards utopia and the gates of Shambhala, but for now we need to decide which member of the Roerich family will become the patriarch of the Roerichist philosophy of Agni Yoga."

Backed by many of the great powers and funded by the Roerichs’ vast array of international backers and allies, the Roerich Pact will keep the past and future of human history secure and safe while promoting peaceful unity of the human race.

When not in Lhasa, the nation is run by our unique theocracy and other close allies dedicated to our ideology, ensuring that the nation is always in sound hands while the Roerichs trek their way across the planet’s most isolated regions in order to behold the true beauties this world and human race can offer. From Antarctica to the Congo, from the native tribes of the American Plains to the jungles of the Yucatan, the peaks of the Andes, the depths of the Amazon, or the icy shores of Alaska and the North Pole, all of the Earth shall be explored and their wonders recorded by our devoted leaders, for no culture, history, art, or other human creation shall ever be destroyed and lost again."

tib.129.d:0 "With Nicholas Roerich’s decision to work with the nationalist group headed by Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln, the Roerichist movement has begun to take a noticeably Right-wing slant. By drawing influence from North American and European Spiritualists, members of the German Ahnenerbe and earlier Thule Society, the Edda Society, Germanic Ariosophists and Armanists, Japanese Pan-Asian nationalists like those from the Black Dragon Society, and more, the movement’s new influences are surely of a more reactionary variety compared to Roerich’s last influence of Lenin. Working with Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln and his clique of Right-wing esoterics including the likes of Ernst Schafer, Bruno Berger, Karl Maria Wiligut, Theodor Czepl, Hans F. K. Gunther, Karl Wolff, Werner von Bulow, Emil Rudiger, Rudolf John Gorsleben, Hans Schleif, Wilhelm Unverzagt, Heinrich Himmler, Richard Walther Darre, Yrjo von Gronhagen, Walther Wust, Herman Wirth, Wilhelm Teudt, Herbert Jankuhn and many more of their dubious ilk, Roerich will attempt to continue to ignore all ideology and pursue pacifism with their help, but if pressure and beliefs will influence Roerichism remains to be seen. Meanwhile, we shall pursue our conception of a traditionalist and humanitarian utopia that provides everything for all citizens so they may focus on their individual spiritual enlightenment, and these new allies shall be the new political vehicle that carries us to that paradise."

We could either invite Lenin’s living brother Dmitry Ilyich Ulyanov - a fellow Communist currently out in Crimea - to lead as a living avatar of his brother’s will and grace, or we could stand by the immortal spirit and soul of Lenin himself, with Roerich guiding the nation behind the guise of the everliving ethereal visage of Vladmir Lenin the Everlasting Buddha and Red Mahatma of our faith.

We could instead pursue a mixture of radical Socialist and Bolshevik views, inspired by Bukharin and the Narodists among others like the Anarcho-Pastoralist, or we could pursue Anarcho-Syndicalism and Unionism, for it has proven to be quite successful in France, England, and America.

From Altai and Tuva to Mongolia and Buryatia, the Buddists of the Far East shall have a new metropolis to look towards as we build this shining city upon the hill so that one day all of humanity may rejoice and live a life of peace and prosperity beyond its doors. As we labor to build this new holy city of new Zvenigorod, we must decide if we shall move our political and administrative infrastructure into this city under construction or if we shall wait for paradise to be fully built before moving there, keeping the capital in Lhasa until such a time."

Before us are three possible allies, first of which is the Kyicho Kuntun (Union of Happiness) movement and their colleagues the Young Tibetans, who we could work with to establish local democracy and humanistic reforms while adhering to our wider ideology of non-ideological traditionalism so that the people are cared for as Roerich builds utopia. Alternatively, we could work with our long-held allies in the clergy and among the pious nobility of Tibet, working together to build a truly traditionalist paradise without ideology or radicalism brick by brick. Finally, we could work with the esoteric nationalists of Chao Kung - or Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln - and his allies Ernst Schafer and Bruno Beger in order to build our esoteric paradise with the power of immense foreign backing from possibly questionable sources.

Once opposed to Lenin’s violent revolution and initially supportive of the Whites before moving from Russia and to America before finally coming back to Tibet, Roerich has gone back and forced on his stance towards Socialism and revolutionary actions. He agrees there is merit in doing everything in your power to help push stubborn mankind towards utopian unity, but using such wonton violence and needless death of the innocents or degradation of the natural environment to do so is deplorable. As such, Roerich must finally decide on the future of his burgeoning philosophy and choose a path between Lenin-inspired Buddho-Communism and traditional esoteric cultural and social epigenesis free of ideology under a paternalistic system of practicalist idealism."

However, many suggest that the Roerich administration should fill in as regent until the young boy is of age, taking the role from the normal clergy in order to share the burden and immerse the young Tenzi Gyasto in the ways of Roerichian thought. Alternatively, we could stand formally behind the infantile demigod and serve his needs from the shadows. What shall we do to organize this traditionalist state?"

This situation attracts many curious individuals, academics, astronomers, celestial occultists, and more from all over the globe; one of these people being Milan Rastislav Štefánik, a very passionate astronomer, aviator, and a politician from Central Europe. Some may say that our mountainous and frigid terrain that shields our lush valleys is too dangerous to traverse for people who are not used to it, but this didn't stop Štefánik, who had previous experience with bad terrain during his expedition to Mount Blanc many years ago and his similar expeditions in ranges like the Tartras and the Alps. A passionate but amateurish Tibetologist who has come to the Himalayas after studying cultures around the planet from Europe to Africa, Štefánik has also come to study with local monks and has provided aid to many a local Tibetan in need. With this figure from afar and others like him like Charles Alfred Bell, Hugh Edward Richardson, Rolf Stein, Jacques Bacot, Giuseppe Tucci, Luciano Petech, and more, Tibet truly is blessed by the strangest but most earnest people from around the globe.

tib.148.t:0 "The Unimportant Plight of Cosmic Rubbish"
tib.148.d:0 "As part of his philosophy, Roerich talks about unnecessary sentimentality towards people. He states that there should only be a desire to contribute to the spiritual and cultural evolution, or epigenesis, of mankind. ‘Living Corpses’ as he calls the individual should not be seen as obstacles to humanity’s greater good, for their individual wants and needs as ‘cosmic rubbish’ comes secondary to the good of the wider masses. Living creative spirits, and not shadows disappearing from life, should evoke a desire to help and guide humanity on The Path as dictated by the mahatmas. A person, a family, a people, a race, the humanity of the planet, the humanity of the entire planetary system - everything is subject to the same law and so is TIbet. The cosmic rubbish between nations is in a period of spiritual dying - the same living corpse as an individual person with the life of the spirit extinguished in him, wandering through the cemetery of the past - and so we must reverse this mass dying with the peaceful Pax Cultura and our enlightened truth. We shall still be humanitarians of aesthetic virtue, but there shall be no sentimental feelings about the individual human and their ant farm societies that do not seek to reverse this dying with us, for only the spiritual and cultural evolution of wider humanity along the path of the Great Plan and the Pax Cosmica matters in the end."
tib.148.a:0 "Merely ants we must look past if epigenesis on a global scale can come to pass."

tib.149.d:0 "With the nationalist clique of the shyster Trebitsch-Lincoln now in charge of the nation, a sole leader must be decided upon and a direction must be chosen. What great power shall we turn to for funding as we chase Shambhala, and what great truth must be bend to in order to create an earthly paradise for our chosen people; these are the questions we must answer by choosing who among us shall lead us into the new age for our cosmic root race. Now devoid of Leftists or Centrism taint and propelled by nationalism, Right-wing esotericism and the shared occultist ideas of our allies like the Pan-Asians, Ariosophists, Spiritualists, Scientific Racialists, and more shall lead us to the gates of Shangri-La and beyond, for all of humanity shall bend to our true will, even if we must espouse racial and cultural purity over others to see it done."

tib.150.t:0 "Roerich’s Contacts in America"
tib.150.d:0 "Linked to figures and friends in America like Henry Wallace, Howard Philips Lovecraft, Edward Longstreet Bodin, the late John Muir, Cora Scott, the Fox Sisters, and many more, Roerich and his family hold deep ties to the American Left and Spiritualist movements. With these deep connections in mind, we must decide if we should include these friends peacefully in our push towards global unity, allying with them for the betterment of all mankind or leaving them to face our justice all the same as the rest of the world. Regardless of what we choose, all the world will feel our Buddho-Communist truth eventually."
tib.150.a:0 "Ally America for the Roerichist cause."
tib.150.b:0 "Maintain friendly relations but avoid entanglement."

tib.151.t:0 "Our Connections to Russian Esoterics"
tib.151.d:0 "A contemporary of Roerich who wished to travel to Tibet to find Shambhala before Roerich’s own journeys, Alexander Barchenko is a famed biologist and researcher of anomalous phenomena that worked with the likes of fellow allies to Roerich like Gleb Bokii and was known for being the first prominent academic to search for Shambhala - or what he called Hyperborea in his studies - in Russia. A mystic, expert researcher, and fanatical Tibetanologist known as the 'Red Merlin' to his fellow esoterics, Barchenko shall be welcomed into our government along with thinkers and cosmicists like him - including Gleb Bokii, Mikhail Gerasimov, Vladimir Kirllov, Alexander Bogdanov, Vladimir Vernadsky, Alexander Chizhevsky, Nikolai Kozyrev, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Hans Fleischhacker, other disciples of Tsiolkovsky and Fyodorov, and even Roerich's old Bolshevik friend from university Georgy Chicherin - creating a growing academia of occultist, metaphysical, and paranormal genius to help bring utopia to the state."
tib.151.a:0 "We shall be uplifted by their genius."

tib.152.t:0 "Forcing Roerichism Across Our Realm"
tib.152.d:0 "The epigenesis, or spiritual and cultural evolution of all mankind that Roerich and his philosophy hope to bring about, is a delicate process with many intricacies, and the wider Roerichian thoughtform must be carefully explained and prosthelytized to the masses willing to learn from such a truth, while the rest of the cosmic rubbish must be swept aside for the greater good. Seeking to personally be a vehicle for this epigenesis and wider spread of his own ideas, Roerich and his family make numerous speeches throughout the country while organizing and hosting seances, spiritual sessions, creative unions and cooperative art installations and more in monasteries and tribal halls throughout Tibet, though the efficacy of such public appearances can be debated, with most of his speeches being met with blank or confused stares and the unimaginative sighs of disinterest of true cosmic rubbish. Though a large bulk of the masses may not yet grasp our genius, this matters not for the will of cosmic rubbish who have succumbed to the idea of a life and spiritual existence without energy, hope, art, or creativity has no bearing on The Path to a utopia under the Agni Yoga and Roerich’s philosophy."
tib.152.a:0 "Humanity and its path to perfection matters, individual humans and their wants do not."

tib.153.t:0 "Dzongs and Dob-Dobs for Our Master"
tib.153.d:0 "In order to have a new design space, center of his regime’s power, and chief monastery for his own unique philosophy and pious genius, Nicholas Roerich has comissioned the creation of a new traditional Dzong fortress to be built along his own specifications and based on his own fusion of traditional Tibetan and Roerichian architecture. Though the great and ancient Potala Palace itself in Lhasa has already fallen under his domain and total control, Roerich still desires a new fortress built to his specifications in a more isolated region of the Himalayas. Choosing a range of mountain in an isolated region along a fertile and lush hidden valley, the mighty and impressive new Dzong of Roerich shall be erected, complete with its own gardens, monasteries, art galleries, workstations, libraries, altars, yoga studios for the practice of Agni Yoga, and other ornately decorated halls, serving as the utopian home of his personal Dob-Dob guard decorated in Roerichian regalia based in a fortress matching their spiritual aesthetic and the genius art of their master. From this new fortified and blazing heart of our movement, we shall bring about humanity’s true epigenesis without fail!"
tib.153.a:0 "From here, true art and genius shall flow."

tib.154.t:0 "An Invitation to the Roerich Pact"
tib.154.d:0 "We have received a delegation from the enigmatic Nicholas Roerich to join the Roerich Pact, formally called the Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments. Formerly an internationally-backed scientific and cultural organization aimed at the preservation of human history and archeological artifacts, the organization has now recently been transformed into a military alliance. Roerich seeks to unite like minded nations towards international cooperation in addition to preserving the world’s unique cultures and history, but his esoteric beliefs and occultist views have turned some away from his goal of peaceful human cooperation. What should our response be?"
tib.154.a:0 "Count us in!"
tib.154.b:0 "Maintain cordial relations but refuse Roerich's offer."

tib.155.t:0 "A Coming of Age for Our Heavenly Connection"
tib.155.d:0 "Long has the 14th Dalai Lama - Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso - lived under the dominance of our new government and our traditional assistants of the Tibetan Kashag, functioning as a spiritual beacon but largely lacking in political power due to our policies and his young age. The Kashag - the council of monks called the Kalöns that have dominated Tibet’s politics since 1721 - dominates the Ganden Phodrang (Tibet’s traditional government structure) and has served as our local and loyal link to the people of Tibet, aiding us in our struggle to rule and bring utopia to Tibet, but they now have a special request. With the 14th Dalai Lama Gyalwa Rinpoche - known more commonly to the wider world as Tenzin Gyatso - has recently come of age, growing into a deeply spiritual and wise young man with a sharp mind and a desire to bring Buddhist peace and enlightenment to his fellow man. As such, the Kashag has requested that we fully honor the Dalai Lama’s claim to being the true Head of State of Tibet, granting him some semblance of power over our government with his desire to create a new and modern constitution for our people."
tib.155.a:0 "The Dalai Lama is the true king of Tibet. We stand by this request!"
tib.155.b:0 "He shall have his constitution and semblance of power, but we are truly in charge."
tib.155.c:0 "The Dalai Lama is the true king of Tibet. We stand by this request!"

tib.157.t:0 "Fly Us to Mars, Comrade Zander"
tib.157.d:0 "Originally from Riga, the Baltic-German commoner Friedrich Zander was immersed in and fascinated by the natural sciences from a young age due to his upbringing as a doctor’s son, eventually rising to become one of Russia’s earliest pioneers of rocketry and spaceflight, while also being an amateur but beloved science fiction author in his off-time. Always holding a fascination with Mars, Zander remarked that ‘the red star’, as he liked to call it, was the very symbol of our grand soviet experiment for all of humanity to behold as Earth’s crimson twin, cosmic neighbor, and destiny as a future second home among the stars, even writing a few short sci-fi stories about the Red Planet, including one where he himself travels to Mars on vacation while collecting messages there and recounting his experiences for us Earthlings back home. \n\nFor more tangible and useful endeavors, Zander is the founder of the Group for the Study of Reactive Motion - or GIRD - which is Russia’s preeminent scientific bureau for the study of space travel, rocketry, and other scientific fields having to do with space, as well as GIRD’s predecessor the Society for Studies of Interplanetary Travel which was the first intellectual group to suggest the idea of using the Earth’s atmosphere as a way of braking during re-entry, while also being the inventor of the first liquid-fueled rocket ever designed and launched in Russia. Additionally, Zander has written numerous journals and theoretical works on numerous space-centric fields while creating many feasible concepts our planned cosmonaut program will eventually test if our Revolution finally and wholly succeeds, including inventing the ‘solar-sail’ concept of photon-based propulsion, though a similar concept was first put to pen by the great Johannes Keppler back in the 17th century using theorized solar winds, as well as the concept of a gravity-assist or gravitational-slingshot in his 1925 paper ‘Problems of Flight by Jet Propulsion in Interplanetary Flights’. A man of many talents, Comrade Friedrich Zander is committed to our Aesthetic Revolution as a fellow dreamer, and with his help and our generous funding, we shall take to the stars in the decades to come, while his current advances in the natural sciences - particularly in experimental rocketry with his OR/GIRD line of working liquid-fueled rockets - shall bring the future blasting down to the present in order to defend and advance the proletarian dream."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_NICHOLAS_ROERICH_DESC: "Raised by the aristocratic Roerich family of St. Petersburg, Nicholas has expressed interest in both the aesthetic and spiritual side of socialist revolution. This interest led Nicholas first into the Arts, where he graduated from St. Petersburg University and the Imperial Academy of the Arts in 1897. Nicholas became immersed in Russian avant garde art, which included working with the legendary Igor Stravinsky and Vaslav Nijinsky. The October Revolution ended the social peace that Nicholas had known, and set Nicholas closer to social conservatism and orientalism in opposition to Vladimir Lenin.\nNicholas Roerich fled to the United States and joined the Theosophical Society, a spiritual movement that shared Roerich's admiration of undeveloped nations as 'more spiritually pure' than westernized counterparts. Roerich visited the Theosophical Society in both the Bharatiya Commune and British Dominion in 1930, and had a startling conversation with Gandhi. Gandhi expressed to Roerich that Vladimir Lenin was not against traditional culture, but against corrupt leaders of traditional institutions.\nNicholas Roerich decided to take his family to visit Tibet through the Shimla mountains, and received a second calling in the mountains. A sherpa guiding Roerich remarked 'Is it true, that Lenin was not against Buddhism?' This led to a religious experience in Nicholas, which ended the expedition when he spoke of this in Lhasa. Nicholas began describing Vladimir Lenin as 'Mahatma Lenin' and was forced to leave Tibet by the Ganden Phodrang for this heretical idea. Back in Bharatiya, Nicholas was alerted to a possible revolution in Tibet emanating from Sikkim. In Sikkim, Nicholas Roerich combined his revelations with an endorsement from Gandhi to form the Sacred Union Party, a revolutionary party dedicated to saving Tibetan Buddhism through Esoteric Leninism."
POLITICS_9TH_PACHEN_LAMA_DESC: "The 9th Panchen Lama was born Choekyi Nyima into the Thuben class in Shigatse, Tibet. Raised and educated by the prestigious Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, the young Choekyi Nyima was predestined to be the 'Great Scholar' under the Dalai Lama, and was for a time well respected by the Ganden Phodrang. As a young scholar, the 9th Panchen Lama met with radical lama Agvan Dorzhiev, who taught him the Prayer to Shambhala. This prayer was intended to collect the allies of Buddhism together to the center of the world, the fictional city of Shambhala. Political realities came in 1924 when the 13th Dalai Lama was modernizing his army. The Dalai Lama demanded more taxation from the Panchen Lama as part of his feudal duties. When the Panchen Lama refused, The Dalai Lama cut off the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and confiscated the Panchen Lama's property. The resulting conflict forced the Panchen Lama to flee Tibet to Mongolia in 1924.\nThe Panchen Lama, seeing Mongolia as unable to aid in his return under Baron Ungern, left for Bharatiya in 1931. In Bharatiya, the Panchen Lama connected with the other exiled Tibetan nobles Pandatsang Rapga and Thubten Kunphela. These two exiles had connection in Kham, and had aligned themselves with exiled KMT generals to form the Tibet Improvement Party. The Panchen Lama, seeing no other way to return to Tibet save for an invasion, joined the Tibet Improvement Party and began publishing commentaries of Sun Yat Sen's Three Principles of the People. The storm of the revolution saw the Panchen Lama promise to preserve the existence of the Ganden Phodrang while removing their ability to choose the Kashag."
POLITICS_TSIPON_LUNGSHAR_DESC: "Tsipön Lungshar comes from a family that has served the Dalai Lama since the 18th century, and has deep connections to Lhasa. Lungshar was chosen to supervise the elite education of four nobles called the 'Rugby Four' in the UK prior to the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Lungshar stood in between the more radical nobles like Thuben Kunphela and Trimön in the early years of the Regency. It was Lungshar who accused Thuben Kunphela of orchestrating a foreign infiltration of Tibet in 1933, leading to his exile. However, Lungshar also opposed the power of the Regency, especially their strongman Trimön. Trimön orchestrated a trial where Lungshar was accused of being a socialist, then blinded before being exiled to Sikkim. The revolution saved Lungshar's life, and enabled him to return to Tibet and found the Kyicho Kuntun, a moderate political party that wishes to balance the needs of democracy with the traditions of Tibet."
POLITICS_TSARONG_DZASA_DESC: "When the 13th Dalai Lama decided to modernize the army in 1923, he put nobleman Tsarong Dzasa in charge of the newly created Dmag-Sgar. Tsarong previously had a very successful career leading the Dob Dobs in defending Tibet from the Qing during the Xinhai revolution. Defeating the Qing earned Tsarong the name 'Hero of Chaksam', and he used his popularity to increase the national budget for Tibet's army. This indirectly caused the expulsion of the Panchen Lama in 1924. The death of the 13th Dalai Lama left the country in the control of the Regency, led by the 5th Reting Rinpoche and Trimön. Tsarong was demoted from Commander-In-Chief to Civil Engineer and Treasurer, but this failed to stop his popularity. Trimön was initially happy when Tsarong left for Utsang, along with his Young Tibet movement, but now Trimön sits in the Potala prison while Tsarong has effectively assumed his position. The 5th Reting Rinpoche now only serves as Regent unable to leave the Ganden Phodrang until the 14th Dalai Lama is revealed."
POLITICS_JAMPHEL_YESHE_GYALTSEN_DESC: "Thubten Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen, nobleman, friend to the 13th Dalai Lama, and Regent of Tibet. The 5th Reting Rinpoche presided over a tumultuous period in Tibetan history, one that saw numerous exiles, tortures, and heavy reliance on the Commander-In-Chief Trimön to stay in power. The Reting Rinpoche stood behind Trimön's continuation of the tax increases, and stands as the most legitimate leader of Tibet until the 14th Dalai Lama is found. The Reting Rinpoche continues to hold the Ganden Phodrang steady, confident that his friend the Dalai Lama would be ruined by submission to foreign tutelage, whether from the British Indians, the Chinese, or the Hui Muslims."
POLITICS_DALAI_LAMA_DESC: "The child named Lhamo Thondup grew up in the small village ot Taktser in Amdo, a highly contentious region. The child was the youngest of seven, including his brother, Thubten Jigme Norbu, who had been recognized as the Takster Rinpoche in 1925. The young Dalai Lama was chosen after the Regent's vision that the new Dalai Lama was born in Amdo. The young Dalai Lama was taken to Lhasa where he will be instructed in the coming years in all aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, and slowly given influence from the regency. "
POLITICS_CHANGRA_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1878\n§YPolitical Career:§L\nBorn with the personal name Wangchuk Tharchin, Changra entered government serivce in 1902, eventually serving directly under the Dalai Lama. Changra was given the De-psn rank, and commanded the private bodygaurds of the 13th Dalai Lama. Following the Dalai Lama's passing, Changra was considered for the Commander-in-Chief position of the Tibetan Army, but was passed for the more zealous Trimön. Changra is said to be a sternly political in person, but wields no political influence."
POLITICS_TRIMON_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1874\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nTrimön was born Norbu to a 6th ranked official in Tibet, and took the name Trimön upon his marriage. In 1912, Trimön was assigned as Assistant Commander-In-Chief of the Tibetan Army during the Chinese border crisis. Trimon was one of the few Tibetan diplomats present at the 1914 Simla Convention, and met Lord Hardinge. Trimön returned to Tibet to become the Commissioner of Eastern Tibet, where he irritated the Kashag with his staunch isolationist stance. In the final year of the 13th Dalai Lama, Trimön happened upon the machinations of Lungshar, and personally persuaded the aging Dalai Lama to order Lungshar blinded for his liberal schemes. Trimön used this political affair to become a close confident with the regent, the young Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen. Trimön influenced the young Regent towards his isolationist view of both China and India, and the new Reting Rinpoche reciprocated by appointing Trimön Commander-In-Chief of the Tibetan Army. Recently Trimön has grown noticeably paranoid in his old age."
POLITICS_TAISHI_DONDRUBN_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1904\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nTashi Döndrub entered the Tibetan army at a young age in 1924, and used his aristocratic background to attend artillery training in the British Raj. Upon his return in 1930, Taishi was given a prestigious position of Secretary of the Kashag. In 1932 Taishi received additional training commanding machine gun operators, again in the British Raj. Taishi's extensive training allowed him a spot in the bodyguard of the 13th Dalai Lama. In 1933 Taishi was made general of a second experimental Dmag-Sgar division, the second after Thuben Kunphela's. Taishi's talent for new technology was recognized by the Reting Rinpoche in 1935, who made him Minister of Salt and Tea tax."
POLITICS_DINGJA_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1896\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn with the personal name Dorji Gyaltsen, Dingja was one of the potential candidates of the celebrated 'Rugby Four' to be sent for overseas education. After not being selected, Dingja became Postmaster-General of Tibet in 1917. Dingja attached himself to the rising star Tsarong by marrying his sister. This status made him able to arrange for advanced gunnery training in the British Raj, as well as lessons in English and Hindu. Dingja was appointed General in 1923, and was demoted in 1925 due to his liberal viewpoints. Following the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Dingja attempted to organize the purchase of weapons from the British Raj, but was denied by the new Commander-In-Chief, Trimön. To ensure that Dingja did not upset Lhasa further, Trimön assigned Dingja in 1935 to lead the Dob-Dobs of Shigatse, ostensibly to protect them from a possible return of the Panchen Lama."
TIB_HUANG_MUSONG_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1884\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA student of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and instructor at Whampoa Primary School, Huang Musong's career seemed to veer just out of relevance to national politics. During the Xinhai Revolution, Huang was appointed to the National Defense Inspection Commission and went to Mongolia and Xinjiang. Afterwards Huang attempted to enter Beiyang politics by becoming the Director of the Route Review Committee of the Ministry of Transport, but was ultimately reassigned back to Xinjiang in 1927, and his inactivity Northern Expedition only diminished Huang's reputation. Huang spent several more years in service of the underground KMT in Xinjiang, where he made contact with Sheng Shicai and Jin Shuren. Huang's reports to the Left KMT stating that both administrators were suitable patriots remains unchallenged within the Party. Huang visited Tibet after the 13th Dalai Lama's death in 1934, and found that most of the potential allies of the KMT were expelled to Bharatiya. After some time in Sikkim, Huang returned to the KMT's headquarters in preparation of the next revolution, and was appointed a chairman of the defunct Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. "

TIB_struggle_tibet: "The Struggle for Tibet"
TIB_struggle_tibet_desc: "At the moment, Tibet’s government is stuggling with exiled revolutionaries and reformers competing for control of the country. This has inhibited the Ganden Phodrang's ability to govern the Tibetan people, and increased the disconnect between average Tibetan freemen with serfs and the nobility."

TIB_struggle_tibet2: "Aristocracy Unsettled"
TIB_struggle_tibet2_desc: "The religious and civil offices of Tibet, from the Yigtsang to Kashag, are currently struggling to deal with the imprisonment of the 5th Reting Rinpoche. Many civil servants are goind without pay, and several Thubtens are refusing to pay their feudal dues to Lhasa. Without this money the Ganden Phodrang struggles to enact any meaningful reforms."

TIB_struggle_tibet3: "Aristocracy Resettled"
TIB_struggle_tibet3_desc: "Through politcal capital, The Young Tibet Party has sucessfully gained the trust of the Thubtens and civil servants of Tibet.

TIB_monastic_governance: "Monastic Governance"
TIB_monastic_governance_desc: "Much of the Tibetan countryside is comprised of monastic fiefs. These areas are quite autonomous from the Tibetan government, and operate as states unto their own, having their own armies and tax collection services. While this makes for a weaker central government, the self-reliant communities offer a degree of stability and community."

TIB_monastic_governance2: "Monastic Primacy"
TIB_monastic_governance2_desc: "Much of the Tibetan countryside is comprised of monastic fiefs. These areas are quite autonomous from the Tibetan government, and operate as states unto their own, having their own armies and tax collection services. The Ganden Phodrang has been able to leverage the monasteries for additional levies and taxes to aid in our national interest."

TIB_dob_dobs: "Dob-dobs Recruitment"
TIB_dob_dobs_desc: "The main form of peacekeeping in the countryside are the Dob-dobs, warrior monks recruited by the monasteries to protect their holdings.

The Dob-dobs are the bread-and-butter of our military."

TIB_dob_dobs_trad: "Dob-dobs Tradition"

TIB_dob_dobs_trad2: "Dob-dobs Galvanized"
TIB_dob_dobs_trad2_desc: "Warrior monks have been sucessfully appraised by Lhasa, and a new more rigid structure implemented to better protect our lands.

TIB_dob_dobs_purged: "Dob-dobs Purged"
TIB_dob_dobs_purged_desc: "The leadership of these warrior monks have been sucessfully retired and replaced by our loyal men. It may take some time for our loyal political ambassadors to convince the rest of the Dob-dobs of the value of better training."

TIB_serfdom: "Institutionalized Serfdom"

TIB_serfdom2: "Alleviated Serfdom"
TIB_serfdom2_desc: "In order to relieve political pressure from the south and east, the Regent has benevolently decided to emancipate all the serfs working directly in the Ganden Phodrang's estates.

This will make it more difficult to asset our soverignity over land outside our control."

TIB_theosophy: "Theosophical Society"

#Events

tib.1.t: "The Regency and The Tibetan People"
tib.1.d: "In 1936, Tibet is embroiled in a bitter leadership dispute. The 13th Dalai Lama died in 1933, leaving 5th Reting Rinpoche, Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen, as his regent until a new Dalai Lama can be found. As the leadership struggle unfolded, the Reting Rinpoche was instated as the Regent, however he serves as only a figurehead of the chaotic government. Four main factions unfolded in the conflict, Lungshar’s Kyicho Kuntun, The Panchen Lama's Tibet Improvement Party, Tsarong’s Young Tibet, and the Traditionalists, led by Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen and Trimön. The rest of the central government of Tibet, referred to as the Ganden Phodrang, is occupied by a collection of appointed officers both theocratic and civil. The Rinpoche are high ranking Buddhist monks that are confirmed by the public to be reincarnations of previous important monks. The Kashag is a four-way council traditionally appointed by civil servants, but after 1933 has been controlled by Marshal Trimön. The Thubten are feudal landowners that hold significant sway in the more prosperous eastern half of Tibet in Khampa. The people of Utsang, while still loyal to the Ganden Phodrang, are suffering from neglect and bandits coming out of Xinjiang and Kashmir."
tib.1.a: "We will persevere"

tib.2.t: "Restoration of the Dalai Lama"
tib.2.d: "The Regent has announced today that the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has been restored to his rightful place as Head of State of Tibet. Although his power is mostly ceremonial and concentrated with other government members, he is finally here. The search has ended."
tib.2.a: "May he live ten thousand years!"

tib.10.t: "The Regents Vision"
tib.10.d: "Sitting on the shore of the lake Lhamo La-tso lake, the Regent has had a vision of the new Dalai Lama. Through a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it, the vision took the Regent to a hill to the east. Opposite to the hill stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The eaves of this house were distinctive of houses in Amdo. The vision ends, and the Regent awakens to alert the lamas of their journey."
tib.10.a: "A Journey to Amdo!"

tib.11.t: "Preparing for the Journey"
tib.11.d: "Despite the intense political disruption of the past few months, the Taktra Rinpoche has remained loyal to the government, although the Kwetsng Rinpoche has sequestered himself in Kham,after refusing to join the Reting Rinpoche's government in 1932. Once the Kwetsang Rinpoche is added to their team, they must enter the Ma's territory in Amdo to retrieve the Dalai Lama. The feuding Ma family will surely not notice an expedition if it is done quickly, however waiting may bring harm to the next Dalai Lama, just as neutrality before Trimön caused the deaths of thousands of Golok Tibetans in 1921."
tib.11.a: "Now for the escort"

tib.12.t: "The Company of the Lamas"
tib.12.d: "It appears that the Ma family feud is still confined primairly to Qinghai and Ningxia, meaning most of their forces will be preoccupied. Our commander in chief recommends a detachment of elite Dmag-Sgar regulars, which would ensure no Ma patrol could harm the expedition. The Regent, however, does not recall any military encampment in his vision, and insists that a small escort will suffice. A small collection of Lamas in the Ganden Phodrang, all from Amdo, have professed that no escort will be safer than any escort, as they have been able to visit Amdo in recent years in disguises. The choice ultimately falls to the Regent."
tib.12.a: "Faster with no escort"
tib.12.b: "Bring a small escort"
tib.12.c: "No less than two thousand guards"

tib.13.t: "Meeting the Kwetsang Rinpoche"
tib.13.d: "The expedition has reached Gyêgu Monastary, outside of Yushu. The Kwetsang Rinpoche has been coordinating an effort there to protect Tibetans from the Ma family. The Kwetsang Rinpoche has reported that he has narrowed down the candidates for the Dalai Lama to three children, and is struggling currently to ensure the Tibetans of Amdo continue to follow their buddhist traditions, lest another fish incident occur, when in 1924 the Lamas of Amdo abandoned their vegetarian diet while meeting westerners, and nearly caused the 13th Dalai Lama to die of imprudence. The Kwetsang Rinpoche would be invaluable in ensuring that each child be tested accurately, at the same time the thought of the new Dalai Lama dying because his fellow Tibetans did not adhere to their monastic vows is freightening."
tib.13.a: "Wish him well"
tib.13.b: "Send him home"

tib.14.t: "Meeting A Poor Farmer"
tib.14.d: "Whilst enroute to the foretold destination in Yushu, the Lamas’ happened upon the ruins of a desolate village, the smoldering piles of burnt wood and dirt craters turned up little evidence as to what had happened here. It was not until a day later, whereupon the company encountered a refugee caravan, that the truth revealed itself. Recent raids from the Ma Clique has annihilated large parts of the Yushu countryside, forcing the peasants to flee north-west, where they are being huddled into militarily occupied villages. While some refugees have hope of moving past the military checkpoints, others have more vengeful ambitions. One of the poor, destitute farmers that the Lamas’ caravans passed struck up a conversation with the monastic lords, whilst eyeing their collection of guns, food and ammunition. It did not take long for this refugee to steer the conversation in the direction of what Lhasa can do to aid the downtrodden in Yushu. Perhaps, smuggling weapons and supplies to the northbound refugees will put the Ma Clique in for a surprise... On the other hand, it may very well compel the Ma Warlords to treat the refugees even more harshly, if they have reason to suspect them to be partisans."
tib.14.a: "Help Him"
tib.14.b: "Move Along"

tib.15.t: "Ma Forces Encounter Escort"
tib.15.d: "Not long after passing the refugee caravan, the Lamas laid eyes upon one of the very villages they had been warned of. Squalid hamlets, stitched together tents and all around air of misery surrounded the tiny settlement, which was brimming with guards proudly flying the Ma Clique’s red and white flag. To many of the locals which had been relocated here, even the war-torn province of Gansu may be preferable to this. The mention of Gansu filled the Kwetsan Rinpoche with a sudden realisation. A smaller stream of refugees had been moving west, in an attempt to settle near Liulin village and avoid the northern checkpoints. By following this alternative route, then veering north into the wilderness for a few days, the Lamas’ caravan could likely avoid the military checkpoints. As the guards near the occupied village began to eye the caravan suspiciously, the Kwetsan Rinpoche guided his comrades west, soon ordering them into a full blown march to maintain one step ahead of the Ma Clique patrol’s pursuit!"
tib.15.a: "Run!"

tib.16.t: "Visiting Kumbum Monastery"
tib.16.d: "Although it has severely tired his men, and the enemy soldiers have mercilessly hounded them west, the journey to Amdo draws ever closer to its destination. After a couple of days along the trail to Liulin, the Ma Patrols’ eventually gave up the chase, unleashing their greed and wrath upon some other caravan of helpless innocents. A few more days north through the wilderness, and the Lamas’ caravans finally reached Kumbum Monastery, earning them a long rest in the company of friends and allies. The Monastery, which is ranked second only to Lhasa in terms of spiritual importance, has remained untouched by the Ma Clique’s forces. The great temple of Je Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school, is simply too sacred of a shrine even for nonbelievers and warlords to pillage, even though they have attempted to sow divides between the Gelug school and the Nyingma school by meddling in Kumbum’s affairs. Despite this, the Monastery welcomed the Caravan with open arms and helped guide them in the direction of Taktster, showing that there was still some brotherly love between the schools."
tib.16.a: "We're getting closer"

tib.17.t: "Reaching the Village of Taktser"
tib.17.d: "The Caravan entered the village of Taktser with a heavy heart. Out of the three names of children in Yushu the Kwetsang Rinpoche gave to the Regent, the first two were not him. The first child, in another village, was already deathly ill when the Caravan encountered him. The second child who was shown the items of the 13th Dalai Lama ran away, hopefully to his parents. This village was home to the Thubten Jigme Norbu, a young child who had been chosen for nobility in 1921. Hopefully here we will find the Dalai Lama."
tib.17.a: "A non-tibetan village? Interesting"

tib.18.t: "Testing the Boy of Taktser"
tib.18.d: "A child was brought out to view the items of the 13th Dalai Lama who had demonstrated knowledge of Lhasan Tibetan. This child was repeatedly allowed to pick out an item from a set display, and every time he choose a former memento of the 13th Dalai Lama. In the few days the Regent has been in Taktster, the child has demonstrated incredible calmness to the strife broiling to the north. This child could be the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama."
tib.18.a: "The boy that lived...."

tib.19.t: "This is the Dalai Lama!"
tib.19.d: "With time running short, the Regent has consulted his thoughts. Truely the weight of the brewing conflict between the Ma Clique would leave so many more children destitute, even destroy towns like Takster. The child would certainly not survive the war. Ultimately the weight of all of Buddhism is impressed into the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. The child is the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and is thus the most precious symbol of Tibetan hope in this world."
tib.19.a: "Now Make haste to Lhasa"

tib.20.t: "The Qinghai Army Approaches Taktser"
tib.20.d: "Before the Caravan could depart from Takster, a guide reported that the Qinghai army is nearby. Every measure must be taken to keep the Dalai Lama out of the hands of the Ma Clique, for they have no kindness for Buddhists, and we can only counter their aggression with our own. The Regent has taken the Dalai Lama to hide at a nearby farmhouse, hopefully the Qinghai soldiers will stray elswhere."
tib.20.a: "Hide the boy"
tib.20.b: "Hide the boy, the escort will distract them"

tib.21.t: "The Dalai Lama Hides"
tib.21.d: "Hiding in a nearby farm, the caravan containing the new Dalai Lama hides. Although the Qinghai Army spent several days in Taktser, the loyalty of the residents to our cause meant that the army could do nothing but search. After two days, the Qinghai Army passed out of Takster, and the caravan could start on their return journey in earnest."
tib.21.a: "The coast is clear"

tib.22.t: "The Dalai Lama Reaches Lhasa"
tib.22.d: "After a month of travel, the caravan containing the Regent and Dalai Lama have returned safely to Lhasa. Upon their return, the Regent gave a speech to the Lamas outlining the incredible danger posed to Buddhists in Amdo, including the very real threat posed by the Qinghai army. The Lamas, once sanguine in their positions, have begun agitating the Kashag towards war with the Ma Clique once again, fearful that another massacre like the one comitted against the Golok people was imminent."
tib.22.a: "Safe at last"

tib.23.t: "Preparing the Procession of Lamas"
tib.23.d: "The 13th Dalai Lama suffered from both the shakles of imperialism and the apathy of the Buddhist world, which was exacerbated by hisd time in exile. In order to ensure that this Dalai Lama is protected and exalted by Buddhists all across asia, a larger ceremony is necessary, one with western observers. Firstly our friends in the Gelug School must be gathered from their far flung reaches, from Mongolia, Tuva and Kalmykia. These Lamas will be the first to exalt the Dalai Lama before he is given the larger audience. The danger of invasion also means that, should Tibet fall, our Gelug allies can best coordinate a plan to save the Dalai Lama. "
tib.23.a: "Invite the Mongols, Tuvans and Kalmyk"

tib.27.t: "Direction of Tibet Military Reform"
tib.27.d: "We need to decide the direction of our Army. Two paths lay for the Tibetan Army. The first direction is to focus on the Dob-dobs and make it more rigid and make it more meritocratic. Another direction is to focus on a more modern and regular Army. This will require purging the Dob-dobs and reducing their influence in government. What path shall be chosen?"
tib.27.a: "The Dob-dobs can be reformed"
tib.27.b: "A regular army is needed"

tib.28.t: "Dmag-Sgar Empowered to Regulars"
tib.28.d: "Decades after the first Dmag-Sgar regiment was organized under the 13th Dalai Lama, the Army of Tibet is finally fuly modernized. Like most reforms in Tibet, this change comes from the top-down, starting with our finance minister and continuing to our officers first. Hopefully larger divisions will enable us to defend better against the modernized armies to the east."
tib.28.a: "Finally"

tib.29.t: "Young Tibet Party Leaves Lhasa"
tib.29.d: "After being demoted, General Tsarong Dzasa has been a thorn in [TIB.GetLeader]'s side. Tsarong Dzasa has been agitating in Lhasa to escalate our diplomatic relations with the British in Delhi, even as their power has waned following their syndicalist revolution. Thankfully Tsarong Dzasa and his Young Tibet party didn't support the blind Lungshar, who made his revolutionary intentions known in Kham, deserving of his blindness."
tib.29.a: "We may need to blind Dzasa as well."

tib.30.t: "Tibet Improvement Party Spotted in Shigatse"
tib.30.d: "Rumors circulating among the Dob-dobs that visit the Ganden Phodrang allege that the Nepalese border has seen an increase in tax resistance. This can only mean one thing, that the 9th Panchen Lama is plotting against the Regency again. The Panchen Lama was exiled a decade ago for resisting the 13th Dalai Lama's tax collection, and his domain in Shigatse was rightfully seized by the Ganden Phodrang to pay back taxes. Until The Panchen's name appeared on copies of 'The Three Principles of the People' in Tibet, it was assumed that the Panchen Lama was still living in Mongolia."
tib.30.a: "Send guards to Sikkim"

tib.31.t: "[TIB.GetLeader] Grapples with Refugees"
tib.31.d: "The Regent, [TIB.GetLeader], has publicly reiterated his promise to protect West Xikang from the Sichuan clique. The people of West Xikang are so grateful to the Gaden Phodrang for liberating them from Chinese imperialism. [TIB.GetLeader] also spoke of how they shall continue to protect the Golok people, but they also spoke of avenging their loss inflicted upon them by the Qinghai Army."
tib.31.a: "We will keep you safe"

tib.32.t: "Young Tibet Party Arrives in Utsang"
tib.32.d: "Reports of General Tsarong Dzasa's insidious YTP has made a fresh set of promises to the people of Utsang. The Young Tibet Party has apparently promised the peasants liberation from banditry should Tsarong Dzasa be elevated him to Regent. The Young Tibetans are not shy claiming a new Regent and the demotion of our most esteemed Trimön will allow Tibet to modernize faster. We owe the continued independence for Tibet to the right guidance of Trimön and [TIB.GetLeader], both of whom are deeply offended by Tsarong's politicking."
tib.32.a: "That is nearly seditious speech"

tib.33.t: "Tibet Improvement Caught Entering Through Sikkhim"
tib.33.d: "Nepalese monks have reported being accosted by radical Thubtens in Sikkim. What distinguishes the Thubtens is their promotion of Indian Socialist and Sun Yat-Sen rhetoric. Surely these radicals are the rumored Tibet Improvement Party, an easily transparent Indian plot to overthrow the Ganden Phodrang and bring in atheistic socialism. Although Sikkim is out of our ability to intervene, the Ganden Phodrang can lean on the Nepalese government to help disperse these socialist agitators."
tib.33.a: "Nepal wouldn't help socialists, would they?"

tib.34.t: "Tibet Asks Us to close Sikkim Border"
tib.34.d: "The Tibetan Regent claims the Tibet Improvement Party is secretly crossing from Bharatiya to Tibet through Sikkim. At some cost we can send troops there to ensure our relations with Tibet does not deteriorate. At the smae time we could ignore this possibly spurrious theory of theirs."
tib.34.a: "Close Sikkim"
tib.34.b: "Tibet cannot order us around!"

tib.35.t: "Nepal Agrees to Close Sikkhim border"
tib.35.d: "Without any access to Sikkim, the Tibet Improvement Party are apparently trying to pull their forces across the Himalayas back into the Bharatiya Commune. Hopefully this time they shall remain in exile."
tib.35.a: "The liberal snake is gone!"

tib.36.t: "Nepal Refuses to Close Sikkhim Border"
tib.36.d: "The Tibet Improvement Party has continued to grow in Sikkim and it seems to have grown bold enough to finally cross into Tibet. We cannot mobilize the Dmag-Sgar out of Lhasa in time, but the Dob-dobs can be deployed in time to counter the rebels. The Dob-dobs can either be sent to hunt the Tibet Improvement militants in Kham province, or try to stem the flow of traitors coming in through Sikkim. Marshal Trimön believes a hunt for Khampa allies will shock the Tibet Improvement into retreating once more, while his understudy General Changra believes a direct assault against the Sikkim border is both necessary and legally justified."
tib.36.a: "Send Dob-dobs to the Sikkim Border"
tib.36.b: "Send the Dob-dobs to Kham"

tib.37.t: "Tibet Improvement Milita Defeat Dob-dobs"
tib.37.d: "The militia of the Tibet Improvement Party reportedly ambushed Dob-dobs patrolling in Kham and have taken some as prisoners. Following this victory the Tibet Improvement Party along with their militia horde appear to be carving a path towards Sichuan. Monks in the Ganden Pradong believe they can stop the Tibet Improvement's charge by pressuring all loyal Tibetans to ostracize the rebels, while Trimön believes the Dob-dobs in Kham could defeat them if ordered to."
tib.37.a: "Deploy the Dod Dobs to cut them off"
tib.37.b: "Rely on the Ganden Pradong's word"

tib.38.t: "Our Dob Dob End the Tibet Improvement Push"
tib.38.d: "The Tibet Improvement militia made the foolish mistake of attacking Dob-dobs patrolling Kham. Despite some early victories, the militias retreating into Sichuan were fired upon by Sichuanese border guards, assuming correctly that these were rebels and not our army. With no word from the Sichuanese monasteries, we can assume the militia have been seperated from their foolish revoluionary leaders."
tib.38.a: "We have you now!"

tib.39.t: "Tibet Improvement Militia are routed"
tib.39.d: "After a long chase through Kham, The Panchen Lama and Thubten Kunphela have been captured. The revolutionary leaders were caught by militamen while hiding in an former estate of Thubten Kunphela. The estate has now been liquidated and the traitorous serfs reposessed by the Ganden Phodrang With this victory it looks like the Tibet Improvement Movement is dead. Trimön has another medal to pin on his chest."
tib.39.a: "To the Potala prisons with them!"

tib.40.t: "Tibet Improvement Militia arrive in Longyan"
tib.40.d: "A strange sight befell the Central Committee this morning, as a ragged group of Tibetan soldiers and dignitaries arrived at Longyan, carrying copies of the Three Principles of The People, their leaders have beseeched the Central Committee for a task force to carry out revolution in Tibet. Proudly, the Central Committee has appointed Huang Musong as the General-Advisor of Tibet. Furthermore, the Central Committee has authorized a new division to leave for Lhasa and liberate the Tibetan People from the corrupt Regent and tyrannical Trimön."
tib.40.a: "Take a general and troops to victory!"

tib.41.t: "Tibet Improvement Party Take Lhasa"
tib.41.d: "On a quiet morning, General Trimön was inspecting a guard post outside of Lhasa. Suddenly and without warning, General Trimön was fired upon from the plains. Too slow to raise the alarm, General Trimön was shot dead outside of Lhasa, the most important victory that day of the Tibet Improvement Party, which was able to overrun the city by the next evening. The Reting Rinpoche is now justly inprisoned, and the Ganden Phodrang under watchful occupation. "
tib.41.a: "Our Country is Free!"

tib.42.t: "Young Tibet Party Angered Over Utsang"
tib.42.d: "Tsarong Dzasa's Young Tibet Party is reportedly giving ostentatious speeches throughout Utsang on their plight in Tibet. General Tsarong Dzasa, using his notability from his actions during the Xinhai revolution, promises the end of hunger, banditry, and neglect they blame on the Ganden Phodrang. It is doubtless that this rabble rousing has garnered them support in the region."
tib.42.a: "But they cannot help anyone!"

tib.43.t: "Bandit Raids in Utsang Intensifies"
tib.43.d: "Bandits from the west are a known spectre in Utsang. From the grave decievers like Ja Lama that reportedly built a fortress in the Gobi Desert out of the bodies of his many slaves, to more obvious curs like the Ughiers. Our monks are reporting that Tsarong Dzasa has recently won a string of victories against Turkic bandits, and is making a circus of his victories to the humble people of Utsang. Trimön recommends we send the Dmag-Sgar, the unit Trimön inherited from Thubten Kunphela, to make a bigger show of chasing turks out of Utsang. However, this could be playing into Dzasa's plan to embarass us, and [TIB.GetLeader] believes the Utsang Dob-dobs are merely lazy and need explicit orders to do their jobs. "
tib.43.a: "Deploy the Dmag-Sgar to Utsang"
tib.43.b: "Tell the Dob-dobs to do their jobs!"

tib.44.t: "Dmag-Sgar Find British Guns on Bandits"
tib.44.d: "An elite Dmag-Sgar division has been sent from Lhasa to Utsang to root out Ughier camps in the region. The Ughier rebels, Trimön hopes, will retreat back to Kashgar and the Traditionalists can claim a political victory. Trimön has reported great success, and claims he has found British Lee-Enfield rifles held by the Ughier bandits. There is only one thing this could mean."
tib.44.a: "I knew it! British banditry"

tib.45.t: "Dmag-Sgar Interrogate Bandits, British Collusion"
tib.45.d: "Shocking news came through Lhasa as Trimön paraded several Ughier prisoners through the streets. In front of his home, Trimön reported that the Ughier bandits confessed that they were being armed by the British Indian army. Furthermore, they were intructed to raid Utsang in order to raise a bounty for their Ottoman masters back in Kashgar. To the people of Utsang, this revelation fell neatly in line with the growing discontent over the violence in Xinjiang. To many in the crowd, this could even fortell the Kalachakra tantra, which promises a holy war between all muslims and all buddhists some day."
tib.45.a: "But we got those bastards first!"

tib.46.t: "Dob-dobs Join Young Tibet, March on Lhasa"
tib.46.d: "A suprise parade in Lhasa drew out a large crowd, hoping it was another one of Trimön's pronouncements. Instead, at the head of the parade was Tsarong Dzasa, with a group of Ughier prisoners. The most astonishing sight was a troop of Indian and Afghan riflemen, led by a British man. Tsarong introduced this guest to the crowd as General Philip Neame, and proclaimed that they had joined forces during a battle and captured many Ughier bandits. From the Potala palace, Trimön watches on in horror."
tib.46.a: "We are screwed, people"

tib.47.t: "Trimön Declared Insane, Tsarong Dzasa New Regent"
tib.47.d: "The terrible embarassment Trimön brought to Lhasa that day could not be forgotten. After wandering out of the Potala palace, Trimön was discovered by the crowd in a white robe, something far too pedestrian for his reputation. Upon being spotted, Trimön gave a dumb expression and looked upon his subjects as if they were strangers, then attempted to leave Lhasa. The crowd, beleiving him insane, captured Trimön and has placed him under house arrest. The Khenchen Lobsang Tashi will now serve as Prime Minister, and the Reting Rinpoche has graciously stepped down from the Regency in favor of Tsarong Dzasa."
tib.47.a: "Begone corrupt and insane old men!"

tib.48.t: "Revolutionaries Announce Election in One Year"
tib.48.d: "With the creation of the new constitution, the Kyicho Kuntun, the Tibetan Improvement Party and the Sacred Union parties register to run candidates for the upcoming election. Already posters for various candidates have started to pop up in Lhasa and other major cities. Much ado is being made of the three candidates, especially the opposition leaders Nicholas Roerich and Lungshar. Lungshar's detractors still claim the aristocrat plotted to sell Tibet to foreigners, likewise with the foreign-born Roerich. Roerich's status as a candidate in the Tibetan elections is shaky, but has seen strong support from Tibetans living in exile in Bharatiya. Fortunately for Roerich's supporters, the Indian revoluionary militias have protected him and ensured his stay in Lhasa."
tib.48.a: "Good Luck Everyone"

tib.49.t: "Kyicho Kuntun Promises Moderation"
tib.49.d: "Kyicho Kuntun promises, if elected, they will reopen the Ganden Phodrang and empower the Tsongdu Gyendzom. The Tsongdu Gyendzom consisting of abbots and ex-abbots of the three biggest Gelugpa monasteries. This will separate the secular government from the Gaden Phodrang will still allowing them to represent us diplomatically. The supporters of the Kyicho Kuntun also claim that the incumbent Tibet Improvement Party is detrimental to Tibet through their dependence on the Chinese KMT. At the same time, the Kyicho Kuntun denounces the Sacred Union Party as a front for Indian socialism to impose itself on Tibet."
tib.49.a: "How forgiving on Lungshar"

tib.50.t: "Tibet Improvement Promises Sun Yat-Sen Thought"
tib.50.d: "The Tibet Improvement Party promises that if they are elected to invest in the Kham province. Moreover they shall reform the education system to allow for women to be educated. They pledge to follow the Three Principles of the People of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen. In recent speeches, the Tibet Improvement has had to fend off accusations that they are a front for Chinese interests in Tibet. TIP Chairman Thubten Kunphela has responded by making massive donations of his wealth in Kham to the poor serfs he helped emancipate."
tib.50.a: "This is the good stuff"

tib.51.t: "Sacred Union Promises Lamaist Socialism"
tib.51.d: "The Sacred Union Party promises that if they are elected to bring about Buddhist Socialism explaining that Buddhist Values are socialist values. They promise to land reform to collectivize agriculture and to preserve the material culture of Tibet. They have also announced that they will seek to improve relations with the Bharatiya Commune. Detractors claim the Sacred Union wishes for the eventual subjection of Tibet to the Bharatiyan Commune, and strongly object to the foreign intrusion of Theosophy into Tibet."
tib.51.a: "How Utopian of them"

tib.52.t: "Tibetan Election of [GetYear]"
tib.52.d: "Today is the election for the national legislature. As per the constitution only men can vote but still a number have come out to vote for who shall be the Sikyong of Tibet. The Sikyong, or Prime Minister, is the official title of leadership of the Kashag, which would be awarded to Thubten Kunphela should the TIP retain power. The Young Tibet Party, despite their opposition to Trimön was kept off the ballots. The Kashag has approved of this because the YTP's leader, Tsarong Dzasa, had too much influence in the pre-revolutionary Tibetan military. The question though who shall win the election?"
tib.52.a: "Tibet Improvement"
tib.52.b: "Kyicho Kuntun"

tib.53.b: "Kyicho Kuntun"

tib.54.t: "Womens Sufferage Causes Split in Sacred Union"
tib.54.d: "The vote in Kashag for women’s suffrage has caused a rupture in the Sacred Union Party. The introduction of this policy comes shortly after Nicholas Roerich met with the ambassador to Bharatiya. The Sacred Union party meeting reportedly ended in a riot as Tibetan members left en masse. It is obvious to the observers that the Tibetans refused to vote on the issue of women's sufferage.This has allowed the Tibet Improvement Party to gain influence at the expense of the Sacred Union Party."
tib.54.a: "Tibet Improvement Undisputed"

tib.62.t: "Pressuring The Regent to Emancipate his Serfs"
tib.62.d: "Serfdom is common throughout Tibet. For a long time no one had an alternative. However, recently a proposal has come before the Tibetan Regent, [TIB.GetLeader], to liberate the serfs that work directly in the various Ganden Phodrang’s Estates. Supporters of the Young Tibet Party believe that this proposal can bring about a gradual end to serfdom in Tibet. However their opponents decry the proposal as being just more foreign interference in Tibet."
tib.62.a: "Leading by example"
tib.62.b: "We will not abandon our traditions!"

tib.63.t: "Pressure the Tse Laptra to Expand Education"
tib.63.d: "Education in Tibet is currently done by two agencies, the Tse Laptra and the Tsikhang. The Tse Laptra trains male boys in monastic and governmental duties while the Tsikhang trains the sons of the aristocracy for their role in the government. While this system has served Tibet for centuries, there is rampant poverty throughout the country. To that end a proposal to begin transforming the education system to a modern system for a modern Tibet. The first step being to open the Tse Laptra to allow lay people to enter the Tse Laptra. However others decry this as being foreign influence to destroy the traditional Tibetan ways of life. "

However, as most of the Dob-dobs were traditionalists this only increased tension among the ranks. It got so bad that at one point when the Frontier Corps went to the nearby Shigatse town they were nearly mobbed by the villagers and Dob-dobs.

During these memorial services, vows against the Ma Clique are often spoken aloud. The government in Lhasa which took them in following their brutal massacre has announced plans to build a memorial in honour of those that were killed. Such a move has not gone unnoticed by the Goloks or the Mas."
tib.113.a: "We shall never forget the day when the Mas attacked."

tib.114.t: "Austrian Explorers in Tibet"
tib.114.d: "The two Austrian Explorers Peter Aufschnaiter and Heinrich Harrer have arrived in the capital of Lhasa. They seem to have a surprising grasp on our language. Normally we would help transport them to the edge of our country to prevent them from. However, a small minority have suggested that we could use them to learn more about the rest of the world. "
tib.114.a: "We do not need Foreign Influence"
tib.114.b: "We shall learn from them"

tib.115.t: "Harrer's Influence"
tib.115.d: "Since Heinrich Harrer has decided to stay in Tibet we have made him a government employee, specifically the court photographer, this way so we can keep a better eye upon the foreigner. He has even introduced the foreign idea of icec-skating to our country. The more hardliner traditionalists are outraged at this but with Harrer’s friendship to the Dalai Lama, they can only work to sideline him in Tibet and hope he decides to move on. "
tib.115.a: "We should have exiled them."

tib.116.t: "Harrer decides to leave Tibet"
tib.116.d: "After his time within Tibet, Heinreich Harrer has decided to leave Tibet. Likely he intends to return to Austria. Most do not really care where he goes next. Still he has left an impact on Tibet, mostly in the friendship with the Dalai Lama. Let us hope that this does not bring ruin to Tibet in the future. Still many are glad that he has finally decided to move on. "
tib.116.a: "They are finally moving on"

tib.117.t: "French Explorer in Lhasa"
tib.117.d: "We have uncovered a french explorer by the name of Alexandra David-Néel in Lhasa. During her time in the capital, she has been masquerading as a buddhist nun. Apparently she came in with other pilgrims during the Monlam Prayer Festival. It has been decided that she will be escorted to the border with Nepal and she can find her own way back to France."
tib.117.a: "Good Riddance"

tib.118.t: "Dealing with Rebellious Shigatse Nobles"
tib.118.d: "Some nobles in Shigatse have supported the Panchen Lama and his rebels against Tibet. They wanted to bring foreign ideas that would destroy Tibet, such as radical ideas from the Kuomintang. For this the Regent, [TIB.GetLeader] has decided to punish them for their rebellion. They will be executed and have their lands confiscated.  "
tib.118.a: "This shall teach the rebels."

tib.119.t: "Dealing with Rebellious Kham Nobles"
tib.119.d: "Some nobles in Kham have supported the Panchen Lama and his rebels against Tibet. They wanted to bring foreign ideas that would destroy Tibet, such as radical ideas from the Kuomintang. For this the Regent, [TIB.GetLeader] has decided to punish them for their rebellion. They will be executed and have their lands confiscated.  "
tib.119.a: "This shall teach the rebels."

tib.120.t: "Questioning the Dalai Lama"
tib.120.d: "With the fair and democratic electionsi in Tibet riteously choosing [TIB.GetLeader], the democratic government can now evaluate the matter of the Dalai Lama free of his traditional influence. With the 14th Dalai Lama still far too young to represent the people of Tibet on his own, it falls to the Kashag to delineate his roles in this new revolutionary enviroment. [TIB.GetLeader], compelled by attractive revelations and supported by the Bharatiyan establishment, has begun to question the absolute legitimacy of the young child as the new Dalai Lama. According to Roerich, revelations occurring across Tibet and India point towards there being a 9th Dalai Lama living, not a 14th. These objections are drawing a lot of criticism from Kham and Amdo, but the Khampa people seem to support this assertion."
tib.120.a: "Should we conduct anouther search?"

tib.121.t: "Introducing Theosophy to Tibet"
tib.121.d: "The Sacred Union Party has finally convinced enough Lhasa residents to allow an official delegation of the Theosophical Society into Tibet. This office will inhabit Trimön's old residence in Lhasa, and has promised to be a positive factor in the country's stability. The delegates, arriving from India, have treated the occasion with the greatest gratitude. A shirne has appeared to the great philosophers Helena Blavatsky, Annie Besant and Jiddu Krishnamurti, representing the three descendants of the ancient peoples Theosophists believe came out of Tibet in ancient days."
tib.121.a: "Lenin would be so proud!"

tib.123.t: "KMT and Indian Socialists Overthrow Tibet"
tib.123.d: "To most newspapers, news from Tibet is treated as fanciful stories of little consequence to geopolitics, only relevant to fellow Buddhists scattered throughout China. However, the modern world has finally entered Tibet in the ideology of Sun Yat-Sen, toppling their Regent and installing the radical ideologue [TIB.GetLeader]. The new Regent is now guided by the Tibet Improvement Party, a collection of Khampa agitators trained by the KMT and grateful to Bharatiya for asylum. [TIB.GetLeader] has given statements to National Geographic, the only reporters currently allowed in Tibet, promising to fulfill his duties as Regent first, and locate the next Dalai Lama. More grandiose promises of free and democratic elections and repulsing the Ma Muslims from Yushu were also announced."

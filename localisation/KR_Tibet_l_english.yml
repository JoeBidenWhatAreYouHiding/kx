### Leaders ###
POLITICS_NICHOLAS_ROERICH_DESC:0 "Raised by the aristocratic Roerich family of St. Petersburg, Nicholas has expressed interest in both the aesthetic and spiritual side of socialist revolution. This interest led Nicholas first into the Arts, where he graduated from St. Petersburg University and the Imperial Academy of the Arts in 1897. Nicholas became immersed in Russian avant garde art, which included working with the legendary Igor Stravinsky and Vaslav Nijinsky. The October Revolution ended the social peace that Nicholas had known, and set Nicholas closer to social conservatism and orientalism in opposition to Vladimir Lenin.\nNicholas Roerich fled to the United States and joined the Theosophical Society, a spiritual movement that shared Roerich's admiration of undeveloped nations as 'more spiritually pure' than westernized counterparts. Roerich visited the Theosophical Society in both the Bharatiya Commune and British Dominion in 1930, and had a startling conversation with Gandhi. Gandhi expressed to Roerich that Vladimir Lenin was not against traditional culture, but against corrupt leaders of traditional institutions.\nNicholas Roerich decided to take his family to visit Tibet through the Shimla mountains, and received a second calling in the mountains. A sherpa guiding Roerich remarked 'Is it true, that Lenin was not against Buddhism?' This led to a religious experience in Nicholas, which ended the expedition when he spoke of this in Lhasa. Nicholas began describing Vladimir Lenin as 'Mahatma Lenin' and was forced to leave Tibet by the Ganden Phodrang for this heretical idea. Back in Bharatiya, Nicholas was alerted to a possible revolution in Tibet emanating from Sikkim. In Sikkim, Nicholas Roerich combined his revelations with an endorsement from Gandhi to form the Sacred Union Party, a revolutionary party dedicated to saving Tibetan Buddhism through Esoteric Leninism."
POLITICS_9TH_PACHEN_LAMA_DESC:0 "The 9th Panchen Lama was born Choekyi Nyima into the Thuben class in Shigatse, Tibet. Raised and educated by the prestigious Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, the young Choekyi Nyima was predestined to be the 'Great Scholar' under the Dalai Lama, and was for a time well respected by the Ganden Phodrang. As a young scholar, the 9th Panchen Lama met with radical lama Agvan Dorzhiev, who taught him the Prayer to Shambhala. This prayer was intended to collect the allies of Buddhism together to the center of the world, the fictional city of Shambhala. Political realities came in 1924 when the 13th Dalai Lama was modernizing his army. The Dalai Lama demanded more taxation from the Panchen Lama as part of his feudal duties. When the Panchen Lama refused, The Dalai Lama cut off the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and confiscated the Panchen Lama's property. The resulting conflict forced the Panchen Lama to flee Tibet to Mongolia in 1924.\nThe Panchen Lama, seeing Mongolia as unable to aid in his return under Baron Ungern, left for Bharatiya in 1931. In Bharatiya, the Panchen Lama connected with the other exiled Tibetan nobles Pandatsang Rapga and Thubten Kunphela. These two exiles had connection in Kham, and had aligned themselves with exiled KMT generals to form the Tibet Improvement Party. The Panchen Lama, seeing no other way to return to Tibet save for an invasion, joined the Tibet Improvement Party and began publishing commentaries of Sun Yat Sen's Three Principles of the People. The storm of the revolution saw the Panchen Lama promise to preserve the existence of the Ganden Phodrang while removing their ability to choose the Kashag."
POLITICS_TSIPON_LUNGSHAR_DESC:0 "Tsipön Lungshar comes from a family that has served the Dalai Lama since the 18th century, and has deep connections to Lhasa. Lungshar was chosen to supervise the elite education of four nobles called the 'Rugby Four' in the UK prior to the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Lungshar stood in between the more radical nobles like Thuben Kunphela and Trimön in the early years of the Regency. It was Lungshar who accused Thuben Kunphela of orchestrating a foreign infiltration of Tibet in 1933, leading to his exile. However, Lungshar also opposed the power of the Regency, especially their strongman Trimön. Trimön orchestrated a trial where Lungshar was accused of being a socialist, then blinded before being exiled to Sikkim. The revolution saved Lungshar's life, and enabled him to return to Tibet and found the Kyicho Kuntun, a moderate political party that wishes to balance the needs of democracy with the traditions of Tibet."
POLITICS_TSARONG_DZASA_DESC:0 "When the 13th Dalai Lama decided to modernize the army in 1923, he put nobleman Tsarong Dzasa in charge of the newly created Dmag-Sgar. Tsarong previously had a very successful career leading the Dob Dobs in defending Tibet from the Qing during the Xinhai revolution. Defeating the Qing earned Tsarong the name 'Hero of Chaksam', and he used his popularity to increase the national budget for Tibet's army. This indirectly caused the expulsion of the Panchen Lama in 1924. The death of the 13th Dalai Lama left the country in the control of the Regency, led by the 5th Reting Rinpoche and Trimön. Tsarong was demoted from Commander-In-Chief to Civil Engineer and Treasurer, but this failed to stop his popularity. Trimön was initially happy when Tsarong left for Utsang, along with his Young Tibet movement, but now Trimön sits in the Potala prison while Tsarong has effectively assumed his position. The 5th Reting Rinpoche now only serves as Regent unable to leave the Ganden Phodrang until the 14th Dalai Lama is revealed."
POLITICS_JAMPHEL_YESHE_GYALTSEN_DESC:0 "Thubten Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen, nobleman, friend to the 13th Dalai Lama, and Regent of Tibet. The 5th Reting Rinpoche presided over a tumultuous period in Tibetan history, one that saw numerous exiles, tortures, and heavy reliance on the Commander-In-Chief Trimön to stay in power. The Reting Rinpoche stood behind Trimön's continuation of the tax increases, and stands as the most legitimate leader of Tibet until the 14th Dalai Lama is found. The Reting Rinpoche continues to hold the Ganden Phodrang steady, confident that his friend the Dalai Lama would be ruined by submission to foreign tutelage, whether from the British Indians, the Chinese, or the Hui Muslims."
POLITICS_DALAI_LAMA_DESC:0 "The child named Lhamo Thondup grew up in the small village ot Taktser in Amdo, a highly contentious region. The child was the youngest of seven, including his brother, Thubten Jigme Norbu, who had been recognized as the Takster Rinpoche in 1925. The young Dalai Lama was chosen after the Regent's vision that the new Dalai Lama was born in Amdo. The young Dalai Lama was taken to Lhasa where he will be instructed in the coming years in all aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, and slowly given influence from the regency. "
POLITICS_CHANGRA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1878\n§YPolitical Career:§L\nBorn with the personal name Wangchuk Tharchin, Changra entered government serivce in 1902, eventually serving directly under the Dalai Lama. Changra was given the De-psn rank, and commanded the private bodygaurds of the 13th Dalai Lama. Following the Dalai Lama's passing, Changra was considered for the Commander-in-Chief position of the Tibetan Army, but was passed for the more zealous Trimön. Changra is said to be a sternly political in person, but wields no political influence."
POLITICS_TRIMON_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1874\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nTrimön was born Norbu to a 6th ranked official in Tibet, and took the name Trimön upon his marriage. In 1912, Trimön was assigned as Assistant Commander-In-Chief of the Tibetan Army during the Chinese border crisis. Trimon was one of the few Tibetan diplomats present at the 1914 Simla Convention, and met Lord Hardinge. Trimön returned to Tibet to become the Commissioner of Eastern Tibet, where he irritated the Kashag with his staunch isolationist stance. In the final year of the 13th Dalai Lama, Trimön happened upon the machinations of Lungshar, and personally persuaded the aging Dalai Lama to order Lungshar blinded for his liberal schemes. Trimön used this political affair to become a close confident with the regent, the young Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen. Trimön influenced the young Regent towards his isolationist view of both China and India, and the new Reting Rinpoche reciprocated by appointing Trimön Commander-In-Chief of the Tibetan Army. Recently Trimön has grown noticeably paranoid in his old age."
POLITICS_TAISHI_DONDRUBN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1904\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nTashi Döndrub entered the Tibetan army at a young age in 1924, and used his aristocratic background to attend artillery training in the British Raj. Upon his return in 1930, Taishi was given a prestigious position of Secretary of the Kashag. In 1932 Taishi received additional training commanding machine gun operators, again in the British Raj. Taishi's extensive training allowed him a spot in the bodyguard of the 13th Dalai Lama. In 1933 Taishi was made general of a second experimental Dmag-Sgar division, the second after Thuben Kunphela's. Taishi's talent for new technology was recognized by the Reting Rinpoche in 1935, who made him Minister of Salt and Tea tax."
POLITICS_DINGJA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1896\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn with the personal name Dorji Gyaltsen, Dingja was one of the potential candidates of the celebrated 'Rugby Four' to be sent for overseas education. After not being selected, Dingja became Postmaster-General of Tibet in 1917. Dingja attached himself to the rising star Tsarong by marrying his sister. This status made him able to arrange for advanced gunnery training in the British Raj, as well as lessons in English and Hindu. Dingja was appointed General in 1923, and was demoted in 1925 due to his liberal viewpoints. Following the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Dingja attempted to organize the purchase of weapons from the British Raj, but was denied by the new Commander-In-Chief, Trimön. To ensure that Dingja did not upset Lhasa further, Trimön assigned Dingja in 1935 to lead the Dob-Dobs of Shigatse, ostensibly to protect them from a possible return of the Panchen Lama."
TIB_HUANG_MUSONG_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1884\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA student of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and instructor at Whampoa Primary School, Huang Musong's career seemed to veer just out of relevance to national politics. During the Xinhai Revolution, Huang was appointed to the National Defense Inspection Commission and went to Mongolia and Xinjiang. Afterwards Huang attempted to enter Beiyang politics by becoming the Director of the Route Review Committee of the Ministry of Transport, but was ultimately reassigned back to Xinjiang in 1927, and his inactivity Northern Expedition only diminished Huang's reputation. Huang spent several more years in service of the underground KMT in Xinjiang, where he made contact with Sheng Shicai and Jin Shuren. Huang's reports to the Left KMT stating that both administrators were suitable patriots remains unchallenged within the Party. Huang visited Tibet after the 13th Dalai Lama's death in 1934, and found that most of the potential allies of the KMT were expelled to Bharatiya. After some time in Sikkim, Huang returned to the KMT's headquarters in preparation of the next revolution, and was appointed a chairman of the defunct Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. "

TIB_struggle_tibet_desc:0 "At the moment, Tibet’s government is stuggling with exiled revolutionaries and reformers competing for control of the country.

TIB_struggle_tibet2:0 "Aristocracy Unsettled"
TIB_struggle_tibet2_desc:0 "The religious and civil offices of Tibet, from the Yigtsang to Kashag, are currently struggling to deal with the imprisonment of the 5th Reting Rinpoche. Many civil servants are goind without pay, and several Thubtens are refusing to pay their feudal dues to Lhasa. Without this money the Ganden Phodrang struggles to enact any meaningful reforms."

TIB_struggle_tibet3:0 "Aristocracy Resettled"
TIB_struggle_tibet3_desc:0 "Through politcal capital, The Young Tibet Party has sucessfully gained the trust of the Thubtens and civil servants of Tibet.

TIB_monastic_governance_desc:0 "Much of the Tibetan countryside is comprised of monastic fiefs.

#Events

tib.1.t:0 "The Regency and The Tibetan People"
tib.1.d:0 "In 1936, Tibet is embroiled in a bitter leadership dispute. The 13th Dalai Lama died in 1933, leaving 5th Reting Rinpoche, Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen, as his regent until a new Dalai Lama can be found. As the leadership struggle unfolded, the Reting Rinpoche was instated as the Regent, however he serves as only a figurehead of the chaotic government. Four main factions unfolded in the conflict, Lungshar’s Kyicho Kuntun, The Panchen Lama's Tibet Improvement Party, Tsarong’s Young Tibet, and the Traditionalists, led by Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen and Trimön. The rest of the central government of Tibet, referred to as the Ganden Phodrang, is occupied by a collection of appointed officers both theocratic and civil. The Rinpoche are high ranking Buddhist monks that are confirmed by the public to be reincarnations of previous important monks. The Kashag is a four-way council traditionally appointed by civil servants, but after 1933 has been controlled by Marshal Trimön. The Thubten are feudal landowners that hold significant sway in the more prosperous eastern half of Tibet in Khampa. The people of Utsang, while still loyal to the Ganden Phodrang, are suffering from neglect and bandits coming out of Xinjiang and Kashmir."
tib.1.a:0 "We will persevere"

tib.2.t:0 "Restoration of the Dalai Lama"
tib.2.d:0 "The Regent has announced today that the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has been restored to his rightful place as Head of State of Tibet. Although his power is mostly ceremonial and concentrated with other government members, he is finally here. The search has ended."
tib.2.a:0 "May he live ten thousand years!"

tib.10.t:0 "The Regents Vision"
tib.10.d:0 "Sitting on the shore of the lake Lhamo La-tso lake, the Regent has had a vision of the new Dalai Lama. Through a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it, the vision took the Regent to a hill to the east. Opposite to the hill stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The eaves of this house were distinctive of houses in Amdo. The vision ends, and the Regent awakens to alert the lamas of their journey."
tib.10.a:0 "A Journey to Amdo!"

tib.11.t:0 "Preparing for the Journey"
tib.11.d:0 "Despite the intense political disruption of the past few months, the Taktra Rinpoche has remained loyal to the government, although the Kwetsng Rinpoche has sequestered himself in Kham,after refusing to join the Reting Rinpoche's government in 1932. Once the Kwetsang Rinpoche is added to their team, they must enter the Ma's territory in Amdo to retrieve the Dalai Lama. The feuding Ma family will surely not notice an expedition if it is done quickly, however waiting may bring harm to the next Dalai Lama, just as neutrality before Trimön caused the deaths of thousands of Golok Tibetans in 1921."
tib.11.a:0 "Now for the escort"

tib.12.t:0 "The Company of the Lamas"
tib.12.d:0 "It appears that the Ma family feud is still confined primairly to Qinghai and Ningxia, meaning most of their forces will be preoccupied. Our commander in chief recommends a detachment of elite Dmag-Sgar regulars, which would ensure no Ma patrol could harm the expedition. The Regent, however, does not recall any military encampment in his vision, and insists that a small escort will suffice. A small collection of Lamas in the Ganden Phodrang, all from Amdo, have professed that no escort will be safer than any escort, as they have been able to visit Amdo in recent years in disguises. The choice ultimately falls to the Regent."
tib.12.a:0 "Faster with no escort"
tib.12.b:0 "Bring a small escort"
tib.12.c:0 "No less than two thousand guards"

tib.13.t:0 "Meeting the Kwetsang Rinpoche"
tib.13.d:0 "The expedition has reached Gyêgu Monastary, outside of Yushu. The Kwetsang Rinpoche has been coordinating an effort there to protect Tibetans from the Ma family. The Kwetsang Rinpoche has reported that he has narrowed down the candidates for the Dalai Lama to three children, and is struggling currently to ensure the Tibetans of Amdo continue to follow their buddhist traditions, lest another fish incident occur, when in 1924 the Lamas of Amdo abandoned their vegetarian diet while meeting westerners, and nearly caused the 13th Dalai Lama to die of imprudence. The Kwetsang Rinpoche would be invaluable in ensuring that each child be tested accurately, at the same time the thought of the new Dalai Lama dying because his fellow Tibetans did not adhere to their monastic vows is freightening."
tib.13.a:0 "Wish him well"
tib.13.b:0 "Send him home"

tib.14.t:0 "Meeting A Poor Farmer"
tib.14.d:0 "Whilst enroute to the foretold destination in Yushu, the Lamas’ happened upon the ruins of a desolate village, the smoldering piles of burnt wood and dirt craters turned up little evidence as to what had happened here. It was not until a day later, whereupon the company encountered a refugee caravan, that the truth revealed itself. Recent raids from the Ma Clique has annihilated large parts of the Yushu countryside, forcing the peasants to flee north-west, where they are being huddled into militarily occupied villages. While some refugees have hope of moving past the military checkpoints, others have more vengeful ambitions. One of the poor, destitute farmers that the Lamas’ caravans passed struck up a conversation with the monastic lords, whilst eyeing their collection of guns, food and ammunition. It did not take long for this refugee to steer the conversation in the direction of what Lhasa can do to aid the downtrodden in Yushu. Perhaps, smuggling weapons and supplies to the northbound refugees will put the Ma Clique in for a surprise... On the other hand, it may very well compel the Ma Warlords to treat the refugees even more harshly, if they have reason to suspect them to be partisans."
tib.14.a:0 "Help Him"
tib.14.b:0 "Move Along"

tib.15.t:0 "Ma Forces Encounter Escort"
tib.15.d:0 "Not long after passing the refugee caravan, the Lamas laid eyes upon one of the very villages they had been warned of. Squalid hamlets, stitched together tents and all around air of misery surrounded the tiny settlement, which was brimming with guards proudly flying the Ma Clique’s red and white flag. To many of the locals which had been relocated here, even the war-torn province of Gansu may be preferable to this. The mention of Gansu filled the Kwetsan Rinpoche with a sudden realisation. A smaller stream of refugees had been moving west, in an attempt to settle near Liulin village and avoid the northern checkpoints. By following this alternative route, then veering north into the wilderness for a few days, the Lamas’ caravan could likely avoid the military checkpoints. As the guards near the occupied village began to eye the caravan suspiciously, the Kwetsan Rinpoche guided his comrades west, soon ordering them into a full blown march to maintain one step ahead of the Ma Clique patrol’s pursuit!"
tib.15.a:0 "Run!"

tib.16.t:0 "Visiting Kumbum Monastery"
tib.16.d:0 "Although it has severely tired his men, and the enemy soldiers have mercilessly hounded them west, the journey to Amdo draws ever closer to its destination. After a couple of days along the trail to Liulin, the Ma Patrols’ eventually gave up the chase, unleashing their greed and wrath upon some other caravan of helpless innocents. A few more days north through the wilderness, and the Lamas’ caravans finally reached Kumbum Monastery, earning them a long rest in the company of friends and allies. The Monastery, which is ranked second only to Lhasa in terms of spiritual importance, has remained untouched by the Ma Clique’s forces. The great temple of Je Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school, is simply too sacred of a shrine even for nonbelievers and warlords to pillage, even though they have attempted to sow divides between the Gelug school and the Nyingma school by meddling in Kumbum’s affairs. Despite this, the Monastery welcomed the Caravan with open arms and helped guide them in the direction of Taktster, showing that there was still some brotherly love between the schools."
tib.16.a:0 "We're getting closer"

tib.17.t:0 "Reaching the Village of Taktser"
tib.17.d:0 "The Caravan entered the village of Taktser with a heavy heart. Out of the three names of children in Yushu the Kwetsang Rinpoche gave to the Regent, the first two were not him. The first child, in another village, was already deathly ill when the Caravan encountered him. The second child who was shown the items of the 13th Dalai Lama ran away, hopefully to his parents. This village was home to the Thubten Jigme Norbu, a young child who had been chosen for nobility in 1921. Hopefully here we will find the Dalai Lama."
tib.17.a:0 "A non-tibetan village? Interesting"

tib.18.t:0 "Testing the Boy of Taktser"
tib.18.d:0 "A child was brought out to view the items of the 13th Dalai Lama who had demonstrated knowledge of Lhasan Tibetan. This child was repeatedly allowed to pick out an item from a set display, and every time he choose a former memento of the 13th Dalai Lama. In the few days the Regent has been in Taktster, the child has demonstrated incredible calmness to the strife broiling to the north. This child could be the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama."
tib.18.a:0 "The boy that lived...."

tib.19.t:0 "This is the Dalai Lama!"
tib.19.d:0 "With time running short, the Regent has consulted his thoughts. Truely the weight of the brewing conflict between the Ma Clique would leave so many more children destitute, even destroy towns like Takster. The child would certainly not survive the war. Ultimately the weight of all of Buddhism is impressed into the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. The child is the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and is thus the most precious symbol of Tibetan hope in this world."
tib.19.a:0 "Now Make haste to Lhasa"

tib.20.t:0 "The Qinghai Army Approaches Taktser"
tib.20.d:0 "Before the Caravan could depart from Takster, a guide reported that the Qinghai army is nearby. Every measure must be taken to keep the Dalai Lama out of the hands of the Ma Clique, for they have no kindness for Buddhists, and we can only counter their aggression with our own. The Regent has taken the Dalai Lama to hide at a nearby farmhouse, hopefully the Qinghai soldiers will stray elswhere."
tib.20.a:0 "Hide the boy"
tib.20.b:0 "Hide the boy, the escort will distract them"

tib.21.t:0 "The Dalai Lama Hides"
tib.21.d:0 "Hiding in a nearby farm, the caravan containing the new Dalai Lama hides. Although the Qinghai Army spent several days in Taktser, the loyalty of the residents to our cause meant that the army could do nothing but search. After two days, the Qinghai Army passed out of Takster, and the caravan could start on their return journey in earnest."
tib.21.a:0 "The coast is clear"

tib.22.t:0 "The Dalai Lama Reaches Lhasa"
tib.22.d:0 "After a month of travel, the caravan containing the Regent and Dalai Lama have returned safely to Lhasa. Upon their return, the Regent gave a speech to the Lamas outlining the incredible danger posed to Buddhists in Amdo, including the very real threat posed by the Qinghai army. The Lamas, once sanguine in their positions, have begun agitating the Kashag towards war with the Ma Clique once again, fearful that another massacre like the one comitted against the Golok people was imminent."
tib.22.a:0 "Safe at last"

tib.23.t:0 "Preparing the Procession of Lamas"
tib.23.d:0 "The 13th Dalai Lama suffered from both the shakles of imperialism and the apathy of the Buddhist world, which was exacerbated by hisd time in exile. In order to ensure that this Dalai Lama is protected and exalted by Buddhists all across asia, a larger ceremony is necessary, one with western observers. Firstly our friends in the Gelug School must be gathered from their far flung reaches, from Mongolia, Tuva and Kalmykia. These Lamas will be the first to exalt the Dalai Lama before he is given the larger audience. The danger of invasion also means that, should Tibet fall, our Gelug allies can best coordinate a plan to save the Dalai Lama. "
tib.23.a:0 "Invite the Mongols, Tuvans and Kalmyk"

tib.27.t:0 "Direction of Tibet Military Reform"
tib.27.d:0 "We need to decide the direction of our Army. Two paths lay for the Tibetan Army. The first direction is to focus on the Dob-dobs and make it more rigid and make it more meritocratic. Another direction is to focus on a more modern and regular Army. This will require purging the Dob-dobs and reducing their influence in government. What path shall be chosen?"
tib.27.a:0 "The Dob-dobs can be reformed"
tib.27.b:0 "A regular army is needed"

tib.28.t:0 "Dmag-Sgar Empowered to Regulars"
tib.28.d:0 "Decades after the first Dmag-Sgar regiment was organized under the 13th Dalai Lama, the Army of Tibet is finally fuly modernized. Like most reforms in Tibet, this change comes from the top-down, starting with our finance minister and continuing to our officers first. Hopefully larger divisions will enable us to defend better against the modernized armies to the east."
tib.28.a:0 "Finally"

tib.29.t:0 "Young Tibet Party Leaves Lhasa"
tib.29.d:0 "After being demoted, General Tsarong Dzasa has been a thorn in [TIB.GetLeader]'s side. Tsarong Dzasa has been agitating in Lhasa to escalate our diplomatic relations with the British in Delhi, even as their power has waned following their syndicalist revolution. Thankfully Tsarong Dzasa and his Young Tibet party didn't support the blind Lungshar, who made his revolutionary intentions known in Kham, deserving of his blindness."
tib.29.a:0 "We may need to blind Dzasa as well."

tib.30.t:0 "Tibet Improvement Party Spotted in Shigatse"
tib.30.d:0 "Rumors circulating among the Dob-dobs that visit the Ganden Phodrang allege that the Nepalese border has seen an increase in tax resistance. This can only mean one thing, that the 9th Panchen Lama is plotting against the Regency again. The Panchen Lama was exiled a decade ago for resisting the 13th Dalai Lama's tax collection, and his domain in Shigatse was rightfully seized by the Ganden Phodrang to pay back taxes.

Some members believe that the 'Aryans' were a race that descended from the heavens to settle Atlantis before it was flooded. They also claim the descendants Aryans are now the Nordic (German) race and hope to prove an ancestral link."
tib.130.a:0 "Glad to see the back of these lunatics"

tib.131.t:0 "The Ahnenerbe Expedition to Tibet."
tib.131.d:0 "Today the Forschungs-und Lehrgemeinschaft das Ahnenerbe e.V. sponsored expedition under the leadership of Dr. Ernst Schafer arrived in Tibet. They say that they are interested in the nomads of the central plateaus and in learning what ancient and mystical wisdom they can from us. "

tib.113.t:0 "Memorial for the Golok Massacre"
tib.113.d:0 "Every year since 1932 the Golok People have burned incense for those that were massacred by the Ma Clique during their war against Tibet. During these memorial services, vows against the Ma Clique are often spoken aloud. The government in Lhasa which took them in following their brutal massacre has announced plans to build a memorial in honour of those that were killed. Such a move has not gone unnoticed by the Goloks or the Mas."
tib.113.a:0 "We shall never forget the day when the Mas attacked."

tib.114.t:0 "Austrian Explorers in Tibet"
tib.114.d:0 "The two Austrian Explorers Peter Aufschnaiter and Heinrich Harrer have arrived in the capital of Lhasa. They seem to have a surprising grasp on our language. Normally we would help transport them to the edge of our country to prevent them from. However, a small minority have suggested that we could use them to learn more about the rest of the world. "
tib.114.a:0 "We do not need Foreign Influence"
tib.114.b:0 "We shall learn from them"

tib.115.t:0 "Harrer's Influence"
tib.115.d:0 "Since Heinrich Harrer has decided to stay in Tibet we have made him a government employee, specifically the court photographer, this way so we can keep a better eye upon the foreigner. He has even introduced the foreign idea of icec-skating to our country. The more hardliner traditionalists are outraged at this but with Harrer’s friendship to the Dalai Lama, they can only work to sideline him in Tibet and hope he decides to move on. "
tib.115.a:0 "We should have exiled them."

tib.116.t:0 "Harrer decides to leave Tibet"
tib.116.d:0 "After his time within Tibet, Heinreich Harrer has decided to leave Tibet. Likely he intends to return to Austria. Most do not really care where he goes next. Still he has left an impact on Tibet, mostly in the friendship with the Dalai Lama. Let us hope that this does not bring ruin to Tibet in the future. Still many are glad that he has finally decided to move on. "
tib.116.a:0 "They are finally moving on"

tib.117.t:0 "French Explorer in Lhasa"
tib.117.d:0 "We have uncovered a french explorer by the name of Alexandra David-Néel in Lhasa. During her time in the capital, she has been masquerading as a buddhist nun.

tib.118.t:0 "Dealing with Rebellious Shigatse Nobles"
tib.118.d:0 "Some nobles in Shigatse have supported the Panchen Lama and his rebels against Tibet.

tib.119.a:0 "This shall teach the rebels."

tib.120.t:0 "Questioning the Dalai Lama"
tib.120.d:0 "With the fair and democratic electionsi in Tibet riteously choosing [TIB.GetLeader], the democratic government can now evaluate the matter of the Dalai Lama free of his traditional influence. With the 14th Dalai Lama still far too young to represent the people of Tibet on his own, it falls to the Kashag to delineate his roles in this new revolutionary enviroment. [TIB.GetLeader], compelled by attractive revelations and supported by the Bharatiyan establishment, has begun to question the absolute legitimacy of the young child as the new Dalai Lama. According to Roerich, revelations occurring across Tibet and India point towards there being a 9th Dalai Lama living, not a 14th. These objections are drawing a lot of criticism from Kham and Amdo, but the Khampa people seem to support this assertion."
tib.120.a:0 "Should we conduct anouther search?"

tib.121.t:0 "Introducing Theosophy to Tibet"

This office will inhabit Trimön's old residence in Lhasa, and has promised to be a positive factor in the country's stability. The delegates, arriving from India, have treated the occasion with the greatest gratitude. A shirne has appeared to the great philosophers Helena Blavatsky, Annie Besant and Jiddu Krishnamurti, representing the three descendants of the ancient peoples Theosophists believe came out of Tibet in ancient days."
tib.121.a:0 "Lenin would be so proud!"

tib.123.d:0 "To most newspapers, news from Tibet is treated as fanciful stories of little consequence to geopolitics, only relevant to fellow Buddhists scattered throughout China. However, the modern world has finally entered Tibet in the ideology of Sun Yat-Sen, toppling their Regent and installing the radical ideologue [TIB.GetLeader].

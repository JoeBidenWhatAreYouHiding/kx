### Events ###
WRA.1.t: "Legacy of the Northern Corps"
WRA.1.d: "In the fall of 1918, with the assistance of the German Army, the Northern Corps, or Northern Army, a volunteer force of monarchist-minded officers, emerged. The Corps began to be created within the framework of the German project to create on the territories of the former Russian Empire, which fell under German occupation as a result of the Great War and the Brest Peace, two pro-German and monarchist-minded armies of Russian volunteers - the \"Southern\" in the territories of Ukraine and the All-Great Army of the Don and the \"Northern\" - in the north-west of Russia, which fell into the zone of German occupation, as a result of the February offensive of the Germans in 1918.\n\nIt was supposed that the Northern Army \"upon completion of formation should be sworn to the lawful Tsar and the Russian state\". At the head of the Northern Army stood the little-known General Vandam, but the Pskov monarchists themselves wanted to see Keller at the head of their army, as \"one of the most serious generals of the Russian army\". Already soon it was Fyodor Keller, \"the first draughtsman of Russia\", who headed the army.\n\nWhat would later be called in the anti-German propaganda of the Kerensky era the \"German intervention in Russia\" was the successful attack on Petrograd in 1919. In the summer, the corps was officially renamed the North-Western Army and participated in the siege of Petrograd. It was the North-Western Army that was able to break the resistance of the Bolsheviks after several months of heavy fighting and together with other White units took Petrograd. Under agreements between the Germans and the government of the Supreme Ruler Kolchak, the North-Western Army became part of the Russian Army and was later demobilized.\n\nAs a proud successor to the North-Western Army, the Western Russian Army has been proclaimed with the German backing by general Pavel Bermondt-Avalov."

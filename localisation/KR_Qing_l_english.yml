POLITICS_PUYI_PUPPET_DESC:0 "'His Imperial Majesty, the Son of Heaven, the Xuantong Emperor’ - while Pu Yi holds many titles, the young Emperor has little power, and has never really possessed any ever since his birth in 1906. Deposed in the Xinhai revolution at the age of 5, he was returned to the throne as a condition of the German intervention in China, a move detested by the general population. With day-to-day governance largely handled by the civil government in Beijing, he has spent the last decade idly sitting in the Forbidden City, occupying his days with tennis matches and calligraphy. But the Xuantong Emperor may secretly harbor ambitions to restore China and his dynasty to the greatness they enjoyed centuries ago..."
POLITICS_PUYI_RESTORED_DESC:0 "Restored following what has now been deemed the Manchu Coup, Aisin-Gioro Puyi now sits at the helm of a government scrubbed clear of warlord influences. While some observers fear a return to traditionalism, the new Qing government seems to push for a much more modern style of rule. Puyi himself still lacks much power, but this is of his own design. Fearing a tyrannical descendant of the same type that doomed his predecessors, the Emperor and legal scholars have drafted a constitutional structure of monarchy where Puyi exercises spiritual and patriotic power while only having an advisory role in legislature and day-to-day governing. While this new structure of government is untested, it seems strong, and many in China and around the world are hoping Puyi can lead the nation into this brave new world."
POLITICS_PUYI_RESTORED__YIGUANDAO_DESC:0 "While many around China and the world hoped that the so-called Manchu Coup would restore some semblance of constitutional monarchy to China, the scheming machinations of Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran have buried any and all aspirations for modern imperial rule. With religious devotees rapidly filling all governmental posts and seizing control of the military, Puyi has been pushed back into a position of irrelevance, now answering to the beck and call of a religious cult rather than a military clique. His role remains relatively unchanged from the days of Wu Peifu, only now with more obscure religious rituals and less military reviews. Puyi himself seems to not mind very much, having completely fallen under the sway of the teachings of Zhang and the Yiguandao."
POLITICS_WU_PEIFU_DESC:0 "Narrowly escaping death at the hands of Puyi, Pujie, and the other Manchu noblemen who plotted to overthrow the Zhili clique, Wu Peifu has now dropped any facade of Imperial rule over China. Naming himself ‘interim head of the nation’, he is now tasked with building a legitimate system of government for his nation. A military man for his entire life, Wu is not expected to remain in power for long, and transfer control of the country to a hand-picked successor."
POLITICS_HU_SHIH_DESC:0 "A political philosopher and intellectual, Hu Shih may seem like an odd choice for first president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’. Yet the political philosophy he developed, ‘pragmatism’, was deeply influential to Wu Peifu during the years immediately following the restoration of the Qing, and the two frequently met in Hu’s office at Peking University, discussing how both men, former republicans, could and should dedicate themselves to the imperial project as the ‘least bad’ option for China. But with the Manchu’s tyranny revealed, Wu has selected Hu to lead the new government, hoping that the philosopher’s writings and public persona can lend an air of legitimacy to a government seen by most as a sham and a front for the Zhili clique."
POLITICS_WELLINGTON_KOO_DESC:0 "V. K. Wellington Koo, or Gu Weijun as he is known in China, is one of the nation’s foremost diplomats and statesmen. Influential in the negotiations surrounding the end of the Weltkrieg, during the Imperial restoration he served as ambassador to the United States. Recalled due to escalating political tensions, Wu has now appointed him president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’, hoping his diplomatic skills can help in achieving international legitimacy and recognition."

QIE_WU_PEIFU_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 22nd, 1874\nPenglai, Shandong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in Shandong to a merchant family, Wu entered the Baoding military academy and quickly rose through the ranks of the new Beiyang army. Following the collapse of the Republic of China in 1916 he aligned himself with Feng Guozhang’s Zhili clique, and following Feng’s death in 1919 he rose to dominate the clique, leading it to victory over its main rival, the Fengtian clique, in 1928, despite being betrayed by his former ally Feng Yuxiang. During these turbulent years he was mentored by Cao Kun, former and future president of the Assembly, who taught him the intriguing and scheming skills he used to seize control over the government. Although opposed to the reimposition of the Manchu monarchy by Germany, Wu has quickly adapted the Zhili clique to China’s new governmental structure, sidelining the Manchu and ensuring that he and his allies dominated nearly every facet of government. A token opposition was allowed to exist, but Wu truly controls the government.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nWu reportedly owns the world's largest diamond, but has refused to allow anyone to verify this claim.\nWas once renowned for hanging a photograph of George Washington behind his desk, but due to the ongoing political turmoil in the United States he has replaced this with a photograph of Bismarck. 'A great political thinker, just like Washington', Wu said to a visiting journalist, ignoring any questions about his relationship with Germany."
QIE_JIANG_BAILI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nHaining, Zhejiang, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into a relatively prosperous family, Jiang entered the Qing civil service in his youth and attended Tsinghua University, graduating in 1901. He studied in Japan, returning in 1910 for a brief stint in governance before going abroad again, this time to Germany. He served in Yuan Shikai’s government before he declared himself emperor, a decision Jiang strongly opposed. Following the collapse of Yuan’s ‘Empire’, he began working with Wu Peifu, becoming a close confidant and assisting him in defeating the Fengtian clique in 1928. He has become a close ally of Wu, and has spent most of the early 1930’s attempting to prepare the country against the threat of Japanese invasion, something he sees as an inevitability.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nSkilled military theorist, and has written several works on defensive strategy, though several have criticised him of stealing ideas from his subordinates."
QIE_WANG_HUAIQING_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1875\nNingjin, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWhile Wang was born into an upper-middle class family of bureaucrats in 1875, his father’s alcoholism and gambling drove the family into poverty. Wang left his family and joined the military at a young age, helping suppress revolts in 1905 and becoming a confidante of Yuan Shikai. When Shikai’s restoration fell apart, Wang allied himself with the Zhili clique, becoming a close confidante of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. Though he nominally commands several divisions of troops under the Qing command structure, he essentially uses these armies as thuggish extortionists, demanding outrageous 'protection' fees from towns near his troops garrisons.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nKnown affectionately as the 'toilet general' by his troops. There are two theories for this unique monicker: The first is that he loves his own toilet so much he orders it to be carried with him on campign at all times, where it served as a makeshift standard. In one story of dubious veracity, he launched an attack on a mountain fortification sitting atop his toilet, stamped with the Chinese character for 'Wang'. His troops faltered once the toilet vanished in the chaos of battle, but Wang and his men lifted the toilet aloft, ralling his troops and (supposedly) inspiring them to climb up a sheer cliff and seize the bastion. Furthermore, he apparently even uses a toilet in lieu of an office chair at his desk. The second (and more plausible) explanation for the nickname is that his troops are unwashed and smell like toilets, as Wang believes peasant soldiers taken right from the fields are more honest and loyal."
QIE_ZAITAO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJune 23rd, 1887\nBeijing, Qing Empire \n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAisin-Gioro Zaitao, uncle of Puyi, was born into a life of privilege and wealth enjoyed by few in China. The younger brother of the Guangxu Emperor, he was acquainted with a baby Puyi while he was a teenager. Rising through the ranks of the Manchu nobility due to his family ties, he was promoted to Inspector General in 1909 before embarking on a tour of the world in 1910, and attended the funeral of King George V in 1911. Appointed head of the Imperial Guard upon his return, Zaitao served until 1912, when Puyi was overthrown. Briefly restored to the position in 1917, he was immediately removed once Zhang Xun’s restoration attempt failed. He finally returned to the post in 1927 with the German re-imposition of Puyi to the throne. One of the founding members of the Manchu Party, Zaitao is more open to reform than most older Manchu nobility, having travelled around the world extensively in his youth. An excellent horsemen, he has become interested in armored warfare in recent years due to its potential battlefield applications.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nIn his spare time he enjoys horse riding, martial arts, and Beijing-style opera."
QIE_PUJIE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 16th, 1907\nBeijing, Qing Empire \n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe brother of Aisin-Gioro Puyi, Pujie spent his childhood as a playmate to his brother, who was notorious for his temper tantrums and pampered nature. A well-known incident recounted how Puyi threw a tantrum when he saw that the inner lining of one of Pujie's coats was yellow, because yellow was traditionally a colour reserved only for the emperor. Following the Restoration in 1927, Pujie attended university in Berlin, where he was given the nickname 'Peter' by his classmates, as they found Pujie too difficult to pronounce. Despite growing up in the shadow of his brother, Pujie rarely envied the Emperor, who was confined to pointless ceremonial duties and lacked much of an education beyond court formalities. Pujie, on the other hand, was exposed to the latest Western science, education, and culture. Dismayed by the moral laxness he found in Germany that sprung up following the horrors of the Weltkrieg, he returned to China impressed by Western science and industry, but wary of the libertine culture flourishing in Berlin. Furthermore, he was dismayed at the level of German control over the country, and especially despised the Zhili clique, whom he viewed as essentially holding his brother hostage. Largely resigned to a ceremonial position within the military, he plots to one day help his brother return to the rightful position on the throne, with him serving as a ‘guiding hand’, of course.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe has not married, despite rampant suspicion that the Emperor is infertile."
QIE_CAI_CHENGXUN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1871\nTianjin, Zhili, Qing Empire \n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA graduate of the Tianjin Wubei Academy, Cai Chengxun has served in the military since 1900, including a brief stint as military governor of Gansu, where he aligned himself with the Zhili Clique. Since the fourth Zhifeng war he has mainly concerned himself with guarding the northern frontier against Fengtian incursions.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nOnce built a residence and a ancestral hall in Tianjin and engaged in real estate, industrial investment and charity during his dismissal."
QIE_LIU_MENGGENG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1881\nFuning, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA graduate of the Qing's Army Military Medical School, Liu grew close to many in the Zhili clique while serving in a variety of medical and health offices, culminating with him serving as dean of the Baoding Academy's Medical Academy. He has served as 'Minister of Health' in Beijing since 1931, and has proposed an ambitious and far-reaching military reform plan that encompasses a variety of medical reforms.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHas close family ties to many in the Zhili clique, being a cousin of Cao Kun.\nHe is also the intelligence minister of Cao Kun and Zhili Clique."
QIE_WANG_CHENGBIN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nAugust 21st, 1874\nFengtian, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into an ethnically Manchu family, Wang was one of Wu’s earliest allies, helping him suppress Zhang Xun’s abortive Manchu restoration in 1917. In 1923, he led the troops to surround the president Li Yuanhong at the Tianjin Railway Station. He took the presidential seal to helped Cao Kun become the president. In failing health, Chengbin has largely secluded himself from other Zhili generals, and many are concerned his death will expose deep divisions within the internal workings of the Clique and the Harmony Association.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe was the founder of Tianjing Clique, which belonged to the early branches of Zhili Clique with Wu Peifu's Luoyang Clique and Cao Kun's Baoding Clique."
QIE_GOBULO_RUNQI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJuly 8th, 1912\nBeijing, Republic of China\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into a Manchu noble family with long ties to the Aisin-Gioro clan, Gobulo Runqi was born just after the Qing were overthrown for the first time. Interested in engineering as a child, Runqi entered adolescence as the German intervention in China reached its zenith. One of his most distinctive childhood memories was attending the wedding of his sister Wanrong to the exiled Emperor in the Tianjin concession at the age of 10. After the German intervention placed his brother-in-law back on the throne, Runqi learned German from the horde of businessmen and military attaches that descended on Beijing in the economic boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s. This culminated in him attending the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin, where he picked up the German name ‘Ruprecht’. Returning to China in 1935 following a tour of Europe, Runqi developed a fascination with armoured warfare and mechanization, inspired Heinz Guderian, an instructor at the Akademie. He is somewhat more sympathetic to the Germans than other Manchu, but the decadence and moral laxness he observed in Berlin during the boom years of the late 1920s and early 30s prevented him from becoming a full Germanophile.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nIn Berlin he became obsessed wih American cinema, and he introduced the genre to his brother-in-law, the Emperor, also a fan of cinema in general.\nHas quite the media presence, and his dalliances with various Beijing opera singers have made him a favourite of tabloids."
QIE_ZHANG_QIHUANG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1887\nYongfu, Guangxi, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nZhang Qihuang started his military career in Repulican forces in the south of China, rising quickly through the ranks, culminating with him serving as governor of Guandong. Once Yuan Shikai declared himself Emperor, however, he resigned in disgust and went to Shanghai. His brother introduced him to Wu Peifu, and the two quickly became close allies. He served as a dedicated advisor to Wu, and eventually was promoted to several independent army commands.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nA master fortune-teller and astrologer, known as "Iron Mouth." Wu Peifu rarely does anything without the advice of Zhang first."
QIE_LU_XIANGTING_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1880\nHejian, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA graduate of both the Baoding Academy and the Japanese Army Sergeant School, Lu was originally a subordinate governor in Sun Chuanfang's League of Eight Provinces, but Lu’s open disdain for Sun's cooperation with Germany and his hatred of foreign concessions lead to his dismissal by Sun. He instead chose to work with Wu Peifu instead. He has worked closely with Jiang Baili in drafting plans to deal with a Japanese invasion, as the only thing he despises more than the Germans is Japanese domination over Manchuria.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nStill maintains contact with many former subordinates in the League. Information gained from them is passed onto Wu and the rest of the Northern Zhili, giving them an inside look into Sun's government."
QIE_XIAO_YAONAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1875\nHuanggang, Hubei, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into an impoverished family of the rural gentry, Xiao was forced to turn away from his dreams of becoming an imperial official due to a lack of funds. Instead, he was selected by Zhang Zhidong to join his new Hubei Military Academy. Xiao graduated in 1909, and used connections to Cao Kun’s family to stay adrift in the turmoil of the Xinhai revolution, then using them to become governor of Hubei. He consolidated his rule over the province, and helped organise the ‘Hubei Generals’, an informal group of textile manufacturers, the main industry of Hubei. He narrowly survived an assassination attempt in 1926 carried out by enemies of Cao Kun, and was drawn further and further into the Zhili sphere during and after the German intervention. He still maintains his hold over Hubei, modernising the province while still working with Beijing.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHis connections within the 'Hubei Generals' give him a large amount of clout within Beijing, as Hubei is one of the few provinces that are industrially profitable."
QIE_LI_BINGZHI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1887\nZhengding, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLi Bingzhi had a relatively normal military career for the period, attending and graduating from the Baoding academy in 1908.There became acquainted with several future Zhili clique members, and following the unrest in 1917 and 1918 he joined Wu Peifu’s circle as a chief of staff to Wu ally Zhang Fulai. Rising quickly through the ranks, Li is seen as a competent officer.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHas well-known monarchist leanings, which alienated him from many former 'Republican' Zhili generals."
QIE_XIQIA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 18th, 1883\nFengtian, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA distant cousin of Puyi, Aisin-Gioro Xiqia was educated in Japan and served the Fengtian clique before the Restoration in 1927. Deserting with his mainly Manchu Kirin Provincial Army, he joined the Qing empire. One of the few Manchu generals to command large numbers of soldiers directly, he has an uneasy relationship with Wu Peifu and the Zhili clique, and is largely loyal to the Manchu party. \n§YImportant Notes:§L\nOne of the more traditionalist members of the Manchu Party."
QIE_CAO_SHIJIE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nTianjin, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nNephew to Cao Kun, Cao Shijie grew up in one of the most prominent and well-connected families in China. These ties helped him gain entrance to the Baoding military academy, and was selected to lead an elite group of troops picked out by Yuan Shikai. Following the 1917 uprising, Cao Shijie joined the Zhili Clique, and served as president of his uncle’s Presidential Guard after he bribed his way to the presidency in 1923. The scandal surrounding the Beijing Coup of 1924 pushed Shijie out of power, but in recent years he has regained prominence among Zhili generals.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nLike his uncle, he turned to heavy drinking following the shame associated with the Beijing Coup."
QIE_ZHANG_SHAOZENG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 9th, 1879\nDacheng, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nZhang entered the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1899 to learn artillery tactics and strategy, and after returning to China, he joined Yuan Shikai's Beiyang Army. In 1906 he was transferred to Fengtian Province, during which he secretly joined the Tongmenghui. In the 1911 revolution, he did not obey orders to suppress the rebellion, and instead pushed for a constitutional monarchy. After the revolution, he was appointed by Yuan Shikai as Governor of Suiyuan. In 1917, he participated in the activities of Duan Qirui against Zhang Xun. In 1920, he joined the Zhili Clique because he was a relative with Wu Peifu and Feng Yuxiang, and his close personal friendship with Cao Kun. He served in a variety of ministerial positions throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, and narrowly dodged an assassination attempt in 1928 ordered by Zhang Zuolin.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe is good at acupuncture and likes to practice martial arts.\nHe is well-known as an eccentric and strange figure. Frequently, he has been heard to mutter 'I am a reincarnation of a Buddha. Most people are the reincarnation of my subordinates. But there are also some demons in this world, I hope that the gods can give me an axe, which I will use to destroy the demons.'"
QIE_DU_XIJUN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nHejian, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nDu was one of many Chinese students sent abroad to study Japanese military tactics as part of the Qing Dynasty's attempted modernising reforms prior to the revolution. Du's exact role in the events of 1911 have been heavily disputed, with some claiming he was initially loyal to the Qing, and other accusing him of being a key figure in organising the Wuchang Uprising. The story as told by Du himself and his Zhili allies has been heavily revised to put him on the right side of history. From 1926 and forward he served as Wu Peifu's handpicked governor of Hubei province, initially struggling to oppose the Kuomintang's invasion of Zhili controlled territory during the Northern Expedition. After the Zhili Clique managed to turn the tide of the war, Du assumed full control of Hubei, managing to stabilizing the war torn province into a loyal stronghold of Zhili influence. His ties to Japan kept him from being promoted too highly within the Zhili command structure, but following the reforms enacted by Wu in the wake of the LEP collapse he has been promoted to the high command."
QIE_WANG_LINGYUN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 27th, 1899\nLuoyang, Henan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWang Lingyun joined Wu Peifu’s engineer battalion in 1920, however not long after that he enrolled in the Yiyang academy. After his graduation in 1924, he joined the Zhensong Army led by Liu Zhenhua. During the Northern Expedition, the Zhensong Army aligned with Zhili Clique and fought against NRA, subsequently participating in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War. For his outstanding performance Wang was integrated into Zhili Clique and entered Wu Peifu's personal circle, serving as an advisor for engineering and fortification matters. Following the reforms enacted by Wu and other senior Zhili generals, he was promoted to Brigadier General, the youngest ever in the Imperial Army. Skilled in fortification and defensive tactics, he has supported Jiang Baili's Plan to defend China from Japansese invasion."
QIE_GUO_JIJIAO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 15th, 1902\nHefei, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAfter Guo Jiyu’s primary school graduation, he was admitted to the county’s middle school, but he eventually had to stop because of his brother’s high school fees and instead transferred to the Beijing Military Academy. In 1917, Guo Jiyu entered the Qinghe Army's First Preparatory Officer School. Two years later, he was assigned to the First Division of the Frontier Defence Artillery Corps and the Northwest Frontier Defence Second Mixed Brigade. In 1921, Guo transferred to the Baoding Army Military Academy, and graduated with full honours in 1923. There, he became involved with the Zhili clique, though his young aged prevented rapid promotion. He became allies with Liu Menggeng during this period as well, and with Liu being chosen to spearhead his national defence plan, Guo was promoted to full General status.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nA secretary once told a visiting author an anecdote about Guo's hectic work ethic: '... (At his table) there are four or five telephones as well as telegrams and official documents. Guo went to work every morning at 8:00 A.M., retired in the afternoon to go home to eat two meals, then returned, and worked furiously until 11:00 in the evening, holding a telephone in one hand to listen to battlefield reports, while holding a pen in other. Documents he approved are thrown onto the ground, where a junior officer respectfully picks them up and sends them off.'"
QIE_WEI_YISAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 25th, 1884\nGaocheng, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWei Yishann attended the Baoding Army Military Academy School, and in 1920, he served as the head of the 4th Mixed Military Brigade of the Northwest Frontier Defence Force. In 1921, he joined the Fengtian Clique and served as the head of the 39th Regiment, switching over to teaching in 1923, when he served as the instructor of the Northeast Army, and later served as the chief of staff of the 27th Division of the Northeast Army, as well as a variety of other commands throughout the early 1920s. In May 1926, however, he deserted the Fengtian and joined Wu Peifu’s Zhili Clique. A capable officer, Wei ingratiated himself with Liu Menggeng in the early 1930s, and when his defence plan was selected for China Wei was promoted to full General rank."
QIE_STILLWELL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 19th, 1883\nPalatka, Florida, USA\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nFollowing the defeat of democratic forces in the Second American Civil War, Joseph Stillwell, former Federalist commander, has fled to China with a few of his former soldiers. During the 1920s and early 30s he served as military attaché to the Qing Empire, and during the time him and Wu grew close friends. Following the Fall of Washington and the widespread exile of many former Federalists, Stillwell and his men initially escaped to Canada. Disliking the internecine bickering in the Republic in Exile, Stillwell utilized his connections in China to secure a position with the Beijing government. Him and his men sailed soon after, arriving in China to help train the disorganised Chinese forces with their years of experience in the ruins of the United States.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nBecame an expert in urban warfare during the Siege of New York."
QIE_FRANK_MERRILL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 4th, 1903\nHopkinton, Massachusetts, USA\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA West Point graduate and veteran of the Second American Civil War, Frank Merrill fled to China after the end of the conflict along with his commanding officer, Joseph Stillwell. Merrill spent most of the war fighting in the swamps of Florida, leading his band of Federal troops on an insurgent campaign against Longist forces in the opening days of the war. Renowned for his ability to fight in environments most men would never dare set foot in, Merrill has already proven himself a valuable ally of the Zhili regime."
QIE_DU_XIGUI_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nNovember 12th, 1874\nFuzhou, Fujian, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\nBorn into a poor family, Du followed his brothers footsteps and joined the navy to escape his family's impoverished situation. He graduated from the Nanjing Jiangnan Naval Academy in 1902, before going on to further education in the United Kingdom. This was followed by a career in the modernising Qing navy, where Du served on and captained some of the largest ships under Chinese control. During the Wuchang uprising, he deserted the Qing Empire, and aligned himself with the Zhili Clique. During the Zhili-dominated government of 1923/1924 he served as Minister of the Navy. During the KMT’s Northern Expedition a large number of his sailors nearly convinced him to desert, but the presence of German warships kept him in line, and he supported the German Navy in their coastal bombardment missions. Restored to his position of Minister of the Navy, Du has little time left for active ship command.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHad an extensive opium and drinking habit in his youth. Though he largely recovered, the upheaval of the 1920s has pushed him back into heavy drinking."
QIE_WU_RENLI_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1874\nHefei, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\nDetails on Wu’s early life are scarce, but In 1890, he entered the Weihai Marine Academy, though it appears he transferred to the Tianjin Beiyang Naval Academy and graduated with honours in 1896. He held a variety of teaching positions at the Baoding military academy throughout the 1910s, including as a teacher of both French and English. Here, he became acquainted with many future Zhili Clique generals. Quickly promoted through the ranks, Wu stayed largely isolated from many of the political turmoils that ensnared fellow naval officers, and has a reputation of being somewhat ‘apolitical’ - or the closest to apolitical one can get in this period in Chinese history. A competent officer, Wu has served with distinction throughout the 1920s and 1930s."
QIE_SA_ZHENBING_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 30th, 1859\nHefei, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\nBorn into a family of Qarluk descent, Sa attended the Fuzhou Naval Academy, graduating 1872. After this, he attended the Royal Naval College in the United Kingdom, where he came face to face with modern naval innovations. Returning home, he participated in the Sino-Japanese war, where as the youngest commander in the Qing Navy he was forced to surrender to the Japanese after the Battle of Weihawei after all his commanding officers committed suicide. Leading the naval reforms after the peace treaty was signed, Sa was largely oblivious to the larger political maelstrom brewing in China. During the Wuchang uprising he faced a full-scale mutiny, and retired to Shanghai rather than either fire on his own men, or betray his country. He briefly served as Acting Premier in 1920, before taking the largely ceremonial position of the Governor of Fujian in 1922, where he essentially planned to retire. Here, he became acquainted with the Zhili clique and began to advise Wu and other, junior members of the Navy on modernising the ageing fleet. Following the Manchu Restoration in 1927, Sa formally re-joined naval high command to help spearhead the adoption of new German tactics and ships."
QIE_ZAIXUN_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 20th, 1885\nBeijing, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\nZaixun was adopted into the lineage of his relative, Yizhi (1827–1850), because Yizhi had no son to succeed him. In 1887, he was made a buru bafen fuguo gong, and was subsequently promoted to feng'en fuguo gong in 1889 and feng'en zhenguo gong in 1890. In 1900, Zaixun's predecessor, Zaiyi, who succeeded Yizhi as 'Prince Rui of the Second Rank' (later renamed to 'Prince Duan of the Second Rank'), was stripped off his title of nobility and exiled to Xinjiang for his role in the Boxer Rebellion. Two years later, Zaixun succeeded Zaiyi as a beile of the Prince Rui peerage. In 1908, he was made an acting junwang (Prince of the Second Rank) but remained nominally a beile. In 1909, Zaixun was appointed as an acting Navy Minister in the Imperial Cabinet headed by Prince Qing. Later, he was sent to Europe and the United States to study the navies of the Western powers. After returning to China, in 1911, he became a full Navy Minister. Following Puyi's autocoup, he has come out of retirement to serve again as Navy minister. Despite never holding a battle command in his life he has been granted an admiralship. It is yet to be seen if he can competently command a warship in battle."

QIE_LING_BIN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 17th, 1910\nBeijing, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into an upper-middle class merchant family, Ling grew up in the most cutting-edge academic circles in Beijing, with his parents being members of the Chinese Empire Reform Association, the predecessor of the NCERA. Only 17 during Puyi's restoration, the corruption and scandal that plagued the new empire greatly dismayed the impressionable young man, and on the suggestion of a friend he attended clandestine meetings of the Young China Party. From those meetings he attended the Baoding military academy, where he quickly stood out as both politically and militarily shrewd. Along with Fang Zhejian he assembled a group of young cadets dedicated to reforming the Empire. Interestingly, Ling was not a rabid anti-monarchist, and quickly appreciated how Wu Peifu and the Zhili had manipulated Puyi to serve as a legitimising symbol of the regime."
QIE_FANG_ZHIJIAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nAugust 1st, 1909\nHuanggang, Hubei, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nHailing from a poor peasant family, Fang's teachers in the village school noticed the young boy excelled in all of his lessons. Cobbling together a small sum of money, they sent the young boy to the local provincial secondary school. Unfortunately for Fang, warlord soldiers arrived in the provincial capital and burned the school, nearly killing Fang. The young man was left with a scar running down his leg and a burning hatred for warlords and the chaos they inflicted on the poor of China. After taking the entrance exams to Baoding Military Academy, he joined the Young China Party branch at the campus, though his sympathies lay more with the NCERA. He led one of the squads that arrested and executed senior Zhili leadership during the coup, and the command experience he picked up there made him stand out so much to Li Bingzhi that he promoted the young man on the spot."

QIE_zhili:0 "Qing Zhili Focus Tree"

### Focuses ###
QIE_yearofrat:0 "Year of the Rat"
QIE_yearofrat_desc:0 "As the nation prepares for the celebrations of the Chinese New Year on January 24th, Assembly President Cao Kun and Wu Peifu have begun drafting a speech to mark the fourth year of concerted anti-trade debt efforts. The largest issue currently facing the central government, the Zhili clique hopes to tackle this problem even as whispers of unrest emerge from the League of Eight Provinces."
QIE_taxes1:0 "New Taxes"
QIE_taxes1_desc:0 "Tax collection in the warlord era ranged from semi-organised to completely ad-hoc. Even though most people will resent the new taxes, enacting them through an established legislative body will hopefully mitigate some the unpopularity, as a tax-man is better than a horde of rapacious soldiers."
QIE_subsistancefarming1:0 "Encourage Export Farming"
QIE_subsistancefarming1_desc:0 "We do not have the industrial base required to enact large-scale industrial reform. What we do not lack, however, is a large number of peasant farmers. By carefully granting out subsidies to farmers, we can start to nurture a food-export system that can alleviate our trade debt."
QIE_emergencysession:0 "Emergency Meeting of Senior Zhili Members"
QIE_emergencysession_desc:0 "The unrest in the south has exploded into full-blown chaos. Rioting and looting are widespread, and civil authority has broken down. Wu Peifu must call a meeting of the senior Zhili generals and bureaucrats, in order to properly respond to this developing situation."
QIE_capitalize_politics:0 "New Elections"
QIE_capitalize_politics_desc:0 "Previous elections have seen the Harmony Association win by a razor-thin margin.  With our recent anti-concession turn, however, we can exploit our newfound popularity to bolster the legitimacy of our regime. "
QIE_meetwithassembly:0 "Meet with Assembly Parties"
QIE_meetwithassembly_desc:0 "The dissent generated by our decision to remain loyal to the Germans has not reached down to the lower classes yet. By meeting with leaders from the major parties in the Assembly, we can placate them and ensure that they at least pretend to support our regime."
QIE_futureofzhili:0 "Future of the Zhili Clique"
QIE_futureofzhili_desc:0 "The upheaval of the last few months has shown that the Zhili clique must reform itself if it is to survive the next few years, let alone the next few decades. We need to create a (reasonably) meritocratic promotion system in our military, and eliminate some of the most egregious corruption from our government, or we will to fade into obscurity."
QIE_civil_military_relationship:0 "A Healthy Civil-Military Relationship"
QIE_civil_military_relationship_desc:0 ""
QIE_default_debt:0 "Default on Debt"
QIE_default_debt_desc:0 "All other options have failed. The withdraw of German financial support means a full-scale international default on our debt is the only option to solve our financial crisis. It will certainly harm us in the short-term, but with any luck this will pay off in the long term."
QIE_nationalize_germans:0 "Nationalise German Industry"
QIE_nationalize_germans_desc:0 "A great deal of businesses were wholly or partly by German financial concerns prior to their withdrawal of financial support for our regime. We can move in and nationalise these industries, helping our domestic industry. Germany, concerned with Black Monday, cannot retaliate beyond some angry telegrams."
QIE_locallogistics:0 "Local Logistics"
QIE_locallogistics_desc:0 "Germany had promised to supply us with trucks and other logistical equipment for our future conflict with Japan. With their military mission's withdrawal, however, we need to turn to more traditional logistical methods to supply our army. In the end, this might be better news for us, as the infrastructure of our country cannot really support large amounts of motorized vehicles anyway."
QIE_buyforeignguns:0 "Purchase Foreign Arms"
QIE_buyforeignguns_desc:0 "Our anti-concession stance prevents us from dealing with those countries that participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion, but there are many countries in the world that respected our sovereignty in that calamitous era. Austria, Scandinavia, and other nations have military equipment that could be useful to our nation."
QIE_siciliyships:0 "Commission Ships from Sicily"
QIE_siciliyships_desc:0 "Sicily did not participate in the suppression of the Boxer movement, and their dockyards are some of the largest in the world. Our navy will never be able to stand up to Japan's in a head-to-head showdown, but escorts for coastal defence and submarines for light raiding could help us in our upcoming conflicts."
QIE_stealplanedesigns:0 "'Acquire' Foreign Airplane Designs"
QIE_stealplanedesigns_desc:0 "We lack designs for domestic aircraft production, and promises of German designs never came to fruition for obvious reasons. Some of the more salacious Zhili generals have suggested sending infiltrators to the airfields of the Legation Cities with the hopes of finding schematics in the repair hangers there. It's an audacious plan, but we don't have many other options."
QIE_chinesenavalacademy:0 "Create a Zhili Naval Academy"
QIE_chinesenavalacademy_desc:0 "Many of our junior naval staff received training from the German naval academy, and their loyalty to our clique remains unclear at best. We need to divert funds to create our own naval academy, where promising cadets can be trained to be both skilled tacticians, and loyal to our government."
QIE_expatairtraining:0 "Expat Air Training Scheme"
QIE_expatairtraining_desc:0 "While a fledgling domestic air training industry exists, it may be more prudent to hire various exiles and expatiates that wash up in the Legations to train our pilots. They may need to sober up before teaching any of our cadets to fly, but crashing is part of the training process, right?"
QIE_supportcompanies:0 "Develop Zhili Engineer Corps"
QIE_supportcompanies_desc:0 "China's rugged terrain necessitates any military force having a strong engineering corps to support it. Unfortunately, the ad-hoc and amateur quality of many of our divisions prevents engineering support from being truly effective. We must develop our own military engineering schools, in order to ensure our troops have adequate support."
QIE_reorganize_divisions:0 "Re-Organise Warlord Divisions"
QIE_reorganize_divisions_desc:0 "Any warlord worth anything has his own personal militia to control the territory he rules. Unfortunately, these troops vary wildly in quality from semi-professional troops to mobs more used to robbing and burning the villages they theoretically protect. By devoting considerable resources to standardizing and modernising these divisions, we can turn them into valuable assets on the battlefield."
QIE_zhili_flood_dams:0 "Prepare to Breach Dams"
QIE_zhili_flood_dams_desc:0 "A shocking plan has been developed by senior Zhili strategists - the breaching of major dams along the Yellow River. This would cause widespread flooding, and halt any enemy advances. The cost in civilian casualties and economic damage, however, would be immense."
QIE_studywars:0 "Old Methods, New Designs"
QIE_studywars_desc:0 "While generals in Europe experiment with 'armoured warfare' and other cutting-edge ideas, our strategists have learned one lesson from the last decade of internecine warfare - artillery is king. By modernising our artillery stockpiles, we can ensure they go into battle with the best fire support available."
QIE_work_with_manchu:0 "Work with Manchu Generals"
QIE_work_with_manchu_desc:0 "While some of the younger Manchu generals are little more than jumped-up noblemen, the older guard like Aisin-Gioro Xiqia can impart valuable lessons on cavalry tactics to the Zhili. At the same time, Zhili generals can teach the younger Manchu the skills they learned over the last few decades of strife and warfare."
QIE_expand_peking_uni:0 "Expand Peking University"
QIE_expand_peking_uni_desc:0 "Peking (Beijing) University has a large focus on literature, art, and culture. While important, these things do not win wars. We can divert funding to Peking University with the purpose of building new research and development labs for computer, radio, and chemical advancement, all of which will help our military."
QIE_zhili_mercs:0 "Hire Foreign Advisors"
QIE_zhili_mercs_desc:0 "Our anti-concession stance keeps us from taking military aid from European governments, but individual, independent advisors are fair game. The turmoil and conflict of the last twenty years has generated no shortage of men willing to sell their talents and advice to the highest bidder."
QIE_jiangbailiplan:0 "Jiang Baili's Plan"
QIE_jiangbailiplan_desc:0 "General Jiang Baili's plan is focused on static fortifications, defensive tactics, and preparing for Japanese naval invasions at the coast. While some have criticized him for stealing ideas from his subordinates, this is still a solid plan to defend our country."
QIE_hubeigenerals:0 "Court Hubei Generals"
QIE_hubeigenerals_desc:0 "The 'Hubei Generals' are an informal association of the leading manufacturers and industrialists in the Hubei province. Jiang Baili's close family friend, General Xiao Yaonan, is governor of the province, and has graciously volunteered to use his industrial contacts for the construction of many of the fortifications required for Jiang's plan."
QIE_gongxianarsenal:0 "Expand Gongxian Arsenal"
QIE_gongxianarsenal_desc:0 "The Gongxian Arsenal has normally played second fiddle to the much larger Hanyang weapons foundry. Yet by expanding its manufacturing capabilities, we can sufficiently spread out our industrial base in case one arsenal falls into the hands of invaders."
QIE_modern_contracts:0 "Modernise Armament Contracts"
QIE_modern_contracts_desc:0 "Previously, contracts for the production of weapons were handed out on an ad-hoc basis, rife with corruption. By exerting considerable political willpower, we can modernise and clean up these systems, bringing our arms industry up to western standards."
QIE_fallout_of_northwest_conflict:0 "Fallout of the Northwest Conflict"
QIE_fallout_of_northwest_conflict_desc:0 "While not as important as the coastal areas in our upcoming struggle, the interior of China still contains valuable riches that we must secure for our upcoming conflict. The Northwest Conflict has concluded, and we should start to look to make the best of however that war ended."
QIE_destroy_isolated_warlords:0 "Destroy Isolated Warlords"
QIE_destroy_isolated_warlords_desc:0 "While we are mainly focusing on building up a defensive capability against Fengtian and Japan, there are also numerous small, isolated warlords around us without much protection. We should destroy these scattered groups and integrate their territory directly into ours."
QIE_rebuild_alliance:0 "Rebuild Zhili Coalition"
QIE_rebuild_alliance_desc:0 "Before the League Collapse, we were the undisputed masters of China. Many of our former allies have not completely deserted us, and we should reach out to them to build a strong bulwark against Japanese and Fengtian encroachment."
QIE_jinghanRR:0 "Improve the Jinghan Railroad"
QIE_jinghanRR_desc:0 "The Jinghan Railway links all the major industrial and agricultural heartlands of our state. We should upgrade its capacity, in order to more efficiently move soldiers and war matériel."
QIE_liumenggengplan:0 "Liu Menggeng's Plan"
QIE_liumenggengplan_desc:0 "General Liu Menggeng's plan focuses on improving logistics and support networks for our troops, so they can be better able to fight. The trade off for this, however, is less industrial capacity dedicated to building defensive fortifications."
QIE_expandmines:0 "Reorganise the Kailuan Mining Bureau"
QIE_expandmines_desc:0 "The Kailuan mining Bureau was founded in 1878 as a joint venture between the Qing government and a variety of British business interests. Largely destroyed during the fighting of the warlord era, we must rebuild and reorganise the mines to fuel our war efforts."
QIE_devscheme:0 "Daye-Hanyang Development Scheme"
QIE_devscheme_desc:0 "The Daye-Hanyang corridor houses the majority of our industrial capacity outside of Beijing, yet the infrastructure and urban planning in the region leaves much to be desired. By investing into clearing new land for factories, and building additional civilian industry to support military arsenals, we can modernise the region."
QIE_shanxicoal:0 "Expand Shanxi Coal Fields"
QIE_shanxicoal_desc:0 "Seized from Yan Xishan at the end of the last Zhifeng war, the coal fields of Shanxi are some of the most prosperous in China. We should invest in these coal fields, in order to fuel our growing industry. This may provoke Yan though, so we must tread with caution."
QIE_baodingarsenal:0 "Expand Baoding Arsenal"
QIE_baodingarsenal_desc:0 "Baoding arsenal, attached to the military academy, is somewhat less developed than the Gongxian foundry. Yet with enough investments, we can turn it into one of China's main military manufacturers. Its proximity to the Academy is also a plus, as it allows us to test new equipment designs both practically and theoretically."
QIE_warofnationalresistance:0 "War of National Resistance"
QIE_warofnationalresistance_desc:0 "At last, the moment has come. Japanese troops, seeking to turn our great nation into little more than a resource extraction colony, have invaded. Any lingering doubts about the legitimacy of our government have been put to rest as we unite to destroy the invaders!"
QIE_looseends:0 "Tying up Loose Ends"
QIE_looseends_desc:0 "We have triumphed over the Japanese menace! Now all that remains is to secure the territory we claim outside of the heartland of China. Mongolia, Tibet, and other far-flung provinces must be brought to heel!"
QIE_endconcessions:0 "Eradicate the Concessions"
QIE_endconcessions_desc:0 "The concessions, long a stain on Chinese sovereignty, have remained in existence for too long! Macau, the Legation Cities, and the remnants of German colonialism must be brought under our direct control, either through negotiation or direct action!"
QIE_unitedchina:0 "China, United!"
QIE_unitedchina_desc:0 "At last - the dream of a united China has been fulfilled! The century of humiliation has been reversed, and now we must chart our path forward into this brave new world. "
QIE_salvage_german_industry:0 "Salvage German Designs"
QIE_salvage_german_industry_desc:0 "In their haste to flee back to their concessions, the Peking-Kommission and German investors left large amounts of industrial machinery behind. We should salvage these designs, and attempt to retro-engineer them for our own purposes."
QIE_leverage_new_pop:0 "Attract Anti-Concession Intellectuals"
QIE_leverage_new_pop_desc:0 "Our intervention in favour of Governor Chen has bolstered the legitimacy of our government by margins previously thought impossible for a 'warlord government'. By recruiting former NCERA intellectuals into our government, we can further legitimise our regime."
QIE_on_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
QIE_on_our_own_desc:0 "Our decision to take an anti-concession stance has robbed us of German military support. No matter! We shall turn to our other resources and the will of the people to defend ourselves."
QIE_hire_republican_officers:0 "Hire Former Republican Officers"
QIE_hire_republican_officers_desc:0 "Many former Republican officers and NCOs were disgusted by our support of the Qing restoration. With the Manchu overthrown and our new anti-concession stance, however, we may be able to recruit them back into our military, bringing with them their considerable experience."
QIE_open_up_to_investment:0 "Simplify International Investment Laws"
QIE_open_up_to_investment_desc:0 "Despite German influence, our international investment laws remain a byzantine web of red tape, restrictions, and loopholes. By simplifying these laws, we can attract additional international investment to build up our industry and military."
QIE_harmonious_balance:0 "Harmonious Balance"
QIE_harmonious_balance_desc:0 "Few thought it possible, but we have managed to build a delicate balance between intellectuals, Manchu nobles, the Zhili Clique, and the Emperor himself. The common person now regards our government as a legitimate entity, and is willing to support it, at least most of the time."
QIE_baoding_zhili_cooperation:0 "Encourage Baoding-Zhili Cooperation"
QIE_baoding_zhili_cooperation_desc:0 "The cadets at the Boading Military Academy, most of which joined the YCP, long resented the continued influence of Germany and other foreign powers over our government. With our new anti-concession stance, however, they have started to support our regime. By drawing them into the Zhili command structure, we can ensure their loyalty for years to come."
QIE_guardian_of_emperor:0 "Spread Pro-Imperial Propaganda"
QIE_guardian_of_emperor_desc:0 "Many in the Manchu Party have long accused the Zhili clique of sidelining Puyi. By spreading propaganda promoting the Emperor to our troops, however, we can both increase their fervour to fight and placate the Manchu nobles."
QIE_lesson_of_intervention:0 "Lessons of the Intervention"
QIE_lesson_of_intervention_desc:0 "The intervention in the League collapse has taught us many valuable lessons about modern warfare. We should put these to use before we deal with any larger conflicts."
QIE_lesson_of_coup:0 "Lessons of the Coup Attempt"
QIE_lesson_of_coup_desc:0 "The failed attempt to overthrow the Zhili clique at the hands of the traitorous Manchu has failed, but it revealed worrying problems with our internal security systems. We must rebuild our domestic intelligence apparatus, and ensure it can prevent future insurrections."
QIE_placateassembly:0 "Placate the Assembly"
QIE_placateassembly_desc:0 "Our decisions to deepen ties with Germany generated some unrest, but more importantly it drove a wedge between us and opposition groups in the National Assembly. They have no real power, but having a loud opposition group certainly won't help us in the long run. We need to placate these groups through whatever means necessary to ensure their loyalty."
QIE_future_relationship:0 "Future Relationships"
QIE_future_relationship_desc:0 "The defeat of Japan and the Fengtian Government raises new questions for us on the international stage. Should we draw closer to Germany, maybe even joining the Reichspakt? Or instead turn inwards and focus on developing our nation."
QIE_request_german_bailout:0 "Request German Bailout"
QIE_request_german_bailout_desc:0 "Our continued international trade debt continues to prevent us from making any meaningful industrial progress as a nation. While it may enrage die-hard nationalists, asking Germany for an international bailout will solve the problem of our debt and allow us to modernise."
QIE_germanarsenal:0 "Loyalty has its Own Rewards..."
QIE_germanarsenal_desc:0 "German weapons and technology has its own set of benefits, despite the drawbacks associated with closer ties to Germany. Panzers, aircraft and more lie at our disposal, provided we are able to give concessions to the Peking-Kommission, of course."
QIE_germandesigns:0 "Purchase German Production Licenses"
QIE_germandesigns_desc:0 "German weapon designs won them the Weltkrieg, and we have a long history of using German designs in domestic Chinese arsenals. We should try and purchase licences to build the newest German designs and give us an edge on our enemies."
QIE_germanradio:0 "Study German Support Company Doctrine"
QIE_germanradio_desc:0 "German divisions are innovative in incorporating the newest radios, engineering equipment and other support equipment. We should study their doctrine and seek to emulate it with our own military units."
QIE_kriegsmarine:0 "Purchase Surplus German Ships"
QIE_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "The German navy underwent a rapid expansion and modernisation program after the Weltkrieg, and a huge number of German ships currently sit in mothball doing nothing. We should reach out to Germany and inquire about purchasing these old ships for our own use."
QIE_luftwaffe:0 "License Luftstreitkräfte Airplanes"
QIE_luftwaffe_desc:0 "While they might be hesitant to sell us their newest designs, Germany needs to keep Japan at bay. What better way of doing that then giving some of their planes to us?"
QIE_motorized_armor:0 "Import Panzers and Trucks"
QIE_motorized_armor_desc:0 "German Panzers and trucks are some of the most feared fighting machines in the world, and some of our younger officers are enthusiastic about their combat potential. We should see about licensing some from German foundries and using them in our battles against the Japanese."
QIE_buymauser:0 "Import German Small Arms"
QIE_buymauser_desc:0 "German small arms designs are some of the most cutting-edge in the world. We should seek to directly import some to better equip our soldiers."
QIE_germanattache:0 "German Attaché"
QIE_germanattache_desc:0 "While German weapons are welcome, what we really need are German soldiers to help train our troops. The Peking-Kommission has just informed us that a crack group of elite German soldiers can be dispatched from Berlin, as soon as we divert some funding their way."
QIE_seek_german_civ_investments:0 "Partner with German Manufacturing Firms"
QIE_seek_german_civ_investments_desc:0 "German businesses frequently run into issues like unions and worker's rights at home. We can offer them land to build factories here and provide a workforce that will have no such complaints."
QIE_grant_foreign_licenses:0 "Purchase German Tooling Equipment"
QIE_grant_foreign_licenses_desc:0 "While we can build our own factories easily, what we really need is high-quality German tooling equipment. If acquired in enough numbers, we can jump-start our industry and allow it to quickly rise to a Western level."
QIE_seek_german_RR_capital:0 "Hire German Rail Engineers"
QIE_seek_german_RR_capital_desc:0 "Much of our rail network was constructed by European firms. While some might bristle at continuing to use them to build our railroads, they are the undisputed masters of the craft. We should seek out German railroad engineers and directly hire them to improve our infrastructure."
QIE_krupp:0 "Import Krupp Steel"
QIE_krupp_desc:0 "While most domestically produced steel is lacking in quality, Krupp is the international byword for quality. We should import large amounts of it to build our industrial network instead of relying on lower-quality domestic material."
QIE_siemens:0 "Purchase Siemens Radios"
QIE_siemens_desc:0 "Radios are a godsend in an enormous country like China, and ensuring our troops can coordinate their battle tactics is key. Siemens is the German king of radios, and we should import some to equip our troops."

QIE_IGfarben_desc: "China lacks much oil and rubber production, but with new German chemical formulas we can synthetically produce some."
QIE_germanresearch:0 "University Exchange Program"
QIE_germanresearch_desc:0 "The best way to learn is to experience other cultures. By sending some Chinese students to German universities, they can return home with the latest knowledge and information. One hopes the Germans students who study here will learn something of our culture, and take it home to share with their countrymen."
QIE_debt_issue:0 "Solving the Debt Issue"
QIE_debt_issue_desc:0 "The debt issue that plagued the empire still plagues our new republic. While we could ask Germany for help, that would most likely cause our already unstable regime to collapse under public pressure. Instead, let's default and take an anti-concession stance, providing our government with legitimacy. It's not like the Germans ever liked us much beyond Puyi..."
QIE_restoration:0 "The Manchu Restoration"
QIE_restoration_desc:0 "In an almost unthinkable turn of events, strategic blunders made by Cao Kun and Wu Peifu have destroyed their own regime, with some of their former allies betraying them alongside the Manchu. The future of the new regime is uncertain, to say the least..."
QIE_wu_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
QIE_wu_constitution_desc:0 "With the Manchu overthrown, we must now set about building a new constitution for our regime. While it will still be 'guided' by the Zhili, many are hopeful for the return of republican rule to Beijing."
QIE_unrest:0 "Deal with Unrest"
QIE_unrest_desc:0 "Our decision to stay neutral in the League collapse has pleased nobody and angered everyone. We need to quickly suppress unrest before the situation becomes untenable."
QIE_president_hu:0 "Implement President Hu's Reforms"

QIE_president_koo:0 "Implement President Koo's Reforms"
QIE_president_koo_desc:0 "President Koo is a grey eminence, one of the world's most paramount diplomatic minds. We should put his expertise to work building international legitimacy for our regime and seeking new trade deals."
QIE_pragmatism:0 "Pragmatism"
QIE_pragmatism_desc:0 "Pragmatism, the philosophy espoused by Hu Shih, encourages cooperation with potentially unsavoury elements of the political environment in order to bring about the most productive changes. We should apply this theory to the workings of our government to better legitimise the 'warlord' elements of our government."
QIE_diplomacy:0 "Diplomatic Genius"
QIE_diplomacy_desc:0 "Wellington Koo served our nation as ambassador to both the United States and the Copenhagen Conference. We should ensure his diplomatic ideals are transferred down to a new foreign service that can create international trade deals with the nations of the world."
QIE_eradicate_manchu:0 "Eradicate Manchu Remnants"
QIE_eradicate_manchu_desc:0 "While we may have destroyed the largest concentration of Manchu nobles, some fled Beijing and are hiding around the city. We must send police to arrest these traitors, and confiscate their wealth and use it for the benefits of the Republic."
QIE_elimiate_baoding:0 "Destroy Baoding Cliques"

QIE_deligitimize_oppo:0 "Delegitimise Opposition Parties"
QIE_deligitimize_oppo_desc:0 "While the Assembly was a powerless body, it still forced us to pay lip service to the whims of nobles and out of touch urban elites. We should de-legitimise these aristocratic groups, and instead focus on the true needs of the people of our great republic."
QIE_placate_intellectuals:0 "Placate Intellectuals"
QIE_placate_intellectuals_desc:0 "The NCERA holds a great degree of popularity among the intellectuals of Beijing. With our new anti-concession stance, however, we can try and integrate them into the republican government, unifying them behind our new ideology."
QIE_rebuild_arsenals:0 "Rebuild Arsenals"
QIE_rebuild_arsenals_desc:0 "Fighting outside the Baoding Military Academy in the wake of the coup attempt left the arsenal damaged. We should rip out the destroyed parts of the foundry and put in new machinery instead, upgrading our production capacity."
QIE_rebuild_domestic_ind:0 "Rebuild Civilian Industry"
QIE_rebuild_domestic_ind_desc:0 "The riots and violence that engulfed Beijing destroyed large parts of the city, including some industry. We should clear the rubble and build larger, more advanced factories on top of the ruins."
QIE_stable_republic:0 "The Republic Triumphant"
QIE_stable_republic_desc:0 "The Zhili Clique has repeated its triumph of 1927, defeating all other 'republican' governments in China. Without Germany to impose a puppet emperor on us, we can truly begin to foster democracy in China. Long live the Republic!"
QIE_purge_zhili:0 "Secure North China Plain"
QIE_purge_zhili_desc:0 "While the forces loyal to the coup control Beijing and the areas surrounding the Baoding Military Academy, the rest of our territory remains under the control of traitorous Zhili warlords. We need to first secure the northern frontier, eliminating the Zhili garrisons there before turning our eyes south."
QIE_coup_backer:0 "Our New Benefactor"
QIE_coup_backer_desc:0 "The coup that destroyed the Zhili clique was not accomplished alone. Like it or not, in order to reclaim our country from the despotic warlords we had to cut a deal with local powers in the region. Now we must invite them to Beijing and see what they want in exchange for their support."
QIE_zhang_tianran:0 "Zhang Tianran"
QIE_zhang_tianran_desc:0 "The Honoured Master of the Yiguandao sect, Zhang Tianran commands an enormous amount of clout among the followers of his religion. His desired position in our government is unclear, but it appears that he is willing to lend us the support of the Yiguandao in return for unknown concessions..."
QIE_song_zheyuan:0 "Song Zheyuan"
QIE_song_zheyuan_desc:0 "The governor of Shandong, Song Zheyuan has long been a Qing loyalist. While he wants to see the monarchy modernised, he also emphasises tradition and maintaining continuity with our past."
QIE_yan_xishan:0 "Yan Xishan"
QIE_yan_xishan_desc:0 "Governor Yan Xishan was an unexpected ally in our coup. Previously an anti-monarchist, his shrewd political mind realized that the Emperor is now a powerful political tool. He primarily desires to work with the YCP in modernising China and spreading his 'Yan Xishan Thought' - a nebulous political philosophy that encompasses traditionalism, liberalism, nationalism, and syndicalism."
QIE_yiguandao:0 "Yiguandao Influences"
QIE_yiguandao_desc:0 "With his new position in our government, Zhang Tianran has begun to expand the Yiguandao's power and influence within our country.

QIE_pick_NCERA:0 "Pick the NCERA"
QIE_pick_NCERA_desc:0 "The New Chinese Empire Reform Association, or NCERA for short, is a powerful party that controls the loyalty of both rural peasants and some urban intellectuals. Though less focused on industrial modernisation, their emphasis on helping the great mass of the population make them extremely popular."
QIE_pick_YCP:0 "Pick the YCP"
QIE_pick_YCP_desc:0 "The Young China Party, or YCP, is made up of young Baoding Academy cadets, with some urban intellectuals providing the funding and organisation. Focused on centralizing the country and urbanization, they lack the broad popular appeal of the NCERA - though their modernising focus makes them a good choice for quick development."
QIE_pick_MP:0 "Pick the Manchu Party"
QIE_pick_MP_desc:0 "The Manchu Party is, obviously, dominated by the Manchu nobility in Beijing. While this may appear an odd choice for a ruling party, over the last ten years the nobles used the relative freedom afforded to them by the Zhili to build up large industrial fortunes, investing in the few factories opened in Beijing not owned by German firms, giving them significant clout."
QIE_rural_reform:0 "Institutionalize the Rural Reform Movement"
QIE_rural_reform_desc:0 "The chaos and destruction of the Warlord Era left large swaths of rural China devastated and destroyed.

QIE_ncera_industry:0 "Invest in Rural Industry"
QIE_ncera_industry_desc:0 "While the little industry China has is currently concentrated in its cities, they are vulnerable to military attack and unrest.

QIE_kang_youwei:0 "The Legacy of Kang Youwei"
QIE_kang_youwei_desc:0 "Kang Youwei was one of the founders of the NCERA, though he passed away soon after its inception in 1927. A brilliant scholar and legal reformer, Kang spent half a century arguing for a constitutional monarchy with an Emperor who truly looked out for his people. With the Zhili overthrown and the NCERA empowered, this dream is close to being a reality."
QIE_rural_infastructure:0 "Modernise Rural Infrastructure"
QIE_rural_infastructure_desc:0 "China's rural infrastructure is shockingly lacking, with some calling it the worst in the world after Africa. Concerted government investment must be made into improving rural transportation networks if we are ever going to lift China's peasantry out of poverty. "
QIE_benevolent_emperor:0 "A Benevolent Emperor"
QIE_benevolent_emperor_desc:0 "While most in the West think the Emperor of China is some sort of despotic warlord straight out of the Middle Ages, we know that the Emperor is a benevolent and kind soul who wants the best for his subjects. Concerted propaganda efforts must be made to ensure that everyone sees our vision as the truth."
QIE_rural_loyalty:0 "Rural Loyalty Ensured"
QIE_rural_loyalty_desc:0 "The NCERA has completed its major rural reform plan and secured its hold on government. Even in areas of China we do not directly control, the people clamour out for our benevolent leadership!

QIE_reform_criminal_justice:0 "Reform the Criminal Justice System"
QIE_reform_criminal_justice_desc:0 "Like many other areas of their government, the Zhili Clique blatantly ignored what little civil laws they bothered to write, preferring to rule via the might of their arms. Now, however, we have the opportunity to completely overhaul China's legal system and create a benevolent system that punishes the guilty while sparing the innocent."
QIE_military_state:0 "Militarize the State"
QIE_military_state_desc:0 "The Zhili Clique, while a military organisation, left large parts of the Qing military completely inefficient and underfunded. In order to rectify this problem, we have begun a whole-sale militarization of the nation. Youth training leagues, a modernised conscription system, and other reforms will ensure we are ready to stand up to what ever enemy we face."
QIE_centralize_state:0 "Centralize the State"
QIE_centralize_state_desc:0 "The last two decades of internecine warlord conflict left China divided and decentralized. From our new position of power in Beijing we must now begin the long, arduous task of centralizing this divided nation, for only then can its people enjoy true peace and prosperity."
QIE_YCP_arsenals:0 "Modernise Arsenals"
QIE_YCP_arsenals_desc:0 "The arsenals that are to supply are war machine are sorely out of date and underfunded. Concerted investment must be made into weapons and ammunition production if we are to stand any chance of victory over our foes."
QIE_destroy_leftists:0 "Destroy Leftists"
QIE_destroy_leftists_desc:0 "While there are few actual leftists within the territory we directly control, the recent KMT uprising to the south has sparked something of a 'Red Scare' within the elite. We can use this to our advantage, drumming up claims of 'socialist infiltration' to bolster our regime and encourage the people to support us."
QIE_emperor_unifier:0 "A Unifying Emperor"
QIE_emperor_unifier_desc:0 "While some may see the Emperor as anachronistic to our modernising, centralising vision, he can serve as a useful tool -  a rallying point around which the formally disparate, decentralized country can unify. Propaganda can be employed to make sure every Chinese - from a farmer on the Yellow River to a goat herder in the steppes of Xinjiang knows they are part of the same nation."
QIE_YCP_modernization:0 "Modernize Civilian Industry"
QIE_YCP_modernization_desc:0 "The few civilian industries not formerly run by the Germans are laughable by Western standards. With the German industrial withdrawal, we can take their designs and apply them to our own factories, modernising them and significantly increasing our industrial output."
QIE_chinese_century:0 "The Chinese Century"
QIE_chinese_century_desc:0 "With our centralizing and modernising reforms complete we enter the world as a rising power, ready to take on our foes and prove to the world once and for all that China is the true master of the East."
QIE_appoint_viceroys:0 "Appoint New Viceroys"
QIE_appoint_viceroys_desc:0 "The provincial governors employed by the Zhili clique were corrupt, inefficient, and, worst of all, disloyal to the Emperor. With our new-found power we can instead appoint viceroys from good, reputable noble families with long and successful histories of provincial government. "
QIE_new_coronation:0 "A New Coronation?"
QIE_new_coronation_desc:0 "A controversial idea has floated around the Manchu nobility ever since the anti-Zhili coup - a second coronation for Puyi. While expensive, this could signal to China and the world we have formally cast off the shackles of warlordism and have entered a new stage of growth and renewal."
QIE_imperial_arsenals:0 "Construct New Imperial Arsenals"
QIE_imperial_arsenals_desc:0 "Much wealth is concentrated in the hands of Manchu nobility. By appealing to their sense of patriotism and loyalty to the Emperor, we can convince them to invest these funds in the construction of new arsenals."
QIE_noble_factories:0 "Grant Factory Licenses to Noble Families"
QIE_noble_factories_desc:0 "With the expulsion all German industrialists in the wake of the coup, many factories they formally ran now lie vacant. We should grant licenses to run these factories to Manchu noble clans that stood by us in the dark days of the Zhili government, to both reward them and ensure our industry is in the hands of those we trust."
QIE_raise_banners:0 "Raise the Banners"
QIE_raise_banners_desc:0 "While the Banner System was mainly dissolved in the wake of the Taiping Rebellion, some Qing generals are now suggesting we create a modern version of the system. While largely adhering to Western divisional organisational structures, we will apply Qing history and legacy to make them truly our own."
QIE_imperial_roads:0 "Imperial Road Project"
QIE_imperial_roads_desc:0 "The road network left by the Zhili bureaucracy is inefficient and poorly maintained. Through contracts with various local dignitaries and the wealth of the imperial treasury, we can set out building a road network worthy of the imperial name!"
QIE_mandate_heaven:0 "The Mandate of Heaven"
QIE_mandate_heaven_desc:0 "Some might claim it an outdated term, but what is the Mandate of Heaven but not a popular expression of the legitimate will of the government? Our scholars will need to update some texts, but with some work we can distribute propaganda that shows that Puyi is the true and legitimate Emperor of China."
QIE_manchu_default_debt:0 "Default on Debt"
QIE_manchu_default_debt_desc:0 "While we have created a new government, international creditors do not see things the same way.

QIE_imperial_consolidation:0 "Pacify the Nation"
QIE_imperial_consolidation_desc:0 "The majority of China is ruled by warlord cliques, leftists, and even worse - republicans. These traitors must be destroyed! Soon, our armies will march out to destroy these rats and unify China behind the banner of the Emperor!"
QIE_demand_fealty:0 "Demand Warlords Bend the Knee"
QIE_demand_fealty_desc:0 "While we must seek out and destroy the leftists and republicans that infest large parts of our country, the more ideologically nebulous warlords may be brought to heel by the threat of our supreme army. If not, then we will simply destroy them."
QIE_destroy_concessions:0 "Eradicate the Concessions"
QIE_destroy_concessions_desc:0 "The Legation Cities are a stain on China's sovereignty and independence. While trade with the West is permissible, the cities are relics of the Century of Humiliation and have no place in our modern government. With the rest of the world embroiled in chaos now is the perfect moment to strike and reclaim our lost cities!"
QIE_destroy_germany:0 "Götterdämmerung"
QIE_destroy_germany_desc:0 "The German concessions in Shandong have allowed the foul Teutons to pollute our country for too long! We must take back these outposts of foreign imperialism while they are distracted at war in Europe."

QIE_rebuild_command_structure:0 "Rebuild our Command Structure"
QIE_rebuild_command_structure_desc:0 "The civil war against the Zhili remnants left our high command in tatters.

QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner:0 "Foreigner Against Foreigner"
QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner_desc:0 "While the German scum polluted our nation with their delusional ideas of racial 'superiority', few denied their military prowess. We should seek out non-aligned foreign agents to help train our military, even if this slightly contradicts our new anti-concession stance. A prepared military is worth a few angry intellectuals. "
QIE_look_to_our_past:0 "Look to our Past"
QIE_look_to_our_past_desc:0 "Instead of turning to the foreigners, let us instead look to the past for inspiration on how to reform our military. The tried and true methods of the Warlord Era are still effective, and will allow us to destroy our enemies."
QIE_assess_doctrines:0 "Assess Doctrines"
QIE_assess_doctrines_desc:0 "The rapidly changing face of modern warfare has necessitated us to take a long hard look at our military doctrine. Should we continue to use plans drawn up by the Zhili, or attempt to devise plans of our own?"
QIE_uneasy_coalition:0 "The Uneasy Coalition"
QIE_uneasy_coalition_desc:0 "Each of the political groups that helped overthrow the Zhili clique have much to offer the military. The NCERA brings the loyalty of the peasantry, the YCP is made up of Baoding cadets, and the Manchu nobility control some of the finest cavalrymen in the nation. While we must all work together to defeat the Japanese, each group may want concessions if they are not in power."
QIE_rural_defense_force:0 "Found the Rural Defence Forces"
QIE_rural_defense_force_desc:0 "For too long the peasantry of China have been terrorized by roving warbands of looters and bandits. The NCERA has proposed enacting a system whereby each village will have its own defence force equipped with obsolete rifles. While of dubious military use, they will be useful at harassing enemies and making our territory costly to occupy."
QIE_prepare_dikes:0 "Prepare the Dikes"

QIE_best_money_can_buy_desc:0 "The Manchu nobility grew rich over the last decade of idleness. We should 'encourage' that this money instead be spent on hiring military advisers from the other war colleges in China, many of which can be encouraged to join our side with a large bag of cash."

QIE_manchu_air_warfare_desc:0 "While we would like to take as little as possible from the foreign devils, there is no debate that their mastery over aerial warfare is undisputed. We should study their doctrine and tactics, so that we may apply them to our own air force."

### National Spirits / Ideas ###
QIE_fractured_empire:0 "Fractured Empire"
QIE_fractured_empire_desc:0 "The Qing Empire theoretically controls all of China outside of Manchuria, Tibet, and Mongolia. In reality, the Emperor’s power barely extends outside the walls of the Forbidden City, while President Cao Kun is largely powerless beyond the assembly floor. Wu Peifu, the real power behind the throne, is more interested in consolidating his power base in Luoyang and balancing military cliques off of each other than improving his country in any meaningful way."
QIE_big_debt:0 "Overwhelming National Debt"
QIE_big_debt_desc:0 "China’s struggle to develop its national economy has resulted in an enormous trade debt fronted by the Beijing government. Industrial machinery is imported at a staggering cost, and what little domestic manufacturing does exist lacks the quality and quantity to compete on the world market. China’s main exports are thus mostly agricultural, and even cash crops fetch low prices compared to widely imported foreign luxuries like cigarettes and radios. This problem is only exacerbated by widespread institutionalized corruption and a thriving opium trade." 
QIE_black_monday:0 "Black Monday"
QIE_black_monday_desc:0 "While most of China has escaped extensive economic fallout stemming from Black Monday, the intertwining of our economy with Germany's has caused a slight hit to economic production."
QIE_leadership_crisis:0 "Zhili Leadership Crisis"
QIE_leadership_crisis_desc:0 "The advanced age of many senior Zhili commanders is a worrying trend that must be rectified soon, lest our army be entirely controlled by old men."
QIE_leadership_crisis_bad:0 "Deepening Leadership Crisis"
QIE_leadership_crisis_bad_desc:0 "The death of several senior Zhili generals has further exacerbated our already dangerous lack of young (or even middle-aged) faces in our high command."
QIE_outraged_parties:0 "Outraged Assembly"
QIE_outraged_parties_desc:0 "Following our decision to support the League of Eight Provinces, the National Assembly erupted into outraged protest. The average peasant does not care too much, but we still need to act quickly to restore stability to our government."
QIE_popular_warlord_idea:0 "Popular Support for Wu Peifu"
QIE_popular_warlord_idea_desc:0 "Following Wu Peifu’s decision to intervene in favor of the anti-concessionist Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, he has seen a marked increase in popular support. While still viewed with some suspicion in some intellectual circles, he has gained a fair bit of legitimacy."
QIE_defaulted_debt:0 "Defaulted Foreign Debt"
QIE_defaulted_debt_desc:0 "In a move to bolster domestic legitimacy, we have defaulted on our international debts. The economic ramifications of this plan will ripple for months, and affect nearly every sector of our economy."
QIE_harmonious_balance_idea:0 "A Harmonious Balance"
QIE_harmonious_balance_idea_desc:0 "Our government has achieved a rare goal - forming and maintaining a harmonious balance between the spiritual power of Emperor and the temporal power of the Zhili Clique."
QIE_local_logistics:0 "Traditional Logistics"
QIE_local_logistics_desc:0 "While we may have been cut off from Western innovations like motorized logistics, China never had the infrastructure to support them anyway. Relying on traditional logistics may not win us any technological awards, but a mule can cross the rugged terrain of this nation easier than a truck."
QIE_german_bailout:0 "German Bailout"
QIE_german_bailout_desc:0 "In our most dire time of need we were forced to turn to our ‘friends’ in Germany one final time. German banks have taken over our enormous trade debt, re-packaged it, and sold it to unsuspecting customers in Germany as ‘stable government bonds’. While this solves our financial problems, it has created a whole new set of political ones."
QIE_diplomatic_genius_idea:0 "New Diplomatic Corps"
QIE_diplomatic_genius_idea_desc:0 "Wellington Koo, a diplomatic mastermind, is spearheading the creation of a new diplomatic corps for the republic. With his skill and expertise, these new diplomats should help reinforce our legitimacy."
QIE_pragmatism_idea:0 "Pragmatism"
QIE_pragmatism_idea_desc:0 "Writer Hu Shih, now President, is famous for his theory of ‘pragmatism’ - instead of uncompromising ideology, it stresses cooperation and conciliation, even with former enemies. It should help our government establish control over the fractured nation."
QIE_encourage_dom_production:0 "Encouraging Domestic Production"
QIE_encourage_dom_production_desc:0 "In an attempt to curtail Prosperity League influences, we have clandestinely diverted subsidies and tax breaks towards domestic goods production. While inefficient, this helps stop German influence from growing too large."

QIE_legitimate_emperor_idea:0 "Defending the Emperor"

QIE_mandate_heaven_idea_desc:0 "While some might claim it an outdated notion, the Manchu Party has successfully re-branded the concept of the ‘Mandate of Heaven’ for a more modern framework of political theory. Instead of emphasizing divine right, new propaganda emphasises how the Emperor acts as a manifestation of the civic forces of China."
QIE_banner_idea:0 "Modern Banner System"
QIE_banner_idea_desc:0 "In an effort to modernise the ad-hoc military left over from the Zhili Clique, the Zhongshe party has attempted to bring back the banner system of the old Qing emperors. This is really just a bit of historical flavor added on top of a modern army organisational structure, but this historical allegory helps give the military more legitimacy."

QIE_yan_xishan_idea_desc:0 "A republican warlord, few thought Yan Xishan would want to have anything to do with the new Qing state. Yet with Fengtian currently under the Japanese heel and the south engulfed in chaos, the Model Governor has decided to throw in his hat with the new constitutional system. Promoting aggressive industrial and political reform, Yan will most likely try and keep the Emperor a ceremonial figure."

QIE_social_democrat_party:0 "NCERA"
QIE_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Xin Zhonghua Diguo Gaige Xiehue (New Chinese Empire Reform Association)                                    §gThe NCERA, while using the name of a pre-Xinhai reformist group, is actually an alliance of two, more modern, reform groups. The first is the Rural Reconstruction Party (RRP), lead by Liang Shuming and the Harvard and Princeton educated J.C. 'Jimmy' Yen. Favouring rebuilding China from the ground-up, this group emphasises the value of the traditional Chinese village as the basic building block of society, rather than the warlords cliques that have dominated China for the last half-century. The second part of the coalition is a loose group of intellectuals inspired to the works of Kang Youwei, an ambitious reformer of the late Qing dynasty who advocated for a constitutional monarchy. Following the restoration of Puyi, his works have come back into prominence, and are popular among middle-class urban intellectuals. The NCERA want to see an end to warlords and foreign influence in China, and a return to a ‘traditional’ style of  decentralized local rule.§!"
QIE_social_liberal_party:0 "Young China Party"
QIE_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Qingnian Zhongguo Dang (Young China Party)      §gInspired by the Young Turks, the YCP is comprised of officers at Baoding Military Academy and urban intellectuals alienated by the exclusivity and nepotism of the Zhili clique. They advocate for the elimination of China's warlords and the establishment of a strong central government, as well as a nationalist agenda which focuses on the abolition of the special privileges and extraterritoriality enjoyed by foreign powers in China. They also wish to see the end of warlords and factionalism, and stress a return to a ‘legitimate’ government in China. While not necessarily in favour of Puyi and the Aisin Gioro clan, they also realize they are the best chance at achieving their dream.§!"
QIE_market_liberal_party:0 "Prosperity League"
QIE_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Fanrong Lianmeng (Prosperity League)                    §gThe PL is mainly the party of the new industrialist and banker class, who are suspicious of the HA’s corruption and inefficiency. Germany, also wary of Wu’s ambition but not wanting to revoke its support for the only bulwark of an unpopular regime, has focused on turning informal social clubs frequented by the new industrial upper class into an organised political party, facilitating connections between elites across the country through AoG organised 'progress expositions' that pushed a free-trade agenda as well as modern farming techniques and the newest technology.  While not overtly hostile to Wu’s ambitions, the PL mainly acts as a lobbying group, pushing for increased free trade, relaxed government regulations, and industrial stimulus - nominally for the interests of the elite - but truly for the Peking-Kommission. This is also the party favoured by German-trained officers in the fledgling Qing navy, whose inter-service rivalry with the Zhili-dominated military has been deliberately stoked by Germany.§!"

Opposed to Wu’s Zhili clique, they favour a return to Qing control over all of China. Unlike more radical factions, they are willing to tolerate warlords and some degree of factionalism - as long as they swear complete and utter loyalty to the Emperor. If in power, they would also allow elections, but in a German-style system where the Emperor would have ultimate say.§!"
QIE_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "Harmony Association"
QIE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Hexie Shetuan (Harmony Association)                     §gThe Harmony Association is a loose collection of Zhili bureaucrats, governors and hangers-on that represent Wu Peifu and Cao Kun's attempts to present a facade of democratic legitimacy in the Beijing Assembly. Officially they are a separate political party, completely divested from the military. Unofficially, however, most realize that the HA's sham democracy is little more than a half-hearted attempt to cover up the endemic corruption, inefficiency, and waste of the Zhili bureaucracy.§!"

### Events ###
qiedom.1.t:0 "The Great Qing"
qiedom.1.d:0 "The internationally mediated end of the last Zhili-Fengtian War in 1928 brought an end to nearly four years of chaos and instability, and the longest period of peace enjoyed by some parts of China since the Xinhai Rebellion of 1911. Though Wu Peifu and his Northern Zhili Clique accepted the return of Manchu monarchy, further German concessions were refused, leading to a cooling of relations. Germany continues to maintain support for the Qing Government, but mainly with the aim of ensuring consistent competition with the also-supported Southern Zhili as part of a larger divide and conquer strategy in China as a whole, as well as in the hopes of gradually building a Chinese bulwark against Japan.\n\nThough the spectre of Japanese domination looms across much of Northern and Eastern China, the country is nonetheless far more divided than most in Beijing would prefer, and Qing finds its authority contested on all sides, from the defiant Fengtian Government in the Northeast, to the various ostensible allies across the remainder of China; nominal components of the Empire granted near-total autonomy by grace of geography and regionalist sentiment. As a result, Qing enters 1936 largely contained to the North China Plain, and at the head of a faltering national order."
qiedom.1.a:0 "Long Live the Emperor!"

qiedom.2.t:0 "The Political Situation"
qiedom.2.d:0 "1936 finds the powerless Assembly on the brink. Five groups dominate the body, and although they have no power in the chamber, the groups that support them are not to be trifled with. The most powerful of these is the Harmony Association, nominally led by President Cao Kun. A depressed alcoholic, true power in the group resides with Wu Peifu, who founded the Association as a legitimising movement to ensure Zhili representation in the Assembly. While nominally an independent political party, the Harmony Association's deputies are all former Zhili officers, and following Cao Kun's legally dubious re-election few believe the group is anything more than a front for Wu to control the country.\n\nThe Prosperity League occupies a similar position, and while it claims to be a political party few see it as any more than a lobbying group for German interests in Beijing.\n\nThis leaves three parties in the opposition: The Manchu Party, comprised of Qing princes and former royal hangers-on, the Young China Party, a clique of young officers at the Baoding academy styling themselves after the Young Turk Party, and the New Chinese Empire Reformation Association, a fusion of two reform groups that, while loyal to the Emperor, favor a structural reorganisation of China back to the traditional model of the rural village, and the end to warlord cliques. While these three groups are in opposition to Wu, he allows them seats in the powerless assembly as a way to legitimise his unpopular regime."
qiedom.2.a:0 "Interesting"

qiedom.3.t:0 "Restructuring Our Debt"
qiedom.3.d:0 "For the last few years Wu and Cao have spent most of their political capital attempting to restructure and reduce the enormous debt of the Qing Empire. While theoretically possible, this plan has run into numerous challenges, the chief being a lack of support from the provincial governors. Rumours of instability in the south have further complicated these plans, and Cao Kun is expected to deliver a speech on reducing the national debt to the Assembly after the New Year Celebrations later this month."
qiedom.3.a:0 "We will await the speech..."

qiedom.4.t:0 "Death of Wang Chengbin"
qiedom.4.d:0 "Earlier this morning Wang Chengbin, a senior member of the Zhili clique and major ally of Cao Kun, passed away due to old age. While his death in and of itself is a blow to our command structure, it reveals a worrying trend. Many senior Zhili military officials are of old age, poor health, or both, and the corruption endemic in our military prevents younger officers from advancing through the ranks. Unless a serious effort is made, our high command will soon consist solely of doddering, senile old men terrified of adapting new technologies and doctrines."
qiedom.4.a:0 "What about age bringing wisdom?"

qiedom.5.t:0 "Ripples of Black Monday"
qiedom.5.d:0 "While in the weeks following Black Monday it appeared that we had escaped the worst of the damage, over the last few days German affiliated businesses have been hit with supply chain issues and increased prices. While the economic disruption is nowhere near the scale experienced in Europe and the Americas, this is still a blow to our economy."
qiedom.5.a:0 "Damn it!"

qiedom.13.t:0 "Election Results - Victory!"
qiedom.13.d:0 "Results are in from the parts of China still stable enough to hold elections. Turnout was (as expected) quite low, but in cities like Beijing we received record numbers of votes from intellectuals, reformers, and others previously opposed to our rule. It appears the intervention, while robbing us of German support, has given us a large deal of political legitimacy and support.\n\nIn the aftermath of the victory, president Cao Kun announced he was stepping down, to be replaced by Yan Huiqing. It unclear how much of an influence Wu Peifu had on this decision, but it is clear the Jade Marshal did not want any of Cao's drunken antics impacting the new government."
qiedom.13.a:0 "We didn't even have to rig this one!"

qiedom.14.t:0 "Meeting with the Manchu"
qiedom.14.d:0 "Following our attack on Anqing province nearly every delegate to the Assembly outside the Harmony League reacted by walking out of the Assembly. President Cao Kun has now been tasked with meeting with senior members of the Manchu party to ensure their continued loyalty following the speech.\n\n'You have to understand, sirs, that Japanese invasion is not a matter of if - it is a matter of when. Continued German support is required to ensure our national safety!'\n\nCao is initially successful at persuading many Manchu nobles but some of the younger hotshots like Gobulo Runqi react poorly to the President's overtures. Several hours of negotiation later, they agree on a 'noble pension', paid out to senior Manchu royalty with the express purpose of preserving 'Imperial culture'. It's little more than a bribe but it will keep the peace."
qiedom.14.a:0 "President Cao is no stranger to bribery..."

qiedom.15.t:0 "Meeting with the YCP"

Claiming that the intervention was 'capitulation to foreign interests', they were the first to storm out of the assembly chamber in protest. President Cao is now tasked with ensuring their loyalty.\n\nInitially, they stubbornly resist all attempts at negotiation, but eventually a deal is hammered out. They will continue their loyalty in exchange for increased military autonomy, and the end to supervision of the Baoding curriculum. This will hamper our efforts to ensure they stay loyal in the future, but we need their loyalty now."

President Cao is sceptical of their devotion to the reformist cause, but meets with Y. C. James Yen, one of the leaders. Yen is initially hesitant to compromise, but eventually they are able to reach a compromise.

Following the 4th Zhili-Fengtian War, we gained direct control of Eastern Shanxi, a slim area of land that used to belong to Yan Xishan’s Shanxi Clique. Our ownership of Eastern Shanxi has been the cause of tensions between us and the Shanxi Clique, but for now they are unable to compete with our military strength. Much like the rest of Shanxi, this area is rich with coal and iron. Multiple German companies took an interest in Eastern Shanxi, and so purchased the coal and iron mines there. These mines sit very close to the border with the Shanxi Clique, but this has not yet been a problem. \n\nHowever, news just came in that these Eastern Shanxi companies are going to increase their mining operations, and have presented plans that show some of their mines falling into Shanxi controlled territory. We personally do not need to worry about this, but it is likely to cause some problems in the Shanxi Clique, with many peasants feeling robbed that these German companies are taking their mines."

Even more heavily influenced by German economic support than we are, the League just finished construction on a major railroad, the Zhegan line. Though funded by the Germans, it was largely built by Chinese labour, leading many to hope for a more equitable relationship between German and Chinese in the League, at least in economic affairs.\n\nA few days ago, in a surprising move, the AOG publicly announced its plans to purchase and consolidate a number of eastern railways on behalf of their subsidiary group, the Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft - including this new Zhegan route.\n\nThis move angered many native Chinese residents of the League, who saw the Zhegan line as a potential building block in an equal relationship between Europeans and Asians. Widespread protests have broken out, inflamed by conspiracies of fraud and embezzlement on the part of Sun’s cronies."

To make matters worse, widespread boycotts of German goods have began in the South, and this morning reports reached Beijing of bombings of railway stations in Hangzhou and other cities on the Central China Railway. Transportation has ground to a halt in many regions of the League, and KMT guerillas have used this opportunity to stage increasingly daring attacks on isolated League garrisons.\n\nThe German ambassador is demanding accountability, and while the League is largely autonomous from our control we still need to do something. Jiang Baili and other Zhili officials have long pushed to exert greater control over the League, and are urging Wu to use this crisis to leverage greater control over the south. Wu is personally uncertain of this, but is currently drafting a telegram to demand accountability from Sun and offer our help should he need it. (Unsaid, of course, is the demand for increased control over League affairs should he accept our help.)"

Some claim German troops simply mowed down the protesters, while others claim a group of KMT radicals attacked the Germans and League troops first. Whatever the cause the city has fallen into anarchy, and protests have sprung up all over the League.\n\nIronically, at the same time as we received this information we received a report from Sun claiming he has the situation under control. Some Zhili generals are pushing for a major intervention in the south should the situation deteriorate further, but Wu has yet to take a clear position on the issue.\n\nFurther exasperating our problems, an informant we have placed within the NCERA claims they have somehow received information on the situation, and are planning to give a scathing speech later in the assembly today. HA officials are attempting to rouse Cao Kun from a drunken stupor and write a counterspeech, but we’ve been caught off guard."

Seeking to undercut their opportunity to invade, he declared a ‘national state of readiness’ this morning to all Zhili and Manchu generals, urging them to ready their troops for ‘any possible armed conflict’. Confused Zhili troops have largely fallen into line with Wu and any premature attack south was effectively ended before it began."

Just as he reaches his hand out to touch him, he is awoken by an alarmed official. ‘Apologies for waking you, Commissioner, but this is urgent!’ He hands Wu a telegram, before scuttling away. Blinking back sleep, Wu opens the telegram. Reading the characters, his hands start shaking. His worst nightmares have become reality.\n\n‘Sun shot yesterday PM STOP Perpetrator unclear STOP In coma STOP Unlikely to wake STOP Riots widespread STOP Fleeing with gold and documents STOP'\n\nTwo hours later Luoyang is a frenzied hub of activity. Documents concerning Sun’s more salacious dealings with Beijing burn in furnaces, while a group of senior Zhili officials confer with one another. In an unprecedented move Wu has invited several Manchu nobles, notably Pujie, to be present for the drafting of some form of unified statement in response to the assassination."

With the situation of League-Marshal Sun in Nanjing unclear, I have taken the responsibility of protecting the province of Anhui against bandits and leftist agitators.’\n\nA telegram was delivered to Wu Peifu this morning from the Anhui Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, of the Anqing Clique. While the tone of the letter was very bold, it appears Chen has restored order to the province. \n\nWu is faced with a choice - Chen would be a powerful ally, but he has a firm anti-concessions stance. Supporting him in the long-term would alienate Germany, whose support will be essential in the inevitable war against Japan. At the same time, taking a stance against Germany would undoubtedly endear Wu with the population."

Several of Wu's advisors are suggesting the Marshal reach out again to Chen with an offer of direct support in his rebellion, lest we end up with a Japanese lapdog right on our doorstep.\n\nBeyond just Japanese support for Chen, however, it also seems that non-intervention could lead to widespread domestic unrest. Many in both the opposition parties and the Zhili Clique itself are itching for an opportunity to extend our control in the chaos of the collapse, and already small protests in favour of Governor Chen's anti-concessions stance have broken out across urban areas.

Eventually, a group of men who had somehow armed themselves with stolen weapons began shooting at Xiao's troops, who responded by opening fire with machine-guns.

qiecoup.13.t:0 "A Plot is Uncovered!"
qiecoup.13.d:0 "A bizarre conspiracy has been revealed to Wu Peifu! Apparently a group of disgruntled Manchu princes, reformers, and Zhili generals have been clandestinely plotting to overthrow the Zhili clique and restore Puyi to a position of power! A member of this plot grew disgruntled once their foreign backer reneged his support, and instead came to Wu, betraying his erstwhile allies.\n\nWu has already dispatched police to raid the safehouses where the plotters have been meeting, and arrested a confused Puyi, who was apparently unaware of any plot in the first place! President Cao Kun went before a stunned assembly where he announced the charges, before announcing his resignation in shame for failing to discover the plot. With the end of the Qing dynasty, Marshal Wu Peifu will act as a temporary "National Protector" until a new government can be assembled."

qiecoup.14.t:0 "Purging Traitors"
qiecoup.14.d:0 "With the Manchu removed as a political force, the question now remains what to be done with the Manchu generals in our military. The obvious answer is imprisoning them, but then then what about all the Zhili generals that sided with them? Several are quite skilled, and removing them from our officer pool would have consequences. Still, it would ensure loyalty going forward."

When asked where they received this from, none were able to give a straight answer, with most saying it just appeared overnight.\n\nEven more worrying, several Zhili generals have dropped out of contact with Luoyang over the last few hours, notably including Li Bingzhi, whose monarchist sympathies are well-known. Even worse, Baoding military academy appears to have been abandoned overnight, and communications with far-flung parts of the empire have been interrupted due to widespread radio and telephone outages."

qiecoup.19.t:0 "A Summons to Beijing"
qiecoup.19.d:0 "While Wu is attempting to process the alarming developments that have occurred over the last few days, an urgent telegram arrived from Beijing. Cao Kun and Wu have been summoned to a meeting with the Emperor over the state of the country. Widespread riots are still a daily occurrence, and while the Emperor technically has the constitutional prerogative to summon his President, this has never occurred. While Wu may sense a trap, Cao Kun has already informed the Emperor that himself and Wu will present themselves to His Imperial Majesty later that week."

qiecoup.20.t:0 "Wu and Cao Prepare to Meet Puyi"
qiecoup.20.d:0 "After arriving from Luoyang, Wu berated Cao for essentially inviting them into a trap. Still, the Jade Marshal is not one to go into a meeting like this without a trump card up his sleeve. As the two men prepare to enter the hall, Wu orders his bodyguards to wait outside the entrance to the chambers. The ceremonial bodyguards outside are unarmed except for traditional swords, and the Zhili soldiers have hidden pistols within their pockets..."
qiecoup.20.a:0 "They enter the hall..."

qiecoup.21.t:0 "Guards Rush into the Hall!"
qiecoup.21.d:0 "As the two men enter and kneel before the emperor, around a dozen heavily armed Manchu guards rush into the room! Surrounding the emperor, they move forward and attempt to arrest the two men, while Puyi flees the room! Upon hearing the commotion, Wu’s bodyguards outside quickly dispatch the ceremonial guards and rush in, while Wu and Cao duck behind pillars to avoid getting hit. Bullets fly back and forth among the ancient pillars of the hall, smashing priceless artefacts and wounding Cao Kun. When the bullets stop, however, one side emerges victorious."
qiecoup.21.a:0 "Wu and Cao are killed! The coup succeeds!"
qiecoup.21.b:0 "The Manchu bodyguards lie dead on the ground!"

qiecoup.22.t:0 "The Emperor Asserts Himself"
qiecoup.22.d:0 "Puyi nervously re-enters the room, gazing down at the bullet-riddled bodies of the former Jade Marshal and his mentor, President Cao Kun. Pujie and another small group of Manchu guardsmen enter as well, all carrying submachine guns. ‘Dearest brother - I believe it’s time for you to make a speech.’ Puyi turns from the corpses and looks at Pujie. ‘I-’ he begins, his voice uncertain. ‘I am not sure if I can do that.’ Pujie is about to say something when General Li Bingzhi, the leader of the Zhili deserters, bursts into the room.\n\n'My lord! The city is secure!’ He says, kowtowing almost to the ground facing Puyi. ‘But Jiang Baili and several other Zhili generals have retreated to Luoyang! They are planning to launch a campaign to destroy us and liberate Beijing!’ Pujie moves over to Puyi, and whispers in his ear. ‘You are the Emperor now - you must act like one!’ Puyi nervously attempts to gather himself. ‘I - the Xuantong Emperor, Son of Heaven, formally proclaim any members of the Zhili clique who do not swear fealty to me by tomorrow no-’ His voice cracks, and he is forced to steady himself. ‘Who do not do so by tomorrow noon to be traitors to the Great Qing!’"
qiecoup.22.a:0 "Death to Traitors!"

qiecoup.23.t:0 "Honouring Our Obligation"
qiecoup.23.d:0 "We have received word from Beijing that the coup plan has gone off without a hitch! Wu Peifu and Cao Kun were killed in a shootout in the Forbidden City, and Manchu generals and some Zhili who deserted are mobilizing their forces to destroy those loyal to the old regime. It’s time to honour our obligation to the Emperor and destroy these traitors!"
qiecoup.23.a:0 "Destroy the traitors!"

qiecoup.24.t:0 "The Countercoup"
qiecoup.24.d:0 "Following Cao and Wu’s narrow escape from death in the Throne Room, Wu’s bodyguards dispersed throughout the palace, gunshots echoing throughout the halls as they encounter sporadic Manchu resistance. A few minutes later, they burst back into the throne room, dragging a terrified Puyi with them. Wu, standing above the prostrated Puyi, gestures to a bodyguard. Drawing a pistol, he grabs Puyi behind him and leads him to the door. Outside, a small group of courtiers and hangers on have gathered, along with the Emperor’s brother, Pujie, and several other Manchu nobles. Opening the door to the audience chamber, Wu steps forward, flanked by the Emperor and his captor.\n\n’Your plot has failed, traitors.’ He twists his mouth into a smirk, before gesturing the bodyguard to pull the emperor back into the room. ‘One step forward - and the Son of Heaven dies.’\n\nSecretly, Wu is terrified. But this will not be the first time he has cheated death. ‘You will all enter the throne room, where my guards will ensure you are watched over well. President Cao!’ he turns to the head of the Assembly, who at this point has retreated into the room himself. ‘Take some guards and get over to the Assembly chamber as fast as you can!’ He glances back at Puyi. ‘The time has come to end the Empire. China shall be a Republic once more.’\n\nA few hours later, once Zhili troops have raided the plotting rooms, documents are found implicating neighbouring warlords. Wu is quick to immediately declare them traitors, and mobilize his troops for war."
qiecoup.24.a:0 "Death to Traitors!"

qiecoup.25.t:0 "Victory!"
qiecoup.25.d:0 "Reports have returned to the Imperial Palace that our troops have reached the Yellow River. The scattered Zhili garrisons around Beijing proved to be little match for the Baoding-led armies, and General Zaitao's Manchu assisted in harrying retreating Zhili troops as they attempted to flee to Luoyang. Many troops simply deserted to our forces, as the thought of serving a leaderless army with little concentrated political backing does not really appeal.\n\nOur forces are now ready to began an assault on Luoyang, Wu Peifu's stronghold, currently being defended by forces under general Jiang Baili, Wu's second in command. Securing this fortress will be the beginning of the end for the Zhili clique."
qiecoup.25.a:0 "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

qiecoup.26.t:0 "Victory in Luoyang!"
qiecoup.26.d:0 "A telegram arrived this morning from Luoyang, confirming that our troops were victorious in storming the walls of the fortified city. Following hours of concentrated artillery bombardment, loyal troops crossed the river in impromptu barges, sustaining heavy fire. Once ashore, however, they quickly secured control over a beachhead, allowing more and more of our troops to land and begin attacking Zhili units garrisoned in the city. Fighting among the ancient grotto and temples that dot the city, our troops eventually stormed the Zhili headquarters, killing Jiang Baili. Other generals managed to escape, and Zhili troops have scattered throughout the surrounding countryside looting and pillaging even as they flee our forces."
qiecoup.26.a:0 "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

qiecoup.27.t:0 "Victory in the South!"
qiecoup.27.d:0 "The last few weeks have seen intense fighting across the southern reaches of our territory, as the die-hard supporters of Wu Peifu and the Zhili Clique were hunted down and destroyed. Especially viscous was the fighting on all routes leading in to Wuhan, as the last remnants of the Zhili Command prepare to organise a desperate last-stand in the ancient city. With the isolated garrisons destroyed, we can turn our eyes on securing this city and destroying the Zhili once and for all."
qiecoup.27.a:0 "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

qiecoup.28.t:0 "Victory in Wuchang!"
qiecoup.28.d:0 "In a final all-out assault our forces, bolstered by ranks of Zhili deserters, finally stormed Wuhan, destroying the remaining Zhili forces and capturing or killing many senior Zhili generals. With victory finally secured, we can now start to focus on rebuilding our country, and rearing it from both the ravages of the conflict we just endured and the decades of rampant corruption we were subjected to under the Zhili."
qiecoup.28.a:0 "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

qiecoup.29.t:0 "Prosperity League Dissolves!"
qiecoup.29.d:0 "Following our recent upheavals, the Prosperity League has abruptly dissolved, citing a 'hostile atmosphere', with many of their prominent lobbyists leaving for Tianjin. While the German legation remains in Beijing, they have cut themselves off from any government contact, robbing us of German military and industrial support. The people, however are overwhelmingly in favour of this move, and are praising the new government for ridding itself of foreign influences."
qiecoup.29.a:0 "We don't need them!"

qiecoup.30.t:0 "Sending aid to the Qing?"
qiecoup.30.d:0 "Now that we have helped the Qing overthrow the despotic Wu Peifu, should we aid them in their campaign to destroy the Zhili remnants?"

qiecoup.30.b:0 "No."

qiecoup.31.t:0 "Our Allies Send Aid!"

qiecoup.31.a:0 "Thank you!"

qiecoup.32.t:0 "A Request to Baron Sternberg"
qiecoup.32.d:0 "An unusual letter has arrived from a courier wearing Imperial robes this morning. Claiming to be a minor noble, this young man brings astonishing news. A group of Manchu princes, reformers, and disgruntled military officials are secretly plotting to overthrow Marshal Wu Peifu and restore Emperor Puyi! They are apparently seeking external aid and have come to the Baron for help. How do we respond?"
qiecoup.32.a:0 "Of course! For the glory of the Qing!"
qiecoup.32.b:0 "Refuse. This is too risky."

qiefocus.1.t:0 "Chinese New Year: Rat"
qiefocus.1.d:0 "In a long, somewhat rambling speech to mark the Chinese New Year, Assembly President Cao Kun addressed the need to restore the glory of the Qing Empire, unite the country, and repay the debt burdening the economy. He laid out a three point plan: Government subsidies and tax cuts would be given to light manufacturing industries, farmers would be granted tax cuts to grow edible plants instead of cash crops, and an increased tax on provincial governors."  
qiefocus.1.a:0 "The speech is met with polite applause"

qiefocus.2.t:0 "Emergency Meeting of the Zhili"
qiefocus.2.d:0 "Following the collapse of the League to the south we have gathered nearly all senior Zhili-aligned military officers in Luoyang. As the meeting starts, Marshal Wu Peifu opens with a short statement.\n\n'Fellow soldiers - the time has come. With the collapse of the League we are - for the first time since the Zhifeng war - in a precarious situation. Every choice we make over the next few weeks will determine the outcome of China for decades to come.'\n\n'I would like to remind some' he says, glancing at the more hawkish members of the assembly 'that intervention is not necessarily the most sound course of action. We need to weigh our options first before committing.'\n\nThe various generals nod in agreement, and begin a series of discussions on the best course of action."
qiefocus.2.a:0 "We need to be careful..."

qiefocus.3.t:0 "New Elections"
qiefocus.3.d:0 "Our decision to support the Anqing government has been met with great support and approval from the population. In response, Marshal Wu has 'persuaded' Assembly President Cao Kun to declare a national election to capitalize on our new support. Theoretically all literate men in China are eligible to participate, but local warlords, widespread chaos in the League, and other issues means that we only expect results from areas under our direct control. Previous elections have seen razor-thin margins, and while the body is largely powerless a buffer in the number of seats under our control will bolster our legitimacy in the long run."
qiefocus.3.a:0 "Schedule the elections"

qiefocus.4.t:0 "Drafting a New Constitution"
qiefocus.4.d:0 "Following the overthrow of the Qing Empire, Wu Peifu assembled a group of constitutional and legal scholars to help him create a new government for China. Holding the city of Beijing gave him some level of legitimacy, and the military power he possesses gives any document he chooses to adopt force behind it.\n\nWith the question of legitimacy solved, the pressing question Wu has to answer is the form of the constitution. In order to save time and expedite the centralization of China, he could simply adopt the last non-monarchist constitution of China, the 1923 one created by President Cao Kun. This, however, is rife with loopholes, opportunities for executive abuse, and other problems. Wu and the scholars he has assembled could draft their own constitution, though this would take time and political capital."
qiefocus.4.a:0 "Re-adopt Cao Kun's old constitution"
qiefocus.4.b:0 "Draft a new constitution"

qiefocus.5.t:0 "Power of the Executive"
qiefocus.5.d:0 "The first issue confronting Wu's constitutional scholars is the level of power the executive should possess. It is unsaid, of course, that Wu and the Zhili clique will guide the executive through these trying times, but once China is unified there is a general understanding that Wu's government will (gradually) transition into some form of democracy.\n\nWith that being said, a strong executive guarantees stability, while an empowered legislative body is better at generating political capital and clout."
qiefocus.5.a:0 "Ensure the executive has strong authority"
qiefocus.5.b:0 "Ensure the legislature has strong authority"

qiefocus.6.t:0 "The Issue of Autonomy"
qiefocus.6.d:0 "The next issue facing Wu's constitutional assembly is the level of autonomy for the provinces. Previous republican governments often came into conflict with the provincial administrations, and this - in part - lead to the current situation in China. Strong centralization, on the other hand, ensures that orders issued by Beijing are followed better."
qiefocus.6.a:0 "Allow the provinces some autonomy"
qiefocus.6.b:0 "Keep it centralized"

qiefocus.7.t:0 "Drafting Is Complete!"
qiefocus.7.d:0 "After many hours spent hunched over desks writing and arguing over the minutia of constitutional law, we have a new constitution! Wu and the Zhili clique, will ensure that the new government is stable for the first few years of its existence, but once China is reunified many scholars are hopeful China can begin a transition into a real democracy."
qiefocus.7.a:0 "Now all we need is a president!"

qiefocus.8.t:0 "Selecting a President"
qiefocus.8.d:0 "Despite being one of the foremost military minds in China, Wu Peifu's skills are not well-suited to the halls of government. Already, he fears military matters are falling to the wayside due to his duties as 'National Protector', and has ordered that the scholars drafting the constitution come up with a list of potential new presidents for the Republic. Two candidates have emerged: Scholar and intellectual Hu Shih, and diplomat and (briefly) former president V. K. Wellington Ku (Gu Weijun).\n\nHu is well-known for his theory of 'pragmatism' (shíyànzhuyì), a concept first originating in the United States in the 1870s and 80s. In Hu's writings, he advocates for cooperation with warlords and working to change the Chinese government from the inside-out, instead of ripping it down and rebuilding it like many in the KMT. Following the failure of the Northern Expedition this theory has gained many adherents, and is quite popular in academic circles.\n\nWellington Koo, on the other hand, is a diplomatic genius and politician, who attended the Versailles conference in 1920 as an observer, and helped negotiate several deals with American, German, and British diplomats, giving him a dearth of diplomatic experience that will no doubt be useful in legitimising our government."
qiefocus.8.a:0 "Wu selects Hu Shih"
qiefocus.8.b:0 "Wu selects Wellington Koo"

qiefocus.9.t:0 "Inaugurating the New Republic"
qiefocus.9.d:0 "In an elaborate ceremony today, Wu Peifu oversaw the swearing in of the new President of the Republic to adoring cheers. The assembly remains firmly in control of the Harmony Association, and many still question the legitimacy of this new regime. Still, Wu no longer has to contend with the Manchu as a potential opponent, and can instead concentrate on fixing the massive debt issues facing China, and starting to re-unify the fractured country.\n\nAdditionally, despite our best efforts to present our government as the legitimate government of China, few see us that way. We will need to either destroy or coerce the groups that oppose our regime, and convince the general population we are the true government of China!"
qiefocus.9.a:0 "Congratulations, Mr. President!"

qiefocus.10.t:0 "Debt and Legitimacy"
qiefocus.10.d:0 "The debt issue continues to interfere with our economic efforts, and impedes our attempts to reinforce the legitimacy of our new government. While we could ask Germany for support, it is likely that this will cause our already unpopular government to collapse under public pressure. The much more shrewd plan is to take an anti-concession stance, defaulting on our debt but earning us the loyalty of our population."
qiefocus.10.a:0 "Default. It's the only choice."

qiefocus.11.t:0 "The Future of the Zhili Clique"
qiefocus.11.d:0 "The Zhili clique, like every other warlord clique in China, operates primarily on a basis of seniority and on mentor-mentee relationships. This, while (usually) providing stability and helping reduce the probability for back-stabbing, also stifles meritocracy and promotions based on skill. With the recent deaths and advancing age of many senior generals, however, we may be forced to take drastic action, and promote younger officers to the forefront of our military.\n\nFour candidates have emerged for elevation to the full general corps: Guo Jijioa, Wang Lingyun, Du Xijun and Wei Yisan."
qiefocus.11.a:0 "Promote these promising young men! Now to start our defence plan."

qiefocus.12.t:0 "A Defence Plan for China"
qiefocus.12.d:0 "Following Wu Peifu’s call for a meeting of senior Zhili generals, a large number have arrived in Luoyang, leaving their subordinates in charge of front-line duties. The first pressing concern is picking a centralized defence strategy for the inevitable war with Japan and the Fengtian government. The northern traitor’s growing boldness in the wake of the League collapse has alarmed many senior commanders, including Jiang Baili and Liu Menggeng. The two men have spent the last few weeks codifying plans they have been developing over the last two years and have presented them to the assembled Zhili commanders. Jiang’s focuses on large-scale defensive fortifications, moving industry to the interior of China, and rousing the ‘fighting spirit’ of China in order to defeat Japan.\n\nWhile not a direct opposite to Jiang’s plan, Liu’s plan focuses more on improving the fighting capability of Zhili troops. Improved morale, drill standards, and logistical support are key, at least in his eyes, of ensuring Chinese victory. Updated medical care also plays a crucial part of the strategy. Both are compelling plans, but it is up to Wu Peifu to ultimately decide."
qiefocus.12.a:0 "Pick Jiang Baili's plan"
qiefocus.12.b:0 "Pick Liu Menggeng's plan"

qiefocus.13.t:0 "Financial Proposal"

qiefocus.13.a:0 "Meet the bankers."

qiefocus.14.t:0 "Rebuilding our Command Structure"
qiefocus.14.d:0 "Following the purge of many senior members of the Zhili Clique, our army has been left without much of a command structure. It has fallen on Li Bingzhi, one of the few Zhili deserters, and two Aisin-Gioro princes, Zaitao and the Emperor’s brother Pujie, to reform the Imperial command structure. This will not be an easy task, as Wu and his cronies essentially did away with a modern divisional structure based on meritocratic promotion in favour of cronyism and nepotism. While their reforms will take time to implement, they have decided to fill out the thin roster of senior commanders with Fang Zhijian and Liang Bin, two young Baoding cadets who helped overthrow the Zhili. Though inexperienced, with any luck they will learn quickly."
qiefocus.14.a:0 "Excellent"

qiefocus.15.t:0 "Assessing Doctrine"
qiefocus.15.d:0 "The next major issue facing the military rebuilders is the issue of doctrine. The Zhili were hesitant to innovate, instead relying on old, but well-tried and tested doctrine. As China modernises, however, we may be forced to fundamentally shift our doctrine. Which direction should we take our forces in?"
qiefocus.15.a:0 "Artillery decided many of the battles of the Warlord Era."
qiefocus.15.b:0 "We have many devoted subjects ready to throw down their lives for the Emperor..."
qiefocus.15.c:0 "Grand battleplans are the way to winning the coming war."

qiefocus.16.t:0 "The Uneasy Coalition"
qiefocus.16.d:0 "While all of the reformist parties were formally united in their desire to overthrow the Zhili, now that the dust has settled following the coup they find themselves in an uneasy position. Japan and the Fengtian loom large, and they must work together in order to avoid annihilation. Yet at the same time the different reform groups have differing goals and objectives, and varying things they can contribute to the military. Puyi and his advisors need the support of each of the parties and their military wings to win the eventual war with Japan, but doing so will come at a cost..."
qiefocus.16.a:0 "At least this is better than the Zhili."

qiefocus.17.t:0 "The Yellow Sand Society"
qiefocus.17.d:0 "Beyond the Rural Defence Forces employed by the NCERA, the Yellow Sands Society, an esoteric sect with connections to the Yiguandao, have offered to join our army. They are fierce fighters, and relatively loyal given our new anti-concession stance, but some fear accepting their offer to join our army will allow the Yiguandao another opportunity to infiltrate as well."
qiefocus.17.a:0 "Offer them a place in the army."
qiefocus.17.b:0 "No, this is too risky."

qiefocus.18.d.zhang:0 "Now that their rule over Beijing is secure, Aisin-Gioro Puyi and his advisors have begun assembling an emergency government to rule China until the country is stable enough for elections to be held. Of the three groups that helped overthrow the Zhili, each have an ambitious reform agenda, and dedicated support from specific groups of the population. Complicating matters, however, is the fact that Zhang Tianran is pushing for the NCERA to be picked, owing to their rural reform agenda.

qiefocus.22.t:0 "A New Coronation?"
qiefocus.22.d:0 "An unusual idea has been circulating among Manchu nobles over the last few weeks - organising a second coronation for Puyi. They claim that since the Restoration of 1927 was carried out under the supervision of the Zhili clique it was not really ‘proper’ and that a new reinstating ceremony must be carried out in order to appease the traditions of the empire. The cost for this would be staggeringly high, but it may give us some legitimacy, and will earn us further support from the nobles."

qiefocus.23.d:0 "Over the last few days the Marquis of Extended Grace, Duke Minsheng, and other various descendants of old Imperial dynasties have arrived in Beijing. One by one they file past the Emperor, silently bowing to pay their respects. In a novel first, a court photographer has been tasked with capturing each of these submissions, and they will be distributed as propaganda to both prove the legitimacy of the Emperor, and erode any support for a non-Manchu ruling family."

qiefocus.24.d:0 "Ever since the coup that toppled the Zhili Clique, the future of our government remained uncertain. Now, however, the warlord that helped overthrow Wu is set to depart for Beijing, where we expect much of their agenda to be revealed..."

qiefocus.25.d:0 "Following our victory over Fengtian and the Japanese, senior Zhili diplomats are now considering the best course of action in regards to our continued relationship with [GER.GetName]. The idea of joining the Reichspakt was discussed, but most of our high command remains opposed to the idea of foreign entanglements. We might still be able to negotiate a treaty of cooperation, however. And others say we should focus inward on developing our war-ravaged nation."
qiefocus.25.a:0 "Request a guarantee of independence."
qiefocus.25.b:0 "Focus on developing China instead."
qiefocus.25.c:0 "The High Command be damned! We shall join the Reichspact if they like it or not!"

qiefocus.26.t:0 "A Request from Beijing"
qiefocus.26.d:0 "The ambassador from the Qing Empire has formally requested to join the Reichspakt. This is an interesting opportunity - they could be a powerful ally in the East, having already bested the Fengtian Government and the Japanese Empire. At the same time though, they could drag us into wars far from home we care little about."
qiefocus.26.a:0 "Grant them entry."
qiefocus.26.b:0 "Refuse. They are a liability."

qiefocus.27.t:0 "A Request from Beijing"
qiefocus.27.d:0 "The ambassador from the Qing Empire has formally requested a guarantee of independence from us. This is an interesting opportunity - they were instrumental in defeating Japan, and this would not be binding for any of their aggressive wars."
qiefocus.27.a:0 "Sign the guarantee."
qiefocus.27.b:0 "Refuse. They are a liability."

qiefocus.28.t:0 "Reorganisation of Warlord Divisions"
qiefocus.28.d:0 "Many Zhili warlords posses personal armies that they use to guard the provinces they govern. The fighting capabilities of these troops, however, are sub-par at best. They lack standardization and are more used to shaking down peasant farmers for cash than fighting pitched battles. Wu Peifu, as part of the overall plan to prepare the Zhili military for the inevitable conflict with Japan, has proposed reorganising retraining these personal divisions along the national division standards. This plan has met with considerable opposition from Zhili generals, but we can overrule their concerns with significant political capital.\n\nIf we proceed with the reorganisation, the new divisions should be ready in four months. If not, we can reorganise them at our own leisure, but it will be difficult to procure enough equipment."
qiefocus.28.a:0 "Begin the reorganisation."
qiefocus.28.b:0 "We have better things to worry about."

qiefocus.29.t:0 "Reorganised Divisions Complete Training"
qiefocus.29.d:0 "The private militias, with considerable effort and training, have finished their reorganisation, and are now equipped with the best supplies we have. This should significantly help us in our fight against Japan."

Governor Yan Xishan has asked for our assistance in defeating the [QIE.GetNameDef], but we cannot simply pivot to attacking them. Many of our generals fear our forces are unready for such a large conflict, and our Japanese backers have not yet signed off on such a quick attack. We can either override these generals at the cost of some political power, or wait the three months they say they need to prep their troops, and inform Yan we will assist then.\n\nOf course, we could also refuse to get involved at all."
qiefor.19.d_postcoup:0 "While reports are unclear of how exactly this occurred, it appears that Yan Xishan, governor of Shanxi and our former ally, was somehow involved in a coup attempt against the Zhili. We don't know the exact details, but the coup appears to have failed and now Zhili forces are mustering to attack Shanxi. While we want to defend our former ally, our forces have been caught off-guard. We can intervene immediately, though overruling our top generals will cost significant political power. Or, however, we can wait a few months to prepare our forces adequately, and hope that Governor Yan can hold on for that long.\n\nOf course, we could also refuse to get involved at all."

qiefor.24.t:0 "Rich Vein Discovered!"
qiefor.24.d:0 "Following our recent focus on mining in the Shanxi region we have uncovered vast deposits of mineral wealth. It is truly fortuitous we seized this area from Governor Yan during the last Zhifeng war! Our engineers have just discovered a new vein full of coal and iron ore. The only problem, however, is that it extends underground into Yan's territory. While we could mine this, Yan's engineers will no doubt notice the incursion.\n\nEver since the League Collapse Yan has drawn closer and closer to Zhang Zuolin in Fengtian, who he was formerly allied with. Wu's advisers are warning him that this could very well escalate tensions between us and the Fengtian government."

qiefor.26.t:0 "[SHX.GetName] Protests our Miners!"
qiefor.26.d:0 "Governor Yan Xishan has lodged a formal protest with the Bureau of Mines, claiming that our miners have violated his provinces' boundaries. Normally, we would simply ignore this, but Yan has also noted that should Beijing fail to act accordingly, he will seek out 'responsible government to address the problem' - a reference many are interpreting to mean [FNG.GetLeader] in Fengtian."
qiefor.26.a:0 "Who cares? Keep mining!"

qiefor.27.t:0 "[QIE.GetName] Ignored Us!"

qiefor.28.a:0 "Great!"

qiefor.29.t:0 "Shanxi Back Down!"
qiefor.29.d:0 "Shanxi has backed down, letting our miners access the veins! This is a great victory, as our war machine can use these materials to gear up for the eventual conflict with Japan."

qiefor.30.d2:0 "Mining disputes on the Shanxi-[QIE.GetName] border have escalated over the last few months, and now Governor [SHX.GetLeader] is asking us to step in and guarantee his provincial borders. He was a staunch ally of ours during the last Zhi-Feng war, and his province controls valuable mineral resources we could use. However, we have already decided upon a strategy to combat the [QIE.GetName] together with Anqing. Going back on that might make them decide to not join our war."

qiefor.32.d:0 "It appears that Yan was serious in his threat to reach out to the Fengtian - [FNG.GetLeader] has just announced he will protect the 'provincial integrity' of Shanxi against any 'rebel incursions'. This is a betrayal of the highest order and another sign that our national order has crumbled. We can either attempt to call Yan and Zhang's bluff if we feel strong enough, or back down, though that will cost us prestige."

qiefor.34.t:0 "Skirmishes on Shanxi-[QIE.GetName] Border!"

qiefor.35.a:0 "Ready the troops!"

qiefor.36.t:0 "The [FNG.GetName] Back Down!"
qiefor.36.d:0 "Our plan to call [FNG.GetLeader]'s bluff has succeeded!

qiefor.38.t:0 "The Manchu Demand We Submit!"
qiefor.38.d:0 "It appears our attempts at isolation and rebuilding are in vain. The new Manchu government in Beijing are demanding we officially recognize their authority and submit to their rule.

qiefor.57.d:0 "Following a suggestion by one of our officials of the China Council in the Anqing Clique, work has begun on developing the Wuchang-Anqing region, which serves as the interior of both our nations. Previous development and cooperation has usually revolved around the Beijing-Nanjing axis, but it is good that there is now also progress on developing other areas."
qiefor.57.a:0 "Let them do most of the work"
qiefor.57.b:0 "Invest ourselves"

qiefor.58.t:0 "New Offices Beijing Liaison Council"
qiefor.58.d:0 "The Anqing Clique has emerged victorious with our support. We recently installed the Beijing Liaison Council as our official representative organisation in the new Anqing capital of Nanjing. They will be working towards achieving eventual unification. However, they have now requested that in order to make a statement and show the glory of the Emperor to the Chinese commoners in Nanjing, we should fund the construction of very large offices for them."
qiefor.58.a:0 "No, not worth it"
qiefor.58.b:0 "Fund construction"

qiefor.59.t:0 "Resource Development with Anqing"
qiefor.59.d:0 "We have recently struck a deal with Anqing to stimulate Qing enterprises to aid in the prospecting and development of resources in their territory. Now, we of course indirectly benefit from these resources as we can trade with Anqing, but shouldn't we get some direct benefits as well? We could ask for control over one of their iron mines in Wuhu. Maybe they will be willing to accommodate us."
qiefor.59.a:0 "No, it doesn't cost us anything"
qiefor.59.b:0 "Yes, ask them for steel from Wuhu"

qiefor.60.t:0 "Anqing Refuses Special Treatment"
qiefor.60.d:0 "The Beijing Liaison Council has been hard at work to improve the ability of Qing enterprises to do business in the Anqing Clique. Due to the backwards nature and governance of the Anqing Clique, this is sometimes quite difficult. However,when recently the Liaison Council requested the Anqing Clique to do something about this, they outright refused! This is unacceptable. We should send them another offer. One they can't refuse."
qiefor.60.a:0 "Send the offer"

qiefor.61.t:0 "Anqing Still Refuses"
qiefor.61.d:0 "Somehow, they refused an offer they weren't supposed to refuse. As a result, through coordination with the Beijing Liaison Council, we have temporarily implemented extremely far-reaching restrictions for Anqing companies operating within our borders. While we will make sure our own economy is not hit, we will prevent any kind of profit flowing to Anqing for at least the next few months. This will surely make them unhappy, but it should teach them for next time."
qiefor.61.a:0 "Do it"

qiefor.62.t:0 "Puyi Receives Warm Welcome in Nanjing"
qiefor.62.d:0 "Emperor Puyi recently visited the Southern Capital, Nanjing, together with Wu Peifu. There they met with Chen Tiaoyuan, who made sure that he received an incredibly warm welcome. That is most definitely an excellent sign of things to come. In fact, Puyi has been so delighted that he has asked Chen Tiaoyuan if an extensive imperial palace could be constructed in Nanjing."
qiefor.62.a:0 "Excellent"

qiefor.63.t:0 "Puyi Shocked by Protests in Nanjing"
qiefor.63.d:0 "Emperor Puyi recently visited the Southern Capital, Nanjing, together with Wu Peifu. There they met with Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique. However, to both the Emperor's and Wu's dismay, the streets were littered by protests. It was obvious that either Chen did not have things under control or he simply didn't care to provide a proper welcome for Puyi. Both scenarios are scandalous and require correction. The Beijing Liaison Council has received orders to make sure that Chen pays for this."
qiefor.63.a:0 "Bad manners"

qiefor.64.t:0 "Chen Agrees with Intellectuals"
qiefor.64.d:0 "The intellectual gathering organised by the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing was a great success. Such a success even, that Chen Tiaoyuan himself announced that he agrees with their sentiment and will do all he can to accelerate the timeline. Hopefully he isn't lying."
qiefor.64.a:0 "Good news"

qiefor.65.t:0 "Chen Stresses His Autonomy"
qiefor.65.d:0 "Recently, the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing organised a meeting of various famous Chinese intellectuals. They all came to the same conclusion: China must unite immediately. However, Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of Anqing, has spoken out against the urgency of their call. Instead, he says that local autonomy is more important than unification. What he says is practically a renunciation of his recognition of the Qing as sole national government! We cannot let him get away with such words and must speak against it immediately."
qiefor.65.a:0 "Prepare a counter-message"

qiefor.66.t:0 "The Qing Reach Out"
qiefor.66.d:0 "Tensions are mounting in the north, with Qing afraid that it might be attacked by Fengtian, or even Japan. They are looking for allies and as we have not forgotten their help in the League war, have now come to us. Will we accept their request and enter into an alliance with them?"
qiefor.66.a:0 "Of course"
qiefor.66.b:0 "No!"

qiefor.67.t:0 "The Qing Reach Out"
qiefor.67.d:0 "Now that Qing is under attack from the outside, they have requested us to enter into an alliance with them and participate in the defense of China. If we don't help, China might get overrun. We really have no choice."
qiefor.67.a:0 "Of course"
qiefor.67.b:0 "No!"

qiefor.68.t:0 "The Qing Reach Out"
qiefor.68.d:0 "So far, we have evaded being integrated by Qing. However, now they have emerged victorious in their other major conflict, meaning that we are most likely next."
qiefor.68.a:0 "Of course"
qiefor.68.b:0 "No!"

qiefor.69.t:0 "Chen Refuses Alliance"
qiefor.69.d1:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This is hard to believe, but true. There is little we can do now, as we do not wish to blow up our relationship, but we will make sure he accepts next time."
qiefor.69.d2:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This is hard to believe, but true. There is little we can do now, as we are at war, but we will make he bends the knee after we have emerged victorious."
qiefor.69.d3:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This even after we have defeated China's greatest enemy and shown that we are the rightful government! We cannot show any weakness."
qiefor.69.a:0 "He will pay for this"

qiefor.70.t:0 "Anqing Canal Cooperation"
qiefor.70.d:0 "The Beijing Liaison Council has again been successful. It noticed that Anqing had recently completed significant dike and canal work, including the completion of the massive Subei Canal. It was then able to secure Anqing cooperation in dike works in Hebei and Kaifeng. Work can begin as soon as we want."
qiefor.70.a:0 "Excellent"

qiefor.71.t:0 "Army Cooperation with Anqing"
qiefor.71.d:0 "Anqing are now part of our alliance and the next obvious step was closer army cooperation. They have now taken that step and the Beijing Liaison Council has set up the Army Cooperation Commission. Now, it is up to us if we want to expend resources to improve the Anqing armies, as they are quite outdated and based very much on age-old warlord tactics. The benefits are clear, as not only would it improve their fighting capabilities in war, it would also afford us valuable influence over them."
qiefor.71.a:0 "We'll help them"
qiefor.71.b:0 "They'll have to manage on their own"

qiefor.72.t:0 "Anqing Refuses Further Army Cooperation"
qiefor.72.d:0 "Unfortunately, Anqing has refused further army cooperation for now. However, they must eventually realize that this cooperation is critical if a strong defence is to be mounted against our common enemies. We can try again in the future."
qiefor.72.a:0 "Alright"

qiefor.73.t:0 "Army Cooperation Concluded"
qiefor.73.d:0 "Projects began by the Army Cooperation Commission that sought to intensify army cooperation and communication between the Qing and Anqing forces have now concluded. While of course more would have always been preferable, we can be satisfied with the results and the improvements to the Anqing armies."
qiefor.73.a:0 "That's good"

qiefor.74.t:0 "Anqing Refuses Conference"
qiefor.74.d:0 "Strangely, Chen Tiaoyuan has outright denied holding a conference to discuss our country's future. This is quite outrageous not something we expect from a man like Chen. We have to make sure he stays in our orbit. We won't forget he did this."
qiefor.74.a:0 "Damn him!"

qiefor.75.t:0 "End of the Conference"
qiefor.75.d1:0 "The conference was a complete success! Chen was very willing on multiple fronts and the progress made has been tremendous. This event will most definitely be remembered as critical in China's history, as it marked the beginning of accelerated integration between the Northern and Southern Zhili."
qiefor.75.d2:0 "The conference was a success, although maybe not as much as we had hoped for. Chen Tiaoyuan and other delegation members were willing to accept some of our proposals, but refused even more. This is unfortunate, but we still made some significant progress."
qiefor.75.d3:0 "Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, most of our actual proposals have been refused by the Anqing delegation. This entire conference is a complete political failure. This is frustrating, as it seemed that Chen was willing to continue integration talks!"
qiefor.75.a:0 "Good news"
qiefor.75.b:0 "Damn!"

qiefor.76.t:0 "Dalu Yinhang and Anqing"
qiefor.76.d:0 "Dalu Yinhang, the Continental Bank, is one of our major commercial banks. Recently, through an initiative coordinated by the Beijing Liaison Council, they have made significant investments into the Anqing Clique to aid them with expanding their industry. Potentially, we could leverage this to increase our influence with Anqing. First of all, we could offer additional loans through other banks. This might strain our own resources, however. We could also decide to let them repay the loan at more favourable terms. Dalu Yinhang should be able to manage this, but they might not be happy. What will we do?"
qiefor.76.a:0 "Offer more loans"
qiefor.76.b:0 "Improve the terms"
qiefor.76.c:0 "Nothing"

qiefor.77.t:0 "Anqing Responds to Our Offer"
qiefor.77.d1:0 "The offer concerning the Dalu Yinhang loans we made Anqing must have been very sweet indeed. They have accepted and also committed themselves to taking additional steps concerning further integration. That should definitely help make a united China a reality."
qiefor.77.d2:0 "Unfortunately, what we offered was not enough for Anqing, they have utterly rejected it. Again Chen Tiaoyuan has decided to frustrate our efforts, even when it is obvious that it is to the benefit of all of China!"
qiefor.77.a:0 "Good news!"
qiefor.77.b:0 "Unfortunate"

qiefor.78.t:0 "Wu Meets Anqing Anti-Concessionists"
qiefor.78.d:0 "In order to increase support in Anqing for unification with Qing without having to go through its leader, Chen Tiaoyuan, Wu has decided to meet up with a number of leaders of the Anti-Concessions League, the largest organisation representing the usually disorganised Anti-Concessionist Movement. The League itself is split up into two factions, one of which is pro-republican and in bed with the Vermillion Society. The other is more to Wu's taste as it supports the Qing monarchy and believes that unification is necessary as soon as possible. It has been this former group that has been somewhat an obstacle to unification and that is why Wu decided to also meet with them specifically.\n\nThe leaders were impressed by Wu's words and his recent actions and policies within the Qing government. He also secretly confided in them that he also preferred a China without Puyi, but that a constitutional monarchy would mean that both camps could have what they want. He promised them that Puyi would never be able to cause damage to China, Wu would ensure that. Wu's words reassured many and even convinced some who had previously been passive pro-republican to support unification immediately. It was clear that Wu's efforts had a significant effect."
qiefor.78.a:0 "Excellent"

qiefor.79.t:0 "Anqing Reconstruction Aid"
qiefor.79.d:0 "The Anqing Clique has decided to take a cooperative approach to tackling the great reconstruction required to get their country back on its feet. Through smaller initiatives, Qing is already helping and providing significant aid. However, we can also escalate this to the national level and provide more aid there. However, this would most likely constrain us for at least a short while."
qiefor.79.a:0 "Help them more"
qiefor.79.b:0 "Enough is being done"

qiefor.80.t:0 "Qing Requests Integration!"
qiefor.80.d:0 "Now that we are in their alliance and have become very close to their government, the Qing government has decided it is time to complete unification. While a united China is nice, it would mean an almost certain end to our prized autonomy. Will we agree, for the sake of China?"
qiefor.80.a:0 "Yes, unification is urgent"
qiefor.80.b:0 "No, autonomy matters more now"

qiefor.81.t:0 "Eastern China United!"
qiefor.81.d:0 "Anqing has agreed, meaning that Eastern China is finally united!"
qiefor.81.a:0 "United we are strong"

qiefor.82.t:0 "Anqing Refuses!"
qiefor.82.d:0 "Anqing has refused integration! They dare stand against unification, even when it is so necessary in our coming battles. Unfortunately, there is little we can do right now."
qiefor.82.a:0 "They'll come around"

qiefor.83.t:0 "Qing Requests Integration!"
qiefor.83.d:0 "Now that we are in their alliance and have become very close to their government, the Qing government has decided it is time to complete unificiation. Fengtian lies defeated and China has shown it can even keep out Japan. It is most likely time that we now unite."
qiefor.83.a:0 "Yes, the time has come"
qiefor.83.b:0 "No, it will never be time"

qiefor.84.t:0 "Anqing Refuses!"
qiefor.84.d:0 "Anqing has denied our proposal for unification. This even when we defeated Fengtian and kept out Japan. We can wait and ask again, but they won't come off so easy next time."
qiefor.84.a:0 "We'll have to try again"

qiefor.85.t:0 "Anqing Refuses Again!"
qiefor.85.d:0 "Anqing has denied our proposal for unification for the second time. It is clear now that they are traitors to the cause."
qiefor.85.a:0 "War is our only option"

qiefor.86.t:0 "Wu Peifu Turns on Us!"
qiefor.86.d:0 "Following the death of League Marshal Sun Chuanfang, we had hoped that our 'ally' in Beijing, Wu Peifu, would remain loyal to our interests. It seems, however, that he has taken this moment to turn on us, and take an publicly anti-concession stance. While this has bolstered support for his unpopular regime, it means that he has demanded that the Peking-Komission, our lobbying arm in Beijing, leave the city. Facing massive riots outside the gates of their offices, most members have fled to Tianjin! At our embassy, the ambassador has sent all non-essential staff to Tianjin as well, and only a skeleton group of consular officials remain, closely watched by Wu's forces."
qiefor.86.a:0 "Damn him!"

qiefor.87.t:0 "Riots in Beijing!"
qiefor.87.d:0 "Ever since Marshal Wu Peifu refused to intervene in the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, our agents in Beijing reported an aura of tension and unease, with Wu's angering offending every single major power bloc within his own government. These tensions exploded into open strife this morning, when a group of dissatisfied Zhili generals, allied with a clique of young radical officers and the Manchu nobility, murdered Wu and President Cao Kun, and 'restored' the Emperor Puyi! Even worse, they used this coup as an opportunity to attack Germany, leveraging our unpopularity within the country to bolster their shaky new regime. Massive riots have erupted outside of our embassy and the offices of the Peking-Kommission, and our ambassador has ordered all non-essential staff to leave the city for the relative safety of Tianjin."
qiefor.87.a:0 "Curses!"

qiefor.101.t:0 "Yang Sen Holds On"
qiefor.101.d:0 "Our ally in Sichuan, Governor Yang Sen, has emerged victorious in his province's civil war! This is great news for both Sichuan and our government, as once Yan stabilizes control over the region we can have him re-join our alliance."
qiefor.101.a:0 "Great!"

qiefor.102.t:0 "[SZC.GetLeader] Takes Control of Sichuan!"
qiefor.102.d:0 "Grave news sire! It appears [SZC.GetLeader] has defeated our ally Yang Sen in Sichuan! While this is a major loss to the Zhili Clique, the province is industrially poor and militarily overstretched. Should they join any opposing faction we will crush them!"
qiefor.102.a:0 "Damn!"

qiefor.103.t:0 "Uprisings in Fujian!"
qiefor.103.d:0 "While most of China and the world assumed that the Kuomintang were destroyed in 1927, League-Marshal Sun had been fighting a low-intensity guerrilla conflict with remnants of the KMT since the end of the Northern Expedition in the Fujian area. Reports were censored from the press, and even Wu Peifu remained largely unaware of the true scope of the conflict, with Sun keeping all details tightly under wraps.\n\nWith the current chaos in the League, however, the remnants of the KMT have re-emerged and declared a new campaign of national reunification! They have declared our rightful government illegitimate, calling us'little more than a German puppet, slaving to the whims of Berlin'! We can only hope that the remnants of Sun's forces can put these traitors down."
qiefor.103.a:0 "Despicable traitors!"

qiefor.104.t:0 "Hunan Secedes from the League!"
qiefor.104.d:0 "Hunan province had fallen under the sway of Sun Chuanfang during the chaos following the 1927 Northern Expedition, with Governor Zhao Hengti re-assuming control of the province after a brief period of KMT rule. A long-time ally of Wu, Zhao has been governor of the region since 1920. However, he also has ties to the Federalist 'government' in Guangxi, tacitly supporting the federal model. As of now he has taken a strictly neutral stance, torn between his personal friendship to Wu and his political loyalties to Chen Jiongming. His neutrality, however, cannot last long, as already clouds are beginning to circle around his rule of the province."
qiefor.104.a:0 "Hopefully Wu's old friend remains loyal..."

qiefor.105.t:0 "Yiguandao Take Over Shandong!"
qiefor.105.d:0 "The esoteric, millenarian sect known as the Yiguandao have reportedly taken over the Shandong province, ousting our erstwhile governor, Zhang Zhongchang! While initially concern ran high that this sect would create chaos in our lands, level heads prevailed, pointing out Zhang's well-documented Fengtian loyalty. The cult is isolated, and once the chaos to the south has stabilized we may able to attack them, though this could cause unrest with the sizable number of adherents the religion has within our territory."
qiefor.105.a:0 "Interesting..."

qiefor.106.t:0 "Zhang Zhongchang Severs Ties with Beijing!"
qiefor.106.d:0 "The position of Shandong Governor Zhang Zhongchang had always been tenuous at best. An erratic, violent man, Zhang previously held close ties to Zhang Zuolin of the Fengtian Government, though he had been kept loyal to Beijing through bribery and lavish commissions. It appears he has used the chaos enveloping the south, however, to cast us aside. This morning, a number of our tax-collectors were halted at the provincial border, and spies within the province report he has carried out mass purges of Qing loyalists. Even worse, they report him making contact with Zhang Zuolin and the Japanese!"
qiefor.106.a:0 "Damn you, Dogmeat General!"

qiefor.107.t:0 "Zhang Zhongchang Arrested!"
qiefor.107.d:0 "Earlier today Governor Zhang Zhongchang of Shandong was arrested by magistrates reporting to Song Zheyuan, an outspoken Qing loyalist and Confucian scholar within the province. While normally the arrest of a governor would be a cause for concern, Zhang had well-documented ties to the Fengtian regime and Japan, and many in Wu's circle feared that he would use the chaos currently enveloping the south to sever ties with our government and declare his loyalty to Zhang Zuolin. These fears have been laid to rest, as newly minted Governor Song promises that he will uphold our government in the province."
qiefor.107.a:0 "Finally some good news!"

qiefor.108.t:0 "Civil War in Sichuan!"
qiefor.108.d:0 "Sichuan province, long plagued by overpopulation and food shortages, has erupted into civil war! Ever since the 1927 Restoration, Yang Sen, a close personal friend and ally of Wu Peifu, has ruled the province, but in the last few years his control began to slip. Various other factions loyal to the Fengtian regime, Kuomintang remnants, and isolationists loyal only to themselves began to consolidate power, and used the collapse of the League as the perfect moment to launch attacks on Yang's now-shaky government. Yang has yet to reach out to us for direct aid, preferring to hide the scope of the unrest, but Wu expects his old friend to come knocking for help any day."
qiefor.108.a:0 "Terrible news"

qiefor.109.t:0 "Liangguang Breaks Free!"
qiefor.109.d:0 "Liangguang, a coalition of two of the former eight provinces of the eponymous League, seceded from both that agglomeration and our regime as a whole this morning. Under the command of scholar-bureaucrat Chen Jiongming, backed up by the warlord Ma Ji, the provinces declared our government 'wholly illegitimate' and promised a 'swift end to the autocratic and anachronistic monarchy'."
qiefor.109.a:0 "Rebel scum!"

qiefor.110.t:0 "Zhao Hengti Wins Hunan Elections"
qiefor.110.d:0 "Wu Peifu's old friend, Zhao Hengti, has just won the recent provincial elections in Hunan. While this initially might seem good for us, Zhao's electoral victory also means that he has reaffirmed his commitment to his federal values, placing what he thinks are the best interests of the nation over his true loyalties to Wu."
qiefor.110.a:0 "Following your principles? Really!?"

qiefor.111.t:0 "The Buddhist General Seizes Power!"
qiefor.111.d.zhili:0 "Tang Shengzi, the 'Buddhist General' of Hunan, has deposed Wu's old friend Zhao Hengti and formally claimed rulership over Hunan! Tang is a stringent republican, and while his loyalties are at the moment are unclear, he is certainly no friend of ours. This is bad news for us, as our southern flank is now held by an enemy of our regime!"
qiefor.111.d.manchu:0 "Tang Shengzi, the 'Buddhist General' of Hunan, has deposed the Zhili lapdog Zhao Hengti and formally claimed rulership over Hunan! Tang is a stringent republican, and while his loyalties are at the moment are unclear, he is certainly no friend of ours. This is bad news for us, as our southern flank is now held by an enemy of our regime!"
qiefor.111.a:0 "Damn!"

qiefor.112.t:0 "Kuomintang Seize Power in Hunan!"
qiefor.112.d:0 "[HNN.GetLeader], a Kuomintang rebel leader in Hunan, has seized control over the province, and formally declared his allegiance to the ideals of Dr. Sun! This is a concerning development, as our southern flank now lies exposed to the foul leftists!"
qiefor.112.a:0 "Damnation!"

qiefor.113.t:0 "Zhao Hengti Clings on in Hunan"
qiefor.113.d.zhili:0 "Zhao Hengti, the Governor of Hunan, has held onto power after an election many in the province and around China are decrying as rigged and unfair. Despite his claims of loyalty to the Federalists to the south, Wu Peifu hopes that his old friend will take this experience as an example of why democracy can't be trusted."
qiefor.113.d.manchu:0 "Zhao Hengti, the Governor of Hunan, has held onto power after an election many in the province and around China are decrying as rigged and unfair. Decrying the \"barbarity\" of the Manchu Coup, Zhao has refused to swear his loyalty to us, instead declaring his autonomy. With the governor now hostile to our regime, it seems another threat has appeared on our southern flank."
qiefor.113.a:0 "Hopefully Governor Zhao remembers his loyalties..."
qiefor.113.b:0 "Damnation!"

qiefor.114.t:0 "[From.GetName] pushes for Integration!"
qiefor.114.d:0 "[From.GetName], in their new position of power, is pushing for us to join their government as an autonomous region! [LEC.GetName]'s policies have drawn the Cities close to Beijing, so this is hardly a surprise."
qiefor.114.a:0 "Let's open negotiations"
qiefor.114.b:0 "This is pointless"

qiefor.115.t:0 "Negotiations Start"
qiefor.115.d:0 "Negotiations between our government and [LEC.GetName] have begun. Already, discussions are being held on the integration of the finer matters of our government, though this is expected to take time."
qiefor.115.a:0 "Great!"

qiefor.116.t:0 "The [LEC.GetName] Refuse to Negotiate!"
qiefor.116.d:0 "The cowardly government of [LEC.GetName] have refused to enter into negotiations with our government, despite our overwhelming military strength. We could invade them, though this is likely to spark international condemnation."
qiefor.116.a:0 "Prepare the troops!"
qiefor.116.b:0 "This isn't worth it..."

qiefor.117.t:0 "The [LEC.GetName] Accept!"
qiefor.117.d:0 "The [LEC.GetName], overwhelmed by the intelligence of our diplomats, have agreed to integrate with our government! While they are still autonomous, within a few months we will be able to integrate them directly."
qiefor.117.a:0 "Great!"

qiefor.118.t:0 "The [LEC.GetName] are Ready to Integrate!"
qiefor.118.d:0 "The [LEC.GetName] are ready to integrate into our great nation, having proven to be loyal subjects."
qiefor.118.a:0 "Great!"

qiefor.119.t:0 "[From.GetName] Threaten Our Treaty Ports!"
qiefor.119.d:0 "[From.GetName] has threatened to invade our treaty ports, claiming they are integral parts of China! This is a blatant violation of our territorial sovereignty and the 99-year lease we signed with the Qing!"
qiefor.119.a:0 "Cede them, this isn't worth a fight"
qiefor.119.b:0 "Refuse these outrageous demands!"

qiefor.120.t:0 "German Cities Are Ceded!"
qiefor.120.d:0 "The Germans have caved into our demands, and vacated their port cities! Already, jubilant crowds across China are celebrating this great victory over imperialism!"
qiefor.120.a:0 "Great!"

qiefor.121.t:0 "Germany Refuses!"
qiefor.121.d:0 "The cowardly Germans have refused our offer, claiming that they will defend their ports to the last man!"
qiefor.121.a:0 "Mobilize the troops!"
qiefor.121.b:0 "This is pointless..."

qiefor.122.t:0 "[From.GetName] Want to Buy Treaty Ports!"
qiefor.122.d:0 "[From.GetName] has extended us an offer to buy our treaty ports in China. They seem willing to offer large amounts of money, and with the threat of Japan eliminated their military necessity has dropped dramatically."
qiefor.122.a:0 "OK, let's name our price!"
qiefor.122.b:0 "They aren't for sale!"

qiefor.123.t:0 "Germany Names Its Price"
qiefor.123.d:0 "Germany has named its price, a significant amount of gold. This payment is high, but it will reunite our lost territories without a single life being lost."
qiefor.123.a:0 "OK, send the cash"
qiefor.123.b:0 "Forget it, this is too expensive"

qiefor.124.t:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Back Down"
qiefor.124.d:0 "[From.GetAdjective] has balked at the price of our offer, and abruptly broke off negotiations."
qiefor.124.a:0 "Oh well"

qiefor.125.t:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Pay!"
qiefor.125.d:0 "[From.GetAdjective] has agreed to the terms of our payment, and have begun to transfer the requisite amount of gold."
qiefor.125.a:0 "Alright, start the process of the transfer"

qiefor.126.t:0 "[From.GetName] Threaten Us!"
qiefor.126.d_AST:0 "The [From.GetName] have long considered Hong Kong an integral part of their territory, and given Canada's current military status they have taken this opportunity to mobilize troops on our borders. We must petition Canada for help - hopefully their current conflicts are not too distracting!"
qiefor.126.d_LEC:0 "The [From.GetName] have long considered our status illegitimate, and while we had hoped Canada would provide protection against any revanchist activity from Beijing, it seems they have taken Canada's current military struggles as an opportunity to attempt to try and retake the Legations. We must petition Canada for aid and hope they are not too distracted!"

#Flavor Events
qieflavor.1.t:0 "Illegal Brothel Raided!"
qieflavor.1.d:0 "A cold rain fell from the sky as Zhang Beijiao, head of the Beijing Police Department’s Vice Squad, ordered his men to take up positions around a shabby-looking building on the outskirts of the city. Soft music could be heard from within, and wisps of smoke rose from the windows. \n\n‘What do you reckon - drugs or girls?’ Zhang’s second-in-command asked. ‘Both, and I’ll buy your next lunch if I’m wrong.’ Zhang stamped out his cigarette as he whistled loudly. Half a dozen men, burst open the front door and streamed into a dimly lit hall. ‘Police - don’t move!’ Zhang shouted, as men and women in various states of undress lurched into the hall, yelling and crying. The second-in-command frowned as Zhang held up a sack of opium. ‘Guess you’re buying your own lunch tomorrow.’\n\nThe policemen fanned out through the building, arresting the prostitutes and drug dealers. This was a good haul. Opium, hemp, and even cocaine, a German luxury, were found in droves. Just as Zhang was about to order his men to drag the prostitutes and their clients back to the station one of his junior officers called out. ‘Sir! You’re going to want to see this!’ Zhang could barely believe his eyes - amongst the line-up of clients, a tall, blonde, white man stood out like a sore thumb. ‘The German Legation will hear about this!’ he said in poorly accented Chinese. ‘I have friends in high places!’\n\nArresting the man will give the central government some much-needed leverage in curbing German influence, but at the same time be politically costly for the government. On the other hand, who knows what could happen if Zhang lets the man go..."
qieflavor.1.a:0 "Zhang arrests him."
qieflavor.1.b:0 "Zhang lets him go."

qieflavor.2.t:0 "Scandal in Beijing!"
qieflavor.2.d:0 "A few days ago, Hans Schröder, a promising young diplomat in the Peking-Kommission, was arrested on trumped-up charges of soliciting underage and illegal prostitutes. The Beijing Government used this as pretext to push back several German-supported reforms proposed by the Prosperity League, our lobbying group in the National Assembly. While ultimately a minor scandal this has still hit us harder than we’d like to admit."
qieflavor.2.a:0 "Damn!"

qieflavor.3.t:0 "Corruption in the Beijing Police?"
qieflavor.3.d:0 "When Zhang Beijiao made the command decision to let Hans Schröder, the young diplomat in the German Legation in Beijing he found in an illegal brothel, escape free of charge he thought he’d heard the last of the man. But now it appears one of the men on his team was enraged by the lapse in punishment, and reported the news to one of Beijing’s underground printing presses. Existing in a quasi-legal grey zone, these pamphleteers often publish scathing critiques of the Harmony Association’s government through thinly-veiled allegorical poems, historical analogies, and other ‘respectable’ topics, that skirt by government censorship laws.\n\nThis time, however, they published a full-blown attack on the ‘corruption’ of the Beijing police department, and compared the situation to the murder of Lin Weixi by British sailors in 1839, the spark that set off the First Opium War. While we’ve tried to shut down publication of this pamphlet, it has quickly spiralled out of control and has incited small protests and riots."
qieflavor.3.a:0 "Damn!"

qieflavor.4.t:0 "German in Peking seduced by Oriental beauty!"
qieflavor.4.d:0 "Tabloids across the nation are abuzz with a story from Beijing. Hans Schröder, a young diplomatic attaché in the Peking consulate, was apprehended by police after they raided an illegal brothel that also traded in drugs. Furthermore, it appears that the chief of police decided to let Schröder off without as much as a warning, probably fearing political controversy. The city is currently gridlocked by anti-German riots, and many SPD members are questioning the continued value of our involvement in China.\n\nOtto Wels, senior SPD leader, delivered a scathing speech in the Reichstag in response to the scandal. ‘While before the Party’s position was that intervention in China was pointless, it is now clear that the intervention actively harms the Chinese people. Our continued military presence undermines Chinese rule of law, and their attempts to build a stable, functioning country we can partner with against Japan.’"
qieflavor.4.a:0 "Damn!"

qieflavor.5.t:0 "Media Silence"
qieflavor.5.d:0 "It appears that our decision to let the young German we apprehended in a raid on a brothel off without as much as a warning turned out better than expected. The boy was transferred to Tianjin, and Zhang Beijiao, the police officer who let him go, was given a raise to reward his ‘quick political thinking’."
qieflavor.5.a:0 "Finally, good news!"

qieflavor.7.t:0 "Prince Rui Requests a Commission!"
qieflavor.7.d:0 "Aisin-Gioro Zaixun, Prince Rui, formerly navy minister during the cabinet of 1911, has come to us with a request. Following the promotion of the young coup backers from the Baoding academy, he requests a full naval commission! While it is true many of the admirals have lingering Zhili connections, they are mostly loyal to us. Zaixun, despite having travelled extensively to study foreign navies has never actually commanded a ship in battle, and many are skeptical of actual naval prowess."
qieflavor.7.a:0 "Promote him."
qieflavor.7.b:0 "What? Of course not!"

qieflavor.8.t:0 "Bandits Run Wild!"
qieflavor.8.d:0 "Liu Zhenhua and the rest of the 'soldiers of the forest' we hired have gone wild! Over the last few weeks they have pillaged friendly towns and even attacked government troops over women and loot! What should we do?"
qieflavor.8.a:0 "Arrest and execute them!"
qieflavor.8.b:0 "Let them stay."

qieflavor.9.t:0 "The Lindbergh of the East"
qieflavor.9.d:0 "A young pilot named Sun Tonggang has earned great renown for flying across Eurasia in his custom self-built aircraft. With the recent upheavals within the League, he has volunteered to serve our nation as a pilot, destroying our enemies from the skies! Originally based in Nanjing, he has fled the chaos currently enveloping the city for our territory in his small plane."
qieflavor.9.a:0 "Great!"

qieflavor.10.t:0 "A Refugee from New York"
qieflavor.10.d:0 "Edith Clifford Williams, an American artist, author, and librarian, has long maintained a correspondence with Hu Shih after the two met in New York while Hu was studying at Columbia University in New York City. She had an immense influence in developing Hu's political thought, and it is suspected (though unconfirmed) that the two were briefly lovers.\n\nWith war ravaging America, however, Williams has written to Shih, requesting asylum and refugee status in China. Hu has accepted, and Williams is currently en route to Beijing aboard a ship."
qieflavor.10.a:0 "Welcome to China!"

qieflavor.11.t:0 "The Houmuwu Ding"
qieflavor.11.d:0 "Archaeological excavations around Anyang, Henan Province, have unearthed a massive bronze burial vessel from the Shang Dynasty. Thought to be the largest ancient bronze in the world, its discovery has been celebrated around the world as a massive victory for Chinese culture and history. With the threat of Japan looming however, archaeologists have reburied the sarcophagus, hoping that once we have defeated Japan we can exhibit it safely in a museum."
qieflavor.11.a:0 "A great victory for Chinese culture!"

qieflavor.12.t:0 "The Clique of Strategies of the Warring States"
qieflavor.12.d:0 "Following the ascension of the YCP, an organisation made up of intellectuals who have studied in Germany called the 'Clique of Zhan Guo Ce' have emerged. They believe in statism, authoritarianism and Nietzsche's superhuman philosophy, but adapted to Chinese characteristics, promoting an esoteric blend Confucianism with Nietzscheian philosophical thought. They believe that the nation is paramount, but are not racist, adopting a pluralistic outlook on Chinese nationalism.\n\nGroups affiliated with this school of thought have started to crop up in major Chinese universities, and are lending much credence to our new government."
qieflavor.12.a:0 "Excellent!"

qieflavor.13.t:0 "A Late-Night Card Game"
qieflavor.13.d:0 "Night fell over the newly-inaugurated Presidential Palace in Beijing, as President [QIE.GetLeader] and Wu Peifu played an evening game of cards. The two men discussed politics, current events, and the current state of the world. [QIE.GetLeader] played a great hand, while Wu looked at him through narrow eyes.\n\n'You might relish the hand that you just played.' Wu started. 'But remember - who dealt you the cards that led to you sitting in this building?'.\n\n[QIE.GetLeader] raised an eyebrow. 'The Constitutional Convention selected me, of course.'\n\n'Do you *really* believe that?' asked Wu. 'I thought you were far smarter than that.'\n\n[QIE.GetLeader] leaned back in his chair. 'The state is only as strong as its military I suppose. Still - you are not immortal. One day we will need a true democracy, once our period of guidance of the nation comes to an end.'\n\n'We will see' said Wu, lighting a cigarette, and staring out over the city."
qieflavor.13.a:0 "From where does political power grow?"

qieflavor.14.t:0 "An Exiled General from the Qing Arrives"
qieflavor.14.d:0 "While our military does not reach the standard of loyalty seen in Western powers, we pride ourselves in meritocracy. The commanders and field marshals you see on the battlefield have proven their loyalty to the leader and the people. On the other hand, victory could hinge on the deadly will exhibited by some of the more mercenary commanders, those willing to do-or-die. This man comes to us from the tumultuous Qing, whose cliques have relied heavily on mercenary commanders in the past. This general comes with a sob story of how the tides turned against him, and he came ragged to us ready to fight the good fight for once. Whether he is genuine is hard to determine, but we must decide if he is worth recruiting in this already-traitorous times."
qieflavor.14.a:0 "We need all the help we can get"
qieflavor.14.b:0 "No, he could be a liability"

qieflavor.15.t:0 "[ANQ.GetLeader] Affirms our Leadership"
qieflavor.15.d:0 "Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of Anqing formally re-affirmed Puyi's leadership of China today in a radio speech broadcast across his territory. While he admitted initially finding the idea of an Emperor anachronistic, he followed that up by enthusiastically endorsing our new anti-concession stance, and Puyi's devotion to the cause. He concluded his speech with admiration for the Zhili leadership. 'An apolitical figurehead can be useful in a modern state. And with Wu Peifu and Cao Kun at the helm of our great nation, we can drive out the foreign scum who have polluted our country, and restore it to greatness!'\n\nThe speech was well received by intellectuals in Beijing and other urban areas, and some have begun to desert the NCERA and YCP for the Harmony Association, bolstering our popularity and legitimacy among the general population."
qieflavor.15.a:0 "Great news!"

qieflavor.16.t:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan - Model Governor"
qieflavor.16.d:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of Anqing, has consolidated his rule after his victory over the Nanjing Clique in the League Collapse, and while he is technically part of our government, the province enjoys a large degree of autonomy. After the League war concluded, some Zhili generals insisted on directly integrating the province into our government, but this was largely rejected due to the fragility of our own regime.\n\nIt seems now that keeping Chen's autonomy was the right move. He has just announced a massive reform project for the province, promising major industrial and legal reform. The news was greeted with enthusiasm from many business leaders in our territory, as following the German military mission's withdrawal they have sought new markets to trade with."
qieflavor.16.a:0 "Great!"

qieflavor.17.t:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan Seeks to Mend the North-South Zhili Divide"
qieflavor.17.d:0 "Ever since the conclusion of the 5th Zhili-Fengtian war and the German Intervention in 1927, the Northern and Southern halves of the Zhili Clique, lead by Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang respectively, have drifted apart. Now Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of Anqing and member of the Southern Clique has begun a concerted effort to mend the divide between the two halves. The top levels of both groups are open to the merger, but the more junior officers may harbor grudges against the other cliques, seeing potential for competition for promotion as the cliques draw closer together. Still, this is overall a good development."
qieflavor.17.a:0 "Excellent"

qieflavor.18.t:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan Proposes Joint Troop Training Exercises"
qieflavor.18.d:0 "Following his efforts to mend the North-South Zhili divide, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of Anqing has offered to host joint training exercises between our troops outside of Anqing city. His troops have learned much in their struggles against the Nanjing clique, and we both have much to learn from each other."
qieflavor.18.a:0 "Good to hear"

qieflavor.19.t:0 "Former German Factories Reopen"
qieflavor.19.d:0 "After announcing our intentions to nationalise German factories in Beijing, many in our government feared backlash from the German government. Yet with Black Monday absorbing most of their attention, we were able to conclude nationalization with little consequences. We have drawn up plans to distribute factory ownership to a variety of loyal contractors but we now face a question - what should these factories produce? Previously they produced bulk consumer goods to be shipped back to Germany, and could easily be retooled to do the same for our population. Alternatively, they could easily be modified to produce military support supplies such as blankets and cooking equipment, but having them produce weapons or actual ammunition would be prohibitively expensive."
qieflavor.19.a:0 "Civilian goods"
qieflavor.19.b:0 "Support supplies"

qieflavor.20.t:0 "Kang Tongbei Rises to Prominence"
qieflavor.20.d:0 "While Kang Tongbei, the reformer whose works the NCERA are primarily based around, died in 1927, his daughter Kang Tongbei inherited her father's genius and political talent. A graduate of Barnard College in New York City, she returned to China in 1911 to help agitate for women's rights and feminism. As the NCERA gained prominence in the tumultuous years after the German intervention and the Restoration, Kang's idea on women's empowerment became increasingly popular within some intellectual circles, while alienating some of the more conservative members of the party. With our recent efforts to honour her father, some have suggested elevating her to a full minister position within our government, both as a symbol of our direct inheritance of the legacy of Kang Youwei and as a symbol of our modernity. Others counter that this would be too controversial, and instead argue that she should continue to promote her work at the local level."
qieflavor.20.a:0 "Appoint her to the ministry!"
qieflavor.20.b:0 "Let her continue her work at the local level"

qieflavor.21.t:0 "The Emperor and the Zhili: Two Pillars of China's Independence"
qieflavor.21.d:0 "Our recent support of anti-concession intellectual movements appears to have been remarkably successful, with more and more in Beijing's nascent intelligentsia writing papers and pamphlets in support of our government. A personal favourite of Wu Peifu's, published in a journal originating in the  fiercely anti-warlord May Fourth movement, is 'The Emperor and the Zhili: Two Pillars of China's Independence'. A concise tract, it holds up Wu and his clique as bastions of China's fight against foreign domination, with the Emperor as a powerful symbol of China's modernisation. Zhang Zuolin and his Fengtian government are denounced as foreign parasites, leeching Manchuria's mineral wealth and sending it back to Japan while leaving the population impoverished."
qieflavor.21.a:0 "Great!"

qieflavor.22.t:0 "Mending the Military's Generational Divide"
qieflavor.22.d:0 "There has long been a generational gap in China's officer corps. Among the older generals, born before the upheavals of 1911 and the ensuring Warlord era, tradition and suspicion of modernisation reign supreme. Scarred by the violence and unrest that dominated most of their lives, they are politically flexible but lean conservative, hoping to restore the China of their youth. Younger officers, on the other hand, were born during the Warlord Era, and tend to favour more radical political positions.\n\nOur decision to better integrate the Baoding Army cadets into the Zhili patronage and loyalty systems has paid off, with many of the younger officers abandoning their support for the YCP and joining the Harmony Association. Some of the older generals who were sceptical of Wu's about-face regarding German support have also become more supportive of his regime, owing to conversations with their new, more politically active, subordinates."
qieflavor.22.a:0 "Great news!"

qieflavor.23.t:0 "Wu Peifu Ennobled"
qieflavor.23.d:0 "Earlier this month the Emperor announced a new set of noble titles and awards. Rather than the arcane and opaque system used in the pre-restoration Qing, these new ranks followed a model similar to most western titles. The highest rank of these is 'Duke' (Gong), only to be given to those who have 'Given the Utmost Service or Sacrifice for the Emperor and China'. The first, and so far sole recipient of this honour is to be Marshal Wu Peifu - now Duke of Qi.\n\nIn a lavish ceremony Wu solemnly accepted the honorific from the Emperor, vowing to continue to protect him and the nation for as long 'as he drew breath'."
qieflavor.23.a:0 "Long live the Duke!"

qieflavor.24.t:0 "The General and the Emperor"
qieflavor.24.d:0 "In a highly orchestrated ceremony today, Puyi invited Wu Peifu to the Forbidden city for an 'informal' luncheon. Carefully choreographed to look as 'relaxed' as possible, the two men sat together eating and discussing various matters of importance including modernising the military, reforming the bureaucracy, and other topics. After lunch, the two men were joined by the Emperor's brother, Pujie, outside the city for a brief ride on horseback. Cameras recorded the entire spectacle, and newsreel footage of the event has already been shown in cinemas in the major cities of China, as well as distributed to international agencies, which will show them that we have modernised without becoming just another Western puppet!"
qieflavor.24.a:0 "I hope they had a nice lunch"

qieflavor.25.t:0 "German-Owned Sweatshops Open"
qieflavor.25.d:0 "Major Chinese cities have seen an explosion of German factory construction following our relaxation of international investment laws. While this no doubt helps boost our economy, a number of them have engaged in somewhat dubious business practices, no doubt motivated the practically non-existent labour laws in our country compared to those in Mitteleuropa. Earlier this morning, a minor scandal erupted when it was discovered that one German factory was forcing its employees to work 20-hour shifts for next to no pay. Even worse, the factory had cut a deal with the local police to arrest and intimidate any worker who complained or made a formal protest, making us look like little more than foreign stooges."
qieflavor.25.a:0 "Oh well..."

qieflavor.26.t:0 "German Railways Receive Praise"
qieflavor.26.d:0 "While many protested the invitation of German railroad engineers to build our infrastructure, a few months on common people have already expressed praise for the improvements to the rail system. Maddeningly complex rail gauges have been standardized across the provinces, and corrupt local station owners who charged extortionate fees for tickets have been fired in favour of a standardized system for prices. Military benefits of a modern rail network aside, the German's reform of our rail system is earning overwhelming civilian praise as well."
qieflavor.26.a:0 "You can always trust the Germans to make the trains run on time"

qieflavor.27.t:0 "Imported Radios Well-Received by Troops"
qieflavor.27.d:0 "Although some in the Finance Ministry balked at the exorbitant cost of importing hundreds of cutting-edge Siemens radios from Germany, our generals report them to be overwhelmingly popular with the officer corps. In a recent action to suppress bandits in the far north of our territory, groups of our soldiers were able to effectively split up and hunt down the bandits using the radios to stay in contact. These radios have immense battlefield potential, and already appear to have had a positive effect on our troops."
qieflavor.27.a:0 "Great!"

qieflavor.100.t:0 "Aisin-Gioro Xianyu"
qieflavor.100.d:0 "Aisin-Gioro Xianyu, better known in Japanese as Yoshio Kawashima, is a Manchu noblewoman and distant cousin of Puyi who has risen to great prominence in the Qing court over the last few years. Despite her young age, she has proven herself an adept schemer and intriguer, and has worked with the Zhongshe Party to advance the goals of the Manchu nobility.\n\nBrought up in a Japanese family after she was given up for adoption in 1915, some around Puyi have questioned her loyalty to our nation. During the Emperor's exile in Tianjin, the young Xianyu pushed for Puyi to work with the Japanese instead of the Germans, a stance that put her at odds with many of the Emperor's closer family. Nearly a decade later, however, many are willing to forgive that as an act of youthful ignorance, and she has quickly made herself a force to be reckoned with. WHAT NOW??"

NFE_vive_la_empereur:0 "Vive L'Empereur!"
NFE_vive_la_empereur_desc:0 "The Empire has spoken and its voice yearns out for glory and splendor that only first Napoléon knew. France shall thus be led by a government whose vested mission shall be the restoration of the Revolutionary Empire in its entirety, modernized to the 20th century realities."

NFE_decrease_state_expenditures:0 "Drop the Expenditures of the Empire"
NFE_decrease_state_expenditures_desc:0 "France has set such a terrible burden upon itself, with having to appease the native populations and hold together the fledgling Army. By ditching the Army for some time, we can focus ourselves on other opportunities at hand, such as the ability to prepare France for its reclamation."

NFE_equality_to_africans:0 "Equality to the Africans"
NFE_equality_to_africans_desc:0 "There are no true Frenchmen that can say that the Africans are not of importance to the ability to reclaim the Birthright. By giving them equality, they may be more open to fighting for France's return home.\nIt will be a controversial decision... but then again, those men that vote against it are not true Frenchmen. They do not wish to return home. We will do so through whatever means possible."

NFE_new_grande_armee:0 "The New Grande Armée"
NFE_new_grande_armee_desc:0 "The legendary Napoléon Bonaparte would have likely scowled upon the Second Empire, its failure against the Prussians combined with lack of conquests. Our renewed Grande Armée, even if it is just formed, yet from the battle hardened veterans of the liberation, will tell his spirit that we do not intend to disappoint.France will not fail again, for failure is not an option."

NFE_african_homefront:0 "The African Homefront"
NFE_african_homefront_desc:0 "The Africans must be encouraged to work for the French war machine, as they have no interest in fighting what they believe is a foreign war. Perhaps with a little sprinkle of propaganda and a dash of benefits, they can be swayed. The African labor will provide France with much needed essential workers, workers who will lay the foundations for reclamation."

NFE_foudre_de_guerre:0 "Develop the Foudre de Guerre Strategy"
NFE_foudre_de_guerre_desc:0 "Our military commanders, notably general Charles de Gaulle, have devised an interesting method of offensives many have called truly revolutionary. The so-called "lightning warfare," or Foudre de Guerre, involves high speed to cut off enemy reinforcements combined with powerful armored columns designed to create breakthroughs."

NFE_hidden_sahara_industry:0 "Hidden Industry in the Sahara"
NFE_hidden_sahara_industry_desc:0 "The Sahara is notorious for being a barren wasteland of sand and dunes, but it has a redeeming aspect in it: the ability to hide industry in it. The heat is too intense for mankind to make its way across the desert, so by hiding factories in the blistering heat, outfitted with state of the art cooling apparatuses, we can prevent their fall into enemy hands."

NFE_expand_special_forces:0 "Imperial Special Operations"
NFE_expand_special_forces_desc:0 "Special operations have, according to their name, a special purpose. For example, we need marines, paratroopers, and mountaineers - all essential for modern warfare - in active service and have more ready at a moment's notice. The Imperial Special Operation units will be able to perform the toughest of the tasks the Empire demands."

NFE_industrial_support:0 "Industry Runs the Armies"
NFE_industrial_support_desc:0 "No army can run itself with a lack of industrial output and material. Without weapons, we cannot fight. More resources must be mobilized for the inevitable attempt of reclamation.\nMore, we say! More weapons, more ordnance, anything to crush the Communards.\nMore resources towards the greater good!"

NFE_study_egyptian_defeats:0 "Study The Deserts"
NFE_study_egyptian_defeats_desc:0 "The deserts are characterized by unopposed heat, abundant sand, and sparse life. Our soldiers must figure out a method to survive and triumph in this harsh weather, through trial and error, through sweat and toil.\nA wise idea would be to develop desert troops and special uniforms suited for the environment."

NFE_voltigeurs_and_grenadiers:0 "Modern Voltigeurs and Grenadiers"
NFE_voltigeurs_and_grenadiers_desc:0 "The Voltigeurs were elite soldiers of the Grande Armée who were the smallest and most agile soldiers. We shall copy such specialized unit, but outfit these men with sniper rifles and other accurate weapons. They shall prowl the battlefields, circling unseen, before snatching opposing prey on the other side. On the other side of the military spectrum the Grenadiers were the most elite soldiers, picked from the biggest and burliest men. Their modern incarnation shall be armed with special weaponry, such as machine guns, rocket launchers and portable mortars."

NFE_coastal_proficiency:0 "The Elite Imperial Marines"
NFE_coastal_proficiency_desc:0 "It is of no doubt to any competent general of the French Empire to say that marines are going to be the primary method of reaching the shores of our enemies. Through the open seas, they will storm the beaches and pave the path to the hostile capitals."


NFE_move_into_germany:0 "La Remise en État du Terrain"
NFE_move_into_germany_desc:0 "France's final obstacle is the ever looming Germany, who is wary of our maneuvers, but has stood idly to the side. It's time to do what should have been done in 1870, the destruction of the Germans and the establishment of French superiority.\n\nLet them feel our wrath!"

NFE_conquer_naples:0 "Take Down the Two Sicilies"
NFE_conquer_naples_desc:0 "A foothold in Europe close to France proper is in high demand, and the Two Sicilies will provide that stepping stone we need to get home. We will send our armies unto them, conquer them, and set up our plans from there.\nThe Italians probably won't be happy, but oh well. It's for the greater good."

NFE_return_to_paris:0 "Return to Paris"
NFE_return_to_paris_desc:0 "Paris is in the hands of the righteous once more! The Empire's flag flies high over Paris. It's time to move government facilities back to where they belong.\nNapoleon's spirit watches us from the heavens, and likely smiles down upon us, on this great victory - but there is more to be done.\n§CVive la France!§!"

NFE_return_to_marseille:0 "Return to Marseille"
NFE_return_to_marseille_desc:0 "Marseille is in the hands of the righteous once more! The Empire's flag flies high over Marseille. It's time to move government facilities back to France.\nNapoleon's spirit watches us from the heavens, and likely smiles down upon us, on this great victory - but there is more to be done. The rest of France must still be freed.\n§CVive la France!§!"

NFE_second_peninsular_war:0 "Put Down the Crazed Peninsula"
NFE_second_peninsular_war_desc:0 "The disastrous Peninsular Campaign was part of the reason of Napoleon's loss. We will not make the same mistakes he made - we will destroy Spain. Unprotected and alone, Spain shall find itself in a battle they cannot win. Their resistance will not be of note, either. The German threat is too much."

NFE_rectify_our_errors:0 "The Centuries Witness from Heights of the Pyramids"
NFE_rectify_our_errors_desc:0 "In the land of pharaohs and kings, they said Egypt could never be humbled.\nIt is time to prove them wrong. We will bring the Egyptian state to its knees. They will be silenced, hunted, and wrecked. Egypt shall prove to be only a minor roadblock on the path to glory."

NFE_duchy_of_warsaw:0 "The Emperor's Reckless and Bravest Vistulan Soldiers"
NFE_duchy_of_warsaw_desc:0 "We had further ambitions than just the mere Duchy of Warsaw, a renewed Polish nation. We have much grander plans than just a Duchy - a Commonwealth, if you will. A Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nBut Poland may attempt resistance, which is only their loss."

NFE_conquer_italy:0 "Olive Trees' Shade and Great Man's Ambition"
NFE_conquer_italy_desc:0 "The Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy was one of the many French client states.\nIt may no longer be of importance, due to nonexistence, but we can fix that. A Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy will provide useful, and more loyal, Italian troops."

NFE_abandon_the_entente:0 "The Truth of the British Throne"
NFE_abandon_the_entente_desc:0 "France has been humiliated and beaten time and time again in recent memory. With the grand retaking of some of our home, we are somewhat credible again. We must assert ourselves as a sovereign state, a power of the world. We will not heed the words of others as much as we used to. A position on the world stage will surely increase our credibility."

NFE_revenge_on_mexico:0 "Avenge the Cinco de Mayo Humiliation"
NFE_revenge_on_mexico_desc:0 "The French campaign in Mexico that was so long ago was a huge failure. With the Mexicans weakened now, there is now an opportunity at hand to strike them. While it may be a dangerous journey across the sea, we will be able to set up an American frontier. The frontier will pave the way for further expansion..."

NFE_conquer_tripolitania:0 "March to the Tune of the Napoleonic Bedouin"
NFE_conquer_tripolitania_desc:0 "An area that could use a little bit of French influence would be Tripolitania, but it is under guard by its people and powers abroad. We'll attack Tripolitania nevertheless, and come out on top - their lands will provide necessary industrial expansion space."

NFE_demand_malta:0 "Demand the Mediterranean Islands"
NFE_demand_malta_desc:0 "Some Mediterranean islands, such as the Balearic Islands and Malta, are of French interest. They will provide seaports and air bases to support our actions in the country. A staging ground for invasions closer to the mainland, it will take much less time to finalize these invasions."

NFE_retake_the_empire:0 "Retake the Continental Empire!"
NFE_retake_the_empire_desc:0 "Aux armes, citoyens! Formez vos bataillons! Marchez, marchez, qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons!\nWe shall chant this as we walk into France, as we walk into Marseille, as we walk into Paris. The Communards shall flee at the sight of the fury of the righteous and mighty France... The traitors will find their heads under the guillotine one by one, as we slay their kinsmen and their fellow conspirators! Death to the Communards! \n§CVive la France! Vive L'Empereur!§!"

NFE_subjugate_turkey:0 "Smoke Out the Ottoman Gatemen"
NFE_subjugate_turkey_desc:0 "The Turks threaten our position in the Middle East. A preemptive strike on their country to subdue them will suffice as a plan, where the end result shall be the establishment of a client state. We shall roll through their armies, and deal devastation to their army over and over."

NFE_reclaim_illyria:0 "Restore the Illyrian Provinces"
NFE_reclaim_illyria_desc:0 "The Illyrian Provinces were under the direct control of the First Empire. With modern technology it will be much easier to administrate these areas, but a client state may be a wiser choice in the long run. If the Illyrians happen to be not under foreign command, we have already won..."

NFE_crush_britian:0 "The Terror of Europe on Dover's Rock"
NFE_crush_britian_desc:0 "Britian has long stood in the way of France's glory. Now, with England leading the 'Eighth Coalition' against us, the time has come. No shall this lingering threat be of any concern! Ready up men, we sail for London!"

nfe.2.d:0 "The French Empire has been expanding rapidly, taking over many nations and expanding their army rapidly. It is only logical that they are planning to establish an unlawful hegemony over Europe and beyond. A Coalition is being discussed, between Canada, the British, the Germans, the Austrians, and the Russians. The Eighth Coalition, as it will be called, is targeted to bring down the French Empire before they get any stronger. The respective alliances of every nation are also to participate in the war, from the Reichspakt to the Entente.\nAre we really going to face the French Empire again?"

But if we want to restore the true France, we must retake Guiana.\nAs of this moment, a demand is being written to the government of the West Indies to hand back control of French Guiana to us. We see no reason why they could deny, it's our land..."

nfe.14.d:0 "A petition has arrived, delegated by the Empire of France, complaining about the West Indies' denial of the French request for the West Indies.

nfe.15.a:0 "Thank you. Now, give us St. Pierre back."
nfe.16.t:0 "Canada Refuses as Well"
nfe.16.d:0 "Canada, in the same amount of intelligence as the West Indies, has shot down the proposition to hand France back control of French Guiana. The population of France, while upset, has demanded that we must take matters into our own hands, but that is not viable yet."
nfe.16.a:0 "Well, what about St. Pierre?"
nfe.17.t:0 "The French Empire demands St. Pierre!"
nfe.17.d:0 "The French, their demands being more ridiculous, have requested for the annexation of St. Pierre once more. Their claim? Spurious. The answer to their demand? Come and take it from us, you won't. The response has been sent, and we await the greedy response from the Frenchmen."
nfe.17.a:0 "That'll be a NO from us."
nfe.18.t:0 "Canada Refuses the St. Pierre Proposition"
nfe.18.d:0 "The Canadians! Without apologizing, they have said "Come and take St. Pierre from us, come on, you won't!" The demand is so uncalled for, so rude!

nfe.19.a:0 "It is ours."
nfe.20.t:0 "The French Caribbean"
nfe.20.d:0 "The French Caribbean belonged to France as a colonial possession for much time, but now it is under the control of the West Indies Federation. With the recent policy of regaining the French colonial possessions, it is only logical we attempt reclamation of the French West Indies."
nfe.20.a:0 "It is ours."
nfe.21.t:0 "Canada Requests our Egypt"
nfe.21.d:0 "Canada, seemingly greedy or vengeful, has demanded the immediate transfer of Egypt to Canadian control. While they are correct in the fact that Britain used to own it, we conquered that land with blood, sweat, toil, and tears. There is no reason for us to just give it back up to Canada, who is so far away! The denial is imminent."

nfe.22.t:0 "The French Empire Responds Furiously"

nfe.23.t:0 "Souring of Relations"
nfe.23.d:0 "The relations between the British and the French have broken down rather quickly, due to territorial disputes... there is talk of abandoning the Entente, now that we have regained France and the Canadians have requested Egypt so stupidly."
nfe.23.a:0 "That's what happens..."
nfe.24.t:0 "Breakdown of Anglo-French Relations"
nfe.24.d:0 "The Anglo-French split has occured, in which Anglo and French relations are at an all-time low, a point of hostility, if you will. We are in the process of pulling out of the Entente. Our advisors are leaving Canada and other Entente-aligned nations, and it seems that we'll be hostile for the near future..."
nfe.24.a:0 "To hell with the Entente!"
nfe.25.t:0 "The French Empire leaves the Entente"
nfe.25.d:0 "The French Empire, citing an Anglo-French split, has left the Entente! Quite shocking, really, but with this unexpected bout of rage and rudeness, we're glad to see them leave!"

The War against German Hegemony is already widely popular among the soldiers of France, whose morale is at a high record. The citizens, listening to their local politicians galvanize them into action against the "impending German brute."\nOur people have been kicked into high gear, into action, and it is now able to be said that the same fury of the French that consumed the traitors in the Commune of France will rise again. The fury of France will bring the German to his knees at last, and we will have the last laugh.\n\nVive la France!"

nfe.27.t:0 "The Tenets of Foudre de Guerre"
nfe.27.d:0 "The army's new strategy, Foudre de Guerre, has been deemed revolutionary in theory, using armored vehicles such as tanks in a concentrated area to achieve breakthrough. Once breakthrough has been achieved, the goal is to end the war as fast as possible, and encircle as many enemy divisions as possible. The tactic, known to the British as "lightning warfare," has increased demand for refined engines, and better armor."
nfe.27.a:0 "A revolutionary strategy!"
nfe.28.t:0 "Patriotic Fervor"
nfe.28.d:0 "The advent of the war on Egypt has brought upon the people of the Empire a patriotic frenzy. People line streets, chanting "Vive la France!" They sign up for the armed forces, and war support has been greatly heightened due to the patriotism. It's good to know the people are on our side. The people, too, will lead France to its eventual triumph and place in the sun!"
nfe.28.a:0 "Vive la France!"
nfe.29.t:0 "Napoleonic Music"
nfe.29.d:0 "The Jeunesses Patriotes goverment has decreed the reinstatement of Napoleonic-era music and marches. This choice, while initially controversial, due to our international image, has proven to raise army morale, which is probably because of the association with Napoleon with victory. As Napoleon said, 'Victory belongs to the most persevering.' "
nfe.29.a:0 "This is the stuff..."
nfe.30.t:0 "The New Napoleonic Code"
nfe.30.d:0 "A new Napoleonic code has been implemented as law, with all the tents of the old France, plus bits and pieces of the Napoleonic Code of old, and a few more reforms have been sprinkled in the law. The code has shown its popularity with the people, and the new code ensures that France will be a beacon of liberty, despite the accusation of authoritarianism. That means nothing - we are a nation of liberty, equality, and fairness!"
nfe.30.a:0 "Fair and balanced."

Although in ruin, the Italians have hope for the government established under Napoleon. Following justice and righteousness, the French Empire will rule Italy fairly, until the Italians decide not to be ruled fairly by their own jurisdiction.

Frontiers are being erected in Madrid, Gibraltar, Malaga, Cordoba, Valencia, Barcelona, Bilbao, and La Coruna.

The Illyrian Provinces have been restored, whether they be autonomous or less so, and French soldiers are embarking to Zagreb, Split, and other Croat cities. There has not been much notable resistance from the Croatians, despite the destruction of their independent state, but that is a good thing - it will merely free up more garrisons.

And these scales continued to tip as French troops arrived in Berlin, the razing of Berlin, the destruction of so much German heritage... It may be a tragedy to see so much German architecture wrecked, but it is in return for the pain and misery caused upon France. The Empire's banner flies all over Germany, and in Germany extra garrisons are found, due to the furious German resistance. But we have pushed Germany out of their place in the sun."

Besides the fact of having belonged to Napoleon himself, the characteristic of this penis is that it would measure approximately only 2. 5 centimeters, an information considered a little embarrassing for our Emperor, which would have been the reason of its purchase which took place with the family of the chaplain of Napoleon who would have brought the relic from Saint-Helena to Corsica, the transaction took place in the morning and is obviously to remain secret, in spite of certain rumours, the penis having been seen only by the Emperor, his men and the sellers.

A solution would be to show the penis of the great emperor to the people in order to prove the rumors as false, the only problem of the plan lies in the fact that the rumors are indeed true... However, the genius of the Bonapartes was once again illustrated when our Emperor proposed to our secret services a bold operation called 'Imperial Penis'. It would consist in sending a small commando to the heart of the icy lands of Russia, more precisely to St. Petersburg, where the penis of the famous mystic Rasputin is kept, which would be of an exponential size. Following this theft, the commando will return to Algiers, where the Russian's penis will be passed off as Napoleon's to put a definitive end to the idiotic accusations of our political opponents.\n\nThe plan has been approved by the Emperor as well as the General Staff and the results should show up within a month or so."

The journalists as well as the republicans and socialists were all amazed at the size of such a monster, the caricatures and mockery soon ceased to be written, giving way to bonapartist journalists who showed such a size as being a 'proof of the legitimacy of the Bonapartes' or even as being obviously 'hereditary'. The relic was then exhibited in the largest museum in Algiers, which received an extraordinarily large number of visitors.\n\nThe operation was therefore a huge success for the government and the Emperor who succeeded in galvanizing the people to lead them towards the liberation of the Metropolis in the future."

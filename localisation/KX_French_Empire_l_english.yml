NFE_vive_la_empereur:0 "Vive L'Empereur!"
NFE_vive_la_empereur_desc:0 "The French Empire has been in the ditch since 1870, the humiliating defeat at the hands of the Prussians.\nWe will no longer tolerate these injustices... the losses France has endured. The only way forward in these trying times is the Bonapartists, who will bring France back home...\n§CVive L'Empereur!§!"

NFE_decrease_state_expenditures:0 "Drop the Expenditures of the Empire"
NFE_decrease_state_expenditures_desc:0 "France has set such a terrible burden upon itself, with having to appease the native populations and hold together the fledgling Army. By ditching the Army for some time, we can focus ourselves on other opportunities at hand, such as the ability to prepare France for its reclamation."

NFE_equality_to_africans:0 "Equality to the Africans"
NFE_equality_to_africans_desc:0 "There are no true Frenchmen that can say that the Africans are not of importance to the ability to reclaim the Birthright. By giving them equality, they may be more open to fighting for France's return home.\nIt will be a controversial decision... but then again, those men that vote against it are not true Frenchmen. They do not wish to return home. We will do so through whatever means possible."

NFE_new_grande_armee:0 "The New Grande Armee"
NFE_new_grande_armee_desc:0 "The legendary Napoleon Bonaparte likely scowled upon the Second Empire, its failure against the Prussians, and its lack of conquest. Our renewed Grande Armee, even if it is locked in the binds of the African continent, will tell his spirit that we do not intend to disappoint him.\nThis time will be different. France will not fail again.\nFailure is not an option this time."

NFE_african_homefront:0 "The African Homefront"
NFE_african_homefront_desc:0 "The Africans must be encouraged to work for the French war machine, as they have no interest in fighting what they believe is a foreign war. Perhaps with a little sprinkle of propaganda and a dash of benefits, they can be swayed. The African labor will provide France with much needed essential workers, workers who will lay the foundations for reclamation."

NFE_foudre_de_guerre:0 "Develop the Foudre de Guerre Strategy"
NFE_foudre_de_guerre_desc:0 "Our military commanders, notably general Charles de Gaulle, have devised an interesting method of offensives, which he calls revolutionary, but it has yet to be seen. He calls it "lightning warfare," or Foudre de Guerre. It involves speed to cut off enemy reinforcements, powerful armored columns designed to create breakthroughs, and all around is focused on the mobility of man."

NFE_hidden_sahara_industry:0 "Hidden Industry in the Sahara"
NFE_hidden_sahara_industry_desc:0 "The Sahara is notorious for being a barren wasteland of sand and dunes, but it has a redeeming aspect in it: the ability to hide industry in it. The heat is too intense for mankind to make its way across the desert, so by hiding factories in the blistering heat, outfitted with state of the art cooling apparatuses, we can prevent their fall into enemy hands."

NFE_expand_special_forces:0 "Imperial Special Operations"
NFE_expand_special_forces_desc:0 "Special operations have, according to their name, a special operation. For example, we must need marines, paratroopers, and mountaineers - all essential for reclamation - in active service and have more ready at a moment's notice. The special operations will be able to perform the invasion of the mainland easier."

NFE_industrial_support:0 "Industry Runs the Armies"
NFE_industrial_support_desc:0 "No army can run itself with a lack of industrial output and material. Without weapons, we cannot fight. More resources must be mobilized for the inevitable attempt of reclamation.\nMore, we say! More weapons, more ordnance, anything to crush the Communards.\nMore resources towards the greater good!"

NFE_study_egyptian_defeats:0 "Study The Deserts"
NFE_study_egyptian_defeats_desc:0 "The deserts are characterized by unopposed heat, abundant sand, and sparse life. Our soldiers must figure out a method to survive and triumph in this harsh weather, through trial and error, through sweat and toil.\nA wise idea would be to develop desert troops and special uniforms suited for the environment."

NFE_voltigeurs_and_grenadiers:0 "Modern Voltigeurs and Grenadiers"
NFE_voltigeurs_and_grenadiers_desc:0 "The Voltigeurs were elite soldiers of the Grande Armee who were the smallest, most agile soldiers. We shall do the same, but outfit these men with sniper rifles and other accurate weapons. They shall prowl the battlefields, circling unseen, before snatching opposing prey on the other side.\nThe Grenadiers were the most elite soldiers, the biggest and burliest men - they shall be armed with extra, special weaponry, such as machine guns, rocket launchers, and mortars."

NFE_coastal_proficiency:0 "The Elite Imperial Marines"
NFE_coastal_proficiency_desc:0 "It is of no doubt to any competent military general of the French Empire to say that marines are going to be the primary method of reaching the shores of France.\nThrough the open seas, they will storm the beaches, and they will pave the path to the homeward bound."

NFE_all_for_the_empire:0 "All for the Empire!"
NFE_all_for_the_empire_desc:0 "The blood, body, and soul of the rightful France must be mobilized, with every organ pushed to its limits. France shall exercise, prepare for the day of homecoming. Every Frenchman is required to work and do that work well, for a easier life once the mainland has been reconquered from the cold hands of the Communards."

NFE_move_into_germany:0 "La Remise en État du Terrain"
NFE_move_into_germany_desc:0 "France's final obstacle is the ever looming Germany, who is wary of our maneuvers, but has stood idly to the side. It's time to do what should have been done in 1870, the destruction of the Germans and the establishment of French superiority.\n\nLet them feel our wrath!"

NFE_conquer_naples:0 "Take Down the Two Sicilies"
NFE_conquer_naples_desc:0 "A foothold in Europe close to France proper is in high demand, and the Two Sicilies will provide that stepping stone we need to get home. We will send our armies unto them, conquer them, and set up our plans from there.\nThe Italians probably won't be happy, but oh well. It's for the greater good."

NFE_return_to_paris:0 "Return to Paris"
NFE_return_to_paris_desc:0 "Paris is in the hands of the righteous once more! The Empire's flag flies high over Paris. It's time to move government facilities back to where they belong.\nNapoleon's spirit watches us from the heavens, and likely smiles down upon us, on this great victory - but there is more to be done.\n§CVive la France!§!"

NFE_return_to_marseille:0 "Return to Marseille"
NFE_return_to_marseille_desc:0 "Marseille is in the hands of the righteous once more! The Empire's flag flies high over Marseille. It's time to move government facilities back to France.\nNapoleon's spirit watches us from the heavens, and likely smiles down upon us, on this great victory - but there is more to be done. The rest of France must still be freed.\n§CVive la France!§!"

NFE_second_peninsular_war:0 "Redo the Peninsular Campaign"
NFE_second_peninsular_war_desc:0 "The disastrous Peninsular Campaign was part of the reason of Napoleon's loss. We will not make the same mistakes he made - we will destroy Spain. Unprotected and alone, Spain shall find itself in a battle they cannot win. Their resistance will not be of note, either. The German threat is too much."

NFE_rectify_our_errors:0 "Second Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt"
NFE_rectify_our_errors_desc:0 "In the land of pharaohs and kings, they said Egypt could never be humbled.\nIt is time to prove them wrong. We will bring the Egyptian state to its knees. They will be silenced, hunted, and wrecked. Egypt shall prove to be only a minor roadblock on the path to glory."

NFE_duchy_of_warsaw:0 "Re-Establish the Duchy of Warsaw"
NFE_duchy_of_warsaw_desc:0 "We had further ambitions than just the mere Duchy of Warsaw, a renewed Polish nation. We have much grander plans than just a Duchy - a Commonwealth, if you will. A Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nBut Poland may attempt resistance, which is only their loss."

NFE_conquer_rest_italy:0 "Reestablish Napoleonic Italy"
NFE_conquer_rest_italy_desc:0 "The Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy was one of the many French client states.\nIt may no longer be of importance, due to nonexistence, but we can fix that. A Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy will provide useful, and more loyal, Italian troops."

NFE_abandon_the_entente:0 "France's Pedestal on the World Stage"
NFE_abandon_the_entente_desc:0 "France has been humiliated and beaten time and time again in recent memory. With the grand retaking of some of our home, we are somewhat credible again. We must assert ourselves as a sovereign state, a power of the world. We will not heed the words of others as much as we used to. A position on the world stage will surely increase our credibility."

NFE_revenge_on_mexico:0 "The Last Laugh"
NFE_revenge_on_mexico_desc:0 "The French campaign in Mexico that was so long ago was a huge failure. With the Mexicans weakened now, there is now an opportunity at hand to strike them. While it may be a dangerous journey across the sea, we will be able to set up an American frontier. The frontier will pave the way for further expansion..."

NFE_conquer_tripolitania:0 "Conquer Tripolitania"
NFE_conquer_tripolitania_desc:0 "An area that could use a little bit of French influence would be Tripolitania, but it is under guard by its people and powers abroad. We'll attack Tripolitania nevertheless, and come out on top - their lands will provide necessary industrial expansion space."

NFE_demand_malta:0 "Demand the Mediterranean Islands"
NFE_demand_malta_desc:0 "Some Mediterranean islands, such as the Balearic Islands and Malta, are of French interest. They will provide seaports and air bases to support our actions in the country. A staging ground for invasions closer to the mainland, it will take much less time to finalize these invasions."

NFE_retake_the_empire:0 "Retake the Continental Empire!"
NFE_retake_the_empire_desc:0 "Aux armes, citoyens! Formez vos bataillons! Marchez, marchez, qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons!\nWe shall chant this as we walk into France, as we walk into Marseille, as we walk into Paris. The Communards shall flee at the sight of the fury of the righteous and mighty France... The traitors will find their heads under the guillotine one by one, as we slay their kinsmen and their fellow conspirators! Death to the Communards! \n§CVive la France! Vive L'Empereur!§!"

NFE_subjugate_turkey:0 "Butcher the Turkey"
NFE_subjugate_turkey_desc:0 "The Turks threaten our position in the Middle East. A preemptive strike on their country to subdue them will suffice as a plan, where the end result shall be the establishment of a client state. We shall roll through their armies, and deal devastation to their army over and over."

NFE_reclaim_illyria:0 "Restore the Illyrian Provinces"
NFE_reclaim_illyria_desc:0 "The Illyrian Provinces were under the direct control of the First Empire. With modern technology it will be much easier to administrate these areas, but a client state may be a wiser choice in the long run. If the Illyrians happen to be not under foreign command, we have already won..."

It is only logical that they are planning to establish an unlawful hegemony over Europe and beyond. A Coalition is being discussed, between Canada, the British, the Germans, the Austrians, and the Russians. The Eighth Coalition, as it will be called, is targeted to bring down the French Empire before they get any stronger. The respective alliances of every nation are also to participate in the war, from the Reichspakt to the Entente.\nAre we really going to face the French Empire again?"

But if we want to restore the true France, we must retake Guiana.\nAs of this moment, a demand is being written to the government of the West Indies to hand back control of French Guiana to us. We see no reason why they could deny, it's our land..."
nfe.11.a:0 "Demand its return."
nfe.12.t:0 "Status of French Guiana"
nfe.12.d:0 "The French Empire has issued a demand to our government - hand back control of French Guiana. While a righteous claim, it's still our land, and we will not give it up unless Canada intervenes. The response has been issued back to the French government. It obviously won't sit well with them."

nfe.13.t:0 "The West Indies Union Denies Request for Guiana"
nfe.13.d:0 "The West Indies Union, in all its endless wisdom, has denied the request for French Guiana.

nfe.14.d:0 "A petition has arrived, delegated by the Empire of France, complaining about the West Indies' denial of the French request for the West Indies.

nfe.15.a:0 "Thank you. Now, give us St. Pierre back."
nfe.16.t:0 "Canada Refuses as Well"
nfe.16.d:0 "Canada, in the same amount of intelligence as the West Indies, has shot down the proposition to hand France back control of French Guiana. The population of France, while upset, has demanded that we must take matters into our own hands, but that is not viable yet."
nfe.16.a:0 "Well, what about St. Pierre?"
nfe.17.t:0 "The French Empire demands St. Pierre!"
nfe.17.d:0 "The French, their demands being more ridiculous, have requested for the annexation of St. Pierre once more. Their claim? Spurious. The answer to their demand? Come and take it from us, you won't. The response has been sent, and we await the greedy response from the Frenchmen."
nfe.17.a:0 "That'll be a NO from us."
nfe.18.t:0 "Canada Refuses the St. Pierre Proposition"
nfe.18.d:0 "The Canadians! Without apologizing, they have said "Come and take St. Pierre from us, come on, you won't!" The demand is so uncalled for, so rude!

nfe.19.a:0 "It is ours."
nfe.20.t:0 "The French Caribbean"
nfe.20.d:0 "The French Caribbean belonged to France as a colonial possession for much time, but now it is under the control of the West Indies Federation. With the recent policy of regaining the French colonial possessions, it is only logical we attempt reclamation of the French West Indies."
nfe.20.a:0 "It is ours."
nfe.21.t:0 "Canada Requests our Egypt"
nfe.21.d:0 "Canada, seemingly greedy or vengeful, has demanded the immediate transfer of Egypt to Canadian control. While they are correct in the fact that Britain used to own it, we conquered that land with blood, sweat, toil, and tears. There is no reason for us to just give it back up to Canada, who is so far away! The denial is imminent."
nfe.21.a:0 "NO! We conquered that land ourselves!"
nfe.22.t:0 "The French Empire Responds Furiously"
nfe.22.d:0 "The French Empire responded to our demand in a flurry of furious remarks and questions. Obviously enraged by the advent of our "greedy demand," they have said that no such transfer will occur."
nfe.22.a:0 "..."
nfe.23.t:0 "Souring of Relations"
nfe.23.d:0 "The relations between the British and the French have broken down rather quickly, due to territorial disputes... there is talk of abandoning the Entente, now that we have regained France and the Canadians have requested Egypt so stupidly."
nfe.23.a:0 "That's what happens..."
nfe.24.t:0 "Breakdown of Anglo-French Relations"
nfe.24.d:0 "The Anglo-French split has occured, in which Anglo and French relations are at an all-time low, a point of hostility, if you will. We are in the process of pulling out of the Entente.

nfe.26.t:0 "The Call to Arms"
nfe.26.d:0 "The citizens of France have been assembled in squares, streets, anything with space, to hear of the War. The War against German Hegemony is already widely popular among the soldiers of France, whose morale is at a high record. The citizens, listening to their local politicians galvanize them into action against the "impending German brute."\nOur people have been kicked into high gear, into action, and it is now able to be said that the same fury of the French that consumed the traitors in the Commune of France will rise again. The fury of France will bring the German to his knees at last, and we will have the last laugh.\n\nVive la France!"
nfe.26.a:0 "Aux armes, citoyens!"
nfe.27.t:0 "The Tenets of Foudre de Guerre"
nfe.27.d:0 "Charles de Gaulle's new strategy, Foudre de Guerre, has been deemed revolutionary in theory, using armored vehicles such as tanks in a concentrated area to achieve breakthrough. Once breakthrough has been achieved, the goal is to end the war as fast as possible, and encircle as many enemy divisions as possible. The tactic, known to the British as "lightning warfare," has increased demand for refined engines, and better armor."
nfe.27.a:0 "A revolutionary strategy!"
nfe.28.t:0 "Patriotic Fervor"
nfe.28.d:0 "The advent of the war on Egypt has brought upon the people of the Empire a patriotic frenzy. People line streets, chanting "Vive la France!" They sign up for the armed forces, and war support has been greatly heightened due to the patriotism. It's good to know the people are on our side. The people, too, will lead France to its eventual triumph and place in the sun!"
nfe.28.a:0 "Vive la France!"
nfe.29.t:0 "Napoleonic Music"
nfe.29.d:0 "Napoleon VI has decreed the reinstatement of Napoleonic-era music and marches. This choice, while initially controversial, due to our international image, has proven to raise army morale, which is probably because of the association with Napoleon with victory. As Napoleon said, "Victory belongs to the most perservering." "
nfe.29.a:0 "This is the stuff..."
nfe.30.t:0 "The New Napoleonic Code"
nfe.30.d:0 "A new Napoleonic code has been implemented as law, with all the tents of the old France, plus bits and pieces of the Napoleonic Code of old, and a few more reforms have been sprinkled in the law. The code has shown its popularity with the people, and the new code ensures that France will be a beacon of liberty, despite the "muh paternal autocracy." That means nothing - we are a nation of liberty, equality, and fairness!"
nfe.30.a:0 "Fair and balanced."

Although in ruin, the Italians have hope for the government established under Napoleon. Following justice and righteousness, the French Empire will rule Italy fairly, until the Italians decide not to be ruled fairly by their own jurisdiction.

Spanish resistance has arisen, but battered from the Civil War, it is likely they will be disorganized and easy to beat, with their political differences halting attempts at alliance. Frontiers are being erected in Madrid, Gibraltar, Malaga, Cordoba, Valencia, Barcelona, Bilbao, and La Coruna.

The Illyrian Provinces have been restored, whether they be autonomous or less so, and French soldiers are embarking to Zagreb, Split, and other Croat cities. There has not been much notable resistance from the Croatians, despite the destruction of their independent state, but that is a good thing - it will merely free up more garrisons.

France's fury has built up for the very moment that was the Invasion of Germany, which saw the French army strike Germany with all it had - the Germans fought in the hills, on the Rhine, in the streets, and in the forests, but as the war progressed, the scales tipped for France.  And these scales continued to tip as French troops arrived in Berlin, the razing of Berlin, the destruction of so much German heritage... It may be a tragedy to see so much German architecture wrecked, but it is in return for the pain and misery caused upon France. The Empire's banner flies all over Germany, and in Germany extra garrisons are found, due to the furious German resistance. But we have pushed Germany out of their place in the sun."

The campaign has showed that the new Empire is not to be messed with. With Egypt once more reduced to a colonial possession, this time under the French boot, we can see about further expansion eastwards, perhaps into Turkey or Persia.

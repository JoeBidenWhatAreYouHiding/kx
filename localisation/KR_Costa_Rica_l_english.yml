### Leaders ###
POLITICS_RICARDO_JIMENEZ_OREAMUNO_DESC:0 "The son of two-time president Jesús Jiménez Zamora, Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno rose to prominence before the Weltkrieg. In his first term as president between 1910 and 1914, he oversaw the repayment of the country's crippling national debt. By his third stint as president, the country's national debt had again skyrocketed, and again President Jiménez attempted, less successfully than before, to bring Costa Rica back from the brink of default.\nLooking forward, Jiménez fears that without a principled hand to guide it, Costa Rican democracy could be hijacked by foreign economic interests. Perhaps though he wishes to retire from politics, such fears will ensure his continued presence."
POLITICS_COUNCIL_COS_DESC:0 "With great political disruption at hand, a mostly conservative Council of Ministers has been appointed collectively act as both head of state and government while national affairs are sorted."

### Decisions ###
COS_ZKG_decisions:0 "Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft"
COS_ZKG_decisions_desc:0 "Our nation is almost fully controlled by a select elite of Coffee barons. Due to the American depression and the subsequent shockwaves, many of these barons with German roots have bound together and have created the §YZentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft§! or §YZKG§!. Their power is large but could also be used to our advantage should we play our cards right.\n\nInfluence of the §YZKG§! : £coffee_texticon [?party_popularity@authoritarian_democrat|%R0]\n"

COS_Combat_Social_Inequality:0 "Combat Social Inequality"
COS_Combat_Social_Inequality_desc:0 "Even though the Atlantic Workers Congress has fought hard to secure the little rights plantation workers now have, the great divide between the wealthy German Coffee Barons and the common men remains great. Further social concessions will help us improve the life of the man on the street and also reduce the pull of these companies on political affairs."
COS_German_Cultural_Program:0 "German Cultural Exchange Program"
COS_German_Cultural_Program_desc:0 "Strong ties between our nation and the members of the German sphere in Europe has led to a great influx of art, literary works and an exchange of cultural heritage. Universities all across Germany and Flanders-Wallonia are also responsible for the better part of our highly educated populace and have drastically influenced the minds of our people."
COS_Extend_Loan_decision:0 "Extend our Loans"
COS_Extend_Loan_decision_desc:0 "Happily profiting from the lingering depression and now from the Black Monday catastrophe, investors and wealthy capitalists have loaned us the capital necessary to bail out the ZKG. Now these loan sharks are returning for the money we no longer have. Offering them small political concessions and selling some of our land to these individuals could mitigate the issue but will not serve as a permanent solution."
COS_Sell_Government_Land_decision:0 "Sell off Government Land"
COS_Sell_Government_Land_decision_desc:0 "For decades the governments of Central America have used foreign companies to back up their economies through the sales of vast swathes of plantation land. It is only right that we do so as well, no?"
COS_Land_Survey:0 "Survey the Acquired Land"
COS_Land_Survey_desc:0 "Whilst large portions of our nation are ideal for plantations, not all of them are suited for the Coffee production. Scouting out terrain and determining whether or not it is worth the price we're asking for it is therefore key to the success of their investment."
COS_Extend_Connections:0 "Extend Railroad Connections"
COS_Extend_Connections_desc:0 "As the plantations keep growing and industry starts to foster, the need for better infrastructure increases as well. Following the example of Keith in the 19th Century, the ZKG has offered to extend the railroads if we are to sufficiently compensate them with workable plantation land."
COS_Hire_Foreign_Engineers:0 "Hire Foreign Engineers"
COS_Hire_Foreign_Engineers_desc:0 "Small mineral reserves have been discovered during the construction of the railroad and have prompted the ZKG to hire European Engineers to investigate the viability of these deposits and to further assist in the construction of bridges and tunnels."
COS_Plantation_Expansion:0 "Expand the ZKG Plantations"
COS_Plantation_Expansion_desc:0 "Positive response by both the company itself and other investors plus a rapid response from our government has led to an agreement concerning the new plantations. Promising to rely on mostly native Costa Rican labour and accepting the demands of the Atlantic Workers Congress, all parties involved have come to a suitable agreement and the first hectares of land have been put in action."

COS_UFC_decisions:0 "United Fruit Company"
COS_UFC_decisions_desc:0 "Ever since the American Keith set foot in Costa Rica and received the contract to establish a railroad network in our nation, his company the §YUnited Fruit Company§! or §YUFC§! has played an important role in Costa Rican economics. The great success of the company however did not solely remain Costa Rican and through shrewd investment the company has established a network of subsidiaries and plantations all across the Caribbean, bringing great fortune to these nations but also causing massive social disruption, often leading to §Rstrikes§!, §Rviolence§! and §Rpolitical disaster§!.\n\nInfluence of the §YUFC§! : £banana_texticon [?party_popularity@market_liberal|%R0]\n"

COS_Sell_Government_Land_UFC_decision:0 "Sell Government Land to the UFC"
COS_Sell_Government_Land_UFC_decision_desc:0 "For decades the governments of Central America have used foreign companies to back up their economies through the sales of vast swathes of plantation land. It is only right that we do so as well, no?"
COS_Build_New_Telephone_Lines:0 "Commission new Telegraph Lines"
COS_Build_New_Telephone_Lines_desc:0 "Communication between the two sides of our nation has always been a tricky affair often leading to miscommunication or unchecked corruption. Using their influence and expertise in the trade, the UFC has offered to expand our telegraph network in exchange for further concessions and the promise that we won't object to their Jamaican migrant workers."
COS_Establish_UFC_Headquarters_decision:0 "Establish UFC Headquarters in Puerto Limon"
COS_Establish_UFC_Headquarters_decision_desc:0 "As America descends into chaos and the individual nation states of Central America smell their chance to escape from the UFC monopoly, the company has proposed to expand their offices in Costa Rica and to establish Limon as their operational Headquarters for the Caribbean Region."
COS_Limon_Bananas:0 "Develop Banana Plantations in Limon"
COS_Limon_Bananas_desc:0 "Originally handed over to the UFC when Keith first started the company in exchange for the construction of a railroad across our nation, the Banana boom has struck the region and completely transformed it. Thousands of black Jamaican workers have been imported to work in the plantations and repeated sales of government land to the company have developed the region into an important economic hub, further aided by the key Puerto Limon harbour."
COS_Jamaica_Sugar:0 "Develop Sugar Plantations in Jamaica"
COS_Jamaica_Sugar_desc:0 "First operating under the West India Interest in the 18th Century and later fusing with the present-day West Indies Federation, the island of Jamaica has always been one of the main exporters of Sugar to the European Continent. Large investments by the British and extensive use of slavery exponentially increased the amount of sugar plantations on the island during much of its initial history and still leaves his mark on the nation as sugar remains its primary export.\n\nInvestors from the UFC have also shown interest in these rich plantations and have slowly but surely started buying land on the island to increase their own profit."
COS_Jamaica_Bananas:0 "Develop Banana Plantations in Jamaica"
COS_Jamaica_Bananas_desc:0 "Founded by a sailor called Lorenzo Dow Baker in 1870, the Boston Fruit Company was the start of the UFC operations on the island. Later merging with the company of Keith, the United Fruit Company started its rise to power and became one of the largest employers on the island. Continued growth of our operations in Jamaica should therefore be critical and have our priority when planning our next step."
COS_Cuba_Sugar:0 "Develop Sugar Plantations in Cuba"
COS_Cuba_Sugar_desc:0 "Mainly situated in the Oriente Province of the nation, the holdings of the UFC on Cuba aren't as influential to the nations politics as they are elsewhere in the region. Multiple sugar mills however exist on the island and it would be in our best interest and that of the company to keep these afloat."
COS_Honduras_Palm_Oil:0 "Develop Palm Plantations in Honduras"
COS_Honduras_Palm_Oil_desc:0 "Assisting in the military coup overthrowing president Davila and reinstating general Bonilla, Samuel Zemurray was able to extract massive concessions from the government of the nation. Offering to build up the infrastructure in the nation in exchange for enormous swathes of land, his company not only profiled itself as the motor of the Honduran economy but has since then branched out across the region before fusing together with the UFC.\n\nThe latter now not only holds great interests in the Banana production but is also responsible for sizable amounts of Palm Oil and Abaca"
COS_Honduras_Abaca:0 "Develop Abaca Plantations in Honduras"
COS_Honduras_Abaca_desc:0 "Assisting in the military coup overthrowing president Davila and reinstating general Bonilla, Samuel Zemurray was able to extract massive concessions from the government of the nation. Offering to build up the infrastructure in the nation in exchange for enormous swathes of land, his company not only profiled itself as the motor of the Honduran economy but has since then branched out across the region before fusing together with the UFC.\n\nThe latter now not only holds great interests in the Banana production but is also responsible for sizable amounts of Palm Oil and Abaca"

COS_Guatemala_Abaca:0 "Develop Abaca Plantations in Guatemala"
COS_Guatemala_Abaca_desc:0 "Not only does the UFC control a sizeable percentage of all Guatemalan land but it also owns schools, railroads, housing companies and much more. To say the Guatemalan economy depends on the UFC would be an understatement and we can not let this influence falter for the safety of the company.\n\nMainly situated on the Eastern flank of the nation close to Honduras, the Abaca lands are providing a valuable alternative to the otherwise Banana dominated operations of the company."
COS_Guatemala_Banana:0 "Develop Banana Plantations in Guatemala"
COS_Guatemala_Banana_desc:0 "Not only does the UFC control a sizeable percentage of all Guatemalan land but it also owns schools, railroads, housing companies and much more. To say the Guatemalan economy depends on the UFC would be an understatement and we cannot let this influence falter for the safety of the company.\n\nMainly situated on the Western flank of the nation, the Banana plantations of Guatemala are the company's most successful operation yet and are not only contributing to continued growth of the stocks but are also allowing the UFC to branch out across the Caribbean and even into South America."
COS_Colombia_Banana:0 "Develop Banana Plantations in Colombia"
COS_Colombia_Banana_desc:0 "Centered around important Banana regions such as Magdalena, the company has had a troubled history in the South American nation. Various strikes, violent escalations between the workers and strikebreakers of the UFC have shaped the nation and the company is struggling to hold on to these assets with the American Civil War ravaging all in its path."
COS_Nicaragua_Palm_Oil:0 "Develop Palm Plantations in Nicaragua"

COS_Market_decisions:0 "Global Trade"
COS_Market_decisions_desc:0 "As nations all across the globe have started to drastically increase their weapons industry smelling an opportunity to make a profit, we have the resources to particapate in this trade as well.\n\nUFC Profit : §Y[?COS.cos_profit_factor]§!\n"

With a heavy focus on following the "Rerum Novarum" and adapting it to Costa Rican society, he has outlined multiple programs to aid the common man and solve the country's largest issues caused by §Rpoverty§! and §Rbad sanitation§!."

COS_Combat_Footworm:0 "Combat Footworm in the Lowlands"
COS_Combat_Footworm_desc:0 "Nearly 70% of the population in the Lowlands suffers from the Footworm disease. As a doctor himself, our president has proposed a program wherein all children in the first grade will be given shoes by the state and the medical supplies necessary to rid ourselves of the problem."
COS_Stimulate_Fishing_Industry:0 "Stimulate Fishing Industry"
COS_Stimulate_Fishing_Industry_desc:0 "One of the major issues in Costa Rica is the very limited diet the average citizen consumes which leads to a great deficit of protein. Therefore the president has decided to kill two birds with one stone and plans to increase subsidies for the coastal region, boost the fishing industry and distribute seafood to the interior of the nation."
COS_Disband_Petroleum_Monopoly:0 "Disband the Petroleum Monopoly"
COS_Disband_Petroleum_Monopoly_desc:0 "Around 10 years ago, the entire gasoline and petroleum sector of our nation came under control of a single national company. Hoping to kickstart the economy and attract further foreign capital, the president has now proposed to break open the monopoly and let the Free Market take over."
COS_Create_Housing_Cooperatives:0 "Create Low-cost Housing Co-operatives"
COS_Create_Housing_Cooperatives_desc:0 "To combat the rising amount of homeless people in our nation and to provide quick and efficient solutions should a crisis occur, we should create housing co-operatives which will be supported by the National Bank of Securities."

COS_Cortes_decisions:0 "Policy of [COS.GetLeader]"
COS_Cortes_decisions_desc:0 "Building on the legacy of Ricardo Jimenez, §Y[COS.GetLeader]§! has announced that his focus shall be on combating the economic disaster that has overtaken the §YZKG§! and to improve the §Rterrible infrastructure§! of his nation through large government programs."

COS_Build_New_Schools:0 "Build New Schools"
COS_Build_New_Schools_desc:0 "Continuing the Education reform announced by our President, plans have been drafted up for the construction of new schools on the countryside to reduce illiteracy even further. Priding ourselves on the saying that "Costa Rica has more teachers than soldiers", reception for this decision has been overwhelmingly positive no matter the cost."
COS_Infrastructural_Improvements:0 "Infrastructural Improvements"
COS_Infrastructural_Improvements_desc:0 "As the majority of our shipping takes place in the Limon region, the Pacific coast has been fairly neglected by previous administrations. To combat this issue, the president has decreed that in cooperation with companies like the UFC the port towns of the Pacific will be further connected to the rest of the nation and new docks will be created."
COS_Silence_the_Press:0 "Silence the Press"
COS_Silence_the_Press_desc:0 "Whilst we carry freedom of speech as one of our proudest values, the increased presence of syndicalist propaganda and the continued slandering of the Cortes administration is becoming troublesome and has greatly angered the president who is already struggling to keep the nation together due to the economic collapse. Silencing a few newspapers like "Trabaio" could mitigate the issue perhaps"
COS_Expand_Manufacturing_Industry:0 "Expand the Manufacturing Industry"
COS_Expand_Manufacturing_Industry_desc:0 "Contrary to most Central American nations, Costa Rica has a well-developed manufacturing industry and is quickly expanding this sector across the nation. The main issue with these businesses is that they greatly lack in size which makes them inefficient on a national scale. Fusing some of our over 7000 little "factories" will greatly help us reduce this inefficiency and will prepare ourselves for more sorts of heavy industry."

COS_Ban_PVP_desc:0 "Constantly criticising our regime at all points, committing treason by allowing foreign powers to station troops in our nation and their inability to cooperate with a fully constitutional system has left us no choice but to ban the party and make membership of any syndicalist party illegal."

COS_Found_ICE_desc:0 "Representing the culmination of over 50 years of finding an efficient way to provide electricity to the nation, the ICE is founded to modernise the nations struggling sector. Lack of effort by foreign based companies that controlled the sector for nearly 15 years has now prompted a national initiative to create a Costa Rican national company responsible for the creation and maintenance of our new electricity grid. Plans for new roads, power cables and hydro-electric dams such as Carrillos de Poás have already been drafted and are only awaiting the approval of the Council."

COS_Disband_the_Council_desc:0 "Founded during the early days of the Ferrer regime, the Council was tasked with the creation of a new modern constitution and to correctly handle the transition to the Second Republic. 815 reforms later, we see this task as finished and power will be transferred back to the electoral system which will decide on the new president."

COS_Abolish_Army_desc:0 "We should be an example to the rest of our world and show them that real progress is made in a parliament instead of on the battlefield.

COS_labour_conflicts_desc:0 "The United Fruit Company holds vast power in our nation's economy and has deep ties within the government. While the lingering American Depression has proven detrimental to their influence abroad, making way for increasing German trade, the company and its terrible labour practices have led to rising tensions in the political landscape. With elections just around the corner and socialism entrenching itself all around Central America, this could escalate without proper government intervention."

### Focuses ###
COS_ZKG_Bailout:0 "ZKG Bailout"
COS_ZKG_Bailout_desc:0 "Although founded by Costa Rican coffee farmers of German descent, the explosive growth of the German economy has led to the company being absorbed into a German multinational company, the ZKG. As this however tied the company to the German stock exchange, the fallout of the Black Monday disaster has had catastrophic consequences for the company who now edges on bankruptcy."
COS_Request_American_Support:0 "Request American Support"
COS_Request_American_Support_desc:0 "Even though the Americans themselves are suffering greatly from their own recession, various investors have shown interests in our land offering to assist the government in bailing out the ZKG in exchange for precious hectares of plantation land."
COS_UFC_Land_Acquisition:0 "UFC Land Acquisition"
COS_UFC_Land_Acquisition_desc:0 "Originally founded by Keith in Costa Rica back in the 19th century, the company no longer has our nation as its primary base of operations. The low cost of land now however caused by the governments policy to sell land cheaply to attract investors has once again attracted the UFC to increase its operations in our nation, further strengthened in their decision by the stability of our nation."
COS_Outproducing_the_Competition:0 "Outproducing the Competition"
COS_Outproducing_the_Competition_desc:0 "As demands for stable food supply routes increase across the world and several of the once 'Banana Republics' have descended into chaos, the access to bananas is decreasing rapidly making our nation an attractive investment and a steady supply of the delicious yellow fruit."
COS_Puerto_Limon_Expansion:0 "Puerto Limon Expansion"
COS_Puerto_Limon_Expansion_desc:0 "Located on the Atlantic side of our nation, Puerto Limon has long served as the central hub for the Banana export and has subsequently been expanded multiple times already by the UFC to meet increasing exports. Localising the production of freighters would be a wise investment as the American shipyards become less reliable by the day."
COS_Connecting_the_Plantations:0 "Connecting the Plantations"
COS_Connecting_the_Plantations_desc:0 "Railroads are no longer an abstract landscape decoration feature for the Costa Rican people who have seen the completion of multiple projects in their lifetime. The expansion of the plantations however caused by the new policy has left the rail magnates to play catch up. Inviting foreign investors to assist us in this could prove to be a big boon to our recovery."
COS_Withering_the_Storm:0 "Weathering the Storm"
COS_Withering_the_Storm_desc:0 "Our experience with the American recession in the 20's and the subsequent decisive economic policy of our President has enabled us to quite painlessly get over the recession. Jobs have been lost and empty bellies endured but compared to our neighbours we can proudly say that Costa Rica is prepared for the future."
COS_German_Crisis_Response:0 "German Crisis Response"
COS_German_Crisis_Response_desc:0 "It was the Germans who brought down our economy so it is only right that they are going to help us recover. This will come at a cost however as the hawkish investors of the Empire are sure to demand further land concessions in exchange for lower tarrifs and agreeable trade terms."
COS_Cash_Crops:0 "Cash Crops Investments"
COS_Cash_Crops_desc:0 "Coffee and Bananas are the motor of our economy and have brought us much wealth in the past. Surely further backing down on this will rescue the ZKG from imminent collapse whilst also providing a feeding bottom for new investments by drastically lowering the price of the plantation land."
COS_Deal_with_the_ZKG:0 "Deal with the ZKG"
COS_Deal_with_the_ZKG_desc:0 "As German investors have mostly backed out of the economy and sold their shares during the flurry of Black Monday, de facto ownership has returned to the original founders who hold the interests of our nation in higher regard than their oversea colleagues."
COS_Public_Works:0 "Public Works"
COS_Public_Works_desc:0 "Influenced by the economic policies of both Keynes in the United States and Schacht in the German Empire, the government has decreed a policy of massive public investments to keep the population employed and ensure a solid base for our economy to flourish on."
COS_Cultural_Growth:0 "Cultural Growth"
COS_Cultural_Growth_desc:0 "Many of our intellectuals have chosen to study in the nation of Flanders-Wallonia, more precise at the Catholic University of Leuven, and the continued partnership between the two has led to an increased interest by the Flemish-Wallonian people in our culture and traditions. Aware of our pride in our National Theatre, their government has shown willingness to fund its renovation and strengthen cultural ties."
COS_Mitteleuropan_Trade_Agreement:0 "Mitteleuropan Trade Agreement"
COS_Mitteleuropan_Trade_Agreement_desc:0 "Timid investments from the German companies has thusfar kept us from recovering fully but the terms of the new agreements drafted up by our government with the [REDACTED] have shown promise for both our citizens and the assets under control by our German allies."

COS_Industrial_Developement_Scheme:0 "Industrial Development Scheme"

COS_Expand_Textile_Industry:0 "Textile Industry"
COS_Expand_Textile_Industry_desc:0 "Although artisanal in nature, the textile industry of Costa Rica is renown across the region and has close ties to both American and German clothing companies. As the production for now however is solely located in small workshops, we hope to set up actual factories to increase our output drastically."
COS_Economic_Boom:0 "Economic Boom"

COS_Gold_Mining:0 "Dig Deeper"
COS_Gold_Mining_desc:0 "Located primarily on the Northern side of our country, the old Spanish gold mines are nearing depletion. As they haven't been a major part of our economy for decades, prospecting for new sites has always been postponed. The collapse of the coffee market has made the government realise that diversifying the economy is key and has led to prospectors getting invitations to examine the surface of our nation."
COS_Foreign_Knowhow:0 "Foreign Know-how"
COS_Foreign_Knowhow_desc:0 "Our nation has thus far lacked adequate higher education which has led to many of the upper class studying abroad, with a certain preference to the universities of Flanders-Wallonia. Instead of letting our citizens travel abroad for education, we should encourage foreign teachers to come to Costa Rica and assist us in the creation of our own higher education system."
COS_Manufacturing_Industry:0 "Foundations of a Manufacturing Industry"
COS_Manufacturing_Industry_desc:0 "Limited to the production of farming tools and small products for domestic use, our manufacturing industry is in dire need of state intervention. Thousands of small workshops exist across the nation but the connection between these producers and their customers has thus far only been determined by their location. By steering the economy with a heavy hand, the state hopes to centralise production."
COS_Escuela_Metalica:0 "Escuela Metalica"
COS_Escuela_Metalica_desc:0 "Serving as the Headquarters of the Escuela Buenaventura Corrales, the school is one of the oldest education facilities in the nation, a symbol of great pride and a testament to the industrialisation of our nation. Inspired by the design of the Eiffel Tower, it was designed and built in Belgium by Charles Thirrion and then transported by ship to Costa Rica where it was reassembled in front of the Morazán Park."
COS_Heavy_Industry:0 "Heavy Industrial Expansion"

COS_A_Different_Approach_desc:0 "As smoke stacks and dark clouds mark the skyline of the industrialised nation, we as Costa Ricans should take pride in our natural beauty and stay away from the temptations of mass production.

COS_Tourism_Industry:0 "Promote Tourism"

COS_Boost_Cash_Crops:0 "Boost Cash Crops"
COS_Boost_Cash_Crops_desc:0 "Cash crops have served us well for generations and are far cleaner and less demanding on our people than the work in mines and factories. Further contracts with the ZKG and UFC should help us further expand the export economy whilst keeping our nation clear from the taint of industrialisation."
COS_Small_Business:0 "Small Business"
COS_Small_Business_desc:0 "Contrary to most Central American nations, Costa Rica has a well-developed manufacturing industry and is quickly expanding this sector across the nation. Over 7000 of these little "factories" exist and while they do it somewhat ineffiecently, they still sustain the needs of our population, while also providing valuable trade goods to our neighbours."
COS_Hydro_Elelectricity:0 "Hydro-Electricity"

COS_Paving_the_way_to_the_future_desc:0 "The rest of the world may not yet have realised that the constant greed and exploitation of mother nature will one day force them to pay the price, but here in Costa Rica, efforts to strive for symbiosis between man and nature are conducted at every corner. We can only hope that others soon realise the same thing..."

COS_Educational_Reforms:0 "Educational Reforms"
COS_Educational_Reforms_desc:0 "With the spirit "Costa Rica has more teachers than soldiers" in mind, neglecting the education policy would be last on our agenda. As the last major education reform dates back to the 19th century when the Catholic missions had to make way for a secular system, little has changed leading to both our curricula and infrastructure starting to show cracks."
COS_Cement_Administration:0 "Cement Administration"
COS_Cement_Administration_desc:0 "Whilst Castro may not be liked by everyone due to his strict and severe punishments, one cannot deny that the efficiency and reliability of the civil service has leapt lightyears ahead of what it was before his presidency.

COS_Adapt_the_Constitution:0 "Adapt the Constitution"
COS_Adapt_the_Constitution_desc:0 "As outlined by the Costa Rican constitution, presidents are not allowed to immediately serve a second term after their first one is over.

COS_Iron_Bars_Presidency_desc:0 "Nicknamed the President of Iron Bars, Castro has received the cognomen due to his massive investments in infrastructural expansion and the reinvigoration of our more backwards regions.

COS_La_Sabana_International:0 "La Sabana International"

COS_Railroad_Expansion:0 "Railroad Expansion"
COS_Railroad_Expansion_desc:0 "Until now the vast majority of our railroads were constructed by foreign contractors in exchange for acres of plantation land. The unreliability of the global market however and the rapid decline in American stability has prompted the government to take decisive action and focus on training technicians and construction workers able to do the work without foreign assistance."
COS_Bananas_South_Pacific:0 "Banana Plantations in the South Pacific"
COS_Bananas_South_Pacific_desc:0 "Due to the focus of the UFC on the Atlantic coast and the region around Puerto Limon, development of the Pacific Coast has been lacking for decades now with plantations on this side of the nation working far less efficient and suffering due to a lack of infrastructure. By cooperating with the UFC, we hope to attract more investments to this region and combat the rising poverty."

COS_Socialist_Victory:0 "Socialist Victory"
COS_Socialist_Victory_desc:0 "Although coming as a surprise to many, close friends and associates of Calderon saw this "sudden" change in policy from far away. Influenced by his studies at the Catholic University of Leuven, the Doctor has taken a great liking to the Papal "Rerum Novarum" and has seen in it the solution to the fallacies of capitalism and a viable alternative to the radical syndicalism that has taken over the world."
COS_Break_Coffee_Elite:0 "Break Coffee Elite"
COS_Break_Coffee_Elite_desc:0 "For decades now Costa Rican politics have been indirectly controlled by a small minority of wealthy coffee barons who have dictated the policy of the nation through the PRN. It is their influence that we will need to rid ourselves of if we want to stand any chance at fully implementing our social program."
COS_Develop_Atlantic_Region:0 "Develop Atlantic Region"
COS_Develop_Atlantic_Region_desc:0 "One of the major issues in Costa Rica is the very limited diet the average citizen consumes which leads to a great deficit of protein. Therefore the president has decided to kill two birds with one stone and plans to increase subsidies for the coastal region on the Atlantic, boost the fishing industry and distribute seafood to the interior of the nation."
COS_Introduce_Work_Code:0 "Introduce Work Code"
COS_Introduce_Work_Code_desc:0 "The main pillar of Calderons policy, the Labour code comes as a reaction to the mounting labour conflicts between employer and employee.

COS_Diversify_the_Economy_desc:0 "Even though we have made massive headway in the development of our social system, the economy has taken a massive hit and is groaning under the weight of these new expenditures.

COS_Nationalise_Banks_desc:0 "To relieve the crushing poverty and deprivation of the rural population, Don Pepe has formulated a plan in which the public sector would be financed by profits from state-owned enterprises, and the private sector would be financed by state banking. State-owned capitalist enterprises would be founded and their profits would return to the national treasury to finance infrastructure projects."
COS_Women_Suffrage:0 "Women Suffrage"
COS_Women_Suffrage_desc:0 "Suffragette movements have long been clamouring for government recognition in Costa Rica and whilst the previous administration made some promises to integrate women in the electoral process, nothing really came from it.

COS_Expand_Citizenship:0 "Expand Citizenship"
COS_Expand_Citizenship_desc:0 "Friction between the native Costa Rican population and the black immigrants on the Atlantic coast has long caused issues in our society as the latter were never fully recognised as Costa Rican citizens but more as a labour force for the American plantations.

cos.1.d:0 "Tucked away deep in the Central American jungles, our small but proud nation has flourished for many decades enjoying literacy rates higher than some European nations and a slow but steadily growing economy based on the banana and especially coffee trade.\n\nEnsured by a strict adherence of all parties to the constitution, there has been no military intervention or political coup in the nation since the failed dictatorship of Ticino in 1917 who was deposed mere months later under pressure from the people, refusing to endure a dictator in their republic. Ever since the nation has been controlled by a varied albeit egalitarian caste of politicians who have enjoyed the fruits of the growing German economy and the close ties between our two nations.\n\nUnder the wing of the PRN, president Ricardo Jiminez is able to look back on a successful term in which he dealt with both the economic depression caused by the American recession and the rising voices of socialist movements who enthused by the Atlantic Workers Congress have finally risen up from their slumber and demanded better representation. Although they somewhat succeeded in their aims and have forced the government to draft a labour accord, the law is far from passed yet and under the rising star of Manual Mora Valverde trouble between companies and workers is far from over.\n\nNevertheless, the nation flourishes as the fruits of our relations with Mitteleuropa are flowing in in the form of cultural exchange programs, scientific assistance and a strong bond between universities such as the KU Leuven in Flanders-Wallonia and the Costa Rican upper class."
cos.1.a:0 "Another sunny day in Costa Rica."

cos.2.d:0 "Whilst the supremacy of the PRN is unquestionable in the upcoming elections, the party is divided on who to push forward to serve as their Presidential candidate.\n\nLeón Cortés Castro has the support of the conservative coffee elite and has proven during the tenure of Jimenez to be a worthy successor to his legacy. Other members however have remarked that his aggressive anti-socialist stance and strict attitude could lead to further escalation amidst the socialist sphere and as such provide a feeding bottom for Valverdes syndicalist party.\n\nAs a compromise between the two extremes, the Church persuaded by the encyclical Rerum Novarum, has pushed forward Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia. His political career is not very noteworthy and most people only know him as the 'Doctor' due to his medical profession. With both sides hoping to use him as a sock puppet whilst ruling in his stead, support for his candidacy is increasing by the day."

Careful spending by our former president has luckily allowed our government to build up a small reserve with which we will now attempt to stop the down-spiraling catastrophe that has hit the ZKG.

Weary of outsiders in their land however, the Costa Ricans never fully embraced their new citizens and kept a distinct distance from them. Over the years this has led to friction between the two parties which only escaped escalation due to the geographical features keeping them apart.\n\nFaltering profits from the coffee trade however and a general consciousness amongst the negro population have let the two groups once more collide.

### COTO Events ###
cos.30.t:0 "Crisis over Coto!"
cos.30.d:0 "Ever since the independence of Panama from Spain, they have laid claim to over the Coto, a region in Panama's Chiriquí Province along the Panamanian-Costa Rican border. In 1911 the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Edward D. White, was asked to arbitrate. He rendered his decision in 1914, but Panama did not accept it, alleging that it favored Costa Rica. Hostilities broke out in 1921, when Costa Rica invaded the area. Panama recaptured the area easily. The conflict spread, however, when Costa Rica moved into the province of Bocas del Toro. Fearing that its interests might be threatened, the United States forced Panama to accept the White decision.\n\nAs our American allies have now fallen into anarchy, the Panamanian government has reopened the dispute and is demanding that we hand over the territory or face their army on the battlefield. Whilst our troops have recently grown in size, we are still completely outmatched by our Panamanian neighbours and will need foreign assistance if we are to become victorious.\n\nOur allies however are less eager to fight yet another pointless war and would prefer a more diplomatic solution to the crisis by re-enforcing the Fallo White ruling and forcing Panama to back down once and for all."

Fearing that its interests might be threatened, the United States forced Panama to accept the White decision.\n\nWell aware that the Americans are in no position to save Costa Rica once more, the Panama government has sent another ultimatum to San Jose demanding the extradition of the Coto region.

cos.59.t:0 "National Strike"
cos.59.d:0 "Whilst [COS.GetLeader]'s austerity policy has started to improve economic disaster of last year and new trade agreements with foreign powers have brought in shipments of food for the malnourished population, the continued pressure from the cash crop companies to produce more and more has brought the Costa Rican people once more to the breaking point. Demanding new and better laws have ultimately culminated in the creation of the so-called Collective agreement between the workers and the companies responsible. No response has been granted yet by spokesmen of the companies but many fear that they will once again send in hit squads to pressure the workers into submission."
cos.59.a:0 "Troubling news."

cos.60.t:0 "Foundation of "Trabaio""
cos.60.d:0 "Feeling under threat by what they call the "bourgeois press", the Syndicalist party has announced the creation of a new newspaper to distribute their world-views and spread propaganda with. Hoping that through sales and advertising the newspaper will also become a source of income for the struggling party, they have ironically turned their paper in a cacophony of both ads praising the virtues of capitalism and articles harshly criticizing this same practice. How hilarious the situation however may be, [COS.GetLeader] is all but pleased that somebody dares threaten his image and has already announced countermeasures against the newspaper should they continue to protest his regime."
cos.60.a:0 "Officially slander the paper and demand they cease printing."
cos.60.b:0 "Let the hypocrites enjoy their moment of fame!"

cos.61.t:0 "Signature of the Collective Agreement between Workers"
cos.61.d:0 "Years have passed since the Great Banana Strike of 1934 but the Costa Rican people have pushed on against the UFC. As the situation in the USA went from bad to catastrophe, the UFC saw that would they not cooperate with the local population their time in the nation may be coming to an end. Finally agreeing on many of the labour concerns pressed by the syndicalist Manuel Mora, the company was backed into a corner whilst the government refused to assist them in the matter.\n\nAchieving minimum wages that would not be given in company coupons, six hour shifts, recognition of injury law and many other concessions, this is a great success for the Costa Rican left and has also led to the creation of the first actual trade unions, expanding where the Atlantic Workers Congress had laid the foundations.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, the ZKG has also ratified the new Labour Accord and has expressed their full desire to work with the workers to create a better and safer work environment"
cos.61.a:0 "A success for all parties involved...except the stocks."

cos.62.t:0 "Regulation of the Press"
cos.62.d:0 "Even though "Trabaio" has seen little success in capturing the minds of its readers, other newspapers have started to write about our regime in a bad light. Whilst it is their constitutional right to have the freedom to express their opinions, we feel that they could be...motivated to direct their attention elsewhere.\n\nThe success of the Labour Accord has sadly brought with it the rise of further far left media who openly oppose our regime and are calling for a "Revolution", surely the people must see that this is treason of the highest degree?"
cos.62.a:0 "Leave the Press alone."
cos.62.b:0 "Strong-arm the papers into submission and arrest the troublemakers."

cos.63.t:0 "Jewish Refugees request permission to settle"
cos.63.d:0 "As antisemitism continues to rise in the AUS break-away and due to the increasing tension in the Middle East between the Ottoman Empire and the Egyptian nation, an American humanitarian organisation called Refugee Economic Management has asked our government to open ourselves up to 1500 Jewish families who have been driven from their homes. Guaranteeing [COS.GetLeader] that the resettlement procedure would not cost the state a penny, they are urging the government to set a side a small parcel of land for them build a Jewish community."
cos.63.a:0 "Jews are propagators of socialism! Away with them!"

cos.64.d:0 "The war in the United States seems to have no end in sight and whilst many are dying on the front-lines of the various American battlegrounds, many more are attempting to escape the nation hoping for a safe place until the war has ended. Our renown reputation as one of the most democratic and accepting nations in the Caribbean region has made us an attractive destination and has prompted thousands to embark on cargo freighters towards our little state. Accepting these immigrants will lead to an increased amount of capital in the nation but tensions are already running high between the Native Costa Ricans and the black Jamaican population. Further immigration may lead to open conflict if we are not careful."
cos.64.a:0 "Accept them with open arms."
cos.64.b:0 "We are full, go try somewhere else!"

cos.65.t:0 "1938 Regional Elections"
cos.65.d:0 "Whilst some have appreciated the heavy handed interventionism by [COS.GetLeader], not everyone is equally content and with the Regional Elections approaching, the popularity of the PRN is tanking heavily in the polls. Especially the syndicalist PVP under Manuel Mora Valverde is making decent headway and seems set to deliver congressmen like Carlos Luis Sáenz this time around. In these trying times it's key that our resolve remains unshaken and therefore president [COS.GetLeader] is secretly planning to lift the syndicalists from office the moment they are elected and arrest them on charges of treason."

cos.68.d:0 "Constructed in the late 19th century, when San Jose's population was only around 19,000 people with the money earned during the coffee boom, the Teatro Nacional has long served as one of the prime institutes of high-quality musical and theatrical performances in Central America. Waning interest by the people however and a lack of homegrown plays suited for the prestige of the building however have left it in a somewhat neglected state.\n\nThat was until a company of Flemish-Wallonian investors travelling through the nation during a trade mission sent out by Mitteleuropa came upon the site, instantly falling in love with the institution. Promising to send aid and performers from their homeland, the Teatro has received a sizeable grant to continue its operations with. When a recent reportage was subsequently featured in the Flemish-Wallonian paper De Standaard, a public crowdfunding campaign to support the Teatro was started with great success across their nation.\n\nPresented today by the Ambassador from Mitteleuropa, a small ceremony was held in front of the building in which the grant was symbolically exchanged for a bag of Costa Rican coffee beans."

Influenced by the Peruvian political thinker Victor Raúl Haya de la Torre, the young intellectuals believed that the state should be an instrument for enacting radical social reform. They are frustrated by the failures of Cortes' administrations to address social issues and applaud the Atlantic Workers Congress for pushing back against the UFC. Fearing syndicalism, El Centro members believe that social reforms could be achieved through the legislative framework."

Reactions from the left have thus far been very warm as they hope that infighting within the PRN will allow them to take control in the upcoming elections. Cortes himself is all but pleased and has been seen secretly planning with his party members to sabotage the Jimenez campaign."

cos.72.d:0 ""Dear Costa Ricans and other people living in our great nation. I speak to you with a heavy heart as I see the values for which our republic has fought so bravely are being tarnished at every end. The constitution, once the sacred fundament of our society has been spit on by our most enlightened president. The freedom of speech we once prided ourselves on is ripped to shreds by the censure of Castros regime and the man in the street is lied to and oppressed. Where one day, addressing the government openly and criticizing its failing policies was seen as virtuous and right, it is now a direct path to jail. How long Costa Ricans will you endure the dictator? How many more of our civil liberties need to be removed before we realize that the man in the Presidential Palace does not speak for us?"\n\nContinuing preaching for over half an hour, the distinguished businessman was finally removed from the air by police forces and arrested for treason. The damage however is done and police forces across San Jose are wondering how the situation should be handled. Punishing Ferrer severly will only make him a martyr while others fear that releasing him will allow him to gather further support against the government."

cos.76.d:0 "700 armed loyalists of Ferrer were all it took to flawlessly execute a coup d'etat on the regime of [COS.GetLeader]. Taking the key cities of Puerto Limon, Cartago and San José, the under-supplied and understaffed forces of the national army were in no position to offer much resistance. Small shootouts occurred throughout the nation but in the end, the coup was executed without much blood spilled.\n\nProclaiming himself president of the nation, Figueres Ferrer has taken control into his own hands and has already announced sweeping changes."

cos.77.d:0 "As is tradition, the new president was asked to give a speech during his ceremony lining out his plans for the future of our nation. What people however didn't expect the radical turn of policy Calderon announced.\n\nCalderón proposes sweeping social reforms, promising to found a national university, develop a social security program, provide low-cost housing, provide more rural credit, enact land reform, and assist less-developed regions of the country. All of these announcements have completely stunned the members of the PRN who saw in Calderon nothing but a sock puppet for their conservative policy."
cos.77.a:0 "H-he can't do this!"

cos.78.t:0 "Education Reform"
cos.78.d:0 "Ever since liberal reforms back in 1884 and 1894 put a stop to the catholic influence in our education program, the nation has prided itself on having an advanced level of literacy. "Costa Rica has more teachers than soldiers" is one of the favorite ways a Costa Rican describes his country and this pride is deeply nested.\n\nThat is until now as President Calderon has recently announced dramatic changes to primary and secondary education based on his inspiration source, the Papal encyclical "Rerum Novarum". "religion should be obeyed; that a high standard of morality should prevail, both in public and private life." Based on these ideas, Calderon not only reverted the 1894 ban on teachers from monastic orders but even obligated parents who want their child excluded from Catholic teachings to personally deliver a written not to the teacher, by doing so making children who use such notes be seen as "special" and laughing stocks for the others."

Though many leaders had placed family members in positions of power, Calderón's brother has become infamous for doling out non-competitive government contracts to cronies and people who pay him bribes. This has led him to acquire the nickname “Paco a Medias” because allegedly he demands a 50% kickback up front before offering contracts.\n\nEven though Calderon announced himself as a president of the people for the people, the economic mismanagement of his nation and the catastrophic increase in corruption are weighing heavily on the nation."

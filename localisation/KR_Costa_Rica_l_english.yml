### Leaders ###
POLITICS_RICARDO_JIMENEZ_OREAMUNO_DESC:0 "The son of two-time president Jesús Jiménez Zamora, Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno rose to prominence before the Weltkrieg. In his first term as president between 1910 and 1914, he oversaw the repayment of the country's crippling national debt. By his third stint as president, the country's national debt had again skyrocketed, and again President Jiménez attempted, less successfully than before, to bring Costa Rica back from the brink of default.\nLooking forward, Jiménez fears that without a principled hand to guide it, Costa Rican democracy could be hijacked by foreign economic interests. Perhaps though he wishes to retire from politics, such fears will ensure his continued presence."
POLITICS_COUNCIL_COS_DESC:0 "With great political disruption at hand, a mostly conservative Council of Ministers has been appointed collectively act as both head of state and government while national affairs are sorted."

### Decisions ###
COS_ZKG_decisions:0 "Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft"
COS_ZKG_decisions_desc:0 "Our nation is almost fully controlled by a select elite of Coffee barons. Due to the American depression and the subsequent shockwaves, many of these barons with German roots have bound together and have created the §YZentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft§! or §YZKG§!. Their power is large but could also be used to our advantage should we play our cards right.\n\nInfluence of the §YZKG§! : £coffee_texticon [?party_popularity@authoritarian_democrat|%R0]\n"

COS_Combat_Social_Inequality:0 "Combat Social Inequality"
COS_Combat_Social_Inequality_desc:0 "Even though the Atlantic Workers Congress has fought hard to secure the little rights plantation workers now have, the great divide between the wealthy German Coffee Barons and the common men remains great. Further social concessions will help us improve the life of the man on the street and also reduce the pull of these companies on political affairs."
COS_German_Cultural_Program:0 "German Cultural Exchange Program"
COS_German_Cultural_Program_desc:0 "Strong ties between our nation and the members of the German sphere in Europe has led to a great influx of art, literary works and an exchange of cultural heritage. Universities all across Germany and Flanders-Wallonia are also responsible for the better part of our highly educated populace and have drastically influenced the minds of our people."
COS_Extend_Loan_decision:0 "Extend our Loans"
COS_Extend_Loan_decision_desc:0 "Happily profiting from the lingering depression and now from the Black Monday catastrophe, investors and wealthy capitalists have loaned us the capital necessary to bail out the ZKG. Now these loan sharks are returning for the money we no longer have. Offering them small political concessions and selling some of our land to these individuals could mitigate the issue but will not serve as a permanent solution."
COS_Sell_Government_Land_decision:0 "Sell off Government Land"
COS_Sell_Government_Land_decision_desc:0 "For decades the governments of Central America have used foreign companies to back up their economies through the sales of vast swathes of plantation land. It is only right that we do so as well, no?"
COS_Land_Survey:0 "Survey the Acquired Land"
COS_Land_Survey_desc:0 "Whilst large portions of our nation are ideal for plantations, not all of them are suited for the Coffee production. Scouting out terrain and determining whether or not it is worth the price we're asking for it is therefore key to the success of their investment."
COS_Extend_Connections:0 "Extend Railroad Connections"
COS_Extend_Connections_desc:0 "As the plantations keep growing and industry starts to foster, the need for better infrastructure increases as well. Following the example of Keith in the 19th Century, the ZKG has offered to extend the railroads if we are to sufficiently compensate them with workable plantation land."
COS_Hire_Foreign_Engineers:0 "Hire Foreign Engineers"
COS_Hire_Foreign_Engineers_desc:0 "Small mineral reserves have been discovered during the construction of the railroad and have prompted the ZKG to hire European Engineers to investigate the viability of these deposits and to further assist in the construction of bridges and tunnels."
COS_Plantation_Expansion:0 "Expand the ZKG Plantations"
COS_Plantation_Expansion_desc:0 "Positive response by both the company itself and other investors plus a rapid response from our government has led to an agreement concerning the new plantations. Promising to rely on mostly native Costa Rican labour and accepting the demands of the Atlantic Workers Congress, all parties involved have come to a suitable agreement and the first hectares of land have been put in action."

COS_UFC_decisions:0 "United Fruit Company"
COS_UFC_decisions_desc:0 "Ever since the American Keith set foot in Costa Rica and received the contract to establish a railroad network in our nation, his company the §YUnited Fruit Company§! or §YUFC§! has played an important role in Costa Rican economics. The great success of the company however did not solely remain Costa Rican and through shrewd investment the company has established a network of subsidiaries and plantations all across the Caribbean, bringing great fortune to these nations but also causing massive social disruption, often leading to §Rstrikes§!, §Rviolence§! and §Rpolitical disaster§!.\n\nInfluence of the §YUFC§! : £banana_texticon [?party_popularity@market_liberal|%R0]\n"

COS_Sell_Government_Land_UFC_decision:0 "Sell Government Land to the UFC"
COS_Sell_Government_Land_UFC_decision_desc:0 "For decades the governments of Central America have used foreign companies to back up their economies through the sales of vast swathes of plantation land. It is only right that we do so as well, no?"
COS_Build_New_Telephone_Lines:0 "Commission new Telegraph Lines"
COS_Build_New_Telephone_Lines_desc:0 "Communication between the two sides of our nation has always been a tricky affair often leading to miscommunication or unchecked corruption. Using their influence and expertise in the trade, the UFC has offered to expand our telegraph network in exchange for further concessions and the promise that we won't object to their Jamaican migrant workers."
COS_Establish_UFC_Headquarters_decision:0 "Establish UFC Headquarters in Puerto Limon"
COS_Establish_UFC_Headquarters_decision_desc:0 "As America descends into chaos and the individual nation states of Central America smell their chance to escape from the UFC monopoly, the company has proposed to expand their offices in Costa Rica and to establish Limon as their operational Headquarters for the Caribbean Region."
COS_Limon_Bananas:0 "Develop Banana Plantations in Limon"
COS_Limon_Bananas_desc:0 "Originally handed over to the UFC when Keith first started the company in exchange for the construction of a railroad across our nation, the Banana boom has struck the region and completely transformed it. Thousands of black Jamaican workers have been imported to work in the plantations and repeated sales of government land to the company have developed the region into an important economic hub, further aided by the key Puerto Limon harbour."
COS_Jamaica_Sugar:0 "Develop Sugar Plantations in Jamaica"
COS_Jamaica_Sugar_desc:0 "First operating under the West India Interest in the 18th Century and later fusing with the present-day West Indies Federation, the island of Jamaica has always been one of the main exporters of Sugar to the European Continent. Large investments by the British and extensive use of slavery exponentially increased the amount of sugar plantations on the island during much of its initial history and still leaves his mark on the nation as sugar remains its primary export.\n\nInvestors from the UFC have also shown interest in these rich plantations and have slowly but surely started buying land on the island to increase their own profit."
COS_Jamaica_Bananas:0 "Develop Banana Plantations in Jamaica"
COS_Jamaica_Bananas_desc:0 "Founded by a sailor called Lorenzo Dow Baker in 1870, the Boston Fruit Company was the start of the UFC operations on the island. Later merging with the company of Keith, the United Fruit Company started its rise to power and became one of the largest employers on the island. Continued growth of our operations in Jamaica should therefore be critical and have our priority when planning our next step."
COS_Cuba_Sugar:0 "Develop Sugar Plantations in Cuba"
COS_Cuba_Sugar_desc:0 "Mainly situated in the Oriente Province of the nation, the holdings of the UFC on Cuba aren't as influential to the nations politics as they are elsewhere in the region. Multiple sugar mills however exist on the island and it would be in our best interest and that of the company to keep these afloat."
COS_Honduras_Palm_Oil:0 "Develop Palm Plantations in Honduras"
COS_Honduras_Palm_Oil_desc:0 "Assisting in the military coup overthrowing president Davila and reinstating general Bonilla, Samuel Zemurray was able to extract massive concessions from the government of the nation. Offering to build up the infrastructure in the nation in exchange for enormous swathes of land, his company not only profiled itself as the motor of the Honduran economy but has since then branched out across the region before fusing together with the UFC.\n\nThe latter now not only holds great interests in the Banana production but is also responsible for sizable amounts of Palm Oil and Abaca"
COS_Honduras_Abaca:0 "Develop Abaca Plantations in Honduras"
COS_Honduras_Abaca_desc:0 "Assisting in the military coup overthrowing president Davila and reinstating general Bonilla, Samuel Zemurray was able to extract massive concessions from the government of the nation. Offering to build up the infrastructure in the nation in exchange for enormous swathes of land, his company not only profiled itself as the motor of the Honduran economy but has since then branched out across the region before fusing together with the UFC.\n\nThe latter now not only holds great interests in the Banana production but is also responsible for sizable amounts of Palm Oil and Abaca"

COS_Guatemala_Abaca:0 "Develop Abaca Plantations in Guatemala"
COS_Guatemala_Abaca_desc:0 "Not only does the UFC control a sizeable percentage of all Guatemalan land but it also owns schools, railroads, housing companies and much more. To say the Guatemalan economy depends on the UFC would be an understatement and we can not let this influence falter for the safety of the company.\n\nMainly situated on the Eastern flank of the nation close to Honduras, the Abaca lands are providing a valuable alternative to the otherwise Banana dominated operations of the company."
COS_Guatemala_Banana:0 "Develop Banana Plantations in Guatemala"
COS_Guatemala_Banana_desc:0 "Not only does the UFC control a sizeable percentage of all Guatemalan land but it also owns schools, railroads, housing companies and much more. To say the Guatemalan economy depends on the UFC would be an understatement and we cannot let this influence falter for the safety of the company.\n\nMainly situated on the Western flank of the nation, the Banana plantations of Guatemala are the company's most successful operation yet and are not only contributing to continued growth of the stocks but are also allowing the UFC to branch out across the Caribbean and even into South America."
COS_Colombia_Banana:0 "Develop Banana Plantations in Colombia"
COS_Colombia_Banana_desc:0 "Centered around important Banana regions such as Magdalena, the company has had a troubled history in the South American nation. Various strikes, violent escalations between the workers and strikebreakers of the UFC have shaped the nation and the company is struggling to hold on to these assets with the American Civil War ravaging all in its path."
COS_Nicaragua_Palm_Oil:0 "Develop Palm Plantations in Nicaragua"

COS_Market_decisions:0 "Global Trade"
COS_Market_decisions_desc:0 "As nations all across the globe have started to drastically increase their weapons industry smelling an opportunity to make a profit, we have the resources to particapate in this trade as well.\n\nUFC Profit : §Y[?COS.cos_profit_factor]§!\n"

With a heavy focus on following the "Rerum Novarum" and adapting it to Costa Rican society, he has outlined multiple programs to aid the common man and solve the country's largest issues caused by §Rpoverty§! and §Rbad sanitation§!."

COS_Combat_Footworm:0 "Combat Footworm in the Lowlands"
COS_Combat_Footworm_desc:0 "Nearly 70% of the population in the Lowlands suffers from the Footworm disease. As a doctor himself, our president has proposed a program wherein all children in the first grade will be given shoes by the state and the medical supplies necessary to rid ourselves of the problem."
COS_Stimulate_Fishing_Industry:0 "Stimulate Fishing Industry"
COS_Stimulate_Fishing_Industry_desc:0 "One of the major issues in Costa Rica is the very limited diet the average citizen consumes which leads to a great deficit of protein. Therefore the president has decided to kill two birds with one stone and plans to increase subsidies for the coastal region, boost the fishing industry and distribute seafood to the interior of the nation."
COS_Disband_Petroleum_Monopoly:0 "Disband the Petroleum Monopoly"
COS_Disband_Petroleum_Monopoly_desc:0 "Around 10 years ago, the entire gasoline and petroleum sector of our nation came under control of a single national company.

COS_Infrastructural_Improvements:0 "Infrastructural Improvements"
COS_Infrastructural_Improvements_desc:0 "As the majority of our shipping takes place in the Limon region, the Pacific coast has been fairly neglected by previous administrations. To combat this issue, the president has decreed that in cooperation with companies like the UFC the port towns of the Pacific will be further connected to the rest of the nation and new docks will be created."
COS_Silence_the_Press:0 "Silence the Press"
COS_Silence_the_Press_desc:0 "Whilst we carry freedom of speech as one of our proudest values, the increased presence of syndicalist propaganda and the continued slandering of the Cortes administration is becoming troublesome and has greatly angered the president who is already struggling to keep the nation together due to the economic collapse. Silencing a few newspapers like "Trabaio" could mitigate the issue perhaps"
COS_Expand_Manufacturing_Industry:0 "Expand the Manufacturing Industry"
COS_Expand_Manufacturing_Industry_desc:0 "Contrary to most Central American nations, Costa Rica has a well-developed manufacturing industry and is quickly expanding this sector across the nation. The main issue with these businesses is that they greatly lack in size which makes them inefficient on a national scale. Fusing some of our over 7000 little "factories" will greatly help us reduce this inefficiency and will prepare ourselves for more sorts of heavy industry."

COS_Tribunal_Probidad_desc:0 "Created under Decree No. 41, this law has ordered the formation of a tribunal in which we shall persecute the corruption of members of the old regime and decide whether or not we should seize their assets for the state.\n\nContaining the names of 209 people, the new Tribunal will track down the financial affairs of these people starting 8 years ago and working themselves up till the present day."

COS_Ban_PVP:0 "Ban the PVP"
COS_Ban_PVP_desc:0 "Constantly criticising our regime at all points, committing treason by allowing foreign powers to station troops in our nation and their inability to cooperate with a fully constitutional system has left us no choice but to ban the party and make membership of any syndicalist party illegal."

COS_Found_ICE_desc:0 "Representing the culmination of over 50 years of finding an efficient way to provide electricity to the nation, the ICE is founded to modernise the nations struggling sector. Lack of effort by foreign based companies that controlled the sector for nearly 15 years has now prompted a national initiative to create a Costa Rican national company responsible for the creation and maintenance of our new electricity grid. Plans for new roads, power cables and hydro-electric dams such as Carrillos de Poás have already been drafted and are only awaiting the approval of the Council."

COS_Disband_the_Council_desc:0 "Founded during the early days of the Ferrer regime, the Council was tasked with the creation of a new modern constitution and to correctly handle the transition to the Second Republic. 815 reforms later, we see this task as finished and power will be transferred back to the electoral system which will decide on the new president."

COS_Abolish_Army_desc:0 "We should be an example to the rest of our world and show them that real progress is made in a parliament instead of on the battlefield.

COS_labour_conflicts_desc:0 "The United Fruit Company holds vast power in our nation's economy and has deep ties within the government. While the lingering American Depression has proven detrimental to their influence abroad, making way for increasing German trade, the company and its terrible labour practices have led to rising tensions in the political landscape. With elections just around the corner and socialism entrenching itself all around Central America, this could escalate without proper government intervention."

### Focuses ###
COS_ZKG_Bailout:0 "ZKG Bailout"
COS_ZKG_Bailout_desc:0 "Although founded by Costa Rican coffee farmers of German descent, the explosive growth of the German economy has led to the company being absorbed into a German multinational company, the ZKG. As this however tied the company to the German stock exchange, the fallout of the Black Monday disaster has had catastrophic consequences for the company who now edges on bankruptcy."
COS_Request_American_Support:0 "Request American Support"
COS_Request_American_Support_desc:0 "Even though the Americans themselves are suffering greatly from their own recession, various investors have shown interests in our land offering to assist the government in bailing out the ZKG in exchange for precious hectares of plantation land."
COS_UFC_Land_Acquisition:0 "UFC Land Acquisition"
COS_UFC_Land_Acquisition_desc:0 "Originally founded by Keith in Costa Rica back in the 19th century, the company no longer has our nation as its primary base of operations. The low cost of land now however caused by the governments policy to sell land cheaply to attract investors has once again attracted the UFC to increase its operations in our nation, further strengthened in their decision by the stability of our nation."
COS_Outproducing_the_Competition:0 "Outproducing the Competition"
COS_Outproducing_the_Competition_desc:0 "As demands for stable food supply routes increase across the world and several of the once 'Banana Republics' have descended into chaos, the access to bananas is decreasing rapidly making our nation an attractive investment and a steady supply of the delicious yellow fruit."
COS_Puerto_Limon_Expansion:0 "Puerto Limon Expansion"
COS_Puerto_Limon_Expansion_desc:0 "Located on the Atlantic side of our nation, Puerto Limon has long served as the central hub for the Banana export and has subsequently been expanded multiple times already by the UFC to meet increasing exports. Localising the production of freighters would be a wise investment as the American shipyards become less reliable by the day."
COS_Connecting_the_Plantations:0 "Connecting the Plantations"
COS_Connecting_the_Plantations_desc:0 "Railroads are no longer an abstract landscape decoration feature for the Costa Rican people who have seen the completion of multiple projects in their lifetime. The expansion of the plantations however caused by the new policy has left the rail magnates to play catch up. Inviting foreign investors to assist us in this could prove to be a big boon to our recovery."
COS_Withering_the_Storm:0 "Weathering the Storm"
COS_Withering_the_Storm_desc:0 "Our experience with the American recession in the 20's and the subsequent decisive economic policy of our President has enabled us to quite painlessly get over the recession. Jobs have been lost and empty bellies endured but compared to our neighbours we can proudly say that Costa Rica is prepared for the future."
COS_German_Crisis_Response:0 "German Crisis Response"
COS_German_Crisis_Response_desc:0 "It was the Germans who brought down our economy so it is only right that they are going to help us recover. This will come at a cost however as the hawkish investors of the Empire are sure to demand further land concessions in exchange for lower tarrifs and agreeable trade terms."
COS_Cash_Crops:0 "Cash Crops Investments"
COS_Cash_Crops_desc:0 "Coffee and Bananas are the motor of our economy and have brought us much wealth in the past. Surely further backing down on this will rescue the ZKG from imminent collapse whilst also providing a feeding bottom for new investments by drastically lowering the price of the plantation land."
COS_Deal_with_the_ZKG:0 "Deal with the ZKG"

COS_Public_Works:0 "Public Works"
COS_Public_Works_desc:0 "Influenced by the economic policies of both Keynes in the United States and Schacht in the German Empire, the government has decreed a policy of massive public investments to keep the population employed and ensure a solid base for our economy to flourish on."
COS_Cultural_Growth:0 "Cultural Growth"
COS_Cultural_Growth_desc:0 "Many of our intellectuals have chosen to study in the nation of Flanders-Wallonia, more precise at the Catholic University of Leuven, and the continued partnership between the two has led to an increased interest by the Flemish-Wallonian people in our culture and traditions. Aware of our pride in our National Theatre, their government has shown willingness to fund its renovation and strengthen cultural ties."
COS_Mitteleuropan_Trade_Agreement:0 "Mitteleuropan Trade Agreement"
COS_Mitteleuropan_Trade_Agreement_desc:0 "Timid investments from the German companies has thusfar kept us from recovering fully but the terms of the new agreements drafted up by our government with the [REDACTED] have shown promise for both our citizens and the assets under control by our German allies."

COS_Industrial_Developement_Scheme:0 "Industrial Development Scheme"

COS_Expand_Textile_Industry:0 "Textile Industry"
COS_Expand_Textile_Industry_desc:0 "Although artisanal in nature, the textile industry of Costa Rica is renown across the region and has close ties to both American and German clothing companies.

COS_Economic_Boom:0 "Economic Boom"

COS_Gold_Mining:0 "Dig Deeper"
COS_Gold_Mining_desc:0 "Located primarily on the Northern side of our country, the old Spanish gold mines are nearing depletion. As they haven't been a major part of our economy for decades, prospecting for new sites has always been postponed. The collapse of the coffee market has made the government realise that diversifying the economy is key and has led to prospectors getting invitations to examine the surface of our nation."
COS_Foreign_Knowhow:0 "Foreign Know-how"
COS_Foreign_Knowhow_desc:0 "Our nation has thus far lacked adequate higher education which has led to many of the upper class studying abroad, with a certain preference to the universities of Flanders-Wallonia. Instead of letting our citizens travel abroad for education, we should encourage foreign teachers to come to Costa Rica and assist us in the creation of our own higher education system."
COS_Manufacturing_Industry:0 "Foundations of a Manufacturing Industry"
COS_Manufacturing_Industry_desc:0 "Limited to the production of farming tools and small products for domestic use, our manufacturing industry is in dire need of state intervention. Thousands of small workshops exist across the nation but the connection between these producers and their customers has thus far only been determined by their location. By steering the economy with a heavy hand, the state hopes to centralise production."
COS_Escuela_Metalica:0 "Escuela Metalica"
COS_Escuela_Metalica_desc:0 "Serving as the Headquarters of the Escuela Buenaventura Corrales, the school is one of the oldest education facilities in the nation, a symbol of great pride and a testament to the industrialisation of our nation.

COS_Heavy_Industry:0 "Heavy Industrial Expansion"

COS_A_Different_Approach_desc:0 "As smoke stacks and dark clouds mark the skyline of the industrialised nation, we as Costa Ricans should take pride in our natural beauty and stay away from the temptations of mass production.

COS_Tourism_Industry:0 "Promote Tourism"

COS_Boost_Cash_Crops:0 "Boost Cash Crops"
COS_Boost_Cash_Crops_desc:0 "Cash crops have served us well for generations and are far cleaner and less demanding on our people than the work in mines and factories. Further contracts with the ZKG and UFC should help us further expand the export economy whilst keeping our nation clear from the taint of industrialisation."
COS_Small_Business:0 "Small Business"
COS_Small_Business_desc:0 "Contrary to most Central American nations, Costa Rica has a well-developed manufacturing industry and is quickly expanding this sector across the nation. Over 7000 of these little "factories" exist and while they do it somewhat ineffiecently, they still sustain the needs of our population, while also providing valuable trade goods to our neighbours."
COS_Hydro_Elelectricity:0 "Hydro-Electricity"

We can only hope that others soon realise the same thing..."

COS_Educational_Reforms:0 "Educational Reforms"
COS_Educational_Reforms_desc:0 "With the spirit "Costa Rica has more teachers than soldiers" in mind, neglecting the education policy would be last on our agenda. As the last major education reform dates back to the 19th century when the Catholic missions had to make way for a secular system, little has changed leading to both our curricula and infrastructure starting to show cracks."

COS_Cement_Administration_desc:0 "Whilst Castro may not be liked by everyone due to his strict and severe punishments, one cannot deny that the efficiency and reliability of the civil service has leapt lightyears ahead of what it was before his presidency.

COS_Adapt_the_Constitution:0 "Adapt the Constitution"
COS_Adapt_the_Constitution_desc:0 "As outlined by the Costa Rican constitution, presidents are not allowed to immediately serve a second term after their first one is over.

COS_Iron_Bars_Presidency_desc:0 "Nicknamed the President of Iron Bars, Castro has received the cognomen due to his massive investments in infrastructural expansion and the reinvigoration of our more backwards regions.

COS_La_Sabana_International:0 "La Sabana International"

COS_Railroad_Expansion:0 "Railroad Expansion"
COS_Railroad_Expansion_desc:0 "Until now the vast majority of our railroads were constructed by foreign contractors in exchange for acres of plantation land. The unreliability of the global market however and the rapid decline in American stability has prompted the government to take decisive action and focus on training technicians and construction workers able to do the work without foreign assistance."
COS_Bananas_South_Pacific:0 "Banana Plantations in the South Pacific"
COS_Bananas_South_Pacific_desc:0 "Due to the focus of the UFC on the Atlantic coast and the region around Puerto Limon, development of the Pacific Coast has been lacking for decades now with plantations on this side of the nation working far less efficient and suffering due to a lack of infrastructure. By cooperating with the UFC, we hope to attract more investments to this region and combat the rising poverty."

COS_Socialist_Victory_desc:0 "Although coming as a surprise to many, close friends and associates of Calderon saw this "sudden" change in policy from far away. Influenced by his studies at the Catholic University of Leuven, the Doctor has taken a great liking to the Papal "Rerum Novarum" and has seen in it the solution to the fallacies of capitalism and a viable alternative to the radical syndicalism that has taken over the world."
COS_Break_Coffee_Elite:0 "Break Coffee Elite"
COS_Break_Coffee_Elite_desc:0 "For decades now Costa Rican politics have been indirectly controlled by a small minority of wealthy coffee barons who have dictated the policy of the nation through the PRN. It is their influence that we will need to rid ourselves of if we want to stand any chance at fully implementing our social program."
COS_Develop_Atlantic_Region:0 "Develop Atlantic Region"
COS_Develop_Atlantic_Region_desc:0 "One of the major issues in Costa Rica is the very limited diet the average citizen consumes which leads to a great deficit of protein. Therefore the president has decided to kill two birds with one stone and plans to increase subsidies for the coastal region on the Atlantic, boost the fishing industry and distribute seafood to the interior of the nation."
COS_Introduce_Work_Code:0 "Introduce Work Code"
COS_Introduce_Work_Code_desc:0 "The main pillar of Calderons policy, the Labour code comes as a reaction to the mounting labour conflicts between employer and employee.

COS_Diversify_the_Economy_desc:0 "Even though we have made massive headway in the development of our social system, the economy has taken a massive hit and is groaning under the weight of these new expenditures.

COS_Nationalise_Banks_desc:0 "To relieve the crushing poverty and deprivation of the rural population, Don Pepe has formulated a plan in which the public sector would be financed by profits from state-owned enterprises, and the private sector would be financed by state banking.

cos.1.d:0 "Tucked away deep in the Central American jungles, our small but proud nation has flourished for many decades enjoying literacy rates higher than some European nations and a slow but steadily growing economy based on the banana and especially coffee trade.\n\nEnsured by a strict adherence of all parties to the constitution, there has been no military intervention or political coup in the nation since the failed dictatorship of Ticino in 1917 who was deposed mere months later under pressure from the people, refusing to endure a dictator in their republic. Ever since the nation has been controlled by a varied albeit egalitarian caste of politicians who have enjoyed the fruits of the growing German economy and the close ties between our two nations.\n\nUnder the wing of the PRN, president Ricardo Jiminez is able to look back on a successful term in which he dealt with both the economic depression caused by the American recession and the rising voices of socialist movements who enthused by the Atlantic Workers Congress have finally risen up from their slumber and demanded better representation. Although they somewhat succeeded in their aims and have forced the government to draft a labour accord, the law is far from passed yet and under the rising star of Manual Mora Valverde trouble between companies and workers is far from over.\n\nNevertheless, the nation flourishes as the fruits of our relations with Mitteleuropa are flowing in in the form of cultural exchange programs, scientific assistance and a strong bond between universities such as the KU Leuven in Flanders-Wallonia and the Costa Rican upper class."

cos.2.t:0 "Nomination of the Republican Candidate"
cos.2.d:0 "Whilst the supremacy of the PRN is unquestionable in the upcoming elections, the party is divided on who to push forward to serve as their Presidential candidate.\n\nLeón Cortés Castro has the support of the conservative coffee elite and has proven during the tenure of Jimenez to be a worthy successor to his legacy. Other members however have remarked that his aggressive anti-socialist stance and strict attitude could lead to further escalation amidst the socialist sphere and as such provide a feeding bottom for Valverdes syndicalist party.\n\nAs a compromise between the two extremes, the Church persuaded by the encyclical Rerum Novarum, has pushed forward Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia. His political career is not very noteworthy and most people only know him as the 'Doctor' due to his medical profession. With both sides hoping to use him as a sock puppet whilst ruling in his stead, support for his candidacy is increasing by the day."

Careful spending by our former president has luckily allowed our government to build up a small reserve with which we will now attempt to stop the down-spiraling catastrophe that has hit the ZKG.

Weary of outsiders in their land however, the Costa Ricans never fully embraced their new citizens and kept a distinct distance from them. Over the years this has led to friction between the two parties which only escaped escalation due to the geographical features keeping them apart.\n\nFaltering profits from the coffee trade however and a general consciousness amongst the negro population have let the two groups once more collide.

### COTO Events ###
cos.30.t:0 "Crisis Over Coto!"
cos.30.d:0 "Ever since the independence of Panama from Spain, they have laid claim to the Coto, a region in Panama's Chiriquí Province along the Panamanian-Costa Rican border. In 1911 the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Edward D. White, was asked to arbitrate. He rendered his decision in 1914, but Panama did not accept it, alleging that it favored Costa Rica. Hostilities broke out in 1921, when Costa Rica invaded the area. Panama recaptured the area easily. The conflict spread, however, when Costa Rica moved into the province of Bocas del Toro. Fearing that its interests might be threatened, the United States forced Panama to accept the White decision.\n\nAs our American allies have now fallen into anarchy, the Panamanian government has reopened the dispute and is demanding that we hand over the territory or face their army on the battlefield. Whilst our troops have recently grown in size, we are still completely outmatched by our Panamanian neighbours and will need foreign assistance if we are to become victorious.\n\nOur allies however are less eager to fight yet another pointless war and would prefer a more diplomatic solution to the crisis by re-enforcing the Fallo White ruling and forcing Panama to back down once and for all."

Demanding new and better laws have ultimately culminated in the creation of the so-called Collective agreement between the workers and the companies responsible. No response has been granted yet by spokesmen of the companies but many fear that they will once again send in hit squads to pressure the workers into submission."

Hoping that through sales and advertising the newspaper will also become a source of income for the struggling party, they have ironically turned their paper in a cacophony of both ads praising the virtues of capitalism and articles harshly criticizing this same practice. How hilarious the situation however may be, [COS.GetLeader] is all but pleased that somebody dares threaten his image and has already announced countermeasures against the newspaper should they continue to protest his regime."

cos.61.t:0 "Signature of the Collective Agreement Between Workers"
cos.61.d:0 "Years have passed since the Great Banana Strike of 1934 but the Costa Rican people have pushed on against the UFC. As the situation in the USA went from bad to catastrophe, the UFC saw that would they not cooperate with the local population their time in the nation may be coming to an end. Finally agreeing on many of the labour concerns pressed by the syndicalist Manuel Mora, the company was backed into a corner whilst the government refused to assist them in the matter.\n\nAchieving minimum wages that would not be given in company coupons, six hour shifts, recognition of injury law and many other concessions, this is a great success for the Costa Rican left and has also led to the creation of the first actual trade unions, expanding where the Atlantic Workers Congress had laid the foundations.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, the ZKG has also ratified the new Labour Accord and has expressed their full desire to work with the workers to create a better and safer work environment"
cos.61.a:0 "A success for all parties involved...except the stocks."

cos.62.t:0 "Regulation of the Press"
cos.62.d:0 "Even though "Trabaio" has seen little success in capturing the minds of its readers, other newspapers have started to write about our regime in a bad light. Whilst it is their constitutional right to have the freedom to express their opinions, we feel that they could be...motivated to direct their attention elsewhere.\n\nThe success of the Labour Accord has sadly brought with it the rise of further far left media who openly oppose our regime and are calling for a "Revolution", surely the people must see that this is treason of the highest degree?"

Guaranteeing [COS.GetLeader] that the resettlement procedure would not cost the state a penny, they are urging the government to set a side a small parcel of land for them build a Jewish community."

cos.64.d:0 "The war in the United States seems to have no end in sight and whilst many are dying on the front-lines of the various American battlegrounds, many more are attempting to escape the nation hoping for a safe place until the war has ended. Our renown reputation as one of the most democratic and accepting nations in the Caribbean region has made us an attractive destination and has prompted thousands to embark on cargo freighters towards our little state. Accepting these immigrants will lead to an increased amount of capital in the nation but tensions are already running high between the Native Costa Ricans and the black Jamaican population. Further immigration may lead to open conflict if we are not careful."

cos.65.d:0 "Whilst some have appreciated the heavy handed interventionism by [COS.GetLeader], not everyone is equally content and with the Regional Elections approaching, the popularity of the PRN is tanking heavily in the polls. Especially the syndicalist PVP under Manuel Mora Valverde is making decent headway and seems set to deliver congressmen like Carlos Luis Sáenz this time around. In these trying times it's key that our resolve remains unshaken and therefore president [COS.GetLeader] is secretly planning to lift the syndicalists from office the moment they are elected and arrest them on charges of treason."

cos.68.d:0 "Constructed in the late 19th century, when San Jose's population was only around 19,000 people with the money earned during the coffee boom, the Teatro Nacional has long served as one of the prime institutes of high-quality musical and theatrical performances in Central America. Waning interest by the people however and a lack of homegrown plays suited for the prestige of the building however have left it in a somewhat neglected state.\n\nThat was until a company of Flemish-Wallonian investors travelling through the nation during a trade mission sent out by Mitteleuropa came upon the site, instantly falling in love with the institution. Promising to send aid and performers from their homeland, the Teatro has received a sizeable grant to continue its operations with. When a recent reportage was subsequently featured in the Flemish-Wallonian paper De Standaard, a public crowdfunding campaign to support the Teatro was started with great success across their nation.\n\nPresented today by the Ambassador from Mitteleuropa, a small ceremony was held in front of the building in which the grant was symbolically exchanged for a bag of Costa Rican coffee beans."

Influenced by the Peruvian political thinker Victor Raúl Haya de la Torre, the young intellectuals believed that the state should be an instrument for enacting radical social reform. They are frustrated by the failures of Cortes' administrations to address social issues and applaud the Atlantic Workers Congress for pushing back against the UFC.

I speak to you with a heavy heart as I see the values for which our republic has fought so bravely are being tarnished at every end. The constitution, once the sacred fundament of our society has been spit on by our most enlightened president. The freedom of speech we once prided ourselves on is ripped to shreds by the censure of Castros regime and the man in the street is lied to and oppressed. Where one day, addressing the government openly and criticizing its failing policies was seen as virtuous and right, it is now a direct path to jail. How long Costa Ricans will you endure the dictator? How many more of our civil liberties need to be removed before we realize that the man in the Presidential Palace does not speak for us?"\n\nContinuing preaching for over half an hour, the distinguished businessman was finally removed from the air by police forces and arrested for treason. The damage however is done and police forces across San Jose are wondering how the situation should be handled. Punishing Ferrer severly will only make him a martyr while others fear that releasing him will allow him to gather further support against the government."

"Costa Rica has more teachers than soldiers" is one of the favorite ways a Costa Rican describes his country and this pride is deeply nested.\n\nThat is until now as President Calderon has recently announced dramatic changes to primary and secondary education based on his inspiration source, the Papal encyclical "Rerum Novarum". "religion should be obeyed; that a high standard of morality should prevail, both in public and private life." Based on these ideas, Calderon not only reverted the 1894 ban on teachers from monastic orders but even obligated parents who want their child excluded from Catholic teachings to personally deliver a written not to the teacher, by doing so making children who use such notes be seen as "special" and laughing stocks for the others."

Though many leaders had placed family members in positions of power, Calderón's brother has become infamous for doling out non-competitive government contracts to cronies and people who pay him bribes. This has led him to acquire the nickname “Paco a Medias” because allegedly he demands a 50% kickback up front before offering contracts.\n\nEven though Calderon announced himself as a president of the people for the people, the economic mismanagement of his nation and the catastrophic increase in corruption are weighing heavily on the nation."

cos.131.d:0 "To our great surprise the Canadian government has politely refused our offer, most likely out of fear that they would have to defend us should the time come."
cos.131.a:0 "At least we tried."

cos.1000.t:0 "Peace in Central America?" 
cos.1000.d:0 "For the past several months, we have been fighting and bleeding in Central America for our erstwhile allies in Costa Rica. Despite our best efforts however, Costa Rica has fallen, and so has much of our national pride. With the fall of Costa Rica. many have begun to call for us to pull out of Central America, leaving our allies to their fate. After all, why should we bleed for a nation that has already fallen? These call for peace have reached such a height that even the Kaiser has taken note. With his say-so, we could end this war, and return to more important matters, although doing so would be a clear backstab to our allies. The question remains, what will the Kaiser decide?"
cos.1000.a:0 "We shall have peace."
cos.1000.b:0 "Germany never surrenders! Onward!"

zkg.1.t:0 "The ZKG Overthrows the Government!"
zkg.1.d:0 "The Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft, with its unrelenting advances and use of corporate savagery, has managed to buy out most of its competitors, and those they could not persuade to sell have simply been run out of business. Furthermore, with their growing fortune and control, they have been able to buy out most of our ruling government, with most of our ministers and representatives all being paid by the ZKG. \n\nAs the incontestable new masters of Costa Rica, the ZKG is now rapidly moving to cement their newfound authority, but as they build the foundations of their new state, this board of coffee barons and business tycoons faces a crossroads. With our position as the new heralds of the Kaiserreich’s will in Central America, the Kaiser himself has taken a keen interest on this matter, which has led many within our ranks to push for the establishment of a new reich here in Costa Rica. These monarchists and Berlin-loyalists believe that by creating a new German throne here in Costa Rica, we could more efficiently industrialize and control this new nation, with the new Kaiser serving as a rallying figure in an attempt to create a strong sense of national legitimacy. The Kaiser has taken an interest in this specific idea, and has surprisingly pushed for his narcisstic and effeminate son August to take this new throne, should it be created. However, this plan is not without its detractors, for a large portion of the ZKG’s Board of Directors would rather go with a more straightforward approach. These corporate titans instead seek to have the Board of Directors rule as an oligarchic council, each co-ruling behind the unified front of the ZKG in the place of a single executive. With the ZKG in direct control of the nation, their corporate interests and financial gain are sure to be a top priority over any attempts of nation building. What shall be the Board’s final decision?"
zkg.1.a:0 "August Wilhelm shall rule as the first Kaiser of Costa Rica."
zkg.1.b:0 "The ZKG’s Board of Directors shall directly rule Costa Rica."

zkg.2.t:0 "A New Throne for the House of Hohenzollern"
zkg.2.d:0 "With the ZKG’s decision to kowtow to Berlin, word was sent to our new sovereign, and after a week’s journey by ship, Prince August Wilhelm has finally arrived in Costa Rica. Landing in our largest Atlantic port at Puerto Limón, the soon-to-be Kaiser of Costa Rica was rushed to the capital of San José for his coming coronation. \n\nAfter being prepared for the ceremony and outfitted with his imperial garb, August and his retinue then made the pilgrimage from San José to the neighboring city of Cartago, where the largest church in Costa Rica, the Basílica Nuestra Señora de Los Ángeles, was located. Along the route, local clergymen blessed the trail ahead and his wake as crowds of civilians watched from the sidelines. After his arrival to the altar of the basilica, the Prince would be crowned as Kaiser August I of the Costa Ricanisches Reich, with the ZKG’s Board of Directors serving under him as his administrative liaisons and ministers."
zkg.2.a:0 "The Reichsadler has taken flight over Costa Rica."

zkg.3.t:0 "The Flamboyant Kaiser"
zkg.3.d:0 "The new Kaiser of Costa Rica has long enjoyed a more extravagant life than most of his siblings. Enjoying fine parties, lavish celebrations, and the life of a socialite, August has long had a reputation for enjoying life’s finer things. However, he has also been rumored to harbor more flamboyant tastes. \n\n His own activities have long strained his marriage to Princess Alexandra Victoria, though divorce or even separation have all been denied by his father Kaiser Wilhelm himself. Rumors of his wild late-night romps with his close male friends without his own wife in attendance, his habit of experimental drug use, and even his secret penchant for cross-dressing and accused ‘homophillic’ tendecies have all bubbled to the surface before - all rumors actively suppressed by the ZKG and its Board of Directors that serve under the new Kaiser as his advisors and ministers. Whatever the truth is, most in the nation have been too busy working for their new German masters to care much for the private life of some royal."
zkg.3.a:0 "What the Kaiser does in his private life is his business."

zkg.4.t:0 "Interests Outside the Extravagant"
zkg.4.d:0 "Aside from his love of royal life’s finer moments, the Kaiser holds a wide variety of interests and talents, from equestrian pursuits to an interest in military history and tactics. However, more interestingly has been the young Kaiser’s interest in German nationalist movements, particularly the thoughts of prominent German nationalist figures and generals such as Hermann Göring, Reinhard Heydrich, and Ferdinand Schörner. Frequently corresponding with these titans of German nationalist rhetoric, the new Kaiser has struck up a sort of friendship with these grizzled military men, though if they respond out of genuine interest or loyalty to their Kaiser is unknown. Regardless, they at least humor Kaiser August while he lives in a disconnected fantasy land far at the edge of the New World as the ZKG further’s their hold over Central America."
zkg.4.a:0 "Curious friends for such a curious man."

zkg.5.t:0 "The Kaiser’s ‘Favorite’ Son"
zkg.5.d:0 "A nagging thought has long crept in the dark recesses of August’s mind - the thought that his own father, the Kaiser of Germany himself, hated him. The writing was on the wall, for the Kaiser had long been disgusted and embarrassed by ‘Auwi’s’ habits and predilections, forcing his marriage to Princess Alexndra Victoria to continue well past the point any healthy marriage would have collapsed. Despite him being one of the Kaiser's youngest children, far less experienced than Eitel or Friedrich Wilhelm, he was the one chosen to be sent half-way across the planet to lord over some strip of sand and jungle. Was he sent here to reward him for enduring life’s hardships, or was he truly just sent here by the Kaiser to rid Berlin of the headache Auwi’s antics caused. This dilemma ate away at the Kaiser, haunting him as he ruled over his new Central American fiefdom."
zkg.5.a:0 "Was this throne a gift or a punishment?"

zkg.7.t:0 "The Price of our New Reich"
zkg.7.d:0 "With the arrival of our new mandate came a considerable debt to Germany, as Berlin helped pay for much of the groundwork the ZKG used to launch itself to success, and without German support, our new state would surely wither and fall to the locals. With this reality in mind, and until the ZKG can acrew enough new profit in this recently expanded venture to pay back the Kaiser and his government, we shall be at their mercy, and so will our economy."
zkg.7.a:0 "A temporary setback until we can rebuild our fortunes."

zkg.8.t:0 "The Prussia of Latin America"
zkg.8.d:0 "With our expansion proving successful and the roots of German Imperialism firmly taking hold, Central America has seen the rise of a new state. Under their Kaiser, the extravagant August Wilhelm, the people of this isthmus have prospered and been uplifted, and under the stewardship of the ZKG, our economy has flourished. Prussian idealism and the militant, stalwart spirit of our homeland rings true throughout these jungles. Under Kaiser August, the Costa Ricanisches Reich has proven triumphant, and under his rule, all of German-controlled Central America shall rejoice and prosper, ever stalwart and ready to defend itself from any foe."
zkg.8.a:0 "A new land for the German people and the Prussia ideal to both flourish."

zkg.9.t:0 "Zentralamerika Under the Reich"
zkg.9.d:0 "After a recent string of successful conquests, both through harsh business acumen and through sheer force, our once small empire has grown to stretch across this entire isthmus, leaving all of Central American in our grasp. With our opulent sovereign Kaiser August Wilhelm on the throne, we are ready to proclaim the Zentralamerikanisches Reich. The natural evolution of our colonial ambitions here in Latin America and wholey made possible with the aid of the ZKG, the Reichsadler now soars over all of Central America, from Guatemala down to Panama and even out into the Carribean. With this new domain, the will of the Reichspakt now extends deep into the New World, furthering the strength of the world hegemon and uplifting Central America in the process."
zkg.9.a:0 "A land where coffee is King and August is the Kaiser."

zkg.10.t:0 "The Caffeine Festival"
zkg.10.d:0 "A task our Minister Anthony Sarg has been trusted with is ensuring that the people that are now under our control are appeased and do not pose a threat to our operations security. This task has proven to be a challenge to him for the simple reason that he is not a fighter or enforcer, he was an entertainer before this, however seeing as Director Deininger has personally entrusted him with this mission, he is obliged to serve. So how does a man who creates puppet shows deal with ensuring that no one wants to rebel in a nation no longer under their population's control, well Sarg has come up with the idea of not giving them a reason to be unhappy in the first place. So Sarg has taken something out from Roman history for exactly this purpose, State-endorsed festivals and entertainment to keep the populace happy and their minds occupied from thoughts on the political situation.\n\nSo now the citizens of San Jose and other townships across the nation hold these dancing and feasting festivities for the aptly called “caffeine festival". Named after the fact that large amounts of sugar and coffee are consumed making people partake in fevered dances and partying, sponsored by the government to take a day off from work on the plantations and take their mind off work. It seems to work to Sarg’s plan as the common citizenry tend to stop complaining once the government announces a date for one of these festivals to occur."
zkg.10.a:0 "That should get them to calm down for a bit."

zkg.11.t:0 "The Coffee Rush"
zkg.11.d:0 "With the new possibilities for profit and opportunities for a better life now expanding and revealing themselves as the ZKG further develops Costa Rica and their other holdings, a mad dash of German colonization has begun to spring forth. Like the California Gold Rush that the American’s rode to dominate their West Coast, the German people have become obsessed with Coffee, driving both sales and immigration up as more seek to tap into the ZKG’s new bounty. We shall utilize and act on this natural boom in imperialist spirit. We shall massively encourage any and all citizens of the Kaiserreich to come live in this verdant land of opportunity. With their blood, we shall further Germanize all of Central America, and on their backs, the ZKG shall only see more profit!"
zkg.11.a:0 "Our borders are open to all true Germans seeking profit and adventure."


zkg.13.t:0 "Seize the Lifeline of Western Shipping!"
zkg.13.d:0 "Disastrous news has reached our capital today that the Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft, or ZKG, has demanded that we accept their deal to sell the Panama Canal to them. If we do not, they threaten war, and with their allies in the Reichspakt, including the Kaiserreich itself, this would likely mean the end of Panama. We have no other real choice, and we likely will have to cede the Canal to Costa Rica, or be destroyed entirely."
zkg.13.a:0 "A harsh, saddening reality. We must yield."
zkg.13.b:0 "Damn the consequences! The Canal is ours!"


zkg.14.t:0 "The Newest Evolution of the Banana Republics"
zkg.14.d:0 "With the recent expansion and primacy of the Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft, Costa Rica has been fully transformed into a new breed of corporate state. Like the Americans and their United Fruit Company of old that once created the famed Banana Republics of Honduras and Guatemala, the ZKG and their German benefactors have created a new ‘Kaffee Republik’ here in Costa Rica. Under the Board of Directors, the economy of our state has flourished, rapidly rising to become one of the more affluent Latin American states, at the cost of the natural environment and the rights of the locals. Their noble sacrifices have built our newfound successes, and on their bodies we shall transform Costa Rica into a truly Capitalist state unlike the world has ever seen!"
zkg.14.a:0 "The only king here is coffee."

zkg.15.t:0 "The Purchase of the Century"
zkg.15.d:0 "In an atmosphere of intense negotiations and sleazy backroom deals, an official offer for the purchase of the entire Panama Canal has been finalized and put forth to the canal officials from the desk Costa Rica’s new masters, the Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft. The ZKG is offering a massive, multi-million dollar lump sum to entirely purchase the Canal and its surrounding land, no strings attached, from the Canal’s current owners. The ZKG, however, has not been the friendliest in these negotiations, and many expect them to go to great lengths to ensure the deal passes, with some even expecting the rampant Capitalists to go as far as to declare war on our nation should the deal fall through. The southern wilds of the Central American isthmus are in a state of national anxiety has the future of Central America and international shipping at large hand in the balance."
zkg.15.a:0 "A deal is struck, and the ZKG has fully purchased the Panama Canal!"
zkg.15.b:0 "The deal falls through, and the ZKG prepares for war!"

zkg.16.t:0 "A Disastrous Denial"
zkg.16.d:0 "The foul bastards that lord over [FROM.GetName] denied our most generous offer to take their land off their hands. Even with the exorbitant price we offered, the fools have declined without a second thought. We will show them the error of their ways, for the ZKG’s destiny is to control Central America!"
zkg.16.a:0 "Curse the lot of them!"

zkg.17.t:0 "The Nicaraguan Deal"
zkg.17.d:0 "A most strange and unexpected offer has landed on the desk of our nation’s top executives, hailing from the growing corporate state in Costa Rica. Under the influence of the Kaiserreich and the Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft, or ZKG, Costa Rica has offered our ruling administration a massive sum of money as payment to effectively ‘buy’ all of Nicaragua. If we accepted this deal, we would all live like kings as the ZKG effectively took full control of the nation in our stead. Sure, the people of our great state may curse us for it, but who cares when we would be made some of the richest men in Latin American seemingly overnight. A tempting offer for sure, but can we really damn our countrymen to the corporate rule of foreigners?"
zkg.17.a:0 "Of course we can! Sell the underlings out and welcome Nicaragua’s new owners."
zkg.17.b:0 "We would never sell out our countrymen! We will show them the error of their ways by force!"

zkg.18.t:0 "An Army Fit for a Monopoly"
zkg.18.d:0 "As one of the less-prioritized holdings of the wider German Empire, we receive the short stick when it comes to new supplies, especially when military supplies are concerned. As such, the armed forces of the ZKG are sorely lacking, primarily made up of green soldiers using outdated equipment left over from the Weltkrieg. We must address this situation the best way we know how to: with money. Central America is rife with mercenaries and hired guns that could easily fill the gaps in our armed forces, allowing us to build a new army capable of defending the corporate interests of the ZKG. Though it won’t be the most professional or standardized army, it should be more than enough to protect the Coffee plantations and borders of our new corporate state."
zkg.18.a:0 "Through gold we shall purchase the lead we need to protect our state."

zkg.19.t:0 "From Wild Forests to Urban Jungles"
zkg.19.d:0 "One of the largest goals of the ZKG has been to transform the once pristine natural wilderness of Costa Rica and the rest of Central America into a concrete jungle poised to place profit over all other pursuits. With funding from German and their own Coffee-fueled business ventures, this process of ‘hyper-industrialization’ has already begun, slowly but efficiently clearing more useless tracts of hinterlands into profitable and beneficial new space ripe to develop and cover in concrete and steel. As more factories spring to life, igniting their furnaces and boilers for the first time using fuels sourced from this once-verdant Eden, the black smoke of progress fills the air of Central America. All shall be used and consumed by the ZKG, for the only thing that matters in the end is not clean air or sustainable practices, but profit."
zkg.19.a:0 "As the seas turn black and the skies fill with smog, we shall raise our profit-margins like never before."


zkg.22.t:0 "The Riches Of Coffee"
zkg.22.d:0 "Costa Rica now shines as a glimmering and golden paradise of Capitalist progress, unshackled by the limitations of lesser states and lesser men. Under the Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft and its genius Board of Directors, we have transformed this thin slice of Latin America into a corporatist paradise entirely under the dominion of the ZKG. Every aspect of the nation and its economy are finely controlled by the Board, and the nation’s entire financial apparatus is in the hands of this massive corporation. With their ambitions only further skyrocketing as they seek to become the dominant economic force in all of Latin America, the world now watches out for glorious Capitalist paradise as we further strive for greater riches and higher profits."
zkg.22.a:0 "We truly live in a coffee-fueled society."

zkg.23.t:0 "A New Breed of Capitalism"
zkg.23.d:0 "The largest peaceful land acquisitions since the Louisiana Purchase have been finalized, and the Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft now lords over all of Central America. The ZKG now stands as the single master of all Central America, and this Isthmus of Opportunity shall now truly live up to its name. Already, the ZKG has moved to consolidate their rule, incorporating any and all economic assets in the nation while subjugating the local peoples under the newly expanded regime of the Board of Directors. Many have begun to whisper that the ZKG’s recent policies and expansion defy conventional descriptions, and has risen to such a sheer height of economic success and Capitalistic dominance that the ZKG’s Central America has become the modern world’s first true example of a ‘megacorporation’ - a single monopoly that effectively controls all aspects of a single nation. The economy, government, culture, and wider society of Central America is now simply subject to the whims of their new corporate overlords. Under the ZKG, there are no gods or masters, only coffee, and coffee means profit!"
zkg.23.a:0 "May profit ever find the Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft!"
zkg.23.b:0 "We shall become the first true megacorporation in more than just name!"

zkg.24.t:0 "The Zentralamerikanische Deal"
zkg.24.d:0 "With the growing influence of the German corporatists, this coming offer that has landed on the desk of our nation’s top executives was expected to arrive sooner or later, especially after what had happened to Nicaragua and the Canal. Under the influence of the Kaiserreich and the Zentralamerikanische Kaffee-Gesellschaft, or ZKG, Costa Rica has offered our ruling administration a massive sum of money as payment to effectively ‘buy’ the entirety of our nation. If we accepted this deal, we would all live like kings as the ZKG effectively took full control of the nation in our stead, though after seeing how the people of Nicaragua faired under the ZKG’s arrival, many in our cabinet have their reservations. Sure, the people of our great state may curse us for it, but who cares when we would be made some of the richest men in Latin American seemingly overnight. A tempting offer for sure, but can we really damn our countrymen to the corporate rule of foreigners?"
zkg.24.a:0 "How could we turn down such an exorbitant offer!"
zkg.24.b:0 "We will not throw away our national sovereignty for mere cash."

zkg.25.t:0 "The Seizure of Puerto Rico"
zkg.25.d:0 "In a quick and decisive show of force, a small squadron of our naval forces met and fought with a local naval patrol outside the coastal waters of Puerto Rico. With German funding, our newly re-equipped vessels made short work of the local Puerto Rican garrison, but this clash has pushed the Caribbean to the brink of all-out war. However, the meek forces of Puerto Rico and their masters do not seek to instigate war with the formidable Reichspakt, and have surprisingly rolled over in the negotiations. With their cowardly surrender and submittance to German dominance, control over Puerto Rico has been handily and fully transferred over to the ZKG. Now this pristine island shall serve as the main naval base for the ZKG’s growing Capitalist domain as they work to sink their claws into Puerto Rico to drain it of any possible profit."
zkg.25.a:0 "It’s free real estate!"

zkg.26.t:0 "The Revival of Klein-Venedig?"
zkg.26.d:0 "Klein-Venedig, also named Welserland after the affluent noble trade family from Germany that financed the expedition, was founded in 1528 under Charles V, and represented the largest German colonial effort in the New World, extending along the coast of Venezuela, with a small portion of Colombia, and centered around the towns of New Augsburg and New Nuremberg. For 20 years, the colony stood strong, but its settlers eventually succumbed to disease, famine, and native attacks, causing the death of the colony by 1546. Now, nearly 400 years later, we stand at a crossroads, able to finally make this old colonial dream a successful reality. Should we adopt the identity of the old failed Klein-Venedig, or Welserland, or should we maintain the Deutsch-Zentralamerikian identity we have already begun crafting?"
zkg.26.a:0 "We are a true testament to Germany's imperial might!"
zkg.26.b:0 "Let us restore the honor and glory of the Welser family!"
zkg.26.c:0 "Well, we are ‘Zentralamerikan’ after all, aren't we?"

POLITICS_ALIKHAN_BUKEIKHANOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 5th, 1866, in Tokraunskaya volost, Semipalatinsk Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Älihan Bökeihan, or as he is better known in Petrograd, Alikhan Bukeykhanov, was a part of the Qazaq upper class from birth - he was a direct descendant of the khans of the Bukei Horde, an autonomous Qazaq state which surrendered to the Russians in the 19th century. He acquired his higher education in St. Petersburg and grew up influenced by Kadet liberalism and moderate socialism - ultimately, this drew him to become a member of the Kadets. However, as he was a diligent campaigner for Qazaq autonomy, after the February Revolution Bökeihan ceased to find support among the Kadets in this most important issue for him. In July 1917, the Alash party was founded with Bökeihan as its leader - a liberal, progressive and national party of all Qazaqs.\n\nAfter the civil war, the Alash autonomy was finally confirmed as an autonomous territory of Russia, and Älihan became the Minister-President of its local parliament, basically ruling as a governor of the autonomy. All this time he remained in office, supported by both the central government in Petrograd and the local parliament. In recent years, however, the aging ruler has more than once considered leaving office, but the only thing that seems to be holding him at his place is the party he created, which has split into various factions over the years and risks dissolution in case he retires."
POLITICS_MIRJAKIP_DULATULY_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! November 25th, 1885, in Sarykopinsk volost, Turgay Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Mirjaqyp Dulatuly. A very charismatic political presence but he is in many ways the perfect embodiment of the Alash Orda’s personality cults, and cliquishness. Dulatuly was floated as Bökeihan’s successor, but his radicalism and strong personal base of power alienated many others in the party, which saw Dulatuly snubbed in favour of the far more manipulatable and weak willed Yermekov. Dulatuly is to the left of the status quo, but he is still fundamentally a liberal and whilst his desire to end the political cliques in the Orda may seem noble, it is more that he simply seeks to supplant them with his own following."
POLITICS_SMAGUL_SADUAQASOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! November 1900, in Jarqyn aul, Akmolinsk Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Smagul Säduaqasov has received education in Russian-Qazaq school in 1915 and pursued further education at the Omsk Agricultural School. Alongside his studies, he began his career as a people's teacher in his native aul. In 1916 he became an active member of the Qazaq youth organization \"Birlik\" in Omsk, Akmolinsk Oblast - the direct predecessor of the Jas Azamat. The right-wing members of \"Birlik\" supported Alash Orda, and united to form Jas Azamat. This new organization was dedicated to the ideals of freedom and independence for the Qazaq people, as well as protection of the poor and social reforms. As a leader of this youth organization, Säduaqasov launched the newspaper of the same name, and later made Jas Azamat into official youth wing of the Alash party. He became even closer to the Alash leadership after he married Älihan Bökeihan's daughter Zeinep (Yelizaveta) in 1924. Together with her he moved to Tashkent in Turkestan, where they lived until 1927, returning to the Alash Autonomy afterwards. Smagul continued his political career, and was elected to the Halyq Kenesi - becoming one of the youngest members. In the beginning of the 1930s Jas Azamat became its own party, in a way, setting off a time bomb of the Alash party collapse. By 1936 he became one of the party's loudest critics, despite his family ties to the party's leadership."
POLITICS_ALIMKHAN_YERMEKOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! May 25th, 1891, in Qarqaraly, Semipalatinsk Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Älimhan Yermekov is known to many as voice of reason, a mathematician and skilled diplomat. Born to a middle class family, he received education in Tomsk, but had to stop his studies in order to join the Qazaq national-liberation movement. He became close to Älihan Bökeihan and was elected to Alash Orda's People's Council. After the war, he founded a school in his hometown, where he became headmaster and teacher of mathematics, as well as graduating from Tomsk university with diploma of a mining engineer and a specialty of a geological prospector. He returned to politics in late 1920s and soon became one of the closest allies of Bökeihan, and in situation of fractured party, he was an unapologetic supporter of the status quo. Now, becoming Bökeihan's successor, he's willing to preserve Alash Orda with its unique culture, but acknowleding the need for modernization."
POLITICS_MUQAN_AITPENOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1871, in Omsk uyezd, Akmolinsk Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Müqan Äitpenov was born in a poor family of a cattle-raisers, which in many ways determined his political career. After studying in the Russian-Qazaq school, he entered the Omsk teacher's seminary, later to be sent to the service as a clerk-translator of the office of the Omsk district chief, and then - as a translator in the Akmolinsk regional board. Before the revolutionary years he published articles on culture, healthcare, enlightenment, problems of agriculture on the pages of the \"Aykap\" magazine. Until the February Revolution he was an interpreter for the Akmolinsk Governor-General. With the Revolution, his activities as a politician began. As a chairman of the Omsk regional Qazaq committee, he became one of the organizers of the first Qazaq socialist party - the Üsh-Jüz, and its first chairman. However, the radical opposition within the party, led by Qölbay Tögusov, ousted Äitpenov, as he refused to work with the Bolsheviks and denied class division in the Steppe. Although Tögusov initially gained the upper hand in this conflict by being elected party chairman and immediately arresting Aitpenov, Tögusov himself was soon arrested and shot - by Kolchak's officers.\n\nThe Alash Party, however, could not forgive the Üsh-Jüz for criticizing it, and made considerable efforts to ensure that the party was destroyed. They failed, because after Kerensky's amnesty for \"Bolshevik sympathizers but not Communist Party members\", Äitpenov was released from prison and managed to reorganize Üsh-Jüz as a socialist opposition to the regime in the Alash autonomy. The party has retained many of the theses from its original program, but has never been able to get rid of its main problem - the populism of leaders who go to any lengths to discredit Alash and promise the impossible in their slogans. Now that Äitpenov is in charge of the country, he has a huge challenge ahead of him, how to keep the government and the country from chaos."
POLITICS_ALIBI_JANGILDIN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1884, in aul Qoyadul, Turgay Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! The first Qazaq revolutionary Bolshevik Älibi Jangeldin was born in 1884 in a poor family, twice ran away from home to get an education, studied in spiritual consistory in Orenburg. In 1905 he was expelled from the Moscow Academy for revolutionary activity and then Jangeldin set out on the road to walk around the entire globe. Älibi crossed Hungary, Serbia, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, India, Ceylon, Indochina and Japan, earning a living by photography. Four years later, Jangeldin returned home and by 1917 he became a hero of the common men. Together with Amangeldy Imanov, he raised an armed rebellion against the tsarist government, which lasted until the February Revolution. Having received a certificate from the Bolsheviks to conduct propaganda, Jangeldin returned to Torğai to spread the Bolshevik ideas, but was arrested on the orders Älihan Bökeihan.\n\nIn January 1918 Älibi Jangeldin promised Ioseb Jugashvili, then People's Commissar for Nationalities, that he could undermine the efforts of the Alash Orda to establish autonomy. In the summer of 1918 Jangeldin was given 68 million rubles, as well as weapons, ammunition, medicines and clothing. In August 1918, at the height of the Civil War, the detachment with the cargo boarded the schooners “Abbasin” and “Mehli” in Astrakhan, crossed the Caspian Sea, but the port was occupied by the Whites, so they had to land on a deserted shore and go through Mangyshlak. Periodically the caravan was attacked by the whites, several dozen people were killed. On November 11, after 57 days, Jangeldin delivered weapons, medicines and ammunition for the Reds fighting on the Aktyubinsk front. Unfortunately, the war was unfolding towards the victory of the Alash Orda and the Whites. Jangeldin had to flee his homeland once again, visiting Persia and then sailing to the French Commune to meet with the Bolsheviks. He returned to Alash Orda several years ago, incognito, and started to again organize underground communist movement."
POLITICS_SAKEN_SEIFULLIN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! October 15th, 1894, in aul Ortau, Akmolinsk Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Saken Seifullin, a luminary of Kazakh literature was born in the family of nomads. His parents instilled in their child a deep appreciation for their national culture from an early age. The father frequently played the dombra, while the mother captivated the young boy with tales from folklore and legends. His literary prowess was already established before the Revolution, with the publication of his collection of lyrical verses titled \"Bygone Days\" in 1910. The activities of Saken Seifullin as a revolutionary and advocate for Soviet power are strongly associated with Aqmola. In Omsk, Saken entered a teacher's seminary, where he encountered Russian revolutionaries and enthusiastically embraced their ideals and aspirations. By the age of twenty, Seifullin had become co-head of Birlik, the first Omsk youth organization dedicated to fostering cultural and educational initiatives among their fellow countrymen. Upon returning to Akmolinsk in 1917, Saken united intellectuals around himself, forming an initiative group affiliated with the Bolshevik movement. Simultaneously, he founded an organization for young Kazakhs called \"Jas Qazaq\", while also contributing articles to the Bolshevik newspaper Tirshilik. At the close of 1917, Seifullin, a revolutionary writer, was elected to the Council of Deputies and appointed as People's Commissar for Education. Throughout this period of struggle for Soviet power, Seifullin never abandoned his writing. In 1917, he penned the play \"On the Path to Happiness\", which was first performed at the Akmolinsk Club on May 1st, 1918, and proved highly successful in promoting revolutionary ideas.\n\nBut in June 1918, Seifullin, along with other Soviet officials, was arrested during a counter-revolutionary uprising. He was imprisoned and, along with fellow Soviet deputies, found himself on the \"death train\" of brutal Ataman Annenkov. After enduring unspeakable torments, he was destined to perish in the Omsk concentration camp. However, in April 1919, Seifullin managed to escape by chance.\n\nWith the demise of Soviet authority in the steppe, Seifullin went into hiding. Some claim that he ventured across the Mirzacho'l to Turkestan, while others suggest that he continued publishing under an assumed identity. Regardless, when a new revolution erupted in Petropavlovsk, Saken emerged from seclusion. Having aligned himself with Jangeldin, Seifullin proclaimed the revival of Jas Qazaq, a movement uniting national-communists, and at the inaugural congress of the Communist Party, he secured the support of delegates and assumed the position of chairman of the newly formed party."
POLITICS_AMANZHOLOV_SADYK_AYUKEVICH_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! August 28th, 1885, in Bakai volost, Semirechye Oblast, General Government of the Steppes, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Sadyq Amanjolov was born in Jetisu, near the city of Verny. The family noticed the boy's inclination to study and supported his desire to study away from home. After graduating from the men's gymnasium in Verny in 1907, he became a student of the law faculty of the Kazan Imperial University. In the fall of 1912, he had already taken up the duties of a junior candidate in the court of Verny district. During the difficult, critical period of the Weltkrieg, the Central Asian uprising and the Civil War, he was a judge of the arbitration court in Urjar, a town bordering Xinjiang, through which refugee flows passed in 1916-1918. Amanjolov witnessed many tragedies and did much to help Qazaqs on both sides of the border. As a deputy, he took part in the First All-Qazaq Congress held in Orenburg in July 1917. There he became better acquainted with many of his associates, members of the Alash party. The congress elected Amanjolov as a deputy to the All-Russian Constituent Assembly from Jetisu. He also became chairman of the Qazaq Committee of the Urjar district and was engaged in the formation of local branches of the Alash party in the Jetisu district. Amanjolov took an active part in the formation of armed detachments of the Alash militia. Events developed rapidly, and the militia units turned into an Alash army that opposed the Bolsheviks. In August 1918, during a battle with the Bolsheviks, Sadyq Amanjolov was seriously wounded. When Jetisu fell into the hands of the Bolsheviks, the Jetisu branch of Alash Orda went to Shaushek in Xinjiang. Amanjolov was engaged in creating a militia from the Qazaqs who had resettled there. They returned to Alash Orda only after the end of the war.\n\nAfter the death of Hamit Toqtamyshev, Amanjolov headed the Alash militia, local self-defense units that Russia allowed to exist. However, his dissatisfaction with the Cossack and Russian domination led him to become an active nationalist. Thanks to his efforts and those of his associates, almost the entire region of the autonomy, formerly part of Turkestan, became strongly national-oriented. In these lands, Alash's policies became more radical and aimed at desperately preserving Qazaq independence and traditions. Now, at the head of the entire nation, the Qazaq state would finally recover from the turmoil of the tumultuous years."

Initially hampered by vague ideology, small membership, and organizational weaknesses, Üsh-Jüz combined Russain SR and Islamist ideas, opposing the Alash party from the left. Internal conflicts led to a split between the right-wing faction led by Äitpenov, who was sympathetic to Alash, and the left-wing radical faction headed by Qölbay Tögusov.

Smagul Säduaqasov, the young leader of the organization advocated the creation of a new party with the same name, not embarrassed by the fact that he was the son-in-law of Älihan Bökeihan himself.

ALO_Land_Reform_desc: "Although land use in the aul was formally communal and tribal, and land was nationalized, the bai semi-feudals owned the best meadow and arable lands. They leased out many arable lands and meadows. Under the guise of helping a kin, the bai gave cattle for temporary use to a poor man with the condition that the latter, receiving a part of milk and wool, took good care of the cattle, took care of increasing their fatness, and watched over the litter. For his “favor” the bai interfered in the life of the poor man and his family and forced them to work for him for free. A common form of bai exploitation was “supryaga” (“urtachestvo”). A poor man who did not have his own working cattle or seeds entered into “suppryaga” with a bai. The bai gave the poor man working cattle or seeds, and the poor man was obliged to give half or sometimes two-thirds of the harvest to the bai. The latter was not interested in the transition to cultural methods of farming, in the application of new techniques and agronomic achievements. Neither could the poor peasant crushed by need start such innovations. Therefore, the agriculture of the steppe developed extremely slowly.

ALO_Independent_Muftiate_desc: "While we already tried to form an independent Muftiate for Kazaks during the Second All-Qazaq Congress, our efforts were in vain as long the Russians and their Orenburg Muftiate were in control. Now it's time to create an independent Muftiate for Qazaqs to oversee religious affairs, asserting Qazaq sovereignty over religious matters and ensuring autonomy from external influence."
ALO_Office_Of_Religious_Affairs: "Office of Religious Affairs"
ALO_Office_Of_Religious_Affairs_desc: "In our process of secularisation, we must create an Office of Religious Affairs to regulate and coordinate religious activities, promote interfaith dialogue, and uphold the principle of religious freedom while safeguarding national security and social cohesion."

ALO_Adopt_Alash_Constitution_desc: "With the advent of our independence and success, we can now focus our efforts into finally introducing a modern-day constitution, made by Qazaqs, for Qazaqs, that will enshrine our rights and freedoms. This is a major step forward for our nation, but it is only the first in many reforms that we will bring to ensure our political freedoms, away from the imperial yoke of Russia."
ALO_Increase_Ties_With_Jas_Azamat: "Young Citizens"
ALO_Increase_Ties_With_Jas_Azamat_desc: "Jaz Azamat, The Young Citizens, are a youth group that have been quite popular in recent years. Their policies and ideals strongly resemble our own, particularly when it comes to protecting national interests. It’s clear that have been useful in garnering support for us, so a closer alliance with them would not only increase our popularity, but also our political legacy."
ALO_One_Party_State: "One-Party State"
ALO_One_Party_State_desc: "It’s become clear that if we are to ensure the security of our nation, we must do so alone. These up-start parties have become little more than obstacles that seek to dismantle everything that we have been working towards for decades by this point. As such, it is vital that we ensure that the nation is steered solely by us, and that the other parties are kept at bay, by force if necessary."
ALO_Modernization_Of_Turkestan: "Modernization of Turkestan"
ALO_Modernization_Of_Turkestan_desc: "If you were to ask anyone from Europe what was the first thing that came up in their minds when they heard the word ‘Turkestan’, you would struggle to find any description that resembles a modern state. Of course, there’s no question why this is the case; the land has remained largely unchanged for hundreds of years. It needn’t be this way anymore - through proper funding and development of crucial infrastructure, we can soon show the world that Turkestan is worthy enough to belong in the modern age."
ALO_Ban_Ush_Juz: "Ban the Üsh-Jüz"
ALO_Ban_Ush_Juz_desc: "The Üsh-Jüz are perhaps our biggest and most competent rivals in the game of political dominion over Alash. Their left-nationalist ideology is incredibly popular with both the far-left and those who do not generally agree with our ideological views or policies. We cannot be certain that they will not try to enact some coup against us either, so it is not enough to simply bar them from leadership. We must look to ban the group entirely, and cut out its roots before it can blossom into something we cannot afford to deal with."
ALO_Finish_Off_Tribalism: "Finish Off Tribalism"
ALO_Finish_Off_Tribalism_desc: "For too long, our nation has been held back by archaic traditions and systems that have proven themselves useless in today’s age. Even though we have made great advancements for the nation and our culture, we are still being held back by ideas that are ludicrous for a modern state. Why must we continue to divide ourselves by fanciful titles and categories, when we are all one Qazaq people? The sooner we wipe out all aspects of tribalism - nomadism and all - the better."
ALO_Strong_Ties_With_Porta: "Strong Ties With [TUR.Capital.GetName]"

It would be beneficial for the both of us if we maintained good connections and friendly relations."
ALO_Dominion_Of_Russia: "Friendship With Russia"
ALO_Dominion_Of_Russia_desc: "Controversial as it may be, perhaps the best move for Qazaqs is to actually offer an olive branch to the Russians and rekindle, at the very least, an alliance with them. If they do accept such a proposal, there is no doubt that they will demand certain allowances within the nation. As unthinkable as it might sound, it is a better idea than the alternative; isolating ourselves from the rest of the world amidst its inevitable descent into war."
ALO_Unity_Of_Turkic_State: "Lead the Turkic Parade"
ALO_Unity_Of_Turkic_State_desc: "In spite of our differences, we as well as all the other nations of Central Asia, are Turkic first and foremost. It does not matter if you are Qazaq, Turkmen, Qyrgyz, or whatever else. Even if we may fight and bicker over religion, ideology, or territory, it is still this fact that binds us all as one people. We must work towards emphasising this fact, and act as the spearhead of the Turkic global community in order to unite our fellow nations under one clear identity."
ALO_Ties_With_RKMT: "White Sun Above Us"
ALO_Ties_With_RKMT_desc: "The leaders of the Right Kuomintang are our natural allies. They also understand the need for unity among the people, and their ideas are just.

ALO_Develop_Academy_Of_Science: "Develop Academy of Science"
ALO_Develop_Academy_Of_Science_desc: "Science has unfortunately been an underrated field in our history. But our potential for great changes is readily apparent, particularly in the fields of agricultural technology and geology. As such, it is only right that we support our growing scientific community with an academy of their own, with the latest equipment and facilities necessary, funded by the state and all. It is not just a matter of pride either - whatever developments they may achieve will directly support the state, proving itself as a worthwhile investment."

ALO_Support_Siberian_Independence: "Support Oblastnik Movement"
ALO_Support_Siberian_Independence_desc: "The independence of Siberia was an idea unheard of only a few decades ago. Since the Russian Civil War, however, there has been an increasing number of these Oblastniks garnering support, encouraged by the situation in Transamur especially. Some of their representatives have even ended up here, asking for our support in whatever way we can offer. It is a dangerous bet, especially if the Russians were to find out about our involvement, but the trade-off could see a true ally to our north be formed, keeping the bear off our backs for as long as it takes."

ALO_Fight_Political_Centralism: "Fight Alash Centralism"
ALO_Fight_Political_Centralism_desc: "After the establishment of the Qazaq state, the Alash party was a monopoly in governing the country. Many people not only supported the first Qazaq party, but also actively imposed its power in all regions of the country. For many over the decades, Alash became the personification of Qazaqs. Zhas Azamat was once inseparable from Alash, but new times have come. We must return to the Qazaqs the idea that Alash is only one of the parties representing their interests. Centralization of all structures, authorities, armed forces and culture around the Alash party must be stopped!"

ALO_Place_A_Bet: "Place a Bet"

While this deep-rooted tradition has been a source of pride, it has also been a cause of division.

To secure the nation's prosperity, we must move forward as a united Kazakh people, ensuring equality among all clans."
ALO_Integrate_Cossack_Regions: "Integrate the Cossack Regions"
ALO_Integrate_Cossack_Regions_desc: "It is a point of contention that portions of our nation are occupied by cossack hosts that hold no real fealty to our central government.

Though decried as some kind of proto or pseudo Syndicalism by his most vocal detractors, Säduaqasov knows the truth as he foresees a future paradise under this moderate socialist system where all Qazaqs can prosper. As such, he shall now bring this dream to reality before the eyes of his very countrymen as Säduaqasov seeks to gradually transform Qazaq society along these Owenite lines through peaceful, parliamentary means. With Säduaqasov as our guide, all of Qazaq society shall be transformed as we eliminate exploitation and oppression peacefully, and without leaning on the Marxist crutch of class struggle, instead focusing on the Owenite revolutionary catalyst that is class collaboration and cooperation, for only together can all Qazaqs reach utopia."

ALO_Army_Leadership_Center_desc: "Our Soviet brothers are the ones who have sparked the fires of revolution in 1917, all the while supporting us greatly in our efforts to bring the light of the Red Star to the wide steppes. We would be foolish to refuse further cooperation with them in strengthening socialism in the East, and to that, we shall request the Soviet High Command in assisting our formation of the newly formed Kazakh Red Army, to create a new, professional armed force, all the while unifying our doctrines into a cohesive whole."
ALO_Reform_Ural_Military_Real_School: "Reform the Uralsk Military Real School"
ALO_Reform_Ural_Military_Real_School_desc: "The Uralsk Military Real School was once a prestigious institution, producing generations of skilled officers for the Russian army. While its past is tied to the Tsarist and reactionary forces, the infrastructure and knowledge it holds can be repurposed for the service of the revolution. By reforming the school under new ideological guidelines, we will train a new cadre of commanders loyal to socialism and capable of leading our Kazakh Red Army in the struggles to come."

ALO_Increased_Agitation: "Increase Agitation Among Muslims"
ALO_Increased_Agitation_desc: "In these wide steppes, the religion of the Crescent Moon and Star held a special status, being the dominant religion of the Kazakh people. While we cannot sway the people towards socialist enlightenment immediately, through further agitation with the Muslim populations, especially through our renewed cooperation with leftist Jadidist cells will further cement socialist ideals within the population and align them with our cause, but more importantly, this will motivate the Muslim population towards joining our ranks within the newly reestablished Red Army, alleviating some of our current manpower issues."
ALO_Propaganda_Socialist_Motherland: "Propaganda for the “Socialist Motherland”"
ALO_Propaganda_Socialist_Motherland_desc: "The Kazakh people must understand that our revolution is not just about class struggle but also about the defense of our new socialist motherland. Through a widespread propaganda campaign, we shall inspire workers and peasants to take up arms in defense of their homeland, tying socialist ideals to national pride. This effort will strengthen the resolve of our soldiers and ensure that every comrade understands that socialism and the defense of our land go hand in hand."
ALO_Begin_Mobilization: "Start Mobilization into the Red Army"
ALO_Begin_Mobilization_desc: "While the nucleus of a proper Kazakh Red Army has been formed, it remained understaffed from its hasty formation, while many of the partisan formations that nominally fought for the Revolution have effectively been operating autonomously, retaining their personnel outside of our jurisdiction. This sorry state of affairs is unacceptable, and we must encourage further mobilization into the Red Army, to resolve this shortage and to slowly reintegrate these autonomous units back into the armed forces."

ALO_Rearguard_Of_Red_Army: "Rear-Guard of the Red Army"
ALO_Rearguard_Of_Red_Army_desc: "With generous guidance from our fraternal socialist brother to the North, the newly minted Kazakh Red Army has been reorganized into a professional fighting force, in full synergy with the wider Workers and Peasants’ Red Army. Through our fraternal cooperation, the frontiers of the socialist fatherland, from Vladivostok to Almaty have been secured, and the Kazakh people shall be the rear-guard for Soviet Russia in the defence against the encroaching storms ahead."
ALO_Advanced_Guard_Of_Soviet_Orient: "Advanced-Guard of the Soviet Orient"
ALO_Advanced_Guard_Of_Soviet_Orient_desc: "Through our own hard work, utilizing our own local expertise against previous foes, the Kazakh Red Army has been transformed into a cohesive, mobile and versatile fighting force, tailored to our material conditions. With such a mighty force, we can finally look outwards, towards our fellow oppressed brothers in Turkestan and the rest of the Near East, for we are the first to liberate ourselves from the chains of capital, and such, we shall be the vanguard of a new, Soviet order of the Orient."

ALO_russian_pressure_desc: "Although the Russians have lost much of their control over our affairs due to their own internal struggles, they still possess a great deal of economic, cultural and political influence over our lands."

ALO_cossack_garrison: "Shadow of the Cossacks"
ALO_cossack_garrison_desc: "The fate of the Siberian, Orenburg, Ural and Semirechye Cossacks is inextricably linked to that of our people. This relationship is complex, with periods of both hostility and support. The Cossacks suppressed the 1916 uprising, but they also helped to create combat-ready units of the Alash militia. The Cossacks stood for a united and indivisible Russia, yet they helped to create the Alash Autonomy. Currently, all these Cossack Hosts are stationed on the territory of our autonomy, and they do not obey the central government. As long as we are weak, we  lack the capacity to challenge their fiefdoms. However, if we were to turn against Russia, the shadows of Atamans Dutov, Tolstov and Ionov would be revealed once again..."
ALO_land_troubles: "Struggle For Land"
ALO_land_troubles_desc: "One of the main demands of Alash leaders during the revolutionary years was to return the illegally seized land to Qazaqs and stop the colonial yoke of Russia, which existed at the expense of resettlement of peasants in the fertile lands of the North. In some areas where the Qazaq population traditionally predominated, Russian settlers have since become the majority. Although the land was nationalized by the Bolsheviks, in the Steppe only the lands of the royal family, officials and the largest Bais, some agricultural and industrial capitalist associations were confiscated. In the auls the land was already under communal management, though the semi-feudal Bais owned the arable lands, best pastures, and water.\nAfter all, while Alash leaders sought land rights, the Russian authorities blocked it. Today, reclaiming land is paramount, necessitating resolution of settler conflicts and restoration of Qazaq ownership."
ALO_legacy_of_central_asian_revolt: "Echoes of 1916 Uprising"
ALO_legacy_of_central_asian_revolt_desc: "The decades under Russian hegemony left their scars on our culture, as evidenced by the 1916 Central Asian Revolt. The price for freedom was high, with massacres, deportations, and devastated populations being just a few of the consequences. A significant portion of our population was either exterminated or deported from Central Asia, with many forced to seek refuge in the Xinjiang. Yet, the bitter memory of its failure and the ensuing consequences fuels the flames of Qazaq nationalism. We must ensure that such senseless bloodshed never haunts our land again."

### Events ###

alash.1.t: "White Sun of the Desert"
alash.1.d: "In the summer of 1917, a group of Qazaq intellectuals convened at the First All-Qazaq Congress, where they formally separated from the Cadet Party. They subsequently established the Alash Party, which espoused the principles of universal suffrage, equality, and parliamentary federalism. The Alash Party's vision for the future of the Qazaq people was one of autonomy within the Russian state. Following the October Revolution, Alash leaders condemned the Bolshevik coup and at the Second All-Qazaq Congress in December 1917 established a national Qazaq autonomy, Alash Orda, amidst anarchist unrest and the Bolshevik threat. The People's Council of Alash Orda was headed by Älihan Bökeihan, the permanent leader of the party and the nation to this day.\n\nOn June 11, 1918, the decree of Alash Orda was solemnly adopted, condemning the power of the Soviet government and asserting the sovereignty of the Qazaq people. With the assistance of allied Cossack Hosts, the Reds were subdued in Alash territory, although pockets of resistance persisted until the end of 1919. However, the aspiration for autonomy was ultimately suppressed. Despite initially cordial relations with the leaders of the White Army, the coup led by Kolchak ultimately derailed the federalization program, reducing Alash Orda to a subordinate position in the bosom of the reviving Russia.\n\nAt the Constituent Assembly in 1920, Alash Orda was restored as an autonomous territory of Russia, subordinate to it in almost all matters. However, it retained its own parliament, with a certain freedom in cultural and national affairs, as well as in economic policy, without regard to constitutional rights to private property. Many of the aspirations of the national leaders were not realized, and Alash Orda in reality remained part of the “indivisible Russia”. The Alash party established close ties with the government in Petrograd and President Kerensky. However, there was growing discontent within the state and an increasing number of voices calling for change within the party."
alash.1.a: "Interesting"

alash.899.t: "Alash Party & Halyq Keńesi"
alash.899.d: "Since 1917, the country has been ruled by Älihan Bökeihan, leader of the Alash Party, a close associate of Kerensky, the father of the Qazaq state. The country's parliament is the Halyq Keńesi, or People's Council, largely modeled on the Russian Duma. Elections are synchronized with the Russian elections, and the Minister-President of Alash Autonomy is appointed by the parliament. For many years, the People's Council has remained virtually one-party, as the Alash Party leads the parliament nearly undisputed.\n\nAmong the opposition to the ruling regime are Jas Azamat - formerly the youth branch of Alash, but now a full-fledged social-democrat party with little representation in the parliament; the Üsh-Jüz - affiliated with Left and center-left Russian SRs; and the Orenburg Cossacks - having their target quotas in the National Council based on the 1926 Orenburg Treaty."
alash.899.a: "Wake up, Qazaq!"

alash.897.t: "Assassination of President Kerensky"
alash.897.d: "Alarming news reached our capital from Petrograd, where a few hours ago President Kerensky, a friend and associate of Älihan Bökeihan, an associate and great supporter of Alash autonomy, who had done much for federal Russia, was killed.\n\nThe terrorist murderer should undoubtedly pay for his deeds, but it seems that Kerensky was the one who was able to hold the delicate balance of Russian politics in his hands, and now everything has gone into tatters. While chaos reigns in Russia, the Alash autonomy has declared mourning for the Russian president and has lowered both Russian and Alash flags."
alash.897.a: "He can be criticized, but could you be in his shoes?"

alash.895.t: "Rumors of Älihan Bökeihan's Resignation"
alash.895.d.death: "Today rumors reached the government of the Alash Orda that Älihan Bökeihan, deeply saddened by the death of his friend... President Kerensky, and also probably taking his age into account, intends to resign, for the first time allowing a new man to take the honorable place of Minister-President of the young Qazaq democracy.\n\nSo far, however, there has been no official confirmation of such information, but rumors soon leaked out to the media, and many Qazaqs read in the morning papers that the father of the nation was preparing to leave his post.\n\nIn a sense, the unprecedented excitement over such news prompted members of the media to contact the government for comment, after which a press release was announced at which Bökeihan was scheduled to speak.\n\nOn the appointed morning, a conference of the most influential acting ministers was assembled, headed by Älihan Bökeihan himself, who announced the beginning of a new era for the Alash autonomy. The Father of the Nation spoke at length about the possibilities for modernizing and improving the living conditions of ordinary Qazaqs, and finally, at the end of his speech, made an important announcement, finally putting an end to all the rumors surrounding his resignation."
alash.895.d.age: "Today rumors reached the government of the Alash Orda that Älihan Bökeihan, probably taking his age into account, intends to resign, for the first time allowing a new man to take the honorable place of Prime Minister of the young Qazaq democracy.\n\nSo far, however, there has been no official confirmation of such information, but rumors soon leaked out to the media, and many Qazaqs read in the morning papers that the father of the nation was preparing to leave his post.\n\nIn a sense, the unprecedented excitement over such news prompted members of the media to contact the government for comment, after which a press release was announced at which Bökeihan was scheduled to speak.\n\nOn the appointed morning, a conference of the most influential acting ministers was assembled, headed by Älihan Bökeihan himself, who announced the beginning of a new era for the Alash autonomy.

alash.895.b: "The rumors are confirmed and Bökeihan resigns..."

alash.894.t: "Gold Mining Joint Stock Company \"Altai\""
alash.894.d: "The Gold Mining Joint Stock Company \"Altai\", originally a Russian enterprise established in 1915, has undergone significant changes since its inception. Initially managed from Petrograd, the company focused on gold mining in the [404.GetName] and [402.GetName] regions. It acquired properties from the trading house \"V. M. Fonyakov and Co.\" and expanded its operations to include mines in [404.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and Zaisan counties of [810.GetName] region, and later in [583.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_10284] uyezd of [402.GetName] region. Annually, the company produced approximately 25 pounds of gold. The Chairman of the Board was L.R. Gaveman, also known for managing the Yusupov family's assets.\n\nWith the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, all assets of the Altai Gold Industry Company were nationalized, listed among the \"largest enterprises\" subjected to state control. However, after the civil war, a law was passed under which mining companies could be partially privatized provided that a controlling interest was held by the state and the state had the right to anytime nationalize the company. Altai was partially privatized in this way, and while we had exclusive rights to own the nationalized part of the company, since the resources were located precisely on our territory, the management was still from Petrograd.\n\nSignificant economic shifts followed, including the introduction of the gold-backed Chervonets Ruble in Russia and its subsequent abandonment due to the economic crisis and the collapse of the Berlin Stock Exchange. This economic instability led to a diminished interest in the Altai Gold Mining Joint Stock Company from Russian authorities. Recognizing an opportunity, the government plans to assert greater control over the company. With the waning Russian interest, this moment is ideal to restructure the board of the company, ensuring that a reliable and trustworthy individual is appointed to oversee operations and prevent the flow of gold out of [ROOT.GetName]."
alash.894.a: "This is our gold."

alash.8940.d: "The gold mining joint stock company Altai, a key player in the gold mining industry, has historically been managed with significant Russian participation. Despite the nationalization of the company by the Bolsheviks, a law was passed after the Civil War under which mining companies could be partially privatized provided that a controlling interest was held by the state and the state had the right to anytime nationalize the company. Altai was partially privatized in this way, as were many other companies in the country. The situation was complicated by the fact that according to our constitution, the Alash autonomy as a subject of the federation had exclusive rights to own the nationalized part of the company, since the resources were located precisely on its territory.\n\nThe recent abandonment of the gold standard, caused by the economic crisis and the collapse of the Berlin Stock Exchange, reduced the interest of our beneficial shareholders in Altai JSC, in connection with which they agreed to a deal with the Alash authorities. However, the strategic importance of the gold reserve of Semipalatinsk and Turgai regions is still great. Realizing that an opportunity had arisen, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government established greater control over the company by restructuring the company's board of directors, thus eliminating any possibility of “a hand from Petrograd to get into their gold reserves”."

# Russia goes Snap Elections #
alash.893.t: "Extraordinary Elections Announced!"
alash.893.d: "In connection with the death of President Kerensky, general elections were announced in Russia, and our autonomy, as part of a federal republic, was also obliged to hold them. Usually the Qazaq population predominantly voted for the Alash party, and we even won a significant number of deputies in the all-Russian Duma, but in recent years, due to the growing popularity of Üsh-Jüz and Jas Azamat, which form unified lists with candidates from Russian parties, our majoritarianism was lost.\n\nIn general, the interest of the Qazaq population to the all-Russian elections has faded, and the turnout is quite low, but the Russians and Cossack migrants vote for Russian parties, and in recent years their support has changed towards right-wing nationalist parties, such as NRPR and VNS. We must keep an eye on these elections and not allow non-indigenous Russians to represent our autonomy in the Russian parliament."

alash.892.d: "In connection with Bökeihan's resignation and the scheduling of elections to the Halyq Keńesi in the near future, the Alash Party convened a congress to elect a candidate from the party who would become prime minister and form the government.\n\nIn recent years, the party has lost much in unity and cohesion, and is now in fact no longer a party but a coalition of political cliques. On the left flank, the Alash party is represented by a group of politicians who did not leave the party after the formation of Jas Azamat, united under the leadership of Jahansha Dosmukhamedov. They are quite radical in their policy, intending to reform the party from within and drastically change inequality. The progressive wing of the party is represented by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, a close associate of Bökeihan, who was predicted to be his successor, but his radicalism and strong personal power base alienated the more moderate Alash members, who preferred the more pragmatic Yermekov. The moderate centrists are represented precisely by him, Bökeihan's \"named\" successor, who has secured the support of the Alash Party establishment, and who serves as the \"voice of Reason\" of the party. Politicians who want to preserve the status quo and are afraid of rocking the boat are united around him. Finally, opposed on the right is Sadyq Amanjolov - head of the Alash Militia, a military leader and defender of the Qazaq people, a nationalist who advocates the development of the army and finally the separation from Russia, prophesied by the Central Asian uprising of 1916.\n\nDespite all factions vying for power, only the two centrist candidates have a chance to win the party's primaries."

However, the question arises if we should stay loyal to the Russian Volunteer Army, led by Lavr Kornilov, the government, based in Volgograd. While their government is likely to fight for united and indivisible Russia, we have previously agreed to become an autonomy."
alash.890.d2: "Revolution happens in Russia, and once again their government has attempted to build a society for the workers and peasants.

alash.888.t: "Alash Unity Under Threat"
alash.888.d: "The once united Alash party has long since cracked, but now the split has only intensified after a candidate from a single bloc of political cliques was elected in the primaries. All factions, except for the winning one, were dissatisfied with the results, and are already openly declaring distrust of the Alash Central Committee and the new candidate. \n\nSupporters of the winning candidate assure that only Älihan Bökeihan can save the situation, who should name a successor himself and thereby unite the party, probably for the last time, but skeptics state that the party unity died once and for all, and nothing will help him, so it is easier to just admit it as a fact."

It is the symbolic importance of Älihan that will be important, and perhaps in this way the candidate he names will be able to gain popularity with the people and seize the initiative in the future.\n\nNevertheless, the name named will hardly come as a surprise to everyone. Earlier, Bökeihan worked closely with Dulatuly, but times have changed and for the past six years another party member, Älimhan Yermekov, has firmly established a nickname of successor. That is why, when the aged father of the nation uttered the cherished name, the delegates did not breathe a sigh of relief, but only realized that the time of struggle had just begun. Yermekov did become the named successor of Bökeihan, but whether it would somehow affect the unity of the party - rather for the worse."

Party unity is practically at zero, but those who disagree with the results of the vote for a candidate are outraged and do not seem to allow him to be elected.\n\nThat is why in fact all 4 candidates took part in the race for the Prime Minister's seat and deployed their campaign headquarters.\n\nJahansha Dosmukhamedov, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, Älimhan Yermekov and Sadyq Amanjolov - for the first time 4 candidates were nominated from Alash party and for the first time it was not Älihan Bökeihan. These elections promise to be interesting, but the most frightening thing for Alash, which held power for many years, is whether such clear split in the party is a tidbit and good timing for the opposition, which is increasing its power and offers people an alternative.

However, this electoral season has brought unprecedented challenges to their influence. The party's central leadership hesitates to fully support the Dosmukhamedovs, leaving their campaign vulnerable to internal and external pressures. Adding to the complexity is the presence of Vladimir Tolstov, the Ataman of the Ural Cossack Host. Tolstov, a staunch opponent of democracy and Qazaq sovereignty, has consistently undermined the young Qazaq democracy in the west of the country. His malign influence now manifests in attempts to disrupt the upcoming elections. The Cossacks, under his command, plan to block polling stations in [ALO_guryev_kazakh] and intimidate Qazaq voters to thwart the electoral process. The central leadership could decide to back Jahansha Dosmukhamedov by injecting significant funds into the region to bolster his campaign. This financial support would enable the left-wing faction to effectively counter Tolstov's disruptive tactics and secure their electoral base. The government could also decide to introduce Alash Militia troops into the [ALO_guryev_kazakh] to secure polling stations and ensure a fair election process."

Without the necessary funds and strategic backing, Jahansha's campaign struggled to counteract the disruptive efforts of Ataman Vladimir Tolstov and the Cossacks. Taking full advantage of this situation, the Cossacks intensified their efforts to block polling stations and intimidate Qazaq voters. These tactics proved effective, leading to a significant suppression of voter turnout among the local Qazaq population. As a result, the Cossacks managed to secure a dominant position in the region, significantly undermining the influence of the Alash Party.\n\nFaced with this setback, Jahansha Dosmukhamedov sought alternative alliances to maintain his political relevance.

The presence of nationalist-minded Alash Militia heightened tensions with the local Cossack forces, leading to a series of violent clashes that rapidly escalated beyond the initial scope of electoral security. Seeking external assistance, the Alash government may request intervention from the Russian government to stabilize the situation, which, however, can increase influence and control by Russia over our internal affairs. On the other hand, Sadyq Amanjolov, head of the Militia, suggests declaring martial law in [ALO_guryev_kazakh], imposing strict military control to quell the violence and restore order."

However, the influence of the Alash party is under significant threat due to the actions of Ataman Vladimir Tolstov of the Ural Cossack Host. Tolstov and his followers, opponents of democracy and Qazaq sovereignty, have been intimidating voters and attempting to disrupt the electoral process to maintain their grip on power. In response, the Alash government introduced its Militia into the region to secure polling stations. This move has resulted in clashes and the situation has spiraled out of control, prompting the Alash government to request Russian intervention to stabilize the region and ensure the integrity of the elections.

Reinforcements and supplies have been sent to bolster Ataman Tolstov and his followers. With Russian support, the Cossacks quickly gain the upper hand in the clashes with the Alash Militia. Emboldened by Russian backing, they launch a series of operations to suppress Qazaq opposition. The ongoing conflict severely disrupts the electoral process. Many Qazaq voters are too intimidated to participate, leading to a significant decrease in voter turnout and calls for the elections to be postponed or annulled."

However, surprisingly the decision to impose martial law has been met with outrage across the country. Opposition parties and civilian groups have organized protests, condemning the government's actions as undemocratic and authoritarian. Major cities, including [590.GetName] and [404.GetName], have seen large-scale demonstrations. The Üsh-Jüz party has capitalized on the unrest, using the martial law decision to discredit the Alash government. Their leaders have been vocal in denouncing the government's actions, gaining significant support from those disillusioned by the heavy-handed tactics. While the move has cost the Alash government support in many regions, it has also bolstered Amanjolov's standing among nationalist voters.

While we must remember that the region is quite unstable, being on the border with Turkestan, as well as hosting Semirechye Cossacks. If we get it out of our control, it can cost us yet another problems.

Initially calling for support of the Alash Orda against the Bolsheviks, Jas Azamat rapidly evolved into an unofficial youth wing of the Alash Party. In 1922, Smagul Säduaqasov, a dynamic and ambitious young leader, was appointed as the organization's leader at the age of 21. Two years later, Säduaqasov's marriage to Yelizaveta Bökeihan, daughter of Alash Party leader and Minister-President Älihan Bökeihan, further solidified the connection between Jas Azamat and the Alash Party.\n\nHowever, as federalization of Alash Orda progressed and factionalism grew within the party, Säduaqasov became the first prominent figure to declare \"independence\" from the Alash leadership. Jas Azamat established itself as an independent party, still supporting the Alash government but not fully endorsing it. Embracing radical progressive ideas, the party pushed for modernization in the economy — something the Alash government struggled to achieve due to various constraints. Säduaqasov's vision of developing highways, railways, land reform, and unitarization did not resonate with the Alash leadership.\n\nIn the most recent elections, Jas Azamat secured 11 seats in the Halyq Keńesi, in addition to numerous victories in zemstvas, particularly in the north where they enjoyed majority support.\n\nToday, at the congress in [590.GetName], held amid great anticipation, Smagul Säduaqasov was nominated as the party's main candidate for Minister-President.

The party, organized by some dissatisfied Qazaq intellectuals, initially struggled due to its vague ideology, small size, and weak organization. Despite these setbacks, the party's amalgamation of Social Revolutionary and Islamic traditionalist ideas gradually resonated more with Qazaq society.\n\nHowever, Üsh-Jüz's reputation was marred by its early support from the Bolsheviks, seen as an alternative to the Alash. The Alash Party capitalized on every opportunity to discredit Üsh-Jüz, leading to the execution of one of its leaders, Qölbay Tögusov, by the Russian Whites, and the arrest of Müqan Äitpenov, who spent several years in prison. After receiving an amnesty from President Kerensky, Äitpenov returned to Alash Orda to re-establish Üsh-Jüz.\n\nThis time, the Alash government was unable to suppress the resurgence of Üsh-Jüz. The party was re-established and received support from the Turkestan socialists of the ERK party and the Left SR party in Russia. Üsh-Jüz, now a formidable opponent to Alash, began to publish its party newspaper again, leveling harsh criticisms and insults against the leaders of the Autonomy. A significant figure in popularizing Üsh-Jüz was Qajymuqan Munaitpasuly, a world-famous circus performer and wrestler who had supported the party since its inception. His endorsement brought significant attention and credibility to the party.\n\nIn [590.GetName], the party announced the start of its electoral campaign, promoting its social-nationalist program. The campaign began with a rally attended by numerous supporters and onlookers curious about the party's platform and as the strongest man of Alash Orda, Qajymuqan, led the demonstration with a red flag in his hand, it became clear that Üsh-Jüz has returned to make itself known."

The party can choose to align itself with Jas Azamat or focus on its own campaign efforts to secure votes in [590.GetName]. While the majority of the party's leaders believe that they should support Jas Azamat, who is currently leading in the polls, and risk losing the city to him, a slight minority believes that it would be more beneficial to secure this city for the Alash Party."

Historically, this community was founded by Ukrainian settlers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in search of new opportunities and lands. Over time, Grey Ukraine developed into a significant and influential enclave. The center of the diaspora was Omsk, where in 1917 the All-Ukrainian Council of Siberia was formed. On the territory of our autonomy, the [590.GetName] Ukrainian Rada and its chairman V. Nagirnyi have a special influence.\n\nUkrainian settlers brought with them a rich cultural heritage, including their language, traditions, and agricultural practices. They established thriving farms, schools, and cultural centers, creating a network that preserved their identity. Despite successful settlement, the Ukrainian community in Alash-Orda faces a number of challenges. Economic pressures, cultural preservation, and political representation are ongoing challenges for the residents of Grey Ukraine. Recent trends in the views of Qazaq politicians are to deprive these colonizers of a presence in Qazaq lands, in a similar vein as they plan to do with their Russian counterparts."

The program and charter of the Ittifoqi Muslimin emphasize strict adherence to Sharia law, the promotion of national religious values, and the economic support of madrasas.\n\nDuring the current electoral campaign, Ittifoqi Muslimin has focused on promoting the nationalist candidate, leveraging their extensive network and effective propaganda strategies. Their efforts have yielded significant results, with the Alash Party observing a noticeable shift in voter sentiment.

A member of the Qypşaq clan and a descendant of the notable Qazaq bai Niyaz Tileuiūly, Janbosynūly received a solid Islamic education and devoted much of his early life to farming, irrigation, and education, even establishing a school in his aul.\n\nWith the onset of the 1916 revolt, Janbosynūly was proclaimed Khan of the Qypşaq Qazaqs. He commanded the eastern half of the rebellion, while Ospan Şolaqūly led the western half under the Argyn clan. Despite his nominal political leadership, Janbosynūly delegated most authority to an elected council of twenty representatives, a system that came to be known as 'Steppe Democracy'. His focus remained primarily on military affairs. On 22 October 1916, Janbosynūly's forces besieged Torğai. However, the siege was abandoned in favor of direct confrontation with Russian troops. Following this, his troops strategically retreated to Batbakkara, engaging in guerrilla warfare. During this period, Şolaqūly's forces suffered a defeat at the hands of the Russians, while Janbosynūly continued to resist until the February Revolution prompted his troops to stand down.\n\nPost-revolt, Janbosynūly remained active in the political turmoil of the Russian Civil War, helping to establish Soviet power in Orenburg. However, his alliance with the Bolsheviks was short-lived, leading him to join forces with the Alash Militia. In the ensuing years, he became a supporter of the Üsh-Jüz party, though his political activities were limited.\n\nNow, in his sixties, Janbosynūly's role shifted significantly. Organizing a congress in Torğai, he formally declared his support for Üsh-Jüz and called upon all Batyrs to join the party. His commitment to the party was further solidified with an invitation to join the Üsh-Jüz Central Committee. This development is seen as a unifying moment for many nationalists, who now find a common platform in Üsh-Jüz under Janbosynūly's influential leadership."

alash.1300.t: "The Rule of the Young Citizens"
alash.1300.d: "Following the victory of the Jas Azamat party in the national elections, the first ever victory of another party, rather than Alash, a grand rally was held in [810.GetName], marking the beginning of a new era for the [ROOT.GetName]. The newly elected Minister-President, Smagul Säduaqasov, addressed the crowd, outlining the party’s main aims for the years to come. First off, the critical need to address the problem of federalization within the country. He highlighted the existing divisions — between East and West, Turkestan and the Steppe — and underscored the importance of national unity. Säduaqasov declared that preventing tribal discord and regional feuds was paramount. He called for all Qazaqs to come together as a united nation and country, stressing that the strength of the nation lies in its unity.\n\nThe second major aim outlined was the need to deal with the entrenched establishment. For decades, the Alash party had monopolized governance, becoming synonymous with Qazaq identity. While Jas Azamat had once been inseparable from Alash, new times called for the necessity to break the centralization of all structures, authorities, armed forces, and cultural institutions around the Alash party.\n\nThe rally ended, and the new page is opened for the Qazaq state."
alash.1300.a: "We hope our rule will bring Qazaqs much-needed prosperity and enlightenment."

alash.1299.t: "Your Bets, Gentlemen"
alash.1299.d: "The split within the Alash party has become more than obvious. Different factions are fighting for power, privileges, and the loyalty of their supporters among the elites, not only within the party but also in state bodies. For our leadership it becomes obvious that there may not be a definitive winner in this internal struggle.\n\nFour main factions vie for dominance within Alash: the left-wing of Jahansha Dosmuhamedov, the radical wing of Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, and the moderate wing of Älimhan Yermekov, and the nationalists of Sadyq Amanjolov.\n\nThe Alash Left, led by Dosmuhamedov, lean towards more progressive policies and social reforms, which could align well with some of our goals. However, they are known federalists, who controlled the Oyil Vilayat for decades and want to preserve their autonomy. The Alash Radicals, under Dulatuly, are known for their strong nationalist stance and uncompromising attitude towards foreign influence. They are, however, even more radical in their modernization program, than us, largely due to the influence of the reforms of Mustafa Kemal, Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, on the views of Dulatuly. The Alash Moderates, headed by Yermekov, advocate for stability and gradual reforms. They also are seeking to retain good relations with Russia."
alash.1299.d2: "$alash.1299.d$\n\nThe most interesting is that our leadership views all factions equally as the establishment - the people who added to centralisation of power in the hands of their own party. Perhaps, instead of attempting to mend a fractured party, we can let the Alash factions bleed while positionin ourselves as the stable and unifying force the country needed."
alash.1299.a: "We need weaker allies - Dosmuhamedov and his supporters."
alash.1299.b: "We need strong allies - Dulatuly and his radicals."

alash.1299.e: "We don't need allies - time of Alash is up!"

alash.1298.t: "Land Reform Initiative"
alash.1298.d: "Historically, Qazaqs had suffered significant land expropriations during the Russian Empire's expansion. Settlers, supported by Cossack troops, seized fertile lands traditionally used by Qazaq nomads for grazing. This had left many Qazaq families landless or with insufficient land to sustain their livelihoods. The aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the ensuing civil strife further complicated land ownership. Many settlers and Cossacks still held large tracts of land, while returning Qazaqs found themselves struggling to reclaim their ancestral territories. One of the unrealized ambition of the Alash national movement was to seize the lands, colonized by the Russians and return them back to the Qazaqs.\n\nThe Jas Azamat government has now established a Land Reform Commission to tackle these disparities. The commission's mandate included a thorough inventory of all land plots across Alash Orda, evaluating the current status of land owned by settlers, Cossacks, and Biys. The main question is however what to do with the land afterwards - should we establish a quota system to ensure equitable land distribution, or outright seize all settler lands."

alash.1296.d: "Smagul Säduaqasov launched an ambitious youth policy inspired by his own experience and outlined in his influential brochure “For Youth - a New Path”. In this document, Säduaqasov emphasized the crucial role of youth in shaping the future and developing a collective national consciousness. Drawing on the experience of the Birlik (Unity) organization during his studies at the Omsk Agricultural School, he sought to harness the energy and potential of the younger generation to bring about social and cultural transformation. Säduaqasov believes that the key to prosperity and unity [ROOT.GetName] lies in the active participation of youth.\n\nOne of the central aspects of Säduaqasov's youth policy will be the promotion of modern education. He urged young Kazakhs to pursue higher education and acquire the modern knowledge and skills that are necessary for the progress of the nation. Säduaqasov's public speeches on the subject were characterized by fierce criticism of the ignorance and unscrupulousness of the older generation, which made him a revered figure among the youth. His unwavering stance and articulate arguments provided clear guidance to young leaders, inspiring them to make systematic and organized efforts in their communities.\n\nTo awaken the civic consciousness of the masses, Säduaqasov emphasizes the need for young people to learn non-traditional professions and engage in various activities. This approach allows them to move away from familiar roles and stimulates innovation and creativity among the youth, which ultimately contributes to the economic and cultural development of [ROOT.GetName]."
alash.1296.a: "For youth - a new path!"

alash.1295.t: "Rise of the Patriotic Youth"
alash.1295.d: "Inspired by Säduaqasov's vision and leadership, young Qazaqs began to unite in a patriotic youth organization known as Jas Búrkitter (Young Eagles). The founding meeting of Jas Búrkitter was held in the bustling town of [1203.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Young Qazaqs from different regions dressed in traditional attire gathered in a large yurt erected in the center of the city for this special occasion. It was decided that the group would have local chapters in every major city and region, each headed by elected representatives. The organization's activities would focus on three main areas: education, cultural preservation, and civic engagement.\n\nIn the following months, local chapters of Jas Búrkitter sprang up all over the country. In both villages and urban centers, young Qazaqs began to meet regularly, organizing study groups, cultural events and community service projects. Civic engagement became perhaps the most transformative aspect of Jas Búrkitter's mission. Members of the organization took on projects to improve their communities and participated in local government, ensuring that young people's voices were heard in the decision-making process.\n\nOne significant project was the construction of a new school in the village of Torğai. Funded and built entirely by members of Jas Búrkitter, the school has become a symbol of what young Qazaqs can achieve through collective effort and determination. The opening ceremony was grand, attended by Säduaqasov and other prominent figures as well as the local community."
alash.1295.a: "A worthy example for all young people!"

alash.1294.t: "Renaissance of Qazaq Theater"
alash.1294.d: "The Qazaq theater is now experiencing a significant renaissance, marked by the production of plays written by Qazaq playwrights. This period saw the continued development of a theatrical tradition that had been burgeoning since the early 20th century, exemplified by Muhtar Äuezov's landmark play \"Eńlik — Kebek\", which was first staged in Abay aul with Äuezov himself directing and prompting.\n\nSäduaqasov's support for such works ensured that theater, as a new social institution, not only entertained but also educated and inspired a sense of national identity among the people. The theatrical tradition, while seemingly new, drew upon the rich heritage of Qazaq oral culture, particularly the Aitys — a unique folk-oriented, oral tradition of improvised singing and oratory between two participants - aqyns.\n\nA notable milestone in this cultural renaissance is the staging of the opera \"Qyz-Jibek\" and the play \"Batyr Bayan\". \"Qyz-Jibek\", an opera based on a libretto by Gabit Musrepov, was staged at the Qazaq Musical Theater in [ALO_verniy_kazakh] by Jumat Shanin, a prominent director and playwright. The opera tells the tragic love story of Jibek and Tolegen, set against the patriarchal and feudal backdrop of their time. It incorporates Qazaq vocal and instrumental works, songs, and kuis by folk composers, blending traditional music with dramatic narrative.\n\nSimilarly, Mağjan Jumabaev's poem \"Batyr Bayan\" was brought to the stage, depicting the era of Khan Abylai and the valor of Qazaq batyrs, with a special focus on Kenesary Khan. These works, supported by Jas Azamat officially, reinforced a sense of national pride."

alash.1293.t: "Celebration of Nauryz Meiramy"
alash.1293.d: "Under the guidance of the Jas Azamat party, this year's Nauryz Meiramy became a significant cultural event. For the steppe dwellers, whether nomads or farmers, the vernal equinox has always been a special day, marking the end of winter and the beginning of a new cycle of life and growth. As the first rays of the bright sun pierced through the remnants of winter, Qazaqs across the steppe felt a renewed sense of energy and optimism. They would ride out into the vast plains, inhaling the moist, dense air scented with earth and fresh shoots, knowing that the earth was ready to bloom again and provide.\n\nThis sense of renewal and readiness for creative work was at the heart of the Nauryz celebration. For Qazaqs, Nauryz, meaning "new day" in Persian, has been a time-honored tradition, celebrated since ancient times, much like the Orthodox Maslenitsa.\n\nIn the western regions of Kazakhstan, such as [587.GetName] and [406.GetName], the holiday begins earlier on March 14, known locally as \"Amal\". This period is sacred for Qazaq nomads and is accompanied by the custom of people shaking hands to express respect and uphold the spiritual and moral values of the steppe. Younger individuals visit the homes of elders, greeting them and seeking their blessings for the new year. According to an ancient Qazaq legend, on the eve of Nauryz, Kydyr ata, a wise figure from Qazaq mythology, visits forty homes, fulfilling wishes and bringing good fortune and happiness. It is believed that if the household's thoughts are pure, Kydyr ata leaves a sign on a bowl filled with sugar and flour, signifying his blessing.\n\nThis year, Nauryz Meiramy, organized by Jas Azamat, featured traditional music, dance, food, and rituals."

This festival, meticulously organized by Smagul Säduaqasov in collaboration with the renowned Russian musician-ethnographist Aleksandr Zataevich, served as a celebration of traditional Qazaq music.\n\nSince settling in Orenburg in 1920, Zataevich dedicated himself to the collection, recording, and systematization of Qazaq folk music. His efforts culminated in the recording of over 2,300 pieces of musical folklore. His seminal works, \"1000 Songs of the Qazaq People\" and \"500 Qazaq Kuys and Songs\", published in 1931, provided an extensive anthology of Qazaq musical folklore spanning from ancient times to the 1930s. Last month, the third and final volume of this musical encyclopedia, featuring recordings from the southeastern and southern regions of [ROOT.GetName], was published, marking the completion of his exhaustive documentation of Qazaq music.\n\nThe \"Qazaq Ayenderi\" festival highlighted this rich heritage by providing a stage for composers and performers to showcase their talents."

These semi-autonomous military communities maintain a degree of independence, often operating outside the control of the central government.\n\nIn the ranks of parliament, opinions on how to treat Cossacks were sharply divided. The left wing of Alash and the radicals of Dulatuly, along with Amanzholov's nationalists, actively advocate a more aggressive approach. They propose to disband the Cossack troops and put them under strict government control. On the other hand, Minister-President and moderate Alash advocate a more diplomatic solution. They believe that confrontation with the Cossacks could lead to unnecessary conflict and destabilization in the region. Instead, they propose to negotiate with the Cossack leaders on granting them a truly autonomous status within the state."

Internal divisions and factionalism within the party had played a significant role in their electoral defeat. The once cohesive party had splintered into several factions, each with its own agenda and vision for the future. Key figures within the party, including Jahansha Dosmuhamedov of the left wing, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly of the radicals, and Älimhan Yermekov of the moderates, emphasized that the party's primary focus should be on the greater good of Alash Orda, rather than individual ambitions or ideological purity.\n\nWhile they have only began their journey to the reconciliation, significant milestone - recognizing the problem - has been already completed."

This reform stripped the Biy courts of their administrative functions, relegating them to a more ceremonial role under colonial rule. Despite these changes, Biy courts continued to operate in many communities, providing a familiar and respected means of resolving conflicts.\n\nThe Jas Azamat administration has declared its intent to modernize the nation's judicial system and announced the complete abolition of Biy courts, replacing them with a contemporary system of civil courts designed to align with modern legal standards and practices.\n\nSome factions within the government and the legal community advocate for codifying the Jeti Jarği, an ancient set of Qazaq laws. They propose developing new civil and penal codes based on these teachings, thereby preserving the essence of Qazaq legal system. The others, however, argue for the adoption of the Russian civil and penal codes, which have already been translated into the Qazaq language by Jahansha Dosmukhamedov and officially adopted in the country, albeit not widely implemented."

The new plan proposes the abolition of all existing regional divisions, effectively nullifying the traditional Vilayats. In their place, local Zemstvas will handle self-governance in their respective auls, villages, and towns. These Zemstvas, composed of elected representatives from the local populace, will take on responsibilities for various local administrative functions, from infrastructure maintenance to public services. This reform is seen as a crucial step in reducing the influence of regional power brokers and eliminating the remnants of the old feudal and colonial administrative structures.

A significant faction of parliamentarians is adamant that all illegally seized lands should be promptly returned to the Qazaqs, arguing that such restitution is essential for restoring rightful ownership. Conversely, the government proposes an equitable redistribution of the land, ensuring that not only the Qazaqs but also the settlers and Cossacks have fair access to land and water resources.\n\nShould the government choose to return the land to the Qazaqs, it will move swiftly to reclaim and return lands, potentially sparking significant unrest among settlers and Cossacks.

Consequently, Säduaqasov regarded class struggle, a fundamental tenet of Marxism, as an impediment to societal advancement rather than a catalyst for progress. This led him to support those forces that denied class struggle, particularly in the Qazaq steppe.\n\nSäduaqasov dedicated numerous articles in his newspaper \"Jas Azamat\" to the ideas of Robert Owen. The younger generation of Qazaqs, reading these articles, was inspired by Owen's utopian socialism and by Säduaqasov's vision of a Qazaqs country where social and economic reforms could be achieved peacefully and democratically. In its political platform, Jas Azamat consistently emphasized the importance of education and fair distribution of resources. This philosophy also influenced Säduaqasov's economic policies. He endorsed the growth of cooperatives and collective enterprises, which he perceived as a means of empowering workers and reducing economic inequality without resorting to expropriation or violence.\n\nCurrently, numerous concepts that had previously appeared to be utopian in this divided and desolate steppe are now becoming a reality.

The Union of Workers of the Uspensky Copper Mine, established on December 6, 1905, in [590.GetName] Oblast, is officially recognized as the first trade union organization in the country. This early movement also saw the creation of the first trade union cell on the railroad in 1905 at the steam locomotive depot of Perovsk station, now [1203.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. By July 1906, the district committee of the All-Russian Railway Union was established at [1212.GetName] station of the Orenburg-Tashkent railroad, and in 1932, workers and engineers organized their own district trade union organization with the commissioning of the Turkestan-Siberian railroad.\n\nDespite these early efforts, the proletariat in [ROOT.GetName] remained underdeveloped and relatively small in number. The Alash government, preoccupied with other pressing issues, did not prioritize the working class or the burgeoning trade union movement. However, this changed under the leadership of Jas Azamat.\n\nToday, the All-Qazaq Congress of Trade Unions was convened, a significant event aimed at unifying the various trade unions under a single structure. The Congress brought together representatives from different sectors, including mining, railroads, and manufacturing, to discuss the future of the labor movement in [ROOT.GetName].\n\nOne of the most important outcomes of the Congress was the establishment of a state association of Qazaq trade unions, symbolically named 'Birlik' (Unity).

The new government has declared, that according to the traditions, so honored by the previous government, the Mäslihat has power to depose a khan who failed to meet expectations or oppressed his subjects. This custom, called \"robbery of khan\" (Khan talau), ensured that the khan remained accountable to the people. If a khan resisted and caused harm, he was required to pay a ransom, but if his subjects suffered, no ransom was paid. This tradition underscored the collective responsibility of leadership and the ultimate authority of the people.\n\nUsing this tradition, the government has called for the new Mäslihat, that declared that the Khan has failed to meet expectations, and therefore he's no longer Khan from this minute."

alash.999.t: "Azat"
alash.999.d: "The government's recent policies have caused a big rift within the Alash Party. The left wing, which is closely linked to the Western Department of Alash Orda and led by the Dosmukhamedovs, has officially left the Alash Party. This move has led to the birth of a new political party, the Azat Party.\n\nThe Dosmukhamedovs, who are pretty influential in the Uralsk and Jympity area, have been unhappy with the government's direction for a while now. Their frustration has led to the creation of the Azat Party, which they've said will work closely with the Jas Azamat. Jas Azamat, another offshoot from the Alash Party, split in 1931 and has since been championing social-democratic ideals. While the Azat Party itself is still relatively small and primarily influential in its home regions its alignment with the more established Jas Azamat could potentially amplify its political impact."
alash.999.d2: "Today, the left wing of the Alash party, which is closely linked to the Western Department of Alash Orda and led by Jahansha Dosmuhamedov, has officially left the Alash Party. This move has led to the birth of a new political party, the Azat Party.\n\nThe Dosmukhamedovs, who are pretty influential in the Uralsk and Jympity area, have been unhappy with the party's direction for a while now.

alash.998.t: "People's Party"
alash.998.d: "There has been a significant rift within the Alash Party due to growing concern over its increasingly liberal policies. The nationalist wing of the party, spearheaded by Sadyq Amanjolov, has formally announced the creation of the People's Party.\n\nSadyq Amanjolov, a prominent figure and leader of the Alash Militia, along with his close associates, have expressed their discontent with the current direction of the Alash Party, arguing that it deviates too far from traditional values and nationalistic principles. This faction's dissatisfaction has culminated in the establishment of the People's Party, which aims to champion nationalist ideals more rigorously. The new party enjoys strong ties with the leadership of the Alash Militia, a key factor that could significantly influence the political dynamics within Alash Orda. The alignment of the National Party with the armed forces underscores the potential risk of losing the loyalty and support of the military, should the central government fail to address their concerns adequately."
alash.998.a: "They were long just an obstacle to liberal [ROOT.GetName]."

alash.997.t: "Dissolution of the Alash Party"
alash.997.d: "The Alash Party, once the dominant political force in Alash-Orda, has officially disbanded following the decision of the two most influential factions to split. This marks the end of an era.\n\nThe radical wing, led by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, and the moderate wing, led by Älimhan Yermekov, have decided to split due to irreconcilable differences in policy and vision for the future of the country. These two factions collectively constituted a significant majority within the Alash Party. As a result of their departure, the party structure was inevitably disintegrated.\n\nMirjaqyp Dulatuly's radical faction announced the formation of a new political entity, the Janar Party. This party will continue to advocate for progressive reform and modernization. In contrast, the moderate faction of Älimhan Yermekov established the Republican Party. This party is focused on pragmatic governance, stability, and gradual reforms.[alash_997_azat_status][alash_997_halyq_status]"

alash.996.t: "Executive Office Act"
alash.996.d: "Today, Minister-President Mirjaqyp Dulatuly initiated a number of reforms aimed at expanding the powers of his cabinet. Recognizing the need for strong and coordinated leadership, Dulatuly's measures aim to centralize the decision-making process and reduce bureaucratic inefficiency. His plan is to make the office of Minister-President electable by the general population. That would make the Halyq Kenesi feel almost useless, as it will lose its power to appoint the President.\n\nHowever, the Parliament did not like such measures. [GetAlashName], [GetNationalistName] and, of course, Üsh-Jüz have already expressed their disagreement with such a reform. Opposition parties and some regional leaders fear undermining democratic processes and local autonomy. Accusations of authoritarianism and centralization of power were made against the Dulatuly administration. These parties demand a balance - they are ready to vote for this bill, but fearing the usurpation of Dulatuly's power, they demand the empowerment of regional units."
alash.996.a: "Proceed with the current plan."
alash.996.b: "Agree to concessions."

alash.995.t: "Adoption of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Constitution"
alash.995.d: "Today, the government of [ROOT.GetName] officially adopted a new constitution after declaring independence from Russia. The Constitution begins with the assertion of the sovereignty of the Qazaq state, emphasizing its status as a state governed by its people. The national flag consists of horizontal stripes of green, red and yellow colors. The green color symbolizes the people's commitment to Islam, red - the blood shed in defense of the country, and yellow - the vast Qazaq steppes and the freedom they represent. In the upper corner of the flag, a crescent moon with a star reflects the nation's Islamic heritage.\n\nThe central place in the governance structure set out in the Constitution is occupied by Halyq Kenesi, the highest governing body elected by the people. This body is responsible for electing the President, who is elected for a four-year term with a two-term limit. The President administers through appointed ministers, who are subject to the approval of the Halyq Kenesi and must report on their work to both the President and the legislature. The Vice President acts as the Deputy President, ensuring continuity and support in management.\n\nThe Constitution establishes the separation of powers, in which the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government are clearly distinguished, providing a system of checks and balances. The judiciary acts independently, guided by the law and judicial rules, and judges are elected by Halyq Kenesi for life. The protection of human rights is the cornerstone of the Constitution, guaranteeing equality, freedom and the right to a happy life for all citizens, regardless of religion, ethnicity or gender.\n\nSpecific provisions relate to the unique aspects of Qazaq society. The Constitution provides that all people have equal rights and prohibits discrimination based on religion, blood, clan or race. The law guarantees freedom of speech, association and the creation of organizations, while prohibiting activities that incite tribal or national strife. Legal guarantees protect citizens from unlawful detention and guarantee the right to privacy.\n\nAs for land, the Constitution proclaims that Qazaq land is the collective property of the people, is not subject to sale, but is managed for the benefit of all. Natural resources, including minerals, forests, waters, lakes and mountains, are State property, and the use of land for grazing, farming and construction is regulated by the Government in the public interest.\n\nOur nation is embarking on a new path, the constitution is evidence of the Qazaq people's desire for a just, free and prosperous state."

The hall, adorned with the green, red, and yellow colors of the national flag, buzzed with anticipation as the proceedings commenced. Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, the charismatic leader of the Janar party, took to the stage to present the program charter. Dulatuly, known for his eloquence and passion, delivered a compelling speech that highlighted the core principles and key policies of the Janar. In his keynote speech, Dulatuly emphasized the need for a new political direction in Alash Orda, one that embraces progress and institutional modernization.\n\nThe culmination of the congress was the formal adoption of the Janar’s program charter. Delegates voted overwhelmingly in favor of the charter. In his closing remarks, Dulatuly thanked the delegates for their participation and dedication.

The congress began with a formal opening ceremony, featuring traditional Qazaq music and a ceremonial flag-raising. The party's banner, same as was used by the Alash party, was prominently displayed. Älimhan Yermekov took center stage to present the Republican Party's vision and policy platform. His speech was characterized by its clarity and conviction, emphasizing the party's commitment to republicanism, democracy, and national sovereignty. The highlight of the congress was the formal adoption of the Republican Party’s platform.

alash.992.t: "Dictatorship of [GetZhanarName]"
alash.992.d: "In a dramatic and unprecedented move, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, the Minister-President of Alash Orda and unrivaled leader of the [GetZhanarName] party, has orchestrated a self-coup, seizing power and transforming [ROOT.GetName] into a one-party state under his leadership. The coup began in the early hours of the morning, as loyalists within the military and key government institutions executed a meticulously planned operation to secure strategic locations throughout [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Communication hubs, government buildings, and major transportation routes were swiftly taken under control, ensuring minimal resistance and preventing any coordinated opposition. Dulatuly, flanked by senior military officials and [GetZhanarName] members, addressed the nation from the steps of the Parliament building. In his speech, he declared the ban of all political parties except for the [GetZhanarName]. He justified his actions by citing the need for strong and decisive leadership to guide [ROOT.GetName] through its ongoing modernization and development challenges.\n\nSupporters of Dulatuly and the [GetZhanarName] party welcomed the move, seeing it as a necessary step to accelerate the nation’s transformation and secure a prosperous future. Opposition Parties and Dissidents condemned the coup as a blatant power grab, an assault on democracy, and a betrayal of [ROOT.GetName]'s founding principles."
alash.992.a: "Last hope for our state."

alash.991.t: "Mirjaqyp Dulatuly Arrested!"
alash.991.d: "Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, the ambitious Minister-President of Alash Orda and leader of the [GetZhanarName], has been arrested following the failure of his attempted coup. The coup attempt began in the early hours of the morning, as Dulatuly’s loyalists within the military and key government institutions moved to secure strategic locations across [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. However, the plot was uncovered by elements within the Alash Militia and opposition factions, who swiftly mobilized to counter the threat. As Dulatuly took to the steps of the Halyq Kenesi building, opposition forces were already moving to thwart his plans. His speech was abruptly cut short as Alash Militia units, surrounded the building and detained the coup plotters. Following the arrest of Dulatuly and his key supporters, the situation in Orenburg and across Alash Orda remains tense. Dulatuly, along with several high-ranking members of the Janar Party and military officers involved in the coup, have been detained and are awaiting trial. The Alash Militia has imposed a temporary state of emergency to restore order and prevent any further attempts at destabilization.\n\nWhile some argue that instead of Dulatuly's coup, it was in fact the Alash Militia, that is now in control, still many hope that eventually Sadyq Amanjolov will restore democracy."
alash.991.a: "So, a coup and counter-coup in one day?"

alash.990.t: "The Last Fight of Qajymuqan"
alash.990.d: "It was a tense [GetMonth] morning in [590.GetName]: the [ROOT.GetAdjective] government had officially banned the Üsh-Jüz party. The rivalry with [ROOT.GetAdjective] and its representatives lasted for decades - so strong was the hatred between the two. And at the center of this storm was Qajymuqan Munaitpasuly, a prominent member of Üsh-Jüz and a legendary figure among his people.\n\nQajymuqan, a huge man with an imposing appearance, was known not only for his physical strength but also for his unwavering loyalty to the Qazaq people. A former wrestler, he earned respect and admiration not only throughout the steppe, but also throughout the world.\n\nThe government argues that Üsh-Jüz's activities threaten national unity and foment ethnic and religious discord, posing a significant risk to the stability of the newly formed Qazaq state.\n\nQajymuqan, however, viewed the ban as a declaration of war. When government forces began closing Üsh-Jüz regional offices and arresting key leaders of the movement, Qajymuqan stood firm. He called for protests, urging his followers to stand up for their rights, “to overturn Alash as I once overturned Nikolai Turbas.” The situation quickly escalated. Protests erupted in the strongholds of Üsh-Jüz, accompanied by clashes between demonstrators and the Militia. In the ensuing chaos, Qajymuqan was arrested.\n\nIn prison, Qajymuqan remained undeterred. His spirit and legacy continue to inspire those who believed in the idea of a unified Qazaq nation-state. However, one would like to believe that this was indeed Qajymuqan Munaitpasuly's last battle, and the last battle with Üsh-Jüz."

alash.989.d: "The two major political factions, [GetZhasAzamatName] and the ruling [ROOT.GetRulingParty], led by [ROOT.GetLeader], recognized the need for unity in the fledgling republic. This realization led to a series of high-level meetings aimed at forging stronger ties between the [GetZhasAzamatName] and Alash parties.\n\nToday, the leaders of both parties gathered in Halyq Kenesi, to discuss a coalition. Both parties agreed on the need for comprehensive economic reforms to modernize agriculture, develop industry, and improve infrastructure. Furthermore, both parties emphasized the importance of preserving Qazaq culture and heritage. With this agreements, the parties have agreed to form a coalition."
alash.989.a: "[GetZhasAzamatName] and [ROOT.GetRulingParty] will work together!"

alash.988.t: "The Apolitical Militia"
alash.988.d: "In an effort to strengthen the foundations of democracy in Alash Orda, the Government has initiated important debates to ensure the apolitical status of the Alash armed forces. The move was made in response to growing concerns about military involvement in politics and the need to respect the principle of civilian control over the armed forces. The discussion was provoked by the left-wing factions of the Alash party, who proposed to dismiss Sadyq Amanjolov, the head of the Alash militia and a prominent leader of the nationalist faction of the party. They argue that Amanjolov's departure is necessary to prevent any group from using the armed forces as a political tool. The left-wing factions proposed replacing Amanjolov with Bazarbay Mametuly, who is known for his close ties with the radical wing of the party. Although this proposal received the support of the left, it met with considerable resistance from both the nationalist faction and moderate members of the Alash party.\n\nNationalists, of course, were against the resignation of their influential leader, considering it as an attempt to weaken their influence. Moderates, on the other hand, expressed reasonable concern about the appointment of Mametuly, pointing out that his close ties with the radical wing would not solve the main problem of the politically influential military. Instead, it may simply shift bias from one faction to another.\n\nIn light of these concerns, an alternative solution was discussed to ensure the neutrality of the armed forces, such as the formation of a Military Council composed of senior military officers of various backgrounds and political views. This council will exercise collective oversight of the armed forces, which will make it difficult for any individual group to exert excessive influence."

alash.987.d: "Today, the Ministry of Modernization, headed by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, successfully carried out a coup d'etat, overthrowing Minister-President Älimhan Yermekov and seizing control of the government of [ROOT.GetName]. The seeds of this coup were sown shortly after Älimhan Yermekov assumed the post of Minister-President. Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, having initially persuaded the government to establish the Ministry of Modernization and subsequently assuming the role of its head, began clandestinely conspiring with a select group of loyal ministry employees. Over time, the influence of this group grew, effectively establishing a parallel shadow cabinet that operated in parallel with the official government.\n\nThe increased authority and broad reach of the Ministry of Modernization have allowed Dulatuly and his associates to advance a number of reforms that have strengthened their power and undermined the authority of the Minister-President. These reforms, although ostensibly aimed at further modernization, have also helped to strengthen Dulatuly's control over the most important aspects of the state mechanism.\n\nThe conspiracy has finally come to fruition. Seizing the moment and leveraging their influential supporters within the government and the military, Dulatuly and his faction swiftly and effectively executed a coup d'état. By the end of the day, Älimhan Yermekov was compelled to resign, and Dulatuly was publicly announced as the new head of government. For the general public, the change in government did not elicit any significant concerns.\n\nImmediately following the coup, Dulatuly swiftly implemented measures to consolidate his power. He appointed key supporters to key positions, thereby ensuring the continuation of the reforms of the Ministry of Modernization. In a public address, he called for unity and promised to adhere to the principles of progress and modernization, which have guided his policy so far."

At least that's what “Saryarqa” writes. The newspaper also transmits [ROOT.GetName]'s appeal: \"The Ministry of Modernization, which allegedly strives for progress, has become an instrument of political division. Its activities, which are largely influenced by Dulatuly's corrupt interests, undermined the smooth functioning of our government, and eventually led to a split in the party. The achievements and reforms attributed to the Ministry of Modernization are actually the result of joint initiatives and cooperation between various government departments. It was inefficient and unnecessary to maintain a separate ministry when its functions can and should be performed by other departments.\"\n\nThe article in the newspaper concludes with the words that the ministry's employees, many of whom were loyal to Dulatuly, were transferred to other ministries or dismissed."

As a result of the Russian judicial reform of 1864, the Biy courts largely lost their traditional importance as a legal institution, ceding administrative functions to colonial rule. Despite these changes, the Biy courts are still the basis for legal regulation and dispute resolution in Qazaq society.\n\nNow that Alash Orda needs to modernize and strengthen the legal system, it has to decide what to do with the Biy courts. One idea is to regulate their activities by the state, which would keep their traditional role but also subject them to supervision and control. Proponents say this respects Qazaqs cultural heritage and maintains continuity in the legal system. However, some people think that the government regulating the Biy courts could make them less independent and impartial, which would make them less effective at providing fair justice. Also, it would be hard to regulate these courts because they are decentralized and informal, which would create lots of logistical and administrative problems.\n\nAnother option is that Alash Orda might decide to completely get rid of the Biy courts and replace them with a modern system of civil courts. People who support this idea say that civil courts are more transparent and follow legal standards better. However, some people think that getting rid of the Biy courts completely could make some people feel left out. Also, setting up civil courts would take a lot of money and resources, which might be hard to find in a society that is still moving from a nomadic to a sedentary lifestyle."
alash.796.a: "Biy courts must remain."
alash.796.b: "Get rid of this survival of times past."

alash.795.t: "Regulation of Biy Courts"
alash.795.d: "While it was decided to keep the Biy courts, the government of Alash Orda has to come up with a way to regulate these traditional legal institutions. One idea is to create committees made up of legal experts, members of the public, and government officials. These committees will oversee the Biy courts and make sure that everything is done according to the law. They will also audit the Biy courts and judicial proceedings.\n\nAnother option is to codify the laws of Jeti Jarği, which will serve as a comprehensive legal basis for the trial of Biys. By formalizing the principles and procedures set out in the "Jeti Jarği", the government can standardize the judicial process and clarify the rights and obligations in legal disputes. Also, making the laws of Jeti Jarği official would make the decisions of the Biy courts more consistent and predictable, which would boost public confidence in the judicial system.\n\nAs a big step towards modernization, there's another option that would bring the Biy courts into the national judicial system of Alash Orda. By putting the Biy courts under the jurisdiction of higher courts and legal institutions, the government is trying to make sure that everything is done the same way and that everyone follows the national laws and regulations."
alash.795.a: "Establish judicial oversight committees"
alash.795.b: "Codify the Jeti Jarği"
alash.795.c: "Integrate the biy courts into national judiciary."

alash.794.t: "Codification of Jeti Jarği Laws"
alash.794.d: "The Alash Orda government started putting together a set of laws based on the teachings of Jeti Jarği. In addition to these, there is also the codification of the “Code of Qasim Khan” and Esim Khan's ordinance, as well as the provisions of the congresses of biys - “Yerezhe”, and “Biler sezi” - stories containing information on the practice of the biys' court - judicial precedents. Together, the laws cover a wide range of topics, from land disputes to family matters.\n\nAccording to the proposed plan, a team of lawyers and scholars will be assembled to carefully study and document the laws of Jeti Jarği, highlighting key principles and procedures that will form the basis of a unified legal code. Rayymjan Marsekuly, one of the first professional lawyers of the Alash Orda and Chairman of the Alash-Qala Zemstvo, will lead the team. They'll use historical texts, oral traditions, and scientific research to capture the essence of Jeti Jarği and adapt it to modern society."
alash.794.a: "Great!"

alash.793.t: "Civil Code for Alash Orda"
alash.793.d: "The government has announced plans to adopt a comprehensive civil code that will replace the traditional Biy and Sharia courts. The Ministry of Modernization is pushing for a switch to Western models of jurisprudence and is considering adopting the Swiss Civil Code as the basis for its new legal framework. Alternatively, Alash Orda could turn to its historical ties with Russia and adopt the Russian Civil Code as the basis for its new legal code. For those who want to keep the cultural heritage and legal traditions of Qazaqs, the codification of the laws of \"Jeti Jarği\" is a great alternative to Western or Russian legal models. By formalizing and modernizing traditional Qazaq laws, Alash Orda can create a unique legal code that reflects the values and norms of its society."
alash.793.a: "The Swiss civil code should be the base."
alash.793.b: "The Russian civil code will be more convenient for us."
alash.793.c: "Codify the Jeti Jarği"

alash.792.t: "Independent Muftiate for Alash Orda"
alash.792.d: "The idea of an independent Muftiate first emerged during the Second All-Qazaq Congress, where efforts to establish a separate religious institution for Qazaqs were thwarted by the influence of the Russian-controlled Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly. However, with the dawn of a new era of Alash sovereignty, the time has come to assert Qazaq control over religious matters and break free from external influence.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, the independent Muftiate for Alash Orda would serve as the supreme religious authority for the Qazaq people, responsible for overseeing religious practices, issuing religious rulings (fatwas), and administering religious institutions across the territory. The Mufti was also elected - Qabysh Berdalin, a famous Aqyn from Pavlodar region. He also headed the Pavlodar district branch of the Alash party. Led by a respected and knowledgeable Mufti, the Muftiate would uphold the principles of Islam.\n\nWhile the majority of ministers supported the establishment of the Muftiate, the leftist members, while endorsing this step towards independence, also criticized the decision for blurring the boundaries between church and state, calling for complete secularisation of the state."
alash.792.a: "Another colonial pillar is destroyed."

alash.791.t: "Office of Religious Affairs"
alash.791.d: "The Government has decided to establish the Office of Religious Affairs, a step against the growing concern about the influence of Qadimism and the need to promote secular values and tolerance in society. Although officially Alash Orda was formed as an autonomy within the Russian Republic and was secular according to Article 35 of the Constitution of the RDFR, the reality on the ground paints a more complex picture. Despite the constitutional provisions on secular governance, Islam continues to play a significant role in shaping social norms and traditions, and Sharia courts still operate in some regions. Moreover, the emergence of fundamentalist ideologies fueled by external influence from Turkestan poses a threat to the stability and progress of the Alash society.\n\nAccording to the proposed plan, the Office of Religious Affairs will serve as the central body responsible for overseeing all matters related to faith, worship and ethics in Alash Orda. The Office will actively promote secularism and tolerance in the Alash society, advocating the separation of religion from the state, while respecting the rights of individuals to freely profess their faith."
alash.791.a: "Another step towards modernization."

alash.790.t: "Reform of the Madrasas"
alash.790.d: "Jadidism, a reformist movement within the Islamic world, advocates for the modernization of education and the integration of Western scientific and technological advancements into traditional Islamic teachings. Originating in the late 19th century, Jadidism emerged as a response to the challenges posed by colonialism and the need to adapt Islamic education to the demands of the modern era. Under the government's plan, Jadid schools will receive increased support and resources to expand their reach and enhance the quality of education offered to students. Furthermore, the law will provide framework to spread New-Method teaching to all Madrasas of the country, potentially allowing to close any Qadimist madrasas.\n\nThe law is criticized by both the left and right - the left complain about lack of government funding for secular schools and public education for non-Muslims, while the right denigrate the government as apostates from the traditional Islamic faith."
alash.790.a: "Jadidism is the future of Islam."

alash.789.t: "Universal Public Education"
alash.789.d: "In a significant policy change aimed at modernizing the education system and promoting secular values, the Government of Alash Orda announced the creation of a comprehensive programme of universal public education and the establishment of a Ministry of National Education. Accessible and high-quality education for all citizens, regardless of their socio-economic status or cultural beliefs, is to be provided, while respecting secular norms and a Western approach to learning.\n\nUnder the new program, the Government will prioritize the development of a robust public education infrastructure that meets the diverse needs of the population and fosters a culture of intellectual growth, critical thinking, and social mobility. The Government will invest in expanding and improving public schools across the country, with a particular focus on increasing access to education in underserved areas and improving the quality of facilities, teaching staff and educational resources. A standardized curriculum based on secular principles and Western educational standards will be developed for implementation in all public schools. Comprehensive training programs will be organized for teachers to equip them with the pedagogical knowledge, teaching methods and subject matter expertise necessary to provide quality instruction in accordance with the new curriculum.\n\nWith regard to religious education, New-Method madrasas, both public and private, could be funded by religious entities through the Ministry of Education, while support for Qadimist and traditional madrasas would be suspended. Jadidism will be supported at the ministerial level, while maintaining the secularism of the state and actively sponsoring secularism.\n\nOf course, the measures have met resistance, largely from traditionalists and the right-wing in parliament, but these measures are necessary for the sake of modernization and development of the country."
alash.789.a: "We'll deal with illiteracy once and for all!"

alash.788.t: "Yermekov Challenges Dulatuly"
alash.788.t2: "Dulatuly Challenges Yermekov"
alash.788.d: "There is a sense of competition within the Alash party, with different factions vying to be recognized as the true successors to Älihan Bökeihan, the respected founder and guiding star of the movement.\nThe radical wing, led by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, is advocating for a more progressive approach, including secular rule, westernized education, and economic liberalization. Dulatuly and his supporters believe that the best way to honor Bökeihan's legacy is to address the challenges facing Qazaq society, including the need to modernize and diversify the economy. They also believe that it is important to resist Russia's influence on the country. Dulatuly's charismatic leadership and passionate advocacy of progressive ideals have attracted a significant number of supporters to the party, especially among urban intellectuals and young professionals.\n\nBy contrast, the moderate wing, led by Älimhan Yermekov, places a strong emphasis on continuity, stability, and gradual progress. Yermekov is often seen as a voice of reason and moderation, and he has been known to prioritize gradual reforms, institutional sustainability, and consensus-building in policymaking. With his experience in the party establishment and his reputation as a diplomat, Yermekov enjoys the support of various segments of the population, urban and rural communities, and those who are interested in maintaining the status quo and moving forward with caution on the path of modernization.\n\nAs the struggle for power continues, both wings of the Alash party are trying to strengthen their positions and secure leadership."
alash.788.a: "Interesing."

alash.787.t: "Yermekov Ousted From Office"
alash.787.d: "After a protracted struggle for power in the Alash party, the Radical wing wins, strengthening its influence and actually displacing the moderate wing. Minister-President Yermekov was forced to resign from his post after supporters of Dulatuly threatened to raise the issue of confidence in the government in the Halyq Keńesi. On the extraordinary congress the next week, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly was appointed as the acting Minister-President, until new elections to the parliament.\n\nNot only the government, but the party leadership positions were also restructed, with the remnants of 'Yermekov's political clique' forced to leave the party or publicly condemn Yermekov."
alash.787.a: "Alash grow more united, don't they?"

alash.786.t: "Dulatuly Ousted From Office"
alash.786.d: "After a protracted struggle for power in the Alash party, the Moderate wing wins, strengthening its influence and actually displacing the radicals. Minister-President Dulatuly was forced to resign from his post after supporters of Yermekov threatened to raise the issue of confidence in the government in the Halyq Keńesi.

alash.785.t: "Moderate Wing Dissolves"
alash.785.d: "After a protracted struggle for power in the Alash party, it is now became clear that the Moderate wing has lost this war. Today, Älimhan Yermekov, the leader of the Moderate wing, has announced that he is retiring from politics in order to devote his time and energy to be a professor of Mathematics at the [ALO_verniy_kazakh] Mining and Metallurgical Institute.\n\nWith him gone, his 'political clique' has also dissolved with the majority of its members supporting Mirjaqyp Dulatuly."

alash.784.t: "Radical Wing Dissolves"
alash.784.d: "After a protracted struggle for power in the Alash party, it is now became clear that the Liberate wing has lost this war. Today, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, the leader of the Moderate wing, has announced that he is retiring from politics in order to return to publishing and teaching activities.\n\nWith him gone, his 'political clique' has also dissolved with the majority of its members either supporting Älimhan Yermekov or Jahansha Dosmukhamedov."

alash.783.t: "Reform of the Alphabet"
alash.783.d: "The Qazaq alphabet is based on Arabic script, called 'Jana emle', - created by Baytursynuly in 1912 and officially adopted in 1924. This alphabet was an adaptation of the Arabic script to the phonological features of the Qazaq language. At the initiative of the Ministry of Modernization, a bold proposal was put forward to switch to the Latin alphabet. Proponents of this reform emphasize the benefits of interconnectedness and cultural conformity to the broader Turkic language sphere, envisaging closer ties with the Ottomans and other Turkic-speaking peoples. However, there are dissenters in the government who strongly oppose this proposal. Supporters of the preservation of "Jana emle" insist on the need to preserve the linguistic heritage and phonetic accuracy.\n\nConversely, Cyrillic supporters, driven by Russophile sentiments, advocate the restoration of historical ties with Russia. They consider the Cyrillic alphabet not just as an alphabet, but also as a means of transmitting the cultural and political heritage of the Russian Empire."
alash.783.a: "Jana emle shall stay for years to come."
alash.783.b: "Adopt the Latin - we must modernize, not be colonized."
alash.783.c: "Adopt the Cyrillic - for better mutual understanding with the Russians."

alash.782.t: "Land Tenure Reform"
alash.782.d: "Since its inception, the Alash government has grappled with the land ownership in the region. Qazaq leaders have long advocated for the restitution of lands seized from them during the Russian colonial period, particularly in northern arable lands, where Russian settlers have become the majority. A critical decision on land reform looms large.\nThe Ministry of Modernization, supported by the [GetAzatName], [GetZhasAzamatName] and even such political outsiders, as Üsh-Jüz and [GetNationalistName] on this matter, wants to proceed with the immediate redistribution of land, prioritizing the return of confiscated territories to Qazaq communities. This move is likely to strengthen the government's legitimacy among disenfranchised Qazaq populations and fulfill a long-standing promise of the Alash party. However, while this decision may appease Qazaq nationalists and bolster internal stability, it would most likely provoke a backlash from Russian settlers, Cossacks, and the Russian state, serving as a great threat to our diplomatic relations and internal stability. Furthermore, rapid land redistribution may disrupt agricultural production and investment, leading to a short-term economic instability.\n\nOn the other hand, a quite unpopular decision lies - maintaing the existing land tenure system, allowing Russian settlers to retain ownership of their lands in Alash Orda. Making this choice will avoid potential conflicts and ethnic tensions, but will unconditionally lead to a political crisis."
alash.782.a: "Enact immediate land redistribution."
alash.782.b: "Maintain Status Quo."

alash.781.t: "Quiet Before the Storm"
alash.781.d: "Following the government's decision to proceed with immediate land redistribution in Alash Orda, Russian settlers grapple with the implications of losing their land and livelihoods. The response varies widely among the settler communities: in some regions the process of land redistribution unfolds relatively peacefully. Settlers who occupy small plots of land and lack significant resources willingly surrender their holdings to indigenous Qazaq families, and either seek refuge in [RUS.GetName] or move to the cities to earn their fortune. However, there was also blood. As local conflicts erupted between Qazaqs and Settlers, both sides suffered casualties. In Semirechye, the situation deteriorated even further. The region, already known for its volatile mix of ethnic tensions, saw large-scale revolts among the settler population. Armed clashes broke out, leading to significant destruction. Settler militias, bolstered by support from sympathetic Cossack groups, fortified their positions and prepared for prolonged resistance against the government's decrees.\n\nAdditionally, in urban centers, the Russian majority mobilizes in protests to contest the government's land redistribution policies. Settlers seek injunctions and court rulings to halt the implementation of land reforms, arguing that they violate property rights and undermine the rule of law."
alash.781.a: "The situation becomes serious."

alash.780.t: "Selective Enforcement"
alash.780.d: "According to previous negotiations with the Cossack Hosts, their lands were recognized as the property of the Cossacks, therefore the government should not involve into economic matters of the Hosts. However, as local Qazaq populations pledge to return their lands, some of our nationalist-minded ministers suggest that we should deprive the Cossacks of their arable lands as well, resettling it with the Qazaq owner.\n\nThis would, no doubt, signify a 'declaration of war' by the Cossack Atamans."
alash.780.a: "There can be no step back - the land is ours."
alash.780.b: "We need Cossacks out of this."

alash.7800.d: "According to previous negotiations with the Cossack Hosts, their lands were recognized as the property of the Cossacks, therefore the government should not involve into economic matters of the Hosts.

alash.779.d: "As expected, the Cossack Atamans were outrageous, when they received information about Cossack lands being requisitioned in favor of Qazaqs, seeing them as a clear threat to their way of life.

At the other end of the wire, they demanded an immediate halt to the unconstitutional land reform. Otherwise, [FROM.Capital.GetName] is threatening to reintroduce troops into the territory of the Autonomy - a privilege they say we \"brazenly took advantage of\" when the metropolis was weak.\n\nAnd it seems like it's now or never.

That is the sound of obedience.\n\nThe Great War did not reach the distant steppe, and only the horrors of the 1916 uprising and civil war were still fresh in the memory of many Qazaqs. The uprising failed, bringing only pain and exile. The civil war did not bring the long-awaited freedom. And now again - under the rumble of an armored killing machine - Qazaqs are forced to bend the knee.\n\nNumerous gawkers and citizens who were not lucky enough to be in the proud city of Semey on that ill-fated day, when ministers were led out of the government building in handcuffs by an armed convoy for treason."

The reform, which aims to redistribute land to Qazaq communities, has encountered significant resistance from the Cossack hosts, who view these measures as a direct threat to their autonomy. The new law mandates the reassignment of large tracts of fertile land currently owned by Cossack settlers to local Qazaqs. In wealth and established Cossack stanitsas, fierce resistance has emerged, leading to clashes. The government now stands at a critical point - whether to leave the Cossacks alone, freezing the conflict, or deal with them once and for all."

alash.761.t: "Law on Surnames and National Identity"
alash.761.d: "In a move to modernize and unify the national identity, the Ministry of Modernization has proposed a sweeping reform regarding the naming conventions of its citizens. Historically, Qazaqs used only personal names, often supplemented by titles or descriptors that reflected their social status or notable characteristics. For example, Bogenbai was known as Bogenbai batyr due to his status as a warrior, and Bukar was known as Bukar zhyrau because of his renown as a poet. This traditional system, however, is now seen as a vestige of tribalism and an obstacle to creating a cohesive national identity.\n\nThe proposed law aims to abolish the use of ancestral names and introduce formal surnames for all citizens. This change is partly inspired by the practice during the Tsarist era and later, under the Russian Federative Republic, where Qazaqs were assigned Russian-style surnames with endings like -ov, -ev, or -in, derived from the name of their father or grandfather. The Ministry suggests to replace these Russian surnames with distinctly Qazaq ones.\n\nThe reform has sparked a heated debate within the parliament and among the public. Nationalists that the most authentic way to honor Qazaq heritage is to officially recognize ancestral names as surnames."
alash.761.a: "Adopt new Qazaq surnames."
alash.761.b: "Adopt ancestral names as surnames."
alash.761.c: "No need to change that."

alash.760.t: "Addressing the Nomadism Issue"
alash.760.d: "One of the most pressing challenges in Alash Orda is tribalism and nomadism. The central question facing the party is how to balance the traditional nomadic lifestyle, which has defined Qazaq identity for centuries, with the demands of modern statehood and economic development. The left-wing members suggest that first and foremost demand is to redistribute the land. Fertile lands for agriculture and pasture will encourage Qazaqs to settle down on these lands. Furthermore, they believe in a need to promote cooperative farming, which would help them transition smoothly and maintain community bonds. The main part of their plan is a comprehensive support program for the nomadic population - providing free or subsidized housing, education and healthcare.\n\nThe party moderates believe that the issue should be addressed gradually. They have proposed phased programs, that offer housing and employment opportunities over several years.\n\nFinally, the Nationalists have outright denounced any plans on changing the traditional way of life. They see to preserve nomadic way of life, while integrating modern infrastructure and services."
alash.760.a: "Support initiative of the Left."
alash.760.b: "Gradual transition is the best."

alash.759.d: "Today, the Ministry of Modernization declared a historic victory in its comprehensive sedentarization program, marking the successful transition of the Qazaq people from a predominantly nomadic lifestyle to settled agricultural and urban communities. Under the visionary leadership of Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, the Ministry of Modernization was established to oversee and implement wide-ranging reforms designed to uplift and modernize the Qazaq society. The sedentarization program was a key component of these reforms.\n\nThe success of the program is evident in the statistics released by the Ministry of Modernization. Over 80% of the previously nomadic population has now settled in permanent homes, with significant improvements in living standards, access to education, and healthcare. Agricultural productivity has increased, contributing to food security and economic stability."
alash.759.a: "Great victory!"

alash.758.t: "Tribes Resist Sedentarization"
alash.758.d: "Despite the comprehensive sedentarization program, significant resistance has emerged from some nomadic tribes who view the forced settlement as an attack on their traditional way of life. Several tribes have banded together to resist the government's efforts, leading to violent clashes with Alash Militia forces.\n\nReports indicate that the nomadic uprisings have disrupted transportation routes, destroyed infrastructure projects, and resulted in casualties on both sides."
alash.758.d2: "Despite the comprehensive sedentarization program, significant resistance has emerged from some nomadic tribes who view the forced settlement as an attack on their traditional way of life. In the steppes of [590.GetName], several tribes have banded together to resist the government's efforts.\n\nReports indicate that the nomadic uprisings have disrupted transportation routes and destroyed infrastructure projects, furthermore - the Alash Militia, headed by a known supporter for nomadism, Sadyq Amanjolov, did nothing."
alash.758.a: "That's bad."

alash.757.t: "Resource Shortages in New Settlements"
alash.757.d: "As the sedentarization program progresses, the rapid influx of nomadic populations into newly established settlements has led to severe resource shortages. The infrastructure, still in its nascent stages, is struggling to provide adequate food, water, and shelter for the growing number of settlers.\n\nReports of famine have emerged from several settlements, with food supplies dwindling and agricultural production failing to meet the needs of the population.\n\nThe government's response has been to divert resources from other regions, but this has led to discontent and unrest in those areas as well."
alash.757.a: "Alarming."

alash.756.t: "Corruption Scandal Disrupts Sedentarization"
alash.756.d: "A major corruption scandal revealed widespread embezzlement and mismanagement of funds intended for the sedentarization program. Investigation has uncovered that local administrators have been siphoning off resources meant for building infrastructure and supporting settlers. This scandal has not only delayed the construction of vital facilities but has also eroded public trust in the government's ability to manage the program effectively."
alash.756.a: "We must prevent this in the future."

alash.755.t: "Jetisu Council of the Alash Party"
alash.755.d: "The main stronghold of the nationalist faction within the Alash party was the Jetisu Alash Council and its leaders - Ybyrayym Jaynaqov, Isa Tergeusizov, Jaqyp Akpayev, and, of course, Sadyq Amanjolov. Their views were significantly influenced by the nature of the Russian Civil War. Jaynaqov and Amanjolov personally witnessed the carnage unleashed by the Bolsheviks in [589.GetName] - in fact one of the few regions of Turkestan where the Bolsheviks had a strong position. The terror and chaos brought by the Bolsheviks made the Jetisu Qazaqs forever opponents of the Russian Communists and anyone they suspected of ties with them. When [589.GetName] was liberated from Bolshevism, new executioners came instead - the Annenkovites, bloodthirsty Cossacks and bandits who liberated the region. Jaqyp Akpayev was arrested by the Kolchakites and sentenced to execution, which also had a significant impact on the views of the Jetisu Alash members.\n\nNow they finally had in their hands a country that for many years had remained an appendage of Russia, a part of the former empire that the empire did not want to let go."
alash.755.a: "The Steppe will be free as it once was"

alash.754.t: "Military Coup in [ROOT.GetName]"
alash.754.d: "Today, the head of the Alash Militia and leader of the [GetNationalistName], Sadyq Amanjolov has initiated a military coup against the government. The coup begain in the early hours of the morning, as units of the Alash Militia loyal to Amanjolov seized key government buildings, communication centers and military bases in the capital city. The plotters secured radio and telegraph stations, took control of the government headquarters and Halyq Kenesi. By dawn, [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] was effectively under military control, and government officials were either detained or placed under house arrest.\n\nAmanjolov addressed the nation through a broadcast from the occupied radio station, condemning recent government's decisions. He declared the establishment of a provisional military government to oversee a return to the original goals of the Alash movement."
alash.754.a: "When the government cannot, the military can!"

alash.753.t: "Approving the List of Candidates"
alash.753.d: "In a historic moment for the Qazaq nation, the election of a new Khan is underway. Traditionally, the Qazaq Khan must be a member of the Töre dynasty, the descendants of Genghis Khan, who have always held the exclusive right to be elected to this esteemed position.\n\nTwo prominent candidates have emerged as the frontrunners in this election. Äzimhan Kenesarin is a direct descendant of Kenesary Khan, the last Qazaq Khan, known for leading the national liberation movement of the Qazaqs from 1837 to 1847 in their struggle for independence from the Russian Empire. Äzimhan has a strong legacy of resistance and patriotism. In 1905, he played a significant role in drafting the Qarqaraly petition to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire, advocating for Qazaq rights and autonomy. His commitment to the Qazaq cause was further demonstrated in 1917, when he organized a congress of Qazaqs of the Aulie-Ata district and served as the deputy chairman at the Second All-Qazaq Congress. Since 1921, he has been the secretary of the Syrdariya council of the Alash party, demonstrating his leadership and dedication to the Qazaq nation. Äzimhan Kenesarin is widely regarded as the leading candidate for the Khan's throne, with strong support for his experienced and nationalist credentials.\n\nThe second choice is Gabdol-Hakim Bökeihan, a great-grandson of Bökei Khan, represents a different lineage of leadership. Bökei Khan, after a failed claim to the throne of the Junior jüz, created the semi-independent Bukey Horde with the permission of Emperor Paul I of All Russia in 1801. The Bukey Horde, which existed from 1812 to 1845, was an attempt to preserve some degree of autonomy under Russian suzerainty. Gabdol-Hakim graduated from the Ural Troops Real School and later studied at the Moscow Agricultural Academy. He is known for his left-wing views and is considered less preferable by traditionalists. His affiliation with the Üsh-Jüz party also raises concerns."
alash.753.d2: "$alash.753.d$\n\nThere is also something - Sherali Lapin, the influential leader of Turkestan's Ittifoqi Muslimin, has put forward a proposal, that deviates from the traditional Töre dynasty lineage, instead advocating for the selection of a Khan from the Ottoman princes: Mehmed Abdülkerim, Mehmed Orhan, or Mahmud Namik. This proposal aims to strengthen ties with the Ottoman Empire, potentially offering political and economic benefits."
alash.753.a: "Äzimhan, with no doubts, should become the Khan."
alash.753.b: "Gabdol-Hakim, despite all odds, is elected."
alash.753.c: "Mehmed Abdülkerim is chosen instead."
alash.753.e: "Ottoman Prince Mehmed Orhan is elected."
alash.753.f: "Mahmud Namik is guaranteed the throne."

alash.752.t: "Khan Silau - Mäslihat of [GetYear]"
alash.752.d: "The excitement and anticipation were palpable as news of the forthcoming election of the khan (khan silau) spread across the land. Jasauyls, the traditional heralds, announced the event to all the clans, ensuring that everyone was aware of this significant occasion. As the day approached, preparations were made with great enthusiasm. Women and children donned their finest clothes, while the men arrived at the Mäslihat in full armor, signifying their right to vote and their readiness to participate in this momentous event.\n\nThe ceremony, as in old times, began with a solemn prayer by the Hoja, invoking blessings and guidance for the proceedings. Following this, the respected Aqsaqal, a venerable elder, took the floor to address the gathered clans. Two prominent candidates stood before the people - Äzimhan Kenesarin, the grandson of Kenesary Khan, spoke first. He highlighted his own contributions, including his role in the Qarqaraly petition and his service in the Alash party. Next, Gabdol-Hakim Bökeihan, the great-grandson of Bökei Khan, addressed the assembly. As each candidate and their supporters made their speeches, the assembly listened intently.\n\nWith the people's decision made in favour of [alash_752_d_winner], the ritual of \"raising the khan\" (Khan Kөteru) was scheduled for the following Friday. On that day, a white koshma will be laid on top of a hill, symbolizing purity and a fresh start. The newly elected khan will be seated on the koshma facing Mecca. Four of the most respected sultans, biys, bays, and batyrs will then lift the khan three times above their heads, officially declaring him as the new ruler."

alash.752.a: "Long live the Khan!"

alash.751.t: "Ulus-Aymaqs"
alash.751.d: "Historically, the Qazaq system of state administration was deeply rooted in customary law (adat) and Islamic law. In the XV-XVII centuries, the primary unit of administrative and political organization were uluses. Each ulus had a distinct territory known as \"Yurt\", and within these uluses, the local governance was carried out by various levels of leaders, from aulbasy to sultans. The smallest administrative unit, the aul, consisted of relatives and members of the same clan. Each aul was led by an aulbasy, responsible for organizing migrations, resolving disputes, strengthening the economy, and ensuring timely tax payments. A collection of auls formed an ata-aymaq, which was led by an aqsaqal (elder). The aqsaqal was a respected figure whose orders were always followed by the community. Several ata-aymaqs made up a clan, led by a clan rubasy, an experienced and respected individual who defended the interests of the clan within the broader aymaq. Large administrative units were led by sultans, who had significant powers and were responsible for executing the Khan's will.\n\nThe government, aiming to break away from the remnants of Russian colonial administration and restore traditional Qazaq governance structures, decided to replace the existing vilayats (which were based on Russian oblasts) with aymaqs and ata-aymaqs. The reform is seen as a critical step towards decolonization and the revival of traditional Qazaq governance, aimed to strengthen local communities and align administrative structure with the clannish system."
alash.751.a: "This will bring much peace to our nation."

alash.750.t: "Conspiracy Thoughts"
alash.750.d: "Let's be honest - our country is divided between those who want it free and prosperous and socialists of all stripes. Whether it is the Üsh-Jüz party, which criticized Alash from the very rise of the national movement, collaborated with the Bolsheviks and betrayed the ideals of the Qazaq state, or the leftist members of Alash who bent to the Russian colonizer and the Cossack.\n\nNow that the confident Batyr, a fighter for the freedom of the Qazaq nation, is in power, the time has come to tame these traitors. If we do not make efforts to fight against this leftist beast in time, they will tear our throats and take over the country."
alash.750.a: "No mercy for the enemies of the Qazaqs!"

alash.749.t: "The Coup"
alash.749.d: "There was a coup in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today. The inhabitants of the vast steppe will still learn about it from tomorrow's newspapers, but witnesses of the events are already aware of it - Sadyq Amanjolov, the batyr and defender of the nation, was arrested and sent to prison for abuse of power. The coup led by the famous jigit Bazarbay Mametuly served only as a reminder that not all power is unlimited. And although Mametuly himself in this case exceeded his authority, he should be given credit - in his speech he announced the establishment of a provisional government for the period of stabilization and until the extraordinary elections.\n\nDespite the growing repression against socialists in Amanjolov's time, they were not the main true opponents of the general, but former colleagues in the Alash party - Mametuly himself, together with Amanjolov, was at the origin of the Alash movement in Jetisu. But being more progressive, he had long ago \"defected\" to Mirjaqyp Dulatuly.\n\nIt was Dulatuly who eventually turned out to be the main beneficiary of the coup. [alash_794_d_arrest]Dulatuly has already announced the resumption of his faction's activities and is probably one of the favorites in the upcoming elections."
alash.749.a: "Danger comes from unexpected places."

alash.748.t: "Sherali Lapin Seeks Shelter"
alash.748.d: "The prominent leader of the Turkestan's Ittifoqi Muslimin Qadimist party, an ethnic Qazaq, Sherali Lapin has recently entered our country from [TRK.Capital.GetName], after being released from prison. The new government of Turkestan, while having released him, bans any 'fundamentalist' movements and Lapin was forced to flee the country."
alash.748.d2: "The prominent leader of the Turkestan's Ittifoqi Muslimin Qadimist party, an ethnic Qazaq, Sherali Lapin has recently entered our country from [TRK.Capital.GetName], after fleeing his homeland."
alash.748.a: "We welcome all refugees from the extremist Turkestan!"

alash.747.t: "A Position For Lapin?"
alash.747.d: "We have allowed Sherali Lapin to stay in our country, but his influence as the leader of Turkestan's only Qadimist party is much more, than being a regular person. The government, after some debate, has decided to offer this man a position of a minister in no charge. Our own Qadimists, however, argue that Lapin's role should be even more influential - the minister of internal affairs."
alash.747.a: "That's all we can do for him."
alash.747.b: "We can do more - Lapin deserves to be in charge of internal affairs."

alash.746.t: "[FROM.GetName] Suggests Alliance"
alash.746.d: "The friendly government of [FROM.GetName] has suggested alliance with our country and party in order to unite all true muslims."
alash.746.a: "Accept their offer!"
alash.746.b: "Reject."

alash.745.t: "[FROM.GetName] Rejects!"
alash.745.d: "Surprisingly, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government does not view us as equal partners and refused an alliance."
alash.745.a: "Their loss."

alash.744.t: "Ittifoqi Muslimin in [ROOT.GetName]?"
alash.744.d: "Along with Sherali Lapin's rapidly growing influence, he suggested that we join forces in our struggle - and unite our parties. Ittifoqi Muslimin has long cooperated with our organization at various levels, and even had branches in Turkestan, but now that our coalition is formalized, Lapin proposes to join forces. He is willing to give up leadership over the entire party, while retaining leadership over the Turkestan branch."
alash.744.a: "That's an excellent idea."
alash.744.b: "We think it's unnecessary."

alash.743.t: "Ties With Ittifoqi Muslimin"
alash.743.d: "The Turkestan's Ittifoqi Muslimin party is the most influential Qadimist party in all of Central Asia. Our wing of the party has established ties with Sherali Lapin's organization long ago, but these ties were informal, as we were still part of the Alash party. Now, we are open to establish ties with them and ensure that our parties cooperate on many levels."
alash.743.a: "We are the last hope for Turkestan and the Steppe."

alash.742.t: "Policies on Segregation"
alash.742.d: "The government of [ROOT.GetName] has announced two new decrees aimed at strengthening Qazaq cultural identity and reducing Russian influence within the nation. These decrees form a part of the government's broader policy of segregation. Effective immediately, the teaching of the Russian language in all educational institutions, from primary schools to universities, is prohibited. This move is aimed at promoting the Qazaq language and ensuring that the younger generation is more deeply connected to their cultural roots. All Russian language classes and materials are to be removed from curriculums, while he government will provide additional resources for Qazaq language education, including new textbooks and teacher training programs. But that was not enough.\n\nThe government has also decreed that new citizens of Russian origin will be prohibited from settling in urban areas. This measure is intended to prevent the demographic and cultural dilution of [ROOT.GetAdjective] cities and prevent formation of the Russian proletariat."
alash.742.a: "Finally the Russians will learn to respect us."

alash.741.t: "Traditional Values in Qazaq Nomadic Society"
alash.741.d: "The nomadic lifestyle of the Qazaqs has profoundly shaped their spiritual world, worldview, customs, and traditions. The harsh living conditions of the extreme Steppe climate, changing pastures, scarce water sources, threats of enemy attacks, and the necessity of caring for livestock — greatly influenced their way of life. For Qazaqs, cattle were of immense value, a sentiment echoed in proverbs like \"Mal ashuy — jean ashuy\" (\"Pain for cattle is the pain of the soul\") and \"Birinshi baylyk — densaulyk, ekinshi baylyk – ak zhaulyk, ushinshi baylyk — bes saulyk\" ("The first wealth is health, the second wealth is family, the third wealth is the presence of cattle").\n\nThe nomadic lifestyle also shaped the upbringing of children. The patriarchal Qazaq family formed social foundations and traditional values centered on a moral attitude toward nature and the world, respect for the mother as the keeper of the hearth, reverence for the father as the head of the family, and honoring the spirits of ancestors. The ban on marriage within the seventh generation, despite the spread of Sharia law allowing closer relationships, remained sacred. The practical upbringing in a nomadic lifestyle emphasized early work, independence, physical endurance, attentiveness to nature, and knowledge of crafts and traditions. Youths were prepared to become valuable members of their extended family groups. The wise educational practices of Qazaq ancestors ensured the survival and cultural continuity of the Qazaqs as an ethnic group, preserving many traditions and customs to this day."
alash.741.a: "Tradition is the only value that can be adopted but not taken away."

alash.740.t: "Jas Azamat Joins [GetAzatName]"
alash.740.d: "With our recent policies directed against the socialist parties, the Jas Azamat leadership has grown increasingly paranoid about our government's intentions. The party has split on the question of its future, and has decided that it would be better for them to align the [GetAzatName] and officially join them, while dissolving their own party. Knowing that our government will unlikely persecute those, who helped to build the Alash Orda, the decision of the Jas Azamat was rather wise."
alash.740.a: "That's clever!"

# Üsh-Jüz Events #
alash.739.t: "Müqan Äitpenov Elected"
alash.739.d: "In a sudden turn of events, Müqan Äitpenov, the founding leader of the Üsh-Jüz party, has been elected as the Minister-President of [ROOT.GetName]. This marks the first time that Üsh-Jüz has taken the helm of the government and comes with significant challenges for our government.\n\nFirstly, the ascension of Üsh-Jüz to power brings a cadre of new and relatively inexperienced officials into key positions of the government. Many of these officials lack practical experience in statecraft and administration. Secondly, the military and general staff, predominantly loyal to the Alash party, pose a formidable obstacle. The resistance within the ranks of the armed forces threatens to undermine the stability of the new administration. And finally, Despite their electoral defeat, the Alash party retains substantial influence across various sectors of society, including the media, academia, and local governments. This entrenched power base allows them to effectively challenge and obstruct our initiatives."
alash.739.a: "Qazaqs must throw off the shackles of the corrupt Alash regime!"

alash.738.t: "Alash Party Seeks Unity Post-Election Defeat"
alash.738.d: "The surprising victory of the Üsh-Jüz party in the recent elections was a stark wake-up call for the Alash Party, which had long held a dominant position. Internal divisions and factionalism within the party had played a significant role in their electoral defeat. The once cohesive party had splintered into several factions, each with its own agenda and vision for the future. Key figures within the party, including Jahansha Dosmuhamedov of the left wing, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly of the radicals, and Älimhan Yermekov of the moderates, emphasized that the party's primary focus should be on the greater good of Alash Orda, rather than individual ambitions or ideological purity.\n\nWhile they have only began their journey to the reconciliation, significant milestone - recognizing the problem - has been already completed."
alash.738.a: "We can't let them get any stronger!"

alash.737.t: "A Brewing Storm"
alash.737.d: "The recent election of Müqan Äitpenov as Minister-President has ushered in a new era for [ROOT.GetName] under the red banners of the Üsh-Jüz. Throughout his political career, Müqan Äitpenov has consistently positioned himself as a moderate leader, however, this moderate stance stands in stark contrast to the more radical elements within his party. The late Qölbay Tögusov, a fervent proponent of radical change, left a legacy of uncompromising revolutionary ideals that continue to resonate with a significant faction of Üsh-Jüz members. Since the resurgence of the Üsh-Jüz party and their subsequent electoral victory, radicalism has gained momentum among the party's ranks and the broader population. This revolutionary fervor, fueled by years of dissatisfaction and a desire for swift and sweeping changes, has led to increasing calls for drastic measures.\n\nMüqan Äitpenov now faces the daunting task of balancing the moderate path he envisions with the growing demands for radical action. Failure to address and contain this radical sentiment could lead to severe consequences."

alash.736.d: "With the onset of the 1916 revolt, Äbdiğapar Janbosynūly was proclaimed Khan of the Qypşaq Qazaqs. A member of the Qypşaq clan and a descendant of the notable Qazaq bai Niyaz Tileuiūly, Janbosynūly received a solid Islamic education and devoted much of his early life to farming, irrigation, and education, even establishing a school in his aul. He commanded the eastern half of the rebellion, while Ospan Şolaqūly led the western half under the Argyn clan. Despite his nominal political leadership, Janbosynūly delegated most authority to an elected council of twenty representatives, a system that came to be known as 'Steppe Democracy'. His focus remained primarily on military affairs. On 22 October 1916, Janbosynūly's forces besieged Torğai. However, the siege was abandoned in favor of direct confrontation with Russian troops. Following this, his troops strategically retreated to Batbakkara, engaging in guerrilla warfare. During this period, Şolaqūly's forces suffered a defeat at the hands of the Russians, while Janbosynūly continued to resist until the February Revolution prompted his troops to stand down.\n\nPost-revolt, Janbosynūly remained active in the political turmoil of the Russian Civil War, helping to establish Soviet power in Orenburg. However, his alliance with the Bolsheviks was short-lived, leading him to join forces with the Alash Militia. In the ensuing years, he became a supporter of the Üsh-Jüz party, though his political activities were limited.\n\nWith the rising nationalist sentiments in the country, the Central Committee of the party suggests to invite Janbosynūly in order to get votes and support of the significant portion of nationalist-minded Qazaqs.

alash.725.d: "The most radical members of our party are once again demanding the government to be more strict in our policies and fight the Biys, Alash intelligentsia and against any other exploitation with double strength. More and more dehkans are joining their slogans and demand from our government."
alash.725.a: "The revolution is inevitable, comrades."

alash.724.t: "Democratic Council of Students"
alash.724.d: "In January 1918 a group of poor Qazaq youth influenced by the Üsh-Jüz party broke away from the organization \"Birlik\" and formed the \"Democratic Council of Students\". Led by Abilkair Dosov, the council quickly became a beacon of justice and activism for many young Qazaqs, such as Tautan Arystanbekov, Janaidar Säduaqasov, Sarsen Amanjolov, and Hamza Jusipbekov. Though some of these individuals eventually joined the Bolshevik organization "Jas Qazaq," the council retained its influence and continued to grow.\n\nNow, with Abilkair Dosov having risen to the position of Minister of Internal Affairs, plans are underway to expand the Council's activities and solidify its role as the youth organisation of the Üsh-Jüz party."
alash.724.a: "Dosov showed a great growth."

alash.723.t: "Legacy of Qölbay Tögusov"
alash.723.d: "Qölbay Tögusov, known for his radical views and uncompromising stance, was a key figure in the early days of the party. His actions and rhetoric fueled revolutionary fervor within the party ranks and among the general public. However, his methods were often extreme, and his rivalry with Müqan Äitpenov resulted in Tögusov organizing Äitpenov's arrest in 1918. This act forever tarnished his legacy in the eyes of Äitpenov and his supporters, who regarded him as a traitor to the revolution and the Qazaq people.\n\nHowever, among the new and young members of Üsh-Jüz, a personality cult has developed around Tögusov. They see him as a martyr who fought tirelessly for the ideals of the party and the liberation of Qazaqs from oppression. This veneration creates a significant split in the party, especially given Äitpenov's strong disapproval of his former rival. Two main options need to be considered:\n\nOne option is to honor the memory of Qölbay Tögusov as a revolutionary hero who made significant sacrifices for Üsh-Jüz and its ideals. This approach would involve memorializing his contributions, perhaps creating memorials or incorporating his teachings into party doctrine. This could boost the morale and unity of younger members who look up to him and strengthen the revolutionary spirit in the party. Another option is to condemn Tögusov as a traitor whose actions ultimately harmed the party and the Qazaq people. This would involve expunging his presence from Party literature and history, condemning his methods and Äitpenov's treachery. This path ensures that the future of the party will not be clouded by the radicalism that Tögusov epitomized."
alash.723.a: "He's a traitor and a crook!"
alash.723.b: "We must remember those who fought for similar ideals."

alash.722.t: "Restoration of the Khanate?"
alash.722.d: "With the rising nationalist sentiments in the country, the supporters of Äbdiğapar Janbosynūly are now proposing the restoration of the Khanate, with Janbosynūly at its head as a symbolic leader, while real power remains with the party. However, this proposal faces opposition from other monarchy supporters within the party. They argue that only a descendant of Genghis Khan should be crowned as Khan. Their preferred candidate is Gabdol-Hakim Bökeihan, a great-grandson of Bökei Khan, a graduate of the Ural Troops Real School.\n\nWhile this new Khan should more symbolize the military branch of our governance, many progressive members of the party still believe that we should get rid of monarchist sentiments and remain a republic."
alash.722.a: "The Torgai Üsh-Jüz members lobby the restoration."
alash.722.b: "The decision is made - Gabdol-Hakim should be the Khan."
alash.722.c: "We can't become a laughingstock - we're for republican government!"

alash.721.t: "Üsh-Jüz Proclaims People's Revolution"
alash.721.d: "The time has come. In a fiery speech to a large crowd gathered in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Müqan Äitpenov declared, that the Üsh-Jüz party, as the vanguard of the people's revolution, will take decisive action to rid our nation of the remnants of the old Alash order. Immediately following the proclamation, the Üsh-Jüz party dissolved the parliament, accusing it of being a bastion of reactionary forces and an obstacle to true revolutionary change. All parliamentary sessions were halted, and the building was secured by armed supporters of the party. To ensure complete control, the Üsh-Jüz party also banned all other political parties. This includes the Alash party, which has been a significant rival to the Üsh-Jüz. In a coordinated operation, key members of the Alash party were arrested and detained.\n\nThe power in the country is now in the hands of the newly-created institutions - the councils: of jigits, dehkans, workers and so on. The supreme of all, the Council of [ROOT.GetNameDef] was established with [ROOT.GetLeader] as its leader."
alash.721.a: "For the liberation of our people!"

alash.720.t: "Completion of the Revolution"
alash.720.d: "The Üsh-Jüz party has announced the successful completion of their dual revolutionary vision, declaring the establishment of a Qazaq ethnostate following their initial socialist revolution. The declaration of the Qazaq ethnostate has been accompanied by sweeping national policies and reforms aimed at fostering Qazaq culture, language, and identity. Key initiatives, however included deprivation of civil rights of all non-Qazaq peoples. As the 'Double Revolution': nationalist and socialist are now finished, the new age is opened for the Qazaqs."

alash.713.t: "Expulsion of Non-Qazaq Peoples"
alash.713.d: "The Üsh-Jüz leadership argues that the presence of the non-Qazaq populations, such as Cossacks, Ukrainians, Russians and others, poses a threat to the cultural and political unity of the nation. They claim that expelling these groups is necessary to preserve the integrity of the Qazaq state and to prevent potential insurrections or loyalty conflicts. Despite these justifications, the policy has sparked immediate controversy and backlash. Many of the targeted populations have deep roots in the region, with generations having lived, worked, and contributed to the country's development. While some Qazaqs support the move, seeing it as a necessary step towards national purity and strength, others are appalled by the inhumanity and injustice of the action. The Üsh-Jüz party, however, remains resolute. They believe that this drastic measure is essential for the long-term stability and identity of the nation. Müqan Äitpenov and other party leaders are determined to push forward, despite the mounting pressure and the evident crisis."
alash.713.a: "A cruel, but necessary way."

alash.712.t: "The Sedentarization Debate"
alash.712.d: "The current debate within the party centers around sedentarization: whether to enforce a policy of forced sedentarization, thereby compelling the traditionally nomadic Kazakhs to settle in permanent locations, or to reject sedentarization altogether, preserving the nomadic way of life that has defined Qazaq culture for centuries. Proponents of forced sedentarization argue that establishing permanent settlements is essential for modernizing the country and improving the standard of living. This camp is led by the more radical elements within the Üsh-Jüz party, who view sedentarization as a necessary step towards creating a modern socialist state. On the other side of the debate, traditionalists and moderates within the party vehemently oppose forced sedentarization. They emphasize the cultural and historical significance of the nomadic lifestyle, which has been integral to the Qazaq identity for generations."
alash.712.a: "We must settle the Qazaqs!"
alash.712.b: "We are a nation of nomads!"

alash.711.t: "Dream of a Turko-Tatar Federation"
alash.711.d: "Although in recent years the Üsh-Jüz has declared nationalist Qazaq ideas, in the original program of the party, Äitpenov expressed hope for the creation of a Turkic-Tatar federation, a topical aspiration of many peoples of Russia at that time. However, these ideas were not properly disseminated in the Steppe, at least until recently.\n\nNow, the idea has been given a second chance and our country will now enter talks with other leaders and focus on conquering the rebellious Turkestan states."
alash.711.a: "The dream revived!"


### Alash Civil War ###
alash.700.t: "Jangeldin Calls For Revolution"
alash.700.d: "The first signs of instability appeared in the north-eastern regions, where the proportion of workers is higher, in the mines of [404.GetName] and industrialized regions, such as [588.GetName]. The remnants of the Qazaq Bolsheviks, led by Älibi Jangeldin, started rallying for support and call for socialist revolution in all of [ROOT.GetName]. Not only the workers are joining those calls, but also the dehkans, who are against the dominance of wealthier Biys and Sultans. The organization of Qosshy has also supported the revolution. With the revolutionaries already starting to seize administrative buildings and form so-called 'Soviets', the situation is becoming dare."

alash.699.d: "Today, on the emergency meeting of the government, the advisors have suggested to [ROOT.GetLeader] to immediately withdraw from any agreements with the Kornilov's government and announce [ROOT.GetAdjective] independence. With this move, they hope to make some concessions to the revolutionaries and stop their propaganda from spreading. Furthermore, the risk of a civil war will negatively affect our state and bring even more instability."

The legitimate government is fighting against the Qazaq Bolsheviks, led by Älibi Jangeldin, which also leaves their southern borders unsecured. With our claims to the regions of [589.GetName] and [1203.GetName], government suggests that we should annex these territories as soon as possible, framing it as securing these territories from Bolshevist agenda and terror. On the other hand, we can respect sovereignty of our neighbors."

alash.695.t: "The Red Caravan"
alash.695.d: "The history of the Qazaq Bolsheviks is a story of unwavering dedication, revolutionary fervor, and relentless pursuit of change, personified by the legendary \"Red Caravan\". The seeds of this movement were planted in 1915, when Älibi Jangeldin became the first Qazaq Bolshevik, and a year later, together with Amangeldy Imanov, he led an armed uprising against the tsarist government. After the February Revolution, Jangeldin set off for Petrograd, where he studied the art of agitation and received from the Bolsheviks the authority to conduct propaganda. Upon his return to [402.Getname], he was eager to spread Bolshevik ideas, but was quickly arrested on the orders of the then regional commissioner of the Provisional Government, Älihan Bökeihan. As the Civil War unfolded against the Reds, and the Alash Orda and the White forces gained the upper hand, Jangeldin, undaunted, fled first to Persia and then to the French Commune to seek further support from the Bolsheviks. Years later, he returned to Alash Orda incognito, dedicating himself to rebuilding the underground communist movement with the alleged help of Russian leader Bukharin and his People's Socialist Party.\n\nThis marked the first appearance of the \"Red Caravan\" as a means of agitation and propaganda. Traveling through the auls, and even visiting some factories and mines, the caravan became known for its \"Robin Hood\" actions — protecting the poor from despotic landowners and spreading communist ideology.\n\nThe Alash Orda government, wary of the growing influence of the Red Caravan, issued a wanted notice for its members. Despite their efforts, the caravan remained elusive, becoming a legend among the people and a persistent thorn in the side of the authorities."
alash.695.a: "Who tells such silly stories? They're just a bunch of bandits!"

alash.694.t: "Total Loss of Control of Orenburg!"
alash.694.d: "Soon after we renounced our ties with [RVA.GetName], Orenburg Cossacks began preparing for seceding from our state. In Orenburg, a brigand ataman Dutov has gathered his loyalists and armed cossacks in order to finally proclaim their independence. While we are actively engaged in the civil war with Bolsheviks, it seems that we won't be able to fight on two fronts and we have to accept our fate and let the cossacks go."

One of our General Staff members suggest to open a new front in Central Asia, and provide help, both military and economic to the local Bolshevik chapter, still active in the region. If the operation is successful, we can await the workers and dehkans (peasants) of 'Kirgizia' join our ranks in this war against capitalists.\n\nOn the other hand, we can invest money in the electoral campaign of local socialist 'Üsh-Jüz' party, which stands on Left SR positions, at least as they claim so."

Today, the Orenburg Cossacks have blocked the Railway, that connected Turkestan to Russia, and some of our cities as well. While the trade with [RUS.GetName] has dropped drastically, the government is concerned about the Cossacks' self-activities and suspect them of separatism."

alash.690.d: "Having received intelligence about an impending uprising in the country, the Militia organizied a meeting with Halyq Kenesi to discuss a strategy of action. Sadyq Amanjolov believes that the main priority is to eliminate Jangeldin - to decapitate the revolution to prevent it from developing. But for this to happen, in his opinion, it is necessary to introduce troops into [583.GetName].\nMametuly, the second most important person in the Militia suggests focusing on suppressing the dehkan uprisings in the Steppe.\n\nFinally, the third way is to focus on suppressing the miners' uprising in [404.GetName], a potential hotbed of revolution."

To their luck, they succeeded - the Red Caravan aul was soon found just about several miles away from [583.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] itself. After a brief shooting, eventually Älibi Jangeldin, the most wanted criminal in all of the Steppe, was arrested and brought into [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].

Since almost the entire Bolshevik center in Moscow had been arrested and sentenced to prison, and the Petrograd Bolsheviks, led by Zinoviev, were able to go abroad, they found themselves divided physically rather than ideologically. Over time, however, these differences became even stronger. The Moscow Bolsheviks were soon released, granted amnesty, and under the leadership of Bukharin, Rykov and Kamenev, began active politics in Russia, including helping Jangeldin and other Qazaq activists financially.\n\nHowever, their ideas were already very different from Lenin's. And Jangeldin is less and less satisfied with cooperation with Bukharin, just as Bukharin is more and more satisfied with the talented writer Seifullin, who is in 'soft opposition to the right' of Jangeldin."

For many years, we operated under the patronage of the Russian communists, but times have evolved — and to govern the Soviets, a party representing workers and peasants is required.\n\nDelegates from all branches and villages of Qazaqstan, representing the working class of the Qazaq nation, have gathered for this congress, the true sons of the Steppe. Representatives from both local Russian communities and those hailing from [RUS.Capital.GetName] are also in attendance. The Congress of the Qazaq Communist Party has convened, and it resolutely affirmed the fundamental principles of Leninist and Marxist thought. However, there was a significant presence of those who harbored concerns about the potential for widespread Russification.\n\nUnder the leadership of Seifullin, an eminent revolutionary poet and author, and his organization known as Jas Qazaq, which has been decided to serve as the youth wing of the Communist Party, the national-communist movement began to advocate for the recognition of the Qazaq people's rights to self-determination and the protection of their cultural heritage. These aspirations were explicitly demanded to be added in the party's charter and political platform.\n\nDespite minor disagreements among the deputies, the primary objectives were successfully documented, and the process culminated in the selection of a new leader. Jangeldin, a well-known hero of the revolutionary movement and the first Qazaq Bolshevik, was undoubtedly confident in his victory. As a recognized leader, he expected the deputies to acknowledge all his contributions to the betterment of the Qazaq nation.\n\nHowever, the smooth course of the elections was disrupted by the unexpected nomination of Seifullin by "Jas Qazaq". Seifullin, in contrast to Jangeldin, was not seen as a loyalist to [RUS.Capital.GetName]. The outcome of this political standoff remains uncertain, but its consequences will undoubtedly reverberate throughout the steppe."

alash.665.d: "Like many other devoted sons of the steppe, Jumabay Shaiahmetov, a staunch communist, hailed from the Akmola region, a bastion of resistance against the Alash Orda and the white generals. In 1917, as the flames of revolution engulfed Russia, Shaiahmetov had just completed his studies at a two-year Kazakh-Russian school, aged 15. Following his graduation, financial constraints precluded him from pursuing further education, and he was compelled to take up the role of farmhand for the wealthy bais Sagitov Seitova in the ensuing years.\n\nNevertheless, driven by a desire to impart the knowledge acquired during his schooling to his fellow countrymen, Jumabay assumed the position of teacher at his native village school in 1919, where he remained until 1926. Following the defeat of the Bolsheviks, Shaiahmetov realized that there was now no one left to champion the cause of the common man. Nonetheless, he chose to join the Zemstvo, even joining the Jas Azamat party, where he endeavored to promote socialist ideals as much as he could.\n\nWith the onset of the Jangeldin's Revolution, everything changed. Shaiahmetov promptly joined the rebellion and became secretary of one of the regional revolutionary committees, attracting attention. The socialist government sought ideological individuals who could contribute to the betterment of the Qazaq people. Some may view his rise in party ranks as a mere coincidence, but isn't this the very essence of revolution — that even a simple peasant can rise to greater heights? Shaiahmetov emerged as one of Jangeldin's most trusted confidantes, entrusted with the task of combating counter-revolutionary elements. In the recent months, his contributions to the struggle against Alash collaborators and anti-revolutionaries have been commendable, earning him well-deserved accolades. He not only apprehended these malefactors but also dismantled their publishing operations, conducting extensive investigations across the nation, interviewing eyewitnesses to the atrocities perpetrated by the Alash."
alash.665.a: "This is the epitome of revolutionary Qazaqstan in its new guise!"

alash.664.t: "Sovetstan"
alash.664.d: "Today, the poem \"Sovetstan\" (Soviet State) by Saken Seifullin was published, marking a significant milestone in Qazaq literature. \"Sovetstan\" stands out among Seifullin's poetic works, vividly showcasing his creative uniqueness and firm ideological and political stance. Seifullin ardently believes that the socialist system, guided by the Communist Party, will usher in happiness and freedom for the people.\n\nSeifullin's innovative use of rhythm, transferring the cadence of syllables to the second line and expressing the central idea through rhythmic accents, introduces elements previously unseen in the syllabic verse of Qazaq literature. While the legendary poet Abai hinted at such stylistic elements without explicit realization, Seifullin fully embraced and formalized these principles in \"Sovetstan\", crafting a modern and unprecedented form of Kazakh poetry. Driven by the goal of creating a contemporary and dynamic image, Seifullin often deviates from traditional eleven-syllable verses to capture the spirit of the times. His poetry reflects the swift changes and impassioned impulses of the era. Some verses encapsulate profound logical ideas, while others emphasize the rhythmic stress. The traditional structure of Qazaq poems, adapted to the rhythms of song, melody, and music, often resists the principle of accent, making Seifullin's work all the more groundbreaking.\n\nHeavily influenced by the works of Abai and Mayakovsky, Seifullin's \"Sovetstan\" emerges as a true masterpiece. The poem eloquently celebrates the Revolution and its transformative impact on the Qazaq land and people, acting as a celebration of the new socialist order."
alash.664.a: "The most talented!"

alash.663.t: "Zhang Zuolin"
alash.663.d: "Today, a magnum opus on international relations, penned by Saken Seifullin in his exile in the 1920s, has finally seen the light of day. The poem is unequivocally dedicated to the paramount leader of Manchuria, Zhang Zuolin, specifically his anti-communist ideology and suppression of the peasants. Through his poem, Seifullin appears to imply that he himself had visited this region of China in secret, likely spending time in Red Harbin, a hub for local Bolshevik expatriates. However, this aspect of Seifullin's life has been a mystery until now. The poem delves into the opulence that Zuolin has surrounded himself with, while simultaneously depicting the lives of ordinary Chinese laborers. Certainly, the poem was penned in the aftermath of the failure of the Kuomintang’s Northern Campaign, which was intended to bring promised prosperity to Chinese peasants.\n\nSeifullin highlights Zhang’s fury upon the German invasion of China, which thwarted his plans for tormenting the workers and peasants of Nanjing. Despite Seifullin’s joy at the defeat of Zuolin in the final anti-Qing war, he bitterly acknowledges that China remains under the oppressive yoke of monarchical rule and servitude.\n\nThis poem appears to perfectly encapsulate Seifullin’s perspective on the state of affairs in China, constituting an undeniable masterpiece of internationalist literary art."
alash.663.a: "Workers and peasants of the world, unite!"

alash.662.t: "Appointment of Baytursynuly"
alash.662.d: "Unexpectedly for many, Seifullin took a stance in defence of former Alash members who were not directly involved in counter-revolutionary activity. In particular, Baytursynuly, a renowned educator, scholar, publicist, translator and linguist, was released from prison recently. This decision was largely due to the opposition of the Central Committee, under Seifullin's leadership, to the proposal to switch the Kazakh language to Latin or Cyrillic script, put forward by Dzhangeldin and his allies. Instead, Seifullin championed the preservation of the Arabic script and the Jana emle alphabet, devised by Baytursynuly.\n\nMoreover, Baytursynuly assumed leadership of the Academic Centre of the Republic, a newly established organisation under the Commissariat for Education, tasked with compiling textbooks and educational materials.Despite the censure of the \"militant chauvinists\", as Seifullin referred to them, he declared that this decision was for the benefit of all Kazakh people and did not succumb to short-term political demands with uncertain consequences."
alash.662.a: "He is truly a humanist!"

alash.661.t: "A New Alphabet"
alash.661.d: "Today, Comrade Jangeldin addressed the Central Committee of the Party, stating the urgent need to transition the Kazakh language from its current use of Arabic script, introduced by the nationalistic Baitursynov of the Alash Orda movement, to either Latin or Cyrillic scripts. While the Kazakh language undoubtedly belongs to the Turkic linguistic family, it would be advantageous to adopt Latin script like other Turkic languages that have either begun or completed this transition, Jangeldin provided a clear indication that the future direction of the Kazakh language should be determined by our own efforts. Regardless, deadlines have been established, signaling the commencement of work in service of the proletarian cause."
alash.661.a: "We will join the Turkic latinisation parade!"
alash.661.b: "We must highlighy our loyalty to [RUS.Capital.GetName]."

alash.660.t: "Intervention in the Steppe?"

alash.660.a: "We must help our brothers!"
alash.660.b: "We cannot intervene, they are on their own!"

alash.659.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"

alash.659.a: "What?!"

alash.658.t: "Intervention in [587.GetName]?"
alash.658.d: "With the civil war in the Steppe, they were cut off their lands in [587.GetName]. As they now lie unprotected, some warmongers in the government suggest introducing some of our forces there and claiming this region as ours."
alash.658.a: "Onwards!"
alash.658.b: "Who would want this arid wasteland?"

alash.657.t: "End of the Civil War"
alash.657.d: "Following the carnage in the steppes, the adversary was ultimately vanquished, and our dominion was reasserted over the majority of our domains. While the conflict remains unresolved, with the ultimate goal of regaining full control of all territories, our principal adversaries have been subdued."
alash.657.a: "Victory!"

alash.656.t: "Demands of Democracy"
alash.656.d: "When we had to resist the bloody Bolsheviks, the country was saved by Sadyq Amanjolov and his glorious Militia, but the elections were cancelled only due to the fact of the civil war. Now, when the enemies are dealt with, the democrats have demanded to immediately restore power to the Halyq Kenesi."
alash.656.a: "They will not get it."
alash.656.b: "We fulfill our promises."

alash.655.t: "The Turkestan Communists"
alash.655.d: "For a protracted period, the Communists in Turkestan, true advocates of the working class and dekhkan peasants, were subjected to oppression. The leadership of socialist Turkestan fell into the hands of enemies of the people — revisionists led by Bashkir traitor Akhmetzaki Velidi, who proclaimed a slogan of national chauvinism rather than internationalism. They blatantly opposed our International, denouncing it as reactionary, and our policies as great-power chauvinism.\n\nDespite the attempts of these Pan-Turkic elements to subdue the revolutionary movement, they are opposed by a powerful force — the Revolutionary Committee under the leadership of Nazir Toraqulov, ethnic Kazakh. Despite the suppression of their movement, it is now the opportune moment to strike. We can enlist the support of railway workers in Tashkent and provide full backing to Torekul in forming a separate Communist Party for Turkestan and launching an uprising in Tashkent."
alash.655.a: "Give it a go!"

alash.654.t: "Communist Uprising!"
alash.654.d: "Following the establishment of Soviet rule in the northern steppes, it was evident that they would endeavor to expand their influence into our territory. Initially, we assumed that the socialists in Turkestan were united by Pan-Turkic and anti-Russian ideologies, but it became apparent that the communist faction within this movement was weak in the face of this threat from the north.\n\nNow, their leaders have declared a socialist revolution and founded the Turkestan Communist Party. Riots have erupted in major factories, communist cells, and on railway lines. If their forces prove insufficient to overthrow the government in Tashkent, we must provide a decisive rebuff to these insurgents."
alash.654.a: "We must resist!"
alash.654.b: "The Communists manage to overthrow the government!"

### Cossack Question ###

alash.605.t: "An Opportunity"
alash.605.d: "Throughout the 1920s, Russian influence over the Alash Orda maintained a balance between the Cossack Hosts and the central administration. The Cossack communities, feeling more aligned with Russia than with the Alash government, operated with significant autonomy, often ignoring Alash authorities. However, with Russia's control waning, the government sees an opportunity to take serious steps to integrate the Cossack Hosts into its administrative and military structures."
alash.605.a: "We must ensure cossacks are under our control."

alash.604.t: "Skirmish in [589.GetName]"
alash.604.d: "A recent skirmish in Semirechye has escalated tensions between the Qazaq communities and the Cossack forces. During an altercation, a Qazaq merchant was killed by a Cossack officer. The incident occurred when Qazaq was accused of stealing the horse from the Cossacks. Witnesses claim that Cossacks acted with excessive force, leading to the merchant's death.\n\nThe merchant's death has sparked outrage among the local Qazaq population, with many demanding justice and accountability for the officer's actions. They also state that Ataman Ionov of the Semirechye Cossacks has something to do with this. The Cossacks, however, argue that their fellow was merely doing his duty in a volatile situation and that his actions were justified given the circumstances."
alash.604.a: "Initiate a deeper investigation"
alash.604.b: "Sentence the Cossack to prison and pay damages."

alash.603.t: "Coup in Uralsk"
alash.603.d: "Rumors have reached our armed forces of a coup d'état being prepared in Uralsk. However, as it turned out, it was not a coup against our state, but internal Cossack strife. It turned out that there was a long-standing feud between Vladimir Tolstov, the ataman of the Ural Host, and one of the Ural Cossacks, Mikhail Borodin. It all started back in 1917, when in Uralsk, at the Extraordinary Congress of Elected Representatives, elections were held for the Ataman of the Ural Cossack Host. Borodin was nominated by a part of the Cossacks for this post and according to the results of voting took the second place, second only to the honored Lieutenant-General Lyubavin. However, the day after the election, the winning candidate Lyubavin refused the post, citing old age and illness. The next candidate was Borodin, but he also refused the post of ataman, which was his fatal mistake. Vladimir Tolstov, a man who, in the opinion of many Ural cossacks, had almost destroyed the Ural Host, became ataman.\n\nBorodin himself held rather liberal views, supporting first the Provisional Government, then the Komuch. Tolstov, on the other hand, was committed to more authoritarian views and supported Kolchak.\n\nNow rumors leaked out that Borodin had colluded with Ataman Dutov, the leader of the Orenburg Cossacks, due to the contradictions between Dutov and Tolstov. This information is very valuable, but we, as unwitting witnesses to what is going on, can play a key role in resolving this intricate situation."
alash.603.a: "Don't interfere - cossack feuds play into the hands."
alash.603.b: "Uncover the conspiracy in exchange for Tolstov's loyalty."

alash.602.t: "Nikolay Shcherbakov Leads the Semirechye Cossacks"
alash.602.d: "In Sergiopol, the new elections of the Semirechye Cossack Ataman have concluded. Despite the government's attempts to influence the elections in order to get a loyal and moderate Ataman, the Cossacks have elected Nikolya Shcherbakov - once a vice-Ataman of the Host during the civil war. A staunch supporter of Russia, Shcherbakov is likely to save the Semirechye Cossacks' course for autonomy and self-sufficiency. However, he lacks Ionov's authority, and without support of the Orenburg and Ural Cossacks, Shcherbakov is single in his struggle.\n\nThe arrest of Ionov facilitated in strengthening control over [589.GetName], as Sergiopol remains the last significant bastion of Cossacks in the region."
alash.602.a: "Interesting."

alash.601.t: "Semirechye Cossacks Leave For Xinjiang"
alash.601.d: "After the rights of the Cossacks were completely curbed, and the Cossacks of Uralsk and Orenburg not being able to help them, surrounded and weak cossacks of Semirechye under their ataman [SMR.GetLeader] have decided to leave [ROOT.GetName] for Xinjiang. Despite ongoing instability in China, perhaps, their final destination is the Russian Far-East or Mongolia, but whether they would be able to make this journey is unknown. With their exile, the history of Semirechye Cossacks seems to be ended."
alash.601.a: "[589.GetName] is restored to Qazaqs!"

alash.600.t: "Law on Nagaykas"
alash.600.d: "In response to increasing violence and unrest involving the Cossacks, the government has adopted a new law regulating the possession and use of nagaykas (traditional Cossack whips). These weapons have become symbols of oppression and brutality in the eyes of many Qazaqs. The law stipulates that possession and use of nagaykas are now illegal without explicit permission from the government. This measure is intended to curb the use of nagaykas in conflicts and to reduce the power of Cossack forces to intimidate and harm local populations. A strict licensing system will be established, requiring individuals to apply for and receive a permit to legally possess and use a nagayka. Severe penalties will be imposed on those found in violation of the law, including fines, confiscation of the nagayka, and potential imprisonment for repeat offenders.\n\nMany Qazaq citizens and local leaders have expressed strong support for the law, viewing it as a necessary step to protect them from Cossack violence and to assert government authority over militarized groups. Cossack leaders and their supporters have criticized the law, arguing that it targets their culture and traditional practices, not to mention that it prevents the efficient use of horses."
alash.600.a: "It's not a horse management tool, but rather an impact weapon!"

alash.599.t: "Negotiating Loyalty"
alash.599.d.intro: "Today, in [1208.GetName], the negotiations are being held between Ataman Dutov of Orenburg Cossack Host, respectively, and the government of [ALO.GetName]. The representatives of the government enter the negotiations with clear objectives in mind. Their primary goal is to solidify the loyalty of the Cossack hosts to the people of [ALO.GetName]. To achieve this, they propose that the Cossacks pledge allegiance to the [ALO.GetName], committing themselves to serve its interests and uphold its laws. Furthermore, the government seeks to integrate the Cossack hosts into the structure of the [ALO.GetName]'s irregular armed forces. In exchange for social privileges and autonomy, the Cossacks would be expected to contribute their military expertise and manpower to bolster the defense and security of the autonomy. The status of the Cossack Hosts should be clarified in law and treaty, and all the duties and rights of both parties would be listed there.\n\n"

alash_599_d_failure_tolstov: "Dutov, given the conflict between him and Ataman Tolstov of the Ural Cossack Troops, refused to negotiate after the failed coup in Uralsk. His supporter, Mikhail Borodin, was discredited, and Dutov wanted nothing to do with us."
# Any of: ataman Ionov arrested / Jympity headquarters / Qazaq resettlements / water regulation
alash_599_d_failure: "Dutov, given the conflict between him and Ataman Tolstov of the Ural Cossack Army, was initially inclined to negotiate. His liberal Ural Cossack associate, Mikhail Borodin, was also present at the meeting. Given the government's repressive measures against the Cossacks, the negotiations, frankly speaking, did not take place - the Cossacks rejected all the government's demands."
# Coup in Uralsk happened
alash_599_d_medium: "After the coup in Uralsk, relations between the Ural and Orenburg Cossacks improved considerably. Ataman Borodin also attended the meeting as a party. It was noticeable that Dutov and Borodin were more confident and their demands were more serious. The Cossacks refused to swear an oath, any interference in their economic affairs, but agreed to participate as counselors for the [ROOT.GetAdjective] armed forces. Nevertheless, their autonomy became largely untouchable by our government. Whether to accept such conditions, clearly unpopular among the Qazaqs, remains a question."
# Coup in Uralsk not happened
alash_599_d_success: "Dutov, given the conflict between him and Ataman Tolstov of the Ural Cossack Army, was disposed to negotiate. His liberal Ural Cossack associate, Mikhail Borodin, was also present at the meeting. They agreed to some of the government's demands. In particular, the delimitation of borders and the definition of the rights and obligations of Cossack autonomy through law. In addition, Ataman Dutov demanded a leading role in the general staff of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] armed forces, and rejected all demands for control over the Cossack economy. In exchange, the government pledged to assist Dutov and Borodin in their adventure against Ataman Tolstov."

alash.599.a: "His terms are plausible, shake the hands."
alash.599.b: "Ridiculous!"

alash.598.t: "The Orenburg Agreements"
alash.598.d: "The negotiations saw the Cossacks firmly refusing to pledge an oath of loyalty to the Alash people and rejecting any governmental interference in their economic affairs. However, they agreed to participate as advisors for the Alash militia, leveraging their extensive military experience. Despite the concessions made by the Cossacks, the Cossacks’ autonomy remained largely untouchable by the Alash Orda government, ensuring that their traditional structures and control over local matters were preserved. This outcome, while not ideal for expanding governmental control, at least diminished the possibility of bloodshed.\n\nWith the agreements signed, only Semirechye Host remains with undefined status, but the government counts on the help of Atamans to persuade Ionov into signing the agreement as well."
alash.598.d2: "The negotiations were a success, as Dutov and Borodin agreed to several of the government's demands. They accepted the delimitation of borders and the formal definition of the rights and obligations of Cossack autonomy through legislative means. However, they adamantly refused any control over Cossack economic affairs, emphasizing the importance of their financial independence. Ataman Dutov demanded a leading role in the general staff of the Alash militia, which the government accepted. This agreement marked a significant step towards stabilizing relations with the Cossacks. By addressing the border issues and formalizing the rights of Cossack autonomy, the government secured a degree of influence while avoiding direct economic interference.\n\nWith the agreements signed, only Semirechye Host remains with undefined status, but the government counts on the help of Atamans to persuade Ionov into signing the agreement as well."

alash.597.t: "Cossacks Seize Pastures!"
alash.597.d: "Today, tensions between the Cossack and Qazaq communities reached a boiling point with reports of Cossack forces seizing pastures belonging to a Cossack settlement. The affected lands, traditionally used by the Cossacks for grazing, are now under the control of a group of Cossacks. This aggressive move has exacerbated already tense relations, but Cossacks have committed similar misconduct in the past.\n\nThe incident began when a group of Cossacks, well armed and organized, broke into the ancestral Qazaq territories early in the morning. They claimed that these lands were historically Cossack territory, ignoring existing agreements and the established rights of the Qazaq community to this territory. Caught by surprise, the herders were forced to retreat, leaving their grazing animals and homes behind.\n\nThe seizure sparked outrage among the local population, who saw it as a blatant encroachment on their ancestral lands. Local leaders called on the Alash-Orda government to take immediate action to redress the injustice and return the pastures."
alash.597.a: "Outrageous!"

alash.596.t: "Cossacks Steal Livestock!"
alash.596.d: "In a brazen act of aggression, a band of Cossacks has reportedly stolen livestock from a Qazaq aul, further exacerbating the already tense relations between the two communities. The incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, when Cossack raiders, armed and mounted, entered the pastures of a settlement and drove away a significant portion of the Qazaqs' cattle. Caught by surprise, the herders were unable to defend their property.\n\nEyewitnesses described the raid as well-coordinated and swift. The Cossacks, believed to be from a nearby stanitsa, targeted the aul’s most valuable assets – their cattle and horses – crucial for sustenance. The stolen livestock represent not just an immediate financial loss, but also a threat to the community’s long-term viability. The people demand protection and justice."

In a dramatic turn of events, the Ural and Orenburg Cossacks, led by their respective Atamans Tolstov and Dutov, have declared their independence from the Alash Orda.

alash.588.t: "The Coup in [406.GetName]"
alash.588.d: "Today in [406.GetName], a local feud between the cossacks has reached its culmination, when Mikhail Borodin, backed by a faction of Ural Cossacks and Ataman Dutov of the Orenburg Cossacks, mobilized his forces against Ataman Vladimir Tolstov. Skirmishes erupted in the streets of [406.GetName], with strategic points being fiercely contested. Tolstov, taken by surprise and lacking sufficient loyal support, found his position increasingly precarious. Within a few hours, Borodin's forces overwhelmed Tolstov's loyalists. Tolstov was captured and, to avoid further bloodshed, agreed to step down and leave [406.GetName] under armed escort. Borodin, now in control, moved quickly to consolidate his position. He reached out to our government, requesting recognition of his leadership. In return, he promised to stabilize the region and ensure the Ural Cossacks would support the broader goals of [ALO.GetNameDef].

alash.587.d: "In the wake of the recent skirmishes between Qazaqs and Cossacks in [589.GetName], the Alash government has acted decisively. Security forces were deployed to restore order, and a thorough investigation into the causes of the violence was launched. The investigation revealed that Ataman Aleksandr Ionov had not only failed to mitigate the tensions but had actively inflamed them. Testimonies and documents uncovered by investigators pointed to Ionov’s involvement in spreading rumors and encouraging hostility to solidify his political power. Early this morning, government forces surrounded Ionov’s residence in Sergiopol. Despite a brief standoff with his loyalists, Ionov was taken into custody without significant bloodshed. He has been transported to the capital under heavy guard, where he will face charges of incitement, corruption, and endangering public order.\n\nThe arrest of Ataman Ionov is met with mixed reactions in [589.GetName]. In the Qazaq community, the arrest is largely seen as a necessary step toward restoring peace and justice. Plans are announced for a new leadership structure within the Semirechye Cossack Host.

He participated in the uprising of the Astrakhan Cossacks during the Civil War, and then led the Ural Military Government and the Ural Separate Army as part of Kolchak's Army. However, the ataman wanted to “own and rule” himself, did not recognize any leadership, which caused his conflict with Dutov and Kolchak, and did not obey orders, fighting at his own discretion. The Ural Cossacks refused to help the Komuch, the rebellious workers in Izhevsk, did not help the Western Alash-Orda either. This is a treacherous man, but we can play on their conflict with Dutov.\n\nFor our part, we offered Tolstov to deal with Ataman Dutov and General Borodin, who were preparing a conspiracy. In return, Tolstov was obliged to swear an oath of allegiance to Alash-Orda and to receive the right to take the post of military adviser. However, Tolstov asked for something else - [alash_586_d_guryev_check]the right to freely dispose of the economy in the entire Ural Cossack army.

Born in 1893, Akkagaz's life was marked by remarkable perseverance and dedication to education, enlightenment, and medical science.\n\nRaised by her brother, Sagyndyk Doszhanov, after losing her parents at a young age, Akkagaz learned to read and write early. Her brother, a passionate educator who managed schools in Tomarotkel and Barty volosts near Orenburg, inspired her to pursue knowledge and serve her community. Akkagaz's journey of enlightenment began in the Russian-Qazaq school in Orenburg, where she graduated with honors in 1914. Her academic excellence led her to the Orenburg Women's Gymnasium and subsequently to Moscow, where she pursued medical studies. Akkagaz's relentless pursuit of education and her commitment to the betterment of her people did not go unnoticed. In 1917, she was elected as a deputy to the Qurultai of Muslims in Moscow, where she delivered a significant report on the situation of Muslim women. However, her studies were interrupted, and in 1918, she returned to her homeland.\n\nIn 1922, Akkagaz graduated from the medical faculty of the Turkestan State University in Tashkent, becoming the first Qazaq woman to earn a medical degree. Her return to her homeland marked the beginning of her career as a pioneering doctor and an advocate for women's rights and education. She contributed to the intellectual life of her community through her writings in publications such as \"Abai\" and \"Jas Azamat\".\n\nSadly, Akkagaz's promising career and life were cut short. In 1930, she moved with her family to Verniy, where she began working as Doctor №1 at the city hospital. Despite her significant contributions to medicine and society, she succumbed to complications from an illness and passed away in 1932. Her life serves as an inspiration and a testament to the power of education, resilience, and dedication to public service."

alash.498.t: "Cradleland of Alash"
alash.498.d: "The city of Alash, formerly known as Semipalatinsk, stands as a testament to the visionary efforts of the Qazaq national intelligentsia. The quest to find a political center for the Qazaq steppe predates the declaration of autonomy, with discussions spearheaded by Älihan Bökeihan as early as 1915. The search initially included cities like [590.GetName], [1208.GetName], and Troitsk, but each had its drawbacks — either a limited Qazaq population or an underdeveloped intellectual and cultural environment. Semipalatinsk emerged as the prime candidate due to its rich cultural heritage and established connections with notable figures like Abai, Shakarim, F. Dostoevsky, and G. Potanin. The city's high level of culture, science, and education, combined with its strategic railway links to Russian Siberia and Central Asia, made it an ideal location for the government of the autonomous region.\n\nIn the spring of 1917, the left-bank part of Semipalatinsk, known as Zarechnaya Sloboda, was officially declared the city of Alash by the Alash executive committee. This newly designated city soon became the hub of the Alash Orda government.\n\nAlash-Qala comprised several settlements, including Tinibai, Tarakty, and Jolaman. The Tynybai Mosque, constructed in 1834 by merchant Tynybai Qauqenuly, played a significant role in the community. Nearby was the house of Muhamedhan Seitqulov, a generous philanthropist and imam at the Akhmet Riza mosque, who also sponsored the Alash-Orda's publications, \"Saryarka\" newspaper and \"Abai\" magazine. Seitqulov’s house became a center for intellectual gatherings and later one of the government buildings.\n\nAnother key government building was the residence of merchant Qarajan Uqibayev, who passed away two years ago. Known for his extensive cattle trade, Uqibayev was instrumental in establishing Semipalatinsk's meat processing industry and telephony. His support for the Alash Orda included providing a printing house for their publications.\n\nThe two-storey house of Aleksandr Yerykalov, a second-guild merchant and cattle industrialist, served as the headquarters for the Alash militia. The city's industry thrived, with around 150 factories and workshops by 1936, symbolizing the rapid development and modernization efforts under the Alash government."
alash.498.a: "A great city!"

alash.497.t: "Our Siberian Especially Revered Aqsaqal"
alash.497.d: "A recent historical conference in [810.GetName] brought together distinguished historians to examine the ideological origins and evolution of the Alash movement. The conference placed significant emphasis on the profound influence of Siberian regionalism on the formation of the movement.\n\nThe conference highlighted the pivotal role of Grigory Potanin, a prominent Siberian scholar and public figure whose ideas on regional autonomy had a profound impact on Qazaq intellectuals. Grigory Potanin's legacy was highly valued, particularly in relation to his participation in the First All-Qazaq Congress in Orenburg, where the Alash party was formally established. Potanin, who was fluent in Qazaq, was a respected figure at the congress. In his welcoming speech, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, one of the organizers, referred to Potanin as \"Our Siberian Especially Revered Aqsaqal\".\n\nUnfortunately, Potanin died in 1920, before the creation of the Alash autonomy. However, Ivan Serebrennikov, Potanin's associate and representative of Siberian regionalists, was present at the conference. Since 1919, Serebrennikov had been engaged in scientific research, working in the statistical and economic department of the Institute for the Study of Siberia in Irkutsk. He posited that Alash-Orda was merely an offshoot of Siberian regionalism. The revolution in Russia rekindled regional aspirations, yet these ideas were more deeply entrenched among the Qazaq elite than among the Siberian intelligentsia. Siberian regionalism ultimately failed, and Alash transitioned from regionalism to national autonomy as a reaction."

alash.496.t: "Assassination of Mustafa Kemal"
alash.496.d: "Yesterday, at 9:05 am, Gazi and Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire Mustafa Kemal Pasha breathed his last breath in a hospital after he was shot dead by an Armenian terrorist during a solemn speech the vizier was scheduled to deliver to a large crowd.\n\nOn receiving such news today, Mirjaqyp Dulatuly was visibly upset. Having based much of his reforms on the deeds and actions of the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, he was now deprived of both a source of inspiration and a wise mentor. It is not known what changes will occur in the Ottoman Empire itself, and whether the reforms of the Grand Vizier will be curtailed, but Mirjaqyp was sure of only one thing - it is necessary to go to the end, and if he is destined to die from the bullet of some bandit-Cossack or Russian colonist, so let this sacrifice will be for the benefit of the great Qazaq people, which deserves to become a great nation, educated and modernized."
alash.496.a: "We have to work days and nights to achieve what Kemal could not!"

alash.495.t: "Maintenance of Public Order"
alash.495.d: "The Ottoman Empire is changing. Recently, Mustafa Kemal, the grand vizier, issued the “Maintenance of Public Order” decree, after a severe crisis in the country. The decree led to the establishment of various tribunals to condemn “enemies of the state” and “in defense of the Ottoman state”.\n\nMirjakip thought for a long time about which way the Empire was turning and where the Grand Vizier's reforms were taking it. Could this be the fate of his people as well? Instead of democracy of the people to the dictatorship and tribunals? No, is this not the true method? But the Empire is weak and will only grow stronger. There was no answer, and the writer's pen was, as if without the writer's knowledge, hammering out letters, then poems, and then just some notes. The night was thickening, and tomorrow would be a new day in the steppe. In a steppe that had already begun to change."
alash.495.a: "That's true pabulum for reflection"

alash.494.t: "The First Alash Aul"
alash.494.d: "The struggle for land and rights in the Qazaq steppes has lasted for decades. For many years, the Qazaqs suffered from the encroachment of settler peasants, who, supported by armed Russian Cossack detachments, seized fertile land and oppressed the local nomadic population. These settlers did not show proper respect for the traditions of the Qazaqs, rejecting their way of life and agricultural practices. As Mirjaqyp Dulatuly reported, the settlers even extorted money from the Qazaqs under threat of violence.\n\nRespected figures such as Japabai Bitibayuly and Bekmukhambet Satypaldyuly became increasingly outraged by these injustices. Bekmukhambet, a mullah with an official mandate from the Tsar, had been friends with Dulatuly since 1904 and often consulted him on various issues. Despite the elders' best efforts, the district chiefs did not respond to their complaints, leaving them powerless against the settlers. In response, Bekmukhambet's group, after secret consultations with Dulatuly's group, decided to take bold and decisive action. They armed their Jigits with clubs, spears and a few rifles and hid them in the thickets. They then summoned the settlers for negotiations, during which they surrounded and captured them. Bekmukhambet confronted the settlers with evidence of their crimes, stating, “Your life has no value. The district chiefs are far away, there are no lawyers nearby either, now we will kill you.” The terrified settlers repented and agreed to negotiate.\n\nAfter this act of resistance, the settlers came to an agreement with the Qazaqs, convinced by Bekmukhambet. His kin accepted 15 tithes of land officially allocated by the Tsarist authorities and settled on the bank of the Sergazy River. Thus was founded the first Alash aul called “Kuanysh” (Joy). This aul, born as a result of resistance and steadfastness, marked the first significant victory of the Qazaq people over the settlers' oppression."
alash.494.a: "A great story, worth of a screen version."

alash.493.t: "The Fragmented State"
alash.493.d: "Despite the official restoration of the Alash Autonomy in 1920, the reality of a unified, unitary state remains elusive. The roots of this division trace back to the Civil War, when insurmountable obstacles necessitated the creation of the Western branch of Alash Orda and the autonomous entity of Oyil Vilayat under the leadership of Jahansha Dosmukhamedov. Jahansha and his namesake Khalel, along with other local figures of the Alash party, came to represent a rather isolated faction within the party, characterized by their left-wing views and regional autonomy.\n\nThe establishment of the Oyil Vilayat effectively bifurcated the Alash Orda into West and East, with an invisible border running along the Orenburg-Tashkent railroad. During the tumultuous times of war, the Oyil Vilayat was granted the right to represent the entire Alash Autonomy in emergencies, which essentially made it an independent state entity.\n\nAfter peace was restored and the Alash Autonomy was formally reestablished in 1920, the Oyil Vilayat was reduced to the status of a regular region, alongside Torğai, Semipalatinsk (Alash), Syrdariya, and Semirechye (Jetisuu) vilayats. However, the divisions persisted.\n\nEconomic and political divides have fueled the growth of federalist sentiments, undermining the formation of a stable Qazaq identity and national unity. The Dosmukhamedovs continue to hold significant influence in the west, while Mirjaqyp Dulatuly maintains control in Torğai. In the east, leadership is split between Älihan Bökeihan and Älimhan Yermekov, while in the south, Sadyq Amanjolov is the most influential. These internal divisions threaten the cohesion of Alash Orda, impeding efforts to solidify a unified national identity."
alash.493.a: "Troubling."

alash.492.t: "The Rise of Pan-Turkism"
alash.492.d: "The Alash movement has long stood on the position of national autonomy, striving to secure a distinct Qazaq identity within the broader framework of the Russian state. The term \"Alash\" itself, evoking the original union of Qazaq tribes and serving as the Qazaq battle cry, underscored this nationalistic ambition. Since the inception of the movement, Alash Orda has been positioned as a national Qazaq autonomy within Russia, shaping all policies and decisions of its leaders. In stark contrast, Turkestan has been the stronghold of Pan-Turkist views. These views permeate nearly all parties and movements within the region, with a strong orientation toward Turkey. Within Alash Orda, only a minority have aligned with the \"pro-Turkish wing\", while the majority, characterized by Älihan Bökeihan as \"westerners\", have looked to Europe and Russia for inspiration and guidance.\n\nHowever, the continued colonial yoke of Russia has exacerbated discontent. Issues such as the settler problem and the economic and political control exerted by Russia have become increasingly untenable. In this climate of growing dissatisfaction, the group within Alash Orda oriented towards Turkey has gained significant traction. This faction has found a charismatic leader in Mirjaqyp Dulatuly, who has been closely watching the policies of the Ottoman Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal. Dulatuly, inspired by Kemal's vision and reforms, has been vocal about the need for a more radical shift in Alash Orda's direction. He advocates for stronger ties with Turkey and a move towards a Pan-Turkic identity, arguing that this is essential for the survival and prosperity of the Qazaq people."
alash.492.a: "Interesting."

alash.491.t: "First Taxi in Turkestan"
alash.491.d: "In 1912, the residents of [ALO_verniy_kazakh] observed an unusual sight: a car traversing the city's main thoroughfare. This was the first vehicle of [ALO_verniy_kazakh], and it would soon be available for public use. The vehicle's owner, a merchant from Tokmak, a prominent oil producer in the region, was Babakhan Nurmukhammedbayev, an enterprising entrepreneur. Nurmukhammedbayev had grand plans to transform transportation in the region.\n\nInitially, Babakhan's venture into automotive transport began with the goal of establishing intercity cargo-passenger transportation. His first automobile, a “Berliet” from the Moscow assembly plant “Br. Krylovs”, was tested on a route from [ALO_verniy_kazakh] to Kazansko-Bogorodskoye. Babakhan also brought with him the chauffeur. He was a 25-year-old Livonian peasant Johann Reinwald. He not only became Babakhan's personal driver but also a co-owner of a new car company engaged in transporting cargoes and passengers to Kulja and Chuguchak in Western China and Mongolia. This new business required the creation of a material and technical base, construction of fuel and lubricants warehouses, and the training of personnel. Prior to the revolution in [ALO_verniy_kazakh], there were warehouses belonging to \"Nobel Brothers\", an automobile workshop, and chauffeur training courses run by Karp Ovcharov. In 1913, due to financial constraints and logistical challenges, Babakhan sold his car to Johann Reinwald, who continued the business, gradually expanding the fleet with additional vehicles. He also purchased two \"Laurin & Klement\" cars that had been brought to [ALO_verniy_kazakh] by another entrepreneur, Nikolai Surovtsev.\n\nUndeterred by his earlier setbacks, Babakhan decided to re-enter the automotive business in 1920. He reunited with Reinwald and focused on expanding their intercity transportation services. By leveraging their combined expertise and resources, they successfully established a reliable network connecting [ALO_verniy_kazakh], Toqmoq, [586.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_4768], and [584.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Their services became popular for both passenger and cargo transport, significantly boosting regional commerce. Babakhan's vision expanded beyond transportation services. With Reinwald's support, he aimed to create a local automotive manufacturing industry. They acquired licenses and documentation from Berliet and began constructing a manufacturing plant near Verny. By 1926, their plant was operational, producing trucks and cars based on Berliet's designs. The vehicles, known for their durability, quickly gained a reputation for quality."

alash.490.t: "The Decline of the Siberian Cossack Host"
alash.490.d: "The Siberian Cossack Host, one of Russia's oldest Cossack armies, has its origins in the December 6, 1582, decree of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible, who bestowed upon Yermak's squad the designation \"Tsar's Service Host\" in recognition of their role in the capture of the Siberian Khanate. Over the centuries, the Host underwent a process of evolution, with its core rooted in the urban Cossacks of Western Siberia in the 17th century. By 1916, the Host's population had reached approximately 172,000 individuals, with a land ownership of approximately 5 million acres.\n\nThe February Revolution of 1917 further exacerbated class contradictions among the Cossacks. During the First Great Military Circle in Omsk in April 1917, two factions emerged: the \"Old Cossacks\", who sought to preserve their privileges and autonomy, and the \"New Cossacks\", who demanded the elimination of class distinctions. Despite these internal conflicts, the Old Cossacks emerged victorious.\n\nIn 1918, the Host was officially abolished. During the Civil War, Siberian Cossacks aligned with Admiral Kolchak's White forces. Kolchak, recognizing the importance of the \"Cossack oligarchy\", provided Cossack officers with significant promotions and the Cossack communities with financial and material support. However, this support could not contain the rising tensions and factionalism within the Host. Boris Annenkov, the [589.GetName] Butcher, declared himself the military ataman of the Siberian Cossack Host. However, his unilateral proclamation was met with resistance from many Cossacks, leading to open feuds. The infighting and warlordism further fragmented the Host.\n\nAfter the war, the new government of Russia, which was focused on post-war reconstruction, refused to reinstate the Siberian Cossack Host. This decision marked the end of the Host's existence, as the internal divisions and external pressures proved insurmountable."

alash.489.d: "In a significant step towards mutual support among emerging national states, the Ukrainian People's Republic has officially opened its diplomatic mission in [ALO.GetName]. In the north of [ALO.GetName] lies a vibrant Ukrainian community known as “Grey Ukraine” or “Grey Klyn”. This community was established by Ukrainian settlers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Seeking new opportunities and fertile lands, these settlers brought with them a rich cultural heritage, including their language, traditions, and agricultural practices. Over time, Grey Ukraine developed into a significant and influential enclave, now centered around the [590.GetName] Ukrainian Rada, led by Chairman V. Nagirnyi.\n\nFollowing the overthrow of the Hetmanate of Pavlo Skoropadskyi, the new government wished to expand its foreign influence, particularly towards the Ukrainian diaspora in Grey Klyn. The opening ceremony, held in [ALO.Capital.GetName], was attended by prominent figures from both governments. Representatives from the UPR, including their appointed ambassador, along with V. Nagirnyi and Minister-President [ALO.GetLeader], were present. The Ukrainians in Grey Ukraine are now truly a living bridge between the countries, and the representatives hoped that they will work tirelessly to ensure the prosperity of diaspora and the strengthening of bonds between the countries."

This decision comes in response to the [ALO.GetAdjective] government's controversial policies regarding the requisition of land from Russian and Ukrainian settlers, which have sparked significant unrest and dissatisfaction within the Ukrainian community in Grey Ukraine.\n\n[UKR.GetNameDefCap], having closely monitored the situation, expressed growing concern over the treatment of Ukrainian settlers. Despite efforts to engage in diplomatic dialogue and seek a compromise, the [ALO.GetAdjective] government's steadfast commitment to its land requisition policies left little room for negotiation.

alash.487.t: "The Return of Qajymuqan"
alash.487.d: "There are rumors about the legendary Qazaq wrestler Qajymuqan, actively spreading in the auls of [ROOT.GetName]. Qajymuqan was once world famous, but now he is known for his active support of the Üsh-Jüz party, and, if the latest gossip is to be believed, he makes a spectacle of it.\n\nThe latest story, which becomes wilder with every retelling, comes from [402.GetName] Vilayat. Allegedly Qajymuqan, with a red flag on his shoulders, like a hero of \"Bolshevik folklore propaganda\", challenged a local supporter of the [alash_487_alash] party and immediately defeated him in a wrestling match. According to rumors, when the dust settled and the unfortunate [alash_487_alash] supporter rose to his feet, Qajymuqan stood at full height and declared that only the Üsh-Jüz party could overthrow the domination of the [alash_487_alash] bais and intellectuals, who, according to him, were indifferent to the fate of ordinary Qazaqs.\n\nThe image of Qajymuqan, already far from young, stepping into the wrestling ring again, evokes both admiration and awe among ordinary Qazaqs. Despite his age and official retirement from active wrestling, he continues to remain in the spotlight, organizing wrestling championships throughout Alash Orda since 1920. His return to the ring, even if only in the colorful imagination of the villagers, sparked a new wave of respect and interest in the Üsh-Jüz Party.\n\nWhether the incident was real or just a fanciful story told around the campfire by young jigits, Qajymuqan's unique personality, combined with his unabashed political statements, made him a folk hero of sorts. The ridiculousness of turning an elderly wrestler into a political champion, red flag and all, only increased his mystique. In the auls, more and more new stories are told each time. According to one version, Qajymuqan defeated a whole group of [alash_487_alash] supporters at once; according to another, he lifted a yurt from the ground to prove his point."

alash.486.d: " was born into the family of Alikhan Beyokeikhan, under the name of Zeinep, the revered first minister-president of Alash-Orda and a national hero, and his wife Elena Sevostyanova. Yelizaveta's early years were marked by a strenuous education. From 1918 to the spring of 1920, she attended the Russian women's gymnasium in Alash-Qala, excelled in her studies, and received a recommendation from the Russian government to attend university. There, in the fall of 1920, she began her medical studies at Tomsk University and completed them in 1922.\n\nHer path crossed with that of Smagul Säduaqasov in 1924, a meeting that united two of the most influential families in [GetAdjective] politics. Their marriage symbolized a powerful alliance that combined the Bokeykhan's heritage with Säduaqasov's growing political influence. After her marriage, Yelizaveta continued her academic career in Tashkent. There she graduated from the medical faculty of Turkestan State University in 1927, earning a medical degree and beginning her career as a physician. The family returned to [ROOT.GetName] soon afterwards.\n\nDespite close ties to the Alash party through his father-in-law, Smagul Säduaqasov pursued an independent political path. He founded the Jas Azamat party, positioning it as a supportive yet separate structure within the Parliament. Now, not only as the daughter of the First Minister-President, but also as the wife of the incumbent one, Yelizaveta became an example to many Qazaq women. Her medical background and dedication to public health provide a valuable perspective in her husband's administration, influencing policies and initiatives to improve the well-being of the Qazaqs. She focuses on improving healthcare services across [ROOT.GetName], particularly in rural areas where medical services are scarce. Furthermore, Yelizaveta works to increase female enrollment in schools and universities."

alash.485.t: "The Gold Rush"
alash.485.d: "By the end of the 19th century, [404.GetName] was experiencing a period of intense economic growth, driven by a gold rush that transformed the city into a thriving hub. The city and its surrounding areas saw a significant increase in gold mining operations, with the region being dubbed the "future California of Russia". Between 1894 and 1900, 132 active mines extracted over 200 pounds of gold, making it a significant center for the gold industry in the ore-rich regions of Altai. This rush attracted not only local miners but also foreign investors, notably the British, who poured capital into the burgeoning industry.\n\nDespite the wealth generated, the gold rush brought its share of peril and tragedy. In the summer of 1896, an incident at the Menovshchikov and Khotimsky mines resulted in the unfortunate demise of eleven miners. Despite this setback, the allure of gold remained unabated.\n\nWith the establishment of Alash Orda, the gold industry in [404.GetName] entered a new phase. The Alash government recognized the economic potential of the region's gold reserves and sought to maximize the industry's benefits for the nation. However, the majority of [404.GetName]'s gold was transfered to the central government, which in our case, was not in [810.GetName], but [195.GetName]. With the new period of [ROOT.GetAdjective] independence, much of the gold was once again pouring into our own coffers, making our nation wealthier and more stable. The government hopes that the gold mining industry will continue to thrive, bringing much awaited prosperity and possibilities to improve the life of a common Qazaq man."

alash.484.t: "Ablai Khan's Residence"
alash.484.d: "Central to the period of the accession of the Qazaq Juzes to the Russian Empire was the construction of the fortress of St. Peter in 1752, located on the high coast of the Ishim River. This fortress served as the central outpost of the Presnogorkovo line of military fortifications and facilitated the establishment of political, trade, and economic relations between the Russian administration and the Khan's government.\n\nRecognizing the need for a dedicated space to address issues arising from the increasing frequency of Cossack raids, cattle thefts, and land disputes, Ablai Khan requested the construction of a residence near the fortress. In 1765, a wooden house was built for him in the Yengistau Mountains, up the Ishim River, just 2-3 kilometers from the fortress. This house served not only as a place of stay for Ablai Khan but also as a venue for resolving conflicts and conducting diplomatic affairs. Over time, the exact location and fate of Ablai Khan's residence became a matter of speculation. It is now reliably known that the wooden structure likely burned down in a fire and was replaced by a stone building in 1829. This building, situated within the city limits of Petropavlovsk since the second half of the 19th century, has served various purposes, including as a military infirmary during Tsarist times. Despite its abandonment in recent years, many locals continue to believe in its historical significance as the residence of the Great Khan.\n\nWith the restoration of the monarchy, there is a growing sentiment to honor the legacy of Ablai Khan. The government proposes to reclaim the stone building and refurbish it as the new residence for Khan [ROOT.GetLeader]."

alash.483.d: "On July 22th, 1905, a group of representatives from the national elite, who would later align with Alash movement, organized a petition on behalf of the Qazaq people. This document, addressed to Emperor Nicholas II and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers Witte, came to be known as the \"Qarqaraly Petition\". The Qarqaraly Petition articulated the grievances and aspirations of the Qazaq steppes. The petition highlighted several key issues: the imposition of the \"Steppe Regulations\" without regard for the population's needs, bureaucratic overreach and administrative disregard for laws and the spiritual and economic interests of the Kazakh people, and the artificially maintained ignorance of the masses. The key demands of the petition included freedom of conscience, education in the native language, abandonment of the resettlement policy, legislative ownership of land by the indigenous population, revision of the \"Steppe Regulations\" and administrative management, legal proceedings in Qazaq language, reduction of officials in the colonial apparatus, local representation in the supreme bodies of power. The petition received overwhelming support, with more than 14 thousand signatories, and spurred further political activity, including the formation of local constitutional democratic party (Kadets) organizations and subsequent congresses in [406.GetName] and [810.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThe current administration views this historical event as a cornerstone of the Qazaq struggle for independence and self-determination. By commemorating the Qarqaraly Petition, the government aims to honor the legacy of those who paved the way for today's sovereignty and to inspire continued vigilance in safeguarding national interests."

alash.482.t: "\"Bremen Musicians\" in the Steppes"
alash.482.d: "In the mid-19th century, the Qazaq steppe was graced by the presence of a legendary figure from a distant foreign land. This visitor, known for his remarkable skills and profound knowledge, left an indelible mark on the region. Qazaqs referred to him as Ulkyn-nemes (Big German) or Zor-muryn (Huge Nose). This man was none other than the renowned zoologist and author of the famous book \"Animal Life\", Alfred-Edmund Brehm. In 1875, Brehm embarked on a journey to Russia with fellow German scientist Otto Finsch. Supported by merchant-philanthropist Aleksandr Serebryakov, they decided to visit Siberia and Turkestan. Their travels took them from St. Petersburg to Moscow, then along the Volga to Kazan, Perm, Yekaterinburg, Tyumen, and finally to Omsk and Semipalatinsk.\n\nUpon their arrival in Semipalatinsk, Governor Vladimir Poltoratsky organized an argali hunt for the guests. Brehm's superior marksmanship with his double-barreled shotgun impressed the local hunters, leading to a legendary status among the Qazaq people. His knowledge of the Quran also astounded the local mullahs and ulema, who often knew only the first Surah. Brehm's familiarity with Islam, gained during his travels, allowed him to recite many Surahs by heart.\n\nBrehm and Finsch's journey through the Qazaq steppe was marked by remarkable encounters and observations. They explored the Arcata Mountains, lakes Sasykkol and Alakol, the Dzungarian Alatau, and the Aganakty gorge. They marveled at the vibrant wildlife, the majestic mountains, and the rich cultural heritage of the region. Brehm recorded Qazaq songs and legends, translating steppe rhapsodies and reading \"Faust\" to the nomads who listened with rapt attention. The Qazaqs, intrigued by the German visitors, created oral traditions about Brehm and Finsch. Finsch's love for piano music even led to the delivery of a grand piano to their bivouac, astonishing the local akyns.\n\nAfter returning to Germany, Brehm and Finsch published \"A Journey to Western Siberia in 1876\", providing an accurate and insightful account of their travels. Brehm and Finsch highlighted the Qazaqs' courtesy, hospitality, and the unique cultural and natural richness of their homeland."
alash.482.a: "It would be more accurate to say \"Brehmen musicians\"."

alash.481.t: "Bolshevik Khanate"
alash.481.d: "In the first months of 1918, a pro-Bolshevik Qazaq Khanate was formed among the vast steppes of the Atbasar region of [590.GetName] region, uniting several volosts under its banner. This khanate, which existed at least until early 1919, was a vivid manifestation of the complex interaction between traditional Qazaq governance and the revolutionary fervor that swept the region.\n\nThe Omsk Kadet newspaper \"Sibirskaya Rech\" wrote about this khanate in 1919, singling out the intriguing figure of Hassen-Hoj-Bek-Hodjin. An influential Qazaq of the Atbasar district and a candidate to the Constituent Assembly from the Üsh-Jüz party, Hassen-Hoj-Bek-Hodjin failed to occupy a prominent position in Alash-Orda. According to the newspaper, he was sent by the Omsk sovdep to agitate in the steppes and unite the Qazaqs of the Atbasar district under the banner of "the most holy sovdepiya", as he called it. Realizing that the term \"khanate\" resonated with the Qazaqs, he declared his association a khanate and proclaimed himself khan.\n\nHowever, this bold move was short-lived. The newspaper reported that the first khan was eventually deposed and replaced by a more powerful and wealthy leader. Even now, the Üsh-Jüz party remains open to the concept of khanate, demonstrating the still-unfounded ideological underpinnings of its movement."
alash.481.a: "Well, that's ridiculous!"

alash.480.t: "The Scourge of Jut and Famine"
alash.480.d: "In the harsh and unforgiving winters of the Qazaq land, the phenomenon known as "jut" has repeatedly caused significant disruption, leading to the mass death of livestock and triggering devastating famines. The phenomenon of jut, defined as the mass starvation of animals resulting from extreme weather conditions and inadequate fodder, has persisted in the region for generations. A sudden frost, followed by precipitation and a blizzard, could result in the formation of a layer of ice that would prevent cattle from grazing, thereby causing them to perish without adequate hay and feed.\n\nHowever, the causes of jut extend beyond natural disasters to include the misguided policies of the ruling authorities. Local wisdom captures the severity of jut with sayings like, \"Jut is already seven troubles\" and \"Jut has seven relatives\", which collectively refer to the associated calamities of drought, fire, epidemic, mudslide, earthquake, and blizzard. Each episode of jut was given its own designation, frequently named after the Eastern calendar. Notable instances include the jut of the year of the leopard in 1903, the year of the dragon in 1917, and the year of the horse in 1919. The consequences were often catastrophic, resulting in the loss of livestock for wealthy herders, the destruction of gardens and vegetable plots, and the migration of destitute individuals in search of survival. These events were frequently accompanied by famine and outbreaks of contagious diseases.\n\nThe 1921-1922 famine had a significant impact on Western Steppe, affecting several provinces, including [1208.GetName], [402.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_7370], [406.GetName], [583.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_10284], and [1224.GetName]. In contrast to previous famines, the latter was not precipitated by adverse climatic conditions but rather by the economic collapse that followed the Civil War and the emergence of banditry. The one-sided policies of the Bolsheviks served to exacerbate the situation. By 1921, famine had engulfed more than one million square kilometers of land across five provinces, with approximately two million people experiencing starvation. In response to the crisis, the Russian government, in collaboration with the Alash Orda administration, implemented measures to alleviate the situation. These included the exemption of the nomadic and semi-nomadic Qazaq population from taxes on meat, leather, wool, and oil. Sanitary commissions were established with the objective of preventing the spread of infectious diseases and providing support to the affected population. In order to combat hunger, a number of initiatives were implemented, including the restoration of rural cooperatives, the repatriation of Qazaq peasants, and the provision of agricultural equipment and seed funds. The Alash figures played a pivotal role in these endeavors, exerting immense effort to alleviate the suffering. The American Relief Administration (ARA) was especially commendable, providing crucial assistance in the form of food, medicine, and clothing.\n\nThe famine's aftermath left a profound demographic and economic impact on the republic. The population suffered significant losses, agricultural productivity declined significantly, and the spread of infectious diseases highlighted the inadequacies of the healthcare system."
alash.480.a: "We must make every effort to make sure it doesn't happen again."

alash.479.t: "The Last Stand of the Mountain Eagles"
alash.479.d: "In the chaotic years of 1918-1919, amidst the chaos of the Russian Civil War, a detachment known as the \"Mountain Eagles\" emerged in the Tarbagatai mountains. In the aftermath of the October Revolution, the Soviets briefly established control in Urjar village. However, they were swiftly overthrown by Cossacks, wealthy settlers, and local bais. As a result of the imprisonment of village council activists in [404.GetName], the Reds dispatched a detachment, which prompted the Cossacks to flee to China. Following the fall of Sergiopol, the White forces advanced, pushing through villages situated to the west of Urjar. The Urjar detachment subsequently disintegrated. Some retreated to Cherkassk, while others dispersed into the surrounding villages. Eighteen individuals, however, took to the Tarbagatai Mountains to form a partisan group. As villages began to surrender Bolshevik forces to the Whites, the Mountain Eagles, led by partisans such as Illarion Lukin, resorted to acts of terror in order to halt this betrayal. In December 1918, the Mountain Eagles executed the foreman of Aksakovka for his brutal treatment of Bolshevik families and subsequent betrayals. This act of retribution was repeated in Petrovsky, which resulted in wealthy peasants fully aligning with the Whites.\n\nBy the beginning of 1919, forces under the command of Ataman Annenkov had entered Semirechye and subsequently turned their attention to the Mountain Eagles. Annenkov, who had previously been allied with Lukin and Alekseev, extended offers of freedom and life in exchange for their surrender. The partisans' refused to abandon their position. Meanwhile, Garbuzov, an officer under Annenkov, spearheaded a campaign of arson and looting across three villages. Petrovsky, Pyatiyarsky, and Podgornoye. The massacres resulted in numerous fatalities. In April 1919, disparate partisan groups unified into five squadrons, initiating attacks on White forces and seizing supplies. Despite their best efforts, the September assault on Sergiopol was unsuccessful and resulted in the death of their leader. By November, Annenkov's troops had successfully isolated the partisan forces in the mountainous region. In a final assembly, the Mountain Eagles resolved to continue the struggle until the end, even if it meant retreating deeper into the mountains. The ultimate fate of the Mountain Eagles remains shrouded in mystery. Some believe the harsh weather and typhus claimed their lives, others that they were massacred by Annenkov's forces, and some hold that they escaped to Xinjiang. As the Russian Civil War drew to a close, the White Army reasserted control over the Steppe, leaving the legend of the Mountain Eagles a poignant chapter in the struggle for the Qazaq land."
alash.479.a: "We must perpetuate the memory of these heroes!"
alash.479.b: "Annenkov is a murderer, as are Lukin and Alekseev - you can't expect any good from Russians."

alash.391.d: "We have received reports that the command of [RVA.GetName] has fled the city of [217.GetName] after the battle for the city was lost. With the city falling under the control of [RUS.GetNameDef], it became clear that [RVA.GetLeader] will lose the war.

alash.394.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Guarantees of Autonomy"
alash.394.d: "With the change of leadership, Kyrgyz fears about the fate of their autonomy increased. Despite the opportunity, they have remained loyal to Russia, and perhaps we should thank them for that. We do not need to open another front, but we should keep in mind the sentiments at home."
alash.394.a: "Provide clear safeguards."

alash.397.t: "Russia Restores Military Control Over Us!"
alash.397.d: "The Russian troops have now crossed the borders without declaration of war. As masters of these lands, they peacefully restored control over the Orenburg-Tashkent railway, their bases and city centers. Our government has not even received any notification from the Russian government on their actions, but it all makes sense: the Russian army has returned, after the chaos of Kerensky's assassination, to restore control over their southern borders."
alash.397.a: "But... we thought we were independent..."

alash.399.t: "Russian Influence Shrinks!"
alash.399.d: "With Russia slowly emerging into chaos, its influence over our country becomes really nominal, if not less. While we are still not ready to declare full independence, as this implies risks of being declared war on, the government suggests to use these terrible times in our own favour."

alash.398.t: "Influence Over Alash Autonomy Shrinks!"
alash.398.d: "With our country shlowly descending into chaos, we had to withdraw some of our troops from Alash Autonomy, meaning that despite they are still our federal subject, we cannot be completely sure they are fully committed to us. The time will tell if they will become fully independent, but at least me must be ready for another stab in the back from untrustworthy Kirgizs!"
alash.398.a: "There's nothing we can do..."

alash.400.t: "Independence At Last!"
alash.400.d: "The majority of our ministers claim that the time has come to throw off the chains of Russian oppression and end the farce of Alash Orda being part of Russia, despite ethnic Russians and Cossacks believe that there will be no Qazaq state without Russian assistance."

alash.51.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"

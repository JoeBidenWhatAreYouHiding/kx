YAK_In_The_Lands_Of_Permafrost:0 "In The Lands Of Permafrost"
YAK_In_The_Lands_Of_Permafrost_desc:0 "In the lands of permafrost, where the winds ceaselessly howl and bite like circling wolves and where the snow and ice never melts - in the land of pure, endless white that strips flesh from bone with its frozen fangs, we the Yakuts, or Sakha, have carved out an existence where all others do not dare to settle. Though life is brutal in this near-wasteland, we have survived here for centuries, and now we must defend these long-held lands from Southern devils who seek to subjugate our people for their own twisted ambitions. We shall defend this frozen tundra we call home to the last man, woman, and child, for these snow-blasted plains are our homelands, and we shall never be torn from this land so long as you can still see the warm breath escaping our mouths."

YAK_Block_The_Southern_Tract:0 "Block the Southern Tract"
YAK_Block_The_Southern_Tract_desc:0 "There exists only two routes into the heartlands of our territory, and we must defend these crossings at all costs. By sealing the Southern Tract with a purposely caused avalanche, we could seal off that pass for an entire season or longer. This shall force our foes to cross through barren and inhospitable wilderness to reach our citizens, allowing the wrath of Winter to begin drawing blood before their soldiers even reach our firing arcs."

YAK_Block_The_Eastern_Tract:0 "Block the Eastern Tract"
YAK_Block_The_Eastern_Tract_desc:0 "With our homeland being so isolated out here in the depths of Siberia, travel to and within our territory has always been difficult. Only two direct routes exist that offer clear and safe passage into the lands of the Yakuts, and we shall seal these passes to slow any advancing force. The Eastern Tract holds the major railway that drives into our newly independent nation, and so we must temporarily destroy parts of this track to halt any enemy forces seeking to quickly enter our lands. Tracks can always be rebuilt, but the lives lost to the coming war can not be, so every life we save is precious and every second of delay we buy is paramount to our survival as we wait for the Winter’s bite to soften up the approaching enemy."

YAK_Empty_The_Warehouses:0 "Empty the Warehouses"
YAK_Empty_The_Warehouses_desc:0 "Across Yakutia, there exists a disconnected network of old armories, weapons caches, and surplus warehouses that the Russian government built out here during the time of the Russian Civil War. In these small outposts, the Russians stashed away literal tons of military equipment that, despite being outdated and very, very cold, are still mostly in working order and thus useful for our fight for independence. We must raid these long-abandoned depots and scavenge all we can find, for every Yakut will need to be armed to push back the Southern Menace."

YAK_Raise_The_Local_Militia:0 "Raise the Local Militia"
YAK_Raise_The_Local_Militia_desc:0 "The Yakuts have a long history of maintaining local militias, with many even serving our former Russian masters in the Russian Civil War. We must tap into this innate martial tradition and rouse the militias to fight for their people once more. We shall need ever able bodied soldiers our villages can muster, for we are outnumbered and outgunned. Only with their expertise and knowledge of these frozen lands do we have any hope of earning our independence."

YAK_Establishing_Border_Control:0 "Establishing Border Control"
YAK_Establishing_Border_Control_desc:0 "With the only two direct routes into our lands now thoroughly secured, we must expand this vigilance to the rest of our borders. Stealthy patrols shall stalk the snows for our foes and checkpoints, barricades, and hidden outposts shall be built enmasse to dot the nation with border protections, creating an early-warning system ready and waiting to give the call that our enemies are mobilizing on the borders once again. We shall be prepared, and none shall enter our borders without us knowing about it so that we may strike quickly and quietly to keep Yakutia safe."

YAK_The_Ice_Melted:0 "The Ice has Melted"
YAK_The_Ice_Melted_desc:0 "Though our region still lies as frozen as ever, a thaw of sorts has begun in the lands of the Yakuts. Our independence, against all odds, has been won, and for the first time in centuries our people breathe free air, free from the musk of fear and oppression  that has long pervaded. We now stand free and sovereign, ready to take on the world and establish ourselves as a new and modern nation out here at the World’s end. We have freed ourselves from this icy prison, and now a new Spring is dawning in Yakutia, heralding the arrival of our new and bright destiny."

YAK_Revive_Army:0 "Revive Yakut People's Army"
YAK_Revive_Army_desc:0 "The Yakut People’s Army was a small force under the command of White General Mikhail Korobeinikov who triumphantly fought the Reds in the waning months of the Russian Civil War. Though long since disbanded, the memory of these brave Yakut heroes and their ferocity in the face of a mightier foe is commendable and an example our new armed forces should follow. We shall recreate this YPA and solidify it as the national army of our newly independent state. Under the banner of the Yakut People’s Army, our new homeland shall be safe and sovereign forevermore."

YAK_Smuggle_Foreign_Equipment:0 "Smuggle Foreign Equipment"
YAK_Smuggle_Foreign_Equipment_desc:0 "Living out in Siberia has its advantages, but the level of industrialization is not one of them. We lack some of the most basic manufacturing capabilities when it comes to producing weapons of war, so we must import whatever weaponry we can manage to purchase off international sellers while we also scavenge the carcass of the dying Russian state to find any and all weapons we can find. As long as it still shoots or is able to kill or maim, it shall find a use in our army."

YAK_Mobilize_Yakuts:0 "Mobilize Yakuts"
YAK_Mobilize_Yakuts_desc:0 "We must mobilize our main population if we are to survive the rigors of the modern world. Every able-bodied Yakut man shall be taught how to shoot as well as the basics of military combat and warfare. At a moment’s notice, we could be invaded once more, so our entire population needs to be ready for this likely inevitability. Through sheer manpower and through mastery of this Winter Wasteland, we shall overcome our foes."

YAK_Save_Our_People:0 "Save Our People"
YAK_Save_Our_People_desc:0 "We must save our people, and the only way to truly do that is through steel. Weapons and machines of war must be produced, new guns and artillery created, and more soldiers trained and deployed. Only through readiness for war can we truly be saved, for war is an eternal and harsh fact of life, and the only way to truly ready ourselves is to ensure we have more guns than we know what to do with."

YAK_Conscript_Minorities:0 "Conscript Minorities"
YAK_Conscript_Minorities_desc:0 "Siberia is a vast land that hosts a vast array of varied peoples. Within our own borders, minority communities dot the landscape, consisting of native peoples like the Evens, Evenks, Tatars, Buryats, Kyrgz, Chukchis, and Dolgans, as well as a large Russian subpopulation and even a decent amount of Ukranians and Czechs who settled here after the RCW. We should reach out to these minority groups and conscript them into our militias so that we may better bolster the Yakutian wave, for we cannot afford to let nearly half our population sit idly by as we Yakuts fight for survival and sovereignty."

YAK_Fighting_In_Permafrost:0 "Fighting In Permafrost"
YAK_Fighting_In_Permafrost_desc:0 "The frozen wastes of Siberia - this eternal land of permafrost - is one of the harshest settled regions on Earth. Despite blistering winds and bone-chilling cold, our people have carved out a culture and a history here in this icy hell. Our people know these lands and this climate like no others. We must tap into this innate knowledge and showcase it in all of our military strategy. We are the people of the permafrost, and we shall show our enemies what this name means as we dye the pure white snow red with their blood."

YAK_Nomad_Legacy:0 "Nomad Legacy"
YAK_Nomad_Legacy_desc:0 "We Sakha, or Yakuts, are a Turkic peoples - born from the true Sons of the Steppe who migrated here long ago on their great conquests and crusades. We are their kin, and as such their nomadic martial legacy burns like a raging fire inside us, rallying us forward to ever greater military excellence. Horse rearing and riding is in our blood, for these beasts come from these plains themselves. This nomadic legacy shall become a pillar of our military might, for the honor and victories of our ancestors shall only inspire us to higher levels of greatness."

YAK_Partisan_Warfare:0 "Partisan Warfare"
YAK_Partisan_Warfare_desc:0 "No matter how prepared our doctrines and our soldiers seem, there is no denying we likely shall always face larger and more daunting foes. Meeting these enemies of Yakutia on the open and fair battlefield would spell doom for our people and our newly gained independence. Partisan tactics, guerilla strategies, and asymmetrical warfare is our only true path to survival. We shall use the land and the Winter as our allies and strike any foe foolish enough to invade our frozen lands repeatedly and without reprieve. They will not be allowed to rest, they will not be shown mercy, and they shall know only fear, for we shall be the haunters and spectres of this frozen hell - may all fear the True North."

YAK_Secure_Our_Independence:0 "Secure Our Independence"
YAK_Secure_Our_Independence_desc:0 "For the first time in centuries, the Yakut people march to the beat of their own war drums, for we are no longer the subjects of foreigners and Southerners. We are the one, true masters of this frozen Eden we call home, and we shall defend it at all costs. Our sovereignty, our independence, our right to dictate our own futures - all these rights these foreign dogs have tried to take from us. This injustice ends now, for we are the people of Yakutia, and we shall fight for the right to live as we choose, or we shall die trying. The era of Yakut oppression at the hands of the Russians is at an end, so let us give rise to the new age of this icy North."

YAK_First_Yakut_Elections:0 "First Yakut Elections"
YAK_First_Yakut_Elections_desc:0 "Through sheer will and bravery, we have secured our independence. Finally, the people of Yakutia have earned the right to determine their own destiny, and that is exactly what we have now progressed towards together as a newly free people. Soon, we shall hold the first Yakutian elections, allowing our fair people to dictate the path their new government shall take. Though some in the nation are uneasy about throwing our fate to the wolves, so to speak, the majority of our provisional government feels it is now time for our people to make the choice for themselves. So, let us rejoice, and welcome our new future as the vote counting finally begins."

YAK_Confederalist_Victory:0 "Confederalist Victory"
YAK_Confederalist_Victory_desc:0 "In a surprise steal, the Confederalist party led by Pavel Ksenofontov has won the first Yakutian elections. A known populist and avowed republican with a known sympathy towards Socialism and other Left Wing policies, Pavel and his party are expected to push for a confederation of the local minorities with the Yakuts while drastically liberalize the nation as he pursues less radical, more palatable Socialist policies within our traditionally conservative society - ever staying wary of our people’s natural aversion to Socialism following the Reds’ cruelty during the Russian Civil War."

YAK_Federalist_Victory:0 "Federalist Victory"
YAK_Federalist_Victory_desc:0 "Winning over much of the urban and educated liberal population within Yakutia, Gavriil Ksenofontov and his Federalist party has won the first Yakutian elections. A famous ethnographer and historian know for documenting the various peoples of Eastern Siberia, Gavriil is expected to push heavily for new educational and economic reform as he seeks to establish a new federalist system here in Yakutia linking together the various regions and ethnicities that make up our diverse republic."

YAK_Conservative_Victory:0 "Union of Sakha Victory"
YAK_Conservative_Victory_desc:0 "In a victory that has come at a surprise to no one, Kyulyumnuur’s Union of Sakha has won the day in our recent inaugural elections. Riding the conservative Yakutian majority to victory, Kyulyumnuur is expected to continue the long-held atmosphere of Yakutian primacy as he and his allies work to create a truly modern, profitable, and uniquely Yakut republic."

YAK_Nationalist_Victory:0 "Sakah D'ono Victory"
YAK_Nationalist_Victory_desc:0 "Platon Oyunsky, also known as Platon Alekseevich Slepstov or the ‘Ytaachy’ as his follower call him, has somehow secured a victory in our first national elections, shocking the nation. A prolific author and notable father to modern Yakutian nationalism, Oyunsky - once a pen name he has since completely adopted - now seeks to strip away all in Yakutia that is simply not wholly Yakut in nature in an effort to preserve our unique heritage from outside influences. Under his leadership, Yakutia shall embrace the ways of our ancestors and truly become a purely Yakut state."

YAK_Create_Peasant_Councils:0 "Create Peasant Councils"
YAK_Create_Peasant_Councils_desc:0 "In an effort to bring together the various peoples of Yakutia and introduce them to soft Socialist reforms, we shall create a series of peasant councils. These assemblies shall allow our citizens to organize amongst themselves and better protect themselves against the predatory nature of capitalism while pooling together their resources to better represent themselves and their local communities in the wider government."

YAK_Giving_Autonomy_To_Evenks:0 "Give Autonomy to Evenks"
YAK_Giving_Autonomy_To_Evenks_desc:0 "The Evenks are the single largest native minority group within our borders, dwarfed only by the populations of the Yakuts and the large Russian minority. We must grant autonomy to these groups so as to curry more favor with their leaders and representatives, easing relations within our government as we better integrate the Evenks into our society - without consuming their unique identity of course."

YAK_Progressive_Taxation:0 "Progressive Taxation"
YAK_Progressive_Taxation_desc:0 "Like in many societies, much of the wealth in Yakutia has pooled around the upper echelons of society, while the lowest classes writhe in poverty. Despite this dichotomy, the tax rate in our nation is largely flat. We must rectify this egregious oversight of economic liberty and introduce a graduated progressive tax. Those at the top must pay more than those at the bottom, for that is only fair."

YAK_First_Yakut_Constitution:0 "First Yakut Constitution"
YAK_First_Yakut_Constitution_desc:0 "To fully cement the new liberties, rights, freedoms, and laws we have passed since the creation of our young republic, we have decided to go forward and pen a new constitution of the Yakutian Republic. This document shall enshrine these privileges and restraints into national law, setting the bedrock of this republic so that future generations may build off it and improve it as time goes on."

YAK_Start_Vseobuch:0 "Start the Vseobuch"
YAK_Start_Vseobuch_desc:0 "The Vseobuch, meaning Universal Education, is a proposed mass educational reform that will completely rebuild the educational system in Yakutia from the ground up, modernizing it and rebuilding it along Western lines. Every child in Yakutia shall receive a public, secular education using state-mandated, Western-influenced curriculum, educating our next generation properly like none has before it. With this education, they shall be ready for the modern world they are inheriting."

YAK_Seek_Foreign_Investment:0 "Seek Foreign Investment"
YAK_Seek_Foreign_Investment_desc:0 "We live in a virtual icebox, and our economy shows it. Without foreign capital flowing into our economy, warming it enough to thaw the great icy grip our isolation has wrought, our attempts at nation building and modernization are as good as dead. We must reach out to foreign financiers to melt the frozen barriers that stall our economic transformation."

YAK_Begin_The_Reforms:0 "Begin the Reforms"
YAK_Begin_The_Reforms_desc:0 "With the foundations of their rule established, the ruling party under [YAK.GetLeader] is set to begin the bulk of their planned reforms that shall transform Yakutia into a new state - one poised to take on the struggles and tribulations of modernity. Yakutia will never be the same, and all shall be changed in our wake, for the metamorphosis of Yakutian society is about to begin."

YAK_Legitimizing_Local_Customs:0 "Legitimize Local Customs"
YAK_Legitimizing_Local_Customs_desc:0 "The various local beliefs and cultures, whether they be shamanistic, druidistic, primalist, tribalist, or any other more archaic form of identity, are all inherent parts of our national identity. This mix of diverse backgrounds and histories is what has formed the modern Yakutian identity. We must legitimize and legalize all of these cultures, for each one is integral to our newly minted nation."

YAK_Follow_The_Yytaachy:0 "Follow the Yytaachy"
YAK_Follow_The_Yytaachy_desc:0 "Praise the Yytaachy, the great Guide, Oyunsky, for he shall deliver the Yakut people to deliverance and prosperity. As the Guide of our nation and the father of our cultural rebirth, he is the one true leader for us all. We must bend to his will and follow his every command, for he who communes with the gods is the highest among us all. Praise the Yytaachy, praise Yakutia!"

YAK_Preserve_Yakut_Culture:0 "Preserve Yakut Culture"
YAK_Preserve_Yakut_Culture_desc:0 "Yakut culture is the greatest culture in the land! We are the greatest of all Siberians and of all Turkic peoples. We are the descendants of great conquerors and the children of the Aiy, our noble and primordial gods. Our culture and our way of life must be preserved and spread at all costs, for all in our borders shall be made to embrace Yakut culture or be rejected by it."

YAK_Assimilate_Evenks:0 "Assimilate Evenks"
YAK_Assimilate_Evenks_desc:0 "The Evenks, though distinct culturally and genetically, are our Turkic kin. They and their similar tribes like the Evens and the Dolgans are our brothers and sisters in all senses of the words. We must assimilate them into the one true Yakutian culture, erasing away their minor differences and deviations from our righteous path. Together, we shall make Yakutia great, and those that oppose us and this move shall be eradicated, for only traitors and fools would deny our righteousness."

YAK_Praise_The_Aiy:0 "Praise the Aiy"
YAK_Praise_The_Aiy_desc:0 "The Aiy, our primordial deities and ancestral gods, must be obeyed and praised at all times. Without these great beings, both we and the world would not exist, for all of time and creation is at their whim. Only the Yytaachy can commune with these great ones, and so we shall follow his word and give praise to our gods. Only then, will fortune and prosperity smile down upon us - the chosen few, the Yakuts."

YAK_Cooperation_With_Russians:0 "Friends in Petrograd?"
YAK_Cooperation_With_Russians_desc:0 "Despite past grievances, Russia is our natural ally. We have a long history of cooperation, their people make up more than a quarter of our population, and they are right on our doorstep. We should reach out and strike an accord before their tanks and riflemen start to march over the border."

YAK_Look_Towards_Siberia:0 "Look Towards Siberia"
YAK_Look_Towards_Siberia_desc:0 "Siberia is our natural ally, for we are both newly independent states seeking to throw off the shackles of imperialism and foreign rule. Together, we shall rule this frozen domain and put our own people first, before the greedy needs of the Southerners."

YAK_Armed_Neutrality:0 "Armed Neutrality"
YAK_Armed_Neutrality_desc:0 "We cannot trust a single soul outside our own borders, for all foreign powers circle our infantile state like wolves on the hunt. We must stand resolute and strong, protecting our independence and our neutrality with military might. Yakutia shall not become a slave to foreign entanglements and whims so soon after freeing ourselves from such nightmares."

YAK_Join_The_Brotherhood:0 "Join the Brotherhood"
YAK_Join_The_Brotherhood_desc:0 "Down South, along the Eastern Steppe, a new force rises. This meteoric force seeks to free Asia and all of its inhabitants from the yoke of foreign rule and perversions. We must ride with the Khan and this great movement, to free Asia and its peoples once and for all!"

YAK_Cooperation_With_Japanese:0 "Cooperation With the Japanese"
YAK_Cooperation_With_Japanese_desc:0 "The closest power to us that did not once also lord over our people, and the natural enemy to our former oppressors, Japan is clearly the ally for our newly independent state. Only by standing with Tokyo can we truly remain free and keep our culture alive, even if that means giving up a piece of our soul to the Eastern Hegemon."

YAK_Towards_Prosperous_Economy:0 "Towards A Prosperous Economy"
YAK_Towards_Prosperous_Economy_desc:0 "With our independence secured, we must work towards creating a truly prosperous, modern economy free from the entrapments of our imperialist past. Without a bustling economy, our new state shall wither and die before it can even draw first breath, and so the creation of a new financial system to support our infantile nation is a top priority."

YAK_Nationalization_Of_Resources:0 "Nationalization of Resources"
YAK_Nationalization_Of_Resources_desc:0 "In order to more efficiently utilize the resources of the state, all natural resources shall be nationalized under our ruling regime. From this centralized control apparatus, the economy of our nation shall be planned in advance until it is ready to run on its own two feet."

YAK_Money_For_Farmers:0 "Farming Subsidies"
YAK_Money_For_Farmers_desc:0 "The farmer is the lifeblood of Yakutia. These brave families till the frozen soil and turn permafrost into sustenance before our eyes. Without these knowledgeable herders and croppers, our people would surely starve. We must subsidize these groups and help them establish larger, more modernized farms to better feed our growing population."

YAK_Agriculture_In_Severe_Climate:0 "Agriculture in Severe Climate"
YAK_Agriculture_In_Severe_Climate_desc:0 "To farm in this frozen wasteland is no easy task. Only the southernmost reaches of our nation are habitable for crop farming while agriculture elsewhere in the nation is primarily livestock and reindeer herding. We must expand these sectors of food production, increasing the size of the Southern fields while expanding and fertilizing the grazing lands of the North. We are masters of feeding our people in these frozen plains, and we shall take this expertise into the modern age with us."

YAK_Modernized_Uraha:0 "Modernized Urasa"
YAK_Modernized_Uraha_desc:0 "The Urasa are a type of summer home traditionally built by the local tribes of Yakutia. Built like large, rounded cones similar to conical yurts but made out of more permanent materials. We shall begin a development scheme to build prefabricated Urasas around the nation out of wood and cement to provide permanent housing to our growing populations."

YAK_Develop_Merchantry:0 "Develop Merchantry"
YAK_Develop_Merchantry_desc:0 "A viable merchant class is necessary to create a prosperous and viable modern economy. We must enact favorable legislation to encourage entrepreneurialism within our population to create their own business, which in turn will slowly create a middle, mercantile class within our borders. On their backs, our economy shall grow."

YAK_Aldanzoloto:0 "Aldanzoloto"
YAK_Aldanzoloto_desc:0 "Aldanzolo is a massive mining conglomerate operating out here in Yakutia and first started by the Russians. With their absence, the ruins of this great monopoly now lie dormant and begging to be utilized. Primarily concerned with gold mining, we shall pick up where they left off and continue to extract this shimmering metal from the ground to finance our rapidly growing economy."

YAK_Begin_The_Industrialization:0 "Beginnings of Industrialization"
YAK_Begin_The_Industrialization_desc:0 "With the economy beginning to hum along and with enough capital to undertake such an endeavor now within our state’s coffers, the time has begun to industrialize the lands of permafrost. Factories shall rise from the ice and snow as we cloud the white and blue skies with the black smog of modernity and progress. The heat of these factories shall thaw the ice that binds us and carry us to our new future!"

YAK_Find_The_Blue_Clay:0 "Find the §CBlue Clay§!"
YAK_Find_The_Blue_Clay_desc:0 "Tales and legends dating back decades exist of shimmering rock being found rarely in the deep pits and fissures that dot our landscape. These deposits of near mythical §CBlue Clay§! have haunted the myths of tribals and Russian imperialists alike, alluring the greedy and the adventurous alike with the siren’s song of infinite wealth. In reality, this ‘§CBlue Clay§!’ is no mythical force or material, but diamond - tons and tons of the stuff lying underneath the volcanic plates of Siberia. We must follow the myths and rumors and find these springs of immeasurable wealth to further fund the Yakutian miracle."

YAK_Into_Modern_Age:0 "Into the Modern Age"
YAK_Into_Modern_Age_desc:0 "Our economy now hurls along like a well-fueled train, carrying our infantile state and our people towards a bright new age.

YAK_Socialist_Revolution_desc:0 "Raging against tradition and primalism, Maksim Ammosov and his band of Socialist revolutionaries have thrown off the yoke of Yakut supremacy and now charge forth into a bright, Red unknown.

YAK_From_Primalism_To_Socialism:0 "From Primalism to Socialism"
YAK_From_Primalism_To_Socialism_desc:0 "The past has done nothing but hold Yakutia and its peoples back, trapping us in the bonds of primalism, tribalism, superstition, and backwards fear caused by lack of understanding. We shall do away with these shackles and free our people with the egalitarian justice that only Socialism can bring. Under a Red Banner, Yakutia shall march out of the past and into its bright future - one illuminated by a Red Star."

YAK_Allow_Small_Traders:0 "Allow Small Traders"
YAK_Allow_Small_Traders_desc:0 "Though we are transitioning to a Socialist society, we are not fully ready to abandon all Capitalist principles. A small trading class shall be allowed to exist, serving as a connection to the outer world and its interconnected economy while also generating a small amount of economic mobility within our own borders, hopefully preventing stagnation."

YAK_Form_The_Sakha_Soviet:0 "Form the Sakha Soviet"
YAK_Form_The_Sakha_Soviet_desc:0 "A united people’s council is needed to serve as a forum for all peoples within our nation, so that each and every Yakutian can have their voice be heard. A grand, unified Sakha Soviet shall be erected to serve as the main representative body of our regime, based on the old systems of the failed Bolsheviks and updated to mesh better with our specific peoples. Through this assembly, every voice shall be heard and every concern or idea for the state and its functions noted. The time for true democracy and representation is finally upon us."

Do we belong with our other Socialist powers, should we be the heralds of a new world revolution, or should we simply just sit in the lands of permafrost and focus on ourselves above all others - these questions and more haunt our regime and sow division within our ranks.

With his claim as strong as any other candidates, especially given his proven experience in lording over an ice-swept wasteland, Smolin is likely the most suitable candidate.

### Events ###
yak.1.t:0 "Sakha Sire!"
yak.1.d:0 "For too long have we being oppressed by the Russian colonists, who brought their culture, taxes and diseases. We never received the autonomy we desired, and now, while Kolchak's country is slowly dissolving, we must proclaim our independence. The provisional government of VYaONU, consisting of Yakut Oblastniki has declared the independence of Sakha people."
yak.1.a:0 "Independence!"

yak.2.t:0 "The Yakut People's Army"
yak.2.d:0 "The Yakut people's Army, which was destroyed by the Russian troops and forgotten, must be revived. We need professional fighters who are ready to defend our country from the greatest threat."
yak.2.a:0 "The army will bring us safety"

yak.3.t:0 "Sending a Special Division to Yakutia?"
yak.3.d:0 "While we are dealing with internal chaos, the Yakuts have seceded, but they don't have any organized force to fight back. They can only use their landscape to fight us. Perhaps we shall send a division avoiding the main tracts and try to encircle them and capture Yakutsk.\n\nThere are two choices: Innokentiy Smolin, a talented general, who was born in Yakutsk and who knows well the area or Anatoliy Pepelyaev, our field marshal, who is definitely more experienced than Smolin and proved to be a good soldier."
yak.3.a:0 "Send there Smolin"
yak.3.b:0 "Send there Pepelyaev"
yak.3.c:0 "We don't see any reasons to send there our generals."


yak.4.t:0 "Siberian Army Division in Yakutia"
yak.4.d:0 "It seems that the [TRM.GetAdjective] government has sent a special division to our region, avoiding the Tracts, perhaps to encircle and crush us. Our partisans have already found the division, consisting of about 100 soldiers, though knowing their professionalism, the battle can be too costly for us. We can leave them alone, hoping they will die in the Yakutian Winter, or try to start a battle with them."
yak.4.a:0 "Not a single Siberian soldier in our territory!"
yak.4.b:0 "Don't waste our time on them - they will probably be dead by tomorrow."

yak.5.t:0 "The Siberian Army Captures Yakutsk!"
yak.5.d:0 "The Siberian Army Division has seized our capital city, leaving our border security without any supplies. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been arrested and now the Siberian Army demands we give up."
yak.5.a:0 "We shall fight back for our independence!"
yak.5.b:0 "We give up!"

yak.6.t:0 "Siberian Army Crushed!"
yak.6.d:0 "We have crushed the Siberian division and let them die in torment. Their leader has been arrested and taken into prison in Yakutsk. We sent an ultimatum to the Far-Eastern government that if they don't recognize our independence, their general will be executed."
yak.6.a:0 "A victory for Yakut People!"

yak.7.t:0 "The Siberian Division Lost in Snow"
yak.7.d:0 "We still have no reports on the Sibirian Division of Pepelyaev, it seems that there were lost in snow and dead now. This operation became another another failure of our regime and a loss of a talented general."
yak.7.a:0 "Rest in Peace, Anatoliy"

yak.8.t:0 "Yakutsk Battle Lost"
yak.8.d:0 "We lost the battle of Yakutsk and once again became just a colony of Russians. Innokentiy Smolin, proclaiming himself the Governor of Yakutia, has established military control over capital city. Even though there are still partisans, fighting for their freedom, it seems that the independence of Sakha people is doomed."
yak.8.a:0 "The End of Yakut Winter."

yak.9.t:0 "Governorate of Yakutia"
yak.9.d:0 "The division of Smolin has successfully seized control over Yakutia, destroying the opposition to our regime."
yak.9.a:0 "That is great!"

yak.10.t:0 "Yakut Spring"
yak.10.d:0 "The ice melted and now we are a totally independent state. The border control at the Yakutian Tracts has been established and now we don't allow anybody enter or leave our country. Of course, this measures are temporarily, until we finally realize that the Russians respect our sovereignity. It is time to hold the first elections and decide on our national flag."
yak.10.a:0 "Yakut people are strong."

yak.11.t:0 "Yakut Soldiers Raise the White Flag"
yak.11.d:0 "It seems that our resistance was vain. The Yakut soldiers, unable to contain the Siberian Army are raising the white flags and surrender. The Siberian Army is already approaching Yakutsk, and there is nothing we can do now, but to give up the power to Russians."
yak.11.a:0 "A Tragedy!"

yak.12.t:0 "Smuggling Foreign Equipment"
yak.12.d:0 "Our young republic needs weapons to protect its borders, but as a result of the lack of any significant production plants, we are forced to buy weapons from Japan clandestinely. Once a month, we will receive weapons supplies from them, but the success of these deliveries directly depends on the Japanese. At some point, their supply may be intercepted by enemy countries, or they themselves may refuse further supplies, but in these realities we are forced to exist now."
yak.12.a:0 "Let's start!"

yak.13.t:0 "Smuggling Equipment to [FROM.GetName]"
yak.13.d:0 "We have negotiated with [FROM.GetAdjective] government to smuggle them weapons every month, even though this can be dangerous and there is a chance our shipment won't reach its destination. We are free to reject this illegal trade even now, but if we want to help Yakuts in their fight against Russians, they will definitely need some guns."
yak.13.a:0 "Send them a bunch of weapons."
yak.13.b:0 "That's too risky..."

yak.14.t:0 "Weapons From [FROM.GetName]"
yak.14.d:0 "The shipment of Japanese weapons has reached our borders and we successfully received our weapons!"
yak.14.a:0 "Waiting for the next delivery!"

yak.15.t:0 "Weapons Captured"
yak.15.d:0 "The weapons that were sent to the Yakuts have been captured by Russians! This brings us to the discussion if we should stop our shipments, as we risk to arm the Russian soldiers with free Japanese guns!"
yak.15.a:0 "We shall still try to send them weapons."
yak.15.b:0 "That's too risky..."

yak.16.t:0 "Successful Shipment to Yakutia!"
yak.16.d:0 "The shipment of our weapons has reached the borders of Yakutia and they successfully received our weapons!"
yak.16.a:0 "Send them more!"
yak.16.b:0 "That's too risky..."

yak.17.t:0 "Japan Stops the Shipments!"
yak.17.d:0 "It seems that the [JAP.GetAdjective] government has stopped sending us the equipment, perhaps because of the frequent interceptions."
yak.17.a:0 "We have to cope ourselves now!"

yak.18.t:0 "Yhyakh Celebration!"
yak.18.d:0 "Sakha people celebrate the New Year in summer – according to the ancient traditions. The winter temperatures sometimes reach minus 60°C, while the summer is very short, lasting only three months. The holiday is celebrated in the middle of June, at the beginning of summer.\nThe Sakha Yhyakh festival (literally meaning "abundance") is related to a cult of a solar deity, with a fertility cult. Ancient Sakha celebrated the New Year at the Yhyakh festival. Its traditions include women and children decorating trees and tethering posts with "salama" (nine bunches of horse hair hung on horse-hair ropes). The oldest man, wearing white, opens the holiday. He starts the ritual by sprinkling kymys on the ground, feeding the fire. He prays to the Aiy spirits for the well-being of the people who depend on them and asks the spirits to bless all the people gathered. Afterwards, people sing and dance Ohuakhai, play national games, eat national dishes, and drink kymys."
yak.18.a:0 "Khaya-D'yenke!"
yak.180.a:0 "Khaya-D'yenke!"

yak.19.t:0 "Choosing the National Flag"
yak.19.d:0 "Originally used in the Yakut Uprising in 1918, the flag was a black-white-red tricolor, and was indistinguishable from the civil flag of the German Empire. Until now, the flag has remained an unchanged symbol of the Yakut independence. However, in connection with the emergence of our state, many members of the government think that perhaps a new flag is needed, which would more accurately symbolize the Sakha people, and not be associated with the German Imperial flag. There is also a second variant, the white-green-black tricolor, where the White color symbolizes Siberian snow, green-taiga, and black-earth, which of course more reflects the national characteristics of Sakha"
yak.19.a:0 "Black-White-Red tricolor"
yak.19.b:0 "White-Green-Black tricolor"

yak.20.t:0 "[GetYear] Yakut Constituent Elections"
yak.20.d:0 "The time has come for people of Yakutia to vote. There are 4 parties present at the elections.\nThe leftists, MNSPSBK(k) or Confederalists, led by Pavel Ksenofontov are seeking to establish an equal and modernized Yakut society based on ideas of fraternity and socialism. Their ideas though are based on the Bukharin's ideology of market socialism as Ksenofontov believes that only through having a solid national economy with progressive taxation Sakha will prosper.\n\nThe second party is the Federalists, led by Gavriil Ksenofontov (a namesake of the previous candidate, though), who believe that Yakut people should be educated and live in a capitalist society, though his views on autonomy is quite tolerant.\n\nThe third party are the Union of Sakha, led by Kulumnuur, a representative from Yakut intelligentsia, who was once elected the Governor of Yakutia in 1918, though quickly losing his position in the chaos of the Civil War. First off, their main goal is to preserve the Sakha culture.\n\nThe last but not the least is the nationalist party of Sakah D'ono, led by an eccentric poet and writer Platon Oyunsky, whose views, while being rather close to the Conservatives, are a bit more radical. He believes that only through independence and armed defence the Sakha people will prosper.\nThe elections have already started in Yakutsk and soon we will know the results." 
yak.20.a:0 "Confederalists!"
yak.20.b:0 "Federalists!"
yak.20.c:0 "Union of Sakha!"
yak.20.e:0 "Sakah D'ono!"

yak.21.t:0 "Sakha Constitution"
yak.21.d:0 "There is only one thing Pavel Ksenofontov is absolutely sure to become the main achievement of the Sakha people - the Constitution, which will guarantee its independence, development and safety of cultural norms and traditions. The adoption of Consitution is an essential step in our nation-building process."
yak.21.a:0 "Glory to the Constitution!"

yak.22.t:0 "First Stage of Vseobuch"
yak.22.d:0 "Vseobuch, short for Universal Education , is the beginning of the rebirth of the Yakut people from the colonial period. The state will allocate money for the construction of schools and universities, so that young and adult Yakuts learn writing and mathematics and can move our society forward."
yak.22.a:0 "A Great Reform!"

yak.23.t:0 "New Foreign Partners"
yak.23.d:0 "Esablishing friendly relations with foreign nations is considered to be an important step in building our country. We shall send delegations to the Great Powers of the world and ask for their recognition of our state and, perhaps, even to open their Embassies in Yakutsk. Their recognition will show to the world that Sakha are strong and that our nation is respected."
yak.23.a:0 "Let's wait for their answers."

yak.24.t:0 "Yakutia Seeks For Recognition"
yak.24.d:0 "The nation of Yakuts have recently declared their independence and now they are seeking for international recognition of their state. While formally recognizing them will definitely worsen our relations with Russia, perhaps it is not so bad as it can seem?"
yak.24.a:0 "We will recognize them"
yak.24.b:0 "We will recognize them and open an Embassy there."
yak.24.c:0 "Who?.."

yak.25.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Recognizes Us"
yak.25.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to recognize our independence. Now we shall send them a request to invest in our economy..."
yak.25.a:0 "A Great Victory for Sakha people!"

yak.26.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Will Open Embassy in Yakutsk"
yak.26.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recognized our independence and even agreed to open their embassy in Yakutsk. Now we shall send them a request to invest in our economy..."

yak.27.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused to Recognize Us!"
yak.27.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] have refused to recognize our state..."
yak.27.a:0 "Too bad..."

yak.28.t:0 "Invest in [FROM.GetName]?"
yak.28.d:0 "The Yakut government offered us to invest in their economy. They claim that gold has already been found in their area, and that they are now in search of the so-called 'blue clay', whatever that means."
yak.28.a:0 "A new Klondike?"
yak.28.b:0 "They are too far away"

yak.29.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agreed to Invest!"
yak.29.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to invest in our economy, which is definitely great for us!"
yak.29.a:0 "A toast to our new friends!"

yak.30.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused to Invest!"
yak.30.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to invest in our economy, which is definitely not too great for us"
yak.30.a:0 "Well, at least they recognized us!"

yak.31.t:0 "The Reformation Period"
yak.31.d:0 "A complex of measures to improve our national-cultural development has been accepted by the president [ROOT.GetLeader] and soon they will be implemented. They include subsidies for local farmers and landowners, increased wages for workers and low taxes for citizens. It seems we are definitely closer and closer to become a true state."
yak.31.a:0 "Splendid!"

yak.32.t:0 "The Local Traditions Bill"
yak.32.d:0 "President [ROOT.GetLeader] has introduced a bill, that will legitimize our local customs and traditions, such as making Yhyakh, a national New Year celebration, a public holiday. Moreover, cattle breeding and fishing and hunting will become state-protected industries of national economy, which will guarantee high salary for the employees. As [ROOT.GetLeader] mentions, more customs and traditions will be legitimized as well, bringing prosperity to our nation and at the same time preserve our culture."
yak.32.a:0 "That's great!"

yak.33.t:0 "The Great Yytachy"
yak.33.d:0 "The very word 'President' is a concept imposed by Russia, which is not inherent in our people, which denies the very essence of Sakha. Our national leader is the person who will guide our country on the path to prosperity, so he should be given the appropriate name. From now on, our leader will call Yytachy, or The Guide. Faith in his great rule will help our people to cope with all the troubles, especially with the Russian colonizers."
yak.33.a:0 "Long Live Yytachy!"

yak.34.t:0 "The Fate of Evenks"
yak.34.d:0 "The people of the Evenks, or Tungus, who inhabit the lower reaches of the Lena River, although not completely under the jurisdiction of our state, have minorities on our territory. They are not our kindred people, coming from Mongolia and China, who profess a different faith and do not recognize us, the Sakha, as the legitimate rulers of the Sakha. And the position of the Great Guide is as follows. The Evenks must recognize the Sakha and recognize themselves as the Sakha. Otherwise, they have no place on the territory of our country. Let them leave here or become us. Nothing else is given."
yak.34.a:0 "Isn't it too cruel?"

yak.35.t:0 "Urung Aar Toyon"
yak.35.d:0 "The Aiys are the inhabitants of the Upper World, the progenitors of the Sakha people, the supreme patrons who gave our people independence. Thanks to their support, we managed to survive. Shamanism and the belief in Aiy, previously persecuted by Russian colonists, will now be free and institutionalized. Urung Aar Toyon, oh the Bright Creator Lord, bring glory and prosperity to our people, we, the flock of yours, pray to you!"
yak.35.a:0 "The Brightest Lords of Sakha"

yak.50.t:0 "Aldanzoloto Industries"
yak.50.d:0 "In 1923, when Yakutia was still a Russian territory, gold was found by Yakut free prospectors on the banks of the Aldan River. The development of the mines was prevented by the Kolchak putsch, as a result of which Yakutia became part of Transamur. Despite the fact that the mines continued to be developed, the pace was very low. Now that Yakutia is finally independent, we can attract foreign investors and creditors and form the Aldanzoloto Industries state Trust for the purpose of extracting this valuable mineral and its subsequent sale. Thanks to the trust, Yakutia will become one of the richest countries in the Far East."
yak.50.a:0 "Sakha Klondike is opened!"

yak.51.t:0 "The New Expedition to Find the §CBlue Clay§!"
yak.51.d:0 "The pathfinder and guide Ulukitkan, known throughout Yakutia, became one of the leaders of the blue clay search expedition. Many years ago, rumors spread across Siberia about the existence of an amazing blue clay-sparkling and incredibly durable. However, these were just rumors spread by some fools. Despite the fact that there was distrust of this information, by this time it was already known about the discovery of precious diamonds in South Africa and the Kolchak government unsuccessfully tried to find diamonds in Yakutia. Valuable stones would serve as sources of wealth for the country and for people.\n\nNow, the expedition is headed by an experienced Yakut guide, who will definitely be able to help in the discovery of diamonds in Yakutia."
yak.51.a:0 "Good luck to them!"

yak.52.t:0 "The Discovery Of a Diamond Deposit!"
yak.52.d:0 "This is incredible! We did not rely on Ulukitkan for nothing. Thanks to his knowledge of the terrain and hidden places, we came across a whole diamond deposit. A sample of diamond rock has already been delivered to Yakutsk, and leading experts on precious stones have also been invited."
yak.52.a:0 "That's incredible!"

yak.53.t:0 "Diamonds Discovered in Yakutia"
yak.53.d:0 "The news have reached the world from the partially recognized state of Yakutia in the heart of Siberian Taiga.\n\nLocated in the basin of the river Lena in the Eastern Siberia, Yakutia is known for its rich gold mines, already named the New Klondike. Now, it seems, that their land is also rich with diamonds. Several foreign powers are already starting negotiations to invest in Yakutia and have better conditions to trade with them."
yak.53.a:0 "Unbelievable!"

yak.54.t:0 "Independence of Yakutia"
yak.54.d:0 "A new country has emerged in the Eastern Siberia. The Sakha people, or Yakuts, have used the chaos in the Far-Eastern Republic of Transamur to declare their independence and once again establish their own state.\n\nAlready rebelling against Russian yoke, the last most successful revolt was in 1919, during the Russian Civil War. Now, it seems that the Yakuts have finally secured their independence against the Russians."
yak.54.a:0 "Where is it even located?"

yak.60.t:0 "Trial of VYaONU"
yak.60.d:0 "An extremist group of Yakut national separatists, calling themselves the Provisional Yakut Regional People's Administration, headed by Georgy Efimov, are accused of high treason to the Supreme Ruler of Russia. Having seized power in the Yakut region, the accused declared the overthrow of the Russian government in Yakutia and the proclamation of an independent state, which is contrary to the Constitution of Russia of 1921, and contrary to the decree of the Supreme Ruler of 1925 on the indivisibility and impossibility of alienating the territories of Russia. On the basis of these documents, the perpetrators are sentenced to death by firing squad."
yak.60.a:0 "Traitors of Russia!"

yak.61.t:0 "The New Supreme Ruler"
yak.61.d:0 "Due to the Kolchak's failure, Smolin considers that there is no other way, but claim the mantle of the Supreme Ruler of Russia.\n\nEven though he is captured here, in Yakutia, among resistant Yakuts, perhaps this is the only thing he has to do. The chances of reclaiming all of Russia are very low - but perhaps this will play out."
yak.61.a:0 "Long live the Supreme Ruler!"

yak.70.t:0 "The Socialist Unrest"
yak.70.d:0 "Outraged by our authoritarian rule, in some villages the most enterprising citizens declared their distrust of our government. The Yakut peasants insist on social protection and privileges for them, while our policy drives them into poverty and misery, while the nobility rejoices.\n\nCitizens unite under the slogans 'All power - to the Yakut Council' and 'We trust Ammosov, not [ROOT.GetLeader]'. We can subsidize the peasants and hope that they will be satisfied, or we can ignore their demands."
yak.70.a:0 "Help the poor!"
yak.70.b:0 "Who are they to dictate the rules?"

yak.71.t:0 "Socialist Revolution!"
yak.71.d:0 "Enraged by the disregard for them, the Yakut peasants, united by Ammosov, declared their disobedience to our government. From all villages and villages, peasants are uniting under red flags and have announced a march to Yakutsk in order to seize power into their own hands. Our government mobilized the Yakut Army in order to calm the rebels, but the soldiers, the same ordinary Yakuts, refused to shoot at the rebels and suppress the protest, and some even joined. The beneficiaries of the uprising - the Ammosov clique, also known as YaNSP, broke into the building of the Council of Yakutia, and using their advantage, arrested and suspended former members of the government, including [ROOT.GetLeader]. After that, the flag of Yakutia was removed, and a red banner was raised instead. Ammosov declared the victory of the Soviets and declared himself the First Chairman of Yakutia."
yak.71.a:0 "Long live Soviet Yakutia!"

yak.202.t:0 "The Question of Ancestral Unity"
yak.202.d:0 "Millennia ago, the Bering Strait was frozen over, allowing passage by land between Asia and North America quite possible. This caused a series of migrations and counter-migrations that resulted in the seeding of Human life and civilization across the New World. Though untold centuries have passed, the genetics of the Yakut people and the wider peoples of Mongolia and Siberia are still close to the blood of the Native Americans. Interestingly, the world now is blessed with both an independent Yakut state and an independent Native American state, both centered around the great Bering Sea, and both desperate for allies in this harsh and unforgiving world. With this in mind, we have propositioned our kin across the Bering Sea to form an alliance, so that together, we can resist neocolonialism and imperialism in all its forms while bringing our disparate people together as if it was 20,000 B.C.E all over again."
yak.202.a:0 "We welcome our long lost kin with open arms!"
yak.202.b:0 "We do not need these misguided foreign fools!"

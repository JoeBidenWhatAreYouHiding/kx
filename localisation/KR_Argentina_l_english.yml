### Leaders ###
POLITICS_CARLES_DESC:0 "Manuel Carlés began his political career when he joined the Union Civica Radical 1898, which had been gaining popularity as it had recently been formed, back in 1891. He then climbed through the ranks of the party until he managed to become a national deputy for the province of Santa Fe in the national congress. He was assigned in 1918 by his colleague, president Hipólito Yrigoyen, as 'Interventor' of the Salta province, starting a long record of interventions by said government. His methods granted him enough experience to be allowed to become a teacher in the 'Colegio Militar de la Nacion' and the 'Escuela Superior de Guerra'.\n\nWith the unoficial formation of the 'Liga Patriotica' during the 'Semana Tragica', Carlés began making contact with the organisation, which was officially born in 1920 with Carlés as its leader. The organisation then began promoting the persecution of jews, anarchists, socialists and foreigners that refuse to integrate to the local Argentinean culture, and with the growing unrest, he began scheming his takeover, backed by many within the navy and a few army officers. With his coup d'etat now being successful, he now sits in the 'Casa Rosada' in Buenos Aires, but his regime has not yet been recognized by the other provinces. Whether he'll be able to secure power and accomplish his promises of expansion and prosperity remains to be seen..."
POLITICS_DOMINGO_PERON_DESC:0 "Juan Domingo Perón, having grown up in the rural Patagonia, entered the 'Colegio Militar de la Nación' In 1911 thanks to a scholarship paid by Antonio M. Silva, a close friend of his grandfather. Despite becoming a national fencing champion, which turned him into a celebrity for the oligarchy, he's hardly had any relevant political position in his life, but the FOP's secession from Argentina has caused him great concern. After a short trip to Europe, he has changed his point of view regarding politics, and has returned to Argentina motivated by a will to help the working men of the country and take the nation to new heights. Now, with many in the lower classes, the trade unions and even in the Oligarchy desiring Peron's leadership, it remains to be seen if he will truly be able to achieve his promises..."
POLITICS_ALICIA_JUSTO_DESC:0 "Alicia Moreau de Justo was born in 1885 in the city of London, England. Her father, Armand Mureau, was a member of the French Paris Commune during the 1871 uprising and Her family was forced to move to Argentina in 1890. She met Hipólito Yrigoyen, who was professor of moral and civic instruction in her school, where they kept a friendly relation, with Yrigoyen beggining to inspire the young woman towards political activism. In 1906 she founded the Argentinean Feminist Movement, joining the Socialist Party and later entering the 'Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Buenos Aires' in 1907, where she graduated as a Physician a few years later.\n\nHowever, with the Great War raging on and the anarchist uprisings, her views began to conflict with the more radicalized Baldomeristas in the PS. As the Red Scare ran through the nation, she was forced to go underground until very recently. Always valuing democracy and pacifism, now Mureau has managed to become Head of State, where she is bound to try to take the country towards her vision of a new, equal and peaceful Argentina."
POLITICS_PABLO_RAMIREZ_DESC:0 "Pedro Pablo Ramirez went to military school at a young age, even managing to serve in the German Army until 1913. He was one of the most active members of the 1930 Uriburu's coup d’état, and was his head of the information service of the general staff until Uriburu's death in 1932. While not a direct member of the GOU, his son is one of the founders, granting him a wide array of military and political contacts that he can use if the situation requires it.\n\nNow that Ramirez has managed to become Head of State, he shall rule Argentina with an iron-fist, trying to enforce the discipline, nationalism and faith in Catholicism he was taught to the Argentinean society at large. However, it remains to be seen if his connections within the GOU are enough to stay in power if he ever manages to deviate from their vision for Argentina..."
POLITICS_JOSE_TAMBORINI_DESC:0 "Jose Pascual Tamborini joined the 'Union Civica Radical' when he was still in highschool. He was one of the mediators between the workers at the 'Taller Vassena' and the national authorities, where he failed to successfully reach a compromise, which lead to a major crackdown in the events leading up to the dreaded 'Semana Tragica'. His party didn't fare much better, as the increasing authoritarianism of Yrigoyen began splitting the party into the old 'UCR' and the new 'Union Civica Radical Antipersonalista'.\n\nTamborini joined the latter while he was minister of the interior during Marcelo T. de Alvear's presidency. In 1935 he was chosen as national deputy, and his political experience has managed to allow him to get enough support to run for presidency. Now that he's head of state, it falls to him to bring about the reforms that Leandro N. Alem, founder of the 'UCR' back in 1891, had envisioned for Argentina, and end once and for all the corrupt practices that have plagued Argentinean democracy!"
POLITICS_ROBUSTIANO_COSTAS_DESC:0 "Robustiano Patrón Costas graduated from highschool in 1895 and by 1900, he had graduated the 'Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Sociales de Buenos Aires' as a Lawyer with a PhD in jurisprudence, accomplishing one of his father's last wishes before he died. Robustiano took over his father's company, 'Patrón Hermanos' and then went on to become involved in Salta's Politics until he was elected governor of the same province between 1913 and 1916 with an independent party. His government in that province was characterized by great political stability and financial balance, and became one of the first provinces to fully embrace the Saenz Peña law.\n\nIn 1932, with the death of Uriburu and the upcoming elections, he formed among other independent leaders the 'Partido Democratico Nacional', where he was chosen as head of the party. Now that Robustiano has managed to achieve presidency, his entrepreneurial spirit, fiscal responsibility and compromise skills will surely usher in a new age of economic prosperity for Argentina."
POLITICS_NICOLAS_REPETTO_DESC:0 "Nicolas Repetto graduated as physician from the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' with plenty of experience in surgery thanks to an European internship which lasted until 1897. He was very active in politics from a young age, participating in the 'Revolucion del Parque' in 1890. Afterwards, he founded with his friend, Juan B. Justo, the 'Diario del Pueblo', one of the first socialist newspapers in Argentina. In 1900 he finally decided to affiliate to the 'Partido Socialista' which Justo had helped found, and then both founded the cooperative 'El Hogar Obrero' in 1905.\n\nAfter the death of Juan B. Justo, he became the obvious candidate of the now more moderate Partido Socialista, but didn't manage to win the 1932 national elections. Now that he has managed to become president, he'll strive to turn Argentina away from the exploitative practices of the past and into a better, more egalitarian tomorrow."
POLITICS_HIPOLITO_YRIGOYEN_DESC:0 "When Juan Hipólito del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Yrigoyen finished high school, he began his political career when he assisted Alem in the creation of the Union Civica, and when it subsequently split during the Roca regime, he continued assisting his uncle with the Union Civica Radical. He kept climbing through the ranks of the party until becoming his uncle right-hand man and participating in the 'Revolución del Parque' as one of the main instigators. However, Alem's suicide became a hard hit for the UCR, and an even harder hit for Yrigoyen, who temporarily retired from politics until 1904, working as a teacher in the meantime.\n\nHe then reorganized the UCR in 1904 and managed to get one of his friends, Roque Sáenz Peña, elected as President in 1910, and even becoming President himself from 1916 to 1922. He pushed for progressive reforms and tried to normalize the Argentinean electoral system, even intervening in provinces that were under the control of wealthy elites. He even began granting workers better work laws and began negotiating with many strikers. However, British pressure forced him to begin the crackdowns that lead to the 'Semana Tragica', and the events that subsequently created the FOP.\n\nHis increasing authoritarianism lead to factionalism in the UCR and the subsequent split of the UCRA, and when he was re-elected in 1938, where his antagonizing position against the army and the local elites caused the Uriburu's 1930 coup, where he was banned from politics. Now that he's president again, he'll finish the reforms that he started in 1928 and will try to bring about his uncle's vision of a strong and democratic Argentina."
POLITICS_JOSE_PETER_DESC:0 "Jose Peter, like many other 'Gauchos' from rural areas, was forced to move to the big cities in search of work, more specifically to the city of Zarate in 1923. His first political experience was in 1927, when he signed up with the 'Sindicato de Frigorificos de Zarate', where he helped create the 'Federación Obreros de la Industria de la Carne' with other trade unions of Zarate and Berisso.\n\nWhen Uriburu came to power, he was sent to the Ushuaia penitentiary after organizing a successful strike where he demanded the company 'River Plate de Zarate' to pay their worker's wages which had been delayed for two months. Now that he's free and in control of Argentina, he'll make sure to provide justice for the workers from the exploitation of the bourgeoisie."
POLITICS_ANGEL_BORLENGHI_DESC:0 "Angel Borlenghi became involved in politics with the local socialists of Pompeya's neighbourhood at a very young age, joining the 'Gremio de Empleados de Comercio'('Trade Employees Syndicate') and the Socialist Party as soon as he came of age. Unlike the leadership within the Socialist Party, he liked to keep direct contact with the workers, which gained him a lot of support among the trade unions. Despite having an illustrious performance within the 'CGT' ('Central General del Trabajo'), he never managed to climb up the ranks within the Socialist Party.\n\nAfter Uriburu's coup and the subsequent crackdowns on anarchist, syndicalists and socialists, he was arrested and taken to the Ushuaia penitentiary. Now that he's free and sits within the 'Casa Rosada', He'll use his connections within the Trade Unions to lead Argentina to a better tomorrow with the worker's consent."
POLITICS_ARTURO_FRONDIZI_DESC:0 "Arturo Frondizi was a strong supporter of the UCR and a defender of democracy when Yrigoyen managed to win the presidency, but refused to participate in any sort of political activity. However, Uriburu's coup forced him to change his point of view regarding democracy, where he even refused attending his own graduation ceremony which Uriburu would attend to give him an Honor Diploma in Law.\n\nHe was arrested in a democratic demonstration in 1931. This very detention has made Frondizi decide to leave his work as a law professor and begin a career as a politician. At the end of 1932, he was arrested at another rally, and when he was released he joined the UCR.\n\nHe has since then joined a faction within the UCR that considers the approach of Marcelo T. de Alvear to be too conservative, and he has made promises to bring more progressive reforms to Argentina and return to the economic policies Yrigoyen enacted. Now that he sits in the 'Casa Rosada', it remains to be seen if he'll be true to his word."
POLITICS_RICARDO_BALBIN_DESC:0 "In 1922, when he became 18, Ricardo Balbín joined the UCR and moves to La Plata, where local political activism drove him to sign up in the 'Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata', where he graduated as a lawyer in 1927, but hardly ever using his title as he has since then fully committed to his political career.\n\nHe was chosen as provincial deputy in 1932 and 1940, however, he resigned his last post in condemnation to the fraud that plagued local elections. He has since then left the UCR and joined the more moderate 'Partido Democrata Nacional', where he has promised to bring an end to the corruption that plagues Argentinean society and finally usher in a new era of prosperity."
POLITICS_ROBERTO_ORTIZ_DESC:0 "Roberto Marcelino Ortiz signed up into the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' to study medicine, but he was forced to change his career to Law due to a strike from the student's centre which caused the medicine section to be closed down temporarily. He affiliated the UCR and participated in the failed 1905 revolution. When the UCR split, he joined the UCRA and became public works minister for Marcelo T. de Alvear.\n\nDespite his support for the democratic process, he supported Uriburu's coup, although he despised Uriburu's economic policies. After the Carlés coup, Ortiz has become convinced that the political corruption in Argentina has to end once and for all if democracy is ever to survive in Argentina, and will endeavour all of his efforts from the 'Casa Rosada' to strengthen the democratic process and end local corruption, with intervention if needed."
POLITICS_EDELMIRO_FARRELL_DESC:0 "Born to an Irish migrant family, Edelmiro Julian Farrel enrolled in a military school and graduated in 1907. While no one doubts of his military ability and personal charisma, he was never prepared to be a politician. Now that the role of presidency has been thrusted upon him after overthrowing Ramirez, he has become a mere puppet of the GOU's control over the country. He relies mostly on his vice-president, Juan Domingo Peron, to do most of the political work, where Farrel only ever appears in public ceremonies and signs public documents in the name of the GOU."
POLITICS_MARCELO_ALVEAR_DESC:0 "Alvear became involved in politics at a young age, helping organize a meeting in Jardin Florida which would lead to the 'Revolución del Parque', after which he became secretary for Leandro N. Alem. He continued serving Alem until his suicide, after which he left to France for a time and got married. He was elected deputy between 1912 and 1916 without even residing in the country, forcing him to return to Argentina during the Sáenz Peña regime, after which he became Argentinean ambassador to France, even donating a large amount of wealth for the construction of front line hospitals.\n\nHe was elected as president from 1922 to 1928, where he tried to reduce the FOP's influence in Argentina at large by granting better rights for workers in the country, although he had kept a hardline stance towards the FOP, mostly due to militaristic influences in his staff. Like his predecessor, Yrigoyen, he tried to intervene provinces that had their elections rigged by wealthy local elites, but his methods polarized the UCR and the UCRA even more. Nevertheless, his progressive social, educational and economic reforms have left a positive impression in the Argentinean people, and now that he's been re-elected as president, he'll try to re-enact and continue the reforms for which he stood for in his first presidency."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_DE_ANDREA_DESC:0 "Miguel de Andrea began his career after being ordained in 1899 by the Bishop of La Plata, Juan Terrero. He climbed steadily the ranks of the church until becoming the Head Priest of the San Miguel de Arcangel Church, and being named director of a Social-Christian Trade Union, the Circulos Obreros Catolicos, after the death of its founder, Federico Grote. However, unlike his founder, Miguel de Andrea took a hardline stance against the rising anarchist movements growing in the city of Buenos Aires, and as such quickly found himself aligning with the Liga Patriotica, taking part in their rallies and putting them into contact with the most reactionary sectors of the Argentinean branch of the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, his views never aligned with the league, and he found himself coinciding more with the Portuguese Integralists who catered to his anti-liberal, ultra-catholic and Corporatist mindset. While originally skeptic of a Brazilian victory, he quickly abandoned the Liga Patriotica as the defeat seemed imminent, and began pushing his contacts in the Brazilian church in order to proclaim his loyalty to the Integralists. Without any solid military or civilian leaders willing to obey Brazilian commands, Miguel was chosen as the provisional President of Argentina until a more stable government can be settled in favour of the Integralist doctrine, which Miguel believes will finally bring faith in God, the Church and the government back to the workers."

ARG_Power_of_Capital_desc:0 "Since our nation was born, Argentina has had a meteoric rise to the top amongst some of the wealthiest nations in the world.

After all, money makes the world go round and Argentina is part of this world."

ARG_Uphold_the_Status_Quo_desc:0 "The recent developments in our country have left our populace really distrustful of radical politicians. Our people need solid ground to stand on and the radical ideas other parties encourage might be the chance we need to secure our popularity. As a bonus, plenty of officers in the army support us, which allows us to move a bit more freely without the fear of a treacherous coup."
ARG_Church_Ties:0 "Church Ties"

ARG_Ties_with_Germany:0 "Ties with Germany"
ARG_Ties_with_Germany_desc:0 "As our primary trade partner, it only makes sense that Germany is our first pick for an alliance. While Ramírez is a fan of seeking closer ties to the Germans, especially considering the huge amount of German migrants Argentina has received over the years, others have voiced their concerns and could act if we would risk Argentinean neutrality by joining a faction that might draw our peaceful country into war."

ARG_Five_Year_Plan:0 "First Five-Year Plan"
ARG_Five_Year_Plan_desc:0 "Even though we pursued rapid industrialisation in the last decade to cope with the loss of British imports, our economy is not on par with our European examples.

ARG_Reduce_Textile_Reliance:0 "Reduce Reliance on Textile"

ARG_Mobilise_the_Reserves_desc:0 "The time for war has come and nations all around the Southern Cone are mobilising for what is deemed to be unpreventable now.

ARG_La_Plata_desc:0 "The Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata, or the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, was a short-lived attempt by our forebears to unify the lands of the Southern Cone under one united government. Save for most of Chile, all nations within this River Plate region, from Argentina to Paraguay to even Southern Bolivia, once flew the same banner as we - all ruled from the shining, river-side metropolis of Buenos Aires. With our newfound stability, the topic of this old idea’s revival has once again resurfaced, and it is finally time to put this debate to rest once and for all."

ARG_Republican_Airforce:0 "Republican Air Force"
ARG_Republican_Airforce_desc:0 "Previously, only the birds flew above Argentina. With the Weltkrieg, the aircraft has proven to be a vital military piece of equipment. In order to control the skies above Argentina, we must fund the FAA, which stands for 'Fuerzas Aerea Argentina'. While it shall be subordinate to the army until it consolidates, we hope to make it as strong as our army and navy are at the moment."
ARG_Rain_Down_Hellfire:0 "Rain down Hell"
ARG_Rain_Down_Hellfire_desc:0 "Not only does the aircraft permit leisure flights over the Andes, but it also permits to penetrate deep into enemy territory. By constructing large bombers which can carry a large payload of bombs, we can damage and destroy vital enemy infrastructure from the air."
ARG_Strategic_Destruction:0 "Carpet Bombing runs"
ARG_Strategic_Destruction_desc:0 "A single bomber might damage a railway, but a concentrated wave of bombers will destroy the entire railway hub. By bombing a large surface with a formation of bombers, we will be able to deal decisive damage to the enemy."

ARG_CAS_Focus_desc:0 "Bombers don't have to be large and heavy, they can also be as small as a normal fighter. These more agile planes will be perfect to support our ground forces on the battlefield with precision bombing strikes."
ARG_Air_Doctrine:0 "Doctrinal Advances"
ARG_Air_Doctrine_desc:0 "Ever since the creation of the 'Fuerza Aerea Argentina', it has greatly developed. In order to render it an equal military force to the army and navy, we must develop new aerial doctrines."
ARG_War_Experience:0 "Combat Experience"
ARG_War_Experience_desc:0 "In theory, our bombers can easily bomb enemy ground forces while our fighters stop any hostile aircraft. In practice, the situation in the air can become quite chaotic. With these new experiences, we can improve our aerial doctrine."
ARG_License_Foreign_Planes:0 "License Foreign Planes"
ARG_License_Foreign_Planes_desc:0 "Our glorious nation doesn't have all that many skilled aircraft designers. Until we can further develop our aviation industry, we need to rely on foreign designs."

ARG_Argentine_Navy_desc:0 "The Armada Argentina (Argentinean Navy) it's currently the 8th most powerful navy in the world, preceded only by the European powers, the US and Japan.

ARG_Fleet_on_the_Open_Seas_desc:0 "With most of our trade depending on sea lanes and many of our cities sitting on the Atlantic's shores, we need a fleet capable of maintaining control in the Open Seas, no matter the foe they might face"
ARG_Escorting_Ships:0 "Escort Ships"
ARG_Escorting_Ships_desc:0 "Argentina is considered to be the 'Granary of the World'. However, this reputation would be ill-founded if we allowed our transports to be sunk by rogue enemy ships. In order to protect these ships and their valuable cargo, we have decided it will be smart to invest in escort ships"
ARG_Quick_but_Powerful:0 "Quick but Powerful"
ARG_Quick_but_Powerful_desc:0 "Sea Warfare is changing. It's no longer enough to fit huge guns into large armoured mechanical sea monsters, it's also necessary for them to be able to catch up and flank enemy fleets effectively and to be able to dodge enemy fire that would otherwise be lethal."
ARG_Submarine_Focus:0 "Submarine Focus"
ARG_Submarine_Focus_desc:0 "Naval High command acquired three Sicilian submarines 4 years ago. Since then, the 'Tarantinos', as they've been called by their crews, have performed remarkably well, and naval commander Ramón A. Poch insists in the potential this invention has for the future of naval warfare and that we should continue to invest in them."
ARG_Battlecruisers:0 "Battlecruisers"
ARG_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Our ten-year long investment in our navy is paying off with the presence of several battleships in our docks. However, we realized we lack a middle ground between our heavily armed but slow battleships and our lightly armed but fast cruisers. To fill this gap, we've decided it'll be best to invest in modern Battlecruisers."
ARG_Coastal_Protection:0 "Coastal Protection"
ARG_Coastal_Protection_desc:0 "Our people's prosperity depends on keeping an open route to the sea. With that in mind, we can't allow the enemy to mine our shores and ports, so we need to invest in minesweepers and better spotting mechanisms for our navy."
ARG_Light_Cruisers:0 "Light Cruisers"
ARG_Light_Cruisers_desc:0 "The 'Trento' class cruisers we bought a few years ago from the Sicilian Dockyards have become great additions to our fleet. Unfortunately, they are way too heavily armed for our current needs. However, our engineers have been hard at work to develop a better and lighter version that will give their bigger cousins a run for their money."
ARG_Carriers:0 "Naval Aviation"
ARG_Carriers_desc:0 "Aeroplanes have risen to prominence in the last decades and that is something we cannot deny. While we might be hard-pressed to match any of the top naval powers in the world, we could compensate our lack of strength with planes that might tip the odds of a naval battle in our favour."
ARG_Tandanor_Shipyards:0 "Expand Talleres Navales de la Marina"
ARG_Tandanor_Shipyards_desc:0 "Rising tensions with the other naval powers of South America and the necessity to stay competitive have forced us to consider an expansion of our dockyards and who better to do this than Talleres Navales de la Marina?"

ARG_ASTARSA_Expansion_desc:0 "The 'Astilleros Argentinos Rio de la Plata S.A.' (Argentinean Dockyards of the La Plata River S.A.) is one of the most important naval companies we have in our country. Expanding their facilities will help us produce a navy that will make the socialists tremble!"
ARG_Cruiser_Program:0 "Cruiser Program"

ARG_Expand_the_Docks_desc:0 "Our Docks, while impressive for a South American Country, are no longer enough for our ambitions! If we want to surpass the other powers in the world, an expansion of our docks is in order."
#ARG_Merchant_Marine:0 "Merchant Marine" already defined above as an idea
ARG_Merchant_Marine_desc:0 "While Argentineans love to take pride in their military navy, the most important branch is not the military naval marine, but the merchant one. Without them, we'd be isolated from the world that awaits our products with open arms and that has made this country great. An investment in the merchant marine is in order."
ARG_Land_Fortifications:0 "Protecting the Coast"
ARG_Land_Fortifications_desc:0 "Our three main port cities, Buenos Aires, Mar del Plata and Bahia Blanca are currently unprotected from a naval invasion if our foes managed to tie down or destroy our fleet. To guard us against this eventuality, we have decided to focus on making strong fortifications in the cities and some light forts all along the coastline."
ARG_Comando_de_Infanteria_de_Marina:0 "Comando de Infanteria de Marina"
ARG_Comando_de_Infanteria_de_Marina_desc:0 "While the Argentinean Marines haven't had many chances to prove their worth, the exploits of Captain Hipólito Bouchard back in the day have proven the value of a landing force. If we ever hope to match and surpass other modern marine forces, we need to expand our separate command for our Marines, the 'Comando de la Infanteria de Marina'"
ARG_Oficina_Central_de_Hidrografia:0 "Oficina Central de Hidrografía"
ARG_Oficina_Central_de_Hidrografia_desc:0 "In naval warfare, it's not just about having better ships and officers. We need to expand the Oficina Central de Hidrografía (Central Office of Hydrography) in order to better analyse weather, naval geology, oceanography and nautical cartography not just of our home waters but also those of our enemies. Our enemies will find we're at home wherever we may encounter them."
ARG_Rule_Britannia_Britannia_Rules_the_Waves:0 "Irse a Pique Antes que Rendir el Pabellón!"
ARG_Rule_Britannia_Britannia_Rules_the_Waves_desc:0 "'We'll go to the bottom before surrendering our ensign!' was the battle cry Admiral Guillermo Brown gave before going into the fray at the battle of Quilmes in 1826 against the Brazilian navy.

#Events
## Military ##
argmil.10.t:0 "Lack of Funding in the Navy"
argmil.10.d:0 "Recent government adjustments to the military budget have brought our naval spending down to dangerous levels. While this has greatly empowered the military and the development of new land-based weaponry, officers from the ARA have warned us that further pulling down the budget could have dangerous consequences on the prowess of our fleet."
argmil.10.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.11.t:0 "Trouble in the Dockyards"
argmil.11.d:0 "Originating from the lack of new government contracts, some of our dockyards have been forced to close down, firing hundreds of naval workers. Social tensions between the government and the Naval Unions were already high and the recent crisis may have only worsened the relations."
argmil.11.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.12.t:0 "Explosion in Puerto Belgrano"
argmil.12.d:0 "During a routine inspection of one of our destroyers in the port, an explosion rocked the ship killing dozens of sailors and severely damaging the vessel. While official state propaganda reported the incident as a syndicalist terrorist attack, the real perpetrator is a lack of maintenance of our ever growing fleet and the incapacity of our engineering staff."
argmil.12.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.13.t:0 "Fighting in Buenos Aires"
argmil.13.d:0 "Increasing aversion between the military branches of our army came to blows last night in Buenos Aires when a group of drunk ARA sailors encountered a military patrol. Arguments surrounding the recent budget cuts for the navy led to a fistfight between the two parties and was quickly followed up by further soldiers joining in. Gendarmería eventually broke up the fights and placed the perpetrators in custody but all help came too late for one of the sailors who died of his injuries 3 hours later in the hospital."
argmil.13.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.20.t:0 "Lack of funding in the Army"
argmil.20.d:0 "Recent government adjustments to the military budget have brought our Army spending down to dangerous levels. While this has greatly empowered the ARA and the development of new warships, officers from the Army have warned us that further pulling down the budget could have dangerous consequences on the prowess of our land forces and could open us up to foreign invasions."
argmil.20.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.21.t:0 "Rampant Desertion in the Army"
argmil.21.d:0 "Worsening living standards in the Barracks and lowered wages of our soldiers have caused many to abandon the armed forces and return to their families to support them in the wake of the economic crisis. Military Police and Gendarmería are tasked with tracking down the offenders but have as of now not been able to make a noticeable difference."
argmil.21.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.22.t:0 "Lack of Military Steel"
argmil.22.d:0 "New orders by the ARA have swallowed up all of our steel reserves and are putting orders for the land forces on the backburner. Tanks, planes and even machine guns have all been forced to lower their production to accommodate the lowered reserves and are making it hard for our army to stay up to date and fully equipped."
argmil.22.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.23.t:0 "Lack of Skilled Officers"
argmil.23.d:0 "Lowered wages and better prospects in the ARA have made many of our young potential officers turn away from the land forces and instead follow a career in the Navy. This brain-drain of new talent is weighing hard on the ageing corps and could potentially impact our capacity to lead our troops against the enemies."
argmil.23.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.24.t:0 "Perón Introduces Alberte to the GOU"
argmil.24.d:0 "In a general staff meeting at El Palomar military base, General Juan Domingo Peron has presented a new member of the GOU for the staff. His name is Bernardino Alberte, a junior officer that graduated recently from the Military Academy with outstanding grades. However, his lack of experience has not given the best impression to the older members of the staff, as well as the fact that Peron is seemingly trying to put people he trusts in positions of power. Despite this, Peron has reassured the Old Guard about his protege's skills, and being one of the most influential and experienced officers of the GOU and the General Staff, there's no real reason to reject Peron's request. After all, the army could always use more talented officers."
argmil.24.a:0 "Let's hope this doesn't become a common occurrence."

## War in the Southern Cone ##
southern.4.t:0 "Intervention in the Argentinean-Chilean war?"

southern.6.t:0 "Intervention in the Argentinean-Paraguayan war?"
southern.6.d:0 "Argentina has kicked off the Argentinean-Chilean war by invading the FOP rebels in Patagonia which was promptly followed by a declaration of war by the Paraguayans. Since they are aware that we hold claims on various territories of Paraguay and Chile, they have requested us to support them in the fight and be rewarded with our claims should our alliance win."
southern.6.a:0 "Attack Paraguay!"
southern.6.b:0 "We shall attack Paraguay AND Chile!"
southern.6.c:0 "We seek no conflict."

southern.7.t:0 "Bolivia Joins on Our side!"
southern.7.d:0 "To support us in the fight against the despicable syndicalists and their red cronies in Chile, Bolivia has also declared war on [BOL.BOL_enemies_text], pledging their full support for our cause."
southern.7.a:0 "Hurray!"

southern.8.t:0 "Bolivia Remains Neutral"
southern.8.d:0 "Wary of losing yet another war to the tiny nation of Paraguay after their humiliating defeat, Bolivia has proclaimed its neutrality in the conflict and has pledged to support neither side."
southern.8.a:0 "Most unfortunate!"

southern.9.t:0 "Fall of Chile"
southern.9.d:0 "As the last cells crumble under our might, the Chilean war machine has finally been forced to give up and the government surrendered at 4 PM, transferring all power over to us."
southern.9.a:0 "Establish a puppet regime!"
southern.9.b:0 "Annex all of Chile!"

southern.91.t:0 "Fall of Chile"
southern.91.d:0 "As Argentinean boots march through Santiago while last pockets of resistance throughout the nation are being cleaned up, our nation is forced to give up the fight as well. While some claim that we should continue to the bitter end, the population has grown weary of war and public opinion is in favour of a quick end to the conflict."
southern.91.a:0 "Surrender to Argentina."
southern.91.b:0 "We'll show those bastards what a real syndie can do!"

southern.10.t:0 "Fall of Paraguay"
southern.10.d:0 "As the last defenders are driven out of Asunción, the Paraguayan government has conceded defeat and accepted our harsh demands. All of Paraguay will be annexed into Argentina and a military government will be placed in charge of the region until further notice."
southern.10.a:0 "Cede the Chaco Boreal to Bolivia."
southern.10.b:0 "All of Paraguay belongs to us!"

southern.11.t:0 "Argentina refuses to cede Chaco Boreal"
southern.11.d:0 "Even though we carried their pathetic force through the bloody war, the Argentinians have the guts to refuse to return the Chaco Boreal to its rightful owner. Our populace is rightfully furious and is clamouring the government to press our claims, by war if necessary."
southern.11.a:0 "Death to Argentina!"
southern.11.b:0 "They do have a bigger army..."

## Foreign ##
argfor.100.t:0 "Argentina Offers a Pact"

argfor.1.t:0 "Buenos Aires-Lima Pact"

argfor.4.t:0 "Argentina Requests Assistance"
argfor.4.d:0 "Locked in an inevitable confrontation with the FOP in Patagonia, Argentina is dedicated to purging the red threat from the continent as quickly as possible. To achieve this, they have come knocking on our door to ask for assistance in the fight as Chile is set to intervene on the behalf of the FOP. This gives us the opportunity to take back the coastline we so desire and put the Chilean people in their place. Frictions with Argentina, however, aren't fully resolved yet and the Yacuiba region could be used an argument should we no longer be an asset to Argentinean Expansion."
argfor.4.a:0 "Agree to assist."
argfor.4.b:0 "Refuse the offer."

argfor.5.t:0 "Bolivia Intervenes!"

argfor.7.t:0 "Volunteers to Rome"
argfor.7.d:0 "The Holy See is under siege by the most decrepit human beings on the planet, the godless socialists of the Internationale. All that now stands against the red tide is the brave Papal garrison and their Italian ally. Thousands of young Argentinean men, however, have expressed their support for the Pope and are leaving our shores to fight the evil abroad. The Government has not yet made a clear statement regarding the situation but has seen its hand forced if it wants to keep the furious masses under control."
argfor.7.a:0 "Allow the Volunteers to fight."
argfor.7.b:0 "Organise a propaganda campaign to rouse the masses in favour of the Pope."

argfor.8.t:0 "Argentinean Volunteers Arrive in Rome"

argfor.9.t:0 "Argentina Wants to Join the Reichspakt"

argfor.9.b:0 "We don't need their help."

argfor.91.t:0 "Argentina Wants to Join the Reichspakt"

argfor.11.t:0 "Germany Refuses Our Offer"

argfor.12.t:0 "Immigrants from the United States"
argfor.12.d:0 "As their homeland devolves in civil war and thousands die on the streets of the once great American nation for a defunct ideology, swarms of refugees from the States have departed from the East Coast setting sail for our nation. For years we have upheld a policy of open immigration and have actively attracted foreigners. Accepting refugees from the USA, however, could have unforeseen diplomatic implications and the rate at which they keep flowing in is putting a strain on our nation."
argfor.12.a:0 "Increase fees for entry."

argbla.1.d:0 "When the German market opened this morning and the stocks suddenly started plummeting, our nation was one of the first to be hit by the wave. In response to the Berlin stock exchange, the Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires collapsed as well causing even more trouble for Carlés who is barely holding on to power."
argbla.1.a:0 "Argentina is thrown into a spiral of bad luck!"

argbla.2.t:0 "Closure of the Bolsa de Comercio?"
argbla.2.d:0 "With stocks continuing to plummet and investors all around the nation panicking, we could close the stock exchange and demand the banks to refuse to pay out desperate citizens. This will buy us some more time to fix the disaster while we are focusing on political affairs. However, the population will surely not be appreciate this"
argbla.2.a:0 "Close it!"
argbla.2.b:0 "The free market will fix this!"

argbla.3.t:0 "Close the Currency Board?"
argbla.3.d:0 "For most of our history, the currency board has tied the Peso to a gold standard where an organ called the Caja de Conversión was tasked with maintaining the value of our currency. With stocks plummeting and Germany taking decisive action to soften the blow, our exports have lost their competitive edge and are going to be struggling to compete with cheap Eastern European and domestic German products. Therefore, a proposal was offered to close the currency board and abandon the gold standard, letting the peso devaluate and making our products therefore competitive again."
argbla.3.a:0 "Close the board."
argbla.3.b:0 "Keep the board open."

argbla.31.t:0 "Exports Are Collapsing"
argbla.31.d:0 "Due to increasing competition from Europe and other parts of the world, our products have completely lost their competitive edge on the German market causing thousands of our citizens to lose their jobs due to the bankruptcy of many of our major companies."
argbla.31.a:0 "Try to soften the blow."

argbla.4.t:0 "Peso Spirals Downwards"
argbla.4.d:0 "With political insecurity in Argentina and massive economic troubles in the German Empire, the Peso keeps spiralling downwards forcing many of our old and powerful companies to close down and lay off thousands of workers. Government plans to intervene and save those without jobs are being drafted up but in the meantime, the situation goes from bad to worse."
argbla.4.a:0 "Strong intervention is a necessity!"

argbla.5.t:0 "Unrest in Cordoba and Mendoza"
argbla.5.d:0 "Caused by the economic recession and feeding off the political insecurity in our nation, thousands of jobless citizens in the industrial cities of Cordoba and Mendoza have flocked to the streets to demand the government to step in and fix the crisis. Since our control over these cities is still uncontested, local police forces loyal to the army are not intervening on our behalf in an attempt to fan the flames of resistance against the regime."
argbla.5.a:0 "Send a strongly worded letter."

argbla.6.t:0 "Revising Our Exports"
argbla.6.d:0 "After the victory by the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg and the fading importance of the British Empire, Argentina slowly started adjusting itself to the new world order and increased its exports to Germany. This turned out to be the correct choice as 1925 brought with it the collapse of the British Empire and the trade network it had established. As Argentina's prime export partner and the supplier of much of our needed goods, the government was forced to start a large scale industrialisation program leading to rising social tensions and a couple rough years.\n\nGerman investments and the increasing importance of our agricultural products turned the situation back around in the thirties, leading to an economic boom and the establishment of Argentina as an economic powerhouse on the continent. The crash of the German market however and the return of protectionism to the nation, have catastrophically impacted our economy and severely hampered our exports. A new trade agreement will have to be signed so we can get a guarantee from the German Empire that they'll keep importing our goods."
argbla.6.a:0 "Send the proposal."

argbla.7.t:0 "Argentinean Trade Delegation"
argbla.7.d:0 "As one of our largest import partners, the struggling republic of Argentina has reached out to our trade ministry begging us to make an exception on the increased tariffs we imposed on non-Mitteleuropean nations. Since their economy is virtually entirely dependent on us, we could put the squeeze on them and try to force them into signing a less favourable agreement.\n\nShould they, however, take this opportunity to shift their interests to the Entente, it would cut us off from their vital agricultural exports which could give our rivals in the Entente an advantage in the Americas."
argbla.7.a:0 "We need their loyalty!"
argbla.7.b:0 "What's a few extra Marks between friends?"

argbla.71.t:0 "Germany Agrees to Our Terms"
argbla.71.d:0 "Whether it is out of benevolence or a desire to expand their influence on the South American continent, Germany has eagerly agreed to our terms and made an exception for Argentinean products in their Black Monday trade arrangements."
argbla.71.a:0 "We are grateful."

argbla.72.t:0 "Germany Imposes Harsher Terms"
argbla.72.d:0 "Aware of our fragile situation and not willing to drag their own recovery down to assist us, the German trade ministry has demanded we lower the prices of our processed meat exports or face consequences by receiving higher prices on steel, tools and consumer goods.\n\nWe are, however, not obliged to follow these demands and could perhaps strike a deal with the Entente to reduce our dependence on Germany, although the Islas Malvinas issue has not fully been resolved yet and could prove to be a British bargaining chip."
argbla.72.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
argbla.72.b:0 "Maybe there is an alternative solution..."

argbla.73.t:0 "Argentina Comes to Bargain"
argbla.73.d:0 "Severely hit by Black Monday and forced by Germany to swallow a tough pill to save their economy, the government has come to us to strike a new trade agreement. Their vast agrarian exports have made them a key player on the global market and years of industrialisation after the fall of our empire have successfully turned them into a valuable asset for our trade network and possibly alliance.\n\nHowever, they also stole the Falkland Islands in our moment of weakness and this is an insult that doesn't sit well with the public at home. Should we force them to return the islands we would gain a massive amount of support from our followers but could risk an end to possible trade relations with the Republic."
argbla.73.a:0 "We can use all the help we can get."
argbla.73.b:0 "The Falkland Islands are British!"

argbla.74.t:0 "Canada Accepts Our Proposal"
argbla.74.d:0 "Whether it is out of benevolence or a desire to expand their influence on the South American continent, Canada has eagerly agreed to our terms and made an exception for Argentinean products in their trade arrangements, giving us access to a worldwide market of opportunity."
argbla.74.a:0 "We are grateful."

argbla.75.t:0 "Canada Demands the Falkland Islands Back"
argbla.75.d:0 "While Canada would be willing to revise their broken treaties with us after the 1925 debacle, they have one simple demand before agreeing to discuss possible trade arrangements: The Islas Malvinas have to be returned to British control at once or there will be no possible deal, now or in the future. Not only are the islands an important naval facility in our fight against the FOP, returning the islands would cause massive outrage on the home front which we don't need with the already fragile state of our regime.\n\nInhabitants of the Islands have not been asked whose side they are on but it goes without saying that they have full faith in our capacity to make the right decision."
argbla.75.a:0 "On second thought, the Germans weren't so bad..."
argbla.75.b:0 "Who cares about some sheep rocks anyway?"

argbla.76.t:0 "Argentina Accepts Our Demands!"
argbla.76.d:0 "Realising that they have no other choice but to bow to our demands, the Argentinean government has officially signed the new trade agreement granting us even more influence in their nation and improved relations with their trade board. Our steel, consumer goods and other modern appliances will be imported at high prices while we cheaply import their canned food."
argbla.76.a:0 "A great deal."

argbla.8.t:0 "Introduction of the Empréstito Patriótico"
argbla.8.d:0 "As our recovery attempts have only proven mildly successful and the economy is still failing, the government has announced the 'empréstito patriótico' or patriotic loan to strengthen the coffers. The first of these new tariffs is to be imposed on gasoline with the profits being directed to the Dirección Nacional de Vialidad, or the National Office of Public Highways."
argbla.8.a:0 "The proposal goes into effect!"
argbla.8.b:0 "We can't force our people to cough up even more money!"

argbla.9.t:0 "Creation of La Junta Nacional de Granos"
argbla.9.d:0 "Operating as our National Grain Board, the JNG will buy wheat, flax and corn from our struggling farmers for prices established by our government. Through this panel, we can secure a fair price for our farmers while backing them up when we are again hit by a recession using the means of the Exchange Fund of the Banco de la Nación.\n\nSome in the government, however, would prefer expanding the panel drastically and also secure prices for Industrial and all Agrarian goods. Liberals, however, see this as a direct attack on the Free Market and are urging the government to stop with these policies before it is too late."
argbla.9.a:0 "The Board will regulate all goods!"
argbla.9.b:0 "Only Agrarian products will be dealt with."
argbla.9.c:0 "Block the Proposal!"

argbla.10.t:0 "Stabilisation in the Countryside"
argbla.10.d:0 "Due to our decisive actions in the early days of the recession and primarily due to the successes of the JNG, a large portion of our farmers has been able to escape from bankruptcy. Now that trade is once again increasing, our farms are in excellent shape, and large shipments of food are already being sent to Canada and the German Empire."

argbla.10.b:0 "Very well."

argbla.11.t:0 "La Viña Dam Construction Project"
argbla.11.d:0 "To further boost the industrialisation process of Cordoba, governor Amadeo Sabattini has proposed the creation of a large hydro-electric installation to not only power the nascent industry of the region but also provide irrigation for thousands of acres of agricultural land, the main economic motor of the province. Construction is planned to take at least 5 years but with sufficient government backing this could perhaps be reduced albeit at a high cost."
argbla.11.a:0 "Allocate Funds."
argbla.11.b:0 "We can't spare the resources."

argbla.12.t:0 "Escuela de Aviación Militar de Argentina Opening"
argbla.12.d:0 "Founded on August 10, 1912, under the administration of Roque Sáenz Peña, the Military Aviation School was created to accommodate the rising importance of aviation and to train and subsidize Argentina's first generation of pilots. Due to the ever-increasing importance of aviation and its introduction in military warfare during the Weltkrieg, expansions were agreed upon in 1934 to build a new headquarters for our aeronautical school. Located on the outskirts of Cordoba, the school is destined to educate the next generation of pilots and give us an edge over our neighbours."
argbla.12.a:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has opened the academy!"

argbla.13.t:0 "Buenos Aires Underground Expands!"
argbla.13.d:0 "Originally opened in 1913, the Buenos Aires underground was the first metro system on the South American continent and even in the entire Southern Hemisphere. Under a near monopoly of the AATC, little expansion was done in the last decades prompting the government to step in and transfer construction rights to the Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF). They went on to create a new line for the system, the Line D connecting Catedral to Tribunales.\n\nContinued emigration to the city from the impoverished countryside and the massive influx of European immigrants has left our public transportation system severely lacking which has led to the government proposal to nationalise the network into the Transport Corporation of Buenos Aires (CTCBA) to allow for better expansion and to meet the demands created by the population explosion of the city."
argbla.13.a:0 "Nationalise the Underground!"
argbla.13.b:0 "The Free Market should not be hampered!"

argbla.14.t:0 "La Bombonera Opens!"
argbla.14.d:0 "Previous to La Bombonera, the football club 'Boca Juniors' had used several locations before settling on their current ground on Brandsen. Club's first ground had been located in Dársena Sur of the old Buenos Aires port (currently Puerto Madero) and Isla Demarchi before moving to Brandsen and Del Crucero streets in 1924.\n\nIn 1931, the Boca Juniors' steering committee (led by president Ruperto Molfino) acquired the lands from the Municipality of Buenos Aires for A$$ 2,200,000. Three years later the club published a call for tenders to build its new stadium. Economic hardship due to the Black Monday disaster and the inability to find proper architects delayed the construction of the new stadium until 1938 when the club played their last match before the great work began.\n\nFinally opening on May 25, 1940, with a friendly match between Boca and San Lorenzo, the home side won 2-0 with both goals scored by Ricardo Alarcón. Even though the station was freshly built, it lacked a lighting system which forced the game to end by the 70th minute."

argbla.15.d:0 "Awoken at 7.11 AM this morning, the people of San Juan were rocked out of their beds by an earthquake in the eastern departments of the San Juan province. Two deaths have already been accounted for but many more could still be trapped in the rubble. Reported as a 6.2 on the Richter scale, authorities are happy to report that damage is minimal and a greater tragedy was avoided due to the location of the epicentre."

## 1936 Carles ##
argcar.1.t:0 "Status of Argentina"
argcar.1.d:0 "By the early 20th century, Argentina was enjoying a booming and fast-growing economic prowess based on its meat and cereal exports. Immigrants from all over Europe flooded towards the Republic and vigorous entrepreneurship and a nascent industry quickly propelled Argentina forwards as one of the most prosperous nations on the planet. Trade relations were secure and exports to the United Kingdom and Germany kept increasing.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg however struck, Argentina was forced into neutrality unwilling to side with either its most important economic partner, the UK, or its second most important one, Germany. By steering between the two, sanctions were brought down by the British, enforcing an embargo on trade with Germany. While Argentina tried circumventing this by selling through third countries, the sales were not the same and the pre-WK miracle slowed down.\n\nAs the last years of the Weltkrieg approached, it became apparent to the UK that it was fighting a losing fight and ordered the Argentinean government and companies to ramp up production and exploit the nation to the fullest. Discontent with the increased demands and sick of British exploitation, the workers started to organise, protest and finally rise up in an armed revolt. Unable to fully contain the situation, the control of the Argentinean government on the uprisings went from bad to worse and by the mid-20s Argentina had lost control of Santa Cruz, Chubut and Rio Negro Provinces to the newly formed Frente Obrero Patagonico.\n\nThree subsequent democratically elected governments were tasked with solving the crisis but failed one after another. In response to their incapacity to rule, General Uriburu rose up in 1930 to attempt crushing the revolt. A reign of terror spread across the nation with socialist and syndicalist sympathisers massacred and pushed southwards. His dictatorship is however short lived as he dies from cancer two years later, forming a power vacuum and once more no large-scale intervention in the South."
argcar.1.a:0 "Very well."

argcar.100.d:0 "Elections are written out and through electoral fraud, the PAN under Roca successfully takes power, prompting a slow recovery from Uriburu's dictatorship and a changing attitude towards the FOP (Patagonian Workers Front). Small skirmishes into FOP territory are launched and the navy successfully retakes the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. Intervention from Chile, however, stops the government from achieving victory and temporarily ends the conflict with the FOP.\n\nWhen in 1935, rumours started surfacing that Roca may be attempting to end the conflict and leave the FOP alone, outrage across the nation erupts, enabling the Liga Patriotica under Manuel Carlés to gain the support they need - culminating in the Christmas Coup. Supported by the Navy and various military elements, Carlés coups the government on Christmas 1935, takes control over the capital region, and starts solidifying his hold on the nation.\n\nOn the first of January 1936, Carlés is still in the midst of his attempted coup - with success far from certain. Aside from the Buenos Aires capital region and a few small inland provinces, his control is nihil. Support from the ARA or 'Argentinean Armada' is guaranteed, but many of the military commanders in the Army doubt Carlés' potential and are organising to put down his coup."

argcar.2.t:0 "Clashes at the Colegio Militar de la Nación"
argcar.2.d:0 "As one of the last strongholds in the greater Buenos Aires region, the Colegio Militar de la Nación was occupied by loyalist members of the military who had barricaded themselves inside the compound awaiting reinforcements from the interior. In response to this last-ditch effort, soldiers of the ARA were sent in to try and push them out. While small clashes occurred throughout the compound, the Army surrendered a week later when their basic utilities and will to hold out had started to fade.\n\nAmongst the captured were a few notable Army commanders but it seems that the majority of the staff had fled the city during the first days of the Coup. This victory may be insignificant in the greater picture but we now firmly control the entirety of Buenos Aires."
argcar.2.a:0 "Incarcerate the officers."
argcar.2.b:0 "Execute the dissidents."

argcar.3.t:0 "Fight for the Estación Retiro"
argcar.3.d:0 "As the primary railway hub of our nation, the city of Buenos Aires plays a key role in connecting the vast swathes of land of our country. Most of the Northern railroads, however, pass through Rosario, which has not yet declared its allegiance to Carlés and may prove a thorn in our side during the Northern campaign. Our troops are currently finishing up the loyalist remnants in the Estación Retiro in Buenos Aires but we will have to decide whether we have the ARA secure the coastline and its populous cities or the Rosario hub first."
argcar.3.a:0 "Push towards Rosario."
argcar.3.b:0 "Send the ARA to Mar del Plata."

argcar.4.t:0 "Gendarmería Nacional Argentina"
argcar.4.d:0 "With questionable support from the army and the limited manpower of the ARA, a debate has arisen about the capabilities of our internal strike force. According to the Argentinean Constitution, the armed forces can technically not intervene in internal civil conflicts, so the Gendarmerie would be created as an organ subordinate to the Defence Ministry and thus the Carlés cabinet. It would be defined as a civilian "security force of a military nature" and maintain a functional relationship with the Ministry of Defence, as part of both the National Defence System and the Interior Security System. It would, therefore, maintain capabilities arising from the demands required by joint military planning with the armed forces and would legally be able to intervene in the current crisis.\n\nOur funds are, however, limited at this time and the loyalty of the new recruits would be questionable at best which has made Carlés reconsider the proposal to avoid the possibility of a counter-coup from within his own ranks."
argcar.4.a:0 "Found the GNA."
argcar.4.b:0 "We can deal with the situation on our own."

argcar.5.t:0 "Intervention in the Judiciary branch"
argcar.5.d:0 "During the early years of the twentieth century, our nation started to slowly move away from the old authoritarian systems towards a more open and democratic system by changes to the constitution and the implementation of checks and balances. The subsequent separatism in Patagonia, the continued corruption in government and the shady dealings of the conservative ruling party, however, have stumped our progress and kept the old system alive and striving. Not only has this led to great disgruntlement amongst the people, it has also created a hotbed for Carlés supporters who claim the High Court is obstructing "popular will".\n\nWith Carlés and his supporters now in control of the High Court, it has given him the perfect opportunity to strike the defunct system by relieving all 5 members of the Court from their duties and to replace them by his "men of the people". We can, however, further push our narrative and start replacing the lower courts as well with our followers, although this might backfire greatly should the people turn sides."
argcar.5.a:0 "The old system is outdated and corrupt!"
argcar.5.b:0 "Only replace the High Court."

argcar.50.t:0 "Question of Civil Rights"
argcar.50.d:0 "Many of our supporters are convinced that we aren't rooting out the old guard efficiently enough and have pushed for a temporary restriction on the constitutional rights of our citizens. This proposal is of course not going to be well accepted by the majority of the population but could guarantee a safer homefront and avoid political or civilian opposition."
argcar.50.a:0 "All Argentinians must serve the state in these times."
argcar.50.b:0 "The constitution grants rights that cannot be taken."

argcar.51.t:0 "Protests in Buenos Aires"
argcar.51.d:0 "As a reaction to our decision to temporarily lift the constitution to pursue the dissenters, thousands of our citizens have flocked to the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires to protest against these changes and proclaim their support for the old government. While this doesn't come as a surprise, we hadn't expected the protests to rise up this quickly. This puts a serious dent in the plans to secure the Argentinean hinterland and could potentially buy the conservative forces the time they need to form an organised opposition."
argcar.51.a:0 "Send in the Gendarmería."
argcar.51.b:0 "Station the reserves in Buenos Aires."

argcar.52.t:0 "Escalation in Buenos Aires"
argcar.52.d:0 "The protests in the capital suddenly turned violent when the armed forces were sent in with stones being thrown at our riot forces. An unskilled rookie opened fire on the protestors in response causing the whole situation to explode in a bloody mess where dozens of civilians were shot in an effort to control the crowd. The hard crackdown inevitably led to the dispersion of the crowds and dozens of arrests but has shown the weakness of the Carlés regime in quelling these protests."
argcar.52.a:0 "A dark day for Argentina."

argcar.6.t:0 "Cordoba and Rosario Denounce the Carlés Regime"
argcar.6.d:0 "Strongly influenced by the army and the remnants of socialists that haven't fled southwards, the cities of Cordoba and Rosario have declared the government in Buenos Aires incapable of ruling Argentina and have cut all ties with the capital region and urge the other states to follow suit. Conservative members of the Army have announced their support for the movement and are establishing defensive positions around Rosario to counter our forces."

An intervention force shall be sent to the province to restore order and to arrest all contra revolutionaries that are refusing to accept rule from Buenos Aires."
argcar.61.a:0 "Start the campaign."

argcar.7.t:0 "Mendoza and Entre Rios Side with Cordoba"
argcar.7.d:0 "Following the example of Cordoba, the states of Mendoza and Entre Rios have also denounced Carlés and taken the side of the military. While this is a devastating blow to our legitimacy and power in the outer provinces, the Army is still too disorganised to actively pursue us."
argcar.7.a:0 "We must move quickly now."

argcar.8.t:0 "Capture of Mar del Plata"
argcar.8.d:0 "As the ARA approached the coastline of Mar del Plata and launched a warning salvo to deter any military presence in the city from fighting back, the city officially surrendered to admiral Videla at 12 am. The large city known for his beaches to the Argentinean elite has experienced an economic boom these last few years and has now wisely decided to stay out of the conflict to prevent damage to its citizens or buildings."

argcar.9.d:0 "Insurgents from the city of Rosario have sabotaged the railway connection to the capital in an effort to slow our forces down and buy them more time to organise against us. Especially the station of San Nicolas was hit hard and has caused much of our planned movements to become impossible to achieve. The fall of momentum in our movement and the rising threat of an organised military opposition to Carlés has forced us to reconsider other options. The Grupo de Oficiales Unidos holds vast control over the Army and has not yet chosen with whom to side with which could make them a valuable asset in our struggle. Convincing them will not be easy though as they are set to play an influential role in politics and might even directly interfere in our policies both abroad and on the home front."

argcar.94.t:0 "Confrontation in Rosario"
argcar.94.d:0 "After a painful campaign through the countryside to reach the city, plagued by sabotage and insurgent opposition, the Carlés forces finally reached Rosario. Fully entrenched, well supplied and with strategic support from the GOU, the city was prepared against any offensive which was proven when the initial attempts to take the city were snuffed out quickly and efficiently. The Panzers that were brought in from Buenos Aires to support the assailants proved to be ineffective in the small streets of the city and skirmishes in the Villa Diego and Saladillo quickly became disasters for the attackers. By the end of the 10-day struggle for the city, supplies and morale of the Carlés forces ran out and the commanding officer formally surrendered to the GOU effectively ending the fight for Rosario and by extension the campaign to pacify the hinterlands."

argcar.95.t:0 "Fall of Buenos Aires"
argcar.95.d:0 "With the majority of the armed supporters of Carlés defeated and captured after the disastrous Rosario campaign, the Army and GOU forces shifted their focus to a quick knock-out of the capital to depose Carlés and re-secure Argentina. Thousands of troops loyal to the Army were sent to the capital where the limited forces of Carlés proved to be no match for their superior counterparts. Last spots of resistance throughout the city still roar but the great leader has already taken his life to avoid capture and punishment for his deeds."

With the signature of both parties, the internal conflict has effectively ended. Pedro Pablo Ramírez has taken up the task to rebuild the nation and has declared elections to be held in September to decide the future of Argentina."

Troops are being sent by train to Rosario to quell the revolt and are expected to arrive there before the Army has a chance to prepare its defences, giving us the opportunity to take the populous city."
argcar.10.a:0 "Onwards we go!"

argcar.11.t:0 "Fall of Rosario"
argcar.11.d:0 "Surprised by the quick reaction of our troops and ill-prepared to take on our forces, the city fell after only small skirmishes in the centre of the city. While not much of the rebel leadership was captured in the attack, the moral implications of the victory are great, prompting Mar Del Plata and Concordia to immediately surrender to the central government. They are also fear retaliation should they side with the rebels. Material damage to the city is fairly limited due to the excellent reaction of our troops but the important railway hub that we hoped to capture was bombed just before our arrival to prevent us from quickly taking the other cities."

argcar.12.t:0 "The Carlés Cabinet"
argcar.12.d:0 "To confirm his victory in securing the nation, Manuel Carlés has announced his cabinet picks this morning in Buenos Aires. As his minister of Foreign Affairs, he has chosen the infamous Estanislao Zeballos whose literary works have had a profound impact on our nation and whose loyalty to the LP goes without question. Diego Isidro Masón has been chosen to serve as minister of economic affairs due to his close ties with the rest of the armed forces and to personally oversee the rapid militarisation of the Argentinean war machine. As the minister of Interior Affairs, Carlés has chosen another military man in the form of Elbio Anaya who has played an important role in the first days of the Patagonia rebellion but was unable to complete his task due to the failures of his superior Colonel Héctor Benigno Varela."

argcar.20.d:0 "With a deal struck between Carlés and the GOU, the latter has committed troops to our Rosario campaign and has even commanded the troops loyal to them to stand down in Rosario and turn on their comrades in the Army. Attacked both by the Panzers brought in from Buenos Aires and the traitors from within, the city could not stand up to the combined forces and surrendered formally to Pedro Pablo Ramírez, head of the GOU, this evening."
argcar.20.a:0 "A great victory for the nation."

argcar.21.t:0 "GOU Calls Carlés to Order"
argcar.21.d:0 "Even though victory has been secured over Chile and the rebels in Patagonia have been crushed, Carlés is still not satisfied with the territorial expansion of our nation and further campaigns into Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia are all being drawn up and sent to the army. Being allied to Carlés during the early days of his regime, the GOU has politely requested Carlés to tone down his recklessness before he drags Argentina down with him. Controlling vast parts of our armed forces, we cannot risk angering the GOU as they could lift us from power just as easily as they helped us seize it so we will either have to bow to their request and stop with the campaign or take the radical approach of removing the organisation from power with force."

argcar.22.t:0 "Coup of [GetYear]"
argcar.22.d:0 "Unforeseen by Carlés, this morning he was awoken by the marching boots of 8000 Argentinean soldiers who had gathered on the Plaza de Mayo. Organised by members of the GOU, General Ramírez took up the lead of the coup, quickly organising their forces to seize key locations in the city before Carlés could react. With the majority of the loyalist soldiers on the borders planning the next offensive, little to no troops were left in the Buenos Aires region leading to a quick and decisive strike on government facilities. Upon arriving at the Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics in the neighbourhood of Núñez, the group was attacked by loyal forces who were entrenched there, resulting in the death of 30 and the wounding of 100 but ultimately the surrender of the ARA forces.\n\nHaving surrendered the Navy School of Mechanics, the remaining Argentinean generals received the rebel leaders and declared Ramírez president of the Republic by noon. Carlés, while able to escape the rebel troops, boarded a small fishing trawler and set off to Peru in the hopes of finding an ally in their regime."
argcar.22.a:0 "Long live President Ramírez!"

argcar.23.t:0 "Carlés Arrives in Peru"
argcar.23.d:0 "Successfully arriving in Peru after he was ousted only last week, Carlés has been able to secure temporary asylum in the nation whilst Peru decides on an official response. While his trial is being prepared in Buenos Aires, President Ramírez has officially requested his extradition from Peru. Accused of High Treason, corruption and other crimes against the Argentinean State, it is fairly clear that his extradition would lead to an immediate incarceration and the end of his political career."
argcar.23.a:0 "Request his extradition from the Peruvian embassy."

argcar.24.t:0 "Argentina Demands the Extradition of Carlés"
argcar.24.d:0 "During the successful Coup in Argentina last week, Carlés was forced to flee the nation and has requested asylum from us. While we have temporarily granted his request while we await the return of stability to Argentina, President Ramírez has now demanded his immediate extradition so he can be persecuted for his crimes. Carlés has always been a strong ally of our Peruvian government and it is as of now still unclear whether Ramírez will follow the same foreign policy although sending Carlés back could secure good relations with the new regime."

argcar.25.d:0 "Fearing possible diplomatic retaliation from Argentina, the Peruvian government has accepted our demand and put Carlés in custody and ready to be transferred back to Buenos Aires where his trial will commence shortly. While his persecution will not be the last of our troubles dealing with his supporters, it will send a clear message to those that still remain in both the army and government institutions."
argcar.25.a:0 "The Trial starts in 2 months."

argcar.26.t:0 "Peru Refuses Our Demand"
argcar.26.d:0 "Unwilling to comply with our demands to extradite Carlés, the Peruvian government has decided to grant him full political asylum. Ramírez has answered with the forced expulsion of Peruvian diplomats from Buenos Aires and has threatened Peru with economic sanctions should they not comply with our demands. Many experts believe that Peru will cave into this response quickly based on the built-up Chilean war friendship and the reliance on Argentinean exports but others see this as a chance for Peru to prove that it can stand on its own against foreign aggression."

Liborio Justo, son of the General and Chief of Staff Agustin P. Justo, had fled to the Frente Obrero Patagonico in 1930, taking with him many military manuals from El Palomar, and helping make the FOP's military stronger. Accused of treason, some judges had suggested the death penalty and that's where General Agustin P. Justo decided to intervene. Arguing against the execution, Justo is coming off to the public as a voice of reason, critizicing the government for being overly harsh and potentially inspiring yet another uprising. While passing the guilty sentence is still on the table, many on the cabinet are well aware of Agustin P. Justo's deep connections into both the Army and the UCRA, and advise us to treat the matter with precaution."

argcar.31.t:0 "Crackdown on the FOIC"
argcar.31.d:0 "The Federación Obrera de la Industria de la Carne or Meat Industry Workers Federation has been banned by presidential decree this morning leading to the closure of the FOIC offices in Berrios and Avellaneda and the subsequent arrestation of the leadership, most notably Secretary General José Peter.\n\nThe organisation has been closely linked to syndicalist cells in our nation but were mostly unharmed by the previous administration after previous strikes organised by them led to a dangerous economic crisis in the meat packing industry. An organised reaction against this move and strikes across the nation are to be expected but are necessary to avoid the red menace from taking control."
argcar.31.a:0 "We can not let syndicalism overtake our nation!"

argcar.32.t:0 "Dissolution of the CGT"
argcar.32.d:0 "Following the persecution of the FOIC, the Confederación General del Trabajo de la República Argentina or General Confederation of Labour of the Argentinean Republic has now also been dissolved by Ramírez in his pledge to eradicate all socialist elements in the nation and remove the basis of organised resistance. Centred mostly around the railroads and having experienced a split due to the conflict in the FOP, the CGT has slowly started to establish itself as the largest union of our nation.\n\nWith their dissolution, the socialists once again lose an important pillar of their power. The more than 100.000 members of the organisation though are sure to organise resistance and with the already rising tensions between the unions and the government due to the Black Monday disaster, this move could be very dangerous to the stability of our nation."
argcar.32.a:0 "Push for further regularisation of the unions."

argcar.33.t:0 "The Government Takes over the Littoral"
argcar.33.d:0 "In line with the political agenda of Ramírez, the management of education has been handed over to the right-wing Hispanic-Catholic nationalists. By a decisive action by the government, the National University of the Littoral was seized and Jordán Bruno Genta instated as its supervisor. Genta, known for his far-right and anti-reformist ideas, maintains that the country needs to create "an intelligent aristocracy, nourished by Roman and Hispanic lineage" to lead the nation to greatness.\n\nThe University Federation of the Littoral responded vehemently against the appointment of Genta calling it a violation of the 1918 university act which guaranteed governing autonomy and academic freedom. Government forces immediately responded to these accusations by detaining its secretary general and expelling students and professors who protested in opposition."
argcar.33.a:0 "All institutions must be controlled."

argcar.34.t:0 "General Strike!"
argcar.34.d:0 "Organised by FOIC cadres after mass meetings in Rosario, Avellaneda and Berrios, a strike petition was issued calling for the liberation of Peter and the demand for 30 hours of guaranteed work a week. The management of the meat industry refused these terms and in response, a general strike was called throughout the nation paralysing the vital sector. Gendarmería had been sent in to quell the strikers and force them back to work but clashes between government forces and protesters quickly escalated, leading to hard oppression by the police forces and the arrestation of dozens of strikers.\n\nPersonal intervention however by Perón has made the Unions and management come to a fragile agreement followed by the release of Peter to calm the masses down. Part of these negotiations, however, led to the new Autonomous Butcher's Union of Berisso and Ensenada, in open opposition to the FOIC."
argcar.34.a:0 "This Colonel seems to know what he's doing."

argcar.35.t:0 "Second FOIC Crackdown"
argcar.35.d:0 "Due to reinvigorated issues between the management and the union concerning meeting the new economic demands, negotiations once again broke down which has prompted us to immediately seize the offices of the FOIC again and the further arrestation of key FOIC figures amongst whom Peter who was just released. With this action, the Union has been near completely destroyed. Lack of funds, the loss of their leadership and the planned deportation of their leader Peter have made the organisation dissolve giving room to new unions, preferably ours, to expand and take their territory."
argcar.35.a:0 "Slowly but surely our grasp becomes more secure."

argcar.36.t:0 "Ramírez Takes over the Railway Unions"
argcar.36.d:0 "Even though the Unions have been legalised now by Ramírez, a clause was included which lets the government take over any union at will. The powerful railroad union, which formed the foundation of the CGT was the first to fall under this new policy and has been placed under direct government control. A so-called "inventor" has been placed in the organisation as the supervisor but is more a direct extension of the government than an independent agent.\n\nStrikes against this move almost immediately followed but were put down hard by the Gendarmería who have arrested dozens more influential socialist leaders. The Unions, however, have started to change direction sensing that the new government is heavily anti-union and therefore a group under Ángel Borlenghi has approached Colonel Domingo Mercante to sit down and come to a peaceful resolution."
argcar.36.a:0 "Mercante accepts the offer."

argcar.37.t:0 "Mercante and the Unions reach an accord"
argcar.37.d:0 "Represented by Ángel Borlenghi, Francisco Pablo Capozzi and Juan Atilio Bramuglia, the Unions opted, albeit with reservations and distrust, to establish relations with a sector of the military government more inclined to accept union demands, with the aim of forming an alliance capable of influencing the course of events. To achieve initial contact with the military they chose Colonel Domingo Mercante, the son of an important railroad union leader and member of the GOU, to represent the government and hopefully persuade him to listen to the Unions. In turn, Mercante summoned his political partner and close friend, Juan Perón, a colonel and member of the GOU.\n\nWhile the negotiations were tough, the proposal of the Unions that the military created a Secretariat of Labour, strengthen a now loyal CGT and sanction a series of labour laws that would accept the historical claims of the Argentinean labour movement was positively received by the colonels. They, however, demanded the immediate release of Peter, who was imprisoned earlier this year when the army rolled up the FOIC."
argcar.37.a:0 "Finally something we can work with."

argcar.38.t:0 "Secretary of Labour Perón"
argcar.38.d:0 "After his success to broker a deal between the unions and the military government, Perón was granted the office of Head of the Department of Labour. A completely empty position with no power, we hoped this would keep the ambitious colonel busy and blocked from any further rise in politics. He however successfully fulfilled the office and even gave it a new meaning by approving the labour laws that had been claimed historically by the Argentinean labour movement (extending the severance indemnity that existed since 1934 for commerce employees, pensions for commerce employees, a multi-clinic hospital for railway workers, technical schools for workers, the prohibition of employment agencies, the creation of the labour courts, Christmas bonuses), lending efficacy to the existing labour inspectors and impelling for the first time collective bargaining, which grew to become the basic way of regulating the relationship between capital and labour. Moreover, he forced us to drop the decree regarding unions associations sanctioned by president Ramírez in the first weeks of the revolution, which was criticised by the entire labour movement.\n\nIn addition, Perón, Mercante, and the initial group of unionists who formed the alliance began to organize a new union that would assume a nationalist-labour identity. The group assumed an anti-syndicalist position already existing in parts of the old CGT and, relying on the power of the Secretary of Labour, organized new unions in the industries which lacked them (chemicals, electricity, tobacco) and set up rival unions in industries with powerful old and hostile to the government, unions (meat, construction, textiles, metallurgy)."

Ramírez, unwilling to back down now and risk the anger of German diplomats has not yet taken a decision but must do so quickly if he wishes to remain in power.

An unfamiliar social class, which had remained completely absent from Argentinean history until then, burst into Buenos Aires and demanded Perón's freedom. The city was taken by tens of thousands of workers from the industrial areas that had been growing on the outskirts of the city. The crowd set itself up in the Plaza de Mayo and refused to leave until their demands were met. It was characterized by the large number of young people and especially women who were part of it, and by the predominance of people with hair and skin darker than those who attended the traditional political acts of the time. The anti-Peronist opposition stressed these differences, referring to them in derogatory terms such as "blacks", "fat people", " descamisados (shirtless)", "cabecitas negras". It was the Radical Unionist leader Sammartino who even went so far as to call the event a "zoo flood".\n\nThe protestors were accompanied by a whole new generation of young people and new union delegates belonging to the unions of the CGT, which had responded to a sugar workers' strike two days earlier. It was a completely peaceful demonstration, but the political and cultural upheaval was of such heft that, in a few hours, the triumph of the anti-Peronist movement had been cancelled out, as did the remaining power of the military government.\n\nAfter intense negotiations, the radical Armando Antille distinguished himself as Perón's delegate leading to his liberation.

argdem.8.t:0 "Negotiations with the FOP"
argdem.8.d:0 "Eager to solve the FOP debacle without further bloodshed and with the mandate of the people, the Argentinean government has drawn up plans to peacefully reintegrate the rebelling provinces. Concessions to the rebels will have to be made but the Buenos Aires administration feels confident that their Southern counterpart is willing to put an end to the hostilities as well. Army commanders are keeping a close eye on the developments but aren't willing to intervene until absolutely necessary, still remembering their downfall during the Ramírez presidency."
argdem.8.a:0 "Make them an offer they can't refuse!"

argdem.9.t:0 "Buenos Aires Extends the Olive Branch"
argdem.9.d:0 "Unwilling to shed further blood in the conflict between our fledgling state and the nation of Argentina, the democratically elected government has proposed a peaceful reunification of the two nations. Willing to make concessions and work on fixing the social inequality in the nation, Buenos Aires has offered an immediate end to hostilities should we accept."
argdem.9.a:0 "Accept the offer."
argdem.9.b:0 "Their concessions are not enough!"

argdem.10.t:0 "The FOP Accepts Reunification!"
argdem.10.d:0 "Separated for over a decade, Argentinean citizens from both Patagonia and Buenos Aires have finally reunited again. Both flags were symbolically raised one last time in Buenos Aires after which the FOP government transferred all power back to the central government. The road ahead is not going to be easy with labour conflicts at every turn but in a world ravaged by terror and war, this is a triumph for peace and stability."
argdem.10.a:0 "Long Live Argentina!"

argdem.11.t:0 "FOP Opposes Reunification!"
argdem.11.d:0 "In a surprise move, the FOP government has denied our proposal calling it a betrayal of the revolution and a bad attempt at trying to silence the opposition. They have once more pressed us to accept the reality that Patagonia will not surrender until the last revolutionary has fallen for the Fatherland!"
argdem.11.a:0 "It seems the FOP is nothing but warmongers and traitors to the republic!"

argdem.12.t:0 "Wave of Military Propaganda Throughout the Nation"
argdem.12.d:0 "Most likely inspired by the failure of the so-called 'democratic' regime to solve the FOP debacle as they had promised, has led to an increased spread of military propaganda demanding the army to step up and put the rebels down by force. Whether or not the propaganda was distributed by Army officials is unclear as of now but General Ramírez has denied all responsibility for the situation although he did confirm that the government should act quickly on the crisis or somebody else will do it in their place."
argdem.12.a:0 "Once again the government is shaking."

argdem.13.t:0 "The Opposition Starts a Vote of No Confidence!"
argdem.13.d:0 "With public opinion towards harsh military intervention in Patagonia increasing by the day, the opposition has put forward a vote of no confidence in the current government this morning. Demanding the President to step down and new elections to be held as soon as possible, it is not looking good for the current government. Their failure to reach an agreement with the FOP and their incapacity to crack down on militarism, have plummeted their popularity and with no clear solution in sight, it may be wise to step down before the situation escalates."
argdem.13.a:0 "The government falls!"
argdem.13.b:0 "The vote fails!"

argdem.14.t:0 "Ramírez Intervenes!"
argdem.14.d:0 "Continued struggles within the cabinet, the failing negotiations to keep the coalition alive and the ever-growing threat on the Southern border have finally prompted Ramírez to shoot back into action and depose the government. Calling his decision to return power back to the people the worst in years, he has firmly reassumed control over the nation promising immediate intervention against the FOP and a crackdown on troublemakers in Argentina itself."
argdem.14.a:0 "Three hurrahs for President Ramírez!"

argdem.15.t:0 "Elections are Approaching"
argdem.15.d:0 "Since the young coalition was incapable of ruling the nation and a vote of no confidence successfully dethroned them, new elections were written out to decide on the next president. The Army, however, is not interested in another open election and would rather influence the results of the elections so they can rule the nation. Ramírez as the liberator of the people from the Carlés tyranny would lead the ballot and achieve an overwhelming victory with the support of the armed forces."
argdem.15.a:0 "The results should not be tampered with!"
argdem.15.b:0 "Our citizens are disillusioned and need a strong guardian."

argdem.16.t:0 "Ramírez Wins a Crushing Victory!"
argdem.16.d:0 "A strong campaign by the general, his overwhelming charisma and his firm gaze on the future have won him a crushing victory today, outperforming all other candidates...or so tells the state television. In reality, only a small fraction of the population supported the general and a sweeping victory was supposed to go to the Democratic coalition. Complaints from the other parties have been filed but seem to have been lost in the mail or denied by the High Court."
argdem.16.a:0 "Long live Ramírez."

argdem.17.t:0 "Election Day in Argentina"
argdem.17.d:0 "Tensions are running high in Buenos Aires with the second free elections since the military took over the nation, being held so close to the last ones. With faith in a democratic solution decreasing by the day, we will need a strong convincing president to prevent extremist elements from seizing power. All parties are polling very well but the three main competitors are found in the Uníon Cívica Radical, Uníon Cívica Radical Antipersonalista and Partido Demócrata Nacional. With the last booths closed, the results start coming in and the victory goes to ..."
argdem.17.a:0 "Marcelo T. de Alvear."
argdem.17.b:0 "José Pascual Taborini."

ARG_Agustin_P_Justo_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 26, 1876, in Concepcion del Uruguay, Entre Rios, Argentina\n§YMilitary Career:§W Justo went to a military school at the young age of eleven, where he joined the artillery corps. As a cadet, along with many other students and UCR members, he took part in the 'Revolución del Parque' which asked for greater democratic representation and the end of fraud that plagued Argentinean elections. He was arrested and then amnestied, managing to graduate in 1892 with the rank of second lieutenant and keeping many of the UCR contacts he met during the revolt. Without leaving his military career, he began studying engineering in the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires', becoming a military engineer in 1904. He was appointed as Headmaster of the 'El Palomar' military school in 1915, and minister of war in 1922 thanks to his connections within the 'UCRA'. He took part in the 1930's coup that Uriburu staged against Yrigoyen and has since then remained an influential figure within the army, with many looking up to him within the armed forces as he remains one of the few officers who wants the army to stay out of the political landscape.\n§YImportant Notes:§W His son, Liborio, ran off to the FOP when they rebelled. While it is clear that he loves his country and his son, it's not clear which one he would choose over the other.\n- Rumoured to be a member of the GOU, but no substantial evidence has been found to support this claim."

He was later assigned in 1934 as the garrison commander of the 'Campo de Mayo', the biggest military base in the country.

He was rescued by his uncle, and was sent to Argentina to be taken care of by another of his uncles.

He found a Brazilian horse in a field and managed to ride it, and the horse took him to his rider.

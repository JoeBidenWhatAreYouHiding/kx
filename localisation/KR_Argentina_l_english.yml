ARG_national_populist_party:0 "LP"
ARG_national_populist_party_long:0 "Liga Patriótica Argentina\n§LArgentine Patriotic League§!\n§gLiga Patriótica was found in 1919, when Carlés was appointed as a commander of the paramilitary volunteers that were sent in to end protests of the workers on English-owned plant. The LPA was responsible for the deaths of hundreds, continuing their bloody acts during the Patagonian revolt and a general strike in Buenos Aires. In 1930 Liga participated in Uriburu's coup, who, with the support of the army and the LPA, ousted the government and installed a corporatist, ultranationalist military dictatorship. In 1932, the military regime collapsed after Uriburu's death. After a power struggle, UCR member Julio Roca became the new head of state. Roca began to seek a peace settlement with the Patagonians. Carlés took advantage of the popular outrage and launched a coup d'état on the 24th of December 1935 with the support of navy and parts of the military. The LPA sees the salvation of Argentina as their primary goal, claiming to serve the people for a greater good.§!"
ARG_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "LdJ (GOU)"
ARG_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Libertadores de Junio (Grupo de Oficiales Unidos)\n§LJune Liberators (Group of United Officers)§!\n§gIt is a secret club that reflects and comprises 'the heart and soul of the military leadership.' It is also known as the Group of United Officers (GOU). Created during Julio Argentino Pascual Roca presidency in 1933 due to military opposition to possible peace treaty with Patagonian socialists. Although they oppose ex-President Roca's conciliatory stance with the FOP's 'godless socialists,' they are disillusioned of Carlés policies, viewing him as a 'dangerous radical,' and would prefer a firmer hand, one that has the backing of the Argentine people behind it...\nThis group has strong nationalist and Catholic ideas, as well as a strict neutrality approach to foreign policy, believing that Argentina should avoid wars with both regional powers such as Brazil and global players, be it Reichspakt, Entente, or even Internationale. Patagonia and socialist Chile are exceptions; reunification of the nation is one of their key goals, and failure to achieve it by the government might have catastrophic implications.§!"
ARG_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "PJ"
ARG_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Partido Justicialista\n§LJusticialist Party§!\n§gThe Justicialists comprise Juan Domingo Perón's political network who themselves are only a few radical Argentine officers and some trade union leaders. Perón espouses a concept of a party in service of a strong and just leader who would unify the population into bringing about social justice, these ideas however marginal, hold great appeal to a population tired of political squabbling and sterile dictatorships. It remains to be seen whenether Perón's group hold any sway in the new Argentinian political climate.§!"
ARG_social_conservative_party:0 "UCRA"
ARG_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Unión Cívica Radical Antipersonalista\n§LAnti-Personalist Radical Civic Union§!\n§gThe UCRA was part of a broad movement calling itself 'anti-personalist', which questioned the figure of Hipólito Yrigoyen (president from 1916-1922 / 1928-1930), whom they accused of being 'personalist' and undemocratic. Created in 1924 from a rupture within the UCR, In the 1928 elections, it presented the candidacy of Leopoldo Melo, who lost to Hipólito Yrigoyen, candidate of the UCR. Starting in 1932, it joined the coalition called the Concordancia that won the 1932 elections with Julio Argentino Pascual Roca becoming a president.§!"
ARG_market_liberal_party:0 "PDN"
ARG_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Partido Demócrata Nacional\n§LNational Democratic Party§!\n§gThe PDN (PNA until 1932) was one of Argentina's oldest political parties and closely connected to the Roca family, who provided two Argentinian Presidents in the last 50 years: Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz (1880-1886, 1898-1904) and Julio Argentino Pascual Roca (1932-1935). It was created on March 15th, 1874, after the union of the Autonomist Party and the National Party. It was since its inception a highly important party, and the Roca family became very influential within the party, with Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz becoming a president in 1880-1886 and 1898-1904. It later became the bedrock of la edad de oro (1880 - 1916), boasting a booming economy and a flood of immigrants from Europe which strengthened Argentina's industry, becoming one of the most prosperous contries in the world before the Weltkrieg. Meanwhile, its main rival became the Radical Civic Union (UCR). It was criticized for its use of election fraud, which lead to PNA dissolving with its members joining Conservative Party and the Democratic Progressive Party.\nFollowing Uriburu's death in early 1932, the PNA was reborn as Partido Demócrata Nacional (PDN) for the upcoming 1932 elections with Julio Argentino Pascual Roca being its leader, and PDN, thanks to electoral fraud, won by a landslide. Roca was inaugurated president, and he promised to find a compromise with their syndicalist neighbors Patagonia and Chile. Although many hoped that Roca would bring back the good old times and strengthen Argentina's position globally, this did not happen. Although he took a less radical course than Uriburu and developed plans to recapture the lost territories at Patagonia, launching small skirmishes into FOP territory and successfully retaking Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego thanks to the navy, he scrapped plans to send the army into Patagonian core territory, deciding to focus more on improving the economy. Roca's takeover disgruntled the military and the LPA, and due to his political liberalisation, rumours started to spread in 1935 that there would be an imminent peace settlement with the Patagonians, causing outrage across the nation. This was enough for Carlés and the LPA to launch a coup on Christmas day, putting Roca and his ministers under temporary house arrest as Carlés proclaimed himself President.§!"
ARG_social_liberal_party:0 "UCR"
ARG_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Unión Cívica Radical\n§LRadical Civic Union§!\n§gFounded on June 26th, 1891, the party quickly became influential over Argentine politics, causing the 1893 Radical Revolution and the 1905 Radical Revolution, which later led to reform in terms of election fraud. Two presidents of Argentina to be part of the Radical Civic Union were Hipólito Yrigoyen and Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. In 1916 the Argentine General Election took place, being the first where the Roque Sáenz Peña Law was implemented, establishing universal, secret and compulsory male suffrage. Yrigoyen, candidate of the UCR, ended up winning the elections. His tumultous presidency between 1916 - 1922, with the secession of Patagonia, had de Alvear replace him as the UCR candidate for the 1922 elections, which he won. Argentina saw slight economic improvement right until the British Revolution occurred, which led to the crash of April 1925. Despite this, de Alvear ordered the navy to capture the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. This increased morale and trust in the government, but led to the radicalisation of the military which had been previously humiliated by the Patagonian Rebellion, and now stood in the shadow of the popular navy.\nIn 1928, Yrigoyen was surprisingly appointed as the Radical Civic's Union candidate for the general elections instead of the current and relatively popular Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. Despite this, Yrigoyen won by a large margin, which led many to speculate that it was due to election fraud. Yrigoyen's most important opposition was the military, which started planning a coup against him. This eventually happened on September 6th, 1930, as Uriburu, with support from Carlés and the LPA, took over and proclaimed himself president of Argentina, banning political parties, arresting democratic politicians and suspending the 1853 Constitution. Yrigoyen's supporters, called Yrigoyenists, were tortured alongside other political opponents of his regime. Yrigoyen himself was held under arrest at the Martín García Island. Uriburu eventually died in early 1932, and Argentina went back to democracy under conservative politician Julio Argentino Pascual Roca. Yrigoyen died in 1933, and now de Alvear is leading the party.§!"

It became Argentina's third-most important party after the popular Radical Civic Union and the National Autonomist Party, battling the spot with the Socialist Party. After Uriburu's coup, the Democratic Progressive Party regained some popularity.§!"

ARG_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Partido Socialista\n§LSocialist Party§!\n§gA minuscule party compared to the ones present in Patagonia. Founded in 1896 by Nicolás Repetto, it became the first mass party in Argentina. It gained notoriety, gaining its first representative in 1903 and becoming the first socialist in America to obtain a representative charge, and then in 1904 Alfredo Palacios became the first socialist deputy in America. It gained more and more traction and then started participating in the general elections after the Roque Sáenz Peña Law was passed, being in 4th place in the 1916 and 1922 general elections and then 3rd in the 1928 general elections. But it soon found itself marginalized amid the growing Red Scare and finally banned. The PS continues to operate clandestinely.§!"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_CARLES_DESC:0 "Manuel Carlés began his political career when he joined the Union Civica Radical 1898, which had been gaining popularity as it had recently been formed, back in 1891. He then climbed through the ranks of the party until he managed to become a national deputy for the province of Santa Fe in the national congress. He was assigned in 1918 by his colleague, president Hipólito Yrigoyen, as 'Interventor' of the Salta province, starting a long record of interventions by said government. His methods granted him enough experience to be allowed to become a teacher in the 'Colegio Militar de la Nacion' and the 'Escuela Superior de Guerra'.\n\nWith the unofficial formation of the 'Liga Patriotica' during the 'Semana Tragica', Carlés began making contact with the organisation, which was officially born in 1920 with Carlés as its leader. The organisation then began promoting the persecution of jews, anarchists, socialists and foreigners that refuse to integrate to the local Argentinean culture, and with the growing unrest, he began scheming his takeover, backed by many within the navy and a few army officers. With his coup d'etat now being successful, he now sits in the 'Casa Rosada' in Buenos Aires, but his regime has not yet been recognized by the other provinces. Whether he'll be able to secure power and accomplish his promises of expansion and prosperity remains to be seen..."
POLITICS_DOMINGO_PERON_DESC:0 "Juan Domingo Perón, having grown up in the rural Patagonia, entered the 'Colegio Militar de la Nación' In 1911 thanks to a scholarship paid by Antonio M. Silva, a close friend of his grandfather. Despite becoming a national fencing champion, which turned him into a celebrity for the oligarchy, he's hardly had any relevant political position in his life, but the FOP's secession from Argentina has caused him great concern. After a short trip to Europe, he has changed his point of view regarding politics, and has returned to Argentina motivated by a will to help the working men of the country and take the nation to new heights. Now, with many in the lower classes, the trade unions and even in the Oligarchy desiring Perón's leadership, it remains to be seen if he will truly be able to achieve his promises..."
POLITICS_ALICIA_JUSTO_DESC:0 "Alicia Moreau de Justo was born in 1885 in the city of London, England. Her father, Armand Mureau, was a member of the French Paris Commune during the 1871 uprising and Her family was forced to move to Argentina in 1890. She met Hipólito Yrigoyen, who was professor of moral and civic instruction in her school, where they kept a friendly relation, with Yrigoyen beggining to inspire the young woman towards political activism. In 1906 she founded the Argentinean Feminist Movement, joining the Socialist Party and later entering the 'Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Buenos Aires' in 1907, where she graduated as a Physician a few years later.\n\nHowever, with the Great War raging on and the anarchist uprisings, her views began to conflict with the more radicalized Baldomeristas in the PS. As the Red Scare ran through the nation, she was forced to go underground until very recently. Always valuing democracy and pacifism, now Mureau has managed to become Head of State, where she is bound to try to take the country towards her vision of a new, equal and peaceful Argentina."
POLITICS_PABLO_RAMIREZ_DESC:0 "Pedro Pablo Ramirez went to military school at a young age, even managing to serve in the German Army until 1913. He was one of the most active members of the 1930 Uriburu's coup d’état, and was his head of the information service of the general staff until Uriburu's death in 1932. While not a direct member of the GOU, his son is one of the founders, granting him a wide array of military and political contacts that he can use if the situation requires it.\n\nNow that Ramirez has managed to become Head of State, he shall rule Argentina with an iron-fist, trying to enforce the discipline, nationalism and faith in Catholicism he was taught to the Argentinean society at large. However, it remains to be seen if his connections within the GOU are enough to stay in power if he ever manages to deviate from their vision for Argentina..."
POLITICS_JOSE_TAMBORINI_DESC:0 "Jose Pascual Tamborini joined the 'Union Civica Radical' when he was still in highschool. He was one of the mediators between the workers at the 'Taller Vassena' and the national authorities, where he failed to successfully reach a compromise, which lead to a major crackdown in the events leading up to the dreaded 'Semana Tragica'. His party didn't fare much better, as the increasing authoritarianism of Yrigoyen began splitting the party into the old 'UCR' and the new 'Union Civica Radical Antipersonalista'.\n\nTamborini joined the latter while he was minister of the interior during Marcelo T. de Alvear's presidency. In 1935 he was chosen as national deputy, and his political experience has managed to allow him to get enough support to run for presidency. Now that he's head of state, it falls to him to bring about the reforms that Leandro N. Alem, founder of the 'UCR' back in 1891, had envisioned for Argentina, and end once and for all the corrupt practices that have plagued Argentinean democracy!"
POLITICS_ROBUSTIANO_COSTAS_DESC:0 "Robustiano Patrón Costas graduated from highschool in 1895 and by 1900, he had graduated the 'Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Sociales de Buenos Aires' as a Lawyer with a PhD in jurisprudence, accomplishing one of his father's last wishes before he died. Robustiano took over his father's company, 'Patrón Hermanos' and then went on to become involved in Salta's Politics until he was elected governor of the same province between 1913 and 1916 with an independent party. His government in that province was characterized by great political stability and financial balance, and became one of the first provinces to fully embrace the Saenz Peña law.\n\nIn 1932, with the death of Uriburu and the upcoming elections, he formed among other independent leaders the 'Partido Democratico Nacional', where he was chosen as head of the party. Now that Robustiano has managed to achieve presidency, his entrepreneurial spirit, fiscal responsibility and compromise skills will surely usher in a new age of economic prosperity for Argentina."
POLITICS_NICOLAS_REPETTO_DESC:0 "Nicolas Repetto graduated as physician from the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' with plenty of experience in surgery thanks to an European internship which lasted until 1897. He was very active in politics from a young age, participating in the 'Revolucion del Parque' in 1890. Afterwards, he founded with his friend, Juan B. Justo, the 'Diario del Pueblo', one of the first socialist newspapers in Argentina. In 1900 he finally decided to affiliate to the 'Partido Socialista' which Justo had helped found, and then both founded the cooperative 'El Hogar Obrero' in 1905.\n\nAfter the death of Juan B. Justo, he became the obvious candidate of the now more moderate Partido Socialista, but didn't manage to win the 1932 national elections. Now that he has managed to become president, he'll strive to turn Argentina away from the exploitative practices of the past and into a better, more egalitarian tomorrow."
POLITICS_HIPOLITO_YRIGOYEN_DESC:0 "When Juan Hipólito del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Yrigoyen finished high school, he began his political career when he assisted Alem in the creation of the Union Civica, and when it subsequently split during the Roca regime, he continued assisting his uncle with the Union Civica Radical. He kept climbing through the ranks of the party until becoming his uncle right-hand man and participating in the 'Revolución del Parque' as one of the main instigators. However, Alem's suicide became a hard hit for the UCR, and an even harder hit for Yrigoyen, who temporarily retired from politics until 1904, working as a teacher in the meantime.\n\nHe then reorganized the UCR in 1904 and managed to get one of his friends, Roque Sáenz Peña, elected as President in 1910, and even becoming President himself from 1916 to 1922. He pushed for progressive reforms and tried to normalize the Argentinean electoral system, even intervening in provinces that were under the control of wealthy elites. He even began granting workers better work laws and began negotiating with many strikers. However, British pressure forced him to begin the crackdowns that lead to the 'Semana Tragica', and the events that subsequently created the FOP.\n\nHis increasing authoritarianism lead to factionalism in the UCR and the subsequent split of the UCRA, and when he was re-elected in 1938, where his antagonizing position against the army and the local elites caused the Uriburu's 1930 coup, where he was banned from politics. Now that he's president again, he'll finish the reforms that he started in 1928 and will try to bring about his uncle's vision of a strong and democratic Argentina."
POLITICS_JOSE_PETER_DESC:0 "Jose Peter, like many other 'Gauchos' from rural areas, was forced to move to the big cities in search of work, more specifically to the city of Zarate in 1923. His first political experience was in 1927, when he signed up with the 'Sindicato de Frigorificos de Zarate', where he helped create the 'Federación Obreros de la Industria de la Carne' with other trade unions of Zarate and Berisso.\n\nWhen Uriburu came to power, he was sent to the Ushuaia penitentiary after organizing a successful strike where he demanded the company 'River Plate de Zarate' to pay their worker's wages which had been delayed for two months. Now that he's free and in control of Argentina, he'll make sure to provide justice for the workers from the exploitation of the bourgeoisie."
POLITICS_ANGEL_BORLENGHI_DESC:0 "Angel Borlenghi became involved in politics with the local socialists of Pompeya's neighbourhood at a very young age, joining the 'Gremio de Empleados de Comercio'('Trade Employees Syndicate') and the Socialist Party as soon as he came of age. Unlike the leadership within the Socialist Party, he liked to keep direct contact with the workers, which gained him a lot of support among the trade unions. Despite having an illustrious performance within the 'CGT' ('Central General del Trabajo'), he never managed to climb up the ranks within the Socialist Party.\n\nAfter Uriburu's coup and the subsequent crackdowns on anarchist, syndicalists and socialists, he was arrested and taken to the Ushuaia penitentiary. Now that he's free and sits within the 'Casa Rosada', He'll use his connections within the Trade Unions to lead Argentina to a better tomorrow with the worker's consent."
POLITICS_ARTURO_FRONDIZI_DESC:0 "Arturo Frondizi was a strong supporter of the UCR and a defender of democracy when Yrigoyen managed to win the presidency, but refused to participate in any sort of political activity. However, Uriburu's coup forced him to change his point of view regarding democracy, where he even refused attending his own graduation ceremony which Uriburu would attend to give him an Honor Diploma in Law.\n\nHe was arrested in a democratic demonstration in 1931. This very detention has made Frondizi decide to leave his work as a law professor and begin a career as a politician. At the end of 1932, he was arrested at another rally, and when he was released he joined the UCR.\n\nHe has since then joined a faction within the UCR that considers the approach of Marcelo T. de Alvear to be too conservative, and he has made promises to bring more progressive reforms to Argentina and return to the economic policies Yrigoyen enacted. Now that he sits in the 'Casa Rosada', it remains to be seen if he'll be true to his word."
POLITICS_RICARDO_BALBIN_DESC:0 "In 1922, when he became 18, Ricardo Balbín joined the UCR and moves to La Plata, where local political activism drove him to sign up in the 'Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata', where he graduated as a lawyer in 1927, but hardly ever using his title as he has since then fully committed to his political career.\n\nHe was chosen as provincial deputy in 1932 and 1940, however, he resigned his last post in condemnation to the fraud that plagued local elections. He has since then left the UCR and joined the more moderate 'Partido Democrata Nacional', where he has promised to bring an end to the corruption that plagues Argentinean society and finally usher in a new era of prosperity."
POLITICS_ROBERTO_ORTIZ_DESC:0 "Roberto Marcelino Ortiz signed up into the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' to study medicine, but he was forced to change his career to Law due to a strike from the student's centre which caused the medicine section to be closed down temporarily. He affiliated the UCR and participated in the failed 1905 revolution. When the UCR split, he joined the UCRA and became public works minister for Marcelo T. de Alvear.\n\nDespite his support for the democratic process, he supported Uriburu's coup, although he despised Uriburu's economic policies. After the Carlés coup, Ortiz has become convinced that the political corruption in Argentina has to end once and for all if democracy is ever to survive in Argentina, and will endeavour all of his efforts from the 'Casa Rosada' to strengthen the democratic process and end local corruption, with intervention if needed."
POLITICS_EDELMIRO_FARRELL_DESC:0 "Born to an Irish migrant family, Edelmiro Julian Farrel enrolled in a military school and graduated in 1907. While no one doubts of his military ability and personal charisma, he was never prepared to be a politician. Now that the role of presidency has been thrusted upon him after overthrowing Ramirez, he has become a mere puppet of the GOU's control over the country. He relies mostly on his vice-president, Juan Domingo Perón, to do most of the political work, where Farrel only ever appears in public ceremonies and signs public documents in the name of the GOU."
POLITICS_MARCELO_ALVEAR_DESC:0 "Alvear became involved in politics at a young age, helping organize a meeting in Jardin Florida which would lead to the 'Revolución del Parque', after which he became secretary for Leandro N. Alem. He continued serving Alem until his suicide, after which he left to France for a time and got married. He was elected deputy between 1912 and 1916 without even residing in the country, forcing him to return to Argentina during the Sáenz Peña regime, after which he became Argentinean ambassador to France, even donating a large amount of wealth for the construction of front line hospitals.\n\nHe was elected as president from 1922 to 1928, where he tried to reduce the FOP's influence in Argentina at large by granting better rights for workers in the country, although he had kept a hardline stance towards the FOP, mostly due to militaristic influences in his staff. Like his predecessor, Yrigoyen, he tried to intervene provinces that had their elections rigged by wealthy local elites, but his methods polarized the UCR and the UCRA even more. Nevertheless, his progressive social, educational and economic reforms have left a positive impression in the Argentinean people, and now that he's been re-elected as president, he'll try to re-enact and continue the reforms for which he stood for in his first presidency."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_DE_ANDREA_DESC:0 "Miguel de Andrea began his career after being ordained in 1899 by the Bishop of La Plata, Juan Terrero. He climbed steadily the ranks of the church until becoming the Head Priest of the San Miguel de Arcangel Church, and being named director of a Social-Christian Trade Union, the Circulos Obreros Catolicos, after the death of its founder, Federico Grote. However, unlike his founder, Miguel de Andrea took a hardline stance against the rising anarchist movements growing in the city of Buenos Aires, and as such quickly found himself aligning with the Liga Patriotica, taking part in their rallies and putting them into contact with the most reactionary sectors of the Argentinean branch of the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, his views never aligned with the league, and he found himself coinciding more with the Portuguese Integralists who catered to his anti-liberal, ultra-catholic and Corporatist mindset. While originally skeptic of a Brazilian victory, he quickly abandoned the Liga Patriotica as the defeat seemed imminent, and began pushing his contacts in the Brazilian church in order to proclaim his loyalty to the Integralists. Without any solid military or civilian leaders willing to obey Brazilian commands, Miguel was chosen as the provisional President of Argentina until a more stable government can be settled in favour of the Integralist doctrine, which Miguel believes will finally bring faith in God, the Church and the government back to the workers."

ARG_Woes_of_the_Christmas_Coup_desc:0 "Thrown into chaos by Manuel Carlés and the LP just after the Christmas celebrations last year, the nation of Argentina is in a state of total anarchy with various military elements vying for control over the presidency."
ARG_Consolidate_Buenos_Aires_Capital_Region:0 "Consolidate the GBA Capital Region"
ARG_Consolidate_Buenos_Aires_Capital_Region_desc:0 "Even though the capital was the first city to fall to the boots of the LP and the ARA, Buenos Aires is a megalopolis, spanning from the Tigre river to the old city of Berazategui, creating a huge problem for us, since various cells of loyalists to the old government still remain scattered throughout the region, thwarting thus far, all attempts by our forces to eradicate them."
ARG_Expand_the_Gendarmeria:0 "Found the Gendarmería"
ARG_Expand_the_Gendarmeria_desc:0 "To better control the discontent provinces and to secure a rapid response force, should the situation escalate, we should consider the creation of an 'Argentinean National Gendarmerie', placed directly under the defence minister's commands, to crack down on rebelling provinces."
ARG_Control_the_Judiciaries:0 "Control the Judiciaries"
ARG_Control_the_Judiciaries_desc:0 "Due to the high number of 'rebels' and 'syndicalist sympathisers' in our nation, full control over the judicial system could persuade the judges to crack down quicker on these criminals."
ARG_Secure_the_Military_Apparatus:0 "Secure the Military Apparatus"
ARG_Secure_the_Military_Apparatus_desc:0 "Since we only have the loyalty of the ARA and LP militias, for now, we should convince the garrisons and militia outposts to join our side and cast aside the 'democratic' forces until we can get enough influence to sway the Argentinean Army in our favour."
ARG_Control_the_Railroads:0 "Control the Railroads"
ARG_Control_the_Railroads_desc:0 "All railways in Argentina lead to Buenos Aires which places us in the unique position to quickly lash out and quell forces rallying across the country. Sabotage and rebel forces, however, have greatly damaged these tracks and will need to be crushed, and the main railway hubs of Pergamino, Bahia Blanca and Rosario have to be secured before we can move on."
ARG_Temporarily_Restrict_Civil_Rights:0 "Temporarily Restrict Civil Rights"
ARG_Temporarily_Restrict_Civil_Rights_desc:0 "The Constitution conflicts with various points of our policies and should temporarily be suspended until this crisis is over. While we are expecting heavy resistance to the decision, it will be in favour of our great nation!"

ARG_Formation_of_the_Carles_Cabinet_desc:0 "As our hold on Argentina is all but secure, we can finally dedicate ourselves to establishing a loyal and efficient cabinet to assist Carlés in his reforms."
ARG_Secure_Pampeana:0 "Secure 'La Pampa'"
ARG_Secure_Pampeana_desc:0 "Following the defeat at Rosario, we should send the army to secure the Pampas plains and root out all remaining opposition. However, the Pampas plains are one of the biggest swaths of arable land in the world, so it won't be an easy fight."
ARG_March_on_Cordoba:0 "March on Cordoba"
ARG_March_on_Cordoba_desc:0 "The province of Cordoba has always had trouble aligning with the views of the capital, Buenos Aires. As the leaders of the coalition against Carlés, and due to its distance from the capital, the people of Cordoba have proven to be tough to deal with and will require specialised forces to keep them in check."
ARG_Consolidate_Mendoza:0 "Consolidate Mendoza"
ARG_Consolidate_Mendoza_desc:0 "Famous for its wine production, the region of Mendoza is a key economic and strategic area for our nation, considering the largest and safest mountainous passage towards Chile lies there, and thus has to be brought back under our control at all costs."
ARG_Purge_Socialist_Remnants:0 "Temor Rojo"
ARG_Purge_Socialist_Remnants_desc:0 "Even though almost all socialist sympathisers fled south after the FOP proclaimed its independence, some have remained amongst us,  waiting for the time to backstab us and finish what the FOP started, giving us the perfect excuse to eradicate dissidents amongst the opposition with national security in mind."
ARG_Eradicate_Loyalist_Resistance:0 "Eradicate Conservative Resistance"
ARG_Eradicate_Loyalist_Resistance_desc:0 "As our grasp on the nation becomes stronger by the day, there are still those who see our regime as an offence to Argentinean democracy and Argentinean values, and who plot in the shadows to overthrow us. Punitive actions and propaganda against these traitors should bring the population back in line and quell any possible resistance."
ARG_Fall_of_Tucuman:0 "Fall of Tucuman"
ARG_Fall_of_Tucuman_desc:0 "Tucuman is not a key industrial centre in our nation by any stretch, but it's a city held dear by Argentinean patriots. It's the city where our declaration of independence from Spain was finally signed, and where our country was born. Now, the very same city shall bear witness of a national rebirth when we finally take control over it."
ARG_Corrientes_Campaign:0 "Start the Corrientes Campaign"
ARG_Corrientes_Campaign_desc:0 "Tensions with the Paraguayans have forced us to be extra careful in handling this province and failing to do so may provoke Paraguayan aggression, especially in our time of weakness. However, Corrientes is our gateway to Misiones, and we refuse to surrender these provinces to any foreign foe!"
ARG_Retake_Santiago_and_Salta:0 "Retake Santiago and Salta"
ARG_Retake_Santiago_and_Salta_desc:0 "An important mining district and our main production centre for the precious sugar cane, these provinces are an important vessel for our economy and it is our duty to retake them from rebel hands. While they are fairly underdeveloped for now, we have plans for these provinces. Time will tell if they will come to fruition."
ARG_Political_Dominance:0 "Complete Political Dominance"
ARG_Political_Dominance_desc:0 "Opposition is treason to the Republic and only slows us down in these trying times. Was it not their pathetic attempt at ruling the nation that led to the survival of the FOP rebellion? We shall not repeat their past mistakes, as we shall be, as Carlés says, 'Patriotic knights capable of presenting our lives as a sacrifice against barbarism to save civilisation'."

ARG_Countercoup:0 "Successful Countercoup"

We shall install legal safeguards so that never again can our rights be vulnerated by extremists. The Constitutional Supremacy Principle shall not be questioned anymore!"
ARG_Stability_on_the_streets:0 "Stability on the Streets"
ARG_Stability_on_the_streets_desc:0 "Even though the main force of the LP has been defeated, supporters of the movement are not willing to give in so easily and have openly challenged their rivals on the streets of Buenos Aires. Riots, brawls, shootouts and assassinations have become commonplace and it's now our duty to restore law and order to our country!"
ARG_Crack_down_on_Liga_Patriotica:0 "Crack Down on the Liga Patriotica"

ARG_Social_Reforms:0 "Start Social Reforms"
ARG_Social_Reforms_desc:0 "Labour disputes between the government and the working class have been a red line throughout our predecessors’ rule. Based on the example of progressive European nations whilst combining it with a distinct Argentinean nature, we hope to provide a strong social solution to the issues that have plagued the nation and hopefully learn from the mistakes of the past."
ARG_Social_Reforms2:0 "Continue Social Reforms"
ARG_Social_Reforms2_desc:0 "Labour disputes between the government and the working class have been a red line throughout our predecessors’ rule.

ARG_Power_of_Capital:0 "Power of Capital"
ARG_Power_of_Capital_desc:0 "Since our nation was born, Argentina has had a meteoric rise to the top amongst some of the wealthiest nations in the world. The unpaid debts the British left after their collapse and the subsequent rebellion by the FOP may have delayed us, but nothing shall not stop us in our way towards prosperity! After all, money makes the world go round and Argentina is part of this world."
ARG_Attract_Foreign_Investement:0 "Attract Foreign Investment"
ARG_Attract_Foreign_Investement_desc:0 "We lack the capital and technical know-how to fully develop our industrial prowess and we should thus search for foreign assistance and attract ventures by relaxing some of the industrial laws."
ARG_Uphold_Civil_Liberties:0 "Uphold Civil Liberties"
ARG_Uphold_Civil_Liberties_desc:0 "Individual Freedom is guaranteed by our constitution and should always be our number one priority. Never again shall a movement like the LP be allowed to infringe upon these rights!"

ARG_Uphold_the_Status_Quo:0 "Uphold the Status Quo"
ARG_Uphold_the_Status_Quo_desc:0 "The recent developments in our country have left our populace really distrustful of radical politicians. Our people need solid ground to stand on and the radical ideas other parties encourage might be the chance we need to secure our popularity. As a bonus, plenty of officers in the army support us, which allows us to move a bit more freely without the fear of a treacherous coup."
ARG_Church_Ties:0 "Church Ties"
ARG_Church_Ties_desc:0 "Faith is a key pillar of Argentinean society and our ties with the church are vital to staying in power. Encouraging their development projects and allowing them near unlimited freedom will surely prove to be a wise decision."
ARG_Long_Live_the_Republic:0 "Long Live the Republic!"
ARG_Long_Live_the_Republic_desc:0 "We've had a few tough years behind us but the spirit of the republic has survived and we stand stronger than ever before! We shall uphold the system for which our forefathers fought! ¡Viva Argentina!"
ARG_Rigged_Elections:0 "Rigged Elections"
ARG_Rigged_Elections_desc:0 "Our people don't know what good is for them, they might even throw themselves at the hands of the FOP or LP radicals if allowed! They need a strong guardian to protect them in their time of need...like General Ramírez!"
ARG_Restrict_the_press:0 "Restrict the Press"
ARG_Restrict_the_press_desc:0 "Fake news has engulfed the press, with smearing campaigns towards our government running wild, and should be put to a stop...for the greater good of the country of course! We only seek to protect the truth from those who seek to twist it in their favour."
ARG_Military_Supremacy:0 "Military Supremacy"
ARG_Military_Supremacy_desc:0 "We should show the world that Argentina will not be toyed with and that our army stands amongst the strongest in the world. We have looked up to Europe in the past, and we shall do so again until our military is on par with their standards."

ARG_Ties_with_Germany:0 "Ties with Germany"
ARG_Ties_with_Germany_desc:0 "As our primary trade partner, it only makes sense that Germany is our first pick for an alliance. While Ramírez is a fan of seeking closer ties to the Germans, especially considering the huge amount of German migrants Argentina has received over the years, others have voiced their concerns and could act if we would risk Argentinean neutrality by joining a faction that might draw our peaceful country into war."

ARG_Five_Year_Plan:0 "First Five-Year Plan"
ARG_Five_Year_Plan_desc:0 "Even though we pursued rapid industrialisation in the last decade to cope with the loss of British imports, our economy is not on par with our European examples. The Black Monday Crisis has shown this vulnerability to parliament which is likely to approve a so-called 5-year plan to propel Argentina into the 20th century."
ARG_Reduce_Textile_Reliance:0 "Reduce Reliance on Textile"
ARG_Reduce_Textile_Reliance_desc:0 "We have routinely relied on our agricultural and textile products for decades but competition with the other nations has become tough, forcing us to adapt the industry to a more modern equivalent and diversify the economy."

ARG_TAMET_Steel:0 "TAMET Steel"
ARG_TAMET_Steel_desc:0 "The lack of European steel is severely hurting our economy and will need intervention quickly if we are to keep our war machine going. With that in mind, we have decided to invest in 'Talleres Metalurgicos', who shall provide us with better ways of using steel and a few local steel mills."
ARG_Budget_Cuts:0 "Budget Cuts"
ARG_Budget_Cuts_desc:0 "Black monday severely cripples our economy, and unfortunately, without budget cuts we can't overcome it. Social payments and army funding have to be reduced until the economy is stable enough to support them."
ARG_Parana_Infrastructure_Plan:0 "Railway Expansion Plan"

ARG_Strive_for_Autarky_desc:0 "To power our factories we need iron ore, coal and steel which we sorely lack. Rumours of reserves, however, have surfaced and we could try to investigate the value behind these and thus work towards creating a more self-sufficient system."

ARG_Grants_for_the_Universidad_de_Buenos_Aires_desc:0 "With the recent events regarding the LP takeover, old rivalries between the Capital and the interior cities have been revived, and now the people of the provinces of Mendoza, San Juan and San Luis are unhappy that they're forced to move to Buenos Aires in order to get a higher education. We consider their demands as fair, and as such, we have decided to found the 'Cuyo National University'."
ARG_YPF_Expansion:0 "YPF Expansion"
ARG_YPF_Expansion_desc:0 "Now that we control Patagonia, we shall let the state-owned 'Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales' expand their operations there. General Enrique Mosconi has shown plenty of interest in the project and has asked us to put him charge of YPF. Considering his experience in engineering, we believe that he can lead YPF to new heights, so we shall name him 'Director General' of YPF."
ARG_Economic_Control_over_Argentina:0 "Economic Control over Argentina"
ARG_Economic_Control_over_Argentina_desc:0 "With riots crushed and all provinces secured by the ruling government, we can start fixing the economy that has been struggling to function since the end of the Weltkrieg."
ARG_Spread_out_Military_Production:0 "Dispersed Military Production"
ARG_Spread_out_Military_Production_desc:0 "Centralising our military production could prove to be detrimental to our nation in times of war since the loss of our industrial centres would mean the end of Argentina.

ARG_Reduce_Reliance_on_Foreign_Equipement:0 "Reduce Reliance on Foreign Equipment"
ARG_Reduce_Reliance_on_Foreign_Equipement_desc:0 "Tanks, Planes, Guns and so much more are being imported from abroad with limited domestic manufacturing. If we are to stand up to the other powers of the world, we need to start bringing this production home."
ARG_Domestic_Aircraft_Manufactories:0 "Domestic Aircraft Manufactories"

ARG_Attract_Foreign_Manufacturers:0 "Attract Foreign Manufacturers"
ARG_Attract_Foreign_Manufacturers_desc:0 "Our nation has a massive untapped potential which could be exploited by foreign investors. Reducing the requirements for these companies to settle here and offering them extensive subsidies will surely bring these to our nation and boost our industry."

ARG_Mitteleuropan_Tank_Deal_desc:0 "Close partnership with our allies abroad has given us access to their technological know-how in the form of Panzers. Purchasing some of these and investigating them on Argentinean soil could boost our own research."
ARG_Increase_European_Export:0 "Increase European Export"
ARG_Increase_European_Export_desc:0 "South America is an unstable mess and does not provide a large enough market for our products. Our partners in Europe, however, are desperate for our resources and will surely buy more if we up our production."
ARG_War_Profiteering:0 "War Profiteering"
ARG_War_Profiteering_desc:0 "With war waging on the European Continent, neutral powers like us look on and smell an opportunity to sell our products to the struggling nations... for a certain price of course."

ARG_Modernise_Forestry:0 "Modernise Forestry"
ARG_Modernise_Forestry_desc:0 "Argentina has a lot of potential in the forestry industry because of its variety of climates, land quality, and consistent precipitation, which allows for the cultivation of various tree species at high growth rates. Creating a cycle of planting forests, harvesting wood, and exporting cellulose, paper, and furniture made from our wood can significantly benefit our economy."
ARG_Modernise_Fishing:0 "Expand Fishing Industry"
ARG_Modernise_Fishing_desc:0 "Expansion of our fishing industry may provide a large number of jobs for our people as well as a reliable source of food for both domestic and export needs. With wars looming in Northern America and Eastern Europe, the world needs our food exports more than ever."

ARG_Mobilise_the_Reserves_desc:0 "The time for war has come and nations all around the Southern Cone are mobilising for what is deemed to be unpreventable now.

ARG_Look_for_Allies:0 "Look for Allies"

ARG_Precision_Strikes_desc:0 "The regular infantry lacks the heavy equipment to strike the enemy precise and hard, however, our new armoured cars, tanks and mobile artillery can.

ARG_Battlecruisers:0 "Battlecruisers"
ARG_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Our ten-year long investment in our navy is paying off with the presence of several battleships in our docks. However, we realized we lack a middle ground between our heavily armed but slow battleships and our lightly armed but fast cruisers. To fill this gap, we've decided it'll be best to invest in modern Battlecruisers."
ARG_Coastal_Protection:0 "Coastal Protection"
ARG_Coastal_Protection_desc:0 "Our people's prosperity depends on keeping an open route to the sea. With that in mind, we can't allow the enemy to mine our shores and ports, so we need to invest in minesweepers and better spotting mechanisms for our navy."

ARG_Light_Cruisers_desc:0 "The 'Trento' class cruisers we bought a few years ago from the Sicilian Dockyards have become great additions to our fleet. Unfortunately, they are way too heavily armed for our current needs.

ARG_Carriers:0 "Naval Aviation"
ARG_Carriers_desc:0 "Aeroplanes have risen to prominence in the last decades and that is something we cannot deny.

#ARG_Merchant_Marine:0 "Merchant Marine" already defined above as an idea
ARG_Merchant_Marine_desc:0 "While Argentineans love to take pride in their military navy, the most important branch is not the military naval marine, but the merchant one.

ARG_Land_Fortifications:0 "Protecting the Coast"
ARG_Land_Fortifications_desc:0 "Our three main port cities, Buenos Aires, Mar del Plata and Bahia Blanca are currently unprotected from a naval invasion if our foes managed to tie down or destroy our fleet.

ARG_Comando_de_Infanteria_de_Marina:0 "Comando de Infanteria de Marina"
ARG_Comando_de_Infanteria_de_Marina_desc:0 "While the Argentinean Marines haven't had many chances to prove their worth, the exploits of Captain Hipólito Bouchard back in the day have proven the value of a landing force.

ARG_Oficina_Central_de_Hidrografia:0 "Oficina Central de Hidrografía"
ARG_Oficina_Central_de_Hidrografia_desc:0 "In naval warfare, it's not just about having better ships and officers.

Our enemies will find we're at home wherever we may encounter them."

#Events
## Military ##
argmil.10.t:0 "Lack of Funding in the Navy"
argmil.10.d:0 "Recent government adjustments to the military budget have brought our naval spending down to dangerous levels. While this has greatly empowered the military and the development of new land-based weaponry, officers from the ARA have warned us that further pulling down the budget could have dangerous consequences on the prowess of our fleet."
argmil.10.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.11.t:0 "Trouble in the Dockyards"
argmil.11.d:0 "Originating from the lack of new government contracts, some of our dockyards have been forced to close down, firing hundreds of naval workers. Social tensions between the government and the Naval Unions were already high and the recent crisis may have only worsened the relations."
argmil.11.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.12.t:0 "Explosion in Puerto Belgrano"
argmil.12.d:0 "During a routine inspection of one of our destroyers in the port, an explosion rocked the ship killing dozens of sailors and severely damaging the vessel. While official state propaganda reported the incident as a syndicalist terrorist attack, the real perpetrator is a lack of maintenance of our ever growing fleet and the incapacity of our engineering staff."
argmil.12.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.13.t:0 "Fighting in Buenos Aires"
argmil.13.d:0 "Increasing aversion between the military branches of our army came to blows last night in Buenos Aires when a group of drunk ARA sailors encountered a military patrol. Arguments surrounding the recent budget cuts for the navy led to a fistfight between the two parties and was quickly followed up by further soldiers joining in. Gendarmería eventually broke up the fights and placed the perpetrators in custody but all help came too late for one of the sailors who died of his injuries 3 hours later in the hospital."
argmil.13.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.20.t:0 "Lack of Funding in the Army"
argmil.20.d:0 "Recent government adjustments to the military budget have brought our Army spending down to dangerous levels. While this has greatly empowered the ARA and the development of new warships, officers from the Army have warned us that further pulling down the budget could have dangerous consequences on the prowess of our land forces and could open us up to foreign invasions."
argmil.20.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.21.t:0 "Rampant Desertion in the Army"
argmil.21.d:0 "Worsening living standards in the Barracks and lowered wages of our soldiers have caused many to abandon the armed forces and return to their families to support them in the wake of the economic crisis. Military Police and Gendarmería are tasked with tracking down the offenders but have as of now not been able to make a noticeable difference."
argmil.21.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.22.t:0 "Lack of Military Steel"
argmil.22.d:0 "New orders by the ARA have swallowed up all of our steel reserves and are putting orders for the land forces on the backburner. Tanks, planes and even machine guns have all been forced to lower their production to accommodate the lowered reserves and are making it hard for our army to stay up to date and fully equipped."
argmil.22.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.23.t:0 "Lack of Skilled Officers"
argmil.23.d:0 "Lowered wages and better prospects in the ARA have made many of our young potential officers turn away from the land forces and instead follow a career in the Navy. This brain-drain of new talent is weighing hard on the ageing corps and could potentially impact our capacity to lead our troops against the enemies."
argmil.23.a:0 "Troubling."

argmil.24.t:0 "Perón Introduces Alberte to the GOU"
argmil.24.d:0 "In a general staff meeting at El Palomar military base, General Juan Domingo Perón has presented a new member of the GOU for the staff. His name is Bernardino Alberte, a junior officer that graduated recently from the Military Academy with outstanding grades. However, his lack of experience has not given the best impression to the older members of the staff, as well as the fact that Perón is seemingly trying to put people he trusts in positions of power. Despite this, Perón has reassured the Old Guard about his protege's skills, and being one of the most influential and experienced officers of the GOU and the General Staff, there's no real reason to reject Perón's request. After all, the army could always use more talented officers."
argmil.24.a:0 "Let's hope this doesn't become a common occurrence."

## War in the Southern Cone ##
southern.4.t:0 "Intervention in the Argentinean-Chilean War?"
southern.4.d:0 "Argentina has kicked off the Argentinean-Chilean war by invading the FOP rebels in Patagonia. Being occupied in the South with the insurgents, this has presented us with the perfect opportunity to retake the Chaco Austral!"
southern.4.a:0 "Attack!"
southern.4.b:0 "We would rather not anger Argentina."

southern.5.t:0 "Paraguay Invades!"
southern.5.d:0 "The filthy Paraguayan dogs have smelled their chance and decided to invade us in the back to retake the Chaco Austral!"
southern.5.a:0 "Jackals!"

southern.6.t:0 "Intervention in the Argentinean-Paraguayan War?"
southern.6.d:0 "Argentina has kicked off the Argentinean-Chilean war by invading the FOP rebels in Patagonia which was promptly followed by a declaration of war by the Paraguayans. Since they are aware that we hold claims on various territories of Paraguay and Chile, they have requested us to support them in the fight and be rewarded with our claims should our alliance win."
southern.6.a:0 "Attack Paraguay!"
southern.6.b:0 "We shall attack Paraguay AND Chile!"
southern.6.c:0 "We seek no conflict."

southern.7.t:0 "Bolivia Joins on Our Side!"
southern.7.d:0 "To support us in the fight against the despicable syndicalists and their red cronies in Chile, Bolivia has also declared war on [BOL.BOL_enemies_text], pledging their full support for our cause."
southern.7.a:0 "Hurray!"

southern.8.t:0 "Bolivia Remains Neutral"
southern.8.d:0 "Wary of losing yet another war to the tiny nation of Paraguay after their humiliating defeat, Bolivia has proclaimed its neutrality in the conflict and has pledged to support neither side."
southern.8.a:0 "Most unfortunate!"

southern.9.t:0 "Fall of Chile"
southern.9.d:0 "As the last cells crumble under our might, the Chilean war machine has finally been forced to give up and the government surrendered at 4 PM, transferring all power over to us."
southern.9.a:0 "Establish a puppet regime!"
southern.9.b:0 "Annex all of Chile!"

southern.91.t:0 "Fall of Chile"
southern.91.d:0 "As Argentinean boots march through Santiago while last pockets of resistance throughout the nation are being cleaned up, our nation is forced to give up the fight as well. While some claim that we should continue to the bitter end, the population has grown weary of war and public opinion is in favour of a quick end to the conflict."
southern.91.a:0 "Surrender to Argentina."
southern.91.b:0 "We'll show those bastards what a real syndie can do!"

southern.10.t:0 "Fall of Paraguay"
southern.10.d:0 "As the last defenders are driven out of Asunción, the Paraguayan government has conceded defeat and accepted our harsh demands. All of Paraguay will be annexed into Argentina and a military government will be placed in charge of the region until further notice."
southern.10.a:0 "Cede the Chaco Boreal to Bolivia."
southern.10.b:0 "All of Paraguay belongs to us!"

southern.11.t:0 "Argentina Refuses to Cede Chaco Boreal"
southern.11.d:0 "Even though we carried their pathetic force through the bloody war, the Argentinians have the guts to refuse to return the Chaco Boreal to its rightful owner. Our populace is rightfully furious and is clamouring the government to press our claims, by war if necessary."
southern.11.a:0 "Death to Argentina!"
southern.11.b:0 "They do have a bigger army..."

## Foreign ##
argfor.100.t:0 "Argentina Offers a Pact"
argfor.100.d:0 "Increasing power of the socialists on our continent has left Argentina vulnerable. To combat this threat, they have proposed a defensive alliance between our two nations to steer off possible incursions by our mutual enemies."
argfor.100.a:0 "Sign the Pact."
argfor.100.b:0 "Refuse the offer."

argfor.200.t:0 "Treaty of Lima"

argfor.200.a:0 "Very well."

argfor.300.t:0 "Peru Refuses to Help"
argfor.300.d:0 "The Peruvian government has announced that they will not protect us against the Chilean threat and has refused to further discuss the matter."
argfor.300.a:0 "We'll do it without them then!"

argfor.1.t:0 "Buenos Aires-Lima Pact"
argfor.1.d:0 "As the Brazilian behemoth keeps building up and gearing itself for war, the small nations of South America should bond together and prevent being picked off one by one. Therefore Argentina has proposed an alliance between our two nations to stand together should war arrive."
argfor.1.a:0 "Sign the Pact."
argfor.1.b:0 "Refuse the offer."

argfor.2.t:0 "Offer Accepted"
argfor.2.d:0 "The Peruvian government has announced their support for our proposal and has ratified the accords. We hope our alliance may prosper on the continent."

argfor.3.a:0 "We'll do it without them then!"

argfor.4.t:0 "Argentina Requests Assistance"
argfor.4.d:0 "Locked in an inevitable confrontation with the FOP in Patagonia, Argentina is dedicated to purging the red threat from the continent as quickly as possible. To achieve this, they have come knocking on our door to ask for assistance in the fight as Chile is set to intervene on the behalf of the FOP. This gives us the opportunity to take back the coastline we so desire and put the Chilean people in their place. Frictions with Argentina, however, aren't fully resolved yet and the Yacuiba region could be used an argument should we no longer be an asset to Argentinean Expansion."
argfor.4.a:0 "Agree to assist."
argfor.4.b:0 "Refuse the offer."

argfor.5.t:0 "Bolivia Intervenes!"
argfor.5.d:0 "The Bolivian government has announced their support for our offensive against the Chilean people and has promised to defend our Paraguayan flank while we focus on the south."

argfor.6.t:0 "Bolivia Refuses to Help"
argfor.6.d:0 "The Bolivian government has announced that they will not aid our offensive against the Chilean people and has refused to further discuss the matter."
argfor.6.a:0 "We'll do it without them then!"

argfor.7.t:0 "Volunteers to Rome"
argfor.7.d:0 "The Holy See is under siege by the most decrepit human beings on the planet, the godless socialists of the Internationale. All that now stands against the red tide is the brave Papal garrison and their Italian ally. Thousands of young Argentinean men, however, have expressed their support for the Pope and are leaving our shores to fight the evil abroad. The Government has not yet made a clear statement regarding the situation but has seen its hand forced if it wants to keep the furious masses under control."
argfor.7.a:0 "Allow the Volunteers to fight."
argfor.7.b:0 "Organise a propaganda campaign to rouse the masses in favour of the Pope."

argfor.8.t:0 "Argentinean Volunteers Arrive in Rome"
argfor.8.d:0 "Outraged by the Syndicalist aggression and swept up by their government, thousands of young Argentinean men have arrived to give their life for the Holy See bringing with them a plenty of weapons and supplies to aid our troops."
argfor.8.a:0 "All of Christianity stands united!"

argfor.9.t:0 "Argentina Wants to Join the Reichspakt"
argfor.9.d:0 "After Carlés was deposed and the GOU stepped in to assume control, they have followed a German-friendly approach to Foreign Policy. With war brewing across our continent and thousands of Germans dying to Communard weapons, they have offered their support in the war and expressed their desire to formally join the alliance."
argfor.9.a:0 "Accept them."
argfor.9.b:0 "We don't need their help."

argfor.91.t:0 "Argentina Wants to Join the Reichspakt"
argfor.91.d:0 "Large interests in keeping our nation and, more importantly, our economy afloat have prompted the Argentinean regime to look beyond their own continent and apply for membership in the Reichspakt."
argfor.91.a:0 "Accept them."
argfor.91.b:0 "We don't need their help."

argfor.92.t:0 "Argentina Wants to Join the Entente"
argfor.92.d:0 "Large interests in keeping our nation and, more importantly, our economy afloat have prompted the Argentinean regime to look beyond their own continent and apply for membership in the Entente."
argfor.92.a:0 "Accept them."
argfor.92.b:0 "We don't need their help."

argfor.10.t:0 "Germany Accepts Our Offer"
argfor.10.d:0 "Their Kaiser has gladly accepted our offer and officially announced to the world yesterday that Argentina would join the Reichspakt."
argfor.10.a:0 "To Arms!"

argfor.102.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Offer"
argfor.102.d:0 "They have gladly accepted our offer and officially announced to the world yesterday that Argentina would join the Entente."
argfor.102.a:0 "To Arms!"

argfor.11.t:0 "Germany Refuses Our Offer"
argfor.11.d:0 "Surely the age of the Kaiser must have played a part in their decision making as our offer to assist them in the war was bluntly refused, with their minister questioning the capacity of our armed forces."
argfor.11.a:0 "We will remain neutral."

argfor.112.t:0 "Canada Refuses Our Offer"
argfor.112.d:0 "Surely the hubris of their King must have played a part in their decision making as our offer to assist them in the war was bluntly refused, with their minister questioning the capacity of our armed forces."
argfor.112.a:0 "We will remain neutral."

argfor.12.t:0 "Immigrants from the United States"
argfor.12.d:0 "As their homeland devolves in civil war and thousands die on the streets of the once great American nation for a defunct ideology, swarms of refugees from the States have departed from the East Coast setting sail for our nation. For years we have upheld a policy of open immigration and have actively attracted foreigners. Accepting refugees from the USA, however, could have unforeseen diplomatic implications and the rate at which they keep flowing in is putting a strain on our nation."
argfor.12.a:0 "Increase fees for entry."
argfor.12.b:0 "Encourage American Immigration."
argfor.12.c:0 "Close the border for American citizens."

argfor.13.t:0 "Victory on the Rio Negro!"
argfor.13.d:0 "The [ARG_rio_negro] that we withdraw from the river after recent border tensions escalated between forces of the Argentinean Army and the FOP militias. Even though we may not have gained any territorial concessions in the struggle, the action has been a great boost to our morale as our people realise that the enemy is not prepared for a full invasion."
argfor.13.a:0 "Onwards to Final Victory!"

argfor.20.t:0 "Defeat on the Rio Negro!"
argfor.20.d:0 "Our forces along the Rio Negro recently came into a border skirmish, suffering a defeat after tensions boiled over. Even though we suffered no territorial losses in the struggle, the defeat has caused a dip in morale as our people wonder if we can fight off a full invasion."
argfor.20.a:0 "We must redouble our efforts"

argfor.14.t:0 "Argentina Offers 'Protection'"
argfor.14.d:0 "As a vulture circles above its dying prey waiting for the right opportunity, so has Argentina closely watched as Brazil underwent major ideological changes. Unfit to protect us any longer and looking to even strike us first and reintegrate our proud nation, Brazil has become too dangerous to be left unopposed. Therefore, Argentina has proposed that they protect us from any harm caused by them...at a cost."
argfor.14.a:0 "We have no other choice."
argfor.14.b:0 "We can defend ourselves."

argfor.15.t:0 "Uruguay Refuses Our Proposal!"
argfor.15.d:0 "Trusting in their sacred neutrality, the Uruguayan government has refused our offer and told our diplomats that they will fend for themselves should war reach their nation."
argfor.15.a:0 "Respect their neutrality."
argfor.15.b:0 "Enforce our 'protection'"

argfor.16.t:0 "Military Coup in Argentina!"
argfor.16.d:0 "Continued hesitation to solve the FOP crisis has once again thrown the nation into chaos as military cliques have united to assert control over the nation. Vicious struggles in Buenos Aires, Cordoba and various other cities throughout the nation are still going on but it looks like our government has once again fallen. Fulfilling their promises of strong and direct leadership, the new military government has immediately declared war upon the FOP to once and for all end the crisis."
argfor.16.a:0 "Oh no!"

argfor.17.t:0 "Uruguay Accepts Our 'Protection'"
argfor.17.d:0 "Likely feeling threathened by our military might, the regime in Montevideo has wisely decided to fold their cards and accept our protection. Once more the Republic achieves a massive victory!"
argfor.17.a:0 "Huzzah!"

argfor.400.t:0 "[ARG.GetNameDefCap] Demands Us To Join Their Faction"
argfor.400.d:0 "With Brazil being subjugated by [ARG.GetNameDefCap], the balance of power in South America has radically changed. They are the strongest power on the continent now, and they abuse this status, demanding us to join their faction. This can provide us protection from possible threats, but this will mean aligning with ultra-nationalist Argentinian regime. They made their demands clear, and if we refuse, the invasion is imminent. What should we do?"
argfor.400.a:0 "We are in no position to contest Argentina."
argfor.400.b:0 "'Let them come.'"

argim.1.d:0 "Due to the collapse of the world economy in the wake of the Black Monday disaster and the rising tensions all over Europe, large swathes of immigrants have decided to cross the pond and search their fortune in our nation.

## Black Monday ##
argbla.1.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the Nation"
argbla.1.d:0 "When the German market opened this morning and the stocks suddenly started plummeting, our nation was one of the first to be hit by the wave. In response to the Berlin stock exchange, the Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires collapsed as well causing even more trouble for Carlés who is barely holding on to power."
argbla.1.a:0 "Argentina is thrown into a spiral of bad luck!"

argbla.2.t:0 "Closure of the Bolsa de Comercio?"
argbla.2.d:0 "With stocks continuing to plummet and investors all around the nation panicking, we could close the stock exchange and demand the banks to refuse to pay out desperate citizens. This will buy us some more time to fix the disaster while we are focusing on political affairs. However, the population will surely not be appreciate this"
argbla.2.a:0 "Close it!"
argbla.2.b:0 "The free market will fix this!"

argbla.3.t:0 "Close the Currency Board?"
argbla.3.d:0 "For most of our history, the currency board has tied the Peso to a gold standard where an organ called the Caja de Conversión was tasked with maintaining the value of our currency. With stocks plummeting and Germany taking decisive action to soften the blow, our exports have lost their competitive edge and are going to be struggling to compete with cheap Eastern European and domestic German products. Therefore, a proposal was offered to close the currency board and abandon the gold standard, letting the peso devaluate and making our products therefore competitive again."
argbla.3.a:0 "Close the board."
argbla.3.b:0 "Keep the board open."

argbla.31.t:0 "Exports Are Collapsing"
argbla.31.d:0 "Due to increasing competition from Europe and other parts of the world, our products have completely lost their competitive edge on the German market causing thousands of our citizens to lose their jobs due to the bankruptcy of many of our major companies."
argbla.31.a:0 "Try to soften the blow."

argbla.4.t:0 "Peso Spirals Downwards"
argbla.4.d:0 "With political insecurity in Argentina and massive economic troubles in the German Empire, the Peso keeps spiralling downwards forcing many of our old and powerful companies to close down and lay off thousands of workers. Government plans to intervene and save those without jobs are being drafted up but in the meantime, the situation goes from bad to worse."
argbla.4.a:0 "Strong intervention is a necessity!"

argbla.5.t:0 "Unrest in Cordoba and Mendoza"
argbla.5.d:0 "Caused by the economic recession and feeding off the political insecurity in our nation, thousands of jobless citizens in the industrial cities of Cordoba and Mendoza have flocked to the streets to demand the government to step in and fix the crisis. Since our control over these cities is still uncontested, local police forces loyal to the army are not intervening on our behalf in an attempt to fan the flames of resistance against the regime."
argbla.5.a:0 "Send a strongly worded letter."

argbla.6.t:0 "Revising Our Exports"
argbla.6.d:0 "After the victory by the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg and the fading importance of the British Empire, Argentina slowly started adjusting itself to the new world order and increased its exports to Germany. This turned out to be the correct choice as 1925 brought with it the collapse of the British Empire and the trade network it had established. As Argentina's prime export partner and the supplier of much of our needed goods, the government was forced to start a large scale industrialisation program leading to rising social tensions and a couple rough years.\n\nGerman investments and the increasing importance of our agricultural products turned the situation back around in the thirties, leading to an economic boom and the establishment of Argentina as an economic powerhouse on the continent. The crash of the German market however and the return of protectionism to the nation, have catastrophically impacted our economy and severely hampered our exports. A new trade agreement will have to be signed so we can get a guarantee from the German Empire that they'll keep importing our goods."

argbla.7.d:0 "As one of our largest import partners, the struggling republic of Argentina has reached out to our trade ministry begging us to make an exception on the increased tariffs we imposed on non-Mitteleuropean nations. Since their economy is virtually entirely dependent on us, we could put the squeeze on them and try to force them into signing a less favourable agreement.\n\nShould they, however, take this opportunity to shift their interests to the Entente, it would cut us off from their vital agricultural exports which could give our rivals in the Entente an advantage in the Americas."

argbla.72.t:0 "Germany Imposes Harsher Terms"
argbla.72.d:0 "Aware of our fragile situation and not willing to drag their own recovery down to assist us, the German trade ministry has demanded we lower the prices of our processed meat exports or face consequences by receiving higher prices on steel, tools and consumer goods.\n\nWe are, however, not obliged to follow these demands and could perhaps strike a deal with the Entente to reduce our dependence on Germany, although the Islas Malvinas issue has not fully been resolved yet and could prove to be a British bargaining chip."

argbla.72.b:0 "Maybe there is an alternative solution..."

argbla.73.t:0 "Argentina Comes to Bargain"
argbla.73.d:0 "Severely hit by Black Monday and forced by Germany to swallow a tough pill to save their economy, the government has come to us to strike a new trade agreement. Their vast agrarian exports have made them a key player on the global market and years of industrialisation after the fall of our empire have successfully turned them into a valuable asset for our trade network and possibly alliance.\n\nHowever, they also stole the Falkland Islands in our moment of weakness and this is an insult that doesn't sit well with the public at home. Should we force them to return the islands we would gain a massive amount of support from our followers but could risk an end to possible trade relations with the Republic."

argbla.75.t:0 "Canada Demands the Falkland Islands Back"
argbla.75.d:0 "While Canada would be willing to revise their broken treaties with us after the 1925 debacle, they have one simple demand before agreeing to discuss possible trade arrangements: The Islas Malvinas have to be returned to British control at once or there will be no possible deal, now or in the future. Not only are the islands an important naval facility in our fight against the FOP, returning the islands would cause massive outrage on the home front which we don't need with the already fragile state of our regime.\n\nInhabitants of the Islands have not been asked whose side they are on but it goes without saying that they have full faith in our capacity to make the right decision."

argbla.13.d:0 "Originally opened in 1913, the Buenos Aires underground was the first metro system on the South American continent and even in the entire Southern Hemisphere. Under a near monopoly of the AATC, little expansion was done in the last decades prompting the government to step in and transfer construction rights to the Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF). They went on to create a new line for the system, the Line D connecting Catedral to Tribunales.\n\nContinued emigration to the city from the impoverished countryside and the massive influx of European immigrants has left our public transportation system severely lacking which has led to the government proposal to nationalise the network into the Transport Corporation of Buenos Aires (CTCBA) to allow for better expansion and to meet the demands created by the population explosion of the city."

Three years later the club published a call for tenders to build its new stadium. Economic hardship due to the Black Monday disaster and the inability to find proper architects delayed the construction of the new stadium until 1938 when the club played their last match before the great work began.\n\nFinally opening on May 25, 1940, with a friendly match between Boca and San Lorenzo, the home side won 2-0 with both goals scored by Ricardo Alarcón. Even though the station was freshly built, it lacked a lighting system which forced the game to end by the 70th minute."

argcar.1.t:0 "Status of Argentina"
argcar.1.d:0 "By the early 20th century, Argentina was enjoying a booming and fast-growing economic prowess based on its meat and cereal exports. Immigrants from all over Europe flooded towards the Republic and vigorous entrepreneurship and a nascent industry quickly propelled Argentina forwards as one of the most prosperous nations on the planet. Trade relations were secure and exports to the United Kingdom and Germany kept increasing.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg however struck, Argentina was forced into neutrality unwilling to side with either its most important economic partner, the UK, or its second most important one, Germany. By steering between the two, sanctions were brought down by the British, enforcing an embargo on trade with Germany. While Argentina tried circumventing this by selling through third countries, the sales were not the same and the pre-WK miracle slowed down.\n\nAs the last years of the Weltkrieg approached, it became apparent to the UK that it was fighting a losing fight and ordered the Argentinean government and companies to ramp up production and exploit the nation to the fullest. Discontent with the increased demands and sick of British exploitation, the workers started to organise, protest and finally rise up in an armed revolt. Unable to fully contain the situation, the control of the Argentinean government on the uprisings went from bad to worse and by the mid-20s Argentina had lost control of Santa Cruz, Chubut and Rio Negro Provinces to the newly formed Frente Obrero Patagonico.\n\nThree subsequent democratically elected governments were tasked with solving the crisis but failed one after another. In response to their incapacity to rule, General Uriburu rose up in 1930 to attempt crushing the revolt. A reign of terror spread across the nation with socialist and syndicalist sympathisers massacred and pushed southwards. His dictatorship is however short lived as he dies from cancer two years later, forming a power vacuum and once more no large-scale intervention in the South."
argcar.1.a:0 "Very well."

argcar.100.d:0 "Elections are written out and through electoral fraud, the PAN under Roca successfully takes power, prompting a slow recovery from Uriburu's dictatorship and a changing attitude towards the FOP (Patagonian Workers Front). Small skirmishes into FOP territory are launched and the navy successfully retakes the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. Intervention from Chile, however, stops the government from achieving victory and temporarily ends the conflict with the FOP.\n\nWhen in 1935, rumours started surfacing that Roca may be attempting to end the conflict and leave the FOP alone, outrage across the nation erupts, enabling the Liga Patriotica under Manuel Carlés to gain the support they need - culminating in the Christmas Coup. Supported by the Navy and various military elements, Carlés coups the government on Christmas 1935, takes control over the capital region, and starts solidifying his hold on the nation.\n\nOn the first of January 1936, Carlés is still in the midst of his attempted coup - with success far from certain. Aside from the Buenos Aires capital region and a few small inland provinces, his control is nihil. Support from the ARA or 'Argentinean Armada' is guaranteed, but many of the military commanders in the Army doubt Carlés' potential and are organising to put down his coup."

argcar.2.t:0 "Clashes at the Colegio Militar de la Nación"
argcar.2.d:0 "As one of the last strongholds in the greater Buenos Aires region, the Colegio Militar de la Nación was occupied by loyalist members of the military who had barricaded themselves inside the compound awaiting reinforcements from the interior. In response to this last-ditch effort, soldiers of the ARA were sent in to try and push them out. While small clashes occurred throughout the compound, the Army surrendered a week later when their basic utilities and will to hold out had started to fade.\n\nAmongst the captured were a few notable Army commanders but it seems that the majority of the staff had fled the city during the first days of the Coup. This victory may be insignificant in the greater picture but we now firmly control the entirety of Buenos Aires."

argcar.3.t:0 "Fight for the Estación Retiro"
argcar.3.d:0 "As the primary railway hub of our nation, the city of Buenos Aires plays a key role in connecting the vast swathes of land of our country. Most of the Northern railroads, however, pass through Rosario, which has not yet declared its allegiance to Carlés and may prove a thorn in our side during the Northern campaign. Our troops are currently finishing up the loyalist remnants in the Estación Retiro in Buenos Aires but we will have to decide whether we have the ARA secure the coastline and its populous cities or the Rosario hub first."
argcar.3.a:0 "Push towards Rosario."
argcar.3.b:0 "Send the ARA to Mar del Plata."

argcar.4.t:0 "Gendarmería Nacional Argentina"
argcar.4.d:0 "With questionable support from the army and the limited manpower of the ARA, a debate has arisen about the capabilities of our internal strike force. According to the Argentinean Constitution, the armed forces can technically not intervene in internal civil conflicts, so the Gendarmerie would be created as an organ subordinate to the Defence Ministry and thus the Carlés cabinet. It would be defined as a civilian "security force of a military nature" and maintain a functional relationship with the Ministry of Defence, as part of both the National Defence System and the Interior Security System. It would, therefore, maintain capabilities arising from the demands required by joint military planning with the armed forces and would legally be able to intervene in the current crisis.\n\nOur funds are, however, limited at this time and the loyalty of the new recruits would be questionable at best which has made Carlés reconsider the proposal to avoid the possibility of a counter-coup from within his own ranks."
argcar.4.a:0 "Found the GNA."
argcar.4.b:0 "We can deal with the situation on our own."

argcar.5.t:0 "Intervention in the Judiciary branch"
argcar.5.d:0 "During the early years of the twentieth century, our nation started to slowly move away from the old authoritarian systems towards a more open and democratic system by changes to the constitution and the implementation of checks and balances. The subsequent separatism in Patagonia, the continued corruption in government and the shady dealings of the conservative ruling party, however, have stumped our progress and kept the old system alive and striving. Not only has this led to great disgruntlement amongst the people, it has also created a hotbed for Carlés supporters who claim the High Court is obstructing "popular will".\n\nWith Carlés and his supporters now in control of the High Court, it has given him the perfect opportunity to strike the defunct system by relieving all 5 members of the Court from their duties and to replace them by his "men of the people". We can, however, further push our narrative and start replacing the lower courts as well with our followers, although this might backfire greatly should the people turn sides."
argcar.5.a:0 "The old system is outdated and corrupt!"

argcar.50.t:0 "Question of Civil Rights"
argcar.50.d:0 "Many of our supporters are convinced that we aren't rooting out the old guard efficiently enough and have pushed for a temporary restriction on the constitutional rights of our citizens.

argcar.50.b:0 "The constitution grants rights that cannot be taken."

argcar.51.t:0 "Protests in Buenos Aires"
argcar.51.d:0 "As a reaction to our decision to temporarily lift the constitution to pursue the dissenters, thousands of our citizens have flocked to the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires to protest against these changes and proclaim their support for the old government. While this doesn't come as a surprise, we hadn't expected the protests to rise up this quickly. This puts a serious dent in the plans to secure the Argentinean hinterland and could potentially buy the conservative forces the time they need to form an organised opposition."
argcar.51.a:0 "Send in the Gendarmería."
argcar.51.b:0 "Station the reserves in Buenos Aires."

argcar.52.t:0 "Escalation in Buenos Aires"
argcar.52.d:0 "The protests in the capital suddenly turned violent when the armed forces were sent in with stones being thrown at our riot forces. An unskilled rookie opened fire on the protestors in response causing the whole situation to explode in a bloody mess where dozens of civilians were shot in an effort to control the crowd. The hard crackdown inevitably led to the dispersion of the crowds and dozens of arrests but has shown the weakness of the Carlés regime in quelling these protests."

An intervention force shall be sent to the province to restore order and to arrest all contra revolutionaries that are refusing to accept rule from Buenos Aires."

argcar.7.t:0 "Mendoza and Entre Rios Side with Cordoba"
argcar.7.d:0 "Following the example of Cordoba, the states of Mendoza and Entre Rios have also denounced Carlés and taken the side of the military. While this is a devastating blow to our legitimacy and power in the outer provinces, the Army is still too disorganised to actively pursue us."

argcar.8.t:0 "Capture of Mar del Plata"
argcar.8.d:0 "As the ARA approached the coastline of Mar del Plata and launched a warning salvo to deter any military presence in the city from fighting back, the city officially surrendered to admiral Videla at 12 am.

argcar.9.d:0 "Insurgents from the city of Rosario have sabotaged the railway connection to the capital in an effort to slow our forces down and buy them more time to organise against us. Especially the station of San Nicolas was hit hard and has caused much of our planned movements to become impossible to achieve. The fall of momentum in our movement and the rising threat of an organised military opposition to Carlés has forced us to reconsider other options. The Grupo de Oficiales Unidos holds vast control over the Army and has not yet chosen with whom to side with which could make them a valuable asset in our struggle. Convincing them will not be easy though as they are set to play an influential role in politics and might even directly interfere in our policies both abroad and on the home front."

Fully entrenched, well supplied and with strategic support from the GOU, the city was prepared against any offensive which was proven when the initial attempts to take the city were snuffed out quickly and efficiently. The Panzers that were brought in from Buenos Aires to support the assailants proved to be ineffective in the small streets of the city and skirmishes in the Villa Diego and Saladillo quickly became disasters for the attackers. By the end of the 10-day struggle for the city, supplies and morale of the Carlés forces ran out and the commanding officer formally surrendered to the GOU effectively ending the fight for Rosario and by extension the campaign to pacify the hinterlands."

argcar.11.d:0 "Surprised by the quick reaction of our troops and ill-prepared to take on our forces, the city fell after only small skirmishes in the centre of the city. While not much of the rebel leadership was captured in the attack, the moral implications of the victory are great, prompting Mar Del Plata and Concordia to immediately surrender to the central government. They are also fear retaliation should they side with the rebels. Material damage to the city is fairly limited due to the excellent reaction of our troops but the important railway hub that we hoped to capture was bombed just before our arrival to prevent us from quickly taking the other cities."

As his minister of Foreign Affairs, he has chosen the infamous Estanislao Zeballos whose literary works have had a profound impact on our nation and whose loyalty to the LP goes without question. Diego Isidro Masón has been chosen to serve as minister of economic affairs due to his close ties with the rest of the armed forces and to personally oversee the rapid militarisation of the Argentinean war machine. As the minister of Interior Affairs, Carlés has chosen another military man in the form of Elbio Anaya who has played an important role in the first days of the Patagonia rebellion but was unable to complete his task due to the failures of his superior Colonel Héctor Benigno Varela."

Being allied to Carlés during the early days of his regime, the GOU has politely requested Carlés to tone down his recklessness before he drags Argentina down with him. Controlling vast parts of our armed forces, we cannot risk angering the GOU as they could lift us from power just as easily as they helped us seize it so we will either have to bow to their request and stop with the campaign or take the radical approach of removing the organisation from power with force."

Organised by members of the GOU, General Ramírez took up the lead of the coup, quickly organising their forces to seize key locations in the city before Carlés could react. With the majority of the loyalist soldiers on the borders planning the next offensive, little to no troops were left in the Buenos Aires region leading to a quick and decisive strike on government facilities. Upon arriving at the Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics in the neighbourhood of Núñez, the group was attacked by loyal forces who were entrenched there, resulting in the death of 30 and the wounding of 100 but ultimately the surrender of the ARA forces.\n\nHaving surrendered the Navy School of Mechanics, the remaining Argentinean generals received the rebel leaders and declared Ramírez president of the Republic by noon. Carlés, while able to escape the rebel troops, boarded a small fishing trawler and set off to Peru in the hopes of finding an ally in their regime."

While his trial is being prepared in Buenos Aires, President Ramírez has officially requested his extradition from Peru. Accused of High Treason, corruption and other crimes against the Argentinean State, it is fairly clear that his extradition would lead to an immediate incarceration and the end of his political career."

Ramírez has answered with the forced expulsion of Peruvian diplomats from Buenos Aires and has threatened Peru with economic sanctions should they not comply with our demands.

argcar.48.d:0 "As the trials against the treacherous revolutionaries are being carried out, a stand out case has been picked up by the press and is spreading through the nation like wildfire. Liborio Justo, son of the General and Chief of Staff Agustin P. Justo, had fled to the Frente Obrero Patagonico in 1930, taking with him many military manuals from El Palomar, and helping make the FOP's military stronger. Accused of treason, some judges had suggested the death penalty and that's where General Agustin P. Justo decided to intervene. Arguing against the execution, Justo is coming off to the public as a voice of reason, critizicing the government for being overly harsh and potentially inspiring yet another uprising. While passing the guilty sentence is still on the table, many on the cabinet are well aware of Agustin P. Justo's deep connections into both the Army and the UCRA, and advise us to treat the matter with precaution."

argcar.30.d:0 "Following the ascension of Ramírez to the presidency and the increased persecution of union members and Liga Patriotica sympathisers, hundreds of our citizens have crossed the Uruguayan border in an attempt to flee justice. The government has decreed extra reinforcements to the border guard and has deployed further divisions of the Gendarmería to assist while patrol boats of the Prefectura are sailing in front of the Uruguayan coast to pick up any refugee ships."
argcar.30.a:0 "No one shall escape Justice!"

argcar.31.t:0 "Crackdown on the FOIC"
argcar.31.d:0 "The Federación Obrera de la Industria de la Carne or Meat Industry Workers Federation has been banned by presidential decree this morning leading to the closure of the FOIC offices in Berrios and Avellaneda and the subsequent arrestation of the leadership, most notably Secretary General José Peter.\n\nThe organisation has been closely linked to syndicalist cells in our nation but were mostly unharmed by the previous administration after previous strikes organised by them led to a dangerous economic crisis in the meat packing industry. An organised reaction against this move and strikes across the nation are to be expected but are necessary to avoid the red menace from taking control."
argcar.31.a:0 "We can not let syndicalism overtake our nation!"

argcar.32.t:0 "Dissolution of the CGT"
argcar.32.d:0 "Following the persecution of the FOIC, the Confederación General del Trabajo de la República Argentina or General Confederation of Labour of the Argentinean Republic has now also been dissolved by Ramírez in his pledge to eradicate all socialist elements in the nation and remove the basis of organised resistance. Centred mostly around the railroads and having experienced a split due to the conflict in the FOP, the CGT has slowly started to establish itself as the largest union of our nation.\n\nWith their dissolution, the socialists once again lose an important pillar of their power. The more than 100.000 members of the organisation though are sure to organise resistance and with the already rising tensions between the unions and the government due to the Black Monday disaster, this move could be very dangerous to the stability of our nation."
argcar.32.a:0 "Push for further regularisation of the unions."

argcar.33.t:0 "The Government Takes over the Littoral"
argcar.33.d:0 "In line with the political agenda of Ramírez, the management of education has been handed over to the right-wing Hispanic-Catholic nationalists. By a decisive action by the government, the National University of the Littoral was seized and Jordán Bruno Genta instated as its supervisor. Genta, known for his far-right and anti-reformist ideas, maintains that the country needs to create "an intelligent aristocracy, nourished by Roman and Hispanic lineage" to lead the nation to greatness.\n\nThe University Federation of the Littoral responded vehemently against the appointment of Genta calling it a violation of the 1918 university act which guaranteed governing autonomy and academic freedom. Government forces immediately responded to these accusations by detaining its secretary general and expelling students and professors who protested in opposition."
argcar.33.a:0 "All institutions must be controlled."

argcar.34.t:0 "General Strike!"
argcar.34.d:0 "Organised by FOIC cadres after mass meetings in Rosario, Avellaneda and Berrios, a strike petition was issued calling for the liberation of Peter and the demand for 30 hours of guaranteed work a week. The management of the meat industry refused these terms and in response, a general strike was called throughout the nation paralysing the vital sector. Gendarmería had been sent in to quell the strikers and force them back to work but clashes between government forces and protesters quickly escalated, leading to hard oppression by the police forces and the arrestation of dozens of strikers.\n\nPersonal intervention however by Perón has made the Unions and management come to a fragile agreement followed by the release of Peter to calm the masses down. Part of these negotiations, however, led to the new Autonomous Butcher's Union of Berisso and Ensenada, in open opposition to the FOIC."
argcar.34.a:0 "This Colonel seems to know what he's doing."

argcar.35.t:0 "Second FOIC Crackdown"
argcar.35.d:0 "Due to reinvigorated issues between the management and the union concerning meeting the new economic demands, negotiations once again broke down which has prompted us to immediately seize the offices of the FOIC again and the further arrestation of key FOIC figures amongst whom Peter who was just released. With this action, the Union has been near completely destroyed. Lack of funds, the loss of their leadership and the planned deportation of their leader Peter have made the organisation dissolve giving room to new unions, preferably ours, to expand and take their territory."
argcar.35.a:0 "Slowly but surely our grasp becomes more secure."

argcar.36.t:0 "Ramírez Takes over the Railway Unions"
argcar.36.d:0 "Even though the Unions have been legalised now by Ramírez, a clause was included which lets the government take over any union at will. The powerful railroad union, which formed the foundation of the CGT was the first to fall under this new policy and has been placed under direct government control. A so-called "inventor" has been placed in the organisation as the supervisor but is more a direct extension of the government than an independent agent.\n\nStrikes against this move almost immediately followed but were put down hard by the Gendarmería who have arrested dozens more influential socialist leaders. The Unions, however, have started to change direction sensing that the new government is heavily anti-union and therefore a group under Ángel Borlenghi has approached Colonel Domingo Mercante to sit down and come to a peaceful resolution."
argcar.36.a:0 "Mercante accepts the offer."

argcar.37.t:0 "Mercante and the Unions reach an accord"
argcar.37.d:0 "Represented by Ángel Borlenghi, Francisco Pablo Capozzi and Juan Atilio Bramuglia, the Unions opted, albeit with reservations and distrust, to establish relations with a sector of the military government more inclined to accept union demands, with the aim of forming an alliance capable of influencing the course of events. To achieve initial contact with the military they chose Colonel Domingo Mercante, the son of an important railroad union leader and member of the GOU, to represent the government and hopefully persuade him to listen to the Unions. In turn, Mercante summoned his political partner and close friend, Juan Perón, a colonel and member of the GOU.\n\nWhile the negotiations were tough, the proposal of the Unions that the military created a Secretariat of Labour, strengthen a now loyal CGT and sanction a series of labour laws that would accept the historical claims of the Argentinean labour movement was positively received by the colonels. They, however, demanded the immediate release of Peter, who was imprisoned earlier this year when the army rolled up the FOIC."
argcar.37.a:0 "Finally something we can work with."

argcar.38.t:0 "Secretary of Labour Perón"
argcar.38.d:0 "After his success to broker a deal between the unions and the military government, Perón was granted the office of Head of the Department of Labour. A completely empty position with no power, we hoped this would keep the ambitious colonel busy and blocked from any further rise in politics. He however successfully fulfilled the office and even gave it a new meaning by approving the labour laws that had been claimed historically by the Argentinean labour movement (extending the severance indemnity that existed since 1934 for commerce employees, pensions for commerce employees, a multi-clinic hospital for railway workers, technical schools for workers, the prohibition of employment agencies, the creation of the labour courts, Christmas bonuses), lending efficacy to the existing labour inspectors and impelling for the first time collective bargaining, which grew to become the basic way of regulating the relationship between capital and labour. Moreover, he forced us to drop the decree regarding unions associations sanctioned by president Ramírez in the first weeks of the revolution, which was criticised by the entire labour movement.\n\nIn addition, Perón, Mercante, and the initial group of unionists who formed the alliance began to organize a new union that would assume a nationalist-labour identity. The group assumed an anti-syndicalist position already existing in parts of the old CGT and, relying on the power of the Secretary of Labour, organized new unions in the industries which lacked them (chemicals, electricity, tobacco) and set up rival unions in industries with powerful old and hostile to the government, unions (meat, construction, textiles, metallurgy)."

Ramírez, unwilling to back down now and risk the anger of German diplomats has not yet taken a decision but must do so quickly if he wishes to remain in power. His own vice-president, Edelmiro Farrell has expressed his desire to stay neutral and could provide a thorn in our side, should we join the Germans in their war."

A heavy blow to the legitimacy of Farrell, many fear that the slumbering military cells opposed to the new direction of the government could wake up and attempt to overthrow the president."

argcar.44.d:0 "Just one week later, the nation was shaken up by one of the strangest yet influential events in Argentinean history. An unfamiliar social class, which had remained completely absent from Argentinean history until then, burst into Buenos Aires and demanded Perón's freedom. The city was taken by tens of thousands of workers from the industrial areas that had been growing on the outskirts of the city. The crowd set itself up in the Plaza de Mayo and refused to leave until their demands were met. It was characterized by the large number of young people and especially women who were part of it, and by the predominance of people with hair and skin darker than those who attended the traditional political acts of the time. The anti-Peronist opposition stressed these differences, referring to them in derogatory terms such as "blacks", "fat people", " descamisados (shirtless)", "cabecitas negras". It was the Radical Unionist leader Sammartino who even went so far as to call the event a "zoo flood".\n\nThe protestors were accompanied by a whole new generation of young people and new union delegates belonging to the unions of the CGT, which had responded to a sugar workers' strike two days earlier. It was a completely peaceful demonstration, but the political and cultural upheaval was of such heft that, in a few hours, the triumph of the anti-Peronist movement had been cancelled out, as did the remaining power of the military government.\n\nAfter intense negotiations, the radical Armando Antille distinguished himself as Perón's delegate leading to his liberation. That same night Perón addressed his sympathizers from a balcony at the Casa Rosada and praised their dedication and patriotism."

As a cadet, along with many other students and UCR members, he took part in the 'Revolución del Parque' which asked for greater democratic representation and the end of fraud that plagued Argentinean elections. He was arrested and then amnestied, managing to graduate in 1892 with the rank of second lieutenant and keeping many of the UCR contacts he met during the revolt. Without leaving his military career, he began studying engineering in the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires', becoming a military engineer in 1904. He was appointed as Headmaster of the 'El Palomar' military school in 1915, and minister of war in 1922 thanks to his connections within the 'UCRA'. He took part in the 1930's coup that Uriburu staged against Yrigoyen and has since then remained an influential figure within the army, with many looking up to him within the armed forces as he remains one of the few officers who wants the army to stay out of the political landscape.\n§YImportant Notes:§W His son, Liborio, ran off to the FOP when they rebelled.

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_JOHN_STEINBECK_DESC:0 "The face of a united coalition of radicals and moderates, Mayor Steinbeck has unified a group of varied Leftists that have rallied behind his broad Socialist banner after taking a vow to pursue peaceful reformation within a democratic system as opposed to the bloody revolutionary activity consuming the former USA. Born in California in 1902, Steinbeck came under the tutelage of marine biologist and philosopher Ed Ricketts after graduating college. Together, they toured America and even Indochina to explore the plight of the common man as well as revolutionary activity. After returning to America, he traveled to NYC and began writing his breakout literary works as chaos began to consume the nation in the years leading up to the Second American Civil War during the Great Depression and later Black Monday. \n\nThough a strong politician, Steinbeck is best known for his recent literary work 'In Dubious Battle' in which he writes about a strike that was both helped and hindered by an unnamed party that has generally been interpreted to be Jack Reed and Bill Haywood's Syndicalist Party. This novel largely encapsulates Steinbeck's approach to New York City politics; despite a feeling of abandonment in the form of the Syndicalist Party's abandonment of figures like Steinbeck, he is still determined to fight for the righteous causes in the city. Steinbeck has won the position of mayor of New York fair and square, mostly off of the support of the city's leftists, but he must now carefully position his city in the national struggle. Though he has clearly distanced himself from Chicago in some regards, he would be foolish to burn all his bridges on that front, and internationally, the Internationale is more than willing to provide support. So, with his ragtag group of supporters, Steinbeck plans to do what he does best as an artist. He will stand up to the stones of condemnation and speak for those who were never given a voice in Tammany Hall or the city as a whole before."
POLITICS_FIORELLO_H_LA_GUARDIA_DESC:0 "Fiorello La Guardia, the Italian mayor of New York whose heart is only equalled by his desire to fight for the people of his city, faces his toughest challenge yet. If it wasn't enough that the country was in ruins, now his city faces internal division and chaos. Brother fights brother, and the city he loves most teeters on the edge. Surprisingly though, La Guardia seems unphased. Just as he confronted Tammany Hall early in his administration, the 'Little Flower' now confronts the destructive forces of extremism and uncompromising politics in New York City. La Guardia has rounded up the sane residents of the city (however many of those are left) and declared that if the national government is unwilling or unable to solve the problems facing the city, he will do so himself. He had high hopes for George Norris, a close ally of his, but now La Guardia is alone. However, his crusading spirit and anger towards those who would wrong the common man has done him a great service, lending him the credibility to become the most powerful force in the city, at least for now. Even still, the 99th Mayor of New York City has his work cut out for him if he wishes to see his vision of a more just government enacted in the city, and he will have to face both radicals, reactionaries, and opportunists to get the job done."
POLITICS_ORSON_WELLES_DESC:0 "Orson Welles, one of the greatest actors alive today, has now turned his considerable energy towards the political sphere. Though Welles espouses policies some would identify more closely with syndicalism than either of the two major parties, Welles does have strong disagreements with the more radical components of the city. Given his unique position, Welles has portrayed himself as someone who can bring together the disparate factions of the city and this is reflected in his supporters, who come from various identities but all support his vision for reform. Welles hopes to fight the abuses of the NYPD and Tammany Hall while simultaneously giving power back to the people of the city. In this endeavor, it would not be the power of chaos that he would be granting; it would be the power for the people to speak their minds as they see fit in a world in which Welles sees only a few who are allowed to speak. Of course, as an actor, Welles knows a thing or two about speech."
POLITICS_FRED_TRUMP_DESC:0 "Fred Trump has made a name for himself in recent years as a businessman with the drive and ambition to build a fortune in personal wealth. In the housing industry, he has shown a prenchant for ruthlessness as well as a certain shrewdness that has won him many admirers. With this newfound support, Trump now looks to save his city. After all, a stable city is a productive city, and stability is good for business. To achieve this though, the city will need to slowly rebuild from the ashes, and Fred Trump has a plan to make this a reality. It is essential that the city's outdated housing and tax policies be overhauled, but it is equally essential in Trump's eyes that Catholic influence in the NYPD should be removed. In the mayor's eyes, they are a significant force holding back the native Protestant Americans from bringing the city towards the greatness it should enjoy today. Beyond these small goals lies the wider vision of privatization in the city, with businesses flooding in as much as immigrants used to. Though he is celebrated for his abilities in the business world, it remains to be seen whether he can transfer this success to the political realm. One way or another though, one of Trump's most famous quotes is that if you do anything, it should be something you love, and Trump certainly loves to see profitable outcomes..."
POLITICS_HOLSTEIN_DESC:0 "Born with the name Egbert Joseph in 1876 in what was the Dutch East Indies on the island of St. Croix, Casper Holstein took the name of his father later in life before immigrating to the mainland United States shortly after the Yanks came to control what was now the U.S Virgin Islands. Settling in Harlem before getting involved in his life of crime, Holstein was one of the main masterminds behind the widespread usage and increased profitability of numbers rackets - simple numerically-based games designed to scam quick and easy cash. Rising alongside his rival Stephanie St. Clair, the two came to battle for dominance in Harlem before temporarily setting aside their differences in order to claim the Big Apple for themselves. An adamant follower of Marcus Garvey and a follower of both UNIA and TUUL ideology as well as the ‘Mobster Populism’ espoused by Al Capone and Lucky Luciano, Holstein seeks to create a Social National Negro state in NYC built on crime, egalitarianism, and populist economics."
POLITICS_STCLAIR_DESC:0 "Born in the former French West Indies before immigrating to Quebec after the death of her mother, St. Clair moved to the United States shortly before the dawn of the Great War. After falling into criminal activity, she bounced around with a bad crowd for a few years, nearly being sold in prostitution before returning to Harlem to found her own criminal enterprise. Rising to the top of Harlem’s underworld alongside her rival Casper Holstein using her sharp wit, calculating mind, and knack for turning a profit with numbers games that propelled her career. Supported by her husband - the Islamic-Buddhist mystic Sufi Abdul Hamid - and her right-hand man Bumpy Johnson as well as by her gang the 40 Thieves, Madame St. Clair shall build a new shining city on the hill here in the Big Apple - one built on non-corrupt criminal enterprise, liberal capitalist socio-economics, and civil rights."
POLITICS_OLVANY_DESC:0 "One of the many Bosses within the Society of St. Tammany, George Washington Olvany has been chosen to be the face of this shadowy political machine. Though behind the scenes he is subservient to higher powers, to the public he is a strong and dominant Mayor backed by the might of Tammany Hall. Born in 1876 to a comfortable Irish family, Olvany joined up with Tammany Hall after receiving a law degree. His agenda shall be guided by his conservative record as a hard judge and corrupt businessman, once accused of extorting money from clients, and is expected to do the bidding of the Tammany Tiger without hesitation."
POLITICS_TAMMANNY_DESC:0 "Officially the Society of St. Tammany, the Sons of St. Tammany, or the Columbian Order, what is commonly called Tammany Hall is a Democratic Party-aligned political machine dominated by the Irish and WASPs of New York. First founded in 1789, Tammany Hall controls Democratic votes and wields tremendous amounts of influence in the City and beyond - particularly among Irish and Anglo citizens. Under the infamous ‘Boss Tweed,’ its corruption became public and since then it has only gotten more and more reviled, with rumors of their mob ties and other unscrupulous activities abound. The society once held a dominant stranglehold on New York democracy, winning most mayoral elections over the span of decades. However, after a few devastating investigations and the collapse of Arnold Rothstein’s crime empire that supported them under the table, Tammany Hall fell from prominence. The final blow was delivered after Fiorello La Guardia won the election for Mayor in 1933. \n\nSince then Tammany Hall has been on the backfoot - that is, until now. Seizing control of the Big Apple during the chaos following our hastey declaration of independence, Tammany Hall is still hated by millions, but there is little anyone can do about it. Ready to once again dominate NYC with their fellow Irish Catholic allies and attack dogs in the NYPD, Tammany Hall and its shadowy cabal of bosses and politicians are ready to restore the Big Apple’s reputation as a wealthy, elite, and conservative metropolis as they rot it to the core with their corruptive influence."
POLITICS_WALKER_DESC:0 "Known colloquially as Beau James, James John ‘Jimmy’ Walker has once again risen to be Mayor of NYC, once holding it in 1926 before being forced to resign after a damning corruption investigation. However, his experience and his connection to the people of New York is undeniable, for this flamboyant and charismatic Liberal Democrat has a silver tongue to match his silver spoon. Born to the elite Irish Walker family in 1881, Walker has lived the easy life, graduating from a good school despite self-proclaimed stories that his childhood was marred by poverty. Joining up with the Society of St. Tammany after graduating college and entering politics, Tammany’s resurgence has allowed him to wipe his recond clean as he rises to become Mayor once again. Under his rule, he shall guide NYC on a more liberal path while still remaining obedient to his puppet masters of the higher bosses within Tammany’s darkest underbellies."
POLITICS_LEWIS_VALENTINE_DESC:0 "Serving as Police Chief and Chief Commissioner of the NYPD since his appointment by La Guardia in 1934, Lewis Joseph Valentine is dedicated to protecting and serving the people of this fine city with his Boys in Blue. Born in 1882, Valentine joined up with the Force in 1903 at just 21 years old. Since then, he has risen to the very top of the Department’s hierarchy thanks to his crusade against corruption, graft, and organized crime. Though he faces many tough enemies like those in Tammany Hall and the American Mafia, there are few, if any, men more capable to clean up the Big Apple than Chief Valentine."
POLITICS_WALLANDER_DESC:0 "Rising to the plate after the retirement of his mentor and friend Chief Valentine, Arthur William Wallander, Sr. is the new Police Chief and Chief Commissioner of the NYPD. Born in 1892 in NYC to Swedish immigrants, Wallander joined the NYPD right out of high school. Dedicated to the same anti-corruption principles as his mentor and predecessors as well as a friend of La Guardia, Wallander is expected to largely follow the status quo set up by Valentine. However, some have whispered that Chief Wallander is already in the pocket of outside forces, though if this is true remains to be seen."
POLITICS_LUCIANO_NYC_DESC:0 "Born Salvatore Lucania in Sicily in 1897 before immigrating to the United States through Ellis Island with his family as a boy, Charles ‘Lucky’ Luciano has since risen to become the most dominant crime lord in New York’s long history of organized crime. Seeking to make money for his family and his people who were discriminated against in the Big Apple, Luciano would travel across America taking advantage of certain states passing prohibition laws in order to bootleg, eventually falling in with Al Capone’s Chicago Outfit. After being betrayed by Capone’s ceaseless ambition and madness, Luciano would flee back to his adopted home of NYC, rising to the top after defeating Salvatore Maranzano in the wake of the Castellammarese Crime War with the help of his Five Points Gang. Later, he would go on to establish the Commission with long-time associate and friend Meyer Lansky. Together, the two would end the war between the Five Families and other lesser gangs throughout NYC as he moved to make the American Mafia a respected and feared organization more profitable than any criminal empire ever before, all while stopping senseless violence and rivalries between the gangs and while taking care of each and every innocent soul in our metropolis. Though he may favor Italian Catholics and his Jewish allies, and though he holds conservative views while being one of the most successful criminals in American history, Lucky Luciano is dedicated to running his National Crime Syndicate with respect while following tradition and mobster moral codes and ethics, all while making more money than God."
POLITICS_LANSKY_DESC:0 "Widely known as the Mob’s Accountant due to his legendary bookkeeping skills and aptitude for turning a dime and making a profit anywhere, Meyer Lansky - born Meier Suchowlanski in the old Russian Empire in 1902 - has stepped up to unify the warring organized crime groups within New York City. Moving to New York as a child with his Polish-Jew family, Meyer Lansky fell in with future members of the Jewish Mob such as his close friend Bugsy Siegel who he would go on to form the Bugs and Meyer Mob and eventually Murder, Inc. With a reputation as the brain behind one of the most violent criminal gangs in American history, Lansky may seem like a bloodthirsty tyrant, but in fact he is one of the most level headed and calculating members within the Commission. With his longtime ally and friend Lucky Luciano, along with Bugsy Siegel and the rest of the Commission’s member organizations, Lansky seeks to legitimize the American Mafia into a national crime syndicate in order to reach new heights of security and profits while uniting the warring factions for the good of all New Yorkers."
POLITICS_SIEGEL_DESC:0 "A fan of gambling and entertainment like none other, Benjamin ‘Bugsy’ Siegel’ and his gang of thugs and killers for hire Murder, Inc. have seized control of the Commission and the Big Apple in order to eliminate all competition so that all profits and benefits of both New York and our international criminal network go directly into their pockets. Born in Brooklyn to poor Ashkenazi Jews in 1906, Bugsy Siegel is the only one of the three dominant bosses of the Commission to be born in America. Entering the criminal world while just a preteen, Siegel has been immersed in violence and bloodshed since before his 13th birthday, and has long held deep ties to the Jewish and Italian criminal outfits that dominated NYC as a killer for hire and gambling expert. Forming first the Bugs and Meyer Mob with childhood friend Meyer Lansky before eventually transforming it into Murder, Incorporated before joining Luciano’s Commission, Siegel now stands as the most powerful man in NYC. With a dream of building a gambling and racketeering empire that spreads across all of America and beyond, Bugsy Siegel is as fierce and determined as he is cutthroat and calculating, so woe be to any foolish enough to stand in his way."
POLITICS_FDR_JR_DESC:0 "Few names carry more weight in modern American politics than Roosevelt, even with the fractured state of the former Union, for the Roosevelts have served America and her people proudly for generations. Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. is just one member of this esteemed family, and yet he has sought out on his own in order to blaze his own path. Born in August 1914, FDR Jr. was birthed into a world aflame, but lived a sheltered life in New York despite being born while his parents were vacationing in Canada. Upon the untimely death of his father when FDR Jr. and his siblings were only children, he and his brothers were taken in by close family friends in England shortly after their successful revolution, while his sister was left in the care of their mother Eleanor. Living abroad with his new adoptive family the Mosleys in London, the young FDR Jr. grew up with his brothers in a rapidly evolving revolutionary environment. All of them took to the regimented life of the early Revolution well, and were quickly swept up in the Red Wave. However, it was FDR Jr. that grew closest to their new caretaker Oswald Mosely, becoming deeply invested in the Maximist cause. With the rise of an independent New York City, FDR Jr. rallied his brothers to his new cause - to bring Mosley’s Maximism form-fit for Americans to the Big Apple. Though still a young man, this firebrand is fierce, cunning, and dedicated to the cause, now leading his brothers and other like-minded Totalists and Communists in New York City on a blazing path towards an egalitarian and totalitarian Maximist utopia."
POLITICS_HARRISON_DESC:0"Hailed as the ‘Black Socrates’ of New York, Hubert Harrison is the foremost figure of Black Socialism in the Big Apple. Born in 1883 in St. Croix in what is now the U.S. Virgin Islands, Hubert Harrison was born to freed slaves and lived a life of poverty alongside his lifelong friend and fellow Socialist D. Hamilton Jackson. Together, the two went through school together while enriching themselves with the knowledge of Socialist theory and African culture. At age 17 in 1900, Harrison would leave his island home and travel to another group of islands - the metropolis of New York City. Here, he moved in with his older sister who had come to America earlier, but was immediately hit with the realities of racially oppressive Jim Crow America. Horrified by rampant lynchings and race crimes rising in frequency across the nation, Harrison fully dove into his work of social and civil activism while working a string of low-paying, labor-intesive jobs and attending night school. \nAlways gifted with a genius-level intellect, school came easy to Harrison despite these challenges, and after graduating he has continued to be an astute autodidact in multiple fields ranging from history and sociology to philosophy and theory. After marrying his wife Irene in 1909 and working in the City for a decade, Harrison began sending letters to the New York Times and other papers about topics he felt needed addressing such as civil rights or Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, Harrison became further disgruntled with the world, furthering his dive into Socialism modeled on W.E.B. Du Bois, as well as into the freethought movement, agnostic atheism, Georgism, and the blooming Harlem Renaisance where he would help start the New Negro Movement. Continuing to work tirelessly for decades, Harrison would go on a political odyssey like none other; first supporting then renouncing the Garvey Movement for its hateful rhetoric, finding allies in groups like the AFL and NAACP, and even making new enemies such as the Black nationalist radical Ira Kemp or the ‘White pet’ Booker T. Washington. Through it all, even facing a brush with death during appendicitis surgery that nearly killed him, Hubert Harrison has not given up the fight to bring honor and respect to his distinct peoples while also fighting for equality and Socialism for all - a perseverance that has made him one of the most popular faces around. With the City that Never Sleeps now in his hands, it is up to the ingenious, humanistic, freethinking Socrates of Harlem to save New York City."
POLITICS_CROSSWAITH_DESC:0 "Born in 1892 in what used to be the Danish West Indies, Frank Crosswaith emigrated from his native St. Croix during his teenage years, landing himself in the heart of Harlem just as the local labor movements began to rise in prominence. Joining a local elevator operators’ union and later graduating from high school, Crosswaith won a scholarship from a Socialist newspaper - the Jewish Daily Forward - which would land him at the prestigious Rand School of Social Science where he would study and be further embedded into the local Socialist movement through the SPA. After graduating, Crosswaith rose alongside other major New York-based Socialists such as A. Philip Randolph and Hubert Harrison while developing his own form of non-discriminatory De Leonist-inspired Socialism, rising to lead multiple different unions and even running a close but ultimately failed race for Secretary of State of New York before forming his own Negro Labor Committee in 1935. Now, with the radical Leftist forces of NYC rallied behind him, this raceblind De Leonist, nicknamed by his allies as ‘the Negro Debs’ after his contemporary Eugene V. Debs, aims to bring true racial equality, equitable freedom, and democratic American-formed Syndicalism to the Big Apple."
POLITICS_MCWILLIAMS_DESC:0 "Face of the Christian Front’s Protestant Wing, Joe McWilliams is a homegrown American far-right radical and firebrand. Born in 1904 to a poor pioneer family in Oklahoma, McWilliams has traveled around the nation before finally setting up shop in Manhattan. Riding around in his American-flag draped Conestoga wagon, McWilliams first made a name for himself as a vitriolic public speaker who would give speeches damning Communists, Capitalists, and the Jewish people to Hell due to their apparent role in ruining the world. Now, after failing to win a seat in government in the past, McWilliams joined up with the Christian Front, where he leads his own radicalized faction called the Christian Mobilizers atop his own political platform called the American Destiny Party. Along with his long-time political ally, the Anthropologist and Racial Eugenicist Madison Grant, McWilliams and his Christian Mobilizers shall bring piety, pride, and pure Americanism to this City that Never Sins, no matter the cost."
POLITICS_MOLLOY_DESC:0 "Standing as the unity figure within the Christian Front, Bishop Thomas Edmund Molloy is respected by nearly all within our coalition. Born in 1884, Molloy was a New Hampshire native before coming to New York after finishing his college studies in Theology abroad in Rome. Dedicated to the Catholic Church but still friendly to his Protestant allies, Molloy was raised as the unity candidate of the CF due to his knowledge and proximity with the clergy, his wide-reaching network of Christian allies both within the City and abroad, and for his widely shared ideas of Anti-Socialism and Anti-Semitism - both hallmarks of Christian Front doctrine. Though there are rumors that Bishop Molloy may still hold bias towards his Irish Catholic brethren, on the surface he is the picture of unity, and under his guidance as graced by God, we shall make this Big Apple into a new Heaven on Earth."
POLITICS_GENEROSO_POPE_DESC:0 "One of the most prominent and outspoken Italian-Americans in the Big Apple, Generoso Pope has risen to lead the Christian Front in a move that has shocked many. Though behind closed doors Pope isn’t the most pious or dedicated man of God, when in public with his CF allies, he is the picture-perfect example of a pious Italian-American Catholic. Born in 1891 in Taly and moving to America as a boy, Pope has risen to be a business magnate, influential public figure, advocate for Italian-American rights, and the biggest proponent of Italian-brand Legionarism in the City. Chiefly inspired by the likes of D’Annunzio and Italo Balbo, Pope seeks to use the CF as a vehicle to bring a nationalist system to New York modeled on the Italian ANI. With an ever-growing legion of loyal New York Catholics at his back, perhaps he will be able to make this dream a reality as this ‘Duce of Little Italy’ consolidates power and the rest of the Big Apple in his hands."
POLITICS_EDWARD_DE_VALERA_DESC:0 "Éamon de Valera, or now more commonly known by his American name Edward, was born in New York to a Spanish father and Irish mother and was later taken to Ireland at the age of two. Later as a commander in the Easter Rising and a political leader during the War of Independence, de Valera proved his skill and heroism, but tragically ended up slipping into political irrelevancy due to some poor political moves and misfortune following the Anglo-Irish treaty. After garnering more hate due to his rivalry with Michael Collins and following the rise of rival radical elements on the Emerald Isle, de Valera was forced into political exile, and as a result, he took a boat back to the shores of his original homeland. Now back in New York, de Valera fell in with the influential elitists at Tammany Hall, and by further using new ties to the Irish Catholic-dominated Christian Front and Irish Mob, he has been able to rise to prominence with the municipal government, cementing himself atop a new political throne safe from his former enemies in Dublin. Still a devoted Irish Nationalist, Gaelic Revilivalist, and Traditionalist Catholic with a love for Fiscal Conservatism and Right-wing Capitalism, de Valera shall now put his expertise to work here in the Big Apple, for our fine city always gives those in need a second chance, if they have the skills and the guts to grab it."

### Ideas ###
NYC_tammany_hall:0 "Tammany Hall’s Corrosive Influence"
NYC_tammany_hall_desc:0 "Like a plague upon our democracy, the massive political machine that is Tammany Hall has seen better days, but it is still well-funded and influential despite being widely despised. We must take measures, one way or another, to deal with their influence lest we fall victim to their shadowy ambitions."

NYC_the_mafia:0 "Organized Crime Problem"
NYC_the_mafia_desc:0 "All across NYC, the cancer that is organized crime rots away the core of our Big Apple. From the Commission of Luciano and Lansky to Murder, Inc. or the Harlem gambling kingpins, all of the Five Boroughs and beyond are infected with this plague. These groups of immigrants and immigrant families - usually Italian, Jewish, Irish, or Black - must be stopped so that their criminal and sinful ways no longer plague our fine city."
NYC_the_mafia3:0 "Crime Problem"
NYC_the_mafia3_desc:0 "New York is still infected by criminality, but moderate and less organized or professional acts have become the norm as organized crime slowly begins to wither and die. Though NYC is still far from crime free, at least gang wars do not rage across the streets."

NYC_economic_devestation:0 "A Burning Big Apple"
NYC_economic_devestation_desc:0 "New York City is still reeling from the Second American Civil War, with widespread damage to vital industrial areas and key centers for our military and economy such as the Brooklyn Shipyards, Broadway, Wall Street, Fort Hamilton, the NYPD headquarters, and more. We must endeavor and work hard to slowly undo the damage that has consumed New York so that the City that Never Sleeps may finally stir once more."

NYC_nypd:0 "The Might of the NYPD"
NYC_nypd_desc:0 "The largest and most well-supplied police force in American history, the New York Police Department is larger and better armed than many nations' own armed forces. Practically an army in their own right, and with the National Guard and SWAT teams at their flanks, the NYPD shall protect and serve like no other department in the world. By baton and gun barrel, law and order, nothing but truth and justice shall prevail as they build a better nation under their ever-vigilant gaze."

NYC_Mafia_Auxillary:0 "Mafia Military Support"
NYC_Mafia_Auxillary_desc:0 "The City Council has agreed to go ahead with an adaption of Operation Underworld, giving amnesty to certain members of organized crime groups in exchange for aid in defending military installations as well as serving as auxiliaries to our frontline infantry. Their manpower, cunning, and experience shall prove invaluable. Now if only they weren’t so stubborn and hard to train."
NYC_city_never_sleeps_never_falls_idea:0 "The City that Never Sleeps, and Never Falls"
NYC_city_never_sleeps_never_falls_idea_desc:0 "The City that Never Sleeps, and Never Falls - a new motto for the fortress that New York City has become. With new seawalls, fortification, barriers, security checkpoints, National Guard patrols, and other defenses than ever before, we have covered the Big Apple in a new skin of iron and steel. None shall pass and none shall penetrate our ironclad exterior, for the City that Never Sleeps shall never fall so long as at least one New Yorker still draws breath."

NYC_mafia_rule:0 "New York City Under the Commission"
NYC_mafia_rule_desc:0 "Under the Commission - a loose coalition of various criminal syndicates and outfits led by a council of bosses dominated by Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and Bugsy Siegel - New York City has been transformed into a true criminal state. The hierarchy of the Cosa Nostra has been integrated into the municipal government, with the face of the Commission serving as Mayor of our beloved Big Apple. On a foundation of crime and corruption that shall influence all aspects of the state, a new New York will be born under the shadowy sun of organized crime."

NYC_booze_sales:0 "Profit from Alcohol Sales"
NYC_booze_sales_desc:0 "With the failure of the Reform Party’s prohibition bill, New York’s alcohol industry - both legal and illegal - has breathed a sigh of relief. As a result, we are experiencing a small boon to our economy driven on the backs of increased liquor sales. Perhaps it was best that the bill failed."
NYC_prohib_outrage:0 "Resistance to Prohibition"
NYC_prohib_outrage_desc:0 "Despite Mayor Trump’s best intentions, his prohibition bill has proven to be a disaster, with bootlegging and speakeasies gaining prominence across the City once again. With crime and unrest skyrocketing, support for the Reform Party has plummeted, and it will be some time before the Big Apple adjusts to being a dry town."
NYC_withdrall:0 "The Pains of Withdrawal"
NYC_withdrall_desc:0 "The pains of withdrawal experienced by our city as it gets used to Prohibition have continued to persist, but slowly they have begun to lessen. As the NYPD gets a hand on the chaos and the spike in crime, most people are slowly beginning to get used to this new dry reality. Though we are still far from over our societal alcohol addiction, we are getting there."
NYC_prohib_good:0 "Success of Prohibition"
NYC_prohib_good_desc:0 "Finally, after what has felt like an eternity of chaos and struggle, the Big Apple has finally gotten used to the reality of Prohibition. The people have moved on to other fads, pastimes, and self-medications while criminal organizations have largely turned to other, less heavily policed avenues for profit. Though the odd bootlegger or speakeasy is still caught, it is a rare occurrence, and our economy has shown better life signs than it has in decades. Finally, the Reform Party is vindicated, for Prohibition has worked."

NYC_mad_long_island_desc:0 "Pushing back against the agenda of our administration, decrying it as pseudosyndicalism and corrosive liberalism, the various elite families and conservative farm owners across Long Island have protested against our recent actions fervently. Though this rage will likely die down with time, for now, Long Island from Amityville to Montauk is a bubbling cauldron of riots, unrest, protests, and general chaos. With most of our food grown there as well as a large portion of our most affluent citizens, our economy shall surely feel their rage."

With this move, the American Mafia, along with Murder, Inc. and many other similar organizations have been destroyed, leaving the City open to St. Clair’s ambitions."

NYC_free_market_mob_desc:0 "Rising from numbers rackets and small-time hustles to becoming the gambling lords of New York, our operations have brought profit, prosperity, and order to this fine city all on the back of criminal capitalism. With our mob the 40 Thieves focusing entirely on legitimate enterprise, capitalist growth, and mobster entrepreneurialism. With an economy and a society built entirely around shady business and organized corporate crime as we operate the largest gambling empire in the world, New York City is slowly transforming into a free market capitalist haven where the only law is St. Clair’s word."

NYC_back_to_the_people_desc:0 "It is our syndicate’s duty to care for the people of this city as we fill in the position of the previous government, or at least that is the view of Casper Holstein.

NYC_corrupted_no_more_desc:0 "In order to ensure the NYPD’s loyalty, Madame St. Clair has taken steps to eradicate all sources of corruption within the force aside from her own hooks within them.

NYC_Garvey_Influence:0 "UNIA Influence"
NYC_Garvey_Influence_desc:0 "Despite his criminal activities, Casper Holstein has never faltered from his dedication to Garveyite principles on Negro Nationalism. Devoted to the theories of Marcus Garvey, Holstein has moved to incorporate many of them here in the City, creating a new pro-Black independent Social Nationalist state in the Americas - one that cares for all of its citizens with Mobster Populism while paying special attention to its Negro population."

NYC_Gambling_New_York_desc:0 "Under the control of the Harlem kingpins, New York City has been transformed into the greatest gambling haven the world has ever seen, all atop the backs of our outfits and hard work. As the dice fly and the cards fall, our profit only continues to skyrocket, and with it so too does our prosperity and the quality of life of our citizens.

NYC_intellectual_socialism_idea_desc:0 "A modern day Renaissance Man and self-taught  polymath with deep ties to the Freethought Movement and other philosophical waves, Hubert Harrison has been hailed as the Black Socrates of Harlem, and for good reason. Advocating agnostic atheism, secular humanism, social progressivism, anti-supremacist and open ethno-nationalism, empirical observation, and rational reasoning in all things, Harrison preaches a fusion of modern ideas, time-honored wisdoms, and egalitarian cultural fusion and revivalism that is perfectly molded to the diverse reality of the Big Apple. Meticulously formulated over his multi-decade long career and form-fit for New York’s realities, let scientific, cosmopolitan metropolitan Socialist egalitarianism reign supreme and guide us towards utopia."

NYC_father_of_harlem_radicalism_idea_desc:0 "Hubert Harrison has long been dubbed the Father of Harlem Radicalism, especially since his leading role during the Harlem Renaissance, as well as after his longtime ally and friend Asa Philip Randolph headed South to the Black Belt. An intellectual, an agnostic atheist, a philosopher, and a Georgist with a genius-level intellect, Harrison has been at the forefront of the Harlem labor movement since emigrating from St. Croix, and now shall bring his brand of open, non-discriminatory racial nationalism to New York atop a foundation of egalitarian Socialist democracy and Georgist economics."

As such, he has begun to promote a program across all of New York that is aimed at reducing nationalist and racialist or racist tendencies in all forms. Crosswaith shall prove to the masses of the Big Apple that race truly does not matter."

NYC_de_leonism_idea:0 "A De Leonist Economy"
NYC_de_leonism_idea_desc:0 "Inspired by De Leonist principles, our economy is organized around trade unions that give great privileges and powers to the Proletariat while increasing our industrial efficiency, although they hold no explicit political power like they do in European-derived Syndicalism, for that still lies within the official party structure. This American-bred form of Syndicalism shall form the basis of our economics as we build an industrial economy that is more fair and more efficient than any European system!"

NYC_atheism_desc:0 "As our nation proceeds to finally eradicate the influence of colonialist Christian theology and other forms of organized religion, it seems our hope of people embracing Agnostic Atheism along with us has been misjudged. For many citizens within the City, organized religion served as a good way to deal with the oppressive plight that they faced every day. Not only that, but churches were a key part in the social lives of our people of all races, being an easy place to go and get guidance and meet people. However, we have evolved past these needs, and now our people must too. While we hoped that we could break the moral crutches called Religion and Faith, the rage against our choice seems to have proven otherwise. Already, voices within oppositional groups and further across the public have begun to cry out against our sudden shift, but they must soldier on, for we truly know what is best for all."

NYC_atheism_embraced:0 "Atheism Embraced"
NYC_atheism_embraced_desc:0 "It is said that time heals all wounds, and once again this has been proven here in the Big Apple. While our initial push towards Agnostic Atheism was met with quite the turbulent response, it seems that people have finally begun to adapt to the new status quo. As churches and synagogues close across the City to be converted into community centers and the like to meet the social needs of the masses, our newly enlightened populace flocks towards these new centers in order to fulfill the same social functions the Church did. Though there are rumors that some of these centers still practice religion, that is not a large issue, for the wide majority of the City has begun to see the true light. It is not our place to question whether there is a God or not, for we have great labors and problems here on Earth in our society that need fixing. Now, let us work together to build a secular Heaven on Earth."

All across our metropolis, criminals and corrupt scavengers pick away at our fine city as our government puts out larger and more pressing fires across the city. We must reprioritize what issues need to be faced and when so that we can focus on the most immediate threats to our democracy - the corrupt Democrat political machine Tammany Hall and the various organized crime outfits rallied around the Commission.

New York, or as it is more commonly known as New York City to differentiate it from the state it has now seceded from, now drifts towards its new destiny alone and untethered. Maneuvering between Syndicalist and Federalist forces, NYC has skinned by and now stands as an independent city-state on the brink of internal collapse. With gangs and looters rioting in the streets as Leftist cells fight local National Guard regiments, the crumbling coalition that is the Fusion Party of incumbent mayor Fiorello La Guardia now must attempt to steer this rickety ship towards safe harbor, lest the whole city sink beneath the waves of radicalism and chaos."

Street cleaning and garbage pick up are being organized and made efficient. The sewage system is being expanded and modernized. NYPD anti-corruption measures are being expanded as new recruits are hired and trained en masse to better combat the organized crime problem. Anti-racist and pro-equal rights programs have been spread as La Guardia champions the African American cause. Internal affairs divisions are even being created across the government and its offices, providing accountability and an inside man into every branch of the metropolitan system, ensuring there is a system of checks and balances on every department in the City.

Though this Fusion ticket has fractured and shrunk, La Guardia still enjoys the respect and support of many elements that were once part of his coalition as well as other like-minded representatives from across NYC’s political scene. With this in mind, it should be no issue for the La Guardia administration to drum up support and camaraderie between like-minded parties and groups within the stabilized political stage of the City.

Famed for his career as an entertainer, many now hope his mastery of the dramatic world can now translate to skill in the political world.

Far more progressive and Leftist than the initial plan set by La Guardia and Roosevelt years ago, this ‘Newer Deal’ as it has been nicknamed is set to bring about a peaceful, moderate ‘reformation revolution’ within the Big Apple. Taking the ‘3 R’s’ of the New Deal - relief for the poor, recovery of the economy, and reform to ensure it never happens again - and taking them in a more radical and far-sweeping direction, this ‘Newer Deal’ will metamorphosize NYC into a true, pink welfare state that takes the good of both Liberalism and Socialism without falling to radicalism or extremist principles."

This shall function both as a grand test for his newly privatized NYC, as well as the first step towards his plan of totally modernizing and privatizing every aspect of the City that Never Sleeps. With this plan, new sewers, subways, parkways, highways, bus routes, ferry lines, telecommunications networks, and more shall be refitted, modernized, and expanded, all using private funds and private workforces."

NYC_prosperous_city_desc:0 "Flying in the face of his doubters and detractors, Mayor Fred Trump has ushered in a new golden age of profit and prosperity for New York City and its people. Our shining Big Apple has become gilded and glittered with gold like never before as this financial renaissance breathes new life into our once-shaken metropolis. Financial ruin, bankruptcy, and the allegations of bad business are but a thing of the past now, for Mayor Trump has proven to all that his way is the right way to make New York great like never before!"

All across America, violence and chaos reign supreme, and the same shall soon be true for the rest of the world as the global hegemons steer towards war. However, such a chaotic reality only breeds new opportunities for our metropolis, and as such, Mayor Trump has a plan. We shall tap into the hellish and bloody industry that is war so that we may profit while others squander and bicker like fools. Atop the ashes of the old world order, we shall build a prosperous and golden financial empire like the one which the world has never seen, for there is only one truth - War is a Racket!"

NYC_encourage_charity_desc:0 "We could be the richest beings in the world, but that would not change the reality that there are those that are less fortunate that we, for not all can be the financial geniuses that we are. In order to fulfill our Christian duty while also earning some tax breaks and a ticket into Heaven along the way, Mayor Trump has encouraged and incentivized charitable acts like never before. All those within the state who make over a certain amount will be forced by law to give a small percentage to charity, in lieu of the taxes and other payments they’d have to make to the state in other, lesser systems. Our economy is already supported by their business, and now our poor and downtrodden shall be supported by their excess, all for the good of the City and our souls."

NYC_police_state_desc:0 "Orders - that is all we were given by the government when they told us to protect the common citizenry of our city from petty thugs, thieves, radicals, extremists, opportunists, scavengers, and the Mob itself. Yet, everytime we were close to catching an important figure or sticking it to a dangerous crime outfit, we would get shafted. Our intelligence would be wrong. The courts would fail us. The very bureaucracy that gave us our orders would fail to step in and defend us when things went wrong, letting criminals go and good men die all to save their own asses. ‘No longer!’ our officers say, for it is finally time to take control of our Big Apple ourselves, as we know we are the only ones who can save it from itself. Law and order shall reign once again, no matter the cost."
NYC_purge:0 "Root Out the Mob"
NYC_purge_desc:0 "The vile tentacles of the Mob and organized crime within the City are in everything. Brewing operations, extortion rackets, bootlegging, underground gambling, and even beginnings of things so vile as human trafficking and drug trading - all run by the Mafia in part or in full, pumping toxic sludge and thoughts throughout our fine streets without end - this has gone on long enough. This hedonistic degeneracy that has been allowed to infest our streets has persisted for too long, and now with our new and unshackled position of power, we shall wage open war against these louts, eradicating them once and for all."
NYC_ensure_police_funding:0 "Fund the Boys in Blue"
NYC_ensure_police_funding_desc:0 "Tammany Hall and the other corrosive forces that once ran our city had starved our fine servicemen, throwing their paychecks into their own growing coffers or towards bribes used to corrupt more of our weak-willed brethren. Even those politicians who were not corrupt and who opposed that den of foxes ended up throwing our bonuses into such useless sectors as theatrics and public housing projects. It is about time we took our rightful dues from the very city we protect, for policing is hard, dangerous work, and we must be adequately compensated for such a heroic and herculean effort."

The corrupt and the criminal shall be brought to justice once and for all, and law and order shall reign supreme in the Big Apple!"
NYC_embrace_corruption:0 "Embrace Corruption"
NYC_embrace_corruption_desc:0 "The streets of New York are at peace for the first time since the Great Crime Wave, and it is all thanks to our new direction. Not through conflict and violence, but through cooperation and coexistence have we achieved this peace. Opting to embrace corruption for the greater good of the City, the NYPD shall secretly tie itself to reasonable and diplomatic crime groups like the Commission, getting a cut of the action in exchange for turning a blind eye towards their less egregious operations. Our officers shall now demand a pretty penny in exchange for allowing those shadowy organizations in alleyways, seedy clubs, and other places to keep their operations running, all in the name of a peaceful - and profitable - co-existence."

NYC_tough_on_crime_desc:0 "The great boroughs of this proud yet extensive city are an impossibly dense and large place. Patrolling is immensely difficult in such a sprawling and vast metropolis, and so criminals flood the underpasses, alleys, and other dark underbellies of the city with ease. Let us make it apparent to all that those criminals we catch will be given harsh punishments for their crimes against the stability of the city and the safety of the Department. We shall leave no stone unturned and no dark corner unpatrolled, for crime cannot hide from our boys in blue - only law, order, and justice shall rule this city."

NYC_shoot_looters_desc:0 "The civil war had caused Brooklyn and the Bronx to collapse into riots and protests as Socialists waged war with our forces and other independent groups in the streets while Queens and the underground of the other burroughs further slipped into the grasp of the Mob. Although it has quieted down since then largely thanks to our efforts, the judge who called the shots before our rise had let all those looters and brigands off with but a mere slap on the wrist, leaving them open to commit the same crime the very next day. Those looters that have been caught by our Department deserve a quite simple and effective charge for their crimes. A bullet to the back of the head. A few executions will shape up this city’s ethos, hopefully rendering this punishment unnecessary as people come to their senses and learn their lessons."

NYC_police_militarization_desc:0 "How can our Department hope to keep up with the arms race waged by criminal groups, especially in an environment where firearm acquisition is easier than ever with a civil war waging across our borders. Guns smuggled into the harbor have turned simple raids into sieges and petty thugs now pack arms meant for soldiers on the frontlines. Let us counter those thugs with an ever superior budget, for their own dens shall now be patrolled and raided by armored vehicles, heavy weapons, assault squads, and even the naval and air power of the Department’s finest."

No secret hideout or meeting place shall be safe from the ever-vigilant NYPD."
NYC_curfew:0 "Institute a City-Wide Curfew"
NYC_curfew_desc:0 "Good and well meaning citizens of this city should be in bed with full stomachs and prayers finished by 10pm at night without needing to be told to, so there is no further reasoning for why we do not need to institute a curfew throughout our city. Those that stay out past that time are already suspect and likely in the hold of a gang or crime syndicate, thus their just and warranted arrests shall be swift and just."
NYC_crush_syndies:0 "Crush Syndicalist Sympathizers in the Force"
NYC_crush_syndies_desc:0 "Our Department shall never forget those volatile beginning days of the civil war, when city hall was besieged by Socialists and our many businesses and parks were looted and ravaged, with shop owners forced onto their roofs with meager firearms in a noble but dangerous display of self-defense. Thus to prevent anarchy from spreading into the City once more, we must kick out those in the Department with Socialist leanings or sympathies, for they are the most likely to open our castle gates to those dark forces again."
NYC_stay_in_line:0 "Stay in Line!"
NYC_stay_in_line_desc:0 "When you pass an officer of the NYPD, give him a smile and a good tip of the hat. When you drive make sure to be orderly and watchful of the lights. There are many sly dissidents within the population that think they can get away with demonstrations and hunger strikes against our hold on the public order, and they are sorely wrong in that thought process. For dissidence is the first step towards disorder and anarchy. With these tips in mind, law and order shall reign in our fine City in perpetuity, and if you stray, well the NYPD is always right around the corner ready to change your attitude or more."

Now, with the City in the palm of our hands, it is finally time to reclaim the legacy and status robbed from the Democratic Party and the Society of St. Tammany. The City that Never Sleeps belongs to Tammany Hall now, and we shall do with it as we please."
NYC_pro_irish_politics:0 "Pro-Irish Politics"
NYC_pro_irish_politics_desc:0 "The foundation of our support base is the City’s vast population of conservative, Catholic Irish-American. With most of our support coming from this population, as well as with most of our prominent members being Irish Catholics themselves, it is a no-brainer that we should tailor our legislation to cater to this important and influential group and their preferences for Catholic-orientated, conservative capitalist policies."

NYC_work_with_WASPs_desc:0 "With Trump’s defeat, much of the WASP - or White Anglo-Saxon Protestant - support he once enjoyed have now begun to flee back into our arms. With this influx of WASPs, we should take their needs into account as we begin to consolidate our hold on the City. Despite religious differences and ethnic history between these WASPs and our Irish majority, the conservative desires of these two groups align quite well, and as such they should have no issues working together if they can be shown that it is for the common good of our shared interests."

With this in mind, we have moved to not restore the democratic system - even in a facade-form. Instead, we shall make it known that Tammany Hall, and we alone, rule this city now. The only votes held in the Big Apple will now only be between members of our own Society, and the secretive Bosses shall have the final say in all matters. Democracy and Republicanism are well and truly dead, for a new form of government - a better form - shall rise in its place under our guidance and control."

The Society of St. Tammany, in all its benevolent glory, shall recreate the democratic system, with the New York Senate being restored to order. However, all political offices shall be dominated by the influence of Tammany Hall.

As such, the structure and hierarchy of the Society of St. Tammany shall be integrated into the administration of the City itself.

NYC_corrupt_politics_desc:0 "Corruption is like an art - it takes a steady hand guided by a master to get the most out of it without getting caught or angering the wrong person. This art has been perfected by the Bosses of Tammany Hall over decades, and now rises to become not just an art, but legislated politics within our fine city. New York City shall be built upon corruption, graft, and other financial sin all authorized by Tammany Hall’s newest laws, with everything from our politics and economics to social culture revolving around criminal pursuits of prosperity. We do corruption like none other, and now we shall show the world just how well we have perfected our craft."
NYC_capitalist_elitism:0 "Institutionalized Social Elitism"

It was the elites that built this city, and it is the elites that run it now, and it is the duty of Tammany Hall to defend this reality. Conservative elitism shall be institutionalized, becoming the fabric and lifeblood of our new culture and society. No longer shall the everyman be made out to be some tragic hero, for we know the truth - the bourgeois are the true heroes in the story of our city."

No longer shall the NYPD merely turn a blind eye to our activities, for they shall now be physically complicit in these ‘crimes’ - though what is a crime when you dictate the law? With the police at our beck and call, liable to do anything and everything we say, the Big Apple now lives in chains of our own making, ready to do whatever we need it to in order to further our own ambitions."

To clean up our public image in the eye’s of the public masses, the young firebrand Carmine DeSapio and his partner J. Raymond Jones shall head a campaign aimed at transforming the image and reputation of the Society of St. Tammany into a rose-tinted and flattering facade. Though the young DeSapio will have a mountain of work before him, we have faith that he and his team will be able to work wonders, giving us control over the opinions and minds of the masses."

The drug trade, fueled by suppliers in South America, Asia, and Africa, has seen a boom in recent years like none would have expected - it is finally time to introduce ourselves to these markets so that we can stay ahead of the curve and possibly corner the entire drug market before competition arises."

Coming to New York after being forced from Capone’s Chicago Outfit, Luciano began to mend the divides that had plagued these groups for so long while also coming to head the Luciano crime family himself. Now, with his efforts nearly paying off in full, it is finally time to call a summit between the five largest groups, or ‘families’ so as to keep the peace.

Prioritizing traditional mobster capitalism and the evolution of their activities towards legitimate and legal operations, such as legalized gambling and gun running, Lansky seeks to legitimize the Commission and his National Crime Syndicate into a profitable and prosperous venture that incorporates the ideas of all his allies as he works to make a made-man out of every New Yorker."

Additionally, the right to vote must not be tied to union membership, for no adult citizen should be denied the right to vote, no matter their position or union standing. We will build a fair, free, and direct democracy here in NYC, where citizens vote directly on referendums while new laws and the apparatus of state are handled by mass-appointed representatives and civil servants that can be recalled at a moment’s notice.

Groups such as the local Hebrew and Socialist masses have long been hated by many within our group, while Negroes are a more contentious topic with half of the Front being for their inclusion in our utopia so long as they are pious while the half led by McWilliams sees them as abhuman.

newyork_prewar.1.d:0 "As our mighty and righteous Worker’s Government prepares for the Second Revolutionary War that shall surely follow the end of MacArthur’s foolish deadline, it seems that just as many within our own ranks cannot wait for the coming conflict, this same hunger for war as spread to MacArthur’s Federalist lackies. All throughout New York City and the Jersey coastline, Federalist forces have launched a preemptive attack against our forces in hopes of reclaiming the Big Apple. Made up mostly of loyalist sailors stationed within the city itself, the overall goal of the attack is seemingly to rob us of arguably the second most important city next to Chicago in the Revolutionary struggle. While our forces are and indeed have been entrenched in New York since well before the 1936 election, the Federalists are not without aid in their attempts to rob us of New York, as many locals are aiding them against the ‘Socialist menace.’ Despite this aid, the battle is still raging, and victory could fall to either side"

newyork_prewar.2.d:0 "Massacre. Bloodbath. These words seem insufficient to describe the events that took place in the aftermath of the Battle of New York City stalling. Just how many men died on either side is still unknown. French journalist Gabriel Péri who had just arrived from the Commune along with a myriad of others, described vivid scenes from the battle, including how on entire streets, whole squads would be mowed down in a matter of seconds by either side. Mass deserations on both sides have been reported, and it seems that In the wake of this disaster, Federalist units have begun quitely abandoning the City, leaving for more friendly shores. However, our own units have also begun pulling back out of their own accord, officially due to us winning the battle. but according to some reports this is simply not the case.\n\nIf they are to be believed, the New York Police Department, local National Guard units,and allegedly even Mobsters have begun to clear out stragglers from both sides in the recently concluded battle. The reports go on to say that they are allegedly preparing to declare the City either a neutral zone or fully independence from the United States. Attempts to reach out to Fiorello La Guardia, Mayor of New York, have so far been met with not but vague assurances that the Mayor’s Office ‘has the situation under control.’ With this being the case, and with worries that the Federalists could still be waiting to take our largest sea port from us, members of the High Command, especially those with close links to the Centralist and Vanguardist factions, have called for us to do anything we can to ensure that New York City remains within our hands, even if that means forcefully marching down broadway to restore order. However others within the High Command suggest for us to simply let the city be. After All, our own men reported that we won the conflict. What point is there in not believing their word? Besides, war with the rest of the country is coming, and resources that are spent to defend New York are resources that aren’t being spent to spread the Revolution to our compatriots. Regardless of what we do next, we must act quick, lest the City fall into Federalist hands after so hard fought a battle."

Coming as something of surprise to the rest of the divided nation, La Guardia cited the recent violence of the Battle of New York along with a myriad of other reasons for the City’s exit from the Union. La Guardia, as his first act as Mayor one of the last remaining city-states on Earth, has called for snap elections, to be held at an unspecified time in the near future.\n\nWhile La Guardia’s decision may seem rushed and without popular sentiment, this is far from the case. For years, New York City has felt disconnected from the rest of America. Be it New York’s highly unique culture, differences in politics, economic prowess or the government repeatedly failing to deliver on promises of aid during the Depression, plenty exists to justify the Big Apple’s newfound freedom. The cherry on top, and by far the largest contributor to independence’s popular mandate, has been the Battle of New York. Nothing better exists to show that New York is valued not as a city but as a strategic resource then that bloodbath that was the Battle.\n\nRegardless, New York and it’s vast economic, industrial, and population resources are now lost to the Revolutionary cause, and due to the looming threat of the civil war, we have no choice but to let them be, for now."

NYC.0.t:0 "The ‘City that Never Sleeps’ Now Burns"
NYC.0.d:0 "Sitting at the end of the mighty Hudson like a wondrous pearl washed towards the sea, New York was once the largest city in the now-dying Union, and perhaps even the greatest metropolis on Earth. First settled by the Dutch in 1624, the once sleepy and unassuming coastal colony that was New Amsterdam would evolve overtime to turn into the bustling, ever-awake center of global economics and culture that it is today, doing the impossible to become the urban crown jewel of the old United States. However, the golden era that brought NYC to this breathtaking pinnacle has been abruptly cut short, and now the infamous Big Apple burns much like the rest of the dying Union. \n\nThe outbreak of the Second American Civil War spelled doom for the American nation and its people, with families and friends torn apart as political tensions sparked factionalism and violence. These divisions were seen across the faltering nation, from the Pacific Coast to the Deep South to even the outlying Unincorporated Territories and beyond. However, due to the close-quarters nature and sheer density of the Northeastern Metropolis, these tensions and acts of violence and political expression were far more cutthroat and intense here in the Big Apple than perhaps anywhere else in the nation. Being the most densely populated region in the nation while simultaneously standing as a melting pot of diverse cultures and viewpoints, New York City became a bloody microcosm of the wider Civil War. Given its location and key importance, the Syndicalist and Federalist factions both claimed the City as their own, with this being evident in the streets as separate borders and barricades rose in this new urban hell. Neighbor fought neighbor and brother slaughtered brother as the cosmopolitan nature of the metropolis turned against it. Socialist unions and militias from the City’s vast industrial sectors took up arms against the New York Police department as the various crime syndicates feasted on the chaos. The Brooklyn Shipyards and local naval bases devolved into infighting as Federalist and Syndicalist-aligned sailors turned on each other in order to secure the vast fleets dry-docked for repairs and refits. Wall Street devolved into bloodshed as Socialist made a run on the financial sector only to be met by the guns of the NYPD and Tammany Hall forces who had taken to the rooftops to defend their assets. Makeshift fortresses and blockades littered the streets and alleys, with Broadway turning into a No Man’s Land littered with shell craters and bodies only disturbed by the shudder of canons or the screams of scavengers and looters caught in the machine gun fire of a passing patrol or encamped hardpoint. The city that never slept was kept constantly awake by the blood-curdling horrors and cacophony of endless war, but somehow, the City held firm. \n\nWhat was once a glistening example of the American Dream is now a blood-soaked ruin, and at the center of it all is Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who has rallied the bulk of the City’s non-radicals under a temporary banner for peace and for the preservation of NYC. Elected in 1933, La Guardia was the first Italian mayor of the city and the first mayor in decades to be free from the corrupt Democrat political machine known as Tammany Hall. With the City now independent - having fended off the selfish desires of both Chicago and Washington, Mayor La Guardia has become the main executive of the city, and to many, its final protector. Standing in the middle of fighting Socialists, police officers, mobsters, Democrats, opportunists, Federalists, and more, few envy La Guardia’s position, but despite an upcoming emergency election, his determination to save his city has not wavered. Navigating the minefields, both political and literal, of his war-torn city, it is up to La Guardia to attempt to bring peace to this hellzone. However, with numerous forces circling ‘Little Flower’ as he is sometimes called, La Guardia must act fast lest he lose his position to more power-hungry forces."

The second new design replaces the State Seal once more, but with an arrangement of stars. With one 11-pointed star in the center representing New York’s position as the 11th State to join the Union, and with it surrounded by 13 smaller stars depicting the original Thirteen Colonies, this symbolic design is popular among patriots.

NYC.111.t:0 "The Political Stage of NYC"
NYC.111.d:0 "The political stage of NYC is as hectic and cutthroat as it is diverse, with political groups representing peoples of all backgrounds - both socioeconomic and ethnic. However, on this stage of stages that is the Big Apple, it takes far more than a snappy message and a boisterous voice to get far. In the City that Never Sleeps, the giants of metropolitan politics duke it out in a nonstop brawl to control America’s largest city. \n\nCurrently lording over the Big Apple as the 99th elected mayor in the city’s history is the beloved and divisive Fiorello H. La Guardia - the first Italian mayor in the city’s history. First winning his seat back in 1933, La Guardia has defended his position from the likes of Tammany and the Mob, but with the current chaotic situation America now faces, his troubles have evolved into far more gruesome foes. Running on his Fusion Party ticket to appease the disillusioned masses, this tactic may have worked a few years ago, but now with the political arena of the City fractured, his unity approach may not cut it. With he and his base of Republican devotees and other liberal supporters defending their democratic mandate, the wolves circle them without cessation. \n\nThe most well-established political enemy to Mayor La Guardia is his old rivals in Tammany Hall, but after recent scandals and a crushing loss to La Guardia in 33’ they have been severely weakened and disgraced. Officially called the Society of St. Tammany, Tammany Hall is a political machine devoted to the Democratic Party running on institutionalized graft and corruption, and with their recently ruined reputation, they will likely need to seek alternative avenues to power. However, Tammany Hall is far from his only opponent. Splitting off from his Fusion ticket, the radical Progressive Orson Welles seeks to rally laborist and progressive-minded Republicans as well as moderate Socialists in order to secure a Social Democratic New York. However, he is not alone in championing the Leftist cause, for his old friend and fellow celebrity John Steinbeck has risen to rally the true Left of NYC in order to usher in a moderate and peaceful Socialist revolution while backed by the Combined Syndicates of Chicago and the Third Internationale as well as the various Syndicalist and other radical Leftist cells throughout the City. Opposing them on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum is Fred Trump and his Reform Party. Aligned with the Old Democratic Party of the South, the Reform Party is a splinter group of Tammany Hall, with Fred Trump and his supporters abandoning a Democratic party they feel has lost its way to Catholic meddling and far too Liberal capitalism. Instead his free market approach seeks to bring prosperity to the City, despite allegations and rumors abound of his racial views and ties to the Ku Klux Klan and ODP leadership. Outside the main group of politicians and firebrands but still equally poised to seize the Big Apple for themselves are the two diametrically opposed and impossibly intertwined forces of the New York Police Department and the faceless, amorphous specter of organized crime. With Police Chief Lewis Valentine trying to keep the peace as he beats back radicals and mobsters alike, the Commission led by Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and Bugsy Siegel seek to take the City that Never Sleeps for themselves. With this wild stage set, and with emergency elections called for by the La Guardia administration now looming, New York City’s fate dangles in the air as the curtains come up and this chaotic show must go on"

NYC.1.t:0 "Snap Elections for the Mayor of NYC"
NYC.1.d:0 "With the Big Apple now free from warring Syndicalists and Federalists that nearly destroyed our metropolis, we too have become free of the only unifying force keeping Mayor La Guardia’s engorged Fusion Party ticket together. With the writing on the wall and with the City in desperate need of a resolved, or perhaps even new, direction, the La Guardia administration called for new snap elections - a first for the City. In the chaos that has surrounded the hasty organization of this new election, four men have risen to become prime contenders for the new title of Mayor of New York City. \n\nDefending his mandate and his administration stands Fiorello La Guardia, the incumbent Republican mayor touted by many as ‘the Man who saved New York.’ Despite setbacks and the near-complete collapse of his Fusion Party coalition, La Guardia is still in a strong position to win re-election, though it is far from as assured as it was just a few short months ago. Despite the chaos, he still seeks to institute the New Deal - a progressive socioeconomic plan partially developed years prior during his time working with the late Franklin Roosevelt - to boost and equalize the economy while safeguarding true American democracy within the City. His prime opponent vying for the same support base is Orson Welles and his Labor Party, largely seen as the ‘Good Syndicalist’ despite desperate attempts to distance himself from Syndicalism and Revolutionary Leftist ideas. Welles is running on a campaign of egalitarian social justice, progressive social democracy, and patronage of the vibrant New York cultural scene in a fair social capitalist system. Further to the Left of Welles, John Steinbeck has also thrown his hat in the ring. Having united the remaining Syndicalist and Socialiest cells within the City limits as well as those Leftists disillusioned by Welles’s moderate and compromised approach, Steinbeck seeks to bring about a peaceful Socialist reformation while dodging claims that he is a spy or agent of the CSA or the Third Internationale. These accusations however have not stopped his message of equality and economic redistribution from resonating with the city's extensive urban poor, giving him a strong chance to swipe the election from behind. Finally there is Fred Trump, a real estate magnate who has become the figurehead for big business and free-market capitalist interests within the Big Apple with his Reform Party - a splinter from Tammany Hall with ties to the Old Democratic Party down south. He wants to turn the City that Never Sleeps into a modern Venice where government and business go hand in hand to encourage the prosperity of the state. However his track record with dodging taxes and equality laws while funding and supporting the ODP and the KKK have made many wary of his promises, but they can do little to stop his powerful backers and the torrent of support he has from former Tammany supporters. \n\nWith these candidates all poised to lead the City at this turbulent and crucial crossroads, it is truly anyone’s race as the election draws near."

From Flatbush to Astoria, from Bed-Stuy to Riverdale, all of NYC is abuzz and aflame as looters, rioters, and other degenerate opportunists ransack our beloved city in what is being quickly known as ‘The Great Crime Wave of [GetYear].’ The city streets twinkle with the broken glass of storefront windows and run red with the blood of innocent and guilty alike as crime threatens to completely consume the City that Never Sleeps. Seeking to capitalize on the anarchy, the Commission headed by Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky along with Murder Inc. and the Five Families have taken this moment of weakness to make their move to corner more of the city.

The situation has grown dire and Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine has met with the Mayor personally to argue his case. Chief Valentine has demanded that the restrictions on the police be relaxed or abolished entirely, and that the police force be augmented by the NYC City Guards and the armories be opened immediately, so that the NYPD can properly defend the City from the radicals and criminals that besiege it. The Mayor is still hesitant to comply however, citing that such a move would only cause further panic, so it would seem that the political administration is now useless in this matter. However, history will happen without the permission of these fat-cat plutocrats or with it, and something must be done now - the only question is what.

All across the city, mob rule reigns supreme, with the Police Headquarters at Centre and Broome Streets being one of the last blocks still solidly in Police hands. The final nail in the old regime’s coffin was struck when mafioso forces marched onto City Hall and literally threw the Mayor out of office after slaughtering many of the lower officials inside, with one mayoral aid notably dying by gunshot through the eye-glasses while getting a massage. With the Police having washed their hands of the situation and the resident National Guard too busy keeping the Civil War on the other side of the border, the Commission now rules the Big Apple."

Mobsters and crime bosses have been gunned down and executed by the dozen and the Five Families have fractured under the pressure. Mob affiliates have begun to flee the city en masses, while others have thrown in with the NYPD seeking amnesty or even rewards, leaving only the most die hard mobsters remaining in the city. However they know their power is broken and will take decades to recover, if at all, for the age of terror these criminal have wrought is over. In celebration of his victory, Police Chief Valentine has held a victory parade through the streets of New York, with Broadway lit up in excitement for the first time in months. \n\nAll was not normal however, for the City now stood as a fundamentally changed setting. After the dust settled and as the trash from the parade was cleared from the street, Chief Valentine, in a shocking move that few had the chance or will to resist, announced the now-former Mayor had been arrested during the celebrations, stunning the city. Chief Valentine accused him of letting the city fall into anarchy, and as such has denounced him as being unfit for duty. In his stead, Lewis J.

NYC.4.d:0 "With literal Mob rule now secured over the City, the Commission has found itself in unfamiliar waters. It had operated for years in the shadows, trying its best to stay out of the limelight and its members out of jail or the grave. Now, however, it has placed itself as front and center as it possibly could, for the City that Never Sleeps now dances in the moonlight with criminals and crooks. With the faceless Commission dominating metropolitan affairs, the public has begged for a return to some form of normalcy, and keen on keeping power, the mobsters have hatched a plan. \n\nBefore the chaos that befalls us now consumed the city, just a few short years ago, the Five Families were divided as gang war ate away at the foundations of societal order. This came to a head in the Castellammarese War as the largest crime boss in the City at the time Don Salvator Maranzano tried to force the Five Families to name him the ‘Boss of Bosses’ - or ‘Capo di Tutti i Capi’, which ended with the murder of Maranzano and the rise of Luciano’s Commission. Since this crime war, no single soul has called the shots in the Big Apple’s criminal underground, but the people of the City expect a central figure to rally around. To alleviate this need and to move towards stability and some shred of true statehood, the Commission has decided to take this haughty term ‘Boss of Bosses’ in stride, and have announced that they will internally choose a new Capo di Tutti i Capi to be the public face of the City’s new shadow regime - a Mayor by any other name. With this decision now declared, the City and the Commission now prepare to raise one of their own up to be Mayor of NYC - a prospect no mobster ever thought possible before these troubling times."
NYC.4.a:0 "Gather the Godfathers!"

NYC.5.t:0 "The Commission Convenes to Choose a ‘Capo di Tutti i Capi’"
NYC.5.d:0 "Today, the leading members of the Commission - chiefly represented by Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky - as well as Murder Inc. and the heads of the Five Families all gathered in a discrete location - more out of habit than necessity - to decide which one of them would become the public face of the Mob’s rule over the City. Though this group had learned their lesson on pooling resources and power into one single Don when Maranzano had to be put down just a few years ago, the Commission had decided that a face must rise to serve as the public image of our shadowy brotherhood. Mockingly taking Maranzano’s preferred term of ‘Capo di Tutti i Capi’ or the Boss of All Bosses, the group seeks to grant this newly-reformed moniker to one among them that will be the facade that stands between the people of New York City and the operations of our criminal syndicate - a criminal Mayor in sheep’s clothing. \n\nNaturally, the leading figures and founders of the Commission were the candidates that had been nominated by their peers to ‘lead’ them. The first was Charles ‘Lucky’ Luciano - a transplant from the Chicago Outfit with deep ties to Capone; ties that were sundered when Capone desired all of Chicago for himself forcing Luciano to relocate to the Big Apple nearly a decade ago. Luciano is the ringmaster of the Commission and its dominant co-founder while also being one of if not the most powerful mobsters in New York City’s underworld. He is also widely known and widely feared, being popular among the poor masses and immigrants of this metropolis for his generosity to the poor and minor adherence to pseudo-Socialist, ‘Caponeist’ ideas. Second to Luciano is his right hand man and fellow co-founder of the Commission Meyer Lansky, who has grown fantastically rich off of his gambling empire. Also a co-founder of Murder Inc., Lanksy - known warmly as the Mob’s Accountant - is seen as the compromise candidate between the dreams of Lucky Luciano and the ambition of Bugsy Siegel, and Lansky supports the idea of ‘going legit’ in order to bring in more profit and less heat. Finally, Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel stands as the head honcho of the hitsquad-for-hire Murder Inc. with a legion of Italian and Jewish gangsters and thugs behind him. Siegel opposes this idea of a National Crime Syndicate that Lansky and Luciano espouse, and instead seeks to restore the position of the Mob to its roots. Siegel champions the creation of a true ‘Boss of Bosses’ to lead the gangs of New York into a new golden age of criminal enterprise unfettered by law and drenched in blood. With the cards on the table and with everyone all-in, it's time for the Capo di Tutti i Capi - and in turn, the new ‘mayor’ of New York, to be chosen once and for all."

NYC.500.t:0 "The Fate of Tammany Hall"
NYC.500.d:0 "With our power secured and with normalcy returning slowly to the City, the Mayor has decided the time is right to once again go after Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall, otherwise known as the Society of St Tammany, is infamous in New York for its corruptive and meddling ways, already having been disgraced during La Guardia’s first electoral win. Tammany Hall is a political machine, controlling Democratic votes and wielding tremendous amounts of influence in the City and beyond - particularly among Irish and Anglo citizens. Under the infamous Boss Tweed, its corruption became public and since then it has only gotten more and more revile, with rumors of their mob ties and other unscrupulous activities abound. Now, with our nation independent and secure, we must weed out this fountain of corruption. The NYPD is primed and ready to raid its offices and bring its leaders in. However, its power and influence runs deep, and its pockets deeper, so the risks of this blowing up in our face are potentially high. What will we do?"

His fight against corruption in the force has made him a favorable figure in many New Yorker’s minds, especially after his response to the Great Crime Wave that swept the City soon after our independence. Now, this hero of the City and paragon of justice heads home for the final time to live out his retirement with his beloved wife and children. In his place, Officer Arthur Wallander has been named as Police Commissioner in his stead. Now, it is up to Chief Wallander to fill the shoes of this titan of law and order."

NYC.7.t:0 "The Fate of Wall Street"
NYC.7.d:0 "Wall Street was the symbol of American prosperity before its fiery crash during the Depression. Before that fall, it was the financial hub of the world, and its rise dragged the rest of the world up with it; and as such, its fall also took the rest of the world with it. The Great Depression, the pre-Civil War instability, and our fight for freedom have done a number on Wall Street, with many of its buildings long closed or in ruin, and with the Stock Market laying mostly abandoned even now. However, with the situation in our nation finally stable, we have decided to take a firm policy towards ‘the Street’. Socialists within the city detest the notion of Wall Street and wish to see it burned. They decry it as the center jewel in the crown of capitalism and if we were to destroy it we could make a newer, more humane economy on its ashes. However, the rest of the City predictably has the opposite view. They point to the prosperity of the early 1900s and the titans of industry it created as proof that the Street must be saved. They argue that if we go about destroying the very foundations of American capitalism like the Stock Market then we could do irreparable harm to the economy. We must make a decision."

NYC.8.t:0 "New York City Calls for Aid"
NYC.8.d:0 "We have received a message from the Free City of New York asking for emergency aid. The City is almost entirely urbanized and as such is dependent on foreign aid to survive, for it cannot grow its own food and relies on imports and a laughably meager fishing industry to feed its over 7 million people. They plead with us to send them food in return for lucrative business opportunities. If we deny them, we could weaken a potential economic rival. However, the suffering wrought at our hands if we were to condemn one of the most populous cities in the world to starvation would be unbearable to many within our cabinet and certainly would be a bad look in the eyes of the masses. If we instead do send them aid, then we can increase our own influence within the City - a lucrative prize in one of the most profitable cities on Earth."

NYC.10.a:0 "The City that Never Sleeps begins to doze off..."

NYC.11.t:0 "Utilize the Mob?"
NYC.11.d:0 "Some within our government have come to us with a proposal that would have us utilize the Mob for our own ends. The proposal suggests a backroom alliance with Luciano and Lansky’s Commission and their associates in Murder Inc., who would make our enemies sleep with the fishes or simply disappear in return for a weakened police presence and averted eyes to their less-obvious criminal dealings - provided they of course continue to grease the wheels of justice and statecraft with ample bribes. This could be very beneficial to us as using them could do much to secure our rule. However, there are some things an upstanding government like ours can't be caught doing, like liquidating dangerous seditious elements within our borders through illegally hired hitmen for example, and this is definitely one of them so it would have to be discreet. Furthermore, many others within our government have argued that if we do this, then we are no better than the despots of old and new or the very mobsters and murderers we would be dealing with. They say that to ally with the Mob would also give them way too much power, perhaps even putting our grip on power in jeopardy. What shall we do?"

The Society of St. Tammany, by far the largest political machine in New York, has turned on us openly, launching a public smear campaign against the Mayor and his administration. Newsboys on street corners distribute pamphlets telling slanderous lies, flyers have shown up on telephone poles lampooning the government over the city's problems, and billboards in support of the Tammany Tiger have gone up across the city. All the while, Tammany politicians within the city have unleashed a full broadside against the Mayor’s office. Unless something is done to finally quell the Tiger, the current administration may not survive long."

In a somber announcement, Mayor [root.getleader] has announced he along with his entire cabinet are resigning from their positions, effective immediately. In their place, a special governing body of city legislators has risen to form an interim administration until a new Deputy Mayor can be internally chosen. It's no surprise to anybody that this ‘council’ is made up nearly entirely of Tammany Hall loyalists, and as such, these corrupt Democrats are now wholly in control of the Big Apple. No matter who they choose, it is certain that it will be a Tammany Tiger who comes out on top."

NYC.15.d:0 "With the interim government merely being an arm of Tammy Hall’s ambitions, it is now time for the Grand Sachem and the other Bosses of Tammany Hall to come to a decision on who is to lead the city. Before the Bosses are two prime candidates for the position, both with ample experience and political clout. The first candidate is George Washington Olvany, a conservative judge and former head of the Hall. Olvany had resigned after clearly false accusations of corruption relating to using his political influence to enrich his personal law firm. However, we know these accusations are baseless and have been justly stricken from the record. Olvany promises a traditionalist return to the prominence of Tammany Hall in NYC and wants to expand its influence across the rest of the USA. Opposing him is the infamous and divisive Jimmy ‘Beau James’ Walker. Walker was the last Tammany mayor of NYC, at least until now, and was forced to resign due to a corruption scandal like Olvany, but is back at it again with Tammany’s resurgence. Like Olvany as well, the charges against him have been cleared justly, and Walker walks as a free and lawful man once again thanks to Tammany Hall’s patronage. The people already know Walker, with his reputation as a sound Liberal champion being well-known, and while he did have some hiccups in the past it won't be hard to pave over them to restore his reputation. Additionally, as a former public figure his election would be a lot more palpable to the people. Barely of note as they stand little chance of winning as two minor candidates slowly trying to rise through Tammany’s ranks, being the first prominent Black member of the machine Adam Clayton Powell Jr - a Conservative Bishop turned Populist Democrat dedicated to free democracy - and Jersey-born Enoch ‘Nucky’ Johnson who uses his links to the Irish Mafia to fuel his own personal political machine growing inside the Tammany Tiger like a tumor. Though both hold designs of one day leading the Democratic Party and usurping Tammany altogether, for now they are stuck within the belly of the beast. Regardless of who is chosen, Tammany Hall and its Bosses shall truly be in control."

One of the founding fathers of a free Ireland and a skilled revolutionary general who served with the IRA, de Valera is not only a skilled politician, but a veteran military officer and notable academic as well.

Any major crime hover will land you in a one way ticket to a grave either by firing squad, haning, or through the use of Sing Sing Prison’s ‘Old Sparky‘ - an electric chair infamous for frying hundreds of deranged psychos - to quickly eliminate these parasites of the State."

This had the desired effect of a good halloween scare paying an homage to one of the modern era’s greatest authors, but Mayor Welles did not predict so many to listen in and for so many to take it so seriously - an issue only inflamed by his position of power as Mayor of NYC. The chaos has been widespread, but thankfully no one was killed, though a few were injured in stampedes to panic and friendly fire between people too paranoid to be armed, but there has been quite a bit of property damage across the City.

Forced to take up arms against their attackers, these peaceful proletarians became revolutionaries and patriots overnight - a new Minutemen in the dawn of the Second American Revolutionary War. Denying attempt after attempt for the loudmouth Constitutionalist Colonel and his Klan cronies to surrender and collaborate, the townspeople-turned-partisans bravely defended their town knowing most of them will likely die. \n\nThe book, while widely supported by Mayor Steinbeck’s millions of political constituents and literary fans, has also come under fire for its content. Conservatives, supporters of the ODP, and other detractors to Steinbeck have trashed the book as being damaging fantasy and a Leftist delusion. One of the most outspoken critics of the novel has been one of Steinbeck’s largest and most diametrically opposed political opponents Fred Trump, calling it Syndicalist propaganda, with Tammany Hall sharing similar sentiments. In contrast to this, both La Guardia and Orson Welles have applauded the book, though both remarked it could rile up revolutionary sentiment within the City.

This ‘Coconut Monk’ - born as Nguyễn Thành Nam in Vietnam - preaches his word, called Dao Dua or the Coconut Religion, to mostly deaf ears and has been largely suppressed by the Germans. However their numbers do appear throughout the ranks of the various Indochinese rebels that wage guerilla war against the Kaiser’s forces, and it was here where Ricketts and Steinbeck found the Coconut Monk. Though Ricketts had only found the religion to be interesting, Steinbeck has come to secretly practice the religion while openly being a devout Episcopalian. With only his closest confidants such as his wife aware of the truth, it has done nothing to impact his public image. However, it has helped him greatly in finding inspiration in his writing as well as in mustering the will needed to run the greatest city in America. \n\nThe religion itself is a mix of Protestant, Buddhist, and traditional Vietnamese religious concepts with a special fixation with coconuts. Members of the religion are encouraged to only consume coconut water and coconut flesh, but whether Steinbeck follows this tennent is unknown.

This would naturally be an expensive effort and many are decrying it as a stunt for attention, arguing that a solid wall would be absolutely hopeless at stopping a sustained artillery bombardment or armored advance, alongside the obvious question of who was going to pay for the effort. Trump has insisted however that the City’s budget can afford it, and that it would create a vast amount of jobs for the huddled masses.

Despite his efforts, rumors and slander run rampant through the ranks of his rivals and detractors about these benefactors of Mayor Trump, though he has time and time again preached that he was only involved with the Klan due to their staunch anti-Catholic stance - himself being a devout Protestant - and has since cut all ties with their organization.

A long-time New York State Senator and wise leader of Tammany Hall, he will be missed. Sullivan is now to be replaced as Grand Sachem by Michael J.

NYC.44.d:0 "James John Walker, born as William H. Walker in 1881 and usually called Beau James by all who know him, has risen to be elected as Mayor of New York City. Through corruption and tampering, Tammany Hall got him into office, and now this former lawyer shall serve as the perfect charismatic face of our shadow government. Mayor Walker is a longtime member of Tammany Hall and leads the liberal wing of the organization. He is a staunch defender of Civil Rights and egalitarianism, capitalist economics supervised by the government, limited welfare policies, the ending of Blue Laws, the legalization of boxing, and more while being an ardent opponent of racism within Tammany Hall and now within the City. With Beau James as the friendly face of our operations, nothing can possibly go wrong."

NYC.45.t:0 "A Profile on Mayor Olvany"
NYC.45.d:0 "Once a powerful judge and fiercely conservative Democrat within Tammany Hall, George Washington Olvany was born to a middle class Irish family in 1876 and has since risen to become the Mayor of New York City with the backing of his political brotherhood and allies within the NYPD. While a lawyer, he used his law firm to scam clients before sending them to the Board of Standards and Appeals, making millions off of bureaucratic fees and buying many officers of the NYPD into his pocket along the way. Though he bears the first President of the United States’ name, he is far from that noble forefather. However, Olvany is just the right guy to be the face of Tammany Hall as Mayor of NYC."

NYC.450.d:0 "Now settled as the new Mayor of New York, the Irish-expatriate Éamon de Valera has been able to begin his dream of reforging his old home city and the adopted home of his parents - for de Valera was born in New York to Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Potato Famine and British persecution and left for Ireland as a teenager before being forced into exile by the radical elements that have since seized the Emerald Isle. A noted advocate for Gaelic Revivalism and a devout Catholic, New York has begun to experience its own Irish Renaissance as traditionalist Celtic Catholicism and its ideas, both politically and spiritually, begin to spread further across the Boroughs and beyond while the Gaelic language and wider conservative Irish culture slowly rises to become the dominant identity of the City. Furthermore, his economic reforms based around ideas of Rightist Capitalism and Fiscal Conservatism have begun to cause an economic boom throughout the City and her outer territories, creating a new wave of prosperity across our fledgling nation. However, Mayor Valera - or Mayor Edward or Mayor Eddy as he has been increasingly called by the masses despite his instance to call him by his ‘true’ Gaelic name - has been allegedly seen working with controversial fringe groups such as the slowly-centralizing Irish Mob under Bill Dwyer and the now Irish Catholic-dominated Christian Front, even being accused of personally holding anti-Semitic ideas himself, but these baseless accusations have not been proven in any court of law, as seen to by the Tammany Bosses backing de Valera’s political administration and future campaigns. Overall, Mayor ‘Edward’ de Valera may have some controversial rumors circulating about him, and though he clearly heavily favors the Irish Catholics of our nation, he has proven to be a sound and effective mayor if nothing else."

NYC.46.d:0 "Arthur Simon Flegenheimer - more commonly known as Dutch Schultz - and fellow snitch Joseph Michael Valachi, as well as other threats to our syndicates’ security, must be eradicated in order to preserve the stability of the Commission and its outfits. As such, in a similar vein to the purge against ‘Mustache Petes’ - or Sicilian Mobsters hostile to non-Sicilians trying to make it in the crime world before Luciano eliminated them all during and after the Castellammarese War - the Commission has reached a rare agreement to order the murder of these devisive elements. With Valachi squealing to the NYPD, revealing our existence before our rise, and with Dutch Schultz being investigated and even threatening the life of Prosecutor Dewey, we have no other choice but to clean house. All leaks shall be plugged, and all rumors shall be quashed. These rats will get what all vermin deserve, no matter how much blood must be spilled. Ready the cleaners, for soon the streets shall run red with the blood of traitors and turncoats."

NYC.47.t:0 "Going Up The River to Sing Sing"
NYC.47.d:0 "Just 30 miles North of New York City proper in the quiet town of Ossining, there exists a modern Hell on Earth known as the Sing Sing Correctional Facility. ‘Sing Sing’ as it is often called, is New York’s premier supermax prison, and many of our good associates, friends, and family have been ‘sent up the River’ to die in Old Smokey - the infamous and reviled electric chair used by the Sing Sing guards to execute criminals. Once out of our reach, with our recent reacquisition of Upstate New York, both the town of Ossining and Sing Sing inside it are now under our complete control. Seeking to spit in the face of our former captors and the lawmen who killed so many of our brothers and made-men, the Commission has moved to suggest one of two plans for what to do with this infamous landmark. We could just burn the entire prison to the ground as a final goodbye to that wretched lot, taking Old Spark as a trophy and perhaps even a tool against future enemies, but some within our ranks see that as wasteful and short-sighted. These detractors instead suggest that we renovate and bug all of Sing Sing, making it our own prison to throw in political and criminal rivals, as well as any other enemies of the state. The final say is up to the Boss, so what shall it be?"

NYC.48.t:0 "Honoring ‘The Brain’"
NYC.48.d:0 "This rainy November marks the 10 year anniversary since the murder of Arnold ‘The Brain’ Rothstein - the father of modern organized crime and the man who transformed our craft from a thuggist activity by gangsters and hoodlums into a respectable, corporate enterprise. Infamous for fixing the 1919 World Series and for building the largest criminal empire America had ever seen before the rise of our Commission, Rothstein is honored by all within the Commission, not forgetting that it was he who first mentored men like Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, and others in the ways of our business. Savagely gunned down just a decade ago, his death shattered the status quo of the City, sending Tammany Hall - which he was paid-off by to control the streets - on their way towards collapse but opened the door for the La Guardia and eventually our Commission to rise to take his place. \n\nNow, we remember Rothstein as the genius whose sweat, blood, tears, and life went into making what we do today possible. The hospital in which he died in - the Stuyvesant Polyclinic Hospital in Manhattan - has been renamed in his honor, and statues of Rothstein have been built both outside the hospital and outside City Hall, which we now control. Even on his deathbed, Rothstein was an honorable made-man, refusing to give up the name of the man who shot him, stating to the police inquiring ‘You stick to your trade, I’ll stick to mine’ and that ‘Me mudder did it’ before finally giving up the ghost. Rothstein is survived by his brother Harry, a Rabbi in a local Brooklyn synagogue with ties to our allies in the Jewish Mafia, and has been given a large share of his brother’s fortune since his death. The rest has been used and reused to fund our enterprise and now we shall seek to live up to his honorable legacy as we rebuild NYC in his image."

NYC.49.d:0 "Though we have long been the kingpins of the underworld here in the Big Apple, we are far from the only source of corruption and sin. Both the City Council along with the wider state government and the NYPD have their own internal demons, but no official organization is more openly corrupt than Tammany Hall. Officially called the Society of Saint Tammany, the Hall is a political machine for the pro-Irish and pro-WASP conservative Democrats that runs on bribes and sin like we do, but they exist in the political world while we openly embrace the shadows we dwell in. With our power and rule cemented, we must decide what to do with Tammany Hall, lest they become an obstacle later. Long having tacit and quiet ties to both our syndicates and especially with the Irish Mafia, many have suggested that we put a leash on Tammany Hall, forcing them to do our bidding as an arm of our outfit, while others instead suggest that we tear this rotten structure down once and for all. Tammany Hall and its Bosses could certainly be of use to us, but perhaps it is just best to send them sleeping with the fishes."

NYC.50.d:0 "Sitting in a dark study smoking a cigar and sipping cognac, Lucky Luciano contemplated his life and his future as he awaited to celebrate the day of his daughter’s wedding with his wife, the talented vaudeville dancer Gay Orlova. With all of the Big Apple in the palm of his hands, Luciano now stood as the uncontested kingpin of New York, the Boss of Bosses, the one and only Godfather. Though he still worked cooperatively with the Families and his associates, and though he did not style himself as a king or a dictator, there was no delusion in anyone’s mind that Luciano was not the sole leader and final word in the underworld we inhabit. Expanding operations outwards to places Luciano has visited and fancies such as Rome, Naples, Cuba, and beyond, Luciano has lived up to his moniker - ever lucky and ever mercurial, able to dodge trouble with ease on his way to the top. None can stand in his way, and none can refuse his offers, for he is the Capo di Tutti i Capi, and soon, his name and title shall become synonymous with what it means to be a criminal. Luciano has succeeded where all other crime bosses before him have failed, signaling to all that the Don Lucky Luciano is no mere lowly gangsters; he is the one and only Godfather."

NYC.51.d:0 "As infamous a womanizer as he is a mobster, Lucky Luciano has always been known for his love of the fairer sex. Though he is married to the talented and famous Broadway dancer Gay Orlova, with whom he has had one daugher with, Luciano has continued to stray outside his marriage time and time again. The most recent scandal, and the one to reach national attention, has been his steamy affair with the young Milanese ballerina Igea Lissoni. Nearly 20 years his junior, Lissoni is barely an adult, being born in 1920, but that hasn’t stopped Luciano from proclaiming her as the love of his life. Though he and Orlova have stayed together to keep appearances and because of the Catholic Church’s position on divorce, the young Lissoni is undeniably Lucy Luciano’s goomar, or mistress. Though this will do little to hurt his position of power, it has gone a long way to make his home life miserable for the time being."

Along with this new trade network - all of which is just barely above board and legal if that even matters now with the Mob in complete control, and thus untouchable - Lansky has also moved to set up gambling spots and prostitution rings in Cuba itself and throughout the rest of the free Carribean in order to make some extra money on the side. While much of the profit from these ventures shall make its way back to the Big Apple for the Commission to use, some of it shall instead be diverted to new offshore accounts protected by the Cuban government. Here, our illicit and stained money shall be safe from prying eyes as Lansky seeks to make a legitimate business churning out more profits than ever before out of our criminal empire."

Whether those who hire us be other criminal outfits, government officials, or merely private citizens, we do not care, for their cash is good all the same. All that matters is that Murder, Inc. always get their man. With squads headed by the Lord High Executioner Bugsy Siegel himself, as well as by bigwigs within our outfit such as Harry Greenberg, Louis ‘Lepke’ Buchalter, Tommy ‘Three-Fingered Brown’ Lucchese, Albert ‘The Mad Hatter’ Anastasia, Abe ‘Kid Twist’ Reles, Martin ‘Buggsy’ Goldstein, Jacob ‘Gurrah’ Shapiro, and even Harry ‘Pittsburgh Phil’ Strauss - the most prolific killer within our ranks with over 500 kills to his name - this new enterprise shall surely not fail our future clientele as it rises to become the main form of income for our syndicate. Equipped with his beloved Maria - a 1935 Browning Hi-Power semi-automatic handgun plated in silver, etched and damascened with a beautifully flowing pattern of ivy and flora, and with a pearl grip emblazoned with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe - Bugsy Siegel himself has already claimed the lives of untold scores, and with his suit-clad hitsquads and the full power of both Murder, Inc. and NYC at his back, this new American Mafia shall be unstoppable as it seeks to run and gun its way into national prominence across the lands of the failed Union and beyond."

NYC.54.d:0 "Seeking to end all infighting between the various outfits and gangs within this diverse city can seem like an impossible task, but not for the likes of Charles ‘Lucky’ Luciano. Already ridding himself of the staunch rivals that suppressed his climb to power during the Castellammarese Crime War, Luciano has seized control of the Big Apples underworld with the help of the Five Families. These families - the Bonanno Family, the Profaci Family, the Mangano Family, the Gagliano Family, and the Luciano Family - each owns, operates, and organizes a sector of our operations as well as a section of the City’s territory, but for far too long they had been at war. With the rise of Luciano, his main promise has been to end the infighting and needless bloodshed between the Families in order to secure greater profits through cooperation. Though many resisted this push at first, those who did have either jumped on board or jumped into a grave, and as such, Luciano has little opposition to stop him. Refusing to break the structure of the families, and refusing to name himself the Boss of Bosses though some say he already effectively is, Luciano has united the Five Families, bringing about an atmosphere of rough harmony and hesitant cooperation. This newly reformed National Crime Syndicate, headed by the Commission equally as a council shall run this newly united criminal empire, and with Luciano standing as the dedicated visionary guiding us along, he has risen to become the most powerful and respected man in New York City, both by the Families and the masses."

However, since Luciano’s arrival in NYC, he and Lansky grew to be close confidants and friends, sharing a similar outlook on the future of their criminal empire. With these ties to the two most dominant men in the Commission aside from Lansky himself, The Mob’s Accountant is in a unique position to foster unity and cooperation between the rival factions within their outfits. Seeking to stop infighting in pursuit of peace and greater profits, Lansky has forced these two time-weathered allies to set aside their differences in order to create the National Crime Syndicate, which is to be headed by the Mobster Unity Front - a new face for the fracturious Commission. This unified, cohesive body containing all the outfits, bosses, and hierarchies of the organizations that make it up shall represent our new and shared direction. Under Meyer Lansky, with Lucky Luciano and Bugsy Siegel at his side, populism, prosperity, profits, and more shall grace our Big Apple, and together united as one, we shall make the greatest city on earth."

Seeing no other alternative, believing that the long they waited the more likely it would be that their enemies would unify and attack, a campaign of terror and shock has temporarily consumed the City that Never Sleeps. With blood-hungry allies on his flanks like Albert ‘The Mad Hatter’ Anastasia, Louis ‘Lepke’ Buchalter, and the infamous Pittsburgh Phil, all foes shall fall before our hail of lead, for the City shall be ours in its entirety."

However, with the rise and eventual fall of the honorable and respected former Italian-Jewish mayor La Guardia to the rise of our very own Commission, Italians and our Jewish allies - once both subjected to the same oppression - have come to control the City and its fate. With our Italian-Jewish coalition in power, [root.getleader] has seen fit to undo this history of oppression in order to finally reward our intertwined peoples for their stubbornness in the face of anguish. \n\nIn addition to repealing all laws that were discriminatory to Itlaina and Jewish New Yorkers, the head bosses have decided to grant further reparations to our two communities. In order to appease the more dominant Italian factions such as the Five Families and the numerous lesser gangs we have absorbed, the religious leadership of New York’s Catholic diocese shall be gradually and quietly replaced with Italian Catholics with close ties to our organizations, while all discriminatory city ordinances against Italian immigration shall be lifted, with Ellis Island itself getting a major refit and expansion in preparation for new waves of new faces from Italy. To appease to the members of the Jewish Mafia and the Jewish half of Murder, Inc., new synagogues of various Judaic sects are to be built across the City so all schools of Judaism may have a place in the Big Apple. Additionally, an all-encompassing eruv - or a hanging wire that wraps around NYC, creating a halakhic enclosure that denotes an area as private domain for Jews observing Shabbat  - shall be built all around the Five Boroughs so that the most devout of our Jewish brethren may live their modern lives while still paying homage to our traditional rules. \n\nWith these steps and more, we shall come to embrace the differences between us while what we do have in common strengthens our bonds in perpetuity.

From the poorest blocks in Brooklyn or the Bronx to the richest neighborhoods in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, each and every soul within this fine city is now ours to care for. Taking notes from Lucky Luciano’s planned strategy for Chicago before his former ally Al Capone ran him out of the city, we shall institute a program of ‘Mobster Populism.’ Though we shall still be our old criminal selves, the infighting and violence between our rival groups must end once and for all so that blood no longer stains the streets of the City. By working together, we shall be able to make more profit than ever before, and in turn, we shall use those profits not only to enrich ourselves and our families as was the original goal of these groups, but also to enrich the lives of every New Yorker. On a foundation of corruption and graft, we shall build a criminally-backed welfare state for the greatest of the American people. New Yorkers shall finally be secure and cared for by their government - a government built on organized crime - for the first time in their history, and together, we shall make the City that Never Sleeps the greatest city on Earth!"

NYC.59.t:0 "Cutting into New Ventures"
NYC.59.d:0 "For decades, our criminal outfits and the gangs and squads that came before us have lived on a staple selection of criminal activities. From prostitution and call-girl rings to counterfeit building contracts and labor rackets to loan sharking, extortion, racketeering, gambling, bootlegging, numbers games, tobacco smuggling, secretive immigration from Italy, and more, there are not many crimes that our made-men won’t dabble in. However, there have also always been taboos, such as the drug-trade aside from tobacco operations, and full-on human trafficking. Crimes like these have rarely been attempted by members of our organizations or our precursors, and all those who have dabbled in them have since been black-marked by the Commission if they are still even alive at all. However, the rising chaos of the 2nd American Civil War has led to a complete breakdown in moral decency and standards across the lands of the burning Union, opening a new avenue towards profit. \n\nBy linking up with suppliers of illicit substances in Asia, Africa, and South America, we shall begin to import drugs like opium, hashish, and cocaine into the nation in order to sell it to foreign sources. However, it has been declared that none of this poison shall be sold on our own streets or within our own neighborhoods, lest their filth infect the minds of our masses. Furthermore, we shall begin to establish connections with war-torn areas both within the lands of the old Union and beyond, making money off the safe transport of refugees and asylum-seekers. Though there were offers from more shadowy sources requesting we also allow the smuggling of slaves and serfs, we have staunchly denied these requests, not seeking to make money off the servitude of others. Though we shall walk this dark path, we shall do so lightly and with care, so as to stay true to our Catholic and Jewish faiths, as well as to remain true to our traditional principles. We may be criminals, we may be murderers, but we are not evil men, and we refuse to lower ourselves to such base and savage acts."

The term has become so widespread that the Big Apple has even earned itself yet another new nickname - the Gangster’s Paradise. In this new paradise, we run the new central and neutral hub of the entire global criminal economy. New York City now stands as the meeting place between international criminal groups such as the Triads or the Senussi Order, allowing all of our ilk to do business in a safe space, all while we take a cut of every deal and double-cross made in this shadowy eden. All criminals of all walks of life and specialization, from the molasses and rum runners of the Caribbean to the Kot and Hashish dealers of North Africa, shall be welcomed within this pearly gates, and together we shall legitimize our practice and make fortunes for ourselves all under the radar of the wider world."

However, the first we have decided to point our sights at is the Brooklyn Camorra. \n\nOnce rivaling our precursor organizations before the rise of the Commission, the Camorra is another loose confederation of Italian immigrants primarily from Naples figure-headed by the likes of Giosue Gallucci and Alessandro Vollero, among others. Far less cohesive and cooperative than our group, and insignificant by comparison to our current strength, these fellow Italians still prove to be a thorn in our side from time to time, and the Bosses have come to a rare agreement that something must be done. The position we take here against the Camorra is likely the position the Bosses shall take on other lesser groups in the future, so we must be careful in our choice now. Should we move forward to make peace, integrate, and assimilate the Camorra and other groups like them in the future, or should we gun down or imprison each and every soul that thinks they can stand against La Cosa Nostra?"

Looking down upon the people that once spat upon him and with Murder, Inc. at his back, Bugsy stands as the most powerful man in all of New York, and yet he still craves more. With the help of his childhood friend and long-time confidant Meyer Lansky, Bugsy has lived the epitome of the rags-to-riches story on a platform of vice, crime, graft, and above all, violence. With the chaos of the Civil War abating, Bugsy is now free to leave the confines of the City that Never Sleeps in order to spread his influence across America as Luciano and Capone before him had tried. \n\nWith much of the local urban centers near NYC already being under our control in one way or another through the many tentacles of Murder, Inc., Bugsy has set his sights on a far more distant target. Seeing great potential in the small, sleepy GI town of Las Vegas on the other side of the country, Siegel has partnered with local developer and owner of the Flamingo Hotel William R. Wilkerson, and has ordered numerous operators and made-men to move out to the desert in order to begin setting up a new gambling oasis in the South of Nevada. Envisioning a Strip gilded in neon and steel, lined with casinos, gambling halls, burlesques, and other shacks of sin and debauchery headed by his flagship casino The Tops, Siegel seeks to pave Las Vegas in gold in order to create the new gambling capital of the world. If all goes well out on the Stip, Bugsy plans to extend operations to other distant cities such as Los Angelese and Miami in order to amplify the profit coming in as he seeks to skyrocket Murder, Inc. into a whole new level of decadence and success. Though it will take years to get these operations set up, Bugsy always hits what he’s aiming for, so let us hope that the House does indeed always win, lest this whole venture be a colossal waste of money."

NYC.63.d:0 "Though we have risen to control most criminal activity within the Big Apple and across the Eastern Seaboard, a giant far larger than we now looms in the West, led by an old ally-turned-rival of our Lucky Luciano - the one and only Al Capone. Long before Luciano came to NYC to start the Commission with Lansky and the rest of the Five Families, he was one of the crime lords of Chicago, seeking to end the infighting between the gangs in order to provide better profits and prosperity to both the people of Chicago as well as their own criminal syndicates. However, Al Capone - ever the power-hungry and unhinged meathead - wanted Chicago all to himself, and so he worked tirelessly running all of his competition out of town, including our Lucky Luciano. \n\nIt has been over a decade since this split, and though Capone and Luciano have their past and their differences, perhaps now is the time to finally burry that hatchet. Capone controls most of old America, and from our isolated position in NYC, we are in little position to oppose him. With our shared love of Mobster Populism, and with Capone’s mental state deteriorating each day due to his rampant syphilis, Capone has seemed to change his tune, offering Luciano and our Commission a spot side-by-side Capone in this new world of Mobster Populism and faux-Totalism. We could ally with his outfit once more, either as an equal partner or as a subservient syndicate, but these options taste bitter in the mouth of Luciano. Though he wishes the best for all Americans under his National Crime Syndicate, he also still reviles Capone, and wishes to see his head on a spike. We could simply ignore Capone’s offer and go about our way, or perhaps we could even launch a surprise attack against him in an attempt to dethrone this Gangster King, replacing him with Luciano as the face of all North American organized crime.

Getting drunk on local booze far too strong for their inexperienced livers, a group of rookie soldiers belonging to the Bronx Outfit - itself one of the hundreds of individual gangs and syndicates under the unified banner of the Commission - got far too rowdy and hot-headed for their own good. After a way-too-long night of drinking, whoring, and general debauchery, these ‘geniuses’ decided it would be a good idea to disturb the peace of our good city by setting fire to the NYPD’s main headquarters. Walking up to the NYPD’s Department Headquarters at 240 Centre Street between Broome and Grand with cans of oil, improvised firebombs, and lighters in tow, these idiotic and intoxicated miscreants doused the entire innately decorated, Greco-Roman designed exterior of the building in gasoline in the dead of night before hurling homemade Hoover Cocktails and zippo lighters at the structure, causing a massive inferno that would nearly reduce the entire block to cinders. \n\nWith one of the culprits dying in the incident - himself burning alive after standing too close to the flames while reeking of alcohol and with a flask in hand - some believe justice has already been served, but the Dons know better. These idiots have ruined the relative calm we had established, while also angering the NYPD who had before this point become our loyal and well-paid puppets.

Though Prohibition failed to pass on the national level before the outbreak of the 2ACW, it did pass in some states and counties, and the memory of such an idea has not gone out peacefully. The Trump administration has introduced this new ‘dry’ bill to the Senate, and now the wider government of the Big Apple is currently voting on its outcome. Though many view this to be a good, moral, and pious cause that will better the moral fiber of NYC while alieving some of society's darkest ailments, many others believe this to be an infringement on personal liberties and freedoms inherent in being part of the old Union. Furthermore, the Mob and other criminal outfits have viscerally opposed this bill, seeing it as an attack on their enterprise, while others simply see this as being bad for the economy. However, Trump is certain that alcohol not only breeds crime, but also corruption and laziness - especially among the Irish and within the Catholic-dominated NYPD.

Funnily enough, the mob was also greatly relieved, not eager to resume underground bootlegging and risking prison time, and as such, all across NYC, the Reform Party has seen a small uptick in support while the economy has seen a small boom as well.

The dastardly Canucks to the North, jaded over our decision to turn away from Ottawa to seek other allies and fearful that our Big Apple might end up in the arms of Canada’s rivals, have been caught attempting to infiltrate and sabotage our proud and newly independent nation. \n\nOut on the shores of Long Island, 100 miles outside NYC near the town of Amagansett, a small Canadian submersible landed in the dead of night, releasing four trained Canadian saboteurs from the Canadian Special Service Force onto our shores. Their task - named Operation Cornwallis after famous British general during the American Revolutionary War, and planned by Canuck admiral Louis Mountbatten and authorized by the infamous ‘Spartan General’ Bernard Montgomery - was to infiltrate New York society while carrying out acts of sabotage against key industrial and military installations, including the vital Hell Gate rail bridge, the Aluminum Company of New York’s processing plants, Penn Station, and the Brooklyn Naval Yard, among other varied and less specific targets.  Each of the four saboteurs were given counterfeit birth certificates, draft deferment cards, driver’s licenses, and a total of nearly $200,000 in starting cash. However, despite a smooth landing and an expected mission time of 2 years, one among their numbers betrayed his comrades within only a few days after landing. Refusing to commit terrorist acts against innocent civilians in a nation Canada was not even officially at war with, the one saboteur with a conscience first called the NYPD before walking into their headquarters 4 days later with all incriminating evidence in hand and willing to squeal, leading to the entire operation falling apart. \n\nAfter being caught by the NYPD, the four were put on trial and charged with a slew of crimes as the New York judicial system threw the book at these attempted war criminals. After a swift and speedy trial, the four men were each charged, with the one saboteur who betrayed his comrades only getting 30 years in prison after he provided the court with all intel documents and information he could provide, while of his companions, one would be handed a life sentence while the final two would be given the death sentence and eventually hanged after a brief sting in holding. \n\nAll in all, Operation Cornwallis was a failure, but has reignited anti-Canadian sentiments within our Big Apple, with the people of Long Island feeling especially betrayed and vulnerable. As such, our Mayor has stoked these anti-Canuck feelings to bolster his own support, while moving to fortify Long Island to appease his most distant supporters."

He died of a snapped neck,  as a result of tripping over the leash of his wife’s small dog, which he was walking at her bequest. Bonaparte, despite being related to one of the most impressive and decorated military and political figures in recent history, led quite the mediocre life, perhaps as a result of living in the shadow of Napoleon himself. Having inherited a small fortune from his father Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II, Jerome married Blanche Pierce and simply lived his life, fathering no children, and leading what some have called a 'useless existence.' With his death, he leaves whatever fortune he had left to his wife and their dog, who was found along with his body by the NYPD. Due to his status as the last named member of the American branch of the House of Bonaparte, a small declaration was given from City Hall, expressing their condolences to the House of Bonaparte, as well as Bonaparte's late wife.

NYC_flavor.3343.d:0 "With our independent state now coming to control the entirety of the Virgin Islands - the homeland of both Crosswaith and Harrison - great jubilation and celebration has erupted among the small but loud Virgin Islander minority in the Big Apple. Seeking to ride this wave of public support towards new heights while also seeking to further connect our modern people with our hard and sometimes agonizing history, [root.getleader] has announced the creation of a new public holiday. \n\nHeld in honor of the St. John Slave Revolt of 1733, this new holiday commemorate the starting of this revolt, which began on November 23rd when 150 Ghana-born Akwamu slaves on the Danish-controlled islands took up arms in a heroic and noble but ultimately futile attempt to break their chains. With this new day of remembrance, which has also come to be a day to celebrate all anti-Slavery struggles from the Maroon Wars of Jamaica to Louverture’s Revolution in Haiti, we give thanks to these proud forefathers of the Black Struggle that came before us while also showcasing how far we have come since those dark days."

NYC_flavor.3344.d:0 "With the start of our revolutionary movement beginning in Harlem, it is only natural that many within our group have or still do cooperate with the Harlem Kingpins. Standing atop all the crime groups of Harlem aside from maybe Luciano’s Commission which only grows weaker by the day, Casper Holstein and Stephanie St. Claire are the most successful and infamous Black mobsters in the City. Despite both being advocates of Civil Rights, and despite Holstein’s push for pseudo-Socialist populism and St. Clair’s push for Liberal Feminism, at the end of the day, they are still calculating villains that control a mob of thugs, murderders, and snakes, and as such many within in the Party want them in prison. However, there exists a group within our government that holds firm on the idea that these mobsters can be moderated and leashed to suit our purposes, able to do jobs quietly and without direct links to our administration. We must decide what our position towards these Kingpins should be, before they get too comfortable in this new New York."

Seeking to break the chains that ensnare the hearts and minds of the masses so that all may choose their own path in life and start upon such an odyssey with equal footing and ample safety nets, this ‘Black Socrates’ will usher in a new golden age for the Big Apple supported by humanism, egalitarian philosophy, and open nationalism for all races."

Pushing for the illegalization of organized religion, which would force religion and spiritual practice to be a private affair to be handled in private, the idea of Agnostic Atheism is simple - it is not our place nor even possible to determine whether there is a God or not, so we must instead work to create a Heaven on Earth for all to enjoy. With the City’s massive Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish populations all in an uproar against this plan, numerous Socialist and Liberal groups have come forward showing their support. The final choice is up to Mayor [root.getleader], but we must walk carefully, for this is a delicate situation, and though the pay-off may be great eventually, there is sure to be many growing pains on the path there - pains we are not sure our infantile administration can survive.

Father of modern Black Nationalism, founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, and the founder of the Black-supremacist Garveyite movement, Marcus Garvey is one of the leading global authority’s on the Black Struggle. In a shock to all however, flying in the face of his generally conservative stances, Garvey has applauded the efforts of our administration. Though he is wary of our alliance with White Socialists, he has proclaimed that our Big Apple may be the ‘Black Mecca’ all have been searching for. \n\nSeeking to see this paradise-in-progress for himself, Garvey has taken a trip from his exile in Liberia and Jamaica to come to New York. However, his arrival has also caused an uptick in Black Nationalist and Racial Suprmeacist rhetoric - the very antithesis of our regime. With Garvey hoping to purchase a secondary residence in Harlem in order to finally return - at least part time - to American soil, many within our cabinet are wary of this radical spending even a few weeks here, while others have welcomed his arrival with open arms. We must establish an official and public stance to Garvey, and with Harrison’s and Crosswaith’s history abandoning the movement, many expect the Party to ban him from the City.

Named after the supreme council of the ancient Hebrew people as described in the First Book of the Maccabees - a name chosen over apparent similarities between the Black and Jewish struggles - the Sanhedrin was also known as the ‘All-Race Conference’, and as such was not rooted in any sense of Black nationalism or supremacism.

Wishing to spread this join to the masses, he has created a new and modernized air corp for the Big Apple, headed by himself and surviving volunteer veterans of the Great War from America like the Hellfighters and the Tuskegee Airmen to fill out the ranks of its initial general staff and officer corp, while inviting Black men and women from across Greater Harlem to come learn the joys and applications, both military and civilian, of flight. \n\nHowever, despite owning a fleet of private aircraft, he must lie to his parish and those in the clergy about such lavish spending, stating that they are all only owned out of necessity, and that all are always gifts from foreign dignitaries (which at least some are) and all are kept empty or low on fuel to save money for the wider state and the needs of Allah and our growing Church. Despite these weak deflections, the wider masses accept the words of their authoritarian Mufti as he flies through the skies of New York and beyond, keeping him at peace as he tries to touch the heavens themselves."

An anti-Semite himself like many Black Nationalists within America, Lawson is interestingly not opposed to the existence of Black Hebrews so long as they have their own congregations supported by Black nationalist ideas, and this general rule he carries to all religions including Islam and Christianity. However, he has recently begun to specifically vouch for the African Orthodox Church founded by high-ranking UNIA member and personal friend of Marcus Garvey, Bishop George Alexander McGuire. A devoted Black nationalist and Pan-African himself, McGuire pursues ecclesiastical independence for Blacks in America, creating a moral and just society based on Christian tradition and social teachings fused with Garveyite thought. Supporting academic reform, literacy campaigns, and known for his charity work throughout the lands of the Black Diaspora in the New World, McGuire is a trusted man and his religion has been officially endorsed by Lawson's government.

A living god, according to his followers, Kimbangu is the Holy Spirit reincarnate, or so he says, further claiming that his sons complete the Holy Trinity manifested on Earth, preaching the apparent truth that Christianity originated in the Congo, where the Garden of Eden was originally located. Furthermore, this pacifistic and puritan faith preaches that all the original figures of Christianity from the Apostles to God himself are Black - a commonly rebuked truth shared by any proud Black Nationalist and a depiction personally defended by Lawson in public debate. Working with the Kimbanguist Church, a branch of the religion has been founded in New York City, with the St. Patrick’s Cathedral was converted into a Kimbanguist house of worship.

The other side instead supports a ‘separate and not equal’ policy where Whites would live by our rules as second-class citizens without a right to vote in any form of government and lacking their own political autonomy. However, they would still be cared for by some government programs and protected from harm just as any other citizen; they just would not have the same freedoms as Blacks do, akin to a more moderate form of old pre-segregation Jim Crow-era America.

We could either stand proud with the founders of our movement Ira Kemp, Arthur Reed, and Hammie Snipes, or we could instead put a more familiar, popular, and widely beloved face in the position of power such as Langston Hughes or Claude McKay, both masters of the literary arts, fathers of the Harlem Renaissance, and leading Black Socialists and Nationalists aimed at the revival of our peoples’ shared culture and identity.

Even more suspiciously, the only survivor of the crash was Hamid’s White secretary Catherine Price, who lived with only serious but survivable injuries. The sole survivor Price has been used as a scapegoat and easy culprit for the tragedy, being found guilty of sabotage and sentenced to death, but many suspect our own administration to be at fault due to our past conflicts with Hamid and his ideology, while others suspect his wife and influential Harlem crime lord Stephanie St. Clair to be behind it instead.

Citing their reason as being an act of protest in response to the Second American Civil War, these beatniks have largely just been playing music, singing, drinking, smoking, and all-around enjoying themselves as they ‘protest’ in the name of American peace. However, these fools lack any long-term source of food or even fresh water, not to mention any other amenities on that tiny strip of man-made rock. The Police Department has already been informed and have moved to surround Manhattan’s smallest island with patrol craft and police boats in order to monitor the situation. All the Mayor must do now is to decide whether to move in and forcibly remove these hippies from Belmont Island, or should we simply just sit back and let these animals realize the mess they are in."

NYC_flavor.26.d:0 "Founded in 1935 as a result of Fr. Charles Coughlin's call for a 'crusade against the anti-Christian forces of the Red Revolution,' the Christian Front has become New York City's largest and most predominate Longist organization, although Coughlin himself denies having direct ties to the group. Headed by entrepreneur and self-made ANI-inspired politician Generoso Pope, Protestant fundementalist and rabid anti-semite Joe McWilliams, and Brooklyn-based Bishop Thomas Edmund Molloy, the Front is highly supportive of the NYPD and is alleged to have helped the Boys in Blue during the initial clean up following the Battle of New York. Besides Long and the NYPD, the Front is incredibly linked to and perhaps even a part of the Tammany machine due to Pope’s efforts, although both the Front and Tammany deny this, saying their relationship doesn't go past vocal support. Also sporting tacit ties to the Front is Fred Trump, who quietly supports the movement while simultaneously slandering it in public for its cooperation with Catholics. \n\nSince the beginning of our independence a short time ago, these anti-Semitic 'crusaders' have stepped up their attempts to rid the Big Apple of 'Judeo-Syndicalist' infiltration, mostly by targeting Jewish business owners with boycotts, but reports of direct assaults on Jews by members of the Front have been reported. With this being the case, a group of private citizens from all walks of life have reached out to the government in secret, and have requested that we deal with the Front. Offering what they call damning evidence of the Front's crimes, this group wishes to see the Front gone for good. With this group plus the rising reports of attacks and other such acts from the Front's membership, they can no longer be ignored. Despite this, the government is split on just how to deal with the Front, and thus a few options are open for us to consider."

With the sudden and suspicious early retirements of many key figures within our ranks, and with even a few members ending up mysteriously dead in recent weeks, some bosses have begun to fear the worst. Though the CF has done wonders in increasing Tammany’s hold over the City, they have done so by increasing their own position of power and influence as well, causing many to fear the worst is yet to come.

As the three main figures of the group, Generoso Pope, Joe McWilliams, and Bishop Molloy are the clear candidates to lead, but who among them will rule alone is the question on everyone’s mind. \n\nGeneroso Pope’s ties to Tammany Hall are what allowed our attempt at power to even begin, but his piety and dedication to Catholic principles is shaky at best, with many believing him to be an opportunist merely grasping at the chance for power. Politically, he is a disciple of D’Annunzio and Italo Balbo, espousing ANI-inspired Corporatist economics and Legionarist political ideas. However, he is also the least anti-semitic of the three main leaders of the CF, and does not wish to do anything drastic to the City’s hebrew population. \n\nOn the other side of the CF is Joe McWilliams, a raging anti-semite and anti-communist hell bent on ‘purifying’ New York City and bringing about a Protestant non-democratic republic under an all-powerful Mayor with close ties to the Protestant churches across the state. Violently anti-capitalist, McWilliams also espouses Corporatism influenced by the Prosperity Gospel and the increase in state security and public surveillance, though distrusts the heavily Catholic NYPD. \n\nFinally, standing as the unity candidate between the two camps is Brooklyn-based Catholic Bishop Thomas Edmund Molloy. Once just a supporter of the CF, Molloy fully entered their ranks a few years ago and has quickly risen to the top of the hierarchy by preaching a fusion of Father Coughlin’s and Padre Pio’s ideas. This has evolved into a form of Pan-Christian thought that ignores differences in sects in order to promote Christian Unity so as to be a unified front against Christianity’s true enemies such as the Jews, Socialism, Liberalism, and other similar ideas. Supportive of anti-Socialist Christian Unionism, Distributism, and Christian exceptionalism, Molloy seeks to keep the CF together by embracing what their members all have in common. However, only one can truly lead the CF, so who shall rise to be the new face of both the Christian Front and the Big Apple?"

Some have taken this ‘King of the World’ at his word and have begun to celebrate the imminent Return. Meanwhile others, including many in our government, remain skeptical. However, despite his blasphemy, his words obviously carry weight and some of our less disturbed ministers have put forward a suggestion that he be allowed to join the Front, despite the fact his ‘Church of God of Prophecy’ has officially split from our Church.

Taking the Italian title of Duce as his new moniker, using it more often than his official title as Mayor, Pope seeks to make a paradise here for his fellow Italian-Americans. Using his media connections and even his own newspaper - Il Progresso Italo-Americano - Pope has begun to spread his propaganda so that all in the Big Apple may feel the glory of this new system. Furthermore, to support his kin and constituents, Pope has moved to create a new Italian-American holiday - Columbus Day. Commemorating the arrival of the famous Italian explorer, this new holiday shall be celebrated each year with a massive parade similar to the ones we hold at Thanksgiving and Christmas.

As panic spreads, people have begun to turn on their friends and family, calling them out as Judeo-Syndicalists even if they have never dabbled in Socialism or Jewry. Furthermore, the Mayor has gone ahead with the creation of the McWilliams Act, which makes it illegal to plot to overthrow the government, punishable by life in prison or death. This act is expected to be used as an excuse for McWilliam’s and the Chrisitian Mobilizers, along with their puppeted allies in the NYPD, to arrest or kill every Leftist in NYC.

However there are others who have a differing view. They see the wide ranging influence Tammany still has as a potential boon to our rule and a way to extend our influence Upstate.

With this in mind, and with the question of Civil Rights on everyone’s minds, the CF must decide on a path going forward. We could either ignore these wretches, not actively harming them but not actively helping them either as we slowly try to influence them to leave our shining city on the hill. Alternatively, we could take a far more drastic and violent approach, harkening to America’s legacy as the lynch and angry mob capital of the Western World, and deal with these minorities in a more permanent matter, but this will likely face a great deal of pushback as we effectively declare war on half the City.

Drugs are being seized and destroyed every day. Porn has virtually vanished from the hands and hearts of the people. In their place churches have sprung up like oak trees, with some neighborhoods having four or five churches all to themselves.

Despite being a Bishop of the Catholic Church and ultimately being subject to His Holiness the Pope, Molloy has stood firm, and has sought to develop a mode of governance that fits both the Catholic and Protestant faithful. In his quest for the perfect system to fit this vision, Molloy found what he considered to be the best baseline he could find, namely the ideology of Catholic freedom fighter, priest and holy man, Francesco Forgione better known as Padre Pio. Pio's beliefs, known to the wider world as Padre Pio Thought, seeks to create a society in which every person has the best chance to become a Saint, and enter into God's Kingdom. For Pio, this means the removal and destruction of ideology and nationhood itself. While a bit much for Molly's tastes, Padre Pio Thought, albeit in a heavily modified form, does form the basis of his Mayorship over the Big Apple. \n\nSurprisingly enough, it seems that Padre Pio himself, despite being actively engaged in southern Italy, had actually heard of Molly and the Christian Front, as he was recently held for a state visit. Arriving without prior warning and simply walking up to City Hall, Pio and Molly would spend much of Pio's 12 hour visit simply discussing theology and matters of state. Just what they talked about is unknown, but it seems likely that Pio condemned the more radical changes made to 'Pioism,' namely his treatment of minorities. For the remainder of his visit, Pio toured around the city. Upon the completion of the tour, Pio headed for the docks and vanished into the crowd.

More interesting still however, is that just shortly after the news broke, a plane landed at New York International, dropping off a small group of dedicated Italian nationalists hoping to resist the Reds back home. Led by Italo Balbo - genius behind the modern ANI movement and close friend of Mayor Pope through correspondence - the group now seeks asylum here in the Big Apple as they plot and scheme a way to take back their homeland. However, seeing an opportunity like none other, our ‘Duce’ has expressed his willingness to fully aid in Balbo’s efforts. Offering economic aid or even total support in any coming war, Pope has announced solidarity with these fleeing sons of Italy, but now we must finally decide on an actual plan.

We could easily create a new puppet administration based in Rome and headed by the returned Balbo, but behind closed doors, our Duce only craves more. Calling our ANI allies failures and fake-Italians, Pope seeks to fully rule over Italy himself as the Duce of both the Big Apple and the mainland of our ancestors.

We could reach out to both Berlin and New Orleans, offering to give up our own sovereignty to appease the Union State in order to broker an alliance between them and the Kaiserreich by raising McWilliams to be foreign ambassador to Germany. We would end this war peacefully, and our regime would be given respectable positions in government as long as we would be willing to give up our independence and secure an alliance with the Kaiser. \n\nDoing so would be possible, for McWilliams has strong, close friends in high places in Germany, but doing so would also be a compromise to our hard-fought and ever-harder maintained independence.

With America now under their belt, the Front has begun rebuilding the nation, modeling it on the successful transformation of New York City from the City that Never Sleeps to the City that Never Sins. Banning things such as pornography and labor on the Lord's Day, while implementing laws to limit the sale of things like Alcohol or Tobacco, the reformation of America into God's Image is well and truly on the way. Along with transformation of America's moral life, the Christian Front has also seen fit to reform the economy of America. Long seen as the great Land of Opportunity, American Capitalism and the rampant love of money over anything else has become economic target number one of the Front's new Union. Taking inspiration from Catholic Social Teaching, the Front has begun to implement what they call 'American Distributism,' which seeks to create an economy were private property is spread as far as possible, and yet still allows for the massive industrial sector that America is known far to exist in an integral whole. Culturally, the Front is quietly pushing Irish, Italian and WASP cultural programs across the entire nation. By doing this, the Front hopes to use it's political backbone to both strengthen it's own position while using the 'natural piety' of these groups to inspire similar piety in the various other people groups that make up America. Regardless, under the Front, America shall be made Holy again, no matter the cost."

NYC_flavor.27.t:0 "Repairing New York’s Cathedral"
NYC_flavor.27.d:0 "St. Patrick’s Cathedral is the heart of the Catholic faith in New York, and stands as the largest Gothic Revival Cathedral in all of North America. First founded and designed in the 1850s by James Renwick Jr. and dedicated in 1879 - as well as in 1910 when it was consecrated - this massive house of worship was built in order to fulfill the spiritual needs of the City’s exponentially growing population of Catholics - mostly flooding in from Ireland and Italy. Replacing the older St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral - now called St. Michael’s Russian Catholic Church of the Byzantine Rite - as the main seat of the Diocese of New York, the newer St. Patrick’s Cathedral is a massive, twin-spired Gothic cathedral smack dab in the center of Fifth Avenue, and stands as the seat of the Archbishop of New York. However, this hallowed place lies dormant and wounded, for radicals set it ablaze during the Battle of New York - though it is not known if the perpetrators were Syndicalists extremists, Protestant fanatics, or simply rouge gangsters, though all sides point fingers at others. \n\nLuckily, the cathedral was not reduced to cinders, but its right tower, roof, eastern marble support columns, parts of the Lady Chapel, and some of the precious stained glass windows were all heavily damaged, and the cathedral has sat condemned and closed since while the rest of the City slowly stabilized. With peace returning to our streets, the massive Catholic population of New York City - numbering over a million souls - has loudly demanded that the Cathedral be prepared, and no matter what our views may be on Catholicism, we are in no position to piss off such a massive sector of the population. As such, Mayor [root.getleader] has raised funds for the renovation and repair of the church which is to be headed by the George A. Fuller Company, holding a public gala to entice potential donors while also asking local parishioners for anything they could contribute. In addition to this, the cathedral has been given a small detachment of NYPD officers and volunteers from the Ancient Order of Hibernians to stand guard round the clock to ensure nothing like this ever happens again. This city is the City of the Free, and that includes freedom of religion."

Though our metropolis is massive and sprawling like no other city in the dying Union, it is still just one city, and many feel that such a small state needs centralized governance as opposed to federalism. However, the nature of the 5 Boroughs - the administrative blocks of the City made up of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and Staten Island - may just be the perfect underlying structure to support a reformed federalist system. Supporters of this plan would divide the City into 5 ‘states’ represented by each Borough, while Long Island would be divided along its existing country lines, blurring the lines between Borough, State, and Counties to create a unique federalist and decentralized system all under the Mayor’s Office of NYC. What shall the future of NYC’s administrative and political system be - either one City-State and one New York whole and undivided under a centralized Mayor’s Office, or one ‘City-Nation’ composed of the 5 Boroughs and the counties of Long Island that functions as a microcosm of the wider, failed Union?"

Ever innovating, these major breweries have also begun to make deals with creameries and dairy farms out on Long Island and Upstate in order to secure milk and dairy products needed to produce malts, milkshakes, and other sugary treats in addition to their intoxicating brews. \n\nThis industry having such an explosive revival has led to a boom within the City’s bar-scene as well. The City’s nightlife is alive like never before, with major clubs like the Union Club, the Cotton Club, the Copacabana, and others all being more popular than ever, while smaller bars out in the Boroughs outside Manhattan - such as the quaint Irish pub in the Bronx called An Béal Bocht - have become hotspots practically overnight, growing exponentially popular by selling the new brews of these expanding breweries. These industries, though detested by Prohibition advocates, are beloved by and large by the overwhelming masses of our state, so let the good times roll as New York's veins and soul once again fill with the amber ambrosia all brewed locally here in the Big Apple."

Famed hard cider brewers like Bellwether, Nine Pin, and the newly-opened Angry Orchard all pump out their bittersweet and intoxicating elixirs while apple pies, apple pastries, apple tarts, apple wine, and more are made in droves. Events like these are accompanied commonly by pumpkin-picking patches so that children may prepare for Halloween, and usually offer things like tractor-pulled hay rides, corn mazes, petting zoos, and more.

However, this urban sprawl was divided when the borders of the Civil War were hastily drawn - that is, until now. \n\nNow, New Jersey and New York stand united and strong as they were always meant to be, and though we shall have some roadblocks as we get them acclimated to our regime, we shall soon be ready to dominate the East Coast and beyond as the urban heart of eastern North America."

Though his true identity has yet to be revealed, he has become a beloved, if embarrassing, fixture of the Times Square scene - a busy intersection constantly filled with pedestrians, performers, entertainers, and other attention-seekers - and even has announced an album of his songs and shanties is on its way. Many can’t wait to see what more this Naked Cowboy can do, while others are simply disgusted at his indecency. Whether he does this in protest or simply in jest, it is not known - though in private, it has been said that he is a supporter of Trump’s Reform Party and is a performance artist as opposed to a nutted loon.

Initial reports indicate that the riot was sparked over a young Black boy who fell off his bike, and used water from a Whites-only water fountain to clean his scrapes, ignorant of the rigid color-bar that still dominated the City despite our newly independent state. The boy pleaded innocence and ignorance, but was accosted by a group of belligerent White teens who lambasted the boy for breaking the law before a group of Negro onlookers stepped in to defend the child, causing other White onlookers to join in on the other side as things endlessly escalated. Eventually, fists started flying, with either side accusing the other of swinging first, causing a brawl to break out until shots started to lick off and blood started flowing down Harlem’s streets. What started as a small argument exploded, and within hours, the violence spread until nearly all of Harlem had been enveloped in racial violence as Negroes and other oppressed minorities battled it out with White vigilantes and the NYPD amid miscellaneous looting and other opportunistic crime. \n\nWith these riots and their effects still spreading throughout Harlem and its neighboring neighborhoods, voices across the City have begun to use this flashpoint as a rallying cry against the government, with this event being the catalyst needed to further fuel both the ever rising racial tension within the City as well as the march for Civil Rights and other, more radical political movements. Now, many cry for the City Council to do something to stop the chaos, but with the NYPD already on the scene, there is little that can be done aside from sending in the National Guard which is an option few Mayors wish to have to use.

The Marx Brothers, composed of Jewish-American vaudeville stars Chico, Harpo, and Groucho and their less-stardom loving brothers Gummo and Zeppo, the group are the children of Minnie Marx, herself a vaudeville star and sister to the famous comic Al Shean. They have risen to be some of the most popular and beloved entertainers in all of NYC, and in their newest picture, the group parodies a failing sanitarium which is saved by the wild Hugo Hackenbush - played by Groucho Marx - who is a veterinarian masquerading as a medical doctor in order to save the failing nut house. Filled with laughs, gaffs, stunts, acrobatic, satire, and just downright old fashioned humor, ‘A Day at the Opera’ is sure to be yet another smash success for the Marx Brothers, and despite their alleged Socialist sympathies and Jewish background, these brothers have once again risen to the top of the Big Apple."

With these hands, he has molded NYC into the most varied and modern city on Earth, and he will not stop until NYC’s skyline graces and scrapes the heavens themselves. Despite claims of his racist views, being caught bulldozing minority housing for new developments and purposely designing areas in a way to reduce the viability of public transportation in order to limit the movement of minorities - such as by designing bridges too low to allow buses to travel tinder them - Moses has shaken off each and every attack on his image, and now seeks to build yet another massive skyscraper in the City’s skyline.

Upon arriving in the NYC harbor, the massive ocean liner was unboarded and then seized by the Port Authority of New York City, enraging the Commune of France and their allies in the Internationale, but securing one of the greatest ships ever built for our own fleet. Renamed the USS Lafayette and destined to be refitted into a troop transport, fate had other plans. \n\nOn the morning of February 9th, sparks from a welding torch ignited flammable kapok-filled life vests, spreading flames to the flammable varnished wood and causing the ship to be consumed in a massive inferno. With the ship’s ample fire extinguishing system disconnected during the refits, there was nothing to stop the blaze, and within 15 minutes the entire ship had capsized and sunk into the mud at the bottom of Pier 88.

As such, some within our cabinet have suggested a deal with the devil of sorts. By turning to the Five Families under Lucky Luciano through our liaison Joseph Lanza - the mob moss behind Fulton Fish Market’s backroom dealings - we could perhaps persuade these mobsters to help guard our dockyards to prevent subterfuge and sabotage attempts. In return for turning a blind eye to some of their lesser crimes while also providing a nominal sum of money, these mobsters would work on our payroll as guards and private investigators.

Of course, the New York is only a small part of our totally territory , as the rest of Long Island left the Union along with the City proper. This decision was, it seems, not the most popular outside of the Five Boroughs. While hardly being Federalist sympathizers, those who inhabit Long Island, especially the elite families, such as the Rockefellers and Vanderbilts, have seemingly taken matters into their own hands. Using the chaos and various guerrilla fighters that dot Long Island outside of the City as an excuse, various private militias have been raised, overwhelming bankrolled by the elites. Officially only existing to restore order while the NYPD has their hands full with the city, these militias have indeed begun to restore order, but not the order that flows from Mayor [root.getleader]’s government. These militias establish their own order, their own laws, their own governments in some cases, in clear defiance of the Mayor’s authority.\n\n While not taking a direct stand against the City itself, these militia have begun to activily halt shipments from the rest of the Island to the City itself. With the vast majority of these shipments being food, and with Long Island being the sole place we can grow our own crops, action on the Mayor’s part has been forced. In order to avoid a firefight and risk alighting a civil war within the context of a larger civil war, the Mayor has authorized the NYPD to infiltrate these militias and take them down from the inside, as well as igniting internal conflicts.The plan is, that once the militias are sufficiently whittled down, the NYPD can mop them up and restore true order to Long Island. This plan will take a bit of planning, and is expected to take a few months. In the mean time, rationing has been implemented within the City, in order to avoid starvation as the brave Boys in Blue deal with the siege that has been laid before us."

Thankfully however, these militias have since folded since Mayor Trump's election. Far from wanting to impose the City's culture on them, Trump as done the opposite.  Trump has seemingly been keeping attempts by forces within the City to impose Law within Long Island at bay, electing to empower local authorities instead.\n\nAlong with this decentralizing, Trump has been cutting deals and in some cases actually bankrolling the various Elites that dot Long Island. Be it promises of special tax treatment, a blind eye to 'poor' working conditions or donations to charities that they have links too, Trump has done much to win the Long Island Elites over to his side. Business aside, many of these Elites, the Rockefellers being the largest, are quite supportive of Trump and his Reform Party. In a gesture of friendship, approval of his administration and as a thanks for his support,  Trump has been gifted a large portion of the Deep Hallow Ranch, the oldest cattle ranch in the former United States, which Trump has graciously accepted.

However, despite there being no evidence, all suspect in the City that the man behind these attacks was Charles ‘Lucky’ Luciano - head of the Luciano Crime Family and leading figure within the Commission. Most believe that the gunmen belonged to their enforcer arm Murder, Inc., especially with the victims all being high-profile members of rival outfits including the infamous Big Bill Dwyer - one of the main figures of the Irish Mafia in NYC and one of Luciano's biggest obstacles to securing his hold on the City. \n\nThough there is no evidence to bring Luciano or any of his men in, Police Chief Lewis J.

Led by the likes of John Steinbeck, these mild-mannered Leftists have little in common with our own interpretation of Socialist theory, and yet, they may prove of some use to us. Should we throw them all into cells, or allow them to live private lives in peace?

NYC_flavor.648.d:0 "While holding a speech in Patterson on the glories and triumphs of the Maximist system, Mayor Roosevelt was fired at five times from the crowd as Giuseppe Zangara - an Italian immigrant and laborer noted for living a life of chronic pain and poverty and with apparent mob ties - attempted to assassinate the Mayor. Although all five of his shots from his .32 Caliber US Revolver Company pistol missed Roosevelt, some struck bystanders and innocents during the speech. This resulted in the wounding of five citizens in the crowd as well as the tragic death of Patterson’s Mayor William P. Furrey, but luckily the midget killer Zangara was quickly apprehended afterwards. Soon to be sentenced to life in prison, and with Mayor Furrey being replaced by a new Maximist loyalist, it would seem that all worked out - perhaps too well. \n\nThis assassination attempt is merely the latest in a slew of odd occurrences that have surrounded Mayor Roosevelt since his rise, with each odd occurrence seemingly playing out perfectly in his favor, almost as if someone was pulling the strings from behind the scenes. Another interesting occurrence came just a few weeks ago, when the Mayor swore that there was a secret cabal of Capitalist leaders still active within the Big Apple who were secretly plotting to overthrow his regime with help from the armed forces. Though the evidence for such a claim was scarce, that did not stop the Roosevelt regime from using the opportunity to cleanse City Hall, the National Guard, and our very economy of various influential figures that could have posed a threat to Roosevelt’s ambition. With people like the Vanderbilts, the Rockefellers, the Trumps, and more all being taken down in one fell swoop, Roosevelt was able to secure his grip on total power even more, all the while using a ‘legitimate’ threat to national security as an excuse. Though many doubt the validity of these occurrences, few to none can do anything about it, for with each passing week, Roosevelt only grows more powerful and more untouchable as he climbs to the very top of the City that Never Sleeps."

Everything from fashion and architecture to music, art, and comedy shall be evolved as we speed into our new destiny atop a scarlet bolt of lightning-fast progress. Our native Art Deco designs shall be fused with European ideas of Futurism while also drawing on classical American motifs, creating a new and form-fit identity for this melting-pot metropolis we call home. All shall be one, and all shall be equal and free in this new syncretic and Socialized culture, so let Roosevelt guide us into this new destiny!"

NYC_flavor.650.d:0 "For all their criminal activity, the Mafia under Charles ‘Lucky’ Luciano are a rather nice organization comparatively. While they do crimes of course like extortion and prostitution, he has also been noted for his idea of ‘Mobster Populism’ as well as his enthusiastic philanthropy. Not only that, but he and his men within the Mafia and Murder, Inc. under the Commission know their way around a gun and around a battlefield, especially following the chaos of the Civil War. \n\nAs Mayor Roosevelt puts the Commission under a microscope, many within the Supreme City Council have called for him to just arrest the lot of them, but he sees in Luciano and his men a far grander purpose. Even though he has more than enough evidence to put Luciano and his men away in a dark hole for the rest of their lives, Mayor Roosevelt has instead moved to invite Luciano into the government! Though baffling and even rage-inducing to many, Mayor Roosevelt has pushed forward, stating that Luciano’s established ties to the underground of the City and connections with the people shall be invaluable in instituting his idea of Mobster Populism on a mass scale. Integrating the Commission into the state apparatus as an arm of the Mayor’s office, the rebranded ‘People’s Commission on Public Safety and Wellbeing’ shall be headed by Luciano along with his close associates such as Meyer Lansky and Joe Bonanno, and be tasked with the duty of maintaining the safety and continued function of our new welfare state. With this move, the Mafia will essentially stand as an official arm of the state, acting as civil protection as well as bureaucrats and welfare agents. \n\nHowever, many among the Mob’s numbers are far too violent and resistant to the idea of a government job to be effective civil servants, but our ingenious Mayor along with Lucky Luciano have deduced the perfect plan for what to do with them. They shall serve the state another way - by being drafted into the military! As criminals and violent degenerates, mobsters have ample knowledge about how to use a variety of firearms, more so than the average New Yorker at least. Not only that, but they also know all of the City by heart, including the back alleys and hidey holes that could come in use should the worst come to worse. By rolling its leaders into command positions and their prominent underlings as drill sergeants, we could give our army a real boost while also ridding ourselves of this problematic element of our new allies. Few would be so naive to believe these hardened criminals would turn into law abiding citizens on a dime, but without an organized Mafia menacing the underground, stability should come more naturally to the City as a whole."

With the City’s largest newspaper under his belt, he shall inform the masses of the real, Maximist truth. Furthermore, Mayor Roosevelt has gone on to pack the Supreme Court of New York, increasing the number of justices to 15 while nominating his own Red loyalists to fill the new position. Beyond this, he has also begun to buy up radio stations and even the earliest television stations within the City, broadcasting his ‘fireside chats’ as he sits in front of a massive, ornately ornamented Maximist-themed fireplace of black and white marble trimmed in red and gold discussing his plans for the future each week.

There, the pair fell into various Socialist movements ranging from the Anarcho-Syndicalists to the pious Quakers. However, with our state finally united, the true Roosevelt family has finally been reunited as well. With Anna and Eleanor returning to the Big Apple to finally reconnect with their estranged family, our Mayor has been in a state of constant elation as he is giddy over being reconnected with his lost kin. To celebrate the occasion, the old Roosevelt family estate in Hyde Park, Poughkeepsie - the home of our Mayor’s beloved late father - shall be turned into a family museum, dictating the true history of the Red Roosevelts as dictated by the Mayor.

The lands of the failed and former United States shall be totalized and born anew in a baptism of crimson and red as Maximist National Syndicalism rises to dominate the political stage of this new America. The system that has been proven to work so well in our Big Apple shall now spread to support the entire nation, uplifting the shattered American people towards our new, Socialist Destiny within the Internationale. As one final act to cleanse away the failures of the past however, Mayor - now President - Roosevelt has ordered for all ‘False Roosevelts’ (mainly the kin of Teddy Roosevelt’s branch of the family) to be rounded up by the state and sent to trial before our new President himself. There, these fake family members will have one simple choice: either renounce all old systems and swear to Maximism, or face a wall and meet your maker.

These black sweaters have become increasingly popular within the Big Red Apple, almost to the point that it becomes an odd sight if no one is wearing one in a given local. Given this clear statement of public approval, Mayor [tag.getleader] has begun diverting a small amount of the city's budget to acquire even more of these black sweaters for the public's consumption. While definitely not the most noteworthy thing, advisors to the Mayor assure him that small things like this are a wonderous way to gage public approval, and if this sweater fad is anything to go by, our rule is popular indeed."

A Baptist pastor and politician from Harlem, Powell is the first African-New Yorker to rise to such a height within the confines of non-radical City politics, and as such, he carries much of the Black vote with him. Butting heads with his political rival - the anti-Tammany champion of the conservative Democrats Al Smith - Powell has faced fierce competition on his climb. Though he has a long way to go before he can rally enough support behind him to win any sort of major election, Powell shall fight for what he believes is right as he seeks to transform the once corrupted Democratic Party into a Liberal haven of pious Christians and fair capitalism.

In order to appease the masses while also buying some good publicity along the way, the City Council along with Mayor [root.getleader] has decided that these heroes should be publicly rewarded for their service, pardoned by the State, and given cushy jobs within the bureaucratic hierarchy as compensation.

As such, [root.getleader] has announced that our outfit and all organizations tied to ours shall allow the UHT to act without impunity while we support their efforts from the shadows.

With Syndicalism proven to them to work, it's only natural that the city would join us, a greater Syndicalist power. Opponents to the proposal however are numerous and influential, gathered around former NYC citizens who joined the CSA during the War.

However, amid the rapes and random killings, car jackings and robberies, there exists a tiny group of monsters that truly know no equal. \n\nOne of these base creatures is the Hungarian immigrant Béla Kiss, but perhaps immigrant is not the most fitting term. Kiss has been on the run for decades - a serial killer with few equals responsible for the deaths of at least 23 women and one man, or is it at least 24 women as of today. Long trying to hide away within the hustle and bustle of the City that Never Sleeps, and never pays attention, Kiss tried to sweep his past under a rug, faking his death and immigrating to America before finding work as a janitor at various employers around the City, never staying in one place for too long as to always hide his increasingly infamous face. However it would seem that plan had finally failed once again. \n\nPreparing the large metal drum filled with brine solution and gasoline, Kiss was well underway with his preferred and signature method of body disposal. He had already drained her body of all fluids, sampling them all along the way as he practiced his demented form of vampirism. Lowering the body of his strangled and blood-drained victim into the vat, his hands were occupied when the Police finally burst in. Having picked up local tips from bystanders that recognized his face both at his janitorial job and once when getting off the subway in Manhattan, the local cops were able to track Kiss down to this locale - a small apartment complex in Staten Island. Pointing their M1917s and Browning Hi-Points at him, the officers demanded he drop the girl and put his hands in the air, but as the madman reached for a knife, two of the officers on scene opened fire at Kiss’ lunging frame, striking him three times in the chest and once in the head, finally ending the story of this sadistic freak. \n\nThe victim was identified as a local woman with no family and no close friends or neighbors - his preferred type of prey - and her body has been donated to medical science as a result, along with her killer’s. Detectives familar with the case noted that Kiss had long been demented, having a history of being interesting in the occult, being cheated on and abdoned by one of his two ex-wives, and having an incestuous relationship against his will as a child, which all could have lead to his downfall into perversion. Whatever the circumstances, it would seem that finally, after running from Hungary to Serbia to God knows where else before he landed here, the violent and sadistic odyssey of Béla Kiss has finally come to an end."

While on a routine training flight from Bedford Army Air Field in Massachusetts to Newark Metropolitan Airport in New Jersey, foggy weather and low-visibility conditions caused pilot William Smith Jr. to make an erroneous course-correction towards the right instead of the left after passing the Chrysler Building on his flightpath, putting the bomber and its 3-man crew unknowingly on a direct collision course with the ‘Empty State Building’, as it has been nicknamed since its construction finished, which was obscured from their limited view. \n\nAccording to eyewitness reports, at 9:40am the ‘Old John Feather Merchant’, a B-25 Mitchell bomber, crashed into the Empire State Building - the world’s tallest skyscraper - between the 78th and 80th floors, triggering a minor explosion which thankfully caused no lasting structural damage, but tragically caused a blazing inferno to rage across not only the top floors of the Empire State Building itself, but also down below as fire and embers rained down onto the surround buildings and roads around 5th Avenue and 33rd Street, causing significant damage - even burning down a neighboring penthouse art studio after one of the plane’s engines burst through the tower’s exterior wall and landed on the studio’s roof - while inducing a Borough-wide panic. Although over 50 people were on the observation deck just 6 floors above the impact zone, the death toll was luckily much smaller, eventually leaving 14 dead (3 servicemen including Colonel William Smith Jr., Staff Sergeant Christopher Domitrovich, and Navy Aviation Machinist's Mate Albert Perna, along with 11 civilians who were working in the tower) and an additional 24 wounded while causing roughly a million dollars in property damage to the Empire State Building and the surrounding infrastructure. Additionally, the blaze mutilated the bodies of two of the crewmen beyond recognition, and Perna’s body was not found until 2 days later, mere hours before the building was deemed safe to be re-opened, after it had been discovered his remains were thrown by the blast down an elevator shaft. Miraculously, elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver was thrown from the elevator car on the 80th floor and suffered serious burns, but as paramedics loaded her stretcher onto another unknowingly-damaged elevator to be lowered to the ground during the rescue operation, the fire-frayed elevator cables snapped, causing Oliver to plummet 75 stories, slamming into the ground floor and breaking her pelvis, neck, and back but amazingly surviving, earning her the dubious record of the longest survived elevator fall. \n\nDespite this tragedy, clean-up and repair crews are already on site as the rest of the floors of the tower are reopened for regular use, structural analysis shows no lasting damage to the tower’s support structure, and the victims are all in the process of being prepared for funerary rights. Though the crash could have been avoided if pilot Smith headed the no-visibility warning he was given, this has been a heartbreaking loss nonetheless, and all 14 victims are to be honored by the City as true American patriots. Hopefully we can move on from this horrific day of infamy and work to ensure better safety measures in aeronautic travel going forward, and legislation has already been suggested by many to allow citizens affected by the accident, along with the families of the victims, to sue the government over the crash and future tragedies further caused by governmental negligence."

NYC_flavor.83.d:0 "Not even one full year after the horrific Empire State Building plane crash that claimed the lives of 14 innocents, the Big Apple has been rocked by tragic aeronautical accidents yet again. Enroute to Newark Airport from Lake Charles Army Air Field in Louisiana, a Beechcraft C-45F Expediter plane slammed into 40 Wall Street’s northern facade due to heavy fog obscuring their vision, striking the 58th floor at 8:10pm and creating a 20-by-10-foot hole in the masonry while killing all five crewmen aboard, though luckily no one in the building or on the ground was hurt. The crash also caused damage to the surrounding buildings and streets as the impact splintered the plane, sending the fuselage and one wing out towards the surrounding area and spreading the blaze, though luckily first responders arrived on the scene before the damage to the surrounding area was significant. In response to this accident and the B-25 crash of last year, Mayor [nyc.getleader] has finally announced a full ban on any airplanes attempting to land in New York City airspace during low-visibility conditions. With this new legislation, hopefully our beloved skyline and our haggard people can finally breathe a shared sigh of relief."

NYC_flavor.84.t:0 "Mayor Morris Hillquit, Big Bill Haywood’s Old Rival"
 NYC_flavor.84.d:0 "Rising to the position thanks to Sinclair’s honorable resignation in order to pass the torch to a more veteran and experienced Socialist politician, utilizing his popularity as a vehicle for the Party, Morris Hillquit now stands as the leader of the Leftist movement in New York. A German-Jewish refugee from Riga in the former Russian Empire, Hillquit came to America after his father lost his factory in Riga to settling Russians when Morris was just 15, living in a two-room tenement house before getting a job as a boy and working to help his family, and eventually falling into New York’s growing labor movements. A champion of immigration policies that give international workers the freedom to immigrate to greener pastures, Hillquit supports Internationalism and strong pro-labor policies, but is vehemently against the idea of Syndicalism; instead holding a disbelief in the stability and efficacy of industrial unions, a distaste of strike-oriented tactics as opposed to collective bargaining, a belief in the separation of functions between the political and labor wings of the workers’ movement, and a hatred for the radical propaganda used by Syndicalist organizations, which Hillquit believed alienated much of society from the Socialist cause and further marginalized the left. In the past before the Great War, Big Bill Haywood of the Syndicalist IWW squared off with Hillquit, master of the idea of the ‘Electoral Socialist’ as one of the only Socialists elected to a State congress in America at the time, holding lively public debates like the one at New York’s Cooper Union in 1912, where Haywood suggested Hillquit use ‘a little sabotage in the right place at the proper time’ and slander him as a traitor to the class struggle, while Hillquit rebuked that all of American society would not just change overnight and embrace Syndicalism just because a few industrial radicals screamed about it. Also getting into fights with Nationalist Zionists over his support of a Jewish state and Jewish cultural and spiritual Zionist ideas, but denounces many Zionists using the movement as a front for Jingoistic and Imperialistic aims, Hillquit has made many enemies over his long career, but has proven time and time again, thanks to the democratic mandate of the masses, that his way has worked - at least for him - for decades as he creators his workers’ utopia in our metropolis."

 NYC_flavor.85.d:0 "Rising to the position thanks to Sinclair’s honorable resignation in order to pass the torch to a more veteran and experienced Socialist politician, utilizing his popularity as a vehicle for the Party, Meyer London now stands as the leader of the Leftist movement in New York. The son of a devout Jewish mother and a Talmudic scholar turned agnostic revolutionary father, his family fled the Russian Empire at the end of the 19th Century when he was 20 years old, arriving in New York before studying law and falling into Socialist radicalism like his father before him, famously being the first elected Socialist politician in New York State’s Congress and a powerful enemy to Tammany Hall. \n\nA supporter of Leftist Internationalism and supporting Jewish interests in order to raise them up from the oppressed squalor they live in across America, Meyer London does not favor Jewish people in his policies, but does make sure they are given their fair share as all are under his government. A disciple of Eugene Debs with allies in the Jewish Bund and the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union, he is also a devout feminist, but despite all this, he gets waves of criticism over one position: Zionism. \n\nLondon did not oppose the right of Jews to strive for a separate and distinct national existence fortified by a Jewish state. However, he stated ‘all that I ask of them is that they should not speak in the name of all Jews.’ Further, London believed in the possibility of a specifically socialist Jewish state, so long as it ‘can be accomplished without violating the Socialist principle which forbids forcible annexation.’ This fence-sitting stance to Nationalist Zionism as many saw it enraged many. Although his economic policies have done wonders for our workers’ economy and even with his dedication to Socialist egalitarianism and civil rights is well known and documented, he still gets scrutiny by his fellow Jew for not openly supporting the National Zionist cause. This has put him at odds with many famous Jewish leaders and Zionists like Jacob Schiff, Louis Marshall, Nathat Straus, and Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, and despite all his good works, he will still be called a traitor by many of his people due to his steely commitment to his non-nationalist ideas."

NYC_flavor.86.d:0 "Rising to the position thanks to Sinclair’s honorable resignation in order to pass the torch to a more veteran and experienced Socialist politician, utilizing his popularity as a vehicle for the Party, August Claessens now stands as the leader of the Leftist movement in New York. A Roman Catholic immigrant from Sweden turned to one of New York’s first successful Socialists, Claessens arrived in America in 1890 when he was only 5, growing up in the Big Apple before getting a job at 14 and falling in with the growing labor movements through his study at the Rand School of Social Science, his Yiddish friends that helped radicalize him, and his work connections with the Cooper Union. An academic and a teacher, he is an expert on public speaking, parliamentary procedure, psychology, sociology, race relations, contemporary politics, anthropology, race relations, Socialist theory and praxis, socioeconomics, and sex studies, taking these fields into his work as he supports most movements aimed at freeing humanity framed by common ethics and an understanding in human nature. A member of the Old Guard of New York’s Socialist elite along with Morris Hillquit, Meyer London, James Oneal, and Louis Waldman, Claessesns supports a non-violent and electoral path to true Communism and Leftist Internationalism. Seeking to industrialize and modernize the City and uplift the worker through the mandate of the masses, the Big Apple stands with ‘Good Communist’ as he tries to build a scientific socialist and democratic paradise."

NYC_flavor.87.d:0 "Rising to the position thanks to Sinclair’s honorable resignation in order to pass the torch to a more veteran and experienced Socialist politician, utilizing his popularity as a vehicle for the Party, Vito Marcantonio now stands as the leader of the Leftist movement in New York. The only native New Yorker among the top dogs of the Party, Vito Anthony Marcantonio was born to Italian immigrants in 1902 here in the Italian Ghetto in East Harlem. From this humble beginning, he crawled through the muck under the boot of the notoriously anti-Italian Tammany years, getting himself an education and eventually a Law degree before getting interested in Socialism due to his mentor Joseph R. Brodsky and falling in with the surging labor movement headed by figures like Morris Hillquit and Meyer London. A close friend of progressives like Parley P. Christensen, Robert M. La Follette, and New York’s own Fiorello La Guardia, Mayor Marcantonio has allies all across the Liberal and Left spectrum, granting him great purchase within the political area of New York and wider America. Not just schmoozing with these bigwigs however, his time as a lawyer and in the slums of New York City earned him allies among the downtrodden as well, famously working with Puerto Rican, Black, Jewish, and other minority labor leaders and public figures across the political spectrum in order to always help those in need, no matter what. Sharing the non-nationalist and pro-peaceful Internationalism espoused by his contemporaries and allies in the Party, Marcantonio is always a dedicated Roman Catholic, and though he does not favor one religion over another and still pursues Socialist Secularism, his morals and life outlook are self-admittedly formed by his faith. A dedicated progressive Socialist, Marcantonio’s career may not be as long and storied as the rest of the Old Guards’ but his tenure has shown great promise, and his time as Mayor will surely only continue this shining career as the firebrand lawyer that rose from squalor to champion the cause of New York’s forgotten."

Many of the men wish to go home on both sides, and with the prospect of slaughtering more fellow Americans becoming less appealing by the day, something may have to be done. Some have suggested that we send a peace offer to the enemy, offering peace in exchange for our continued independence as well as control of the lands of New England. However, many believe this to be cowardice, or simply a plan the Americans would never go for. What shall we do?"

newyork_prewar.7.d:0 "With the frontline in New England grinding down into trench warfare as New Yorker guerillas attack us from the forests and swamps or concrete jungles of their home region, the Mayor of NYC has sent a letter to our administration. They have offered full peace between our two nations if we agree to cede New England, Upstate New York, and New Jersey to them. Though this would be a blow to our nation, we still have the rest of the country as our claim, and this would close a costly and draining frontline. With the idea of killing fellow Americans getting less popular among the troops by the day, perhaps we should sign the deal, or is this merely cowardice creeping in?"

These two halves of the Northeast have played tug of war with each other since the times of the 13 Colonies, vying for which culture and identity would be more dominant. Now, finally, we have an opportunity to finally settle this debate. \n\nWith our newfound sovereignty and control over these states, we are in a position to mold the new socioeconomic and cultural future of the Northeast as whole. Though the capital shall undoubtedly stay in New York City, for it is the birthplace of our new nation and the largest City in America by far, the identity of this new nation is still up for debate. We could continue to pursue a policy of New York exceptionalism, for we are the Excelsior State, dragging the rest of the Mid-Atlantic States along with us as we establish New York as a new nation and identity, but that would likely anger the states to the North. Instead, we could decide to come together, all being states of English colonial ancestry, to embrace a cohesive and unified New England identity that would replace any old notion of the word. This new New Englander identity would include all states in our new Union, giving us a unified and equal identity to rally around without excluding any of the states. What shall we decide?"

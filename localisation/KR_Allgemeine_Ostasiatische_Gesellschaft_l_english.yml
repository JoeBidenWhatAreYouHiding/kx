AOG_concessions_desc:0"Following the Qing victory over the Fengtian Government, Germany together with the East China Association sought to take advantage over its now dominant position. As a result of a few major deals with the League of Eight Provinces, Germany was able to carve out a semi-official group of territorial concessions, which was to be known as the Aufsichtsrast der Ostasiatische Generalverwaltung. While allowing for a major German presence within East Asia, it has also had the downside of angering many locals, this making them unwilling to help defend the concessions"

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_AOG_BOARD_DESC:0"The Board of Directors is a council of the largest businesses in the AOG. They meet monthly to discuss the policy of the nation and decide on the future of the Concessions. While legally the board of directors is representative of all companies within the AOG, Krupp has the lines-share of influence, and many believe that the Board of Directors to be a complete front for Alfred Felix Alwyn von Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach’s and his company. And despite its vast influence, the Board of Directors is shrouded in deep secrecy, something representative of its elitist nature; but despite it’s secrecy, the power held by the Board of Directors is immeasurable. Even if the Board acting as head of state is a cover for Krupp’s ambitions."


### Events ###
allgost.1.t:0 "The Burning of the Head-Office"
allgost.1.d:0 "At 21:15 on the night of February 11, 1936, a Guilin fire station received an alarm call that the Head-Office, the assembly location of the Ostchina-Direktorum, was ablaze. A Chinese Nationalist by the name of Lee-Hom Ren was arrested at the scene of the blaze two hours later. There was a warrant out for his arrest, and after three hours of enhanced interrogation he confessed to the arson."
allgost.1.a:0 "This Is A Nationalist Outrage!"

allgost.2.t:0 "The New Head-Office"
allgost.2.d:0 "The former head office of the Commissioner is now a smouldering rubble. The man who was responsible was hung but it does not solve the question of where the Ostchina-Direktorum will hold their meetings."
allgost.2.a:0 "Rebuild the New Head-Office right where the former one stood"
allgost.2.b:0 "Guangzhou, the Industrial capital of Southern China"
allgost.2.c:0 "Nantong, The Agricultural Capital of Southern China"

allgost.3.t:0 "German Factories Shut Down"
allgost.3.d:0 "All German-owned factories in China have shut down in reaction to our refusal to hand over Nantong to the Legation Cities."
allgost.3.a:0 "They've made a grave error..."
allgost.3.b:0 "NO! We cannot let this happen! Buy them now!"

allgost.4.t:0 "The Reactionary Reforms"
allgost.4.d:0 "Since the Burning of the Head-Office, the Board realises a change in policy is required if its going to improve its fiscal outlook and keep Nationalist sentiments in Southern and Central China under control. We have just begun to feel the effects of the Berlin Stock Market Crash or 'Black Monday' as its being called, and we have to resolve the problems it presents and plan for the future of this company. The result of the meeting is..."
allgost.4.a:0 "We cannot afford to continue 'Iron Rice Bowl' practices"
allgost.4.b:0 "Begin to work closer with the Elites and recognise the Native Structure"
allgost.4.c:0 "Close the Qing operated factories that are draining our profits"
allgost.4.e:0 "The economy is just in a slump, we can wait it out"

allgost.5.t:0 "The German Factories"
allgost.5.d:0 "The scoundrel Ostchina-Direktorum of the AOG has decided to close the factories inside our borders to 'maximise their profits.'"
allgost.5.a:0 "Let them go"
allgost.5.b:0 "NO! We cannot let this happen! Buy them now!"

allgost.19.t:0 "The Labour Force of Southern China"
allgost.19.d:0 "After we stopped guaranteeing job security, 'Iron Rice Bowl' jobs as the Chinese call it, to the Chinese people the workers have begun to do more worrying than working. Almost overnight, fully one third of Southern China's workforce was unemployed. A large majority of these people became migratory workers, moving from job to job in great masses. There have been attempts to unionise in the more urbanised areas, and the Unionists were made an example of."
allgost.19.a:0 "We've made a mistake, re-instate job security"
allgost.19.b:0 "There is unemployment, but have you seen the profits!?"

allgost.6.t:0 "The Labour Riots of Changsha and Nanchang"
allgost.6.d:0 "As unemployment in the Northern and Southern areas continued to climb, dissent began to climb with them. Disturbing news comes from the Changsha and Nanchang regions as riots broke out in the two industrial cities as well as smaller riots all over the company. The only region where there have been no reported riots is the coastline as the fishing and shipping industries remain unaffected."
allgost.6.a:0 "Riots are like forest fires, best to just stand back and let them burn"
allgost.6.b:0 "If we let them continue, who knows what next!"

allgost.7.t:0 "The Status of the Reforms"
allgost.7.d:0 "The meeting of the Ostchina-Direktorum was held today. At the last conference, the decision to begin downsizing was made by the Board. They are expected to make a decision whether to continue downsizing or not."
allgost.7.b:0 "We have made enough progress with our compromise, we met our goals"
allgost.7.c:0 "Abandon the reforms, we're getting in too deep!"

allgost.8.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the A.O.G.!"
allgost.8.d:0 "As the German Economy collapses, it appears that we have weathered the Black Monday crisis no better than our German Overlords it would seem, with German businesses, already facing pressure from local elements, being hit particularly hard. The Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, once thought too big to fail, is teetering on the edge of collapse, and the trickleback effects of this financial instability are already being felt by our own financial sector."
allgost.8.a:0 "Oh Dear..."

allgost.9.t:0 "Major Companies Filing for Bankruptcy"
allgost.9.d:0 "With the Economy collapsing, major companies such as Krupp and Hapag-Lloyd have begun to go under. A Bailout is one of the few things that could keep these companies from going bankrupt, but this is very costly and our nation may not be able to afford it at the moment. "
allgost.9.a:0 "We Can't afford it Now!"
allgost.9.b:0 "Bail them Out!"

allgost.10.t:0 "Major Companies Filing for Bankruptcy"
allgost.10.d:0 "With a refusal of a government bailout, many smaller companies within our sphere have gone completely bankrupt. The Largest of these companies that have filed for bankruptcy is the East-Asian Branch of the Bayer AG Chemical Company. As an alarming pattern of bankruptcy continues, many fears that the large conglomerates such as Krupp and Hapag-Lloyd could also go under. If that happens, our economy could be very well doomed. "
allgost.10.a:0 "Not yet..."
allgost.10.b:0 "We can't let those companies fail"

allgost.11.t:0 "The Kaiser Replaces the Government"
allgost.11.d:0 "With the imminent collapse of the Economy, Krupp and the other failing companies were required to take action. This action came in the form of a meeting between Alfred Felix Alwyn von Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach and the Kaiser. This emergency meeting convinced the Kaiser that Commissioner von Falkenhausen was unable to manage the AOG, and thus new leadership is needed. Under a new government, Krupp will run the government from the shadows while the AOG’s board of directors take control of the AOG publicly. This board of directors has Krupp as it’s main benefactor, while smaller companies within the AOG have minor influence. As of now, von Falkenhausen has not made any public statement and has instead retuned to the Military full-time. "
allgost.11.a:0 "The Ostchina-Direktorum is fading.."

allgost.12.t:0 "Government Bailout of Major Companies"
allgost.12.d:0 "Seeing that major companies are on the verge of collapse, Director von Falkenhausen has approved a temporary bailout for Major companies such as Krupp. Though Krupp has not completely recovered, the company has been saved from bankruptcy. Many within the government say that this bailout is not enough, but on our current budget it is the best that we can do. "
allgost.12.a:0 "Let's hope it helps.."

allgost.13.t:0 "The AOG Demands Submission"
allgost.13.d:0 "Recently, the AOG has demanded full submission. They have demanded that the commissions be abolished, and instead the entirety of Nanking’s Wealth will be taken directly by the AOG. This will lead to nothing short of the dissolution of our nation, but we don’t really have any other options. "
allgost.13.a:0 "Fight the German Bastards!"
allgost.13.b:0 "We have no choice but to submit..."

allgost.14.t:0 "A New Agreement with the AOG"
allgost.14.d:0 "The AOG has proposed a new agreement between our nations. If this agreement were to go through, they would have almost complete control of our nation, but we would gain a hefty profit. "
allgost.14.a:0 "No!"
allgost.14.b:0 "It's just good Buisness..."

allgost.15.t:0 "The AOG Demands Submission"
allgost.15.d:0 "Recently, the AOG has demanded full submission. They have demanded that the commissions be abolished, and instead the entirety of Peking’s Wealth will be taken directly by the AOG. This will lead to nothing short of the dissolution of our nation, but we don’t really have any other options."
allgost.15.a:0 "Fight the German Bastards!"
allgost.15.b:0 "We have no choice but to submit..."

allgost.16.t:0 "Our influence in China Grows..."
allgost.16.d:0 "Amidst a season of mixed news, it appears that we have managed to come across a stroke of good fortune. The completion and purchase of the Zhegan railway, a large-scale rail project inside the League of Eight Provinces, has allowed us to spread our influence deeper into Chinese territory. While some responses to the AOG's actions have been less than pleasant, we can safely assume that this is a sign of good things to come."
allgost.16.a:0 "Good to hear."

allgost.17.t:0 "Ostasien and The A.O.G."
allgost.17.d:0 "As the primary centre of German influence in Asia, the work of the Ostasien administration often crosses paths with that of the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatische Generalverwaltung, or AOG. While we retain direct control of Guangzhou and Tsingtau, through the AOG, an administrative body operating inside the League of Eight Provinces, we are able to indirectly profit from several key coastal concession cities, alongside various German-owned infrastructure and industries further inland. The AOG does not answer to Ostasien, nor we to them; nevertheless it is in both of our direct interests to support and protect each other where we are able."
allgost.17.a:0 "Cooperation is key."

allgost.18.t:0 "A Chinese Kaiserreich?"
allgost.18.d:0 "With the triumphant rise of German influence in China through their intermediary in the AOG, these Europeans have wrested total control of the nation and its peoples. As more and more Chinese citizens are entangled into the German sphere, the dominance of the Kaiserreich has only grown more apparent, and as a result more of our citizens see the Germans as the legitimate governing force in our borders over all others. Many within our administration have now begun to push this situation to what they consider its natural conclusion: the formal declaration of a German kingdom in China. Though most find this idea absolutely preposterous, with our dominance and power it would be hard for anyone to stop us. The choice shall be left up to our administration and the Kaiser himself to decide."
allgost.18.a:0 "Don’t be ridiculous! The Chinese people would never accept a foreign monarch."
allgost.18.b:0 "Perhaps even these distant lands can bear witness to our Kaiser’s grace."
allgost.18.c:0 "Let us keep Puyi atop his throne."
allgost.18.e:0 "Yuan Keding shall be a fine representitive of our stewardship."
allgost.18.f:0 "Let the Qing survive, Puyi can be replaced with someone more cooperative."

allgost.20.t:0 "A New Face Sits Atop the Dragon Throne"
allgost.20.d:0 "Deep within the hallowed and ancient halls of the Forbidden City, a lavish and majestic ceremony is being held. As the fiery sun rises in the East, so too does a new leader rise for these Eastern lands to bear witness to. China now lies as a domain of the Kaiserreich, and as such, Kaiser Wilhelm has personally seized the Mandate of Heaven, meaning he alone bears the divine right to rule these lands. With his coronation ceremony, Kaiser [GER.getleader] shall take on the additional title as Weilian, Emperor of the Chinesisches Kaiserreich! He shall take the regal dynastic name of ‘Wǔ Dé’, as is tradition for his new role due to the different naming conventions of the Far-Eastern dynasty. Long may he reign as the sovereign of these foreign lands and may his rule usher in an era of true peace and prosperity for the Chinese people."
allgost.20.a:0 "Wilhelm Hohenzollern has seized the Mandate of Heaven!"
allgost.20.b:0 "Wilhelm Hohenzollern has seized the Mandate of Heaven!"

allgost.21.t:0 "The Chinese Triumph"
allgost.21.d:0 "Since we began our war with the Chinese, our foothold in the region has been completely destroyed, many cry out for the German government to end this lost cause of a war and bring our boys home before more German lives are wasted grasping at lost glories."
allgost.21.a:0 "We must fight on!"
allgost.21.b:0 "We cannot afford it"

allgost.22.t:0 "The Dragon Throne"
allgost.22.d.puyi:0 "The AOG has settled on establishing Puyi as a figurehead for the newly reformed Chinese Empire due in large part to his willingness to work with us. Upon hearing of the request for him to return to the Dragon Throne, Puyi reportedly "went wild with joy", perhaps misinterpreting how important his position really is. While formally being head of state of the newly unified country, our government will ensure he has minimal influence in the daily functions of the state to make certain that German control doesn't fade any time soon."
allgost.22.d.keding:0 "With the tense discussions regarding the future leadership of German China finally over, the stage is set for the coronation of the new Emperor Yuan Keding. A decadent ceremony funded by Berlin and the AOG's increasingly large coffers has seen the son of Yuan Shikai restored to his rightful throne, with Keding taking his father's title as the Hongxian Emperor in honor of his bloodline. Despite the heavy German guidance in government, having a true monarch restored to the Chinese throne will unify our formerly divided subjects. As the new Han ruler takes the mostly ceremonial reigns of the Chinese monarchy, a new age of strength and prosperity has surely dawned in the Empire. Long live the Hongxian Emperor!."
allgost.22.d.pujie:0 "Following our brave conquest of the distant Chinese lands and the capture of the thousand-year-old capital Beijing, and after much deliberation, it was finally decided by the AOG and the German government to place Pujie, brother of the previous Emperor Puyi, as the nominal figurehead of a reformed Chinese Empire loyal to German interests, in order to use his Mandate of Heaven to legitimize even stronger German control of these lands.\n Pujie has accepted Germany's offer and seems happy to work with us, no doubt overestimating the powers of such a position, as Germany has ensured that Pujie has only a very limited role in the governance of his country.\n A sumptuous ceremony took place in Beijing, largely financed by Berlin, where Pujie officially became the Emperor of the vast China, he could take advantage of the occasion to interact with his cheering subjects. However, some people noticed the presence of the German Foreign Minister at the ceremony, a symbol of German domination over the country and its wealth."
allgost.22.a:0 "Long live the Son of Heaven!"
allgost.22.b:0 "Long live the Son of Heaven!"
allgost.22.c:0 "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

aogdeathevent.1.t:0 "Kaiser Wilhelm III Takes the Throne"
aogdeathevent.1.d:0 "With the death of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Kaiser Wilhelm III has taken the throne. The coronation has taken place, and the new Chinese Emperor is now Weilian II. Cheers from the coronation members erupted, and the Kaiser of Germany has only tightened the bond with the Chinesisches Kaiserreich."
aogdeathevent.1.a:0 "Hail to thee in the victor's wreath!"

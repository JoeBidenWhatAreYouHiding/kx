KR_SCENARIO_NAME:0 "Legacy of the Weltkrieg"
KR_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "The year of 1936 is a turning point for the history of the world; it is a time of both great opportunity and great danger. Tensions between the German Empire and the Commune of France are growing, Russia and the USA are increasingly unstable and the old empires of Austria and the Ottomans are dissolving. All the while Syndicalism, Totalism and Radical Socialism are spreading all around the world. Fifteen years have passed since the end of the Weltkrieg, and the old rivalries of yore have reappeared. A single spark may be all it takes to light the powder keg..."

### Majors ###

### Germany ###
GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1919, after five years of war, the German army finally overran the Entente defences in France. In 1921, Britain's surrender followed. The Weltkrieg has made Germany an uncontested World Power, yet things have been going downhill for her since the 1930s. A recessive world economy has dampened the nation's industrial output while other nations' manufacturing power recovers, and now nationalism grows in Germany's eastern client states, who are starting to drift away from the Reich. In 1936, Germany stands at a crossroads, and already we can see cracks in her mighty empire, as her ancestral enemies are regaining their former strength..."

### Commune of France ###
FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 3rd Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Revolution at home. In 1919, a General Strike was called by the CGT, causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. For 15 years, the new 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndico-Socialist consensus, headed by the Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936 the need to rebuild the country and defend the revolution is believed to be outdated by many critics and there is a growing call for more radical policies. France is confident in her mission, but it is unclear which revolutionary strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

### Union of Britain ###
ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After 1921's 'Peace with Honour' ended the Weltkrieg, the faith and support of the people in the Home Islands had disappeared. In 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute quickly escalated into a General Strike called by the TUC, followed by military desertions to the strikers. After six weeks of rioting on a massive scale, the Royal Family and most of the country's elites were evacuated to Canada and instead, a new Congress of Trade Unions assumed political authority. The British people are currently content to build socialism in isolation, yet many are starting to think that the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."

### Canada ###
CAN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Revolution of 1925, the Royal Family and other British exiles found refuge in Canada. With the support of the Conservatives, they established a semi-official government in exile, in hopes of one day reclaiming the Home Islands. All is not well, however. Canadians are growing weary of the British presence, and in 1931 the Conservative government fell to Mackenzie King's Liberals - who now hold a slim majority and see to assert greater Canadian sovereignty in the face of mounting pressure to prepare for the inevitable confrontation between the Entente and the Third Internationale."

### Russia ###
RUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During Russia's Civil War, the White forces fought with all they had, but the Red Army still dominated the country's industrial heartland. The German Empire, however, fearing a red Russia, decided to intervene on behalf of the Whites. Two years later, Moscow and Petrograd fell to the White forces, and a new Russian Republic was established. For the past fifteen years, the leading parties, S-R and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerenskiy, but Russia is becoming increasingly unstable. Other political forces are growing, and they are considering that it is now time for change, so that the country may reassert her power in the world..."

### United States ###
USA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States is in the midst of its worst political turbulence since 1865. Few expected this after America successfully avoided the Weltkrieg but the rise of syndicalism fomented a Red Scare and an economy depressed by nonstop worker strikes and political crackdowns. Herbert Hoover won the 1928 election promising a return to normalcy but with the Great Panic of 1928 occurring he has made no headway and his re-election via the House of Representatives has only damaged his legitimacy. Now US politics is challenged by numerous radical forces, all of whom promise in their own way an end to politics as we know it if elected."

### Japan ###
JAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While the 'Peace with Honour' guaranteed Japanese rule over the colonies, not all was well in the Empire of the Rising Sun. After a period of economic upheaval culminated in a Syndicalist attempt on the life of Prince-Regent Hirohito in 1926, unstable governments followed one another in a year of crisis; First General Tanaka, then the democratic Coalition Cabinet and an intervention in north-east China. In 1936, Japan is poised to extend her empire. With Germany's dominance appearing to be in decline, the Japanese look hungrily at the remaining Qing territories and the German Pacific possessions..."

### Other ###
OTHER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are waiting for their turn to rise as a major player of this world. From major powers trying to keep their empires to the many nations trying to regain what they lost in the Weltkrieg, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world..."

### Featured ###

### Two Sicilies ###
SIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies initially sided with Austria during the civil war, a necessary evil to halt the advance of the Socialist Republic. Later, however, when war with the syndicalists seemed inevitable, the Austrians showed their true colours and abandoned the south. The war never happened, but the Sicilains came into the modern era wiser. They will have a difficult time meeting the more industrialized north head on, but that war will someday came and they must be ready for it."

### Papal State ###
PAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the formation of a united Italy, it had seemed the time for the Papal States to have secular power was a thing of the past. Then came the collapse of the kingdom, and the civil war which followed, and central Italians once again turned to the Papacy and its Sicilian allies to help maintain stability. Now Pope Pius XI is ill, and on his deathbed he laments an Italy that remains divided, with the syndicalists growing ever stronger in the north. Whoever his successor is, he will need God on his side in order to prevail."

### Greece ###
GRE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The years since Greece's loss in the Weltkrieg have seen little but upheaval and hardship. The loss of Crete and Macedonia to the Treaty of Salonika and crippling war debts to Austria and Germany sent King Alexander fleeing into exile as the Third Republic was declared... only to result in years of failed governments and coups until Georgios Kondylis took control in 1926 and declared himself the permanent Regent of Greece; its king still in exile. Republicans, Monarchists, and Syndicalists all vie in the shadows. Yet, for the moment, Greece remains in the iron grip of the Thunderbolt General."

### Georgia ###
GEO_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Georgian state was formally established in 1918 after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The ruling Menshevik party banded together with several Bolshevik figures to form a new brand of Socialism. However, with the integration and subsequent rise of several previously Bolshevik figures, such as Leventi Beria and Ioseb Jughashvili, the Menshevik party was quick to radicalise, as the 'Internal Security Service' became more involved in Politics. Only time will tell if Georgian Democracy can survive, or if the Supreme Economic Council will take over the State..."

### AOG ###
AOG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung, or Supervisory Board of the East Asian General Administration, is a collection of semi-official semi-legal coastal concessions under the watch of Germany. The Strong Links between us and The Nanjing Warlord Sun Chuanfang have grown stronger, his League of Eight Provinces accepted a series of exploitative arms deals in return for extensive economic concessions within their nation. the AOG spreads its influence throughout the League and ever deeper into the country's interior. Ultimately though, Berlin would like us to use China as a buffer of sorts against Japan..."
PAN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1931, following accusations of government corruption and inability to handle the economic depression, the public rose up, led by Acción Comunal, a nationalist movement, and appointed Harmodio Arias Madrid and his National Revolutionary Party, formed from Acción Comunal itself, as leader of the Provisional Government. One year later, they held elections and the Madrid-led NRP won easily. Immediately, Madrid's government began to stimulate the economy with public work programs, improving economic conditions and creating jobs. However, despite the economic stimulation, the Panamanian economy is still struggling. The next elections are scheduled for April of 1936, four years after the first election, with economic recovery on the minds of both the parties and voters."

### Illyria ###
CRO_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The Triune Kingdom of Illyria was proclaimed after the Crisis in Austro-Hungary and German Intervention in 1922. The creation of Illyria was proposed by loyal elites, who promised to be loyal to the Kaiser, but claimed more autonomy and the end of the Hungarian rule over Croatia. Though the Triune Kingdom should have become a home for the Catholic Croats, Orthodox Serbs and Muslim Bosniaks, in fact there are a lot of controversies between these nations. The Serbs want to reunite with their Serbian Motherland, the Bosniaks want to get more independence, and the Croats, who have a majority in the country, want to strengthen their position."

### Sardinia ###
SRD_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The House of Savoy was shattered by Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, and King Victor Emmanuel III held responsible. All is not completely lost for the monarchy, however. The Savoy-Aostas are powerful supporters, the rightful holders of Sardinia-Piedmont until their lands on the shores were swallowed up by the syndicalists. Now they and what monarchy supporters they can gather hold out on Sardinia, protected by the French Republic and ready to watch for the opportunity where they, too, can one day return home to claim their seat of power."

#### Mexico ###
MEX_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico’s history is long, rich, and exceedingly diverse, but has been plagued by one main invariable and nearly unending reality - War. This atmosphere of conflict ended with the rise of Porfirio Díaz. Like all dictators though, he wasn’t eternal and was deposed in 1911, although a failed coup in 1913 led to a Civil War, between the the Populists, the Constitutionalists and the Porfirists. In 1920, the Constitutionalists and Populists would end the civil war. In 1932, Zapata would be elected, thus birthing the Alianza Antisocialista and the Liga Democrática. If Mexico is finally able to escape it's bloody history or if she once again falls into another bloody quagmire remains to be seen."
#### Nicaragua ###
NIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The occupation of Nicaragua by the United States Marines in 1926 ended in disaster as the liberal revolutionary general expelled them and set up his new 'Revolutionary Republic' within Nicaragua. It soon drifted towards a socialist attitude and underwent not insignificant development but it is not without its troubles. The expelling of large amounts of American companies has left a hole in the economy and the entire eastern side of the country is unofficially demilitarized after a stern warning of entering the region from the Americans. With the elections soon will Nicaragua's fate finally be changed?"

#### Austria ###
AUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Austria was devastated at the end of the Weltkrieg. Battered by Russian forces and held down by Italians, Austria-Hungary entered a large, steep slope of decline. Over time, a National Populist political party known as the Vaterlandisches Front. The VF held radical ideas, but Austria's worsening situation meant that the VF only kept getting more popular. Now, in 1936, the ruling party CS squares off against the Social Democrat SDAP and the aforementioned VF. Talk is buzzing about the banning of the VF from the elections. Austria will have a difficult few years ahead, but it must go through bad times to get to good times."

#### Legation Cities ###
LEC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Formed under the shadow of a possible German-Japanese war by American mediation, the Legation Cities, is emblematic of both the failure of China to successfully resist foreign imperialism and the push for the "Open Door" policy. At the beating heart of it all lies Shanghai, a diamond plucked from the hands of China and polished to a mirror shine. The Paris of the East is in its heyday, the streets hum with electricity, the opium dens curl with mysterious smoke and the westerners spend money like it is going out of fashion. Under the golden surface of Shanghai lies a terrifying underbelly of murder, intrigue and revolution."

#### Mongolia ####

MON_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Currently under the leadership of Khan Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the Mongolian Khanate has seen little of interest in the past twenty years. Seizing land off the dying Russian Empire, the Khanate suffers from what Mongolia always has suffered under: low industry, and low density. There is always hope, though, and factories are being built at an increasing rate in Mongolia.\nSome say the Khan has great ambitions for Mongolia... perhaps too large ambitions."

##WHR
WHR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "On the 9th of March 1918 Russian troops abandoned Belarus after the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In the immediate aftermath the All-Belarusian Congress declared the formation of the Belarusian People's Republic catching even Germany by surprise. At first the Germans did not recognize the new state, having intended to use Belarus as a bargaining chip with the Bolsheviks. However after the German Intervention in Russia, an independent White Ruthenian state was recognized by Germany - under the condition that the Rada reform the state into a Prussian-style semi-constitutional monarchy."
### Haiti ###
HAI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Haiti has long been subject to the whims of foreign whims and imperialist greed, the nation itself born in the fires of colonialism during the Age of Discovery. Languishing under Spanish explorers, French slave drivers, and most recently, American Marines and businessmen, the people of Haiti have experienced more of their history under the boot of oppression than not. Haiti now stands at the edge of its destiny, and all that it requires now, is a push in the right direction..."
URK_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Ukraine proclaimed its independence with German support on 25th January 1918, a state of affairs that was quickly ratified by the Peace of Nations agreement at Brest-Litovsk. An initial experiment with socialism in the form of a People's Republic was swiftly expunged by a German-backed coup. This operation, led by the strongman and former general in the Russian army Pavlo Skoropadsky, set the tone for Ukraine's future. It was to be a breadbasket used by a military-aristocrat elite from across Eastern Europe as a source of food, a convenient market for goods and a military bulwark against the weakened Russian Republic."
#### Hungary ####

HUN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Before 1914 the Kingdom of Hungary regarded itself as a Great Power in its own right, as it constituted one half of the powerful Habsburg Dual-Monarchy. Victory in the Weltkrieg bought the Kingdom territorial gains at the expense of Serbia and Romania, but not the dominant position in the East that the Hungarians expected. The upcoming Ausgleich negotiation should be the time when the whole of the Crownlands of St. Stephen will finally be restored to the Magyar nation. Meanwhille, a new strain of aggressive and expansionist nationalism has come to the fore of Hungarian politics, many of whom question the continued dominion of the Habsburg Emperor."

#### National France ####

NFA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the French Revolution of 1919, the discredited parliamentary government, having evacuated to Algiers, was rapidly toppled by Ferdinand Foch, who consolidated his military junta until his death in 1929. His successor, Philippe Pétain, has so far taken a more conciliatory attitude to the forces of democracy, reconciling with liberal-conservatives and delegating some power to the Assembly. However, Pétain's simultaneous ties to the deeply Catholic and nationalist Croix-de-Feu, and increasing discontent with parliamentary power within the military, is sure to cause trouble as the National French prepare to take back their homeland..."

#### Bulgaria ####

BUL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the end of the Weltkrieg, the Tsardom of Bulgaria had emerged victorious and had suddenly found herself in a golden age with the successful establishment of a Bulgarian hegemony over the Balkans. With its former enemies defeated, the Tsar's popularity regained, and Bulgaria at its high in centuries, there has been little to worry about - until now. With Austria leaving the Serbian borders, and Romania and Greece beginning rearmament - it only seems likely that Bulgaria will have to walk the way of war once more soon..."

#### Poland ####

POL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Centuries of being divided between Russia, Austria, and Germany; the Polish state would finally be reborn after the defeat of the Russian Empire. Though reduced to less than half of it's former size, and left practically as a puppet of Germany, the new Kingdom of Poland has been increasingly unstable. With many different factions vying for control such as nationalists, republicans or socialists. However there are some who would even go so far as to revive the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in an attempt to revive Polish hegemony over Europe..."

#### Ottomans ####

OTT_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Sick Man of Europe, also known as the Ottoman Empire, is teetering on the brink of dissolution and collapse - numerous peoples vying for their own nations, nearby enemies, and few allies. The Empire suspects the onslaught of war to soon arrive to it, in the form of Egyptians and Persians, along with whoever emerges victorious in the approaching war in Arabia... The Empire can only hope for its subjects to stay loyal to it. German ties, meanwhile, have remained somewhat close, and some statesmen of the Empire have been discussing another German military mission to the struggling Empire..."

#### Transamur ####

TRM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Formed out of the ashes of Admiral Kolchak's Putsch, the Far Eastern Republic of Transamur has been reduced to little more than a Japanese puppet state, and having to deal with opposition from throughout the Far East. Although, Transamur still claims and intends to take back Moscow and Petrograd. What is yet to be decided is the government it will do so as..."

### Italian Federation ###

ITA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the fall of Rome, an exhausted Italy begrudingly accepted the offer of peace with it's former allies, which formed a new Federation of Italian states, however this decision would just begin years of civil war in Italy. Just one year after the announcement, a coalition of Nationalist and Socialist politicians declared a republic in Torino, which would later escape to the south. Now, the Italian Federation is led by Pius XI, although his health is decaying fast, and if he dies the Federation could be torn into chaos. Although one thing is for sure, the Italian Peninsula cannot stay divided for long..."

### Socialist Republic of Italy ###

SRI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Republic of Italy was formed after the fall of Rome, and was originally led by a coalition of Nationalists, Socialists and Moderates; in an attempt to defeat the Austrians and their puppet government. The republic would begin a successful campaign throughout northern Italy until they met fierce resistance by the Austrians at Milan, beginning to push the republic out of the north. After the fall of Torino, the Republican leadership managed to escape to the South and established a powerbase there. Now, Chairman Di Vittorio is struggling to his control of the republic, whilst there also lurks some radicals who are attempting a plot against the Socialists..."

### Liberia ###

LIB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "At approximately the size of Virginia, Liberia is an independent African nation under the protection of the USA. The upper crust of society belongs to a solid voting bloc called the True Whig Party, which has won everyelection since 1870. Secret Societies such as the native Poro or the Masonic Order ensure that the government is torn internally while the population is left to govern themselves. Engulfed by debt from failed projects, the economy in hands of Firestone, and a president assailed by controversy over slavery, her future is more uncertain than ever before. Will President King be able to save Liberia from disaster, or will the demons finally tear the nation, throwing Liberia into chaos?"

## Congo
COG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever Since ‘Belgium’s’ loss in the Weltkrieg, their nation and empire have been subservient to the Kaiser’s will. With this new reality in place, the newly-minted Flandro-Wallonians were allowed to keep their colonial regime within the Congo intact, with heavy concessions to Germany. Over the years since the Weltkrieg, German influence has increasingly weathered the foundations of this regime, and the current Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans has let the situation spiral out of hand. With traditionalist insurrectionists waging a guerilla war, with natives campaigning for independence, and religious fanatics and rogue mercenaries gnawing at her roots, the Vrijstaat’s current situation is dubious to say the least."

## Afghanistan
AFG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While Afghanistan is labeled as a 'victor' of the Weltkrieg, she has not enjoyed the fruits of her labor completely. While concessions were granted by the British with the Second Treaty of Rawalpindi, all is not well in the Graveyard of Empires. Beset on all sides by reactionaries, radicals, and family alike, Emir Habibullah balances on a tight rope, for no one is truly content in the nation. The Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, a German attache that was meant to return to Berlin in 1919, has remained in the nation to this day, and many label the Emir as nothing but a German puppet. With vultures and jackals vying for rule in the unstable nation, Habibullah knows there is only one route forward to possibly preserve his rule: war. "

## Burma
BRM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 1925 British Revolution unavoidably caused the downfall of its once mighty colonial empire. While India proper soon cemented into three separate nation states, the status of Burma was long unclear the became region a chaotic patchwork of territories resembling near-warlordism. Ded up with the unstable situation, German mediation brought an end to the hostilities. The resulting treaty awarded parts of eastern and northern Burma to Siam, and left the rest of the country under a restored Konbaung dynasty. In the years since, the Queen has struggled to cement her rule against a radical and politically demanding populace. All the while, Red India waits for an opportunity to spread the revolution. When the day comes, will Burma be ready?"

### Patagonian Workers Front ###
FOP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the belief that a revolution in the arid wastes of Patagonia would be impossible, the Frente Obrero Patagonico has managed to endure against all odds. Thanks to an opportune Chilean intervention forcing Argentina to accept the new status quo or face a war unprepared at a time of great economic hardship, the FOP has managed to grow in numbers, drawing people disillusioned with the old regime in Argentina. However, the ties that bind the different factions in the FOP are thinner than they look from afar, and perhaps victory in the civil war will only be the match that will set off the powder-keg..."

#### Costa Rica ###
COS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Class warfare, rapid militarisation and the Iron Grip of the Kaiser hold the world in its grasp, which makes it even more peculiar that in the midst of all this violence and pain we can find the tiny republic of Costa Rica. Taking great pride in their impressive literacy statistics and their unbreakable dedication to the Constitution, the nation stands as a rock above its neighbours who have long been eyeing its land. As their greatest ally starts to descend into chaos, vultures all across the Americas are waiting for the proud eagle to fall. Diplomacy will have to prevail if we are to survive the coming tide..."
#
#### Cuba ###
CUB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere seven years since the overthrow of American-backed dictator Gerardo Machado, Cuba again teeters on the edge of political upheaval. The regime of young President Rafael Trejo has steadily lost control over the Army and the civilian government's political authority has all but completely eroded. As radicals both right and left threaten the country, the military may well take full control as soon as an opportunity presents itself."
#
#### Denmark ###
DEN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark exists under the shadow of Berlin. Its relation with the new hegemon of the world is ancient, has often been hostile, even as recently as 1864, which resulted in the loss of Slesvig to the Germans. Yet, in 1936, ties are warm and Denmark, by grace of having remained neutral in the Weltkrieg maintains its sovereignty in full. Under the guiding hand of the popular social democratic prime minister Thorvald Stauning, Denmark has been profiting off German economic prosperity. Domestically, the future looks bright, but internationally, clouds are gathering. Some fear Denmark will be in the wrong place at the wrong time..."
#
#### Dominican Republic ###
DOM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The American Occupation of the Dominican Republic ended in 1924 and full political control was returned soon after, but within a mere few years, the nation's new democratic constitution would face challenges both within and without. While Democracy has so far survived in the nation, the schism of the long-ruling Red Party has again put the constitution's survival in jeopardy."
#
#### Fengtian Government ###
FNG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Shanghai Conference of 1928 left Fengtian as the sole inheritor of the old Beiyang Republic's legacy. As before, democracy is maintained only as a thin veneer, and real power is divided between a wide variety of unscrupulous autocrats.\n\nZhang Zuolin, his ambitions limited by the stark realities of Qing strength and Japanese power, has been forced to walk a political tightrope above the machinations of his own divided government. The outlook is grim, but some still hold out hope. The Five Colour Flag may again flutter high above Beijing and across all China..."
#
#### Finland ###
FIN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the northern periphery of Europe, Finland, the bastion of German influence in Scandinavia, proudly stands. Spawned out of the corpse of the Russian empire and with socialism threatening the nation at its inception, the kingdom has developed into a stalwart ally of Germany against the principles of socialism and the imperialistic hands of Russia. But after almost two decades of independence under the guiding hand of its monarch and the national coalition, unrest is festering: is Finland truly free or is German dominion merely a bit more subtle than that of the Tsars of old?"
#
#### Guatemala ###
GUA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The overthrow of the two decade long president Manuel Estrada Cabrera in 1920 and the overthrow of the Unity Party afterwards has led to a decade long dictatorship under José María Orellana. Through various compromises he has been able to keep power by a string through the Americans and various outside influence. However, the rise of Sandino in Nicaragua has caused extreme trouble for his presidency as socialist movements begin to grow and the Unity Party officials begin to ally with elements of the military. Orellana's dictatorship might have its string cut soon."
#
#### Honduras ###
HON_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The suicide of President Andino in 1933 following the peasant charge of the capital created a shock wave throughout Honduras, soon after a peasant republic was established with the goal of gradually rooting out US influence and purging Pro US elements. In 1936 the Council is on the brink of collapse and there are rumours of a conspiracy within the government..."

#### Iceland ###
ICE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Starting in 1874, Iceland had its first taste of independence when Denmark granted the colony home rule. When the guns fell silent after the Weltkrieg, Iceland joined the Mitteleuropa Economic Bloc which brought a period of prosperity to the island. However, this economic prosperity would not last forever. The British Revolution of 1925 shattered the miracle that post-Weltkrieg Iceland was experiencing. The last decade has seen Iceland floundering as its economy never fully recovered from the loss of Great Britain. Many politicians are now bringing forward further plans to revitalize the island."
#
#### League of Eight Provinces ###
LEP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sun Chuanfang's League forms the southern half of an axis which has dominated China for nearly a decade. Years of peace have proven fertile ground for ambition, and with it jealousy. Although Nanjing and Beijing remain united against external foes, they have become competitors as much as allies. Some say the costs of this contest have already begun to take their toll.\n\nLike much of China the League is the product of a careful balance, and Sun's great bureaucratic pyramid may have already begun to crack and crumble..."
#
#### Ma Clique ###
XSM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The three Ma families have cemented their north-western rule for thirty steady years. Siding with almost everyone in China at one point or another, with some Mas even fighting each other for the sake of remaining on the good side of everyone, the Mas are now seen as one of the greatest allies of the new Zhili-led Qing Dynasty.\n\nOf course, not all is well. Ma Fuxiang's heart attack three years ago shook the clique, and a sense of anxiety and unrest has slowly spread ever since. For now the north-west is peaceful, but its future is less certain than many might like to believe..."
#
#### Norway ###
NOR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For Norway, the last two decades could have been better. As a neutral country supportive of the British war effort, the hegemonic power of Germany did not favour the land of the midnight sun and the nation was excluded from the Mitteleuropa project that did include Sweden and Denmark. When Great Britain fell to the hammer and torch, the last trading partner of Norway that was not subject to heavy tariffs was an ocean away. Ever since, Norway found itself in diplomatic and economic isolation, and in the suffering this entails, the syndicalist-inclined Labour Party rises in the polls at an ever-increasing pace."
#
#### Papal State ###
PAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the formation of a united Italy, it had seemed the time for the Papal States to have secular power was a thing of the past. Then came the collapse of the kingdom, and the civil war which followed, and central Italians once again turned to the Papacy and its Sicilian allies to help maintain stability. Now Pope Pius XI is ill, and on his deathbed he laments an Italy that remains divided, with the syndicalists growing ever stronger in the north. Whoever his successor is, he will need God on his side in order to prevail."
#
#### Qing Empire ###
QIE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Qing Empire enters 1936 on the brink. Restored in exchange for German support during the fourth Zhili-Fengtian war in 1927, the Xuantong Emperor remains deeply unpopular and viewed by many as illegitimate.\n\nThe Zhili clique, who trounced both the Fengtian clique and the KMT, stands as the victor of the chaos that engulfed China since 1911, but their domination of the country is far from secure. Enemies from both outside and within threaten their hegemony, and it remains to be seen how long they can hold on to power..."

#### Sardinia ###
SRD_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The House of Savoy was shattered by Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, and King Victor Emmanuel III held responsible. All is not completely lost for the monarchy, however. The Savoy-Aostas are powerful supporters, the rightful holders of Sardinia-Piedmont until their lands on the shores were swallowed up by the syndicalists. Now they and what monarchy supporters they can gather hold out on Sardinia, protected by the French Republic and ready to watch for the opportunity where they, too, can one day return home to claim their seat of power."
#
#### Shandong ###
SQI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Shandong's ruler Zhang Zongchang is preceded only by his armored train and a monstrous reputation. The 'Dogmeat General' is known for violence, vice and corruption, and under his hand the capital of Jinan has steadily come to mirror its master.\n\nHowever, from the peak of Mount Tai, the elusive patriarch Zhang Tianran eschews the depravity below. Instead he hopes to turn back China’s clock by over a century, and guide the country into the arms of his captivating Yiguandao faith. A clash between these contradictory forces may change China forever..."
#
#### Shanxi Clique ###
SHX_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Unlike most other warlord factions, Yan Xishan's Shanxi clique has retained a policy of guarded neutrality for nearly three decades, broken only in times of great threat or great opportunity. Both presented themselves in 1928, and Yan joined Zhang Zuolin against the newly reformed Qing Government.\n\nUnfortunately the subsequent defeat deprived Yan of the eastern portion of his province, and forced him to induct Guominjun remnants to bolster his wavering forces. The consequences of 1928 are far from forgotten, and next time Yan must choose a side he must do so wisely... "

#### Sichuan Clique ###
SZC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sichuan has long been a microcosm of China's many woes, divided and constantly switching controllers since 1911. Yang Sen managed to emerge from the chaos as ruler with help from Wu Peifu's Zhili Clique, but even his control is far from absolute.\n\nFollowing a destructive Tibetan invasion, Yang has come to rely upon internal factions for support, most notably Liu Xiang's Industrial Corps and Deng Xihou's Baoding Department. Meanwhile, the exiled Officer Department has returned to the south with support from Yunnan. The Sichuanese powder-keg may explode once again..."

#### Sweden ###
SWE_KR_GATHERING_STOR_DESC:0 "In the last decade, Sweden developed itself as a bastion of conservatism under the prosperous rule of prime minister Arvid Lindman, profiting from the fruits of the economic growth in Mitteleuropa during the late 1920s and early 1930s. However, clouds are gathering over Stockholm: in 1934, Arvid Lindman retired as prime minister, and has been succeeded by the less charismatic Gösta Bagge, while the social democratic opposition is rallying around their popular party leader Per Albin Hansson. This year Bagge's first elections as prime minister will be held. Can he hold his ground? And if not, can Sweden's democracy survive this sudden reversal?"

#### Two Sicilies ###
SIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies initially sided with Austria during the civil war, a necessary evil to halt the advance of the Socialist Republic. Later, however, when war with the syndicalists seemed inevitable, the Austrians showed their true colours and abandoned the south. The war never happened, but the Sicilains came into the modern era wiser. They will have a difficult time meeting the more industrialized north head on, but that war will someday came and they must be ready for it."

#### West Indies Federation ###
CAF_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The West Indies Federation was created as a result of the collapse of the British Empire in 1925 due to being unable to exert the influence to control the region directly. After the incorporation of the French colonies in 1927 the country has been home to not only a noticeable class divide, but a cultural and ideological one as well. The people and new generation have seen a noticeable drift towards socialist attitudes and preference towards the communards on the mainland. All it could take is one wrong step before chaos erupts on the Indies..."

#### Yunnan Clique ###
YUN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the German re-establishment of the Qing dynasty, the mountainous border province of Yunnan was forced to change its strategy. Governor Tang decided to kowtow to the new Qing Empire, while at the same time opening Yunnan's doors to republican remnants, in order to cement his autonomy and deter action against his notoriously upstart province.\n\nAlthough the situation in China is slowly starting to favour Tang's schemes, it is also beginning to shatter an illusion of provincial unity, as many internal factions no longer see Tang as fit or even sane enough to rule..."

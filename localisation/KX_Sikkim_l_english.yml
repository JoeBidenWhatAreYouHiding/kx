#Leader Descriptions#

POLITICS_TASHI_NAMGYAL_DESC:0 "Crowned by the Dalai Lama in 1914 after the death of his half-brother, His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, is the undisputed sovereign of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Born in Tibet in 1893, Tashi is only the most recent ruler in a dynastic line that has lasted since 1642. Nominally an absolute monarch, Tashi has infamously begun a crusade to reform and liberalize Sikkimese society, but this has come into conflict with the desires of the conservative nobility. Though he receives tacit support from more radical elements, many fear that the king may not be able to go far enough to truly modernize the archaic state of Sikkim, and so the 11th Chogyal walks a razor's edge here at the top of the world as he seeks to bring prosperity to this paradise amid the mountains."
POLITICS_JERMAN_LEPCHA_DESC:0 "Standing as the face of the radical reformist movement called the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha, Jerman Lepcha is the unity figure that binds the various reformist, liberal, and vaguely Socialist groups that seek a modern and prosperous Sikkim free of the nobility and the monarchy. Born in 1910, this young firebrand has waged a mostly peaceful, non-cooperative protest campaign against the deep-rooted and oppressive aristocracy, and now stands as the progressive savior of Sikkimese democracy. Seeking to bring agrarian-minded, Socialist-inspired total societal reform to this archaic land, Sikkim shall never be the same as Jerman guides it and his people towards a uniquely-Sikkimese modernity."
POLITICS_DORJE_DESC:0 "Reincarnated back into this world as his 16th incarnation in 1924 in Tibet near Kham and the source of the Yangtze, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje is the 16th Karmapa - the oldest line of reincarnate lamas, or tulkus, in Vajrayana Buddhism and the spiritual leader of the Karma Kagyu School of Tibetan Buddhism. Considered a living Buddha, the King of the Yogis, and known by many other monikers, his path to being recognized as the 16th Karmapa was mired in controversy. His previous form - Khakyab Dorje - had written a letter that detailed where he would be reincarnated, but the letter was entrusted to his attendant and delayed in delivery to the Dalai Lama, causing the Tibetans to pursue their own candidate who happened to be the son of one of Tibet’s leading ministers, Lungshawa. Once the letter arrived, a debate broke out that lasted well over a year until the opposing candidate, the teenage son of Lungshawa, fell from a roof, breaking his pelvis and dying days later. \n\nAlthough other candidates were put forth by other tulkus and political figures, Rangjung Rigpe Dorge was recognized as the 16th Karmapa in 1931 at Palpung Monastery, performing his first Black Crown Ceremony and taking the Bodhisattva Vows which dedicated him to the cause of achieving full buddhahood for the good of all sentient beings, embarking on the path of becoming a trained tulku and lama. Training under the the 11th Tai Situpa Pema Wangchok and the 2nd Jamgön Kongtrül Khyentse Öser, declaring them to be his root gurus, and also under the 13th Dalai Lama Thubten Gyatso, the 10th Mindrolling Trichen, and the Sakya Trizin, Rangung Rigpe Dorje has much to learn still on his journey towards Nirvana, but he is poised to use his spiritual knowledge and power to make Sikkim a truly prosperous paradise. However, with him largely being the puppet of political forces, whether he can realize this dream remains to be seen."
SKM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "An absolute monarchy since 1642, the Kingdom of Sikkim stands at the crossroads of empires. Once part of the now defunct Raj, Sikkim has survived Nepali, Bhutanese, and Indian ambitions thanks to its Tibetan ally. However, with the Qing in turmoil, Tibet’s military will be preoccupied, leaving Sikkim vulnerable as the reform-minded king seeks to begin a massive liberalization and modernization initiative in order to raise his people out of serfdom. However, with nobles holding him back and radicals threatening revolution if he does not go far enough, Tashi is caught in the middle of competing forces as he tries to guide his nation across this treacherous tightrope and into prosperity."
POLITICS_HELEN_LEPCHA_DESC:0 "Born in 1902 in Sangmu Village of South Sikkim, Helen Lepcha and her family moved to West Bengal shortly after birth where she was able to grow up in the rapidly modernizing tea towns of Kurseoung and Darjeeling. As the region enjoyed the few benefits Anglo imperialism brought, Helen was able to get an Anglo-style education before becoming interested in the Charkha and Khaddar movements that spread throughout the backhills of India. Picking up the anti-colonialist, cultural protectionist, Socialist, and Agrarian ideas of these movements, Helen dove deep into the movements, even becoming a famous weaver and spinner among her clique. Eventually, she left for Calcutta to give deeper into the idea of a Free India, aiding victims in the 1920 floods that rampaged Bihar, and eventually coming into personal contact with Mahatma Gandhi himself. Working to save flood victims together, the ideas and teachings of the Mahatma further drove her to her current ideas, and Gandhi himself even rechristened her as Savitri Devi, a name he felt more in touch with her national rootedness. She would continue this campaign of helping the needy and the downtrodden, joining Gandhi’s non-cooperation movement, and endeavoring to end Indian suffering nationwide. However, her dreams were nearly cut short in 1922 when she was briefly arrested for her activities by Anglo officials, but was soon released as the British Empire and their Raj came crashing down during the fires of the British Revolution. As India split and fractured, Helen stuck by Gandhi’s side, eventually falling in with the Agrarians in Calcutta. With the fall of the Socialist Government and the INC, Helen made her way back home to her native land of Sikkim in order to try yet again to free all of India."
POLITICS_TRILOCHAN_POKHREL_DESC:0 "Born sometime during the 1890s, much about the early life of Trilochan Pokhrel is enigmatic and unknown, but it is known he was born in Tareythang Busty, part of the Pakyong subdivision of East Sikkim. During his youth, he began to be greatly influenced by the words and wisdoms of Gandhi, coming to hold dear the ideas of truth and non-violence unless there is no other option, and falling in with early Quit India movements as well as the Charkha movement. As he grew to be a man, Pokhrel began to emulate his teacher and idol the Naked Fakir, the Mahatma Gandhi. Wearing a cotton dhoti and pair of wooden Khadau sandals, Pokhrel became nicknamed Gandhi Pokhrel, and Bande Pokhral, coming from his constant use of the Bande Mataram prayer. When the British Revolution gave India the chance to be free, Pokhrel stood by Gandhi’s side and fought for a free India, and when Calcutta finally fell and this dream was crushed, he fled here to his home of Sikkim, still professing to be a disciple of the Mahatma and a true freedom fighter. Less ideological driven than his contemporaries in the INC exiles, Trilochan Pokhrel seeks to bring moderated Agrarian Socialism and Syndicalist-inspired democracy to this paradise too, but also seeks to uphold this paradise with the spiritual and philosophical ideas of the Mahatma. Now we shall only see if he is able to fulfill this dream and spread it to all of India."

SKM_ethnic_tensions:0 "The Chaotic Melting Pot of the Himalayas"
SKM_ethnic_tensions_desc:0 "Despite our tiny size, Sikkim is a land of diversity and ethno-religious friction. Between Hindus and Buddhists, our people cannot agree on matters of spirituality, and with bickering ethnic groups always chomping at the bit, our nation suffers from societal schisms. From the dominant Lepchas that control the monarchy and the South, to Limbus and Magars along with Tibetic speakers of the North, to the masses of Indians hailing from various ethno-linguistic groups, and even with the stray souls from China and Bhutan, our nation is at the crossroads of cultures, languages, religions, and empires, and this has turned us into the little melting pot of the Himalayas, for better or for worse. Regardless, these schisms must be mended if our Kingdom is to survive the relentless dawn of modernity."
SKM_archaic_economy:0 "An Archaic and Feudalistic Reality"
SKM_archaic_economy_desc:0 "It is no secret that Sikkim is not an economic superpower. Sikkim isn’t even a regional or local power, and this harsh reality blatantly and painfully shows across the nation. Much of our people live their lives as poor peasants, working fields and paying tithes to the nobility in a feudal system that has existed for centuries. If Sikkim is ever to reach modernity and prosperity, drastic changes must come to our ‘Secret Land of Rice’ among the Himalayas."
SKM_obsolete_army:0 "Archaic Armed Forces"
SKM_obsolete_army_desc:0 "To call the armed forces of Sikkim an army would be a gross overstatement. Aside from the palace guard and police forces employed by the government and by influential families and groups like the Kazis, the bulk of our forces are composed of peasant militias drafted, oftentimes against their will, to defend the nation. Utilizing archaic tactics and wielding medieval weaponry aside from the few firearms in our possession sourced from India, Tibet and the British or created in primitive gunsmithies, this pre-industrial rabble has much to do before it can be considered a true army fit to defend Sikkim in this modern age."
SKM_not_as_obsolete_army:0 "The Beginnings of a Modernized Army"
SKM_not_as_obsolete_army_desc:0 "Though there is still much to do, Sikkim’s once-backwards and largely peasant-based militia has begun to metamorphose into an organized national guard. With modern weapons, equipment, and tactics, we shall slowly pull the Valley of Paradise out of the Dark Ages and into the 20th Century."
SKM_modern_army:0 "Militarized Masters of the Mountain Paradise"
SKM_modern_army_desc:0 "Through intense reform and militarization efforts, imported supplies and the creation of meager domestic industries, and the overall modernization of the state, Sikkim is finally secured and defended behind a mostly modern army. Utilizing our rough terrain, experimental technologies, a mix of guerilla and European strategies, and the natural marksmanship taught to many as part of certain native cultures like the Lepchas all in syncretity with other advances in order to supplement our weaknesses, Sikkim’s army is ready to defend our beloved Paradise until the last soul."
SKM_landowning_elite:0 "Dominance of the Nobility"
SKM_landowning_elite_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Sikkim has been under the thumb of the nobility for centuries, and atop this hierarchy is the Namgyal Dynasty and the largest and most dominant aristocratic clan - the Kazis. From forcing peasants to parade them around in palanquins to working their serfs to the bone in the fields, these blue-bloods rule with an iron fist gilded in gold, and with one hand in the national coffers at all times. However, the current Chogyal is noted for his desire to reform this reality, and from within the shadows, relatively peaceful Socialist revolutionaries clamor for their time to strike, egged on by foreign backers and united by the infamous Jerman Lepcha. The nobility may be dominant, but they walk a delicate tight-rope, and if they are not careful, these aristocrats may finally be pushed from their lofty position."
SKM_chogyal:0 "The 11th Chogyal, Maharaja of Sikkim"
SKM_chogyal_desc:0 "His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, or Bkra-shis Rnam-rgyal, is the 11th Chogyal, or king, and current Maharaja of our paradise, ruling over both the Buddhist and Hindu populations as the one true ruler of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Succeeding his half-brother who died of heart failure in 1914 after only reigning for eleven months, Tashi has stood as the most powerful man in Sikkim for decades. Despite pushback from the nobility - and especially from the Kazis - Tashi is a reformer at heart. His dream for Sikkim is to create a fair and free parliamentary monarchy with himself at the helm, supported by a democratically elected council to aid him in matters of statecraft and beyond. However, this dream is far easier said than done, and the 11th Chogyal will have to be careful, for the scavenging leopards have already begun to circle the reformer king’s throne."

sikkim.1.t:0 "The New Year Dawns on Paradise"
sikkim.1.d:0 "Literally called paradise - Nye-mae-el - by the Lepcha, the dominant ethnic group of the nation, Sikkim is a beautiful and storied mountain refuge safe from the wider world, or at least, it was once isolated. Now, Sikkim has been held hostage in a diplomatic game of tug-of-war, for Sikkim sits at the crossroads of empires on this sliver of the mighty Himalayas. \n\nSikkim has been a monarchy since 1642, dominated by the Namgyal dynasty for over 300 years despite the rise of numerous other empires including the colonial behemoth of the British. A Buddhist family tied to the Lamas ruling over a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state is no easy task, but the Namgyals have managed to keep the Kingdom of Sikkim together for centuries. However, this legacy is now being tested more than ever. \n\nWhen the Raj fell in the wake of the British Revolution, Sikkim was one of hundreds of states to break free from the dying carcass of British Imperialism, but Sikkim now stands nearly alone as a post-Raj state free from the main Indian factions. This independence was not widely wanted outside our borders however, for Nepal, Bhutan, and what has now become the Bharatiya Commune have all tried to absorb our mountain kingdom. Their efforts have all been kept at bay due to the nation’s close ties with and guarantees of national sovereignty by Tibet, for the Lamas of Tibetan Buddhism and the royal family, as well as much of the nobility, have been closely linked for as long as the kingdom has existed. A nominal subject of the Qing, Tibet has been able to defend Sikkim’s independence, but with the wavering Manchu dynasty close to collapse, Tibet is no longer in any position to be able to waste troops guarding foreign borders. \n\nAs the Qing inch closer to collapse, the wolves that circle our kingdom only grow more bold, and soon our independence will surely be tested unless we do something first. It is up to the 11th Chogyal - or king - and Maharaja of Sikkim, His Highness Tashi Namgyal, to guide the nation through the fires of foreign diplomacy while dealing with the rising tides of radicalism and greater calls for reforms. Seeking to liberalize and modernize the nation despite pushback from powerful aristocratic families and groups like the Kazi, Chogyal Tashi must strike a balance and mend the schisms that divide Sikkim lest this paradise come to a burning end under the boots of foreign powers."
sikkim.1.a:0 "Sikkim, Kham-sum-wangdu!"

sikkim.2.t:0 "Tashi’s Gambit for the Reformation of Sikkim"
sikkim.2.d:0 "Chogyal Tashi has long desired to reform Sikkimese society in a major way, pushing for sweeping reforms to the educational system, the healthcare system, the judiciary, the nobility, the economy, and more, virtually rebuilding all of Sikkimese society from the ground up. These reforms would slowly see Sikkim transformed into a mixed-economy populist monarchy supported by a modernized, primarily agrarian industry, greatly expanded social and civil rights, and most groundbreaking of all - the end of the neo-feudal system dominated by the nobility through sweeping land reform and the creation of a true, democratically elected Sikkimese parliament. Modeled on the Indian Congress as well as from both the British and German systems, Tashi seeks to create a syncretic ideology formfit for Sikkim’s unique reality with the wellbeing of the masses as the key concern, earning him the nickname the People’s Chogyal. \n\nHowever, this reformation has one large and near-immovable obstacle - the nobility. Traditionalist, conservative, and resistant to change in most forms, these influential and affluent aristocrats may be subservient to the crown, but there is no secret they truly run Sikkim. If Tashi is to be able to push his desired reforms, he will have to break with most of them, losing him much support that would hopefully be replaced by the democratic and supportive voices of the masses, or he will be forced to heavily compromise his vision. Supporting Tashi, at least for now, is Jerman Lepcha and his band of radical liberal reformers in the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha - a band of peaceful reform-minded protestors pushing for the democratization and liberalization of Sikkimese society. However, though they are peaceful now, Jerman has sworn that should Tashi break his promises for effective reform, he and his growing band of followers will have no other choice than to take matters into their own hands. \n\nWith all this in mind, and with over two decades of ruling experience and preparation already behind him, it is finally time for the 11th Chogyal to decide the ultimate fate of his paradisiacal kingdom."
sikkim.2.a:0 "I am Chogyal, and what I say goes! The final reforms shall be begun!"
sikkim.2.b:0 "We must heed the word of the nobles. It’s not like the serfs will actually revolt."

sikkim.3.t:0 "The Peasant Coup"
sikkim.3.d:0 "With Chogyal Tashi bending to the whims of the spoiled nobility, Jerman and his SKM have decided to drop their pacifistic opposition, taking up arms across the nation in a hastily organized but well-prepared revolution. Using the mountainous terrain and lack of infrastructure or good communications to their advantage, the rebels have already seized the capital after slaughtering the Sikkim Guard garrisoning the royal palace. Though they took ten times the losses themselves, the peasantry have numbers on their side, and it would seem that all hope for the monarchy and the nobility it lost. Jerman Lepcha was true to his word, and with Tashi’s refusal to go through with his reforms, the Tigerslayer himself has risen to lead a new Socialist-inspired but largely non-radical republican government. The centuries-old reign of the Namgyal dynasty is finally at an end as the Sikkimese Revolution comes to a hasty end."
sikkim.3.a:0 "I guess the Chogyal was wrong."

sikkim.4.t:0 "Our Role in the Revolution"
sikkim.4.d:0 "Sikkim has come to embrace its new liberalized and socialized future, and under Jerman Lepcha, our mountain paradise has finally come to embrace its reformative future. However, with our collective now stable and progressing peacefully towards an equal and fair society for all true Sikkimese sons, our place in the wider international revolutionary struggle must be determined. \n\nOur allies and benefactors to the South in Calcutta have aided us greatly, but it is no secret that many within their ranks do not do so out of Socialist unity and camaraderie. The Indians have desired our Sikkim to meld into their borders since our independence was secured after the death of the Raj, and now that we are aligned and closer than we have been since the age of colonial rule, Calcutta has pushed heavily for our complete integration. However, we are a proud people with our own identity and history, and as such, Jerman has resisted this push, instead declaring that we must remain as independent, equal, but loyal allies to the southern colossus, safeguarding our sovereignty as we march together towards a truly prosperous future. With Calcutta pressuring us more and more, Jerman must decide the fate of Sikkim soon."
sikkim.4.a:0 "Sikkim is strong! We shall never cede our sovereignty again!"
sikkim.4.b:0 "We must join the Southern Giant. Move towards union with India."

sikkim.5.t:0 "The First Sikkimese Elections"
sikkim.5.d:0 "Finalizing his sweeping reforms with the pinnacle of his planned liberalizations, Chogyal Tashi has begun to usher in true parliamentary democracy to our paradisiacal Kingdom of Sikkim. Though the king shall still be the absolute and final voice in any and all matters, this democratically elected civilian government will support Tashi as he seeks to further transform Sikkimese society. The main parties are less parties and more just groupings of interest groups within the royal court and among the peasantry - a sort of proto-multiparty democracy that will surely come to become more organized and distinct over time. Safeguarding tradition and resisting most reforms are nobility, who cling to the status quo. Slightly less of an obstacle to full reform are the various princes and monarchist loyalists sworn to Tashi, who desire some small, token reforms to preserve stability without any real changes to the status quo. Opposing these noble-centric groups are the varied reformist factions, which range from small landowners and merchants - our meager but growing middle class - who push for liberal and modernist Capitalist reforms modeled on Keynesian principles and Western agrarian democracies, to the radical peasantry who are split between more liberal-minded monarchists and the radical, Socialist-inspired forces of Jerman Lepcha’s SKM and the Sikkim Progressive Alliance. Whichever faction wins out, Tashi shall still remain as the sole face of Sikkim, but whoever is chosen shall work with our Chogyal to guide Sikkim into its new and democratized future. With the votes being counted by Tashi and his aides themselves, the results are soon to be announced, and the winner shall be..."
sikkim.5.a:0 "The traditionalist nobility secures the status quo."
sikkim.5.b:0 "The conservative nobility and Tashi loyalists force the status quo to budge."
sikkim.5.c:0 "The capitalist reformists championed by our growing landowner class wins out."
sikkim.5.e:0 "The liberal reformists led by the non-radical peasantry secures a win."
sikkim.5.f:0 "The radical reformists of Jerman Lepcha seize the day."

sikkim.6.t:0 "The Lamas"
sikkim.6.d:0 "The Lamas of Sikkim are the highest level of the Buddhist clergy, second only to the Chogyal in influence, though the nobility frequently rivals this power. Spiritually guiding the nation from beautiful and ancient monasteries such as Rumtek, Dubdi, and Ralang, these disciples of the Buddha are Sikkim’s enduring link to their past and their cyclical future. Loyal to the crown and to the Namgyal dynasty as well as the Dalai Lama in Tibet, these clergymen usually put matters of the faith above all, and are frequently mediators and arbiters of conflict within the nation, safeguarding tradition while seeking to bring unity to the varied population. Under their guidance, Sikkim remains tied to its beliefs and its past, and together they help form the fabric of Sikkim’s varied society."
sikkim.6.a:0 "Our ties to the beyond."

sikkim.7.t:0 "The Aristocracy"
sikkim.7.d:0 "Sikkim may be led by the Chogyal, but its society and its people are dominated by the aristocracy. All across our mountain paradise, various influential, wealthy, and domineering noble families and interest groups dominate the peasantry. From forcing them to work the fields as serfs to even subjecting them to carry each noble around in a personalized palanquin, the nobility has held the Sikkimese peasantry under their thumb for centuries, enabling the persistence of a semi-Feudalist society that has stagnated and grown archaic as the rest of the world around us dashed towards modernity. Most powerful of all the noble groups are the Kazis, a group of affluent and highly influential noble contractors and princes poised as the traditionalist anchor of Sikkim. They resist any and all pushes for liberalization and modernization in order to safeguard their positions of power, and are largely led by Kazi Lhendup Dorjee of the Khangsarpa family. Young but fiercely dedicated to Sikkimese tradition, Lhendup leads the Kazis and other noble groups to stand as Chogyal Tashi’s largest obstacle to reform."
sikkim.7.a:0 "Our ties to the past."

sikkim.8.t:0 "The Chogyal"
sikkim.8.d:0 "The Chogyal, or king, of Sikkim has been a position for over 300 years, and has only been held by pure-blooded members of the Namgyal dynasty. Currently, the reformist-minded 11th Chogyal commands the nation, seeking to drive Sikkim towards modernity without losing sight of its storied past. Crowned by the Dalai Lama in 1914 after the death of his half-brother, His Highness Sri Panch Maharaja Tashi Namgyal, Maharaja Chogyal of Sikkim, is the undisputed sovereign of the Kingdom of Sikkim. Born in Tibet in 1893, Tashi is only the most recent ruler in a dynastic line that has lasted since 1642, but his rule is quite unique. Nominally an absolute monarch, Tashi has infamously begun a crusade to reform and liberalize Sikkimese society, but this has come into conflict with the desires of the conservative nobility. Though he receives tacit support from more radical elements led by Jerman Lepcha and his SKM, many fear that the king may not be able to go far enough to truly modernize the archaic state of Sikkim. With instability mounting and with the nobility and the peasantry more rowdy than ever, the 11th Chogyal Tashi Namgyal walks a razor's edge here at the top of the world as he seeks to bring prosperity to this paradise amid the mountains."
sikkim.8.a:0 "Our path to the future."

sikkim.9.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.9.d:0 "We have received a message from an envoy sent out by Tashi Namgyal, King of Sikkim, requesting aid and support in his endeavours in return for closer ties between our nations. Considering how this envoy must have trekked across the Himalayas with some of the most treacherous conditions present just to make deliver this message, some of our supporters believe Sikkim to be in true danger, and we must provide aid immediately. Others are still not convinced and see no reason to waste precious time and resource into such an irrelevant speck of land. What response shall we send the envoy back with?"
sikkim.9.a:0 "Namgyal shall have our full support!"
sikkim.9.b:0 "Begone, we have no need for Sikkim."

sikkim.10.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.10.d:0 "In a matter of strange circumstances, a diplomat under the orders of the King of Sikkim, Tashi Namgyal, has arrived in Delhi, expressing that the micronation that was once under our rule seeks out our aid against the Socialists creeping up upon them. This could be a good opportunity for us to limit the Red’s influence in the Himalayas further – if they were to conquer Sikkim, then Nepal would surely come next, and that is a risk that we cannot ignore. However, there is still much to do back in the Homefront, and Sikkim is certainly not going to be providing us with much of anything. How shall we respond?"
sikkim.10.a:0 "We can always spare a little help."
sikkim.10.b:0 "We are far too busy to send aid. Best of luck!"

sikkim.11.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.11.d:0 "One of the main goals of the Commune of France is to foster Syndicalism worldwide, to one degree or another, and often we get many diplomats, generals, and exiled politicians seeking financial and military support from us. However, today’s ‘guest’ is not an envoy, diplomat, or any person for that matter – it is in fact a letter from the faraway land of Sikkim, of whom wish aid in the form of supplies directly from us, to help foster their socialist cause. Many members of the foreign office, understandably, are hesitant. There is little to no news of this land, or the state of its people. Some in our government cannot even point to where it might be on the global map. For all we know, this can be all an elaborate hoax. However, we cannot allow a Socialist nation’s cry for help to go unheeded, out of our sheer principles. What is to be done?"
sikkim.11.a:0 "Very well, let’s hope this is not some reactionary plot to waste our time."
sikkim.11.b:0 "As if we would ever believe in a country called ‘Sikkim’!"

sikkim.12.t:0 "Sikkim Calls for Aid"
sikkim.12.d:0 "Once again, we have received a request from our tiny ally to the north requesting more aid in order to build its industry and military. For such a small nation, their request is easily doable. Let us just hope they put it to good use, one way or another."
sikkim.12.a:0 "Anything for our Revolution!"

sikkim.13.t:0 "The Ghorkas rise up!"
sikkim.13.d:0 "Instigated by our foe to the north in the form of Sikkim of all places, Nepali Ghorkas in Darjeeling have begun to rebel against our rule en masse, rising up against us in order to bend the knee to the Kingdom of Sikkim! How this came about, we have no idea, but it is vital that we respond to this blatant act of war immediately!"
sikkim.13.a:0 "Let them go, they’re not worth the fight."
sikkim.13.b:0 "To war!"

sikkim.14.t:0 "At the Top of the World"
sikkim.14.d:0 "Against all odds, we have finally come out on top as the sole ruler of the Himalayas. With the Nepalese under our heel and the foolish Dragon King of Bhutan humbled, we have shown the world the true might that is Sikkim. However, none of this would have been possible without the guidance and wisdom of our beloved ruler. His vision for Sikkim does not end here however – now, he seeks to integrate the new lands under our flag as one nation, defined by the true faith of Buddhism. As his people rejoice, his subjugated subjects watch in horror. Only time will tell how this new powerhouse of Asia shall fare." 
sikkim.14.a:0 "We will be the true King of the Mountains!"

sikkim.15.t:0 "Uniting the Mountains"
sikkim.15.d:0 "After a long struggle, we have achieved the impossible; centuries of despotic rule have finally ended in the Himalayas as Jerman Lepcha addresses the hundreds of onlookers attend his celebratory ceremony in the centre of Gangtok. While the journey has been arduous for our people, with help from the Bharatiya Commune and sheer perseverance, we have emerged victorious. The peasantry shall now rule these mountains, as it rightfully should be, and it shall be done under a new flag, under a new nation, as one people!" 
sikkim.15.a:0 "We will unite the Himalayans as one!"

sikkim.18.t:0 "Sikkimese Raids!"
sikkim.18.d:0 "Reports have begun flurrying in of our trade routes and soldiers near the Eastern border being subject to savage raids from the neighbouring Kingdom of Sikkim. While there has been no word from the government of Sikkim, we are not blind. These bandits are not so foolhardy as to attempt to raid us on their own, whilst Sikkimese soldiers are conveniently looking away – it must be a provocation from Sikkim itself, to drag us into war. However, for such a minor nation, causing such a minor nuisance, it might not be such a bad idea as to stop them in their tracks in an act of overestimation." 
sikkim.18.a:0 "Show them the wrath of Nepal!"
sikkim.18.b:0 "We won't fall for their tricks that easily."

sikkim.19.t:0 "Sikkimese Raids!"
sikkim.19.d:0 "An envoy has arrived with reports of gangs of Sikkimese thugs and bandits harassing farmers and troops stationed by our border with the Kingdom from which they arrive. With no word from the Sikkimese government that may justify this blatant disruption of peace, we can only presume the worst. As simply as it may seem for us to wipe out this proverbial housefly to the wind, it may be important to exercise caution. After all, they would not just raid us without a plan…right?" 
sikkim.19.a:0 "Time to give Sikkim a good lesson on humility."
sikkim.19.b:0 "We are wiser than to risk further war."

sikkim.16.t:0 "The Pilot Prince"
sikkim.16.d:0 "The Crown Prince Paljor Namgyal, also called Kunzang Cholay Namgyal, is the eldest son and heir apparent to Tashi Namgyal. Along with his brother Palden Thondup, he stands by his father’s side loyally as an honored friend and respected aid as well as a son. Seeking to bring further honor to his family while fulfilling a lifelong dream of flight, the Crown Prince attended an Anglo military school in Delhi in order to train to become a fighter pilot. Graduating with top honors and with hundreds of flight hours logged, Crown Prince Paljor is the greatest pilot to ever fly for Sikkim, and has since returned to Gangtok to serve as the new chief of the Sikkimese air force, tied to the functions of the Sikkim Guard. With Paljor defending our skies above as his father sits on the throne and guides the nation, the people of Sikkim can be sure that the Namgyals will keep them safe."

sikkim.17.d:0 "Rhoomo Lepcha - famed Sikkimese botanist, naturalist, and academic - has led a new botanical survey deep into the heart of the Sikkimese Himalayas in order to find new plant species for both ecological and medicinal study. Along with her is a small international group of botanists led by the German-American expert on plant anatomy Katherine Esau and the Japanese botanist and ethnologist Minakata Kumagusu, who specializes in fungal analysis while also having an interest in the local isolated minority groups within the mountain ranges of Sikkim. Together with other naturalists, this group seeks to further tap into the unknown and reveal more of the wonders our mountain paradise holds."
sikkim.17.a:0 "We can learn much from this!"

sikkim.20.t:0 "An Old Monument Made New"
sikkim.20.d:0 "Seeking to restore more aspects of both his own family’s legacy and the history of the Kingdom while also proving to the conservative nobility that he is still dedicated to tradition despite his reforms, Tashi Namgyal has utilized more of his personal funds to restore historic and spiritual sites across the nation, from various monasteries and burial sites to stupas and palaces. Most recent of his grand restorations was the total facelift of the Norbugang Chorten - the stupa created by the first Chogyal Phuntsog Nagmyal in 1642 after his coronation by the three highest Lamas in Sikkim at Yuksom. The sacred and serene Kuthok lake is also nearby and of great significance to the monarchy and to local Buddhists, and has become a common pilgrimage site as well thanks to Tashi’s renovations and funding. Sites like these and many others will continue to be renovated as the 11th Chogyal seeks to hold on to our storied past as he progresses to the future."
sikkim.20.a:0 "We honor the first Chogyal and the legacy he enabled."

sikkim.21.t:0 "The Colossus of Sikkim"
sikkim.21.d:0 "The Colossus of Sikkim, Barmiok Athing Tashi Dadul Densapa is the loyal and ever-vigilant right-hand man to Chogyal Tashi. Formally, he is the Nyer-Tsang-Chenmo, or Chief Steward of the Palace, but in practice, he is the closest political ally and lifelong friend of our beloved King. Born in 1902 as the son of a former Chief Steward, Athingla - as he his traditionally called - received formal education at both Colonial Anglo and Tibetan schools before rising to his first government position, and from there he befriended Tashi and climbed the ranks of the Sikkimese hierarchy until he was the chief confidant and advisor to the 11th Chogyal. Standing by his king through his push for reforms and the rise of radicalism and the influence of the Kazis, the Grand Man of Sikkim Athingla aids Tashi loyally and devoutly in this mountainous paradise, safeguarding traditional Sikkimese society and religion against corrosive forces while aiding his friend and liege."
sikkim.21.a:0 "Truly, one of the greatest among us."

sikkim.22.t:0 "The Fate of the People’s Chogyal"
sikkim.22.d:0 "With Jerman waging war against the nobility, many have begun to wonder and question what they should do with the former Chogyal. Since their revolution, Tashi has been confined to house arrest within his palace as Jerman slowly contemplated on what to do with the former monarch. Hardliners and radicals in the party demand his death - to be killed in the same fashion as the Kazis once tried to kill Jerman, by tying him to a table and letting a caged and starving tiger do the rest - but others say elsewise. Many believe that his reformist ambitions, though compromised and failed, earn him some merit, and these groups have come up with two alternate solutions - either send him into exile where he will likely go stay with the entourage of the Dalai Lama, or force him to become a monk in the hallowed Rumtek Monastery where he could do no harm."
sikkim.22.a:0 "There is only one acceptable fate. Send him to the tiger pit!"
sikkim.22.b:0 "Force him to swear the vows and live with the Lamas of Rumtek Monastery."
sikkim.22.c:0 "Banish him to Tibet!"

sikkim.23.t:0 "Meeting an Old Friend"
sikkim.23.d:0 "With the announcement that the newest incarnation of the Dalai Lama had been founded and returned to Tibet, Chogyal Tashi immediately embarked to see his old friend in his new form. Leaving with an extravagant entourage to Lhasa, Tashi and the various countries and lamas accompanying him were abuzz, but this all mellowed soon after they arrived.\n\nFinally arriving at their destination at Potala Palace, Tashi met with his reborn friend, who was now just a young baby from the northern villages. Awkwardly ‘admitting’ he recognized the boy as his old and dear friend, Tashi and the baby Dalai Lama spent some time together as Tashi reminisced old stories about him and the boy’s past life. With their bond reconnected across time and space, Tashi has exclaimed he shall be like an uncle to his old friend, and plans to make frequent visits to Lhasa to help raise and guide the spiritual leader’s new form."
sikkim.23.a:0 "Surely they recognize each other?"

sikkim.24.t:0 "A Brush With Death"
sikkim.24.d:0 "Sitting at the counter within the local inn inside his personal dzong fortress, Jerman relaxed with many of his fellow revolutionaries as they recounted stories of mystery and awe. However, never to be beaten, Jerman had just the story to light a spark in his followers. Casting back to his time spent in prison after being arrested by the Kazis for peacefully obstructing a noble’s palanquin forcibly lifted on the backs of serfs, Jerman described the time he killed a tiger with his own two hands. \n\nTied to a table by his captors and left in a room with a starved and deranged apex predator, Jerman was able to break free from his bonds before the beast could get a hold of him before strangling the beast to death using all his remaining strength. With the beast slain, Jerman made his escape before the guards had noticed the tiger did not make its easy kill, and retreated into the mountains where he survived for days on his own before being picked up by loyal revolutionary allies. \n\nAs always, the story excited his men, sparking to life their morale and their dedication to their reformationist cause. They knew that all they had to do was follow Jerman the Tiger Slayer and Sikkim would reach prosperity."
sikkim.24.a:0 "Clearly you've never fought a tiger."

sikkim.25.t:0 "The Sikkimese Gandhi"
sikkim.25.d:0 "Jerman Lepcha is a well-known reformer and proponent of peaceful resistance, waging a non-violent war of protest against the Kazis and other corrupt and oppressive nobles. Organizing sit-ins, boycotts, prayer vigils, group fastings, marches, and more to resist the aristocratic parasites, Jerman is the voice and face of a free republican future for Sikkim. However, his detractors and opponents do not share his dedication to nonviolence, and much blood has been spilled on the side of Jerman and his allies. Despite it all, Jerman persists, holding faith that Chogyal Tashi will see his dedication and follow through on his promise of sweeping reform, for if he did not, all hope for a peaceful resolution would be lost in the eyes of Jerman."
sikkim.25.a:0 "Let him complain. It’s not like he will do anything."

sikkim.26.t:0 "A Great Wall of Sikkim?"
sikkim.26.d:0 "In order to safeguard Sikkim’s borders and sovereignty while utilizing the resources and terrain available to us, the state has gone forward with a plan to truly fortify our mountain paradise. Utilizing traditional architectural designs, a series of border walls and fortified monasteries - or Dzongs - shall be created across Sikkim. Though we already have many of these stalwart holy houses all across the nation, such as the mighty hilltop fortress known as Kampa Dzong in northern Sikkim, we will need more in order to defend our people and our homes. With tall, inward sloping walls of stone sealed with great gates of iron while decorated internally with all the brightly colored fineries of traditional Buddhist décor, these marvels of engineering shall form a great bastion - both tied to our military, our faith, and our tradition - to deter any would-be invader seeking to trample the mighty Sikkim beneath their foolish ambitions."
sikkim.26.a:0 "We shall never falter behind these great walls."

sikkim.27.t:0 "A Foreign but Friendly Face"
sikkim.27.d:0 "Overjoyed by the news of a Socialist-inspired revolution within our borders, the traveling mystic and Buddhist-Socialist artist and archeologist Nikolas Roerich has come to visit Sikkim. Meeting with Jerman Lepcha in Gangtok, the two devout Buddhists spent ages discussing poetry, art, Socialist theory, and Buddhist theology among other topics while drinking warm yak butter tea and smoking pipe in Jerman’s personal Dzong fortress. Exchanging stories and tales of adventure, the boisterous evening turned into a long night as the two titans of Eastern Theological Socialism conversed and shared ideas. By the time dawn broke once more, the two had still yet to run out of conversation, and their meeting had to be broken up by their aids who recommended to both of them that matters of statecraft must come first over these friendly chats. A solid friendship established, Roerich prepared to return to his adoptive home of Lhasa, promising to return to Jerman’s domain in order to continue their deep discussions on the beyond."
sikkim.27.a:0 "Together, the Himalayas shall be freed and untethered by Earthly desires."

sikkim.28.t:0 "Isolating our Mountain Paradise?"
sikkim.28.d:0 "With our regime relatively stable in the wake of such great change, the time has come to look outwards...or is it? Sikkim lies nestled within one of the safest and most isolated regions on Earth, and if we so desire, we could seal ourselves away in this mountain hold as we work to build our metamorphosed state alone and in peace. However, to do so would be to deny our supposed destiny of uniting the Himalayas and its diverse people - a foolish but common dream for many in our clique. With our past settled and the future wide open, what shall be the destiny of our Sikkim on the world stage?"
sikkim.28.a:0 "Nonsense! The Himalayas call to be united under our will!"
sikkim.28.b:0 "We shall safeguard our hidden mountain home from all outsiders."

sikkim.29.t:0 "Victory in Gangtok"
sikkim.29.d:0 "Despite a successful military campaign in the misty mountains of Sikkim, we still find ourselves at war with the Chogyal's ally in Lhasa. The ethnic and religious brethren of roughly half of Sikkim’s population, the Tibetans atop their plateau at the roof of the world are nigh impenetrable. With our goals achieved, and not wanting to slog up the tallest mountain range on the planet, should we sue for peace?"
sikkim.29.a:0 "We cannot waste our time fighting a pointless war with Tibet"
sikkim.29.b:0 "We will spread the revolution across the Himalayas!"

sikkim.30.t:0 "Defeat in Sikkim"
sikkim.30.d:0 "Despite holding out heroically in the serene mountains of paradise in Sikkim, the Bharat forces proved to be far too powerful and numerous, and as such, Gangtok has fallen. With Sikkim falling before their revolutionary guard, we must decide quickly on what is to be the fate of the once-placid valley of rice. Should we seek revenge for this loss, or simply evacuate the royal family of Tashi Namgyal and pull out?"
sikkim.30.a:0 "Save the Chogyal and his family, and let the nation fall."
sikkim.30.b:0 "We must avenge this defeat at any cost!"

sikkim.31.t:0 "The Kazi Landlords Make Their Move"
sikkim.31.d:0 "Sikkimese society has long been dominated by various groups of aristocratic families and powerful elites. Most oppressive and dominant of all these groups are the Kazi Landlords, who dominate the serf-based agricultural system of Sikkim as well as much of our construction and civic development industries. Long standing as the bastion to conservative and elitist Sikkimese society, the Kazi were disturbed over our revolution, and now have moved to strike. Gathering support from a large section of the military as well as from most of the anti-reformist elite that fear Jerman’s new direction, the Kazi Landlords now seek to topple the current reformist government to stop our government from limiting their power and seizing their wealth. With this wave of support behind them, they have moved to revolt against the revolutionary government, and fighting has broken out across Sikkim. What few loyalists we have in the military are already stretched thin, and we only have enough reinforcements from the militias to aid one of our key regions. Where should we send the militias?"
sikkim.31.a:0 "Secure Gangtok and the Tsuklakhang Palace at all costs!"
sikkim.31.b:0 "The capital is secure enough. Move troops to the countryside!"

sikkim.32.t:0 "Kazi Traitors Defeated"
sikkim.32.d:0 "With our wise decision to secure the capital and the Tsuklakhang Palace, the militia we sent their way arrived just in time to put down the final Kazi offensive. Crushing these traitorous plotters in one fell swoop, the capital and the revolution have been secured. Now we just have to mop up the countryside of the last of these foul snakes."
sikkim.32.a:0 "With these traitors put to the sword, we are free to implement our reforms."

sikkim.33.t:0 "The Kazi Landlords Stand Triumphant"
sikkim.33.d:0 "With our decision to send our last reinforcements to support our units fighting the Kazi guerillas in the countryside, our forces became too spread thin. As a result, when the main Kazi assault pushed on Gangtok and the Tsuklakhang palace where we were holding the rest of the royal family, our meager and tired forces were completely crushed. Now, our revolution falls to the conservative and elitist Kazi as Jerman Lepcha flees into hiding."
sikkim.33.a:0 "They'll need two tigers to take me this time!"

sikkim.34.t:0 "The Fate of the Namgyal Dynasty"
sikkim.34.d:0 "With the final revolutionary guerillas finally being defeated or run off into the Himalayas, we have finally secured our rule here in Sikkim, and after centuries of service to the Namgyal Dynasty, we are now at a crossroads. Our clique is split between the idea of reinstating the monarchy or not, and three options now lie before us. If we were to allow the Namgyal Dynasty back on the throne, they would be entirely subject to our whim and puppets of our desires. The most obvious candidate would be to crown the Crown Prince Palijor Namgyal, a veteran and ace pilot who is studying abroad with the British in Delhi. Though definitely fit to rule, he may be hard to control and is beloved by the masses, making him a potential threat. Instead, we could crown the young Palden Namgyal, who is merely a child and as such would be far easier to control and mold to our will. Finally, we could abandon the monarchy altogether, establishing a conservative and aristocratic republic under Kazi rule. What should we do?"
sikkim.34.a:0 "Coronate Palijor Namgyal, the Pilot Prince."
sikkim.34.b:0 "Crown Palden Namgyal, the Young Chogyal."
sikkim.34.c:0 "We need the Crown no longer. The Kazi shall rule alone."

sikkim.35.t:0 "White Fever"
sikkim.35.d:0 "In need of a bride in order to secure his lineage and right to rule, Chogyal Palden Namgyal has brought home a particularly interesting choice for a bride. Long infatuated with Western women and their ideals of beauty, Palden Namgyal has invited the beautiful American comedy actress Carole Lombard to be his bride. Flattered by the invitation and enticed by the free ticket to a life of ease and luxury, Lombard accepted Palden’s proposition and has flown out to Gangtok in order to become the Gyalmo, or Queen Consort, of Sikkim. In a lavish Buddhist ceremony, the two were wed, and Chogyal has never seemed happier. Let us hope they have a long and happy marriage!"
sikkim.35.a:0 "I guess Sikkimese women just don’t cut it for the King."

sikkim.36.t:0 "The First Sikkimese Republican Elections"
sikkim.36.d:0 "Winning out in the internal debate against their aristocratic counterparts, the reformist Kazi landlords have organized and now called for the first fair and free republican elections in Sikkim. In the running are the dominant Sikkim National Party, split into two camps. The Kazi-Sikkim Hamro Party are primarily Kazi aristocrats who support Sikkimese independence, conservatism, nationalism, traditionalism, neo-feudalism, and autarky, but are hamstrung by their coalition allies in the Sikkim National Buddhist Party, which are a group of theocratic and hyper-nationalist militant Buddhists. Their main rivals are the Sikkim State Congress - a large coalition of agrarian liberals and capitalist conservatives predominantly made up of the large Nepalese and Indian minorities. Their internal factions are the Liberal Agrarians of the Sikkim Independent Front and the Keynesian Capitalists of the Sikkim Republican Party. Trailing behind both of these main coalitions are the remnants of Jerman Lepcha’s failed Sikkim Progressive Alliance. The Social Democrats and moderate Progressives of the SKM have broken off to form the Sikkim Democratic Front, moderating their stances dramatically but still pushing for a radically progressive and egalitarian Sikkim democracy, and are committed to work within the democratic system to achieve it. However, only one party can win, and with the final votes being counted, who shall win these historic elections?"
sikkim.36.a:0 "The conservative nationalists in the KSHP seize the day."
sikkim.36.b:0 "The conservative and market-orientated wing, the SRP, wins out."
sikkim.36.c:0 "The agrarians in the liberal wing of the SSC, the SIF, win out."
sikkim.36.e:0 "Shocking all, the remnants of the radical SKM, the SDF, eke out a win."
sikkim.36.f:0 "In an upset win, the radical nationalist wing of the SNP, the SNBP, rise to rule Sikkim." 

sikkim.37.t:0 "Finalizing the Leadership Debate"
sikkim.37.d:0 "As we further stabilize our new regime, the internal leadership debate that has long brewed within our ranks must finally be put to rest. The two main factions vying for power are the deeply conservative and anti-democratic Old Guard, made up of old elites and aristocrats that seek to build a republic without democracy here in Sikkim, perhaps even with a puppeted Chogyal on the throne. Resisting these elitists are the small but dedicated wind of reformers within the Kazi clique led by Kazi Lhendup Dorjee. These reformers have greatly distanced themselves from any of the rhetoric or actions of Jerman Lepcha, but still advocate for a more equal Sikkimese society supported by free democracy. Only one group can lead Sikkim and the landlords however, so who shall rise to lead us into our new destiny?"
sikkim.37.a:0 "Those peasants almost killed us! Double down on our policies."
sikkim.37.b:0 "In a win for democracy, the reformist Kazis come out on top."

sikkim.38.t:0 "Lets Try This Again"
sikkim.38.d:0 "Tied to the table he had been strapped to just a few years ago, Jerman Lepcha sweat profusely as he heard the low growl coming from the horrors to come. Locked in a familiar dungeon he had been in before, Jerman was arrested by the Kazi after being caught by their loyal gurkhas in the lowlands on the way to Calcutta, being caught disguised as a petty and elderly serf trying to seek asylum with the Southern Socialists. Instead, he will now meet the fate that should have befallen him years ago, and this time he will not be able to fight his way out. As the cage doors opened before him, the last thing Jerman Lepcha saw was the orange and black blur of two massive Bengal tigers diving at his full speed. In moments filled with agonizing screams, blood-curdling cries, and the sounds of roaring and tearing flesh, all that was left of the failed revolutionary was a pile of bones, blood, and refuse tissue and organs too distasteful for the beasts to consume. It would seem that the man that could kill one tiger with his bare hands could not kill two."
sikkim.38.a:0 "You asked for two tigers, and look at what it got you."

sikkim.39.t:0 "A Surprising Victory"
sikkim.39.d:0 "Pushing back the Bharati forces, our mountain guerillas descend from our hidden valley of rice and have taken our claimed lands in Darjeeling. Now, the verdant tea fields and orchards in this paradise inhabited by our kin are ours, and the people here rejoice for it. Not wishing to get slogged down in a guerilla war at such a dire time, the Socialists have agreed to a peace summit, but we suspect they will be back later. Regardless, we have peace finally in our time, at least for now."
sikkim.39.a:0 "A modern tale of David and the Goliath."

sikkim.40.t:0 "Rocket-Speed Communications"
sikkim.40.d:0 "After many successful tests and experiments with the technology, rocketmail has begun to be applied in both civilian and military applications all over Sikkim, with new bus services and ski-using couriers aiding in deliveries. However, far more present in the public eye has been Stephon Hector Taylor-Smith’s most recent display of the new technology. \n\nBy working with fellow rocket scientist Dr. Friedrich Schmiedl - a contemporary from Austria who has also made advances in rocketmail technology but has had to work largely in secret due to restrictions from the Austrian government - Taylor-Smith has been able to showcase a long-range test of their devices. Schmiedl traveled to Delhi where he launched his own rocket at Sikkim while waiting for the rocket sent by Taylor-Smith to reach him from Gangtok, with each holding a simple message in a secure mail tube. Miraculously, both rockets made it to their destinations, though each was several hundred meters off-target due to the extreme range the experimental technology was pushed to. Regardless, the experiment was a success, bringing more prestige to the project and in turn, to the state."
sikkim.40.a:0 "You've got Na-mail-gyal!"

sikkim.41.t:0 "The Creation of Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve"
sikkim.41.d:0 "The Lepcha do not call our nation Paradise for nothing, for Sikkim truly is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. With unique flora and fauna showcased in breathtaking and verdant venues, it is only natural that we should work to preserve these natural treasures. In the western reaches of Northern Sikkim, the Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve shall be created in order to safeguard these living wonders. Named after the third tallest peak in the world and the tallest mountain in Sikkim, this reserve shall be home to creatures of all types, such as red pandas, clouded leopards, musk deer, oh my. The skies shall be filled with blood pheasants, griffon vultures, snowcocks, and more, all safe from poaching and environmental destruction. With [root.getleader] organizing the creation of this new natural preserve, all in Sikkim and all those who visit our Paradise shall be able to take in the wonders of our biosphere. Additionally, many traditional Lepcha settlements still exist within the park boundaries, giving visitors a look into the ancient ways of our peoples, while the nearby Tholung monastery - one of the most sacred monasteries in all of Sikkim - provides a spiritual sight for visitors to take in as well. With these treasures preserved and with parks like this or others like it such as Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary in Ravangla, we will never lose sight of our beloved past and homeland."
sikkim.41.a:0 "We shall preserve this paradise we call home one acre at a time."

sikkim.42.t:0 "Taming the Mountains"
sikkim.42.d:0 "In order to tame the rough terrain of this nation so that we may utilize these unique features in wartime, the Sikkim Scouts have been created. Designed to work in synchrony with our Gorkha volunteer allies, these forces shall form the bulk of our elite mountaineer units. Utilizing guerilla tactics and specialized equipment like cable-cars and skis for easy transportation artillery pieces designed to trigger avalanches, drilled by our leading generals and wisest mountain guides, and trained in mountain survival and rock-climbing techniques while supported by rocketmail logistics and communications lines, these alpinists will tame the Himalayas like none other. Let them be the sword and shield of our mountain paradise."
sikkim.42.a:0 "All shall fear the mountains of Sikkim."

sikkim.43.t:0 "Vertical Developments"
sikkim.43.d:0 "Utilizing economic ties with German businesses and military contractors, we have been able to secure experimental helicopter prototypes from the Kaiserreich. Named the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 Drache, or Dragon, these unique aerial vehicles are capable of vertical take-off and landing, making them perfect for use in the Himalayas. Though expensive and fragile, we have been able to source a few models by selling the Germans rare ores from our deepmines at Bhotang, allowing us to form the Sikkim Helicopter Service. With our growing airfleet also using autogyros, hafner rotabuggies, and other novel transports devised by the Anglos and their Indian lackeys, we shall be able to ferry our populace, our goods, and our troops all around Sikkim without issue or delay. Just be careful not to crash any, for we only have a fragile few, and they are currently very temperamental and very irreplaceable."

Beijing is ours, and so too is the Forbidden City and the Dragon Throne within. We have seized the Mandate of Heaven like the Mongol and Manchu conquerors before us, subjugating the world’s mightiests and longest-lived civilization beneath our icy treads. \n\nNow, all we must do is decide on how best to administer this massive swathe of land. We could embrace the blood-line of the Namgyal Dynasty all the way back to the great Guru Tashi of the 13th Century House of Minyak who was prophesied by the godly Guru Rinpoche to one day lead Sikkim and our people to greatness, proclaiming a new Great Xia. However, we could distance ourselves from these monarchist notions while still embracing our Tibetic culture by announcing the recreation of Mi-nyak - the Tibetic translation of the Chinese-derived Great Xia, or Xi Xia. Finally, we could simply go with the easiest and least biased solution, proclaiming the Second Tangut Empire as we attempt to mirror the greatness of our ancestors. What shall we do?"

Based around ideas of preserving the natural beauty of our paradise, respecting the traditions of the many different tribes of Sikkim, and bringing egalitarian prosperity to all within the nation, the rhetoric of Jerman has begun to coalesce into its own school of Socialist theory. However, that is not the only Socialism rising in Sikkim. Due to recent visits and the growing friendship between the famed mystic Nikolas Roerich and Jerman Lepcha, the esoteric Buddhist ideas of this guru have started to influence Jerman and many within his camp, who push for either a Red Theocracy or a Socialist-Buddhist Monarchy puppeted by the Clergy and the Party. As we prepare to start our next step of the Revolution, Jerman is now left with a choice on what is to be the true future of Socialism in Sikkim."

Though many of their members have been taken in by the LKMT in China or the Syndicalists in Europe, we too have done our part and taken in many of these fleeing Indian nationals, allowing them to seek refuge in our state so long as they remain loyal to our own brand of Socialism now instead.

sikkim.50.d:0 "Though the Kazis have dominated Sikkim for centuries and long gotten what they desire, they are far from a united front. Within their ranks and the ranks of their allies in the nobility and wider aristocracy, factionalism plays its part as it does in any other large coalition. The main groups vying for power in this day and age can be broadly defined as falling into large camps, being the ‘liberals’ largely composed of Anglo-inspired Keynesian Capitalists that seek economic growth and minor liberalizations, and the ‘conservatives’ who are largely traditionalists, standing as the old guard and defenders of the status quo, though they themselves are also minorly split between a group seeking token reforms and a group seeking total dedication to tradition.

However, some have claimed that perfection has already been achieved, and that we have become worthy of bearing the name Shambhala - the heavenly kingdom of Buddhist tale. To claim such a title would offend many, especially our fellow Buddhists around the world and particularly in Tibet and Mongolia, but that would be but a small price to pay for rising as the embodiment of total Buddhist piety.

Though the Chogyal will enjoy far fewer of the powers and privileges he once enjoyed, and although the Party shall rule through him, he is still to be a deeply revered and respected figure no matter the rocky road that has led us here. Let us forget the mistakes and rash actions of the recent past and work together to build a better, more prosperous Sikkim!"
sikkim.53.a:0 "All hail the Chogyal! All hail the Namgyal Dynasty! All hail the new Sikkim!"

sikkim.54.t:0 "The Referendums"
sikkim.54.d:0 "Though our armies have raged against the titans of the Indian subcontinent and won, we are not done in our conquest in this fertile and varied land. To the South, to the East, and to the West, lands claimed by India - and in turn, our new Sikkim - lie in the hands of foolish radicals and misguided demagogues. However, these lands are either too small, too isolated, or in too rugged or otherwise frustrating terrain to fight in, and as such, an all out land war to gain these territories for our state would be foolish and costly. \n\nWith this in mind, [root.getleader] has declared for referendums on independence versus annexation to be held in all of these borderlands, threatening full military action if the states refused. To our delight, these hinterland sovereignties have heeded our warning, and have held referendums within their states. To ensure a good outcome for our intentions of annexation, we have utilized methods of voter suppression, harassment, and tampering as well as open propagandizing near polling sites and forcibly closing other voting centers in regions within these states with known disdain for our government. Through ‘fair’ and ‘free’ democracy in chains and at the end of a gun barrel, we shall ensure that these states vote the right way as we prepare for them to enter the fold. We will even station troops at the borders and near key voting areas in order to ‘peacefully’ oversee the referendum processes, and step in should violence break out, which it surely won’t...right?"

Though the 16th Karmapa is still young, he has great spiritual authority, and shall also be the perfect moldable puppet to rule through. Leading from the restored Rumtek Monastery in Gangtok, these two national figures shall work together as they herald this new age for Sikkim. Karma Kagyu Buddhism and Esoteric Leninism shall become the main foundations of the state as the Kagyu Clergy and the Sikkimese National Buddhist People’s Party work in tandem to build a pious and prosperous proletarian paradise."

sikkim.57.d:0 "As more and more Indian Socialist flood into Sikkim from the South, fleeing the fall of Calcutta and their Socialist experiment, a group of exiles from the Indian National Congress have begun to pressure Jerman to incorporate more and more of their beliefs. Though they are Agrarian Socialists in part, like ourselves, they are staunchly Syndicalist - representing a fusion of the more moderate Agrarian and Anarcho-Syndicalist factions of the INC. As these exiles push their Syndicalist rhetoric on Jerman Lepcha more and more, his stress and disdain for leading our nation only grow. Sensing an opportunity to strike, the INC exiles, led by Agrarian Syndicalist Helen Lepcha - also called Savitri Devi - and the freedom fighter Trlochan Pokhrel, have propositioned Jerman with a deal - he would continue to be the face of the Sikkimese Revolution and the official Head of State, but more and more duties of the state would be given over to these INC exiles in the Sikkim Janata Parishad National Congress - their own established Syndicalist party here in Sikkim - as they come to dominate the state apparatus. However, Jerman is no slouch, for he is the one man who has been able to disrupt centuries upon centuries of decay and stagnation with his Revolution, and he may still have the will to endure the rigors of rule for as long as his people need him."

sikkim.58.d:0 "With the recent electoral success of the Sikkim Progressive Alliance and more specifically their Social Democratic branch that is the Sikkim Democratic Front, the peasantry of our nation have begun to rejoice, but not all are happy over this win. The Sikkimese nationalists and fundamentalist clergymen that make up the Sikkim National Buddhist Party, along with the elitist conservatives and traditionalist Kazi landlords that make up the Kazi-Sikkim Hamro Party, fear that their window of opportunity is closing rapidly, and have chosen this moment to strike. Allied in a temporary coalition called the Sikkimese National Party, these defenders of tradition have launched a soft-coup against the democratically elected government, and their last hope is that the Chogyal steps in to save them."
sikkim.58.a:0 "The coup attempt is crushed and the Nationalists are barred from future elections."

sikkim.59.d:0 "The soft-coup perpetrated by the Sikkimese National Party has been successful, and now all that remains to be done is to choose a final direction for our paradise. The clergymen, army officers, and militant Buddhists of the SNBP wishes to implement a new theocratic form of government under the leader of the local school of Kagyu Buddhism - the 16th Karmapa - and a puppeted Chogyal, while the aristocratic elites of the KSHP wish to guide Sikkim back towards our centuries-old status quo.

sikkim.60.d:0 "With the announcement that the Old Guard of the Kazi landowners have won out in their power struggle against the Democratic reformers, the Kazi-Zamindars have been largely free to guide Sikkim back towards the status quo. However, a group of power hungry Buddhist clergymen have begun to grow in influence, calling themselves the Sikkimese National Buddhist Party. These fundamentalists seek to use the young 16th Karmapa - tulku and current spiritual leader of the local Karma Kagyu variant of Tibetan Buddhism - and the surviving young son of the last Chogyal as a facade through which they will rule Sikkim and work to realize their theocratic dream. So enticing are their ideas that they have begun to steal support and party members away from our movement, slowly becoming a more dangerous threat. Though it would be foolish to act now due to the power and influence the Clergy still holds, we must remain vigilant."
sikkim.60.a:0 "We should keep an eye on these power hungry clergymen."

sikkim.61.t:0 "The Clergy Makes Their Move"
sikkim.61.d:0 "Seeking to ensure Sikkimese independence by creating a theocratic Buddhist government grounded in nationalism and ruling through the facade of both Palden Namgyal as a puppeted Chogyal and the 16th Karmapa as a puppeted spiritual leader, the Sikkimese National Buddhist Party has attempted to coup our administration. Storming the capitol with militant Buddhist monks and a mass peasant militia led by traitorous army officials, these fundamentalists seek to create a new Theocracy here in Sikkim under the Karma Kagyu school of Buddhism and guided entirely by the Party. As we prepare to mount our desperate defense, we can only hope that the spirits and the Buddha are on our side."
sikkim.61.a:0 "The Kagyu Clergy has been stopped, and the SNBP is dissolved."
sikkim.61.b:0 "The Theocrats take Gangtok!"

sikkim.62.t:0 "Sikkim’s Lost Sister"
sikkim.62.d:0 "Helen Lepcha, named by Mahatma Gandhi as Savitri Devi, is one of the two leading figures of the INC exiles within our nation. Known as Sikkim’s Lost Sister or our Daughter of the Soil, was born here in Sikkim but moved with her family to India at a young age. Getting a good education in Darjeeling, she eventually fell in with the precursor groups that would form the Quit India movement. An aid worker and healer, she worked to care for disaster victims which led her to meet Gandhi, and together they began their peaceful movement of non-action against the Anglos. When the British Empire finally fell with their revolution, she rode to the top of the Calcutta government, but with their failures apparent, she made her way back home to us. A committed Agrarian Socialist influenced by the Syndicalist attitudes of the Anglo-inspired Indian National Congress, Helen Lepcha, or Savitri Devi, seeks to bring about an agrarian paradise here in our Sikkim based on egalitarian democratic socialist ideas. Seeing the Lepcha people and all of Sikkim as part of the wider Indian whole, she stresses cultural preservation and syncretism as we make Sikkim part of India, and India part of Sikkim. However, she also wishes to spread this dream beyond the borders of Sikkim itself, seeking to free India once and for all by uniting the entire subcontinent under our rule. Whether this far-fetched dream will come to pass or not matters not, at least for now. In the meantime, Savitri Devi will endeavor to create the verdant, free, and distinctly Indian paradise she has always dreamed of."

sikkim.63.t:0 "Sikkim’s Lost Son"
sikkim.63.d:0 "Less openly ideological than his counterpart, friend, and ally Helen Lepcha, Trilochan Pokhrel is the second dominant figure within the Indian National Congress exiled here in Sikkim. Sikkimese born himself,  Pokhrel has been traveling since his youth, and all that traveling has only brought him back here home to us. A student of Gandhi so devoted that he even dresses like him, Pokhrel is also known to be friends with other titans of Indian politics like Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarojini Naidu, and Lala Lajpat Rai, still corresponding and meeting with them to this very day. Dedicated to bringing about a peaceful revolution here in Sikkim while emphasizing our Indian roots, the spiritual and cultural links we all share, and the truths of the Mahatma. However, for all his good spirits and tidings, Pokhrel has no mercy for one particular group. Inside Pokhrel burns a raging disdain for the Imperialist British that once put his beloved homeland under their boot at the barrel of a gun, and he awaits the day that each and every last person responsible for British imperialism in India is found and brought to justice."
sikkim.63.a:0 "We all pray for the Gandhi of Sikkim, and hope he can bring us to salvation."

sikkim.64.t:0 "Two Sacred Unions Enter..."
sikkim.64.d:0 "It has come to our attention that both Sikkim and Tibet have come to embrace the Esoteric Leninist and Buddhist ideas of the mystic Nikolas Roerich. With our goals aligning, should we move to unify in order to create a stronger Sacred Union of the East?"

Should we begin to embrace these new peoples and new lands, creating a new identity that is inclusive to all of our people, or should we stick with the identity that has carried us through these wars since our independence?"
sikkim.65.a:0 "Stay with the identity that has carried us this far."
sikkim.65.b:0 "Embrace our new Indian identity."

sikkim.66.t:0 "Face of the Exiles"
sikkim.66.d:0 "As the INC exiles of the Agrarian Syncialist Helen Lepcha and the spiritual freedom fighter Trilochan Pokhrel continue to take over more and more of the state’s functions, a question on who should lead as the face of the nation and de-facto Head of State has arisen. Most of Jerman’s loyalists as well as the bulk of the wider Progressive coalition support Jerman staying as the main leader and face of the state, even if he is not the one calling all the shots, and have announced that they would be open to compromise with the INC exiles. This compromise would have Jerman co-lead with either the entirety of the INC exiles as one entity, or would have him choose to share the executive position with either Helen or Pokhrel. With our administration gridlocked, it is up to Jerman once more to make a choice that will decide the destiny of Sikkim."
sikkim.66.a:0 "Jerman stays as leader, and the INC exile council will rule with him."
sikkim.66.b:0 "Jerman and Helen Lepcha shall guide the new revolution towards Agrarian Syndicalism."

sikkim.67.d:0 "With an independent Tibet no longer existing, Nicholas Roerich, his wife, and his two sons have come to our government seeking shelter. The creator of the ideology we follow and the Father of Esoteric Leninsm, or Roerichism, he could impart great wisdom to our cause if we were to give him a place within our government as an advisor and a spiritual leader. Instead, we could just let him live in peace in our beautiful Socialist utopia as Jerman Lepcha guides the state with [root.getleader]. Alternatively, we could allow this honored figure to take the reins of our nation itself, guiding Sikkim on true to paradise."

This paradise within the Himalayas, also called Drenjong by the Tibetans meaning the Hidden Valley of Rice, is one of the most isolated, pristine, and beatious places on Earth. For centuries, the Namgyal Dynasty has ruled over these lands, and for centuries, we have persisted despite the many obstacles thrown at us. However, with tensions brewing, radicalism spreading, and with the world seemingly on the brink of war yet again, all is not well in this mountainous paradise. We must remain vigilant as Chogyal Tashi Namgyal attempts to guide us through to prosperity."

However, no clerical group within Sikkim is more influential than the Buddhist Lamas, for even our beloved Chogyals are crowned by each incarnation of the Dalai Lama. Though dominant, their role in the government is often a large and messy grey area, and as such, we should move to formalize the role these holymen have in our Kingdom."

We must remain on their good sides if Tashi is to achieve anything during his reign, but that is easier said than done when his reforms fly directly in their faces.

However, with the rising popularity of the radically liberal Sikkim Kratiakari Morcha slowly growing more and more tired of the exploitation wrought at the hands of the aristocracy underneath but unshackled by the king, the continuation of this centuries-old monarchy is far from assured."

Tashi has worked tirelessly with the nobility in order to reach some forms of agreeable compromise, and has begun to transition some of Sikkim’s land into the hands of the masses. Small landowners have begun to rise up from the most hardworking, the most savvy, and the more influential of the lower classes. Though it is a far cry from a total break from feudalism, it is a massive step in a modern direction for such a tiny nation, and this change will be monitored closely as the masses of Sikkim step from 1666 into 1936."

Their lands will be nationalized and prepared for redistribution while their assets are liquidated and dispersed to government funds and programs as well as the masses, and they themselves will largely face exile, prison, or death, with only special exemptions being made for non-corrupt nobles that are members of the various clergies and other nobles that championed the cause of the people before Jerman’s rise.

A true middle class has slowly begun to develop and the economy only grows as we ride the wave of supply and demand out of the feudal age and into modernity, and now we only have to guide this wave to the top. All forward for Capitalism and modernity as we embrace this economic miracle."

skm_soccon_victory_desc:0 "Marking a win for traditional and conservative Sikkimese society and culture, the Kazi-Sikkim Hamro Party, along with their allies in the mainline Sikkimese National Party, have come together to lead this new chapter in our history. Deeply tied to the Namgyal dynasty though resistant to many of Tashi’s old reforms, this group of elitist conservatives will seek to humanize our society and smooth out the rough edges while still maintaining strict adherence to the centuries-long status quo."

skm_perpetuate_kazi_dominance_desc:0 "Though we are a democracy, that does not mean that we need to fully cede power to the oftentime ignorant and misguided masses. The people are fickle, but the aristocracy is time-tempered and experienced like none other. Chief among these elites are the Kazi landlords along with the Thekadars, the Mandals, and especially the Zamindars, and by continuing to enable their dominance over society, Sikkim shall only benefit. Sure, some may cry for more equality and less obvious elitism, but it is necessary to ensure that we reach modernity and prosperity without falling to chaos or losing sight of our traditions."

skm_humanize_serfdom_desc:0 "Serfdom is a harsh reality for our semi-feudalist state, and will take decades to fully erode and replace. However, as we work towards this eventual goal, that does not mean we cannot improve the situation along the way. By humanizing and softening the serf system by improving conditions, granting basic rights, improving wages, and more, we can raise their quality of life while also ensuring their democratic support. Who knows, it might even improve the economy along the way."

skm_paternalist_humanism_desc:0 "Though we shall not erode the atmosphere of paternalism that exists around the upper classes, we can work to channel this dominance into useful outlets. Through populism and token humanism, we shall ease the plight of the lower classes while earning their support in turn. We shall undergo our own small form of cultural reformation and renaissance while maintaining the elitist paternalism and mild authoritarianism that has always kept Sikkim strong and safe."

skm_pious_paradise:0 "A Pious, Proud Paradise"
skm_pious_paradise_desc:0 "Though our Sikkim holds many religions within its borders, our nobility and those in charge are largely Buddhists of one school or another, and as such, Buddhism shall remain the state religion. We shall embrace our faith and continue to utilize militant Buddhist ideas in the training of our armed forces while working to expand the clergy and maintaining the monasteries which stand as cultural, spiritual, and historical monuments to our great legacy. Sikkim shall forever stand pious and proud, and our Paradise shall never falter!"

Seeking to puppet the monarchy and the rest of the nation under their theocratic ideas, this group of nationalists, monks, lamas, and army generals is united in their dedication to keeping Sikkim safe, secure, and Buddhist, and will not let any other obstacles get in their way."

skm_tibet_sikkimese_nationalism_desc:0 "Though Sikkim has long been home to dozens upon dozens of different peoples, we know the truth. Without the continued dominance of the Tibetic-Sikkimese peoples, Sikkim would surely fall to ruin. We shall embrace Sikkimese nationalism over any other ethnic identity, granting special privileges and rights to those of our blood. Though we shall not wage war upon our own citizens just because of their blood or background, that does not mean they need to enjoy all the same special allowances we give to our chosen people. It takes all kinds, but our kind is best."

skm_restore_traditionalism_desc:0 "As Sikkim moved towards democracy, many within our group became wary that we have begun to lose touch with our past traditions and glories. To assuage these fears and to limit the inevitable crawl towards modernity and the degeneracy it breeds, we shall enshrine the traditionalist attitudes, customs, traditions, and more of our people and particularly of the aristocracy in law. This shall ensure that no matter where the world takes us, we shall remain rooted in what truly makes Sikkim Sikkim."

Ever-present at the upper rings of our society, Buddhism is only outpopulated by the influx of Nepali and Indian Hindus from the South. In order to resist the Hindu incursion while also ensuring that the teachings of Karma Kagyu are forever present in Sikkimese governance, the SNBP has moved to officially transform Sikkim into a functioning Theocracy. The Black Hat lamas shall rule from behind the facade of the Party, the 16th Karmapa, and the Chogyal, ensuring that the Karma Kagyu school dominates all of Sikkimese society."

Furthermore, our spiritual leader, the reincarnated 16th Karmapa, will be held here and utilize this historic monastery as the seat of our new Theocracy. With its central location near Gangtok and near Tsuklakhang Palace, it shall be the ideal location for the heart of our new administration. The repair of Rumtek shall also kickstart our new program to repair the old monasteries and monastic forts around the nation, as well as funding the creation of new ones. Though the older lamas and the Party shall govern and administer the state through the young guru and Living Buddha Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, he shall always be the final authority on all spiritual and cultural matters."

The clergy and the state shall care for and provide everything our chosen people could possibly need, and we shall preserve the natural beauty of this heaven without compromise, even if we must maintain some of our feudal ways to do it.

Fusing traditional beliefs and practices of the Lepcha people and other tribes of Sikkim along with ideas of Democratic Socialism, Agrarianism, Anarchism, Communalism, and Eco-Socialism, this new form of Socialism, dubbed ‘Jermanism’ by his followers, shall become the foundation of our new egalitarian paradise."

skm_sikkimese_socialism_desc:0 "The feudal realities of Sikkim are an issue, but also an opportunity. Already decentralized and based around estates, this archaic reality is the perfect bedrock to establish a semi-anarchist democratic society in. Estates and land plots shall be transformed into voluntary democratic socialist collectives that shall be federated and cooperate for the good of the state. Our people shall live as they always have, but now free and in charge of their own destinies as we progress towards a more egalitarian and prosperous future."

skm_incorporate_tribal_structures_desc:0 "Sikkim has long been a land of disparate tribes all living their own way, with this reality only really falling to more standard societal structures in large cities like Gangtok. A Lepcha himself, Jerman has moved to incorporate the tribal structures and autonomies directly into the new communalist system, allowing tribes and other settlements to function as their own communes and communities while also having an equal say in the wider government and economy, ensuring that their unique traditions and customs are not washed away in our drive towards progress."

skm_cultural_synthesis:0 "Cultural Reform and Synthesis"
skm_cultural_synthesis_desc:0 "The various cultures and customs of Sikkim’s varied peoples must be synthesized into one cohesive Sikkimese identity. We must approach this carefully however, for we do not want to muddy or dilute the specific traditions and the peoples that they originated from, but also want to have them all included in our own identity. With this new syncretic culture, we shall be able to resist the massive empires around us, solidifying our own unique identity, ideology, and society distinct and separate from the giants around us. Sikkim is Sikkimese, and it shall stay that way. Now we just have to fully define what being Sikkimese is."

skm_exporting_the_reformation_desc:0 "Our revolution has been a reformation more than anything, with our society making our journey into Socialism a relatively peaceful and smooth transition. However, the time for peace has ended, and the time for war is upon us. It is our duty to export this reformation as the heralds of this new, perfected Socialist thoughtform known as Jermanism. We shall trumpet its arrival as we spill over the Himalayan Plateau or South into the Darjeeling and beyond, for it is now our turn to spread our wings and soar towards the Red Sun."

However, a small but dedicated group led by the Agrarian Syndicalist Helen Lepcha and the Socialist freedom fighter Trilochan Pokhrel has also come here to our Sikkim, and with Jerman Lepcha tiring of power, these Indian exiles have risen to carry Jerman’s torch. Though Jerman shall stay in power as a symbol of unity, they shall blaze their own direction behind him, but Jerman has assured the people that they are in good hands. It would seem that even when the Indians fail, they can still win out in Sikkim."

skm_socialist_secularism_desc:0 "Though moves were made to limit the influence of the clergy when Jerman first took power, many believe that his initial actions did not go far enough in fully limiting the power of the Buddhists from intervening in politics. As such, a policy of total state Secularism shall be enforced, fully divorcing the needs of the Church from the functions of Sikkim’s government. Though people will still be free to practice their religions as they please, and though the monasteries shall still stay open, they will all do so without support from the state."

Though we cannot fully remove or eradicate these meddling elites without eroding our culture or greatly losing mass support, we can strip them of all political power and special privileges like we did with the nobles and royals, putting them on equal ground as the rest of the masses."

Taking this new ideology to heart, Jerman has begun to shift the course of our revolution towards one far more agreeable to the Buddhist clergy and citizens within our state. By fusing Buddhist theology with Bolshevik-inspired Socialism while including Jerman’s own ideas of communalism and Democratic Eco-Socialism, we shall truly create a holy and perfect proletarian paradise here in our valley of heaven and rice."

Many are eager to have a new untouched land to implement their Socialist theories and dreams, and so Socialist volunteers have begun to arrive in droves, while those that can’t come themselves have sent supplies, equipment, and funding instead.

All shall be included in this identity, regardless of what they may do in the privacy of their own homes or shrines, and we shall slowly show them all the true way so that each of them comes to accept and embrace this new identity in the future.

As such, we have moved to re-crown the Chogyals of the Namgyal Dynasty as the temporal link between Sikkim and the heavens and cosmos, who Jerman shall rule through along with the Living Buddha, the 16th Karmapa. Together with Jerman Lepcha and the teachings of Roerich and Lenin, we shall build a pious Theocratic-Monarchist dual government supported by the vaguely anarchist and egalitarian Democratic Eco-Socialist ideas of Jerman Lepcha and the Esoteric Leninist and radical Buddhist ideas of Roerich."

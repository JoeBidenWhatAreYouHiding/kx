VEN_secure_bogota:0 "Securing Bogotá"

VEN_blackmonday:0 "Black Monday hits the Oil Wells"
VEN_blackmonday_desc:0 "Dios Mio! With the majority of our foreign trade being with Germany, it was inevitable that their economic crisis would reach us. For now, we must deal with the immediate consequences as panic spreads amongst the people of Caracas."

VEN_democracy_prevails:0 "Democracy Prevails"
VEN_democracy_prevails_desc:0 "Calm has returned in cities across Venezuela. Now, we can properly focus on the path to economic recovery, especially as the workers have been hit quite hard by the ongoing crisis."
VEN_welfare_program:0 "Welfare Programs"
VEN_welfare_program_desc:0 "It would be a mistake to cut welfare when the people needs it the most. In fact, we must ensure that our welfare programs can reach as many Venezuelans as possible while they are vulnerable."
VEN_healthcare_education:0 "Expand Healthcare and Education"
VEN_healthcare_education_desc:0 "Healthcare and education are the most basic and necessary institutions provided by the state and we must ensure that they are able to reach the people. Ensuring that our people remains healthy and educated is the best thing we can do for future generations, for the long-term benefits are obvious even in these trying times."
VEN_expand_pensions:0 "Expand Pensions"
VEN_expand_pensions_desc:0 "The people that are unable to work, such as seniors and disabled, are the most vulnerable during disasters. Thus, in order to maintain stability and keep people happy, we should expand the pensions system so that more poor Venezuelans can access it."
VEN_indreseach:0 "Industrial Investments"
VEN_indreseach_desc:0 "As a key step in both recovering from the crisis and reducing our dependence on the oil industry, the state needs to invest in different industrial sectors, ensuring their growth and ability to employ more people."
VEN_flexibilty:0 "Economic Flexibility"
VEN_flexibilty_desc:0 "The current crisis has shown that we cannot remain dependent on the petroleum industry. As such, we must make our economy more flexible and able to adapt to the changing global economy by diversifying it. This will, hopefully, make our economy stronger and more resilient to economic fluctuations."
VEN_diversification2:0 "Industrial Diversification"
VEN_diversification2_desc:0 "Diversifying our industry is a costly and slow process, but will ensure that the Venezuelan economy can continue to grow at a healthy rate safe from market fluctuations.

VEN_preventive_coup:0 "Preventive Coup"
VEN_preventive_coup_desc:0 "With the AD government unable to maintain order, the Venezuelan Army has stepped in to restore order and guide the economy towards recovery. This is temporary, of course, as the Provisional Government insists that the scheduled elections in 1939 will still happen."
VEN_defensecontracts:0 "Defence Contracts"
VEN_defensecontracts_desc:0 "As a way to help the economy, the government is issuing more contracts to supply the military with goods.

VEN_diversification1:0 "Weapons Industry Expansion"
VEN_diversification1_desc:0 "Venezuela's military industry is, frankly, tiny. Especially compared to the size of its military. Demand for military goods such as arms and ammunition may be artificial, but it keeps people working, paid, and buying. Besides, keeping the army well-equiped will help avoid repeating their poor showing in 1925."
VEN_diversification3:0 "Army Goods Self Sufficiency"
VEN_diversification3_desc:0 "The less dependent we are on arms imports the better. Especially as the global situation continue to spiral out of control. Since we may not be able to continue importing, we may as well expand our local military industry and substitute imports."
VEN_cut_welfare:0 "Welfare Cuts"

VEN_propagandaeffort_desc:0 "While our coup was not without precedent, it did make the political opposition, especially those formerly in government beforehand, are wary about the erosion of democratic institutions. We must ensure that the people understand the temporary character of our government and that the scheduled elections are maintained."

VEN_inf:0 "Emergency Infrastructure Works"
VEN_inf_desc:0 "As a temporary measure to put people back to work, the government has begun a program of infrastructure work. This will not only give paid work for the workless, but will also improve the infrastructure network of Venezuela, bringing the country closer together."
VEN_milinf:0 "Airport Construction Effort"

VEN_1939_elections_desc:0 "Despite the economic crisis, the scheduled election will still be held. The Acción Democrática will attempt to win a new term, but the Unión Republicana Democrática has a good chance of taking over, focusing on economic prosperity and nationalist rhetoric. However, the syndicalist PSV has been growing since Black Monday, and have a small chance at a surprise victory with their anti-capitalist rhetoric."

VEN_longtermplanning_desc:0 "If we are to have a successful, prosperous economy, we must focus on long-term economic goals rather than short-term ones. This will create a healthy and stable economy rather than a bubble that will inevitably burst."
VEN_thedutchdisease:0 "Dealing with the Dutch Disease"
VEN_thedutchdisease_desc:0 "It is no secret that, despite our efforts for the past decade, Venezuela is addicted to black gold. Now that we have successfully secured our mandate, we can focus on diversifying our economy even further and reduce our dependence on the oil industry as much as possible to ensure sustainable growth."
VEN_blackmondaysafe:0 "Safety from Market Fluctuations"

VEN_oil_expansion:0 "Oil Expansion"

### Events ###
ven.1.t:0 "Venezuela's place in the world"
ven.1.d:0 "After Venezuela split from Gran Colombia in 1830, the country was rocked by a number of civil wars between conservative and liberals until the country was federalised in 1864. However, Venezuela still struggled to maintain stability through a number of intermittent military and civilian governments. What changed this was the discovery of oil deposits and General Juan Vicente 'The Catfish' Gómez's coup in 1908. Under Gómez, the petroleum industry became the nation's economic foundation and remained relatively stable through the Weltkrieg, staying neutral in the conflict and reducing the country's debt, albeit at the cost of making the country completely dependent on oil. The Catfish's regime could only last so long, however. After failing to successfully push for Venezuela's claims on Essequibo due to American intervention as the British Empire practically collapsed, he was deposed by the military in 1928 after a scandal with British 'Reparations' and the Generación del 1926 soon formed a democratic government after elections were held. By 1936, however, the Generación has grown heavily divided between three parties. Acción Democrática currently holds the reins of government, but their former liberal allies in the Unión Democrática Republicana are gaining momentum while the Internationale-aligned Partido Socialista de Venezuela continues to foment anti-capitalist dissent. Nevertheless, Venezuela is one of the few relatively stable and democratic nations in the region, but escalating tensions around the globe could easily destabilize the nascent democracy."
ven.1.a:0 "We do live in interesting times."

ven.2.t:0 "Instability in Caracas"
ven.2.d:0 "With news of the collapse of the Berlin Stock Market reaching Venezuela and already affecting the economy, there have been numerous disturbances in Caracas and other cities as a run to the banks led to protests and riots. Many in the military believe that the Socialist Party is behind many of these disturbances and plan to use them to start a revolution in Venezuela. Eleazar López Contreras, one of the generals that helped restore democracy back in 1928, is ready to step in once again should the current government fail to restore order, but [Root.GetLeader] insists that the police can handle the excesses and things will settle down soon."
ven.2.a:0 "The government restores calm."
ven.2.b:0 "A temporary Junta seizes power."

ven.3.t:0 "The 1939 Presidential Election"
ven.3.d:0 "Despite the crises caused by Black Monday, the presidential election scheduled for this year is still happening and the campaigning has been fierce as a result. The social-democratic Acción Democrática has a good chance of securing another term, promising to continue their policy of welfare expansion and industrial diversification. The social-liberal Unión Republicana Democrática, the other moderate party born from the Generación del 1926, also has a good chance of taking the presidency through promises of economic prosperity and use of nationalist rhetoric. Finally, while their chances are relatively low, the Internationale-aligned Partido Socialista de Venezuela has, surprisingly enough, been seriously campaigning, using Black Monday to push their radical anti-capitalist and socialist ideology."

ven.4.d:0 "It has come to attention that a coalition of Internationale-aligned parties have taken over the Venezuelan government after an election. While we certainly cannot accept such a hostile ideology gaining ground in our backyard, we have been approached by a group of Venezuelan officers, led by General Marcos Pérez Jiménez, for our support as they wish to oust their newly-elected socialist government that threaten their and, as they reminded us, our interests."
ven.4.a:0 "Support their coup and secure our interests."
ven.4.b:0 "A waste of our resources."

ven.5.t:0 "Marcos Pérez Jiménez seizes power!"
ven.5.d:0 "It appears that the socialist government had not only internal, but external enemies as well. General Pérez Jiménez, with support from many officers and the army, have seized power in a bloody coup to stop the PSV's revolutionary policies. After a brief showdown with a hastily-assembled militia loyal to the PSV, the army arrested a number of PSV politicians and blocked access to the Palacio Legislativo. Within a couple of days, Pérez Jiménez's supporters have secured the country and PSV leaders have either fled or in hiding. It appears that the United States of America is behind this."
ven.5.a:0 "The Junta Nacional will save us from Syndicalism."

ven.6.t:0 "Importing Small Arms"
ven.6.d.a:0 "Because of how limited our domestic arms industry is, we are still reliant on foreign producers.

ven.7.b:0 "We can't spare any arms."

ven.8.t:0 "Small Arms Shipment"

ven.9.t:0 "The 'Fifty-to-Fifty' Law"
ven.9.d:0 "President [VEN.GetLeader] has just signed into law a bill that will reduce the profit foreign governments make off Venezuelan oil. Termed the 'fifty-to-fifty' law, the bill will allow the government to take half of the proceeds generated by foreign drilling in Venezuela. This is a great step towards economic independence, and many have lauded the government for this action."

ven.11.t:0 "Black Monday hits the Oil Wells!"
ven.11.d:0 "Venezuela's economy has been in a golden age since the discovery of our rich oil wells. The hungry industries of Europe, America and Japan have long bought all the oil they could afford. However, after the crash, things went sideways alarmingly, if unsurprisingly, quickly. Oil prices plummeted, and state revenue too. Soon basic services will suffer, and President [Root.GetLeader] will have to act before it is too late."
ven.11.a:0 "Catastrophic!"

ven.12.t:0 "Importing Artillery"
ven.12.d.a:0 "Because of the limited size of our arms industry, heavy weapons and equipment such as artillery pieces are difficult to come by.

Both of these companies offer the quantity of big guns we need at a price we can afford and have the best reputation."

Until our military industry is up to date, we must import them. Our French and British comrades do produce enough high-quality guns and will hopefully be able to spare some to protect the revolution in Venezuela."
ven.19.d.b:0 "It appears that our first choice is unable to supply us with the quantity of artillery pieces we requested. Thankfully, we have a second option who are hopefully able and willing to sell us much-needed guns to the Venezuelan Army."
ven.19.d.c:0 "Clearly, these foreign companies are not to be trusted as we feared. We will have to make due with local arms production or acquire them in some other way."
ven.19.a:0 "Ask our French comrades."
ven.19.b:0 "Ask the revolutionary British."
ven.19.c:0 "We couldn't trust them after all."

ven.20.t:0 "Acquiring Surplus Fighters"
ven.20.d.a:0 "The aviation industry in Venezuela is practically non-existent, but aircraft have been already proven to be an integral part of modern warfare. Our French and British comrades, or even the revolutionaries in America, may be able to supply us with some aircrafts to help us build up our air force."
ven.20.d.b:0 "Our first choice for surplus aircraft is unable to provide us with the equipment we requested. Thankfully, we have an alternative to fall back to and we can only hope that they will prove more willing than the first."
ven.20.d.c:0 "It appears that we have ran out of options as the main players in the aeronautics industry are either unavailable to us or unwilling to spare us surplus aircraft. We will have to figure out another way to get new aircraft for our air force and to jump-start out own industry with limited help."
ven.20.a:0 "Ask our French comrades."
ven.20.b:0 "The new Americans must have surplus to spare!"
ven.20.e:0 "Ask the revolutionary British."
ven.20.c:0 "We couldn't trust them after all."

ven.21.t:0 "Alliance with the USA"
ven.21.d:0 "It is no secret that since General Pérez Jiménez's coup that Venezuela is aligned with the USA. Now that the former has formalised the League of American States, we can join this alliance and formalise our close ties with the United States of America."
ven.21.a:0 "The USA is our greatest ally."

ven.22.t:0 "Opposition Organises in Venezuela"
ven.22.d:0 "Last week, an armory was raided and hundreds of weapons stolen. Unsurprisingly, today, we received news that opponents to our government have been organising under the safety of Venezuela's reactionary regime. While we have no proof, we suspect that these disgruntled traitors are responsible for stealing Colombian Army rifles and smuggling them to Venezuela, preparing an insurrection."
ven.22.a:0 "We must stay vigilant."

ven.23.t:0 "Venezuela Prepares for War"
ven.23.d:0 "As we suspected, the reactionary Venezuelans have been preparing to overthrow our government. Not only have they been arming Colombian traitors in their country, but we have received intelligence reports that they are mobilising their forces and preparing to invade us."
ven.23.a:0 "They won't take an inch of Colombian land."

ven.24.t:0 "An Ultimatum From Caracas"
ven.24.d:0 "The Venezuelans have claimed the region west of the Essequibo River in Guyana since independence from Spain, even though in 1899 it was decided by the United States that the territory would remain British. Caracas never gave up however, and now Venezuela seems to have taken advantage of our fight against the British to make territorial demands on Guyana. They have declared that we have forty-eight hours to evacuate the territory before their troops move in, and woe to any of our personnel left at that time. This is a ridiculous demand, and it is clear that we will have to defend Guyana against the treacherous Venezuelans once more."
ven.24.a:0 "We must prepare for war. There is no other choice."

ven.25.t:0 "[CAF.GetNameDefCap] Refuses our Ultimatum"
ven.25.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the perfidious, stubborn Anglos have refused to cede the occupied territory of Guyana Esequiba. It appears that we will have to retake it by force. All patriotic Venezuelans celebrate today as we move in to reclaim what is ours."
ven.25.a:0 "We shall retake our rightful lands!"

ven.26.t:0 "Colombian Volunteers Return Home"
ven.26.d:0 "With their homeland liberated, the volunteers we armed to ovethrow the oppressive syndicalist regime in Colombia have been disbanded and they have returned home, decorated and honoured."
ven.26.a:0 "Their service will be remembered."

ven.27.t:0 "Venezuela Purchases Shares in our Oil Industry"
ven.27.d:0 "Our petroleum industry controls a huge portion of Venezuela's oil. In an attempt to acquire a larger portion of the profits generated by their resources, the Venezuelan government has bought a larger share of our oil assets in their country."
ven.27.a:0 "Such is the Free Market."

ven.28.t:0 "Venezuela Seizes our Oil Assets"
ven.28.d:0 "As we are unable to protect our assets oversears, the Venezuelan government has taken advantage of our precarious situation and has seized our oil assets in their country. While this is a loss for [Root.GetAdjective] companies, there is nothing we can do to stop them."
ven.28.a:0 "Damned Vultures!"

ven.29.t:0 "The 1944 Presidential Election"
ven.29.d:0 "As our constitution dictates, five years have elapsed since the last election and it is time for a new one. The Acción Democrática and Unión Republicana Democrática are still the main contender, while the Partio Socialista de Venezuela remains dedicated to the destruction of the bourgeois system through the system itself."
ven.29.a:0 "AD secures another term."
ven.29.b:0 "URD wins the presidency."
ven.29.c:0 "PSV achieves a revolution-by-ballot."

ven.30.t:0 "The 1949 Presidential Election"
ven.30.d:0 "As our constitution dictates, five years have elapsed since the last election and it is time for a new one. The Acción Democrática and Unión Republicana Democrática are still the main contender, while the Partio Socialista de Venezuela remains dedicated to the destruction of the bourgeois system through the system itself."
ven.30.a:0 "AD secures another term."
ven.30.b:0 "URD wins the presidency."
ven.30.c:0 "PSV achieves a revolution-by-ballot."

ven.31.t:0 "The 1954 Presidential Election"
ven.31.d:0 "As our constitution dictates, five years have elapsed since the last election and it is time for a new one. The Acción Democrática and Unión Republicana Democrática are still the main contender, while the Partio Socialista de Venezuela remains dedicated to the destruction of the bourgeois system through the system itself. This time, however, a conservative party has entered the fray: The Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente."
ven.31.a:0 "AD secures another term."
ven.31.b:0 "URD wins the presidency."
ven.31.c:0 "PSV achieves a revolution-by-ballot."
ven.31.e:0 "COPEI, the newcomers, wins."

ven.32.t:0 "The 1959 Presidential Election"
ven.32.d:0 "As our constitution dictates, five years have elapsed since the last election and it is time for a new one. The Acción Democrática and Unión Republicana Democrática are still the main contender, with COPEI in third, while the Partio Socialista de Venezuela remains dedicated to the destruction of the bourgeois system through the system itself."
ven.32.a:0 "AD secures another term."
ven.32.b:0 "URD wins the presidency."
ven.32.c:0 "PSV achieves a revolution-by-ballot."
ven.32.e:0 "COPEI, the newcomers, wins."

ven.33.t:0 "Venezuela in the Internationale?"
ven.33.d:0 "Venezuela, against all odds, has recently elected a syndicalist government and has made great strides towards a peaceful revolution. Now that they are stable, they wish to help us in our war against the reactionaries."
ven.33.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
ven.33.b:0 "How are we supposed to help them? Swim?"

ven.34.t:0 "France Accepts us into the Internationale"
ven.34.d:0 "Good news! France has decided to welcome us into the revolutionary brotherhood of nations."
ven.34.a:0 "¡Proletarios de todos los países, uníos!"

ven.35.t:0 "France Refuses"
ven.35.d:0 "For some reason, the Commune of France has refused our offer to join them in their crusade against the reactionaries."
ven.35.a:0 "¿Qué?"

ven.36.t:0 "Venezuela in the Entente?"
ven.36.d:0 "It seems Venezuela is engaged in a state of war with the Syndicalists of the Third Internationale. Though we have had uneasy relations with the Venezuelans since the crises of 1895 and then 1902, they have reached out to the British Empire to protect them from the red menace of the Communards. However this strange turn of events has come to pass, Venezuela, with her vast oil reserves and strategic position, could prove a valuable ally in the fight against syndicalism. Some members of Parliament, however, have argued against involving ourselves in a foreign conflict. Other PMs argue that if we wish to be the protector of the Western Hemisphere in place of the failing United States, we need to intervene. What should we do?"
ven.36.a:0 "Welcome to the Entente, Venezuela."
ven.36.b:0 "We do not need the liability."

ven.37.t:0 "Canada Accepts Us into the Entente"
ven.37.d:0 "Good news! Canada has decided to allow us into their alliance. We shall now drive the Syndicalists out of the Caribbean and beyond together!"
ven.37.a:0 "God Save the King, then!"

ven.38.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
ven.38.d:0 "For some reason, Canada has refused our request for an alliance. We shall fight alone."
ven.38.a:0 "¿Qué?"

ven.39.t:0 "Peace with Venezuela?"
ven.39.d:0 "We have been pushed out of Guyana, and our forces have failed to make a beachhead near their capital. It is clear to us we are losing this war, and it is clear to the Venezuelans too. They have offered us peace, demanding only the claimed regions of Guyana to the Essequibo River. Should we take their offer of peace, or fight until the bitter end?"
ven.39.a:0 "Take your damn jungle, Venezuela."
ven.39.b:0 "We shall never surrender!"

ven.40.t:0 "Victory in Guyana!"
ven.40.d:0 "The West Indians have agreed to our offer of peace. Guyana Esequiba is ours once again, and will remain part of Venezuela forevermore! All over the country, the people are united in their patriotism - though there may be some trouble with the new territories, where our administrators report there is nary a Spanish-speaker to be found. Nevertheless, this is a great day for all Venezuelans!"
ven.40.a:0 "¡Dios y Federación!"

ven.41.t:0 "The West Indians Refuse Peace"
ven.41.d:0 "[CAF.GetNameDefCap] have treacherously refused our generous peace deal. They have once again declared they will never cede Guyana Esequiba to us, and so the war must carry on. Some in our government are privately wondering if we can truly win a drawn-out conflict, but the people are, for now, committed to go on."
ven.41.a:0 "Damn Anglos!"

ven.42.t:0 "The Venezuelan Government Offers Alliance"
ven.42.d:0 "In the aftermath of our peaceful intervention in the troubled republic of Venezuela, stability has finally been restored under President Marcos Pérez Jiménez. In order to maintain the health and prestige of his regime, he has asked us to join with him in making a formal treaty of alliance and aid. Since we are part of a greater alliance, the [ROOT.GetFactionName], we will need to ask the leading country of our alliance if they would be willing to protect Venezuela. Since we will be doing most of the heavy lifting in protecting them, however, there is no reason to refuse."
ven.42.a:0 "Pass on the request to our ally."
ven.42.b:0 "We don't want the Venezuelans."

ven.43.t:0 "America Forwards Venezuelan Alliance Request"
ven.43.d:0 "Our American allies have received a request from Venezuela to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName]. The United States seems interested in bringing their southern neighbor into its sphere, and has encouraged us to accept. While Venezuela would provide us with a stable oil supply and a base in the southern Caribbean, allying them risks entanglement in South American politics. Should we allow them to join?"
ven.43.a:0 "Naturally they are welcome!"
ven.43.b:0 "It would be too much of a liability."

ven.44.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts the Venezuelan Offer"
ven.44.d:0 "Our allies in [FROM.GetName] have accepted our request that Venezuela be allowed to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName]. Our reputation as the most influential country in the Americas has been reinforced, and we have a firm new ally to boot."
ven.44.a:0 "Great!"

ven.45.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Alliance"
ven.45.d.america:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our request to join their global alliance, the [FROM.GetFactionName]. This is a great day for international cooperation, and a day that signals the coming death of worldwide radicalism and socialism!"
ven.45.d:0 "Our request for an alliance was forwarded by the Americans to the the faraway nation of [FROM.GetName], and they have accepted our request to join their global alliance, the [FROM.GetFactionName]. This is a great day for international cooperation, and a day that signals the coming death of worldwide radicalism and socialism!"
ven.45.a:0 "To friendship!"

ven.46.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
ven.46.d:0 "Although the Americans had clearly already shown their willingness to help us, their alliance has proved less friendly. Our offer of alliance has been rebuffed, on the grounds that we might drag them into wars with our neighbors. This is a national outrage, and has shaken our popularity with the people."
ven.46.a:0 "We were foolish to trust the imperialists."

ven.47.t:0 "A 'Civilian' Government?"
ven.47.d:0 "After seizing power in the wake of a potential socialist revolution by ballot, President Jiménez has entrenched the military's rule over Venezuela. Despite our successes, our detractors have protested against our suspension of democracy. To solve this 'issue', President Jiménez has sought out parties who are willing to support our government. One such figure is Germán Borregales, leader of the fringe National Action Movement. Borregales had broken off from the Christian democrats of COPEI to promote a more fervent anti-socialist, nationalist, and Catholic movement. Borregales' role as president would only be symbolic as Jiménez would still hold ultimate authority over the government. Some officers, however, fear that associating ourselves with this madman would do us more harm than good."
ven.47.a:0 "Invite MAN to be the face of our junta."
ven.47.b:0 "We have saved the nation, there is no need to cower behind parties."

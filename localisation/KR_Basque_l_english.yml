### Focuses ###
Basque_focus:0 "Basque Focus Tree"

 
BAS_Freedom:0 "Cry of Freedom over Euskadi"
BAS_Freedom_desc:0 "For as long as any of us remember, the Spanish flag has hung over the lands of Euskadi, keeping Basques chained to their dying empire. When the Republic was proclaimed four years ago, we expected the more liberal Spaniards to honour our customs, but that project was a short-lived and chaotic disaster, and only brought back the harsh military rule that again stomped on our independence. The new king claimed to bring more freedoms to us, but spat in our face with the rejection of the reforms. We have taken matters into our own hands, and while the future is uncertain, Basques have finally removed the shackle of Madrid."
 
BAS_Utilize_Industry_in_Bilbao:0 "Utilize Industry in Bilbao"
BAS_Utilize_Industry_in_Bilbao_desc:0 "Bilbao, our largest settlement, has long been a developing city. Its factories and mills churn out products day and night, everything from weapons to ships to civilian goods. The provisional government has decided to enact emergency nationalisation of these factories to supply us with everything we need to stop a potential Spanish invasion into our lands."
 
BAS_Iron_Ring_of_Bilbao:0 "Iron Ring of Bilbao"
BAS_Iron_Ring_of_Bilbao_desc:0 "The Iron Ring of Bilbao is a set of fortifications and bunkers around the entire Basque territory that was originally meant to defend our lands from possible Communard invasion, but our government has expanded it secretly for years now in case Spain would ever fall into a situation where we could proclaim independence. While nowhere near complete, these labyrinthine constructions could shelter our soldiers and civilians alike should the enemy over the border seek to threaten our freedom."
 
BAS_Empty_The_Warehouses:0 "Loot Guns"
BAS_Empty_The_Warehouses_desc:0 "The Spanish Guardia Civil had many of its troops posted on our lands, and the border with France was manned by some of Spain’s most loyal soldiers. When Alfonso was shot, these troops scrambled for the heartlands of Spain, and only a skeleton crew was left behind to keep us in check, a garrison that we easily defeated when our revolt began. There remains many guns and other weapons in storage, left by the Spaniards, and it would be a sin to leave them to rust in the warehouses. Basque patriots will put them to good use against their former owners."
 
BAS_Raise_The_Ertzana:0 "Raise the Ertzana"
BAS_Raise_The_Ertzana_desc:0 "Ertzana is the local police force of Basques hastily established from those native Guardia Asalto and Guardia Civil troops, who were present here when the instability and chaos engulfed Spain. While merely a militia by the standards of national militaries, these policemen are willing to die for our country and must serve as a first line of defence as we create a proper military force."
 
BAS_Expand_the_Iron_Ring:0 "Expand the Iron Ring"
BAS_Expand_the_Iron_Ring_desc:0 "The government of Euskadi has seen it fit to utilize volunteer tradesmen gathered from both our main parties of EAJ and EAE but also from the trade union ELA to further extend the Iron ring of Bilbao. We cannot build quite as strong fortifications in this short timespan as the main body of the Iron Ring has, but every bunker and trench helps in this difficult situation."
 
BAS_The_Great_Enemy_Falters:0 "The Great Enemy Falters!"
BAS_The_Great_Enemy_Falters_desc:0 "The Spanish, still struggling to keep their bloated carcass of former empire over the water, could have most likely squashed us in direct confrontation initially, but thanks to the emergency measures enacted by our government, we were able to produce strong enough defences to deter our former masters from attacking Euskadi."
 
BAS_Euzko_Gudariak:0 "Euzko Gudariak"
BAS_Euzko_Gudariak_desc:0 "We can no longer rely solely on the Ertzana, as modern warfare requires more than militias and police forces. The first Basque army, Euzko Gudarostea, will be formed to protect our nation from external threats, though as we are essentially building the national army from scratch, there are a lot of questions as to which famous military force to model our army on. Similarly, questions about heavy weapons, standardized equipment and transportation must be discussed, and the best strategic outlook decided upon. Still, both the men and new army leadership seem enthusiastic about the task at hand, and the generous budget given is likely to keep the spirits high."
 
BAS_Cover_the_Basics:0 "Eibar's Master Weaponsmiths"
BAS_Cover_the_Basics_desc:0 "Spain was never considered the greatest manufacturer of weapons, but nonetheless the nation spawned many famous weaponsmiths and manufactories. Some of the most famous of these are now under our rule, especially the pistol crafters of Llama and Star. Star, known for the copy of the legendary Colt Model 1911, has also recently started working on a submachine gun, which we hope could prove to be a new standard weapon for Basque police forces and military personnel. However, given the needs of our fledgling military, these two companies will need to step into the production of rifles and machine guns as well, though the lucrative contract money from the government will most likely make this shift in production less of a hassle for these companies."
 
BAS_Every_Man_a_Guerilla:0 "Glorification of the Gudari"
BAS_Mobilize_BASuts_desc:0 "Gudaris, Basque militants, have arrived in droves to the recruitment offices after the independence, and this is hardly a surprise given our situation, wedged between far stronger powers. We must utilize this new patriotic fervor to provide military training to as many Basques as possible. We do not have a massive population base, which means that every man must be trained rigorously. When it comes to our Gudaris, each must be comparable to the professional armies of other armies."
 
BAS_Remembering_the_Cause:0 "Defense Board Planning for the Inevitable"
BAS_Remembering_the_Cause_desc:0 "We must save our people, and the only way to truly do that is through steel. Weapons and machines of war must be produced, new guns and artillery created, and more soldiers trained and deployed. Only through readiness for war can we truly be saved, for war is an eternal and harsh fact of life, and the only way to truly ready ourselves is to ensure we have more guns than we know what to do with."
 
BAS_Spy_on_our_Enemies:0 "Bilbao's Armoured Peacekeepers"
BAS_Spy_on_our_Enemies_desc:0 "Warfare is, despite traditional notions to the contrary, not a glorious act performed between gentlemen. It’s a harsh, brutal and ruthless set of decisions and actions meant to maximize one force’s domination over the other. Our nation is small, its population limited and its terrain rough. We cannot rely on military prowess and bravery alone when it comes to tackling our enemies, but instead the Eusko Gudarostea must invest into more unorthodox ways of waging war. Specialists will be trained to work as spies and infiltrators. These men and women will use subterfuge and sabotage to harm our enemies, gather intelligence and corrupt their military and political institutions from the inside. While highly dangerous, this backhanded strategy is needed to give us any edge in potential wars with our neighbours."
 
BAS_Mendigoizale_Culture:0 "Benefits of the Mendigoixale Culture"
BAS_Mendigoizale_Culture_desc:0 "Due to our location near the Pyrenees, Basques have developed into natural mountaineers, living alongside these vast behemoths of nature. But throughout the last decades, this mountaineering culture has evolved from a way to exercise and enjoy nature into a form of political gatherings. Mendigoizales were clubs formed by EAJ to gather Basque nationalists and hold meetings in the less inhabited areas of the Pyrenees, away from watchful Spanish authorities. This culture has meant that many of our military leaders and soldiers are masters of the mountains, something we can capitalize on by forming men with Mendigoizale experience into proper mountaineering units. They will keep our forces safe from any invasion the Spanish or French could attempt in the Pyrenean regions of our nation."
 
BAS_The_Legend_of_Basque_Sailors:0 "From Sea Police to True Marines"
BAS_The_Legend_of_Basque_Sailors_desc:0 "Basques are a seafaring people, our sailors have long travelled around the Atlantic and North Sea in search of whales and fish and our dockyards are some of the finest in Iberia. But while our navy takes its first few steps in the world, our military leadership has proposed that we utilize our naval traditions in the formation of a marine unit, capable of both serving as coast guards during peace time and naval military force during war time. While this unit will likely need to be small at first, our commanders hope that the experience gained from its formation will help us create similar units in the future and better theorize how they are to be used in conjunction with our navy."
 
BAS_Army_of_Fervent_Believers:0 "True Officer Corps of Euskadi"
BAS_Army_of_Fervent_Believers_desc:0 "Our men are brave and diligent in their duty, but the painful reality is that we will never match our neighbours in manpower. As such, our best hope against these overwhelming odds is to rely on the strengths and peculiarities of Basque society. If one were to spend even a single day in our cities or villages, the influence of Catholicism on our lives would become apparent in very short order. As such, our leadership feels that an introduction of special military chaplains meant to act as a morale boost to our soldiers. Just as priests are a very integral part of Basque social life, the chaplains shall be their equal on the military side. They will act as spiritual guides to our leaders and foot soldiers, help them in difficult times with the word of God and perform all rituals related to the life in the military, be they sermons or remembrance of those who have given their lives in the service.."
 
BAS_Secure_Our_Independence:0 "Defenders of Sovereignty"
BAS_Secure_Our_Independence_desc:0 "The Basque people have existed in this small space of Europe for millenia, and here we remain to this day. However, even the most fervent nationalist will concede that Basques have lived under the boots of others for centuries now, and had it not been for the hubris and errors made by our former overlords, we may well have continued to just be a province of Spain. But now that we have escaped our master’s grasp, the Basque patriotism must be stoked and maintained so if the time comes, our people will fight tooth and nail for our sovereignty."
 
BAS_First_Basque_Elections:0 "First Basque Elections"
BAS_First_Basque_Elections_desc:0 "The time has come to cast the ballots and define the ruler of our lands for the next few years. Most expect the hegemon of Basque politics, Euzko Alderdi Jeltzalea to come out on top, but given the influx of Spanish people into the ranks of opposing parties and the break-up of EAJ and the Solidarists, the political scene is shaping up to be far more competitive than previously thought. While political actors like the Carlists of Navarre, the anarchists of San Sebastian and the small remnant Communist presence of Bilbao have boycotted the elections, the amount of people turning up to the elections is expected to be massive. The first trial of Basque republicanism shall begin!."
 
BAS_EAS_Victory:0 "Socialist Patriots of EAS Wins the Day"
BAS_EAS_Victory_desc:0 "The local branch of Partido Socialista Obrero Espanol has officially left the wider Spanish organization to create the first truly socialist party in Basque country, Euskadiko Alderdi Sozialista. Now, the EAS is triumphant in the elections! Following a moderate but truly proletarian direction, we shall see the rise of a more equal Euskadi emerge in our victory."
 
BAS_Galvanize_the_Workers:0 "Convert Spanish Unions to the Basque Cause"
BAS_Galvanize_the_Workers_desc:0 "While most socialist unions in Basque country belonged to the EAS’ sister organization, Langileen Batasun Orokorra, there are still those that do not adhere to the big-tent socialist union. We must work to integrate them under one banner of a socialist united front."
 
BAS_Red_Nationalism:0 "Ikurriña Waved By the Basque Worker"
BAS_Red_Nationalism_desc:0 "Santiago Aznar, lehendakari of Basque socialists, is a known patriot first and a socialist second, and thanks to his suggestion, the Ikurriña flag of the Basques was officially adopted as our national symbol. Now, we must kindle a true flame of nationalism among Basque workers, reminding them that they are Basques above all else, and true fighters for the nation’s cause, not some syndicalist internationale."

BAS_Hunt_Down_Jacobins:0 "Redemption of the Remaining Communists"
BAS_Hunt_Down_Jacobins_desc:0 "Most of the communists in Basque have unfortunately been brainwashed into following the French Jacobin doctrine, forgetting the nationalist roots of all Basques. However, there are some, such as Jesus Larranaga, who still hold Euskal Herria dear in their hearts, and they should be encouraged to join the EAS out of nationalist sentiment, driving a wedge among the communists of Euskadi."
 
BAS_Reel_in_the_Anarchists:0 "Extend a Hand to Anarcho-Abertzales"
BAS_Reel_in_the_Anarchists_desc:0 "The nationalist anarchists such as Felix Likiniano might not agree with the centralized doctrine of EAS, but they are fellow left-wing nationalists, and we have the best chance out of all the Basque parties to get their support, which should be seized if possible."
 
BAS_Open_Hand_to_EAJ:0 "Cordial Relations with the Party of Arana"
BAS_Open_Hand_to_EAJ_desc:0 "While Basque socialists and conservatives rarely see eye-to-eye on economic matters, they are stalwart allies in regards to nationalist, irredentist, and cultural issues. It would be a shame to ruin this cooperation just because of ideological commitments."
 
BAS_Worker_Led_Industrialization:0 "The Example of Alfa Group's Co-Operatives"
BAS_Worker_Led_Industrialization_desc:0 "The Alfa Group is a co-operative corporation run entirely by socialists. In spite of naysayers, it has seen unprecedented success which provides a useful blueprint for the future industrialisation of Euskadi under our guidance."

BAS_Seize_ELA_From_the_Hand_of_Capitalist:0 "Expel Yellow Socialists From Unionism"
BAS_Seize_ELA_From_the_Hand_of_Capitalist_desc:0 "The capitalist bootlickers within Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna, the Catholic union associated with the Nationalist Party, have long deceived the proletariat into being docile and agreeable servants. This cannot go on any longer. We must act now to save the EAS from these influences."

BAS_Pluralist_Patriotism:0 "Pluralist Patriotism of Euskal Herria"
BAS_Pluralist_Patriotism_desc:0 "Other parties, especially Aberri and EMB, might hate the Spaniards with a burning passion, but to the EAS, they’re fellow comrades and are thus just as important as any Basque citizen. We must help bridge the gap between Spaniards and Basques for the betterment of our society."

BAS_Socialism_Under_Ikurrina:0 "Crimson Patriotism Leads Euskadi to Its Destiny"
BAS_Socialism_Under_Ikurrina_desc:0 "When the EAS first took the reins of power, conservatives and liberals alike anticipated a full socialist takeover. However, our commitment to democracy and nationalism in accordance with the vision of Santiago Aznar has dispelled these rumours. Now, us red patriots shall continue guiding Euskadi forward into a brighter and better future."

BAS_EAE_Victory:0 "Liberal Nationalists of EAE March to Victory"
BAS_EAE_Victory_desc:0 "In the early 1930s, the Eusko Abertzale Ekintza was formed as a splinter from the Nationalist conservatives of the EAJ, and has never since lost their connection to them. But now, we can finally show the benefits of our ideals and policies to the people of Euskadi, and free ourselves of the stigma of association to the Nationalists."
 
BAS_Take_the_Stray_Spaniards_In:0 "Euskadi Free of Anti-Hispanic Racism"
BAS_Take_the_Stray_Spaniards_In_desc:0 "Even if Sabino Arana, Father of Basque Nationalism, may have hated the Spaniards, we are committed to supporting the Spanish people who chose to remain here. By denouncing discrimination against Spaniards and allowing them to serve as politicians, we can gain a new demographic that will support us."
 
BAS_Mend_the_Autonomist_Divide:0 "Mend the Autonomist Schism"
BAS_Mend_the_Autonomist_Divide_desc:0 "Autonomists that were once apart of the EAE splintered from the party following a debate regarding the EAE’s relations with Spanish Republican-Socialists. However, now that Euskadi is free, perhaps we can offer an olive branch and reunite with the Autonomists."

BAS_Flirt_With_the_Internationale:0 "Flirt With the Internationale"
BAS_Flirt_With_the_Internationale_desc:0 "While we cannot outright join the Internationale, we can, at the very least, trade with them. Trade agreements with the French Basque Country must be established post-haste, supplying the Communards with goods they otherwise don’t have good access routes for."
 
BAS_Form_the_Popular_Front:0 "Popular Front Against Traditionalism"
BAS_Form_the_Popular_Front_desc:0 "Traditionalism, be it in the form of Carlists or the Aberri democrats, is a bane of Basque society as it  seeks to keep it stuck in the Middle Ages. We must form a unified front with fellow liberals and socialists to combat this threat."
 
BAS_Fund_Eusko_Ikaskuntza:0 "Fuel For the Basque Golden Era"
BAS_Fund_Eusko_Ikaskuntza_desc:0 "We are in a Basque Golden Age, with multiple new museums such as the Bilbao Museum of Fine Arts, Bilbao Symphony Orchestra and the language academy of Euskaltzaindia all creating new Basque classics or exhibiting achievements of Basque society. These efforts must be funded so that our culture can truly soar to new levels, both nationally and in the eyes of the world."
 
BAS_Secular_Rationalism:0 "Secularisation With a Compassionate Hand"
BAS_Secular_Rationalism_desc:0 "While the EAE is made up of mostly Catholics, we must realise that a modern state is a secular one. Thus, a soft, compassionate program of secularising schools and administration will be initiated, without stepping too much on the toes of the Church and its rights."

BAS_Building_a_Welfare_State_From_the_Ground_Up:0 "Forging a True Welfare State"
BAS_Building_a_Welfare_State_From_the_Ground_Up_desc:0 "Basques must embark on a long-term journey to build a true welfare state that will care for its workers, children and pensioners alike. Social security, unemployment benefits and care for the elderly will be expanded, healthcare will be modified to fit the needs of the growing populace of Euskadi, and infrastructure will be built to match these reforms, with foreign help if need be."

BAS_Destroy_the_Backbone_of_Reaction:0 "Dismantle the Citadel of Reaction"
BAS_Destroy_the_Backbone_of_Reaction_desc:0 "If Carlists in the Basque countryside are left unchecked, they will inevitably destroy the republican dream and install their own monarch to rule over the Basques. This cannot be allowed to happen, the Carlist remnants must be dismantled ruthlessly."

BAS_Splinter_Party_No_More:0 "Splinter Party No Longer!"
BAS_Splinter_Party_No_More_desc:0 "Finally, thanks to our continued efforts and reforms, no one can rightfully say that Eusko Abertzale Ekintza is a mere shadow of the Nationalist Party. We have forged our own path and reputation, representing the liberal and socialist values which will truly push Euskadi into the modern era."


BAS_EAJ_Victory:0 "The Hegemonic EAJ Maintains Its Grip"
BAS_EAJ_Victory_desc:0 "It may not come as a surprise to many, but the Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea has prevailed in the first Basque elections! With our political position firmly established, we can now guide the nation towards becoming a bastion of Christian Democracy."


BAS_Ensure_ELA_Support:0 "Fortify the Alliance with Solidarists"
BAS_Ensure_ELA_Support_desc:0 "Euski Langileen Alkartasuna is a Union which has been a longtime ally of ours, providing a great platform for political support amongst their workers. Recently, however, Syndicalist sympathisers have begun to infiltrate the Union and spread their ideals, much to our chagrin. We must bolster this alliance to ensure that the Union does not become a powerhouse of Syndicalism."
 
BAS_Sota_and_Sabino:0 "The Two Giants of Basque Nationalism"
BAS_Sota_and_Sabino_desc:0 "In discussion of recent Basque history, two names are always mentioned: Ramon de la Sota, and Sabino Arana, both of whom are considered fathers of the Basque nation in spite of their very stark differences of how Basque nationalism ought to develop. Arana was a staunch traditionalist and advocated heavily for independence, whereas de la Sota was a liberal conservative who believed that autonomy was the right path for Euskadi. In spite of these differences, it is important for us now to balance them both if we want to avoid any dissent from within our own borders."

BAS_Expand_the_Ikastolak_System:0 "Pious and Patriotic Study of the Ikastolaks"
BAS_Expand_the_Ikastolak_System_desc:0 "The Ikastolaks are an endemic system of Euskadi, introduced not only for Catholic studies, but also for teaching Basque culture and language. They have been particularly effective in ensuring the survival of the Basque identity, and now that we are no longer under the yolk of Spanish oppression, it is only natural that we fund and expand the Ikastola system across Euskadi to further cement our national identity and pride."  

BAS_Expand_Social_Welfare:0 "Paternal Welfare to the Toilers"
BAS_Expand_Social_Welfare_desc:0 "In recent years, we’ve been involved in a struggle for the approval of the working-class man against Syndicalist influences who lure them in with false promises of new freedoms. The best way that we can curtail this threat and guarantee support from our workers is by introducing new reforms to improve working conditions in accordance with paternal socialist values."

BAS_Redeeming_the_Concept_of_Republic:0 "A Shrine to Republican Spirit"
BAS_Redeeming_the_Concept_of_Republic_desc:0 "Batzokis are clubs and social meeting places that are sponsored by us where republican discussion is held - hotbeds of potential. So far, they have been a great avenue for garnering political support. It’s therefore clear that we must expand the Batzokis across Euskal Herria so we can get more Basques to embrace and learn about the glories of Republicanism with us at the helm."
 
BAS_Nationalism_without_Extremism:0 "Reject Arana's Racism"
BAS_Nationalism_without_Extremism_desc:0 "Sabino Arana was a great man in many regards, and many Basques look to him as the father of our movement. However, one of his more difficult traits was his unapologetic hatred for Spaniards. If we want to maintain relevancy in today’s world for the sake of the nation,  we must work to push this sentiment behind us before it becomes too much of a problem."

BAS_The_Women_Patriots:0 "The Other Half of Basque Nationalism"
BAS_The_Women_Patriots_desc:0 "It can’t be denied that the women of our party, the Emakume Abertzale Batza, have been a fundamental cornerstone of our political relevance. By supporting their efforts in spreading word of the party and fundraising social functions, we can further secure our position."

BAS_Deal_With_Spanish_Troublemakers:0 "Cleansing Euskadi From Spanish Monarchists"
BAS_Deal_With_Spanish_Troublemakers_desc:0 "Ever since we’ve fought and won our hard-earned independence, we have been consistently plagued by the efforts of Liga de Accion Monarquica - supporters of the Monarchy. With them and the perfidious Carlists constantly prodding in, it’s time that we strike back and rid ourselves of these threats to the nation once and for all."

BAS_The_Hegemon_Remains:0 "The Hegemon Remains!"
BAS_The_Hegemon_Remains_desc:0 "Thanks to our continued efforts and reforms, the EAJ has managed to maintain its position as the hegemon of Basque politics, just as it has before. With our status secured, it is time we move on to greater heights for Euskadi. Aurrera!"

BAS_EMB_Victory:0 "The Mountaineers Scale the Cliffs of Victory!"
BAS_EMB_Victory_desc:0 "The patriotic mountaineers of Eusko Mendigoxale Batza have have long been a mere partner organization of EAJ and later, the Aberri ultranationalists, but with the recent shift in the organization’s leadership, Elias Gallastegi, the movement’s new chief, has sought to distance it from the Aberriak and create a true party of the youthful, idealistic and patriotic mendigoxales. Their recent victory in elections has further solidified this separation, and this newcomer to the parliamentary politics of Euskadi can set its sights on creating a republic according to its radical and transformative values."
 
BAS_Modernized_Vision_of_Arana:0 "Aranaism Brought to the Modern Era"
BAS_Modernized_Vision_of_Arana_desc:0 "Sabino Arana, the father of Basque nationalism, exemplified many of the characteristics that EMB wishes of its followers. He learned the Basque language through his own means, fought tooth and nail to get domestic and international recognition of the Basque people’s struggle, worked day and night to achieve his goals and followed his own routes when it came to nationalism and linguistics, his two passions. Yet Arana was nevertheless a product of his time, and his nationalistic ideas came from a place of traditionalism and racially motivated separatism. As such, EMB cannot blindly follow his ideas, especially in regards to his Integrist ideals, as we must modify these nationalist ideas of Arana to accommodate for the new, progressive and socially conscious ideas of the Mendigoxale leadership."

BAS_Mobilize_the_Mendigoizales_desc:0 "When provisional lehendakari Aguirre contacted Elias Gallastegi and his mendigoxales on the possibility of an armed struggle to separate from Spain, the mountaineers of EMB were more than happy to comply. Trained clandestinely by Communards and Irish allies alike, the Mendigoxales would prove their worth when the Spanish forces attempted to squash Euskadi’s freedom. While EMB would suffer dearly from the war, their popularity was at an all time high, and this in turn secured the victory in elections. With Euskadi’s freedom secured, the nation may finally heal, and the Mendigoxales who fell in the battle will finally be honoured. EMB will begin a program of erecting statues and securing funding for a memorial of the fallen, including Mikel Alberdi, the first dead of the EMB during the war. Their sacrifices will be remembered by all Basques for centuries to come."

BAS_Only_Through_Sacrifice:0 "Only the Sacrifice Does Euskadi Breath Free"
BAS_Only_Through_Sacrifice_desc:0 "The mendigoxales of EMB have often been at the frontlines of Basque fight for independence, and even before the separation our members were willing to put their lives on the line for Euskadi to breath free. The doctrine of self-sacrifice, not necessarily in the sense of the loss of one’s life but more in the broader sense of willingness to suffer for the cause of Basque independence, in a similar vein to the actions of Mahatma Gandhi in India, will become a cornerstone of EMB’s program. The value of giving everything your nation will be drilled to the minds of new mendigoxales, and the sacrifices of those who came before glorified to remind the greenhorns of their duty to the Fatherland."
 
BAS_Subtle_Steer_to_the_Left:0 "The Allure of Left-Wing Nationalism"
BAS_Subtle_Steer_to_the_Left_desc:0 "The EMB may have started its existence within the structures of conservative and traditionalist nationalists, but as time has gone on, especially its leader Elias Gallastegi has began to take more and more inspiration from left-wing movements. Perhaps the strongest has been the Irish Sinn Fein party, whose representatives even visited Euskal Herria in 1924. However, given the roots of the mendigoxale movement, there are those who do not approve of this full-tilt towards the left that EMB has taken. The current status quo is a compromise, but the party could tilt towards a more nationalist direction, merely allying the left-wing patriots, or join them and fully rebrand as a economically moderate but highly nationalist syndicalist party."

However, the women’s section of EMB, Aberri Emakume Batza, has been very vocal in their support for a new addition to the Ikastolak, a system of so called Gastetxus, which will serve as to reinforce patriotic and cultural education among Basque youth by teaching them traditional songs, dances and expanding the teaching of Euskara beyond what the schools can provide. EMB must support this initiative wholeheartedly."
 
BAS_Nationalization_Through_Respect:0 "Nationalization Through Respect and Dignity"
BAS_Nationalization_Through_Respect_desc:0 "If the Basques are to remove the cancer of Spanishness from our society, they must get rid of foreign ideas as well. This is especially true with capitalism, which was forced upon our traditional society by the Spaniards in the last century. It does not belong here, and we must ensure that no plunderer or soft-handed parasite remains to extract our resources and labour from the nation, only to give nothing back. Of course, just because some capitalists are little more than exploiters, it doesn’t mean that every landowner, factory boss or entrepreneur is. Nonetheless, without complete dismantling of these structures that enable inequality, Euskadi is bound to become a mirror image of Spain, struck with wealth disparities. Wide-scale nationalization, with compensation to Basque people and none for the Spaniards, will be enacted country-wide, so the grip of capitalism may be gone forevermore."

BAS_Just_Catholic_Basques:0 "Just and Pious Republic of Artisans and Farmers"

For the mendigoxales, the importance of a truly just society, guided by the values of Catholic church and organized primarily by the people on the ground, working on the farms, factories and other places of employment. To the EMB, the role of the state is to mainly facilitate the shift towards this direction and ensure that the transition goes smoothly, not to lord over the Basque people like the Spanish monarchs or military did. The end goal is to achieve a republic of farmers, artisans and workers, toiling in unison as a community for the betterment of Euskal Herria as a whole."

BAS_Crushing_Capitalist_Hoarders:0 "No Tolerance to Capitalist Pilferers"
BAS_Crushing_Capitalist_Hoarders_desc:0 "The Spanish robber barons within Euskadi have spent centuries building their little oligarchy through various means, be they turning other Basques around to join their groups or utilizing political machines such as the caciquismo to achieve their rule through grift, bribery and coercion. Whatever the means, these leeches do not benefit our society in any way, and the sooner they are removed the better it is for our national cohesion. Spaniards from the rank-and-file worker base have nothing to fear, but the vipers among their midst who still harbour ideas of supporting a Spanish reclamation of our lands will meet a swift end or the walls of a prison soon enough."

BAS_The_Height_of_Our_Power_desc:0 "The victory of EMB represented a truly massive shift in the politics of Euskal Herria, and the nation has been waiting with bated breath what the nationalists of the party have in store. The party’s fierce rhetoric and radical transformation of economy, education and administration has been welcomed by many who saw EAJ’s internal bickering and upholding of the status quo as limiting, and the party’s strong connections to the left-wing patriots has made them popular bridge between the nationalists and socialists of Euskadi. While the party must continue its project of modernization onwards for years to come to truly fulfill their planned vision of Euskadi, what has been done thus far has been an unexpected but not entirely unwelcome change of pace in the somewhat stagnant local political scene."


BAS_Aberri_Victory:0 "Hardliner Aranaists of Aberri Defeat the Odds"
BAS_Aberri_Victory_desc:0 "The brother of Sabino Arana, Luis Arana, was always seen as a gadfly within the EAJ party, willing to burn bridges with the rest of Basque nationalists if they strayed from what he considered the true vision of his brother. Thus, it was not exactly a surprise when Luis Arana announced that he would run as part of a new party Eusko Alderdi Aberri, usually just shortened to Aberri or the Fatherlanders. Aberri follows the most orthodox line of Aranaism, heavily tied to the Integrist ideas of its founder, espousing a belief of Basque racial purity over the Spaniards and highly critical of the moderate and capitalist EAJ or the socialists of EAS and EAE. Luis Arana’s party was not expected to win the elections, as his wing of the EAJ had long been on the decline, but it would seem that the Carlists flocked to the banner of Aberri after the banning of the Traditionalist Communion. For the first time since the 1920s, the Aranaist vision will guide Euskadi to greatness."
 
BAS_Republican_Traditionalism:0 "Traditionalism Without a Crown"
BAS_Republican_Traditionalism_desc:0 "The Arana brothers came from a family of Carlists, and remained within the movement until the end of the 1800s. After a pivotal moment in Luis Arana’s life, he came to view himself as a Basque instead of a Spaniard, and after a debate between the brothers, they abandoned Carlism to fully commit themselves to Basque nationalism and the cause of a free Euskadi. However, their ideals were always highly traditionalistic and the brothers adopted Integrism as a more generalistic ideology over the deeply monarchist and dynastic Carlism. Now that Aberri controls Euskadi, this traditionalism is expected to be shown in the restructuring the society among more organic lines. The role of Catholicism will increase from its already heavily involved role in Basque society, though complete church domination as espoused by most other Integrists is something the Arana brothers always showed aversion to."
 
BAS_Crush_Carlist_Bootlickers:0 "No Quarter Given to Carlists"
BAS_Crush_Carlist_Bootlickers_desc:0 "The Carlists are our fellow traditionalists, but unlike the patriots of Aberri, the Carlists venerate a Spanish monarch. This liability to the Basque cause for sovereignty cannot stand, for while the Carlists at the time seem content to watch how programs within the republic evolve, they still pose the strongest internal enemy to the cause of Basque republicanism. As such, we must ensure that the organization is dealt with, in a manner that will not goad them into full-blown insurrection, but instead make them a part of the political processes of Euskadi or irrelevant in the grand scheme of it."

BAS_Jesuitism_Without_Hispanism:0 "Clergy Free of Hispanic Taint"
BAS_Jesuitism_Without_Hispanism_desc:0 "The clergy of Euskadi remains largely dominated by Basque priests, but given the importance Catholic church played in the previous monarchist regime, it is no surprise that many within the religious shepherds harbour dangerous and seditious ideas. These wolves in sheep’s clothing cannot be allowed to poison the well from which most Basques draw their spiritual strength, and while it would be sinful to harm a man of God over political differences, the traitors will be expelled from our great nation for the sake of Basque spiritual integrity."

There may have been times when Euskal Herria was under foreign rule, and the Spaniards obviously controlled our rightful land for centuries. Yet despite all the hardships, the Basque culture and language lives on, undeterred and prospering, developing to modernity. This is clear proof that the hardy people of Biskaia are God’s chosen, a pure race genetically and spiritually, and we must celebrate this fact, celebrate how despite all the troubles, we have not stooped as low as the Spanish."

While their policies are very much aimed at eradicating Hispanism from Euskal Herria, it’s clear that just exiling all Spaniards would cause our economy and society to fully collapse, and even Aberri’s hardliners can see this. However, Luis Arana Goiri and his supporters have come up with alternate mechanism for dealing with these maketos, as they are now beginning to be called more regularly in the nation."

Sabino Arana himself did not live to see his Irish allies triumph, but his brother Luis saw the Emerald Isle break its shackles once and for all, and it only furthered his resolve to see Euskal Herria free. We must open further dialogue with the Irish state, to further this connection and possibly even create an alliance with them."

BAS_Aranaist_Language_Studies:0 "Euskaran Reforms According to Sabino's Vision"
BAS_Aranaist_Language_Studies_desc:0 "Sabino Arana was, among his numerous other talents, a gifted linguist, and learned the Euskara language on his own. Sabino even attempted to market his own ideas on the trajectory of Euskaran language studies by applying for the head research position of Euskaltzaindia language development and research institute. However, Sabino’s young age and purist ideas did not attract much support, and he was sidelined in favour of another vascologist. However, with the rise of new purist and traditionalist values of Aberri, linguists have seen a resurgence in Arana’s ideas towards the language reform, and now Aberri will undertake a rather Sisyphean task of enforcing these original ideas of Arana on the Euskaltzaindia. This will obviously lead to a great deal of backlash but to end the near-endless bickering between various factions of the institute, it must be done."

Throughout all the events that led to the separation of Euskal Herria from Spain, Luis Arana and his traditionalists have always battled on to fulfill the vision he and his brother shared, and while factors and factions with Euskadi and international community have conspired to keep the the Basques divided, we have always defended the cause of sovereignty. Now, we must remind rest of Euskadi that it is thanks to Aberri that our state rises towards a new dawn as an independent one, not because of the bleeding heart socialists and jeltzales who would’ve happily stayed under the Spanish bootheel."

Much works remains to be done so that the nation may see an even greater dawn, but for now, the actions of Aberri have ensured that foreign influences and internal weak points will not compromise the sanctity of our new state. Had Sabino Arana lived to see the creation his brother Luis has toiled so hard to achieve, he would likely be beyond proud of the new Basque state and its stalwart sentinels of Eusko Alderdi Aberri."

As heirs of the French and Russian Revolutions, we shall bring this unacceptable situation to an end. The clergy’s regressive stranglehold will be destroyed. and in its place, with tireless efforts from our loyal cadres and sans-culottes to educate and guide the people, a new Iberian Cult of Reason shall be established, as our own provocation to the people to free themselves from their own barriers of reactionarism in all its forms, and to venerate the sacred virtues of Liberty, Freedom and Socialism, in our ceaseless march towards the Communist ideal."
 
BAS_Rekindle_Class_Warfare:0 "Escalate Class Warfare in Euskadi"
BAS_Rekindle_Class_Warfare_desc:0 "As we pride ourselves as the proud heirs of Bolshevism and Jacobinism alike here in the troubled lands of the Basque nation, it is only natural that class struggle shall be our order of the day in the path towards Communism. However, there remained many, such as the Abertzales, or ‘patriotic left’ of the EAE and Solidarists of the ELA who still seek to oppose us, defending, sheltering the bourgeoisie and openly opposing the new Socialist Republic. These ‘socialists’ claimed to stand with the toilers, but in practice, they are merely Social-Reactionaries, capitulating to petty nationalist bourgeoisie, placating them in exchange for mere breadcrumbs. We shall mobilize our proletarians, and they will know their task in subjugating whoever seeks to destroy the new revolutionary order, whether it’s the former oppressors, or the traitors in red clothing alike."

BAS_Fortitude_of_the_Party_Line_desc:0 "While the party remained nominally united, there has been much dissension within our ranks since our rise to power. Because of our position as the main communist force in Iberia, and we have taken in many exiled communists ever since the Kingdom of Spain’s folly in foolishly angering the peoples of Spain in doubling down on the caciquismo. As a consequence of this, our party’s ideological foundations are diverse, united around our admiration of the French Communists, and our own dream of bringing communism to our homeland and to all of Iberia. While a diversity in thought is good for maintaining constructive criticism in democratic centralism, we must deter any attempt at factionalism and maintain our party’s focus on bringing a Red Jacobin revolution to Iberia."

BAS_First_Jacobins_of_Iberia_desc:0 "While a socialist spring blooms over these rugged lands, our brothers across all corners of Iberia remain in chains under despotic bourgeois rule. And thus, our path is clear: From Euskadi, we shall pour forth and be the vanguard troops of a new Iberian Revolution, and the light of the Red Jacobin ideal shall shine forth against the reactionaries of yore, and neither the fat clergy, the greedy capitalists and whoever else that seeks to stem the revolutionary tide shall stand in our way."

BAS_Return_to_Tradition_desc:0 "The foolish socialists and republicans thought they could destroy one of the longest standing resistance movements in Iberia, and for that, they have paid the price.

Yet, to protect our people, we cannot rely solely on ground and sea power alone, we must embrace the skies as a battlefield and build up our own air force from the ground up.

One of these colonies, perhaps the most famous one at that, was Newfoundland, populated by Basque fishermen for a time, who were so influential that a local pidgin of Basque appeared among the local Native American population. Perhaps we should reclaim this land for the Basque whalers once more."

In many of the independent South American nations, Basques can constitute even close to thirty or forty percent of the local population, and in the nation of Chile, Basques have long had a large impact on the local elites, many of their important political families coming from Basque background.

BAS.1.t:0 "Spanish No More!"
BAS.1.d:0 "For so long, Euskadi has been nothing but a province of Spain. They have tried to erase our identity, our language, our customs and our culture. But no more will we listen to the commands of Madrid, no more will they dictate how the rich lands of Euskadi are governed. From Bilbao to the Pyrenees, Euskadi is free, and our people are ready to fight and die to retain that freedom, no matter the odds!"
BAS.1.a:0 "Independence!"

BAS.2.t:0 "Eusko Gudarostea"
BAS.2.d:0 "The Eusko Gudarostea, our national army, has been mobilized for the first time. Initially merely a militia force, our commander in chief, Alberto de Montaud Noguerol, has reformed this fledgling force into a proper military. Supplied with guns smuggled in from both Commune of France and Ireland, this hodgepodge arsenal shall serve as deterrent against the blasted Spaniards until we create a more standardized system. For now, the dusty Lebels and Lee-Enfields will be our sword and our faith in the Lord our shield, and with them we shall strike down the Spanish invader should they dare to enter our rightful land. However, we must not remain idle, much work is to be done for our military to be truly modern and on par with that of Spain and our other neighbours."
BAS.2.a:0 "Eusko Gudariak gora!"

BAS.3.t:0 "Defector Caught!"
BAS.3.d:0 "As the Iron Ring of Bilbao was being reinforced, Ertzana motorized police forces have detained the man responsible for much of the designs of the fortifications, Alejandro Goicoechea. He was caught while attempting to escape to the Spanish side of the border, the entire plans of the Iron Ring of Bilbao on the passenger seat beside him. After interrogation, the man broke and revealed that he was a member of the Liga de Acción Monárquica, a Spanish Alfonsist party thought to have been dissolved with the proclamation of the republic. The party was originally founded to help contain Basque nationalism and seek to eradicate it, as the insidious Spaniards have always attempted to, but it seems that the monarchists have now turned to blatant sabotage to drive their arms further. \n\nMany nationalists demand that Goicoechea is executed for treason, and the assets of the monarchists are to be seized, with the supporters of Alfonso XIII detained at least until the end of the war, until a proper trial is held. The socialists, now part of ELA, have demanded that their property is nationalized altogether, to help us fight the foe these monarchists were so eager to support. However, more moderate members of EAE and EAJ have instead argued that we should just seize the assets temporarily and imprison Goicoechea until the war is over and a fair trial can be held."
BAS.3.a:0 "Execute Goicoechea and nationalize the properties, no mercy for the traitor!"
BAS.3.b:0 "Imprison Goicoechea and temporarily seize the properties, they will face justice after the war!"

BAS.4.t:0 "Banning of Spanish Parties"
BAS.4.d:0 "With the war looming just over the horizon, the provisional government has issued a slew of emergency legislation, among them a controversial bill banning all inherently Spanish parties from operating in Basque territory. This has spared some Basque dominated parties, such as Partido Republicano Autónomo Navarro and Unión Navarra from facing the ban, but powerful parties such as the socialist party PSOE, Izquierda Republicana and Accion Popular have been completely removed from the parliamentary politics. The ban has also struck Spanish unions, such as UGT, whose members have flocked to the traditionally Catholic trade union Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna. The Solidarists, as they are often called, have been completely overwhelmed by this new flood of members, and it has severely tipped the union towards socialist politics, although still heavily dominated by Christian values as well. The provisional wartime government has argued that this ban would make it far harder for Spanish imperialists to organize inside Euskadi, but many journalists and opposition politicians have also claimed that this is simply a blatant ultranationalist concession to the Aberri wing of the EAJ, which has recently separated to form their own party."
BAS.4.a:0 "Concession or not, the ban stays. We are Basques now, not Spanish!"

BAS.5.t:0 "Guardia Civil Surrenders!"
BAS.5.d:0 "As the Basque rebellion was proclaimed, Basque nationalists and Carlist militants quickly encircled local Guardia Civil garrisons, and in most of them, forced the local guards to lay down their arms. However, given that the territory was basically the buffer zone between Commune of France and Spanish heartlands, there were more than enough Carabineros and Guardia Civil troops in the area to overpower the Basque militias before they had time to mobilize and arm themselves. Yet when the rebellion came, no concentrated Spanish military effort was taken to decimate it, but instead the central command of the local Guardia Civil, the commanders office in Pamplona, ordered the local forces to stand down. \n\nFew Basques had expected it, but the leader of the Pamplona Guardia Civil, José Rodríguez-Medel, had decided not to support the Madrid regime. When Basque militants came to arrest him, the commander explained that in 1932, when the republic was destroyed, he had been powerless to stop the development. However, now, with Madrid falling to an autocratic and corrupt regime, he could fight back against bastards like Sarjurjo, whose rule he considered illegitimate. As such, he ordered his men to surrender and the armouries of Guardia Civil fell to the hands of the Basque militias, who quickly seized hundreds of rifles, El Tigre and Destroyer carbines and thousands of handguns. Rodríguez-Medel was removed from military command, but he was given a civilian role in the new Basque administration due to his engineer background. Some members of Guardia Civil, especially those with Basque or Republican background, have even joined the militias to carry the fight against the authoritarian regime of Madrid."

BAS.6.t:0 "Resurgence of Herri Kirolak!"
BAS.6.d:0 "With the independence of Basque country secured, the Basque people have entered a new golden age of culture, marked by rapid linguistic development and increased popularity of traditional Basque sports. Herri Kirolak, or rural sports, are a set of various different competitions and traditional tasks that over time have turned into tournaments showcasing mastery of different crafts and athletic merits. Almost all of these sports can track their origins back to the two ancient Basque professions, those of baserritarras, farmers, and arrantzaleas, fishers. Probably the most famous of these sports are Harrijasotzaileak, stone-lifting, and Aizkolaritza, wood chopping.\n\n In Harrijasotzaileak, a stone of immense weight must be lifted by the contestant, and the lift is considered complete once the stone is balanced on his shoulder. Two contestants usually compete on which one can perform more lifts. With Aizkolaritza, the contestant must balance on a log while chopping apart tree trunks as fast as possible, with the one chopping the most in a certain amount of time emerging victorious. Various other sports exist, some even involving animals and humans or just animals, as is the case with Ahari topeka, ram-fighting, where two rams are goaded to fight each other in an arena not too dissimilar to those used in bullfights. For the ram to score points, it must strike the opponents head or horns, with eight hits granting the ram a victory. To aid the animals in these fights, they receive a different diet from a normal ram, usually containing some mixture of beans, apples, red wine, carrots or egg yolk. \n\nSome sports have even attracted international interest after our independence, as the Scottish tourists visiting our lands have been intrigued by our sport, Lasto botatzea, bale tossing, which they claim to be similar to their sheaf toss sport. A cultural mission has been launched to visit Union of Britain and see if our best bale tossers can compete against Scottish champions. The Basque rural sports are often also used as a gambling venue, with bidders choosing their champions and often earning considerable sums in national level races. For the champions, the most common reward is txapela, Basque beret of considerable prestige, and the word champion in Basque, txapeldun, literally means one with beret."
BAS.6.a:0 "Glory to the txapeldun!"

BAS.7.t:0 "Revival of Basque Cuisine!"
BAS.7.d:0 "With our hard-fought independence, the Basque culture is blooming, no longer as shackled to the developments in Spain and gaining increasing influence from France as the Basques there cross the border to visit their western compatriots. Alongside art, music and sports, the Basque cuisine of Euskadi has exploded in popularity, partially because of overwhelming patriotism but also simply because contacts to Madrid and other areas of Iberia are severed. That make it harder to get ingredients for dishes that haven’t traditionally been made here in Euskal Herria, and thus the revival of traditional Basque cuisine is partially practical in nature. The greatest driver of this cultural revival have been txokos, a Basque culinary society that takes place in mainly male-dominated spaces, where Basque men gather to prepare and enjoy local meals, as well as innovate on recipes and ingredients.\n\n Basque cuisine is, as can be expected of such a seafaring people, highly seafood-oriented, but as with all of Iberian and Mediterranean food culture, meat from cattle and pork are very present in the form of chistorra sausages, tripotx lamb sausages and Pamplonan chorizos as well as various steaks grilled slowly over charcoal. Still, for the vast majority of Basques, the salted cod, or bacalao, would be the dish closest to heart given how many different local dishes, from omelettes to bacalao al pil pil the ingredient has made its way into. It is also a cornerstone of the service performed by another great influencer of Basque cuisine, the sagardotegi cider houses. Serving the world famous Basque cider Sagardoa, alongside salted cod omelettes and various other dishes, these establishments have a rather curious habit of serving their cider. During an event called txotx, the cider is served from a large barrel through opening the lid so the cider shoots out and it is then caught by the diners with their glasses, as low as possible so the cider gets as much air into it as possible. Then, meals are continued until the next txotx. For more socializing meals, many Basques swear on the pintxos, which are traditionally eaten as light snacks in taverns and bars.\n\n However, while sagardotegi and pintxo bars are still the most popular places to eat in Euskadi, more traditional restaurants have been gaining ground given the popularity of Nicolasa Pradera’s Andia restaurant. Pradera, a famous Basque chef, published her hit cookbook ‘La cocina de Nicolasa’ in 1933, which circulated throughout Spain and greatly enhanced the popularity of Basque culinary quirks. With our cuisine culture in full ascend, Nicolasa has been asked by the Basque government to tour some other European culinary capitals in order to promote our culture in foreign countries as well, though given the gathering warclouds over Europe, this may be a difficult task to achieve."

BAS.8.t:0 "The Question of Carlist Militants"
BAS.8.d:0 "The Basque republic is only taking its first moves in the world, but already our politicians are preparing for any threat to it, both external and internal. While we are unlikely to be invaded by the French or Spanish as such conflict could spark a much larger war, there are forces within Euskadi that could easily destroy our fledgling democracy. The Carlists, traditionalist monarchist rivals of the the Spanish Alfonsist monarchy, have made it clear many times that they consider liberal democracy an aberration of nature. While they participated in elections during the Republic era and even briefly allied the Basque Nationalist Party, it is clear that coexistence with the Carlists will be strained at best in our new republic. Many within our government urge the use of Ertzana against them, as their powerful Errekete militias could attempt a coup against our government. However, there are others, especially among EAJ and Aberri, who consider them a necessary evil against Spanish or French tyranny, as after all, the Erreketes helped us defeat the Spanish bastards during the struggle for independence. Ultimately, the decision lies with the lehendakari."

BAS.9.d:0 "The Basque government had grown too used to their powerful position in the separatist territory. This has proven to be a catastrophic mistake, as Carlist Erreketes marched to Bilbao today armed to the teeth, completely dismantling what little defences had been established. Commanded by a Carlist militant and politician, Antonio de Lizarza Iribarren, the Errekete militias clashed with socialist and republican militias, but given the completely unexpected nature of this attack, the Basque defences were overwhelmed and their men slaughtered in a series of street skirmishes. The government buildings were swiftly encircled and the entire separatist movement dismantled, although as of now it remains unclear whether Lizarza is acting on behalf of the Basque traditionalist militias or the wider Carlist cause. Whatever the case, the Basque republic has been destroyed as quickly as it began, forced to kneel under the boot of reactionary traditionalism."

BAS.12.d:0 "While we have plenty of rifles and pistols thanks to the raided arsenals of Guardia Civil and Spanish garrisons, it is becoming increasingly clear that we lack many of the things needed by a modern army. Rifles and pistols may be good for skirmishes with police or light border-guarding duties, but what we need is artillery, anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank weapons to hold our own against a conventional military force. Our stock of machine guns is equally woeful, with only a few old MG 08s bought from Germany and some Chauchats smuggled in from France. The government has created an extensive weapons purchase program for the next year, where artillery and ammunition will be purchased from German Krupp plants and machine guns from Bohemian Zbrojovka Brno, as these manufacturers are known to be best among their peers."

BAS.13.t:0 "Fresh Off the Forge"
BAS.13.d:0 "The Weltkrieg showed just how terrifying weapons machine guns, and to a smaller extent, submachine guns could be. The cumbersome Villar Perosa and then ubiquitous Sturmtruppen weapon MP-18 both demonstrated the usefulness of a small, man-portable weapon in pistol calibre, and after the advent of the submachine gun, this design type has only produced newer and more lethal weapons. However, under the rule of Madrid’s kleptocrats, Spain never really invested into those weapons, the closest alternatives being the Astra Model 904 copies of the Mauser M714 Schnellfeuer carbine, which sold in massive orders on the Chinese warlord market. However, even those were more simply conversions of semi-automatic pistols into automatic weapon role, and thus Spanish submachine gun scene was simply at its infancy. Now, however, that is about to change, as the Star Bonifacio Echeverria, a local gun manufacturer, has received an order to put their Si-35 submachine gun model into full scale production. While not particularly novel in design, the submachine is expected to be a rather reliable future mainstay of the Euzko Gudarostea. However, a small controversy has emerged around the design, as it uses the Spanish 9x23 millimetre cartridge. Basque nationalists have argued that using a round designed by the maketos is unacceptable, which has exasperated the designers as these nationalists demand the weapon to be converted into 9 millimetre Parabellum instead."

BAS.14.t:0 "Military Melting Pot"
BAS.14.d:0 "The Euzko Gudarostea, as it stands, is a hodge-podge of different militias, former soldiers of Guardia Civil and Spanish army, and even some Carlist rebels who joined us out of shared disdain for the Madrid regime. The army currently has men from Basque nationalists, socialists, communists, anarchists and republicans and Carlists alike, and tensions are inevitable in such settings. Much work must be done to forge the gudaris, as these new fighters for the preservation of Euskadi have started to be called, into a proper coherent fighting force, and settling disputes of ideological leanings have to be addressed as well.\n\n Thankfully, general Antonio Ortega, who switched sides from Spain to ours during the revolt, has been reorganizing the units in a way that seeks to avoid conflict between the ideological extremes. Similarly, to forge an unified soldier identity beyond party politics, much work has been done to create a culture around the military. The use of Eusko Gudariak, a soldier song written by José María de Gárate, has been touched up by Captain Alejandro Lizaso Eizmendi after our experiences during the war against Spain. Now, the song has developed into a rallying cry that Basques, regardless of ideological divides, can cling onto, and as a tool of patriotic propaganda, it has proven superior to basically any other. Hopefully, we can forge a military that is loyal to Euskadi alone, not to ideological demagogues of any direction."

BAS.15.t:0 "Ikusi Mendizaleak!"
BAS.15.d:0 "When the war came to Euskadi, the mendigoizales were some of the first Basque patriots to answer the clarion call, and armed with simple hunting rifles, pillaged Spanish guns and at times, even just home-made incendiary weapons, these brave men held the line when the Ertzana was being assembled. Consisting of the youngest and most fiercely patriotic Basques, they were born out of a Basque tradition for mountain hiking, and in the past had been utilised to recruit and train Basque nationalists clandestinely up in the Pyrenean mountains. Most of this training had been done by Euzkadi Mendigoxale Batza, a populist separatist movement masquerading as a hiking organization. \n\nThe vice-president of EMB, Mikel de Alberdi, would tragically be the first casualty in our fight against the maketos, falling to the bullets of Carabineros in a skirmish during the first days of the war. While his sacrifice was not in vain, it did severely impact EMB’s inner structure. Given that the organization is struggling internally, we could offer to integrate its fighters into the army properly. While integrating a political organization into our military is obviously questionable, these men are known to not question the decisions of the Basque government, and their skills in mountaineering are simply unmatched by those of our regulars, militias or the armies of our rivals. With this integration, we could have a proper mountaineering units, ready to defend our mighty mountain chain and to provide terrible headaches to our enemies as they try to dislodge these brave gudaris. The EMB organization will remain as a civilian thing as well, but strictly under civilian leadership, with its members hopefully later joining the military mountaineers once they enter their national service.

BAS.16.d:0 "With the declaration of war probably coming in the next few days, as Castile scrambles to return its imperialist rule over Euskadi, we must quickly create a force to oppose this enemy. While the Euzko Gudarostea, a proper Basque army, is being raised to respond to the Spanish threat, we must utilize the freshly created police force, Ertzana, as a temporary military force. Ertzana is primarily a special police force, with many of its men operating out of fast Riley cars and others using motorcycles to quickly move from town to town in the service of justice. However, the largest component of Ertzana is the force on foot, actually the force behind the title of this unit, and it has been described as one of the most modern police forces in Iberia. Recently, the press reported that ‘Ertzana’s foot battalions were formed by young men of a certain culture, more than 1.75 m tall, both trained in the handling of weapons, rifles, machine guns and tear gas. their silver insignia on their berets and their long blue coats, they looked magnificent.’ \n\nThis new addition to the Basque Public Police is seemingly received well by the populace, and even the motorized sections have received praise from the press, with one journalist reporting that ‘they had even better physical presence than those of foot police. With their brilliant brown leather jackets, riding pants, flat caps and leggings, they impressed the people of Bilbao the same way as their revolvers’. Clearly, their presence will be an amazing propaganda victory for us, but before we celebrate this new force too much, the grim reality is that they are still primarily a police force and thus only time will tell if they can face the Spanish army in combat without it ending in a disaster for us.

And this liberty, brought by responsible governance and the mighty arms of Euzko Gudarostea’s loyal soldiers, is the most sacred material value for the Basques now, for never again shall we be ruled by Spanish, French or any other imperialist overlord. The highly disunited and disorganized roots of Basque army are gone, with only a professional military of elite soldiers remaining to stand watch over our tall mountains and serene valleys. Through patriotism, fraternalism and bonds forged through fire, the Basque gudaris, different as they might be ideologically, are all just as committed to the cause of seeing our beautiful state retain its sovereignty. Whatever difficulties the world tosses our way, the Basque army shall weather them in its new form. As such, a new national holiday has been formed to celebrate those that fell during the terrible days of the independence war, and those that still serve the nation, putting their lives at the line to keep our people safe. Gudari Eguna, Warrior Day, will be held on ninth day of November, and among other holidays, a national memory service will be held for the martyrs of the independence war, including a rifle salvo to honour their passing.

The day is a celebration of all things Basque, from the traditional music to local sports and foods, but most importantly, the Basque cider. Sabino believed that without direct and swift action, Basque culture and people would be dissolved into the greater Spanish whole, but the continued tradition of Aberri Eguna proves every year that these fears were unsubstantiated. All around Euskadi, people gather to celebrate, families meet no matter the distances, religious communities pray for the nation, political parties hold rallies to commemorate the father of the republic and the newfound independence. Most interestingly, the celebrations are not merely confined to Euskadi itself, but our Basque brothers over the Pyrenees hold their own parties, defying the French encroachment on Basque culture year after another.

We can, of course, simply keep the Ikurriña, but there are those who prefer the Arrano beltza, Black Eagle, a symbol commonly attributed to the Navarrese king Sancho VII. While not quite as prominent as the beloved Ikurriña, it is favoured by many Basque nationalists, especially those who don’t feel right about using a flag designed by the Arana brothers. Aberri nationalists on the other hand have proposed using the original design made by Luis and Sabino Arana, the father of Basque republicanism, which is a slightly different variant of the Ikurriña.

BAS.20.t:0 "[GetYear] Basque National Elections"
BAS.20.d:0 "For the first time in our history, we are able to hold independent, proper elections made up only of Basque parties. There are 4 parties present at the elections.\nThe left-most party to participate in the elections is the reorganized Eusko Sozialista Alderdi, rebranded section of the local PSOE party, seeking to advance the agenda of Basque workers through parliamentary means. While about as popular as the more moderate EAE, they stand a chance of winning as many Spanish socialists and syndicalists have joined forces with their Basque comrades under one party and vision.\n\nThe second left-wing party is the EAE, led by Tomas Bilbao Hospitallet, who, like the EAJ, believe in a strong Basque state, but disagree with the overt clerical attitude of EAJ. While nowhere near as large as the EAJ, EAE is growing increasingly more popular as the internal conflicts of EAJ cause it to haemorrhage supporters tired of the constant bickering.\n\nThe behemoth of Basque politics is the EAJ party, a strongly Catholic nationalist conservative party. EAJ has dominated the political scene of Euskadi ever since its inception, and their strong links to tradition appeal many within the new state. However, they are staunchly republican, and thus have drawn the ire of many Carlists. Their moderate views into future relations with Spain have also caused them to lose support of the more radical Aberri faction.\n\nA true newcomer to the elections is the party of Elias Gallastegi, the Eusko Mendigoxale Batza. Starting off as a nationalistic mountaineering organization, they have now formed into a proper party with the aim of creating a nationalist, socially concious and anti-capitalist republic. The last but not the least is the radical independence-seeking wing of EAJ, Eusko Alderdi Aberri, led by the brother of legendary Basque nationalist Sabino Arana, Luis Arana. Arana disagrees with the moderate and conciliatory view the EAJ holds of Spain. Arana’s party believes that only armed preparation and vigilant eye on the border will keep Euskadi safe from the imperialists of Madrid, and while they agree with EAJ in economic matters, a compromise between these parties is hardly realistic.\nThe elections have already started in Euskadi, with the general euphoria of independence slightly easing into more temperate state as the population prepares to settle their political differences through the ballot box."

BAS.21.t:0 "Integration of Spanish Unions"
BAS.21.d:0 "Bilbao, the heart of Euskadi, has rapidly expanded its importance in Iberia thanks to the many foundries, mills and factories the city possesses. While Euskal Herria is mainly dominated by rural farmlands, sparsely populated mountain ranges, and rough coastlines dotted with fishing villages, the city of Bilbao stands as a true metropolis, sprawling into all directions. With its increased size and industry, it has become a stronghold of socialism in Basque country, allowing Spanish unions such as the UGT to gain a foothold amongst its workers, especially among the Spanish immigrants. Local unions such as Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna have also remained as a strong force within the city, but their Catholic ideology and strong ties to the Nationalist Party have made them difficult allies for the local Basque branch of the PSOE. However, now that the old PSOE is no more and Euskadiko Alderdi Sozialista stands in its place, the new party must ensure that the Spanish unions are fully brought into the Basque framework, and integrated into the new nation so that the Spanish workers do not become radicalized pawns of the Spanish government in Madrid. As such, the integration of UGT under the new name Langileen Batasun Orokorra has begun, and it will also lead to the absorption of other, smaller Spanish unions such as the important metalworkers union Sindicato del Metal de Vizcaya, as well as the highly prestigious standard-bearers of the Alfa group, Sindicato de Obreros Pistoleros. This process will inevitably create tensions between the Basques and Spaniards, but hopefully the mutual faith in the triumph of socialism and the lack of any real alternatives for the Spaniards will make the transition period pass by smoother."

BAS.22.d:0 "When the Bolsheviks fell in Russia and the Spanish communists remained divided, the Partido Comunista Español cease to be, with only Bloque Obrero y Campesino, Izquierda Comunista Español and Partido Comunista Obrero Español remaining scattered around the Iberian continent. Some contingents of the original PCE remained, and Basque country was one of these, as during the harshest repressions of the Primo de Rivera era, Basque communists would flee to France and seek refuge among the Jacobins of Maurice Thorez and Marcel Cachin. Some of the bravest and most nationalist communists of Euskal Herria would later return during the glory days of the independence war, such as Jesus Larrañaga Churruca, and would serve amongst the battalions formed by EAS, EAE and IFA-LKN, especially in the battle of Albertia mountain. While many of these new members of the resurrected Euskadiko Partidu Komunista are far less opposed to Basque nationalism as their ideological comrades in Spain, they are still heavily influenced by the Jacobins many of their members spent so much time with. As such, EAS leadership is debating whether the party should invite these Communists into the new party, as their influence would likely be marginal. If left unchecked, however, they could pose a strong rival, and knowing their thirst for a revolution, they could gather various other radicals to their banner, something the moderates within EAS wish to avoid at all costs. Even if the communists are added to the ranks of EAS, another question is whether to include only those that have proven themselves patriots of the Basque cause, such as Larrañaga, or to also allow more orthodox communists such as Leandro Carro Hernaez, the nominal leader of EPK, to join as well."

BAS.23.d:0 "Most Basque anarchists belonging to the CNT-FAI’s local branch, IFA-LKN, can hardly even be classified as anarchists in true nature, as they mostly joined the union for better rights and pay, not necessarily out of devotion to the cause. Given that much of the group's support in Euskal Herria comes from fishermen and dockworkers, this is hardly surprising. Yet there are those who do follow the principles of anarchism fiercely in our small nation, and perhaps the greatest example of this is Felix Likiniano, who fought alongside UGT and PSOE militants during the war against Spain, helping to expel Spaniards from Bilbao and Donostia. After the war, he has been an ardent supporter of creating an odd synthesis of anarchism and Basque nationalism, called anarcho-abertzaleism, where the Basque struggle for the preservation of their culture, language and society is mixed with the decentralization into communes and collective ownership of anarchism. While the wider CNT-FAI community has denounced him as a dangerous promoter of statist status quo, EAS could gain a valuable ally in this particular drift within the anarchists, especially as Likiniano’s merits as a fighter against the Spaniards makes him something of a folk hero among the otherwise taciturn coastal anarchists. He has shown willingness to work alongside other left-wing groups in Euskal Herria, and thus it would likely be easy to create an alliance with the anarchists through him, to make sure that the reactionaries of Aberri and EAJ don’t get to dictate the terms of labour organization in Euskadi."

BAS.24.t:0 "Ending the Great Rivalry"
BAS.24.d:0 "The other large union in Euskadi is Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna, a Catholic union propped up by the Nationalist Party, and its grip on the workers of Euskadi remains strong even two decades since its inception. Through social assistance programs and other benefits to its members, as well as appealing to the strong Catholic ethos of Basque workers, the union has made it hard for the UGT’s successor, the LBO union, to attract members. However, given the increased societal tensions between the ownership class and labourers, strikes are becoming more commonplace, and as EAJ’s grip on the Basque population is weakened with the emergence of new parties such as EAE, Aberri and EAB, it is becoming increasingly easy to drive a wedge between the masters behind ELA’s leadership and their support base. Santiago Aznar, LBO’s leader, hopes that with a strong propaganda campaign and extensive advertisement of LBO’s advances in creating a better environment to Basque labourers, the union could finally cause many fence-sitters to take the plunge and leave the Catholic union, finally ending the capitalist oppression ELA has helped facilitate. This is tied to the easing of EAS’ rhetoric in regards to the Catholic Church, as it is hoped that it would make true socialism more appealing to pious workers, helping finally kick the yellow unionists out of the Euskadi’s union scene."
BAS.24.a:0 "Let us hope it works."

BAS.25.t:0 "Esperantist Ideas of Aznar"
BAS.25.d:0 "Santiago Aznar has worked long to legitimize EAS as a democratic, law-abiding party in Euskadi, and his work in merging the Spaniards and Basques into one coherent group has been more than commendable. However, this process has been quite difficult with the massive difference between the Basque and Spanish languages due to the unique nature and rules of the former. However, Aznar’s personal interest may have been able to provide a solution to the problem, at least in the long run, as he is known to be a big supporter of the Esperanto language. Taking inspiration from the Catalan anarchists who have promoted the use of Esperanto among the CNT-FAI organization to overcome language barriers between Spanish and Catalan anarchists, EAS has decided to introduce programs to teach Esperanto to the union and party members among Basque and Spanish socialists. This is hoped to help overcome the animosity felt between Basques and Spanish immigrants caused by the inability to communicate, or the feeling of being forced to speak the language of a nation they had just been at war with. However, Aznar himself has even expressed some interest in binding Esperanto into the party program fully, to promote the language as a bridge between the Iberian peoples, a language of unionism both in terms of workers’ organization and in terms of bringing the many groups of former Spain together."

BAS.26.t:0 "The Complicated Relationship With the Nationalist Party"
BAS.26.d:0 "One would not expect Christian conservatives and moderate traditionalists to get along with socialists, but the situation between Basque socialists and conservatives of the Nationalist Party is relatively complicated. While the two parties bicker and compete on the unionist front due to both supporting the two biggest unions of Euskadi, the party leaders of EAS and EAJ, Santiago Aznar and Jose Antonio Aguirre, respectively, are on relatively good terms due to collaboration fostered during the revolt against Spain, with Aznar serving as the industry advisor. Aznar collaborated with other EAJ members, such as Jesús Maria de Leizaola as well, chairing the Defence Committee of Bilbao during the war. So while the two parties will most likely remain rivals and competitors for the foreseeable future, there is much to be gained from collaboration for both parties, and alliances both in the parliament and in the local municipal levels are not out of the question. Some Christian members of the EAS have even proposed forming a coalition with the Nationalists, arguing that for the time being, focusing on the general improvement of the nation is more important than dealing with capitalists and property owners, as the threat of Spanish return looms on the minds of many. Additionally, they argue that the Nationalist Party’s leadership has a long history of providing help for the workers and unemployed. However, the more Marxist members of our organization, especially those in the communist wing, argue that these are just paternalist scraps being tossed to the workers so that they behave."

BAS.27.d:0 "The Basque region has a long history with co-operatives owned entirely by workers, and the king of this style of production ownership is the Alfa co-operative company, located in the town of Eibar. The co-operation was a stronghold of UGT activity before the war, and with Basque independence, it has become a cornerstone of the EAS’s program. Starting off as a weapons manufacturing plant in the 1920s, they followed earlier projects of Gizupkoan socialists, such as the Cooperative la Eibarresa, who had already begun making shotguns in the late 19th century. However, Alfa did not merely continue the gunmaking tradition, even though their copies of the Smith and Wesson revolvers as well as Browning semi-automatic pistols were relatively popular among Spaniards. Instead, Alfa transitioned to more generalized metallurgy, and most importantly, the manufacturing of sewing machines. In the past decade, they have pioneered many pro-worker policies, such as the implementation of the 8-hour workday, and though the company dropped the production of weapons in the early 1930s, they have returned to the trade once more following conversions done during the independence war, though as licenses of American weapons are hard to come by now, the company has moved to products of Astra and Star instead. Alongside the guns, their sewing machines have become popular among Basque ladies, and the various women organizations of Basque parties have ordered these prestigious machines in bulk for courses and women’s education. For the EAS, the success of Alfa is proof that the workers do not need capitalist middlemen to guide production, and the government of Lendakari Aznar has decided to fund further expansion of not only the Alfa group, but also similar ventures both in industry but also in agriculture and fishing businesses."

Through cunning coalition alliances, promotion of worker ownership, and the expansion of the role of the workers in Basque society, the role of capital and reactionary institutions such as the Catholic church have dwindled in importance. Hopefully in the future, the concentrated efforts of EAS-LBO will smash apart the chains of reactionaries and upper bourgeoisie plutocrats, and while the EAS is still abiding by the democratic system out of respect for other nationalist parties and the collective Basque society, the party is looking for every chance it gets to steer Basque country to a truly equal and progressive society. But for now, the party and its Lendakari, Santiago Aznar, can celebrate the successes of the last few years and the accomplishments produced during them."

While EAE’s leadership, including the more left-leaning figures like Tomas Bilbao, were willing to work with the Republican government during the two years of its existence, the dream of a free Euskadi, with the Ikurriña proudly unfurled over all its lands, was always the main goal of the movement. However, there were some within the movement who saw the alliances EAE made with socialists to be disrespectful to the ideals of Basque republicanism and faith, and they went on to form the EAE Autonomist wing, almost rejoining the EAJ conservatives.\n\n They also supported the continued desire for autonomy over independence, which didn’t tie well with the main party line. While these dissidents were not a large group, roughly around thousand in strength, the EAE really cannot afford the existence of a rival organization, no matter how small. With the advent of Euskadi’s independence, the party could seek to absolve these splinters, bringing them back into the fold, as many of them are still more liberal than the members of EAJ. With the EAE’s election victory as well, it seems their best bet to influence matters in the nation, even if they might have to contend with the socialists in a coalition."

BAS.31.d:0 "As the Spanish collapse began, large numbers of Spaniards began fleeing their decimated state to the splinter regions such as Euskadi, and yet more arrived from exile to extend a hand of friendship to fellow republicans, as they shared no love for the monarchy. However, the racial supremacist views of Sabino Arana are deeply rooted in the society of the Basques today, and the war with Spain has hardly made the situation any better. Many Spaniards, eager to serve the Basque administration, have joined various sports organizations or cultural clubs, or even have fought in the Eusko Gudarostea. However, they find themselves shunned from these places because of their language, place of origin or even simply because of their surnames. This is especially dire in the Navarrese regions and Bilbao, which have a far greater number of Spanish locals, refugees, and immigrants. The repression of Spaniards is visible there every day, sometimes leading to difficult situations as Aberrianos and Mendigoixales clash with Spanish immigrants on the streets. The term ‘maketo’ is becoming increasingly common among Basques as tensions rise, and unless something is done to alleviate the situation, there will be an outburst of violence that may tear this young state apart.\n\n Thankfully for Eusko Abertzale Ekintza, the party has always promoted pluralist policies, and unlike the EAJ, has never enforced a policy of only allowing people with Basque surnames to join the party. As this fact is becoming more commonly known around the nation, more and more Spaniards are flocking to EAE’s party banner, seeking help for their problems that have gone unanswered by the conservatives. While this is likely to dilute the ideological background of EAE to some extent, it has boosted the party’s numbers immensely, and is probably the reason the splinter party was able to triumph in the elections. Members of the old Spanish parties, such as Izquierda Republicana, Union Republicana and Derecha Liberal Republicana have formed a new strong force within the party, and their aid is valuable as Euskadi asserts itself as a new nation in the world, with institutions to match the current era."

BAS.32.d:0 "The party platform of EAE has never been the most clear and concise, and the party remains relatively divided between various liberal middle-class nationalists, moderate union leaders and secular Catholic progressives. Especially with the influx of Spaniards, the party is almost indistinguishable from its old form. Nevertheless, the left-wing ideologies are still the beating heart of the party, and its commitment towards a modern, secular and tolerant Euskadi has not disappeared anywhere, merely grown stronger over the years.\n\n As such, the reactionaries of the Reichspakt, Adriabund and the vengeful imperialists of the Entente are hardly ideal allies in the eyes of the Abertzales, though if the situation demands for it, these ideals can be swept aside. Nonetheless, many Abertzales, especially ones like Tomas Bilbao, Anacleto Ortueta and Luis Ruiz Aguirre, sympathize with the Internationale’s cause the most, even with their disdain for the Totalist movements. After all, during the independence war, only Internationale supported the cause of the Basques, even if mainly to weaken their Spanish neighbour. While this sympathy may not lead to full-on joining of the party, as the conservatives and Aberri could very well see this as an abandonment of Basque democracy, there is no reason why Euskadi should not align its trade more with the Internationale.\n\n After all, while the nations of the alliance may not be capitalist, they still have plenty of things for trading, and due to being surrounded by enemies, not many people to trade with. Thus, while Euskadi might not be the powerhouse of the global economy, the nation may provide France and Britain with products they may not otherwise be able to get. Some, such as Luis Arana and the Carlists, may still denounce this collaboration as ‘dangerous meddling with the devil’, but unless they win the next elections, there is little they can do to directly oppose these measures outside of an actual revolt, a revolt that would likely not get much sympathy."

BAS.33.d:0 "When the Republic died, the idea of a Popular Front, first theorized during the Pact of San Sebastian, died with it. Or so it was thought, but as the young republics of Iberia assert their independence, the need to counter the more fervently reactionary forces within their societies once again rises to the surface. Euskal Herria, with its strong Carlist presence, is no different, as the young republic may have taciturnly allowed Carlists to fight alongside it during the independence war, but the future of such ceasefire is uncertain. The Carlists of Navarre and Basque countryside harbour dark plans, and the ultranationalists of Aberri are hardly better, clinging to Integrist ideas of total Catholic domination of Euskadi and expulsion of Spaniards from the realm one way or another.\n\n This cannot be allowed to happen. If a pluralist and democratic Euskadi is to survive, it must be defended by those loyal to it. The Popular Front theorized by Spaniards, Galicians, Catalans and Basques alike seems to be the strongest way to defeat the forces of traditionalism, and who better to lead it than the moderate left-nationalists of Eusko Abertzale Ekintza? The party has many members known for their skills at cooperating between the different forces of Basque society. Tomas Bilbao Hospitalet can use his union connections to strike a deal with the socialists of EAS and its union, LBO, while Gonzalo Nárdiz’s stellar political maneuvering with the Jeltzales of EAJ during the war earned him quite a bit of respect among the conservatives.\n\n Finally, Spanish allies of EAE can reach out to the Navarran republicans, especially members of the Partido Republicano Autonomo Navarro, to get them into our coalition as well. Should the EAS support us, we are bound to get assistance from the Basque nationalists among the anarchists and communists as well. While this wide coalition is bound to be a cumbersome affair, requiring careful balancing of various interests, the EAE must become the strong force of compromise that keeps the torch of republicanism burning so bright that the darkness of traditionalism may never extinguish it."

BAS.34.d:0 "Now that the rule of the Abertzales has solidified over Euskadi, the party has enough support to secularize the new state. This is by far the most controversial part of the entire party manifesto, and one that is inevitably going to lead into issues with the Aberrianos, and probably also the Mendigoizales and Jeltzales.\n\n Still, it is a policy that the EAE has been committed to from the start, and while controversial, it is a stepping stone on the road to progress. Many Abertzales are devout Catholics, but even they realize that tying the governing apparatus to a religious organization, no matter how inherently linked they are here in Euskal Herria, is bad for social cohesion in the long run. Still, the EAE’s leadership has learned from the mistakes of Spanish republicans, and while the secularization process in Spain was a petty and vindictive affair aimed at crushing church power, the government of Euskadi aims for it to be a slow and methodical process, done with respect to the Catholic church, local monasteries and other Catholic organizations.\n\n No church property will be seized without recompensation, though the ikastolaks will be integrated into the regular school system. Clergy personnel in schools can return to their actual religious duties, though those wishing to continue teaching can do so after acquiring the necessary credentials. The secularisation of schools will be the main step towards a secular Euskadi, though other administrative reforms are also required, especially to replace religious administrators and bureaucrats with civil ones. The state will also be able to legitimize civil unions and allow divorces initiated by either side of the marriage. The socially conservative and deeply Catholic nation’s populace will likely abhor these measures, but without decoupling religion from state affairs, Euskadi is bound to never modernize fully."

However, as the EAE focuses on building the Basque welfare state from the ground up, expanding the social security, unemployment benefits, children’s healthcare and pensioner aid, Lehendakari Tomas Bilbao has raised the question of housing as well. Being an architect, he realizes the importance of functional living quarters to the well-being of the citizenry. Bilbao has recommended that the government utilizes his contacts with both domestic and foreign architects and engineers to fund a large-scale transformation of the nation’s public infrastructure to a new level.\n\n While this will obviously be costly and time consuming to finish, the government believes that the benefits gained in creating new jobs and earning valuable construction knowledge will off-set the short term losses in capital. Bilbao, a strong proponent of Expressionism, has suggested contacting German architects to help with the project, creating connections to the Kaiserreich as well, which may help alleviate some of the criticism that the EAE government has gotten over trade deals with the Internationale. It is hoped that the rebuilt Bilbao and Donostia are better able to house the growing population of Euskadi’s urban areas."

BAS.36.t:0 "Eusko Emakume Ekintza"
BAS.36.d:0 "The leadership of Eusko Aberzale Akintza has decided to further expand the women’s section of the party, Eusko Emakume Ekintza. The importance of these organizations to the Basque society cannot be understated, and the success of EAE’s rival party Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea in utilizing its own women’s section Emakume Abertzale Batza to garner support among the proletariat of Euskadi. The EEE will aim to draw Basque women away from their very stagnant ways, chained to kitchens and the few almost feudal-era jobs that they are allowed to perform.\n\n The EEE’s main role will henceforth be the expansion of understanding into women’s rights in Euskadi, and it will utilize various different branches of the organization to achieve this. EEE’s main newspaper, formerly Mujeres, now translated to Emakume, is already in full printing order. Florentina Tasende, the president of the organization, has also worked diligently to establish ties to other progressive and left-leaning women’s clubs in Euskadi, such as Hogar de la Mujer Moderna and the former women’s organization of PSOE in the region, Círculo Femenino.\n\n It is hoped that the expansion of EEE would finally drag the traditionalist and highly hierarchical society of Euskadi to modernity, especially considering that many of the more conservative women still view the lack of opportunities to progress in their careers as negative yet the main party of EAJ is not particularly interested in driving a change to this. EEE is expected to become relatively popular among the existing women workers of Euskadi, especially the cardmakers of Fournier and the cartridge makers of Eibar, though.\n\n Recently, the women’s movement of Tasende has sought to improve relations to other similar movements in the other Iberian nations, such as the L'Unió de Dones in Catalonia and the Unión de Mulleres in Galicia led by Urania Mella. While there’s been some degree of worry within the EAE leadership, especially among more liberal rather than socialist leaders, such as Luis Urrengoetxea, that especially the latter organization could fill the heads of Basque women with ideas of syndicalism and anarchism, this seems unlikely, as the women’s sections of local syndicalists and anarchists would likely have taken such individuals in already. This international cooperation is more likely to further strengthen the hold of feminism in Euskal Herria, and it is hoped that this in turn would lead to further strengthening of EAE and EEE."

All but one, Eusko Abertzale Ekintza. The party has rejected the confederalist vision of pushed especially by Jeltzales, Mendigoxales and Aberriak, claiming that the nation is small enough and modern communications technology strong enough to not warrant massive amounts of local autonomy.\n\n They also view the Carlists with strong suspicion, and especially Anacleto Ortueta, one of the more socialist-leaning members of EAE, believes that if the Carlist regions are given too much autonomy, they could easily attempt to organize a rebellion that would seek to either topple the Basque republic or separate Navarra from it. If the time came when EAE would seek reuniting with Spain, the federalism question could be revisited, but for the time being the party is very heavily invested in pushing through legislation and changes to the constitution of Euskadi that would see the confederation dissolved in favour of an unitary republic. This has obviously stirred up a massive degree of controversy, and especially in Navarra this is seen as a grave insult, but the EAE government believes that as the unitary state model takes yield, the naysayers will likely be proven wrong by the more efficient administration of the state."

The party at the time stood largely on the side of liberal reformism, especially when it came to members such as Luis Urrengoetxea, but there were others, such as the party leader Tomas Bilbao and his staunch ally Anacleto Ortueta, who especially after Sanjurjada veered into left-wing politics and started collaborating with the Third Internationale. While never openly Marxist or syndicalist, the socialist tendencies began to gain traction within the party after 1932 and the current structure of the movement is rather heterodox.\n\n Given this situation, the party is understandably quite torn on what economic, social and administrative reforms to pursue, as the uncertain leadership has to debate with their opponents on the direction of the party almost constantly. It’s clear that a party convention is necessary to hammer home the details of the party platform, and the party has organized one in the town of San Andres, the very home of EAE where the Manifesto kickstarting the party as an independent entity of the EAJ was written in 1930. There are currently three central factions within the party, the socialists, radicals and technocrats, with Tomas Bilbao leading the socialists, Urrengoetxea being a central figure of the liberals alongside Pello Irujo and Sabin Seijo, and Justo Gárate being the leader of the technocrat wing, taking many of their ideas from the Republican-era organization Agrupación al Servicio de la República.\n\n  They wish to transform Euskadi into a unitary, somewhat utopian and highly specialist-led state, without the dismissal of democracy but more a heavily organized state, with semi-state run economy and strong separation between church and state. The socialists of Bilbao seek further co-operation with the socialists of Eusko Sozialista Alderdi, with the creation of EAE’s own nationalist and socialist union as well. The liberals of Urrengoetxea seek further cooperation with Navarrese liberals and republicans, such as Partido Republicano Autonomo Navarro and Unión Navarra. They take most of their inspiration from French and Spanish radicals, but their views are obviously less hostile towards minority groups than those of the most prominent Spanish radical, Alejandro Lerroux. The liberal wing is still committed to progressive evolution of Basque society, but without necessarily dismissing capitalism, and they propose the creation of welfare state which would limit the extent of inequality in Euskal Herria. The party could also seek to merge this ideas and continue on the course of liberalized socialism, but it can be damaging in the long term.."

Under the blessings of God and the examples of both Sabino Arana and Ramon de la Sota, the party has made sure that the new republic at the very edge of Iberia is an example for rest of the world to follow, walking the tightrope of compromising with the nationalist socialists of EAS and the traditionalists of Aberri, providing an alternative to the radicals and creating an organization for those workers who do not fall to the temptations of syndicalism.\n\n The protection of Basque nation is taken care of by such capable men such as Candido Saseta, the watchdog of EAJ who led the Basques to freedom, while Jesús María Leizaola and Manuel Irujo will ensure that no Basque ever goes hungry or idle in the new republic. All this happens under the leadership of Euskadi’s first lehendakari Jose Antonio Aguirre, who proved his worth during the rebellion and has gone on to become a bastion of Basque republicanism ever since. It would seem that the EAJ may never again lose its grip on power, for the party’s popularity has soared to newfound heights, but this does not mean that it can remain careless.

However, in recent years, syndicalist ideas have started to infiltrate the movement despite the best efforts of its president, Manu Robles-Aranguiz.\n\n Lehendakari Jose Antonio Aguirre has made it clear that EAJ cannot survive without the support of the Solidarists, and thus massive efforts must be made to upheld the ideological cohesion of the union. Syndicalist rabble will be expelled from the movement, for their agitation is simply too dangerous to be allowed with Euskadi’s neighbours being what they are.  However, more efforts must be placed in general to make ELA competitive in the new union environment of Euskadi if Jeltzales are going to uphold their hegemony even among the workers.\n\n Increased social benefits from joining the union will be guaranteed, and some of the union’s more reform-minded members have pointed out that the government should encourage the creation of more co-operatives, food banks and collective loan funds as the nation regenerates from the economic woes brought upon first by Black Monday and secondly by the war of independence. José Maria Arizmendiarrieta, a seminarian and keen supporter of Catholic co-operatives, has been a very strong driver of this line of reform, and he proposes setting up an experiment along this line in one of the Basque industrial towns, such as Mondragon, to gain further experience with Catholic worker’s self-management."

The underground cell of Spanish monarchists in Bilbao had come to an end. Around Euskal Herria, dozens of similar groups had been arrested thanks to a mole in the organization. While the group was funded by various capitalist conservatives and monarchists of Spanish origin, such as Victor Chavarri y Anduiza and Juan Tomás Gandarias, much of their organization is made up of radicalized Spanish immigrants afraid of Basque racial policies or angered by the banning Spanish parties.

However, there is a strong stain of shame attributed to his ideas that the party must finally cast into the abyss of oblivion, as it has no room for it in the modern state of Euskadi. One of the reasons Arana supported the creation of a Basque state was the fact that he considered an union with Spain to lead Basques into eventual assimilation and disappearance of Basque culture.\n\n While the current leadership of the EAJ does concede that this may have happened with Spain, it does not excuse the later remarks of Arana, who claimed that Basques were, inherently through their biological and mental characteristics, more pure than their Spanish counterparts. Even with the fervent boost of nationalism that the citizens of Euskadi have now received from their victory against Madrid, the party simply cannot push such virulent ideals against the Spaniards that chose to remain here.\n\n Euskadi cannot become a caste society where the racial hierarchy is determined by theories of a man who never lived to see the reality of his national project, and thus Lehendakari Aguirre and rest of the EAJ cabinet have decided to lift the restrictions towards membership of Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea. Previously, party membership was gated behind having a Basque surname, but now, even those with Spanish names can join. It is hoped that this will ensure a more fair and balanced society.

BAS.47.d:0 "One of the obstacles the Basque people had to deal with under Spanish rule throughout the years was that neither the ossified monarchy nor the short-lived republics had paid much attention to the education of the Basque people, with Basque matters continuously neglected by institutions organized by the Spanish governments or the Catholic Church. Schools set up by short-lived Republican governments would attempt to enforce full secularisation on the Basque schools, disregarding the wishes and pious nature of the Basque people, while the monarchy wanted to keep the Basque people down by heavily limiting Basque cultural expressions in favor of Spanish practices. However, even as oppression continued, the proud sons of Euskal Herria still managed to find ways to further the cultural development of their people, and in 1914, the first experiment in Basque-centric schooling began.\n\n In 1917, Migel Muñoa, a local teacher in Donostia created the first ikastola, marking the emergence of the first proper Basque school. Ikastolak were meant to teach Basque children in their native language, focusing on matters of Euskal Herria first and foremost, with a large emphasis on Basque traditional songs and culture alongside Catholic religious education. Meanwhile, Ramon de la Sota Aburtos, the son of an industrialist and famous Basque politician belonging to the EAJ was also heavily involved in creating a network of ikastolaks around Euskal Herria. The son of an industrialist, he envisioned a federation of 125 schools across the Basque region under the same model. Sadly, the Sanjurjo coup of 1932 led to increased repression of Basque nationalism, and the ikastolak system was partially torn down or nationalized by the military and Acción Popular alliance. This period of suppression would only culminate in further teacher mobilization, where teachers of the existing ikastolak would secretly maintain the ikastolak network through teaching Basque children behind closed doors in their own homes.\n\n Of particular note, Elbira Justa, a member of EAJ’s women section, Emakume Abertzale Batza, was one of the strongest advocates for this approach. With Euskadi’s independence finally a reality under the government of the Jeltzales, Justa has proposed a revival movement of the ikastolak system, resurrecting and modernizing de la Sota’s old educational institution and network, with unanimous agreement from the government. To that end, the Eusko Ikastola Batza was created to supervise the renewed ikastolak system. Justa, known for her traditionalist stance in politics, has nonetheless drafted a progressive educational program, with groups of children being given fair and equal education regardless of gender, while new pedagogical methods are adapted from the most modern and up-to-date schools of thought, such as Adolf Ferriere’s ideas in La Forge or Maria Montessori’s ideas on children’s prominence.

BAS.48.t:0 "Dilemma of Two Founders"
BAS.48.d:0 "Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea is one of the oldest parties in Iberia that still exists to this day, but the party has had its fair share of clashing identities. Perhaps the best example of this was the differing viewpoints of the two most important jeltzales, Sabino Arana and Ramon de la Sota. Both influenced the party from its infancy in the late 1800s all the way to the difficult years of the early 1900s. Sabino Arana can be classified as the father of Basque nationalism, and his view into nationalism was influenced by his own experiences with Carlism and later, Integrism.\n\n His view of Basque nationalism was inherently tied to Catholicism and race, and he considered Basques to be simply more pure in every way, but most importantly, in their faith, which he attributed essentially to the involvement of priests in such a grassroots level in Basque society. He did not believe that Spaniards and Basques could coexist within the boundaries of one nation. Ramon de la Sota on the other hand remained a polar opposite of Arana, promoting progressive, modern and autonomous Euskadi that would not seek to break away from the wider nation, but instead reform Euskal Herria’s status within it. With de la Sota influenced by moderate liberals and conservatives and Arana by hardliner traditionalists, the two men similarly came from very different backgrounds, and their viewpoints would regularly clash despite the co-operation in creating the party.\n\n Had Arana lived longer, he would’ve likely created a splinter of the party similar to what Elias Gallastegi and his brother Luis Arana Goiri would later do with Aberri. The de la Sota’s wing would go on to form the Comunión Nacionalista Vasca in 1921 after the entire EAJ party broke apart over the question of independence or autonomy. While these wings united temporarily, the Aberrianos would leave once again after the death of the Republic. Today, EAJ has to balance the two founders of the party and their ideas, for despite the ejection of Aberri, there are still those who seek to emulate Arana’s ideas to the letter within EAJ. For many within the party, the best option would simply be to leave the ideas of the past to where they currently lay, and not burden the current ideals of the party with those of either Arana or de la Sota."

Created first in the early 1920s, it was inspired by the visit of Irish revolutionary Victor Ambrose Martin, who recommended the creation of a women’s section akin to the Irish Cumann na mBan. EAB would go on to be a cornerstone of the EAJ, providing great service as a supporter of ELA’s social benefits, hosting meals for the workers, running soup kitchens during economic hardship and promoting culture among the Basque workers.\n\n Additionally, the service provided by EMB’s women members during the set-up of the ikastolak system and Basque kindergartens cannot be understated, as teachers such as Elbira Justa practically revolutionized the field of Basque patriotic education. While the EAB has similarly splintered as the main Jeltzale party, breaking into the women’s section of the Mendigoixales and the Abertzales, the organization attached to the EAJ remains the largest by far, as many Basque women identify the strongest with conservative currents.\n\n However, as opposed to the total exclusion of women from political duties as Aberri does, the EAJ’s leadership has encouraged the Jeltzale women to actively participate in the distribution and production of party propaganda, as well as the creation of new clubs for practicing cultural and technical skills. A recent example of this was the purchase of large quantities of sewing machines from Alfa factories to be used for training women for the textile work force.

BAS.52.d:0 "As Aberri has addressed many issues with the Basque nation for quite some time now, the Basques have begun to live according to the traditional values once more. However, there are still matters which the party wants addressed, and the main one right now is the question of women’s organizations. Both Sabino and Luis Arana have always been of the opinion that the role of women in Basque society is as mothers and homemakers, not as independent political actors. Luis Arana has often argued that the patriotic duty of women in Euskal Herria is to secure the homes and oversee the moral purity of the family, subservient to the head of the family. As such, women’s sections such as Emakume Aberri Batza, Emakume Abertzale Batza and Eusko Emakume Ekintza belonging to the organizations of mendigoxales, jeltzales and abertzales respectively, are to be banned. Luis Arana believes that these organizations will lead to the fracturing of the traditional gender roles, and in the case of EEE, into a situation where Basque women are tainted with such Spanish ideas such as liberalism, anarchism, socialism and progressivism. This decision has riled up many a politician and layman in Basque country, with many claiming that Aberri is simply attempting to level the playing field as their party does not possess a women’s section, given the paternalistic attitude of Luis Arana and his supporters. Prominent members of these organizations, including Karmele Erratzi and Florentina Tasende, have come out to publicly denounce the aberriak ideology, claiming it to be stuck in the Middle Ages. They urged woman voters of Aberri to cease their support for the party. Even the Carlists have chimed in to the debate, a part of their organization breaking with Aberri over the banning of their women’s section. Nonetheless, Aberri government remains adamant that this decision is final, though criticism continues to mount."

BAS.53.t:0 "The Only True Vision of Aranas"
BAS.53.d:0 "There are few men in the history of Euskal Herria as important as Sabino Arana and his brother Luis, for without them, the entire concept of Aberria, or Euskadi, would not have come to fruition, at least not within the timeframe it did. Sabino Arana’s contributions to the awakening of the Basque mind to the concept of them being more than just a minority region within the Hispanic imperial carcass cannot be overestimated. However, his brother Luis Arana Goiri is perhaps even more important to this progress, as his chance encounter with a Cantabrian person on a train decades ago set the two brothers on a course of no return. The Cantabrian had claimed that the Basques could not claim that they weren’t good Spaniards given that they had fewer responsibilities than rest of Spain because of their charters, as the Basques did not serve in the Spanish army nor did they contribute to the treasury of Spain.\n\n This revelation made young Luis question the very nature of his beliefs and identity, and he came to understand that he was, in fact, Biskaian, not Spanish. He would convert his brother Sabino to the cause of Basque nationalism, both leaving their Carlist roots behind. The two brothers would go on to form the Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea, and both Sabino and Luis would serve as the party leader for periods of time until Sabino was taken from this world by Addison disease. Luis dedicated his life to upholding the vision he and Sabino had created, and fought the Euskalduna wing of the party led by Ramon de la Sota, who oversaw its conversion into an autonomist, moderate Christian democratic party. Over three decades, Luis has fluctuated in the party hierarchy, but the 1932 Sanjurjada coup and Basque reactions to it were the final straw that made him break with the party.\n\n The Basques, divided over whether to seize the moment and rebel, or to see things play out, squandered their opportunity and paid heavily for it, as the Guardia Civil would stomp Basque nationalists and autonomists alike under heel. However, while Basques finally learned their lesson, Luis Arana had vowed not to return to the EAJ, forming his own party out of the Aberri traditionalists. Unfortunately the Mendigoxales, his old allies, have drifted away from traditionalism and formed their own party, but as the recent election victory has proven, the Aberrianos are not shaken. The new party has solemnly sworn to cleanse the nation from socialist atheism and Spanish taint alike, finding a new, pure Euskadi under the solidified yet unchanged vision of Luis and Sabino Arana."

BAS.54.t:0 "Triumph of Traditionalism"
BAS.54.d:0 "The two Arana brothers came from a family of Carlists jauntxos, petty nobles, and received an education in a Jesuit-run school of their local area. However, after Sabino and Luis Arana drifted towards Basque nationalism following the Spanish suppression of Basques’ traditional rights and the overall national awakening of Europe in the latter half of 1800s, the two brothers abandoned Carlism altogether. This decision was mainly because of Carlism’s Spanish nature, but it was also influenced by Sabino’s belief that men cannot be truly equal under a monarchy, only under a republican system. Despite this shift towards republicanism, the two brothers never truly abandoned traditionalism as a whole, and adopted Integrist ideas instead, advocating for the supremacy of Catholic faith, organic society and traditional laws of the Basque region. While Integrism is a Spanish ideology, evolving from Carlism into its own, somewhat unpopular branch, it had Basque theorists as well, namely Arturo Campión.\n\n Campión has been a strong proponent of Basque nationalism alongside his integrist ideas, and he has been a staunch defender of both the fueros, the charter of Basque autonomy, as well as the traditional Catholic faith of the Basque people. He is also notable in fostering good relations between Navarrans and Basques, always fighting for both these regions in the face of Madrid’s centralizing tendencies. The Arana brothers and Campión have shared many ideals, and given that all of them have been champions of Basque nationalism and language development, it is perhaps not too far-fetched to say that Integrism, despite its Spanish origins, is a backbone of Basque nationalism in its original form. This is also exemplified in the peculiar nature of Integrism, as the movement has never had a strict monarch to support like the Carlists and Legitimists did. With the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic, some Integrists even adopted an accidentalist stance, willing to support the idea of a republic if it meant furthering their aims.\n\n However, Arana brothers abandoned Carlist monarchism ages ago, and their Integrism has always been coloured by republicanism. With the advent of Aberri dominance in Basque politics, the party has began to promote the ideology as the true, undiluted idea of Basque Republicanism, free of the tainted ideas of liberalism and syndicalism that have caused so much godlessness and moral corruption in the world with their ideas of atheism and individualism. Only through the purification of the Basque nation through Catholic faith and traditional norms can the new Euskadi prosper, just as Sabino and Luis always intended."

BAS.55.t:0 "Prying Apart the Carlist Cause"
BAS.55.d:0 "In the weeks following Aberri’s election victory, the party has worked diligently to secure its power in the landscape of Basque politics. Traditionalist-leaning members of EAJ have been rescued from the main part and Catholic workers from Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna and Eusko Neziri Alkartasuna unions have been reeled into join Aberri instead. Negotiations have also begun with the Navarrese conservative party Union Navarra, that traditionally supported Spanish monarchism and the ideas of Accion Popular but has now been left bereft of support. If the remaining Navarrese of Union Navarra want to continue fighting the good Catholic fight, they can do so under the auspices of Aberri. However, the Eusko Alderdi Aberriak party has already set its sights on the bastion of traditionalism in Euskadi.\n\n The Traditionalist Communion of the Carlists are a mighty threat to the Basque republic, but to Aberri, they may be an ally as well. Despite the differences in preferred form of state management, the Carlist program is very close to the ideas of Aberri. The association that the Carlists share to the maketo crown is however disgraceful, and it has proven to be a difficult subject to overcome for Aberri in the past. The independence of Euskadi has however driven a wedge between the Carlists who still support a reclamation of Madrid and the Carlists more heavily tied to their ancestral homeland, and Basque nationalism, previously a mere outlier within the movement, is now taking it by storm. The rural farmers, fishermen and other commoners of the Traditionalist Communion have had something of a national awakening, and despite attempts to curb it by the leadership of the movement, it continues to fester within the roots of the Communion. Now, Aberri’s leadership has been discussing the matter thoroughly, and a conclusion has been reached, giving two possible outcomes.\n\n One would be to strike now and utilize the wedge within the movement to integrate those traditionalists into Aberri who have lost faith in the Bourbon crown. Another would be to open talks about a possible alliance with the Carlists, giving them an ultimatum that they cannot refuse. Whichever way the situation unfolds, it is likely to cause the Carlists to become a more tame force within Euskal Herria, though some alarmists claim that the ultimatum could shake the Carlists out of their stupor and into action against our Republic."

BAS.56.t:0 "The Question of Maketos"
BAS.56.d:0 "The independence of Euskal Herria has been a great victory for the cause of Basque nationalism and preservation of our ancient culture and language, but it has not been without significant societal issues either. The long-term influence of Spanish dominance to the region has been devastating, and while the Basques have stubbornly held on to their own ways and tongue, the chauvinistic and colonial regime enforced upon the small people by Madrid and its lapdogs has almost made the culture extinct. Now, a renaissance of Basque culture is in full swing, but the question has been raised. What of the remaining Spaniards, how must the new government deal with them? This has been an especially difficult question to Aberri, who have followed the Basque supremacist and anti-Spaniard ideas of Sabino Arana thus far.\n\n However, the reality of the matter is that following the Spanish encroachment upon traditionally Basque regions after the industrial revolution in Bilbao, there is now a massive group of Spaniards in the city and also in areas like Navarre who do not share a shred of ancestry with Basques. These interlopers have come here to use Basque resources and factories for their own gain, and if they had had their way, the Basque way of life and culture would have been erased. However, getting rid of the maketos, as the Aberri calls the Spaniards, is proving to be difficult. Many have built their lives here and integrated into the society, and work alongside Basque workers in relative harmony.\n\n Others have married Basque citizens and had children with them. As such, the most radical Aberri members calling for the expelling of maketos have been silenced for now. However, still committed to ideas of Basque supremacy, Luis Arana has instead recommended that a program of converting these Spaniards to the Basque society will be formed. Euskaran will be enforced on the maketos, and they will be strongly encouraged to change their Spanish names to instead utilize the translated variations originally coined by Sabino Arana and other Basque linguists. Over time, it is hoped, the Spanish surnames will become a brand of their own, to tell all good citizens of Euskadi that the person comes from a line of impure, inferior colonizers who would withhold Basques from their God-ordained sovereignty."

BAS.57.t:0 "Aranaist Codification of Euskara"
BAS.57.d:0 "The Basque language, Euskara, is among the oldest in Europe, and it’s unique properties as an isolate have led many linguists towards researching and codifying it, from Louis Lucien Bonaparte to Miguel de Unamuno. Yet to this day, there are fierce debates and struggles within the Euskaltzaindia institute as to which ideal of the language should become the basis template of Euskaran, to serve as the very basis of the elusive Standard Euskara. Some say that the Gizupkoan dialect is a clear winner, to others the Biskaian dialect is more important. Usually these debates are not influenced by politics per se, as the institute is mostly just chaired by relatively apolitical figures.\n\n Yet now, following the victory of aberriaks in the Basque elections, the government has forced Euskaltzaindia to abandon their bickering and adopt a model based on the program of Aberri. That model was originally developed by Sabino Arana, who had attempted to snatch the leadership of Euskaltzaindia following a competition, losing to the current leader of the institute, Resurreción Maria de Azkue. Arana’s original ideas weren’t particularly revolutionary bar for the inclusion of new letters, ŕ and ĺ and the inclusion of a new orthography, though nonetheless they would help set the standard for a codified language. This would not eliminate dialects per se, as Arana thought each province deserved their own regional language, but would help with administratorial and governmental standardisation. His ideas also included the complete eradication loan words from Euskaran, to the point of changing first names and surnames and producing Basque versions of common words. The proposals of Arana are considered incredibly purist and borderline xenophobic in the scene of vascology. These news have been received with a massive storm of criticism and protests, and de Azkue has resigned from his post following the situation.\n\n Many of the complaints launched at the administration have been related to the perceived archaic nature of Arana’s original ideas, the demand to utilize his views in the process of standardization disregarding the advancements done in research of Euskara between the thirty years in between today and Arana’s death. The government and lehendakari Luis Arana have disregarded the protests, arguing that the institute has been mired by its own division and has thus not provided the results demanded of it. The government has ordered that either the new standardization is accepted, or governmental funding to the institute is cut, something that would greatly hamper its operations. It would appear that the institute is slowly and begrudgingly accepting this."

BAS.58.d:0 "The Basque nation and people of Euskal Herria are inherently united by their blood, going back millenia into the Old Europe. This small corner of the world has always belonged to Basques, and even the occupation of Spain and France from the 1200s onwards could not push the Basque people into extinction. Neither Hispanics, Muslims, Celts, Gauls nor Romans could truly bend the Basques to their will. However, to Sabino Arana and his brother Luis, the current lehendakari of Basque nation, it was always clear that from the 19th century to today, the Basque people have been degrading under the invasion of maketos, the Spaniards.\n\n According to the Aranas, the Basques have retained their purity and faith better than the Spaniards, and it is only the contact with the maketos that the Basques have started to become corrupted with the vices and deficiencies of the maketos. The traditional Basque family is not prone to the adulterous and detached habits of the maketos, clealry born out of the liberal, anarchist and socialist ideas that the Spaniards adopted. The people of Biscay, and in extension, all Basques, were not compromised by these ideas partly because of their strong faith and partly because of their more pure blood, reinforced by the isolated nature of Basque culture.\n\n Yet if an existence with Spain continued, even the advantages that the Basques possessed, would be slowly overwhelmed by the hordes of Spaniards coming to our land to earn a meager living. As such Basque people have to become isolated from further Spanish interference, to ensure that the people of Euskal Herria can maintain their superior integrity, faith, purity and morality. They have done so for centuries, and now, with the advent of independence, this separation must be upheld as the guiding principle of the Basque state. Without the untainted blood of Biskaia’s sons, the Basques are bound to suffer the fate of their neighbours."

BAS.59.d:0 "One of the greatest inspirations to the cause of Basque nationalism has been the Irish fight for sovereignty, and to both Sabino Arana and Luis Arana Goiri, the Emerald Isle has been an example of how a nation can follow republican principles while upholding its Catholic faith. Recently, diplomatic relations were formalized between the two nations as members of the Aberri government, accompanied by members from the EAJ and EMB, visited the island on a state visit. This journey merely reinforced the idea that Ireland and Euskadi are inherently linked in their similar struggles. Contacts have been formed with the Catholic democrats of Fianna Fail and their leader Eamon de Valera following the visit, and while the Irish party may not hold quite as fundamentalist view on the matter of Catholicism as the members of Aberri, the two parties have nonetheless found quite a few distinct commonalities for further cooperation.\n\n The members of the Aberri delegation thanked the Irish for their support during the independence war, and vowed to assist Ireland should it find itself besieged by the Syndicalists or heretical protestants of the north. Calling upon the anti-colonialist ideas of Sabino Arana, the delegation claimed that the Irish, sharing the past of foreign domination, are Basques’ kindred spirits, and thus only through locked shields can the young nations of the world keep themselves free. The state visit was met with much celebration, and it has further reinforced the deep reverence that the Basques have for their friends on the other side of Biskaian coast."

There are some, especially among the Aberri ultranationalists, who could be converted to see the righteousness of our cause, but most of the republicans shall stand before the judge for their actions. While the monarch’s council has urged caution when dealing with these nationalist and separatist fanatics, as pushing them too far would likely cause an insurgency against our rule, we must weed out the most republican-minded and ensure that no liberal or socialist traitor will threaten our rule.

However, while our controlled territories do host most of the Carlist patriots and loyalists of the true king, they’re not the only areas of Spain where Carlist cause was followed. In Catalonia, the movement gained ground especially in the rural areas, fighting back the hordes of godless anarchists. Areas such as Galicia, Asturias, Leon and Andalusia also had some degree of Carlist support, though not to the extent of Navarre and Catalonia. With our success at eradicating the socialist and republican elements from our nation, many Spaniards who in their hearts know our leader to be the true monarch of Spain have made the dangerous trek to our lands and pledged their allegiance to the Basque-Navarran Carlists.\n\n Prominent traditionalist politicians such as Manuel Fal Conde, José Luis Zamanillo González-Camino and the known integrist José María Lamamié de Clairac y Colina, have all arrived to Pamplona to pledge their support to the king, bolstering the Carlist government with their expertise. Military men such as Mario Muslera, José Enrique Varela and Ricardo Rada Peral have also arrived to fight alongside their comrades, ready to guide the Carlist armies to battle against their eternal rival. Funding has been provided by French nationalists and Portuguese integralists alike, especially in the form of weapons and ammunition, with Lebels and Portuguese Mauser–Vergueiros becoming a common sight among the Carlist requetes. With more loyal Carlists arriving every day to bolster our ranks, the day of the Reconquista draws nearer, the cowards at Madrid probably trembling at their boots as the entire regions of Basque country and Navarre gear up for war.

Their influence has been crushed for the most part, but among the urban folk of Bilbao and San Sebastian, it still lingers like a phantom of a terrible past. To fully purge our nation from this menace, many members of AET, the youth section of the Carlist movement, have proposed that we recreate the Sindicatos Libres union. Back in the days of the Catalan separatist movement, Sindicatos Libres became an important force to counter these separatists and their anarchists allies, working as strikebreakers and streetfighters to squash the insolent rebels. \n\nNot only were they a great example of a truly patriotic worker, who puts the idea of an unified and stable Spain over a few more coins in his purse, the Sindicatos Libres movement was, at its core, highly Carlist. While many of the lower ranking members of the movement were simply interested in the protection of religious values, for the leadership Carlism was very important, and while the influence of that waned as the movement grew less important on the Spanish scene, the movement could serve as an inspiration for the creation of a similar union here. With the help of these Sindicatos, we could push back against the reds, lowering their numbers as joining our union would keep pious workers from being radicalized by the socialist scum, as well as providing another means to fight strikers and other slackers whenever they attempted yet another action to hamper our rule. Sindicatos Libres, alongside the Requetés, have always been a source of Carlist radicalization, and their importance to the movement’s evolution cannot be understated. However, Sindicatos Libres are also very much the most proletarian part of the entire Carlist movement, and thus they are also the ones to demand actual redistribution of wealth in society, given Carlism’s promise to fight both capitalist greed and syndicalist godlessness. \n\n As such, to achieve a more equal society built within the Christian values, the leader of Sindicatos Libres, José Baró Bonet, has suggested creating an economy based on Catholic unionism, worker’s cooperatives and solidarity between different classes of society through agrarian credit organizations and banks, without stepping on the rights of private property owners too heavily. Jaime del Burgo has supported this view, but many within his Carlist circle have noted that this new Carlist syndicalism should place greater emphasis on proletarian and peasant, rejuvenation and action, aimed at dismantling the oppressive capitalist chains and merging red syndicalism with true traditionalist ideology and Spanish nationalism. This would attract more ‘reds’ into our movement, but it could result in a more radical and most importantly, more youthful movement. These ideas stem from the early days of del Burgo’s ideological evolution, where he would discuss elements of Georges Sorel’s syndicalist system in his literary circles."

What started as a group of young, reckless militants seeking to fight their ideological enemies on the urban sprawl of Spain’s cities. Inspired in part by the French Camelots du Roi, developed by our ideological allies in Action Francaise, the movement developed to have a dual purpose of being the propaganda organ of Carlism as well as the muscle needed to reign in Carlism’s many opponents.\n\n While requetes weren’t the only militia force of Carlism, with the Sindicatos Libres unions also helping cull the numbers of revolutionary anarchists immensely, Requetés soon developed to be the most prominent Carlist organisation of violent purpose. When the movement grew into more action-oriented direction, and as Carlists began to plot the end of the Spanish republic and the Alfonsist regime that followed it, the Requetés became a veritable force on their own, getting formal training from traditionalist-minded officers and soldiers, armed with weapons smuggled from Portugal and Austria by like-minded radical Catholics.\n\n The movement also left the many urban centres of Spain, focusing more on the rural common man, more willing to defend the sacred values of Carlism than the more liberal-minded urbanites who have long ago turned their backs on both God and Eternal Spain in the pursuit of false gods of capitalism and syndicalism. The Navarran and Basque provinces provided the best grounds for the expansion of Erreketes, and many pious Basque men joined the brigades of Erreketes to fight for the one true king of Spain.

The matter of education has been raised by especially those members of the Carlist organisation who are born Basque, and they have questioned whether the king will uphold his promise to honour the Basque rights to autonomy, especially in regards to the Basque language. Ever since the independence of Basque Country, the republicans greatly expanded the ikastolak system, a network of schools around the nation that primarily teach in Basque. They were originally created in protest of the secularisation of schools under the republic and the aloof attitude of Catholic schools towards the Basque language question in local schools. While they’re not under the rule of the church, these institutions are just as pious as those run by the clergy, and Catholic faith is as present there as everywhere else in Basque country. With just minor adjustments to their program, such as the reintroduction of clergymen and church officials such as deacons into the teacher roster, we could convert this inherently Basque form of education to better serve the Carlist cause and make sure that schools are not only educational in sciences but also in morality and piety. Obviously any mentions of the Euskadi republic and its government, other parties and rest of the devious liberal ideas must be eradicated as well, to be replaced with the celebration of Carlist cause, patriotic education to children and youth alike, and teaching of the history of Basques as an integral part of Spain, unique but not separate thanks to the excellent fueros system!"

Despite the three Carlist wars and numerous smaller conflicts to depose the Alfonsine line to the throne, which all ended, more or less, in a disaster, Catalonia, Basques and to some extent Asturias and Galicia, remained fierce supporters of the true king’s cause. As we prepare for the fourth and final Carlist war, it is only fitting that Basque country, to many the very cradle of Carlism where it was nurtured and prepared for the great struggles ahead, is our very headquarters. With the pious, loyal and determined sons of Bizkaia, Gizupkoa and Navarre on our side, we can finally push out the rotten corpse of the Alfonsine lineage, burn its carcass to the ground and return the throne of eternal Spain to its only worthy owner. And for this, the Basques can return to their lands, safe in the knowledge that thanks to their sacrifice, their rights, old laws and beloved Catholic faith will never again be threatened by the tyrant, socialist or liberal, ever again.

A guard patrol was sent out on a routine route throughout the valley, where to the guard’s surprise, they found an abandoned horse cart. As they began to inspect the derelict vehicle, three unknown figures rushed out of the bushes nearby and managed to strike the soldiers down in the ensuing melee. Two of the attackers tied the guards up by the wagonside while a third man swapped his worker’s overalls to the uniform of the guard. After a brief conversation the small group split, with the uniformed man heading back towards the outpost and the two others disappearing into the woods once more. The outpost guards had already settled into a drowsy routine, bored after so many weeks of sitting idle in these mountains. As they saw a man return, in similar uniform to theirs, the sentry simply panned towards him once with the searchlight and told the approaching man to state his business. The man replied that he had come back to visit the toilet after an uneventful patrol, and the sentry, not suspecting foul play given his boredom and general lack of things happening up here on the Pyrenean mountains, was about to pass him by. However, for a split second, a thought crossed his mind that something about the man’s voice had not been the same as those in guard duty."

BAS.73.t:0 "Death of the Syndicalist Revolution"
BAS.73.d:0 "The streets of Bilbao were finally becoming cleaner as rain washed away the grime and filth left over from the large battle, fought less than a week ago. The anarchist flags, hoisted over the buildings of the mighty coastal city, waved lazily in the wind. The city had been caught in a lethargic mood, as the final celebrations of the CNT-FAI victory had  died down and the fishermen turned anarchist revolutionaries realized the scope of their new duties. Already many among their ranks had simply deserted and returned home, leaving only the most ideologically motivated or opportunistic to pick over the carcass of the Basque Republic’s institutions.\n\n The cracks of the anarchist movement were beginning to show, their loose confederation of separate enclaves of coastal unionism buckling under the weight of managing a territory the size of Euskadi, and factionalism was running rampant. Now, the most capable anarchists had decided to gather a congress to nominate a temporary leader, who would act as a mediator for the various factions within the movement. As the ragged militias and union bosses gathered at the city hall of Bilbao, still covered in bullet holes from the revolt, their congress could begin.\n\n However, mere moments after the nomination of Justo Garate Arriola as the mediator, a sharp cry from outside the city hall captured everyone’s attention. The few anarchist guards left outside the main hall opened fire on something, but the grunts of pain soon revealed them to be on the receiving end of bullets. The anarchists gathered in the hall attempted to react, when bullets began peppering the building and hand grenades flew into the space from both inside and outside the building. The sound of explosions made the few city blocks around the city hall tremble, and in the five minutes the exchange of fire had taken place in, the leadership of Basque CNT-FAI was utterly wiped out.\n\n A man in his mid-30s, dressed in the simple monos overalls of Iberian workers, entered the room, flanked by bodyguards in similar suits. The only distinguishing feature on their clothes was a symbol similar to those used by the French Jacobins over the northern border. The leading man, Jesús Larrañaga observed the carnage for a second before marching across the destroyed hall to the podium and addressing his men, members of the Partido Comunista de Euzkadi. In a room littered by corpses, where blood slowly seeped into the wooden planks below, the Jacobin revolution of Iberia had begun."

The anarchists had done most of the work with the liberals and nationalists, so as the Jacobins settled into their new role as the rulers of Euskadi, their governance was mostly uncontested. Jesus Larrañaga had spent the last days leading the men on storming actions or figuring out the logistics of the Jacobin takeover, using every drop of strength in his body to make his dream of a Basque country under the Jacobins a reality. But as news arrived of a French ship docking at the Bilbao harbour, his enthusiasm rekindled. A company of hardliner Jacobin Basques and Spaniards, trained in French Basque country, stepped into the dock, armed to the teeth with French rifles, submachine guns and pistols. After them, the true Red Lehendakari arrived.\n\n Leandro Carro Hernaez, one of the original founders of the now defunct Partido Comunista Española, had been exiled to France by the royal regime almost two decades ago. Now, his men had returned, and instead of the Leninist-inspired communists of the 1920s, the EPK would bring true Red Jacobinism to Euskadi and beyond. As Hernaez congratulated Larrañaga on his victory, the younger man handed over the reins of the new state to Hernaez. With their leader finally in the country itself, the build-up of Euskadi into something greater could begin, unshackled by reactionary superstition and harmful nationalism."

BAS.75.d:0 "In the start of the 1900s, the fire of communism still burned in the hearts of the ideologues of Europe, simply waiting for the moment to finally overthrow the capitalist controllers of the worker. But when the Bolsheviks were defeated by the reactionary monsters of Russia and their Kerenskyist lapdogs, and the French syndicalists toppled the bourgeois republic, the world was set on its course, that being the ideologically soft syndicalism. Here in Spain we have already seen the error of this ideology, first when the Spanish anarchists conceded defeat in the elections and once here in Euskadi when we decapitated their pathetic little movement in one fell swoop. While our French Jacobin brothers still consolidate themselves in preparation to one day overthrow the Syndicalists there, we shall begin our own work with utmost speed.\n\nThe Spectre of Communism has not haunted Europe for decades, indeed, some would say that it was properly killed off or paralyzed when the Bolsheviks were crushed. But the new “Workers’ and Peasants’ Government”, hastily assembled by Larrañaga, Hernaez and secretary-general Juan Astigarribia has decided to revive Marxist-Leninism here, to once again haunt the lands of Iberia. The party will be organised as a vanguard one, and it will integrate the few unions that Bilbao and rest of Euskadi boasts. Euskadi Roja, the party newspaper, shall be utilised to its fullest extent to educate the Basque people with our policies. The Spectre shall return, revived by Basque hand."

People are confused and angry about our religious policies, low-level officials are trying to carry out our economic and social policies but lack the understanding to do this properly, and the union representatives tend to slip back to syndicalism if left unchecked. But thankfully, we are not alone. Thanks to our short distance to the French border, Jacobin agitators and militants have crossed the border with the help of PCF sympathisers. With their help, EPK party members are getting far further in their studies and should soon be ready to properly lead our people. The military aid given by French Jacobins such as Jules Dumont has been invaluable to our efforts to build a centralized military of professionals to replace the militia-like Ertzaña. The French experts have helped us build the first building blocks of a proper intelligence agency. They’ll also help us kickstart a program that would replace the outdated Catholic beliefs that Basques hold with a proper Cult of Reason. While we do have our grievances with PCF on some matters, such as the fate of French Basque Country, it is undeniable that without their help, we couldn’t have leaped forward as quickly as a party and society. Already many Basques are proving that our revolution was necessary as they enthusiastically adopt our viewpoints under the guidance of our French allies. Many young party members, such as the promising Jacobin Youth member Ramón Ormazabal, are already quickly rising through the ranks, and will provide the party with young blood for the years to come."

BAS.80.t:0 "The Question of Iberian Leadership"
BAS.80.d:0 "With Basque troops now storming the few last military holdouts in Madrid, the defeat of the Castilian imperialists is certain. Spain lies in ruins, the rump holdings of Castile decimated by concentrated Basque advance, and with the Jacobin banners raising over Madrid, Seville and Gibraltar, the last hopes of Spanish chauvinism have been shattered. As Jacobin boots crush the last remnant of Spanish backwardness, a very real question has now risen to many lips inside our realm. The population of Euskadi is far too small to completely occupy Spain, and our intention from the start was to unite with the other communist cells in Iberia to share power in a popular federal republic. Now that former Spanish lands are united, however, many Spanish leaders have proposed holding an inner-party elections to determine who will lead the new republic.\n\n The Basque leadership has agreed to this offer, and five candidates have stepped up to contest the incumbent Leandro Carro Hernaez for the chairman’s seat. Probably the most prominent of these challengers is Dolores Ibárruri, famously known as La Pasionaria, being a strong advocate for feminism and Marxist-Leninism, and also of Basque origin. Another Basque communist veteran is Vicente Uribe, who became well-known for both his propaganda skills during the war, and the laws he pushed to help the situation of farmers and rural smallholders, earning him much fame among Spain’s rural folk. Representing the youth wing of the Jacobins is José Cazorla Maure, leaving the shadow of his mentor Carillo. His reputation is somewhat hampered by the harsh crackdowns he performed during the war against Spain, though his connection with the radical youth wing of the party has earned him many votes. \n\nThe candidate of our armed forces is Enrique Lister, known for being a talented militia leader during the war, and while he runs a platform of increased military control and militarisation, he is known to exhibit some internationalist and agrarian tendencies as well. Finally, the dark horse in the race is unquestionably Andres Nin, a follower of the Trotsky doctrine of internationalism and leader of Izquierda Comunista de España, he is the only candidate to not be part of Spanish communist party.

BAS.81.t:0 "The Question of French Leadership"
BAS.81.d:0 "As Basque troops raise the Jacobin banners over Parisian roofs and the dust settles, many Communards can hardly believe their eyes. Yet with every passing day, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the Jacobin rule is here to stay, with the Communards exhausted from their fight against the Germans and their country ruined from the two front war. However, as the Basque commune’s leadership has announced its dedication towards creating an unified Ibero-French Jacobin Commune, many French Jacobins are now demanding that we honour our commitment to the cause and remember their sponsorship of our regime so many years ago by allowing their representatives to also compete for party leadership.\n\n Should we agree upon their request, the candidates most likely to win would be either the leader of Parti communiste français, Maurice Thorez, or the representative of the National Jacobins faction, Jacques Doriot. While Doriot follows an ideology quite different from the Red Jacobinism which Basque Jacobins subscribe to, he is nonetheless an important figure of French Jacobinism and thus not easy to sideline.\n\n Both Marcel Cachin and  Jacques Duclos have also announced their bids for the leadership, Marcel Cachin banking on his reputation as one of the founders of PCF while Duclos has apparently decided to step out of the shadow of Thorez as one of the main ideologues leading PCF in the period between Weltkriegs. While these two candidates do not appear to have as high a chance of winning the nomination, they still lead the last candidate to appear by a wide margin, that being Andre Marty. Being a former Jacobin, his expulsion from the party led him to Basque country, and without his help our revolution may very well have been thwarted. His aggressive and brutal methods have earned him quite a bit of infamy in Iberia, and while his chances of victory are slim, many fear the reign that he would bring to the new union of Iberia and France."

BAS.82.t:0 "Curious Flotsam"
BAS.82.d:0 "As dusk enveloped the sky over Biscayan coast, one of the last fishing trawlers was slowly chugging towards the shore, returning from a successful day’s work. As the piers of San Sebastian came into view, the sky began to darken in turn, and a torrential rainstorm began to churn the sea below. So close to the shore, the boat had no real danger, but the boat crew spotted an even smaller vessel that would not be as lucky, should the storm continue. A man in a tiny inflatable dinghy was closing towards the city, his boat tossing and turning in the raging sea, and the boat’s captain made the decision to help him. As the fishing vessel closed in to save the man, his dinghy capsized, plunging the old man into the water. Only the quick actions of the deckhands saved his life, and soon he was dragged out of the water. The deckhands were treated by a bemusing sight, as an old, bearded Asian man with a clear dogged determination burning in his eyes stared back at them.\n\n The man’s backstory remained a mystery as the Basque fishermen did not speak any of the languages the man did, although they could understand few of the French words he said. With this limited communication, the fishermen took him to the local headquarters of the Basque Communist Party, where a few of the officials could converse with the stranger in French. To their surprise, the man claimed to be Ho Chi Minh, one of the founders of Parti communiste français and a hero of the Indochinese resistance struggle. Hearing of our bravery against the Spanish imperialists and the following struggle to reclaim the Jacobin homeland, he decided to return from his self-imposed exile and announce his bid for the leadership of French and Iberian Jacobins.\n\n The news sent the new union of communist states into a frenzy, as the leaders of Spanish, Basque and French Jacobins are struggling to come to grips with the peculiarity of this proclamation. Nonetheless, many Basques sympathize with Ho Chi Minh, finding his anti-colonial struggle more relatable than the French state that up until recently held very anti-regionalist views. The strange arrival also holds quite a bit of legitimacy due to his role in forming the PCF, much to the dismay of French Jacobins."

BAS.83.t:0 "The New Direction of Aranaism"
BAS.83.d:0 "Now that the Mendigoixales have fully left the dusty and backwards ranks of Aberri, and even triumphed in the elections against all odds, it is time to leave behind the baggage of Sabino Arana’s more reactionary beliefs. The titan of Basque nationalism was undoubtedly a master without equal, but his ideas are still those aligned with the Spanish right. For all his nationalism and fervour, his tools for creation of Basque state were limited and his ideas tied to faith. Under the guidance of Gudari, lehendakari Elias Gallastegi, Basques will learn that only through socially conscious, youthful and at times, borderline revolutionary approach can Basques reach their true potential. The Mendigoxales will preach the words of Arana but modified to fit the new era, where old ideas such as Arana’s ideological basis, Integrism, are simply old fashioned and obsolete, while new ideas from some of Gallastegi’s role models, such as Gandhi, Sandino, Martí and Abd el Krim, allow Euskadi to truly face the challenges of modernity. Mendigoxales will mix the ideas of left-wing progressivism, without necessarily adopting the more Marxist thoughtforms, while holding the Catholic values and nationalist fire inherent to the life of Basques. The new model citizen of this great nation will be a devout patriot willing to do his civic duties without being bogged down by ideological nonsense of the left or right, unwilling to bow down to atheist demagogues clad in red or the capitalist exploiters claiming to uphold God’s word. EMB under Gallastegi will forge a new path for Euskadi’s youth, one that will rekindle this new nation to an inferno of nationalism and true comradery of patriotic brotherhood."
BAS.83.a:0 "Gora Euskadi!"

BAS.84.t:0 "The Doctrine of Self-Sacrifice"
BAS.84.d:0 "When the war against Spain began, the Mendigoxales formed the first line of defence, marching to battle holding old hunting rifles and weapons looted off the Spanish dogs of Guardia Civil. There, the units formed out of our party members, the young and inexperienced patriots of Euskadi, fought off regular Spanish army forces, though with a price. The organization of Mendigoxales was devastated, and the president of the EMB, Mikel Alberdi, was slain in battle. This sacrifice must serve as a guiding line to the Mendigoxales going forward. The concept of sacrifice does not need to only be attributed to the sacrifice of one’s life, but the service of the Basque republic is inevitably going to require each and every Mendigoxale’s personal sacrifices. For the party leader Gallastegi, these were clear tenets of anti-colonial liberation from a young age, as he read the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi and Augustus Sandino. Sacrifice of oneself’s different attributes, be they temporary, such as suffering in prison or during  a hunger strike to drive a point of a protest home, is one way. The sacrifice of one’s life, as terrible as it is, is sometimes also required from true patriots. Every member of EMB must realize that without true sacrifices in many different ways, the republic that they cherish might not exist. This does not mean that EMB encourages reckless or suicidal behaviour among its men, only that they must realize within themselves the disciple to carry out the sacrifices needed to be suffered at the given situation. Many Basques have done so before, and many will inevitably do so in the future, but the true independence and prosperity of Euskadi depends on these selfless acts. To this end, every Mendigoxale must become capable of physically and mentally facing the challenges of the future, through rigorous physical exercising. The new party will include some of the long marches and hikes performed during its less formal days of early mountaineering. Healthy living and connection to Basque life and culture will be a requirement of all mendigoixales, as Gallastegi wants to bring back a tradition of using hiking as a means of connecting the mendigoixales to their local community. In this way, the members of the party better understand the reason for their sacrifices, and their nationalist fervour can bloom to new heights."

BAS.85.t:0 "Implementation of Gastetxus"
BAS.85.d:0 "The idea of Basque ikastola, a school dedicated to the preservation and expansion of Basque culture and language among the Basque children, first formed to counter secularism promoted by Republican Spain, is an excellent one in the eyes of Mendigoixale leadership as well. However, elements of the EMBs women’s section, Aberri Emakume Batza, have promoted an addition to the great federation of ikastolak, named Aberri Gastetxu Ikastola. AGI would go even deeper into patriotic education, teaching Basque songs, dances and theatre to them, and hopefully, in time and with the right amount of experimentation, the AGI system would be implemented into the usual program of the ikastolak. The organization will be administered by Aberri Gastetxu Batza, who is chaired by various members of Aberri Emakume and some of the older members of EMB who might have cultural or pedagogical roots. Some members of EMB have even recommended implementing hikes and mountaineering to the program, creating a sort of easy transition to the wider party organization as the children would be familiar with the Pyrenean mountains. There is, however, a debate on whether AGIs should be a party organ meant to educate the children in EMB’s political platform in a relatively understandable way, or whether AGI should be primarily a cultural tool meant to push an understanding, and even love of the Basque culture and all of its aspects within the children, making it perhaps easier to be incorporated into the ikastola system without too much protests from the other parties. In other matters of education the EMB supports staff and command."

BAS.86.t:0 "The Question of EMB’s Identity"
BAS.86.d:0 "Since their inception in the first decade od 20th century, the Basque Mendigoixales have been heavily linked to the conservatives of Basque political scene. First, they served as the propaganda wing and clandestine recruitment methods of Eusko Alderdi Jeltzae and then, when the party split, as a strong portion of the Eusko Alderdi Aberri. However, when the influence of Elias Gallastegi grew within the Aberri group, the traditionalist entrenchment resisting his ideas did as well, resulting in even further splintering as Gallastegi took his Mendigoixales with him. The integrists and ultra-conservatives of Aberri would go on to continue existing, but the election victory of Eusko Mendigoixale Batza was clear sign that the new generation of Basque patriots want fresh ideas. These new patriots, or aberzales as they’re known as a more general term for younger patriots not affiliated with EAJ, have a distinctly left-wing tint to them, not the secular godlessness of Spanish syndicalists but with the mindset that all Basques should be equal and not slaves to neither red authoritarianism nor yellow capitalism. As such, many members of EMB have suggested different ideas for a new party doctrine. The prevailing idea is to drift leftwards and follow the example of our inspiration, Sinn Fein, though some also claim that EMB should simply incorporate non-Marxist socialism and syndicalist tendencies into the movement as well. However, many of the original members who moved over from Aberri think that the party should instead focus on creating a truly nationalist movement, pushing for the greatest possible state, with strategic alliances to the socialists and left-wing abertzales, with those parties helping us build more equal state as coalition partners. We could also simply retain the current party status quo, though how well that is received by the party members remains to be seen, with many fearing that the more socialist-leaning elements will simply move on to EAS and EAE, while the nationalists would rejoin Aberri. Ultimately, the decision is in the hands of Elias Gallastegi, as his word has the most weight within the party."
BAS.86.a:0 "We must formally join our compatriots on the left and adopt socialist leanings."

BAS.87.t:0 "The End of Robber Baron Rule"
BAS.87.d:0 "When EMB was formed for the first time in 1924, its central mission was simply to spread the love of a Basque homeland to the people of this great region. However, as the movement has become dominated by the young patriots of the nation, it has gathered an extensive amount of patriots who want more than the promises of elite-led welfare that the EAJ provides. Gallastegi himself has never been a friend of capital, going as far as to sympathize with the Basque communists in the early 1930s following their arrests. Capitalism, according to EMB, is a foreign infiltration of traditional Basque society, brought upon the nation through Spanish laws and customs. The society of Euskal Herria must be collectivized, to distribute the resources of our small nation evenly. This does not mean that there cannot be private property, and indeed, EMB respects that people do require it for the society to function. However, when private property exist to grant others lordship over less fortunate, and when it directly interferes with national security and societal order, it must be removed from the hands of those who abuse it. For the rest of Euskadi’s citizenry, they will be granted the greatest degree of autonomy in the use of their private property. Ownership will be transferred to the local communities and co-operatives, allowing workers to control their own production without needless masters. There will be democratically chosen company boards to facilitate leadership, and capital storage in banks will be managed by the state after banks are nationalized. However, the state under EMB does not plan to hold on to these properties, but instead ownership of the banks is transferred to co-operatives as well. EMB does not believe in government control of industries or companies, for the Mendigoxales the role of government is simply to ensure harmony within the economy  To the Mendigoixales, the dual evils of imperialism and capitalism must be weeded out from Basque society. Imperialism enslaves people, as seen in German and other European colonial projects around Asia and Africa. Capitalism subjugates men, making them little more than servants and forcing them to carry the burdens of the fickle market, as seen in the American collapse. An Euskadi free of these corruptive elements is within EMB’s grasp, and to achieve it, a program of relatively gentle but firm transition must be implemented. Gallastegi and other party leaders do not wish to violently shake up the social order overnight, but the current status quo must break if the free Basque nation is to finally rid itself from the chains of the Hispanic past."
BAS.87.a:0 "Down with imperialism, down with capitalism!"

BAS.88.t:0 "Republic of the People"
BAS.88.d:0 "While the Mendigoxales have taken a stance for the division of labour and leadership in worker circles, much of their most radical ideas relate to the implementation of a land reform. EMB plans country-wide land seizure, where communal land is returned to Basque villages and municipalities without compensation. The government of Euskadi will not retain ownership of these farmhouses, silos or other infrastructures related to agriculture, but instead the communal and private property will work together to supplement the needs of the community. This will allow landed farmers to retain their holdings, as long as they are capable of farming them on their own, while providing land for tenant farmers to continue their profession without inhuman leases or rents burdening them. Similarly, artisans and other small-scale producers will be allowed to keep their private property as long as it does not hinder communal operations of Basque citizens. The seizure of land is mostly aimed at those who would seek to hoard land and utilize it as a blackmail tool on the tenants, a system far too common in Iberia due to the presence of caciquismo and other local landlord oligarchies. While the issue is less present in Euskadi than in Catalonia and elsewhere, it is still an issue that will be swiftly addressed by the EMB. As for less obvious cases, the party prefers not to seize land if there is no intention of ill gain, as hunting down every single individual with even a morsel of excess land would be counterproductive. As with industrial and commercial sectors, the Mendigoxales support the creation and continued utilization of agricultural unions, and there has even been attempts to court the Eusko Nekazari Alkartasuna, an agricultural daughter union of the larger worker’s syndicate Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna. ENA was highly enthusiastic supporter of independence before the war against Spain, but their connection to the EAJ remains relatively strong, and thus they are unlikely to fully commit to the cause of EMB, though they may prove to be useful allies in the ongoing agrarian reform."

The social nationalists of Euskadi have transformed the state into a modern representation of the Basque people, torn out of the obsolete and chafing shell of Aranaism while keeping the traditional customs and pillars of Basque society. Foreign inventions that serve to only enslave the free men and women of Euskal Herria, such as capitalism, have been wiped away to give way to a new dawn for the common man of the young nation. Elias Gallastegi, for his part, has been able to live up to the promises he set for EMB to fulfill, and while much work must be done for the program of EMB to truly reach the heights it aimed for, the complete metamorphosis of the humble mountaineering organization into one of the titans of both Basque politics and parliamentarism alike has already convinced many that the party will climb the remaining obstacles all the same. Just as the Mendigoxales of yore scaled the mighty mountains of the Pyrenees, so too will EMB guide its people onwards towards even greater and greater heights now."

However, as Aguirre was returning from a recent EAJ rally in Alava province, the convoy of Ertzana guards and couple cars with Jeltzale politicians was struck by a lone assailant, who managed to pepper Aguirre’s vehicle with bullets before falling to the guns of Ertzana. The driver of the vehicle had been saved from the bullets but many penetrated the passenger cabin and struck lehendakari Aguirre and the minister of interior, Jesús María Leizaola, who were rushed to the nearby hospital for emergency surgery. The assailant was later confirmed to be a radicalized Spanish worker with ties to the Liga de Acción Monarquica, and the policemen of Ertzana are currently hunting down his associates all over Euskal Herria. Leizaola survived the encounter, though his time of recovery is expected to be long. However, as the hours roll by and the situation of lehendakari Aguirre’s health remain unknown outside of medical personnel.

BAS.95.d:0 "With the death of Jose Antonio Aguirre, the situation of Basque leadership remains open. Some within Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea and other parties recommend holding new elections to determine the new lehendakari, but most others recommend appointing a new face to the position of lehendakari. The current ministers have decided to drop out of the race due to various reasons, with Jesús María Leizaola, the most likely successor to Aguirre, being wounded in the fateful ambush and thus incapable of taking the reins. Manuel de Irujo, a great compromiser and a native of Navarre, represents the more liberal wing of Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea and has been instrumental in facilitating connections between the moderate socialists of EAS and EAE. His progressive outlook might alienate those few traditionalists who have yet to jump ship to join the Aberriak, but his ideas might revitalize EAJ towards a new destiny. A more status quo candidate would be Cándido María Saseta Echebarria, a well-known war hero who led the organization of Eusko Gudarostea during the independence war and while he is expected to mostly follow Aguirre’s line of governance, Saseta is likely to use his military man status in a quite populist manner. Finally, as a somewhat dark horse candidate is the famed social engineer of Mondragon, priest José María Arizmendiarrieta, who has only been tending the parish of Mondragon for a short while but already has plenty of ideas on how to turn it into a pious, co-operative and socially conscious paradise of the Catholic workers. Riding on his popularity in the town, he has appeared as something of a technocratic candidate, taking his ideas of Mondragon into state-level. While an unlikely candidate to win, his victory would radically change the trajectory of EAJ’s policies, and it would likely earn it much sympathy within the traditionally socialist workers of Eibar and Mondragon."

As such, there has been a search for a man to replace him, and the most liked option so far is the popular union leader Manu Roblez Aranguiz. Leading the splinter union section of Aberri that split from the larger Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna, Roblez has become a fierce protector of Basque tradition, and he is noted for his solid work on keeping the syndicalists and socialists out of Basque union movement. While it is not certain that Luis Arana is going to withdraw from his position of leadership, the party seems to support Roblez for the position should such an event happen, though his ascension to the head of the party would likely see it adopt a more right-wing syndicalist turn. However, while Arana has hinted at stepping down, only the man himself knows if he will do so."

BAS.111.t:0 "The One True King?"
BAS.111.d:0 "The time has come for del Burgo to end his regency of Navarre, and crown the true king of Spain, the legitimate pretender to the legacy of Carlos VII, whose right to the throne was denied by the scheming Isabelline traitors. Most of the Carlist cause supports the right of Javier de Bourbon-Parma, the current regent, for the throne of Spain, but Jaime del Burgo is one of the most fervent opponents to his claim. Del Burgo claims that Carlos V, during his role, established a new dynasty, one Javier is not part of, and thus is not fit to rule. Del Burgo is instead one of the fiercest supporters of the cruzadistas or carloclavistas, supporters of the Austrian Don Carlos Pio to be the new king of Spain. However, Carlos Pio has expressed a degree of hesitation in becoming the king of a minor Iberian region, especially one that has divided the opinions of local Carlists to a degree rarely seen before.\n\n Should del Burgo persist, it is likely that Carlos Pio would agree and travel to Navarre to be crowned Carlos VIII, king of Spain, but his initial hesitation has made del Burgo somewhat ambivalent to the Austrian noble. This is partially because the Requetés have unexpectedly pledged support for another candidate, Cayetano María José Pío de Borbón-Parma y Braganza, brother of Don Javier, who technically has a claim to the throne through his kinship to the now dead previous pretender Don Jaime de Bourbon-Parma. Cayetano gained prominence among the Carlists after he volunteered to fight for the Navarrans during the war against Spain, fought valiantly in the frontlines and defensive actions against Spanish troops entering Gernika, defending the sacred oak of the town and paying heavily for it after he was wounded by a grenade fragment.\n\n He has since healed, and his war hero status has elevated him to eclipse the popularity of his brother Javier among local Carlists. Given that Don Javier has renounced his support for del Burgo’s fiefdom and decidedly sided with the old guard, the new Kingdom of Navarra could simply bypass the rival regent and crown Cayetano. Cayetano has not expressed much interest to the throne, but he could be pressured to accept it, should del Burgo decide that the half-hearted support of Carlos Pio makes him ineligible to be given the crown of Spain.

BAS.112.t:0 "Direction of Young Carlism"
BAS.112.d:0 "With the grip of Carlist radicals tightening on these lands off the Biscay coast, the movement has taken the Basque society by storm. The anarchists and republicans who once stood as del Burgo’s greatest rivals have been driven to rout, their pitiful resistance cut down and some stragglers with a limited degree of productivity reintegrated back into the local society to redeem themselves. The Navarran stronghold of Pamplona has experienced a surge in cultural and political developments as it has developed to rival Bilbao and Donostia in importance. But as the young Carlists consolidate their rule, the previously free-form ideology of del Burgo’s disciples begins to falter. The Carlist ranks have been reinforced heavily by new converts, Spanish volunteers and enlightened old guard Carlists who now support the cause of the movement once more. While the central tenets of near theocratic belief in Catholicism, fervent monarchism and a compassionate hand towards regionalists stands firm within the ranks of del Burgo’s crusaders, there is a degree of confusion as to which direction the fledgling force should turn from here, now that they control a fiefdom of their own.\n\n Del Burgo, citing his connections to Mexican allies and former brothers-in-arms, has suggested that the movement learns from the ideology of the Mexican synarchists, who embody both the traditionalist and revolutionary conservative wings, creating a synthesis that is not too dissimilar to del Burgo’s own idea of revolutionary Carlism. This idea is supported by the unionists within the new Carlist strain, such as José María Olazábal Zaldumbide, leader of the new Navarran Sindicatos Libres, though Olazábal has suggested that we may simply adopt Spanish ideas of the Sindicatos Libres without the Mexican ideals attached to it. Others, especially those with a far more millenarian approach to the Carlist emphasis of Catholic faith, claim that the young movement should follow in the footsteps of the Romanian Iron Guard, a long-time inspiration for del Burgo’s Carlist circle of students, in creating a truly Legionary state that can withstand the upcoming Armageddon.\n\n A fringe part of the movement also supports adopting the ideas of Social Credit, claiming that the redistribution of wealth offered in that mode of economic idea could be applied to the social Catholic model in Spain and Navarra. This inclusion mainly stems from del Burgo’s fascination with the English writer T.S. Eliot, who is an avid supporter of the British Social Credit system. Finally, we could adopt del Burgo’s esoteric ideas of Catholic crusader spirit as an official party ideology, though this is bound to lead to public controversy. However, some claim that departing from Carlism itself would cause the movement of del Burgo to break apart and become indistinguishable from the other, flavourless monarchist movements in Spain, and thus they advocate that Carlism, and Carlism alone, even in its new radical form advocated by del Burgo, should be the guiding light of the local movement."

BAS.113.t:0 "Question of Aberrianos"
BAS.113.d:0 "The Aberrianos of Biscay are, in the eyes of Jaime del Burgo, his great arch-nemesi, given that their leader Luis Arana is the brother of wretched Sabino Arana, the father of Basque nationalism. These two men have done so much harm to the cause of Navarran and Álavan peoples by enforcing their centralist ideology of a one Basque race, seeking separation from Spain and pushing hard against the poor Spanish workers who came to Biscay in search of a better life in the turn of the century. Yet while the Arana brothers are spawns of the devil who will continue to sow the seeds of secession and racial delusion into the minds of Basques as long as their hateful writings are allowed to circulate, many within the Aberrianos are not corrupted to the same degree.\n\n They may be Basque nationalists, yes, but they are mostly made up of Intergrists, disillusioned Carlists and devout Catholics, who represent the very best of Iberia when it comes to living according to the pious values of the Bible. While they may have been led astray by the likes of Luis Arana, they may still see the light of true Carlism. They are still mostly made up of old guard Integrists and Carlists, so integrating them into del Burgo’s movement may not be beneficial, but these old goats may still be useful to serve the cause of the True King by supporting the Requetes financially, holding expert positions and working in advisory roles in local societies. However, del Burgo himself is not necessarily thrilled about working with Basque nationalists, and he could still call the whole thing off should his long-time feud with the coastal folk prove too much for the leader of young Carlists to reconcile."

BAS.114.t:0 "Honouring Carlist Promises to Peasants"
BAS.114.d:0 "The Carlists have traditionally held a rather paternalistic view on the peasantry, beholden to their support in the numerous Carlist wars yet not particularly concerned with the rights and conditions of the local farmers and farmhands. The old guard has obviously always claimed to care deeply for the conditions of these poor folk, and whenever the Carlists were able to gain seats in local elections, they would create local programs to deal with rural issues. Nonetheless, the fact that most Carlist leaders were well-past their prime and had amassed quite a bit of wealth and property meant that they were quick to turn a blind eye to their supposed greatest enemies, the grandees of grain, the pestilence of Spain’s countryside, caciquismo. These local bosses would hold Spain’s democracy hostage for half a century and create network of corruption, graft and coercion that reached its tendrils all over Spain.\n\n Some Carlists even partook in this network, clearly showing the weakness of the old ways. Del Burgo’s reanimated Carlism has finally sought to destroy this travesty by directly attacking these hoarders of wealth. The Republican ideas of agrarian reform were wholly rejected by the Carlist old guard, with the likes of José Lamamié and Jaime Chicharro defending their ill-gotten landowner goods like jealous dragons sitting atop their mounds of gold. For a supposed movement of the peasants, this is wholly unacceptable, and del Burgo has sought to rectify it, tearing down large estates piece by piece until every peasant is free. Here in Euskal Herria and Navarra, the situation is thankfully not as bad as in places like Andalusia and Extremadura, where the large latifundios dominate the landscape and keep thousands, if not millions of peasants, locked into servitude where they must toil away under incredibly unfavourable conditions, unsure if their pay will last over the long months of unemployment that such seasonal work carries with it.\n\n Here in the northern corner of Iberia, the Basques have long cultivated a system of private ownership of land, held by independent farmers and peasants, their minifundios not producing the large hauls of grain that the likes of La Mancha’s and Castile’s latifundios may, but the Basque system is nonetheless much more fair to the farmer. There are, nonetheless, many large landowners even here, and their estates await redistribution, for the national well-being demands it. With new farms made available at relatively low price to Basques and Navarrans, this may lead to a degree of ruralization, driving people away from the godless cesspits of Bilbao and San Sebastian towards a more traditional and pious way of life. As for the plutocrat landowners, they will simply have to cope with losing their wealth, for their days of hoarding are now over."

BAS.115.t:0 "Del Burgo’s Millenarian Catholicism"
BAS.115.d:0 "Jaime del Burgo Torres was raised in a Carlist and deeply Catholic household, and his home was one of the central places of Catholic meetings in the city of Pamplona, visited regularly by high-ranking members of the local clergy as well as deeply devout lay Christians. While operating alongside as part of the Carlist youth organization Juventud Jaimista, del Burgo continued his spiritual growth, and his attitudes towards religion were greatly influenced by both of these two forums of Catholic discourse. In his home, the Catholic meetings would often reach fervent, even frenzied states, and the form of Catholicism young del Burgo came to know was far from the relatively down-to-earth and mundane religion professed by the Basques. The Catholic faith of del Burgo’s youth was one of millenarian visions, calling for a renewal in the Spanish faith before it would be too late, his religious teachers being made up of Catholic mystics and esoteric figures of the local and national scene.\n\n As such, it is hardly a surprise that the Catholicism professed by the new young Carlists of Círculo Carlista de Pamplona is similarly fierce, bordering on Christian extremism and fundamentalism. To del Burgo, the fight against republicanism, syndicalism and false monarchism is a grand new Crusade, nothing more and nothing less, a Holy War to reclaim Spain from the infidels. Like the Navarrans of the past, who drove the Moors to the sea and beyond, back to Africa, the sword of Pamplona shall crush the heathens as the crusade sweeps southwards. Del Burgo may not share many of the ideas of the Integrists, but his view on religion is highly similar, seeing the final war against his movements enemies as the final chance to redeem Spain.\n\n However, this esoteric and violent view on Catholicism has not gone unnoticed by the subjects of the new Carlist state, and some within del Burgo’s own movement, such as the priest Alvaro del Portillo, one of AET’s most promising new minds and a member of the newly ordained Opus Dei organization, has questioned whether del Burgo’s ‘crusade’ is one stemming from noble intentions or a vengeful and vitriolic justification to mete out perverse justice against the perceived enemies of del Burgo. This has caused some within del Burgo’s inner circle to advise him against showing the more extreme forms of exaltation that del Burgo’s personal faith possesses, though others argue that the leader’s enthusiasm and fiery faith is exactly the type of strong Catholicism that is needed to save Spain from its impending doom."

BAS.116.t:0 "The Carlist Collective Psychosis Healed"
BAS.116.d:0 "The Carlist cause was quite close to merging with that of the Alfonsists in 1931, when negotiations between king Alfonso and Count of Rodezno for the recognition of Don Juan, Alfonso’s son, as the legitimate king of both dynastic branches, seemed to progress well. However, the betrayal of Sanjurjada temporarily revitalized the dynastic rivalry, and it was only the crises of 1936 that led to the return towards rapprochement. The split in the Carlist Communion did not really have time to develop before the separatist revolt happened, and the Basque fight for independence laid the scars of this rapprochement doctrine bare for all to see. \n\nThousands of Carlists, fanning the embers of hatred towards the Alfonsists to an inferno, fought alongside their republican Basque rivals to exact vengeance on their hated foes in Madrid, while the Carlist elite either sat on the fence about the whole thing or even betrayed their own comrades in Navarre and beyond by siding with the Alfonsists. Jaime del Burgo had always been opposed to dynastic reunification, claiming that the Alfonsists had nothing to offer and they had broken any chance of gaining the Carlist support by breaking the promises set in 1931 anyway. When talks of approaching the Alfonsists once more resurfaced in 1936, del Burgo denounced these as a ‘collective psychosis of the Carlist movement’, claiming that the old guard had lost all hope of contesting their rivals and thus, the will to fight for the legitimate king.\n\n Del Burgo was additionally propelled to this conclusion by the increased presence of regent Javier de Bourbon-Parma as the leader of the Carlists, seeing Javier’s claim to the Carlist throne as illegitimate. Now that del Burgo leads the strongest Iberian strain of Carlism, he has vowed to purge the movement of such possibilist scum. Under the young firebrand, there will be no unity between the dynastic branches, the Alfonsine pretenders will be driven from their throne in Madrid and the legitimate king crowned in their place, the lineage restored at last. And the Carlists that dared to turn their backs to their Navarran comrades during the rightful rebellion will suffer the same fate as the Alfonsine scum, for they have no place among the crusaders for glorious restoration."

BAS.117.t:0 "The Sons of Carlos Converge on Pamplona"
BAS.117.d:0 "The horns of battle have been heard all over Spain, and while the Carlist cause is highly divided over who they support, the cause of Jaime del Burgo and his Círculo Carlista de Pamplona has certainly attracted attention. Members of Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista especially are flocking to the banner of Navarre, and Requetés have sworn their swords and rifles to our cause, joining the local Errekete militias in droves. The arrival of national leader of AET, José María Zaldívar, was especially important to the cause, as while Jaime del Burgo remained in charge due to his knowledge of the local customs and overall success in establishing a kingdom worthy of the legitimate king, Zaldivar’s presence gave the movement a degree of legitimacy. \n\nSimilarly, while many old guard Carlists have watched del Burgo’s efforts with increased concern, claiming that the young Carlist is bastardizing the very foundations of the near century old movement, many old fighters and rebels have joined our banner nonetheless. One of these men is Luis Redondo García, leader of the national Requeté forces who gained a good bit of experience during the fighting against the anarchists at the fateful times of Sanjurjada. His endorsement of the new Navarran regime is especially important, as he has multiple experienced Carlist officers under his command, such as José León Westermeyer and Ángel Prados Parejo, and his friendship with the Spanish colonel José Enrique Varela has allowed him to deliver quite a bit of weapons for us as well.\n\n Varela, despite being an officer in the Spanish army, has previously shown sympathies for the Carlist cause, and Redondo believes that he could be converted to our cause, though for now Varela has not fully committed to the fight. With these new reinforcements and resources, the Pamplonan Traditionalists are more than ready to control this little realm here at the edge of Iberia, plotting the return of the true dynastic branch."

BAS.118.t:0 "The Righteous Revolution"
BAS.118.d:0 "The words Carlist Revolution may at first glance appear to be an oxymoron, as Carlism has long been associated as the most counterrevolutionary force in Spain, denouncing even relatively conservative movements such as Christian democrats and the Castilian Acción Popular as too moderate and accommodating of the Alfonsine liberalism. However, much to the awe of the entrenched Carlist traditionalists and international observers alike, Jaime del Burgo and his small realm at the very periphery of Iberia has managed this transformation. The new kingdom is one of many contradictions, upholding its very own form of millenarian Catholic profession, ensuring the rights of local regions while also recruiting opponents of the regime into shock formations, producing a cult of brotherhood and violence while retaining a highly hands-off approach towards the Basque nationalists still existing in Biscay.\n\n The new regime, drawing from multitude of different ideologies and movements across the world, from both extreme left and right, has become something of an enigma in Iberia, and many scholars of political science and history still struggle to fully comprehend what del Burgo’s Carlism truly means. However, for the citizens of Navarre and Euskal Herria, the new movement has become a rallying banner, especially after the crowning of the true legitimate king here, and the Kingdom of Navarre now stands ready to complete the revolution and march across the border to Spain, to restore the true king once more. Del Burgo and his allies in the clergy have whipped the nation into a frenzy.\n\n Glorious examples from the history of Navarre, especially the actions of the Wolf of Las Amezcoas, general Tomás de Zumalacárregui e Imaz, leader of the Navarro-Basques in the first Carlist war, are retold in a near mythical fashion, reinforced further by other myths from later Carlist wars and the martyrs of the independence war. Never in the history of Iberia have the Carlists had as great of a chance at reclaiming their birthright, and it is all thanks to the rejuvenation driven by Círculo Carlista de Pamplona."

BAS.119.t:0 "The Provincial Library Program"
BAS.119.d:0 "The people of Spain are hard-working and pious, bar for the troublemakers and godless syndicalists of course, but for centuries the lack of literacy has held the entire peninsula back from achieving its true greatness. However, while Jaime del Burgo has assumed the leading role in bringing Carlism to Spain once more, he has other pursuits beyond the political field. His great love for literature has prompted del Burgo to push for a program aimed at eradicating illiteracy, especially through the institution of country-wide libraries and archives. The first stepping stone towards this program is the opening of Biblioteca de Navarra, an expansion of the existing Pamplonan library to scale the operations of the library to a provincial unit.\n\n In a joyous opening ceremony, the very first library card of this new institution was given to the local titan of literature, Antonio Pérez Goyena, a long-time friend of Jaime del Burgo. Before the war, when del Burgo first initiated his library program, he was considered the most likely candidate to run the new provincial institution, but given his duties leading the Navarran state, this is no longer possible. The network will be expanded further, first to the towns of Alsasua and Miranda de Arga, and then beyond. Del Burgo seeks to make literature and education available to not just upper- and middle-class citizens, but also the peasants and workers of Navarre, as with proper education and love for their country of origin, they aren’t tempted by the syndicalist vipers.\n\n In addition to libraries, del Burgo seeks to expand the network of archives and other storage spaces of information, stemming from his interest in history. With proper documentation, the deeds of the heroic fight against Alfonsists may be stored for future generations to learn from, and it will also help historians like del Burgo himself to better examine these tumultuous times in the history of Iberia. Whenever the righteous restoration is complete and the Carlist flag flies over Madrid, this network will be expanded to all of Spain, exorcising the devil of ignorance from all of Spain forevermore, but for now, Navarre serves as a prototype for this work."

BAS.120.t:0 "Guías de Navarra"
BAS.120.d:0 "The Basque republic may have attempted to bring true representation to the Basque people’s interest for the first time in world history since the assimilation of Basques to the wider Spanish nation, but their attempt was destroyed by their very own hubris. The direct attack by the Bilbao provisional government against the Navarran Carlists through the banning of the Traditionalist Communion was a betrayal of immense magnitude, and one that even the hesitant old guard of Carlists could not overlook. When the republic was crushed and del Burgo rose to lead the new Carlist cause here beneath the Pyrenean mountains, the Basques themselves have continued to resist the rule of Pamplona, with especially the abertzales of Eusko Abertzale Ekintza and the mountaineering guerillas of Eusko Mendigoxale Batza harassing our Erreketes throughout the land.\n\n However, these bandit gangs masquerading as political movements cannot resist the loyal men of Gipuzkoa, Navarre and Álava for long, as the Erreketes will sweep them aside one by one. Following the republic’s defeat, del Burgo has made great efforts to limit repressions against republicans, and has even sheltered certain high-ranking republicans from execution through direct orders to the more trigger-happy Carlist soldiers, especially in the case of men like José Antonio Aguirre and Telesforo Monzón, as especially the latter is a common target for Carlist fury, coming from a rare Basque noble family yet being one of the most fervent defenders of Basque independence. Instead of violent repressions and rule of terror, Jaime del Burgo has offered these nationalists a chance to hurt the Madrid regime they so despise by resurrecting the so called Guías de Navarra, an elite formation of Carlist troops utilized during the First Carlist War by the brilliant Navarran general Tomás de Zumalacárregui.\n\n These troops were initially made up of the most distinguished members of the Carlist forces, but as the war progressed, the make-up of these forces changed. The Guías became a force of prisoners and deserters, leaving the ranks of the Isabelline pretender’s liberal army and joining the forces of true king Carlos. Del Burgo’s new offer is to resurrect the Guías, giving a place for Basque nationalist, captured Spanish army troops and even socialists, anarchists and syndicalists to fight their most hated foe, the Spanish centralist regime in Castille. Some members of the Carlist army, especially highly conservative Carlist officer Esteban Ezcurra, have protested these measures, saying that the Reds cannot be trusted and that they should instead all be either thrown into prison to rot or be executed for their delusions. However, del Burgo remains vehement that those members of the Basque society who can still be redeemed, will do so through the fire and flames of the upcoming Reconquista."

BAS.121.t:0 "Gernikako Arbola"
BAS.121.d:0 "While the battle of Bilbao was the key point in crushing the Basque republic, a far more symbolic battle was fought in the town of Gernika, where a local militia from the Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea tried to stop the advancing Erreketes from capturing it, but were eventually driven to rout. Gernika’s significance to the Carlist movement stems from the Gernikako Arbola, the oak tree at the heart of the town. The Oak of Gernika has served as a gathering place of a political and ritual purpose since the Middle Ages, where Basques would gather to settle affairs of state and hold assemblies, leading to its eventual use as the spot for the Guernica Assembly in 1512, an assembly of the region that centralized the various smaller spots used for similar purpose, and in 1833 a hermitage house was built to represent the importance of the location. \n\nThe tree is not important merely for reasons of political centralization, but because of what it represents, the near millenia-old freedoms of the Basque people, the fueros. The oak was given far more importance when Queen Isabella II and her mother, the regent of Spain Maria Christina,  swore the oath to fueros under the tree. For the Carlists, being the defenders of fueros throughout all of Spain, the tree holds immense importance, and the new king is expected to swear his oaths under the tree soon as well. Despite what it may initially appear to be, the oak itself is not the same one that was used as a landmark during the Middle Ages, but has since gone through three different iterations following decay and death of earlier trees.\n\n The father tree, having been planted in the 14th century, lived to see four and a half centuries before its demise, when it was followed by a tree known as the ‘Old Tree’, which in turn perished in 1892, though the tree’s trunk is still preserved in a small garden near the current tree of Gernika. It is expected that once the new Carlist monarch has sworn his oath under the tree, the pacification efforts throughout the Basque republican territories will begin to wind down, for this ritual will show to the people of Euskal Herria that the Carlists, unlike their Alfonsist counterparts, will continue to honour the rights of the Basque people."

However, under Jaime del Burgo, the organization begun to take a more radical stance, and ideas of Sorel, Marinetti and other important intellectuals and political activists were circulated alongside more traditional Carlist literature. The local branch of AET began to publish their own newspaper La Esperanza, which, influenced by Marinetti’s futurism and partially drawing from the ideas of the manifesto  Carta a un compañero de la Joven España written by Ernesto Giménez Caballero, called for a newly rejuvenated Carlism, one free of the dusty and weak legalist approach of the clique led by Count of Rodezno.\n\n Pamplona’s young Carlists under del Burgo seek a truly massive clean-up of the society, one that sweeps away the old politics of turnismo once and for all, pushes the old guard of Carlism out of their self-erected pedestals, crushes the insolent syndicalists and finally, finishes the dynastic struggle once and for all. This new Carlist fighter is not some petty noble, but a true worker-peasant hero, a man of action, following a cult of motion and regenerating change. Carlism has stagnated too long, and now must come the age of young patriots, fighters for a new dawn. Old power structures will be dismantled, through enacting ideas long thought incompatible with Carlism, such as the republican agrarian reform.\n\n This new brotherhood of revolutionary Carlists will focus on the central strength of Carlism, its ability to evoke a sense of brotherhood and solidarity that crosses traditional power structures. To achieve this new order in Iberia, the electoral means of old must be discarded wholesale, and instead only struggle of military nature can solve the ailing nature of the Spaniard. Navarre, the most pious and persevering region in Spain, shall now undergo this transformation, and from it, a new form of Carlism, the Carlism of a new century, will rise like a phoenix."

BAS.126.t:0 "Holiest of Empires"
BAS.126.d:0 "As the young Carlist movement toils for a better Navarre, and better Spain under king Carlos Pio, Jaime del Burgo’s justification for crowning the king has caused a curious revivalism among Spain’s Carlist monarchists. The idea of a Holy Roman empire was always somewhat distant to the Spanish monarchists, with many focusing far more on Hispanism and the glorious imperial past rather than a short period when Austrian royal owned half of Europe and Spain was a mere secondary throne in a much larger game. Outside of a few fringe nationalists such as José Pemartín Sanjuán, Holy Roman Empire was a Central European affair, and while Catholic, was too dominated by Germans and Austrians to entice many Spaniards. However, as del Burgo has leaned more and more to the history of the Spanish king and Holy Roman Emperor Carlos V with his claim that the emperor founded a new dynasty here in Iberia after inheriting the Spanish crown, many Carlists have started to dream of greater ambitions.\n\n Iberia alone is not enough for many, as they view that the Navarrans and Basques, the most pious peoples in Europe, are inherently best suited to retake the mantle of the long dead empire. After all, the Holy Roman Empire was a bastion of Catholicism, and as the Carlist banner continues to fight the good fight against atheists and heathens alike, the most ardent Traditionalists are calling for us to topple the Protestant behemoth of Germany and rekindle true Catholicism in Europe through the mighty Carlist cannons. Others view this as a little more than imperialist warmongering, claiming that Spain had no place in the Holy Roman Empire centuries past and has even less now."

Spanish Carlists have previously mostly ignored these claims and focused on Iberian matters, though some, like Jaime de Bourbon of the Alfonsist branch and Jaime III did claim the throne of France but their support was fairly limited even among hardline French monarchists.\n\n  The French have typically supported Orleanists or in fringe cases, the Bonapartists, and only a small part of the French monarchist forces supports any form of Legitimist candidacy. However, with the strong following and resurgent, radical force supporting him, Cayetano could take the title for himself and claim that he alone is the true king of France. Seeing as we have bested the Alfonsists already, this claim could be of some use to us, though it is hardly surprising that actual support from the French would be nonexistent. Some cautious members of the king’s council see this as a mere waste of international goodwill, driving us into a potential conflict with the French, but others see it as an opportunity to quell the Communard menace once and for all and introduce pure, Catholic rule to France once more, under pious and just leadership of the Carlists."

BAS.128.t:0 "The Traditionalist Cultural Bloom"
BAS.128.d:0 "The Navarran branch of Agrupacion Escolar Tradicionalista has long been involved in the cultural scene of Navarra and especially the city of Pamplona. The members of local Carlist circle wrote, directed and acted in various theatrical pieces, usually depicting legendary battles from the various Carlist wars and uprisings of the last century. The three most famous plays by the group were Lealtad, Cruzadas and Al Borce de la Traición, the first two being something of references to the group behind much of AET’s initial support, coming from the Carlist group ‘Circle of Loyalty’ consisting of most hardliner traditionalists, usually supporting the candidacy of the Habsburg pretender Carlos Pio.\n\n These theatre performances were both a means to amass funds and propagandize the Carlist cause, with many plays tying the history of Navarra to the cause of the legitimist king. In addition to these regionalist plays, the aetists of Pamplona also took part in the festivities of San Fermin, perhaps most spectacularly with their sword-dancing group. Spathe-danza, sword-dancing, is a Basque tradition dating back centuries, and is one of the core aspects of local celebrations, so the Carlist group performing this regional tradition has become something of a strong connecting point between Basque nationalists and Carlists. The AET group, Muthiko Alaiak, has attracted Carlists from all over Euskal Herria, and this focus on the local culture has made the Carlist takeover far less dramatic than many expected.\n\n Despite the difference in politics and some societal aspects between the coastal Basque regions and Navarra, the two regions are nonetheless linked in cultural traditions, and the Pamplona Carlists’ have shown a degree of respect for these aspects of millenia old continuity that has made many Basque nationalists begrudgingly accept their rule as better than what the Madrid regime was aiming to do.\n\n Recently, this cultural bloom has been reinforced even further as a close friend of Jaime del Burgo, Jaime Lasuén, a French film director of Basque origin and Carlist ideology, has begun translating del Burgo’s theatrical works into the big screen. Lasuén, a friend of the French reactionary Pierre Benoit, has previously worked with various French exiles in the film industry, resulting in the creation of the Carlist film Por Don Carlos based on Benoit’s book. While not a massive hit in Spain and obviously banned in France because of its new revolutionary government, it solidified the career of the French woman director Musidora and inspired many a young Carlist in Iberia. Lasuén has chosen to pursue del Burgo’s play Lealtad as the first film out of AET’s old arsenal of theatre works, though the cast and release date are as of now unknown. It is hoped that it would further help spread the Carlist cause and entice younger cinephiles to enlist in their local Carlist circles, and hopefully help promote the cause of the good king overseas as well."

BAS.129.t:0 "The Pelayos"
BAS.129.d:0 "Carlists have traditionally not have an organization aimed at introducing children to the legitimist cause, but given the recent cultural synthesis of Navarra and Euskal Herria, more and more Carlists have been introduced to the ideas of the ikastola, and this has created a desire to have a similar children organization to better integrate the nation’s future into the traditionalist cause. This has become increasingly important given the youthful nature of CCP’s new leadership, consisting mostly of men under the age of 35. As such, the organization Pelayos, named after the Christian martyr Pelagius, was born, although similar initiatives had existed even before in the 1930s by the same name.\n\n Pelayos are mostly aimed at teaching children important life skills such as discipline, honour, love for God and the old laws, and most importantly, utmost loyalty to the true king of Spain. The Pelayos use an uniform very similar to the one used by Carlist militias, the Erreketes, and they often carry miniature weapons while marching in parades and similar events, even going as far as to wear the iconic red beret of Carlists. It is hoped that a Pelayo, taught in the ways of Carlism from a young age, will go on to be a strong soldier for the true king’s army in the future as well. To further propagandize the creation of such an organization, the magazine Pelayo has opened in Donostia, bringing exciting cartoons to the nation’s patriotic children, exalting the life of a Carlist Errekete, showing images of Spain’s glorious past and teaching would-be Pelayos of all the interesting and adventurous things they can experience if they join the organization.\n\nThe magazine is led by a local clergyman Mariano Vilaseca as the editor and Mosén Rosell as the chief administrator, and it has gained quite a bit of following among Catalan artists, who frequently contribute texts and cartoons to it. However, as of now the newspaper has had to rent from local private businesses, and they have applied for the new regime to subsidize its development by allocating funds for the purchase of a new workshop and printing press. However, the Pamplona government could simply give the Nerekán printing press, taken over from Basque nationalists, for the use of the magazine, in exchange for more control from the government in the substance of the paper."

BAS.130.d:0 "With the Kingdom of Navarra restored under the iron-grip of radical Carlists, their leader Jaime del Burgo has seen his duties grow exponentially from leading the local youth wing to administering an entire nation. This has, understandably, taken a toll on the young leader, who now has to balance the interests of his radicals with those of the remaining Carlist old guard and the citizens of not only Navarra but also the other provinces that make up the larger Basque territory. With his expanded duties, del Burgo rarely gets to engage with his passion for literature and history, but recently he has been able to finish his latest book, El Valle Perdido. The book is a fictitious tale of two Basque nationalists, who, flying one of the rare aircraft in Euskadi’s air service, get lost over the Pyrenean mountains and are shot down by Spanish ground fire. \n\nThe pair makes a forced landing in a secluded valley, where they find themselves transported back in time to the 19th century Navarra, ruled by local Carlists, paragons of traditionalism. The novel details their experiences in the valley and how the two Basques learn to drop their nationalist tendencies upon paying witness to the true God-fearing ways of the legitimist monarchists. Local Carlists have praised the book as an excellent work of historical fiction, especially the attention detail and historical accuracy in regards to the Carlists of the valley earning much acclaim. Basque republicans on the other hand have mocked it as a weak attempt to woo support from Euskadi’s loyalists, but their opinions mean little to del Burgo. Unconfirmed rumours seem to indicate that he is already hard at work on his second book, Huracán, though given his busy schedule it is unlikely to come out any time soon."

BAS.131.d:0 "The establishment of Navarran Guides has been a great success, and many Basque nationalists have served the cause of the Carlists admirably, fighting the Spanish menace tooth and nail. However, some have suggested that the ranks of these units are expanded to include captured socialist, syndicalist and anarchist militants as well. This suggestion may seem preposterous at first glance, but Basque socialists and Carlists have perhaps the most bizarre relation out of all Iberia. The Carlists and their left-wing counterparts have obviously clashed many a time during the years, but there have been moments of genuine cooperation during strikes, with the Basque Carlist unions supporting their nationalist and socialist counterparts in Bilbao and Eibar out of solidarity.\n\n Del Burgo is no stranger to this odd closeness between ideological extremes, since many of his friends, such as Jesús Monzón and Juan Arrastia, were communists or socialists due to the close-knit and often very insular nature of Navarran middle- and upper-class life. He is known to have recruited socialists to his own company in the past to avoid them getting executed, but given the increased visibility on the issue, del Burgo fears that allowing these left-wing radicals to be added to the Guias brigades will lead to many of the military leaders del Burgo relies for support to leave the movement. However, given that many Carlist youths have connections to these socialists and are supporting their integration to the regime out of familiar relations.\n\n More cautious members of CCP however claim that allowing these socialists to roam free among the military will make lower-ranked Carlists more susceptible to their agitation, given the increased emphasis on constant societal change and radicalization that del Burgo’s branch of Carlism espouses."

BAS.132.t:0 "Question of Margaritas"
BAS.132.d:0 "The Carlist stance on women’s organization towards the traditionalist aims has always been mixed. Given the inherent social conservatism of a movement of this type, the Carlists have not accepted women into their ranks as political actors easily, and only after the republic established vote for women in its expansions of suffrage did the Carlists start to remove these previous limitations. Traditionally, Carlist women have been seen as homemakers, their job being the raising of the next Carlist generation, and while there have been organizations aimed at mobilizing the Carlist women for various societal functions, such as the Margaritas named after Carlos VII’s wife Margaret de Bourbon-Parma, these movements have been relatively slow to gain traction, hampered by the disinterest by wider Carlist Communion and the lull in Carlist power during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship.\n\n However, Margaritas experienced something of a revival in the 1930s, especially here in Navarra, where the influence of Carlist woman organizations was far larger than in rest of Spain. Dolores Baleztena, Ascensión Cano and most importantly María Rosa Urraca Pastor spearheaded the influence of Margaritas in Northern Spain, spurred on by endorsement from Manuel Fal Conde, and under Urraca’s influence, the Margaritas would become a force of social justice and vanguard of Carlist workers’ rights. Some even claimed that Urraca was a socialist because of her fiery demands for reforms, but the reality of the matter is that the Margarita was driven to her expanded radicalism due to the fall of Spanish monarchy, a crisis that changed her political trajectory towards Carlism.\n\n She envisions a new form of Margaritas, no longer chained to home and hearth but actively taking part in the upcoming battles against the Madridian government, healing wounded, carrying mail, giving the martyred sons of Carlos their final rites and even filling in for the agricultural work while men are at the front. This would also include more women in actual Carlist politics, filling in for administrative roles and possibly even becoming leaders. Some Carlist old coots consider such ideas dangerously radical, borderline revolutionary, and completely unfitting to the traditionalist ideology, and despite the social radicalism and egalitarianism of del Burgo’s young guard, some are still leaning more towards the traditional role of women in Carlist organization. However, it is clear that the mobilization of women could be a great boon to the Navarran Carlists, and especially under Urraca’s unyielding social crusade they are quite close to del Burgo’s innovators, but the decision of whether to encourage the expansion of Margaritas’ duties is not an easy one as it will determine which side of Carlist organization will align with del Burgo and who it will turn away from his new movement."

BAS.133.d:0 "With Spain reclaimed and true Carlist order established under the legitimist king and his most loyal right-hand man, Jaime del Burgo, the question has been raised on what to do with the Alfonsine monarchists. The most hardliners within the military have retreated to the woodlands and mountains to wage a guerilla war against our regime, but such zealots are few and far between. Most Alfonsists are ready to begrudgingly bend the knee to our rule, as they prefer a Carlist regime over Republican devils or syndicalist scum in every scenario. This would also include reintegrating the Carlist old guard into our fold, given that many of them decided to support Alfonsists over our tiny state in Northern Iberia.\n\n Del Burgo, after holding numerous negotiations with his inner circle and especially after consulting his mentor Manuel Fal Conde, has been somewhat open to reintegration, but many presume that such a massive undertaking would dilute the social radicalism and revolutionary nature of the Pamplonan Carlist minority. Many fear that if a massive new Traditionalist Communion is created and the Alfonsists brought on board, all the advances the Burgoist era has brought to Carlism will be swept away under the tide of increased conservatism and return to stagnant senior Carlist politics. However, given how long del Burgo’s stewardship of the Carlist cause has been, and how much the aetistas have had to sacrifice to get here, many view that the tired, beaten and battered youths of the movement have given enough to the cause and now it is time for the less militant civilian members of the Communion to rule once more."

However, as more and more goods made in our country locally are shipped off into the world, and the industrial boom of Euskadi is in full swing, their locomotives work day and night to keep up with the demand.\n\n Many Basque citizens are also happy with the company’s growing focus on passenger transport, as their railway network expands to fit the demands of industry and agriculture, these new connections can also be used to ferry civilians between cities and towns.

BAS.153.d:0 "The merging of anarchism with nationalism may sound completely counter-intuitive at first, but to Felix Likiniano and his life-long friend Federico Krutwig, it is an essential step in achieving a form of anarchism suitable for the Basque situation. The Basques are, after their victory against Spain, absolutely fervent in their need for sovereignty, and this has traditionally been best embodied by the Euskadi national project of Sabino Arana and many nationalists after him. However, Likiniano doesn’t wish to abolish the core tenet of anarchism, that being the creation of stateless or near-stateless society, but instead to mould the idea of Basque nationalism to better fit this new reality in Euskal Herria. This new concept of anarcho-abertzalism would still see the survival of the Basque people, their customs and ideals as a very valuable thing worth fighting for, but the idea of tying these values to something like race or nationality would be superceded with culture and language. The Spaniards of Euskal Herria could be included better in this transformation period if the hypernationalist and racist tendencies of Arana were discarded, though Basque language is still planned to be the preferred language in the new territory. This new approach would see the Basque identity changing little, but the realities of the society and economy of the land would be changed to go along with the ideas of wider anarchist currents. However, there is still the question whether to espouse this idea as a new way to view anarchism globally, adopting it in the ideological conversations of Basque anarchists, or whether to simply keep the big-tent anarchism as the main ideology of the territory. The former option would likely cause us to receive the ire of our anarchist comrades internationally, but it would avoid confusion about the peculiarities of Euskal Herria should we receive visitors from the Internationale."

While we are certainly more willing to take action to secure the independence of Euskadi than the soft liberals of EAE or the moderates of EAJ, Aberri has honoured its democratic mandate and elections will run their normal course. However, given that our political platform has gone through a crash course of reforms and corrections, the party leadership has questioned lehendakari Arana on how this new course should be reflected in the next elections. \n\n Of course, we could retain our Christian democrat program, but there are other options as well. One posed by the more moderate wing of our movement is the adoption of the so-called National Democratic model, very popular in Poland and Czechia. Now that we have proven our dedication to democracy, we could use this ideological model to create even greater unity among the Basques and foster the golden era of Basque identity. However, the other option is a form of conservatism often seen in nations like ours, that have recently gained independence. This National Conservatism focuses heavily on the creation of a highly homogenous and unitary state, unified by ethnicity and piety.

The Basque National Action has grown into a true mass movement, and the Popular Front strategy has paid off immensely. But now that our movement has shifted away from small-circle theorists into proper action, a new question has risen. Where do we go from here? So far the middle class nature of our leadership has made the movement more liberal than socialist in many ways, but going forward, we may have to distance further from the centre to forge an identity of our own. \n\n The Basque society is very conservative in nature, but perhaps our movement is just what is needed to break the Basques from their outdated stupor and finally bring Euskadi to the 20th century. The Radical Progressivist ideas could provide a framework for us to work with in achieving this goal. \n\n Other option would be to bring socialist rhetoric to the toiling masses of Basque farmers, who have up until recently primarily supported Aberri, Carlists or the Basque Nationalist Party. By adopting more agrarian policies and a populist approach, we could possibly turn this large population to our side, although it would likely also greatly affect the direction of our reforms."

BAS.156.d:0 "Few expected us to win in the elections, and even fewer expected us to remain faithful to the values of Basque democracy. However, despite our radical stances, we have done so, and now hold considerable sway over the politics of Euskadi. This has, however, meant that as our union becomes more like a political party, the ideological basis becomes increasingly more muddled. There are those within our ranks who say we have betrayed the basis of the union. While such naysayers are merely a minority, they are a vocal one, especially considering the union leader Manu Robles-Arangiz is part of this group,   and they are increasingly growing into a nuisance. As such, the union-party leadership has proposed that we outline our policies in preparation for the next elections, and adopt some elements of socialist model within the democratic framework, without completely abandoning our ties to Catholic unions. \n\n We could simply continue under the Paternal Socialist model, which is possibly the most right-wing socialist model around. Many would argue that it’s barely even socialism at all, but if we add a slight red tint to our rhetoric and policies, it might just be the compromise needed to adapt the Spaniards and Basques to the new rule. \n\n However, another option is up for consideration. French syndicalists, disgusted by the violent and revolutionary rhetoric of their comrades, created the ideology of yellow syndicalism under Pierre Biétry, which aims to achieve the goals of workers through cooperation and negotiations by the organized labourers and the owner classes, similar to corporatism but with a far larger focus on the labour side itself. This would probably be the most stable decision to follow, as the ideology is clearly socialist in nature as the Communards allow it to operate, while also being moderate enough for the conditions of Basque country.”

So great were their skills that even the great nations of the world looked up to Basques to learn to hunt the behemoths of the sea. In fact, so great was our need to pursue the prey that many historians, for example the Belgian scientist Pierre-Joseph van Beneden has claimed in the last century that Basques could have found America while chasing whales, reaching the shores of Newfoundland as early as the year 1372. Two centuries later, however, the Basque whaling in that area lead to our whalers completely dominating its whaling trade, as Basques set up dozens of whaling stations there and named the territory Grandbaya. The amount of goods that could be extracted from these glorious beasts of the sea, ranging from the ever-increasingly profitable whale oil to the bones and fat of the creatures.\n\n Whales became the cornucopia of Basque colonialism, and while other nations focused on gaining land and assimilating natives to steal their riches, Basques instead simply set up trading camps and whaling stations to continue the great hunts. However, our presence in Newfoundland was important to the region, as the local natives developed a pidgin, a simplified language incorporating elements from local language and that of the foreigners to ease communication when neither side knew enough for dialogue in just one language. The Algonquian–Basque pidgin, or Souriquois, became an important means for communication between Basques and the three native tribes they met relatively often, the Montagnais, Algonquians and Iroquois.\n\n Now, the region has long been lost, as our hunters became too good for their own good and the whales grew rare, leading to the abandonment of the colonies. The British, seeing free real estate to set up their colonies, stole this land and have left it mostly idle.

Many simply wished to improve their economic prospects or sought adventures, but to others, especially in the 19th century, immigration was the only option. Many Basques who had supported the Carlist cause in the many Carlist conflicts of that century sought the newly independent nations of South America as refuge from the fury of the Spanish royal family. This lead to the development of large Basque minorities especially in nations like Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, and especially in Chile, the Basques evolved to become a rather impressive minority among Chilean elites. Many important statesmen of Chile’s history. Chile’s presidents Federico Errázuriz Zañartu and José Manuel Balmaceda, as well as great military leaders such as Bernardo O'Higgins, who freed Chile from Spain, and Manuel Baquedano, who fought for Chile in the War of the Pacific, all came from Basque roots. Even within the new socialist government, the rising star Salvador Allende of the more moderate Chilean socialists can track his lineage right back to Euskal Herria. As such, this ancestral bond has made many Chileans travel here to free Euskadi, for some to reunite with old families and for others to simply see the homeland once more.

BAS.232.d:0 "The Spanish army has fallen, their cities have been occupied by the combined might of Basques, Catalans and Galicians, and in the wretched heart of Castile, Madrid, the architects of Spain’s downfall have been cast from their lairs. The military junta that destroyed the Second Spanish Republic and tried to rule Spain through civilian proxies and a hated monarch has been made to answer for their crimes, and figures like Jose Sarjurjo, Francisco Franco and Emilio Mola will face the people’s justice. However, the question now remains whether the Basques and their new allies are to proclaim the spiritual successor to the ideas of Spain’s two republican projects, though now under a far more federal structure, or if the minority peoples of Iberia are better off with a confederation of their own. The Iberian federation would see equal citizenship given to them, but the dominant position of Castilians at the helm of the federation would be no more, and the Catalans, Basques, Galicians, Andalusians and Asturians, alongside myriad of other smaller groups, would see their position greatly improve. Spain would be sectioned into autonomous regions, ensuring that local governance is handled by the minority groups themselves, with equal representation in the new federal parliament established through national-level autonomous territory representatives voted in at regional level. However, many see that this style of federation would still see the Castilians worm their way into hegemony in the internal affairs given their large numbers, and they feel that a shackled rump state of Castile encircled by a federation made up of Galicians, Catalans and Basques would be a better solution. This would see the areas of Asturias and Leon attached to the union, as well as Cantabria, La Rioja and Aragon. Castile, La Mancha, Extremadura, Murcia and Andalusia would remain in the hands of the Spaniards, and heavy reparations would be placed upon their new republic to ensure that the Spaniards do not ever rise to oppress the peoples of Iberia. This new confederation would be named after the Galeusca Pact formed during the Primo de Rivera era between the various nationalist groups of Iberia."

BAS.234.d:0 "Felix Likiniano may be the face of Euskal Herria’s anarchist movement, and his contributions are obviously notable, but the man leading the anarchists today would not be here if not for his family. Coming from a family of Gizupkoan workers, he had three sisters and two brothers, Jose Antonio and Eduardo both of whom were important to the rise of anarchism in Euskal Herria. His brother, Jose Antonio, fought for the first time against the reactionaries during the Asturias rising, alongside his brothers.\n\n While Felix would be captured and sentenced to prison for fifteen years, his brothers managed to escape persecution, and would start what would develop into the anarchist movement of the Basques in later years. Following the chaos in Spain before the 1936 elections, Felix managed to escape the prison and joined his brothers in preparation of Iberian insurrection. When no such revolution happened, Felix and his brothers would cooperate with the nationalists of Jose Antonio Aguirre, Luis Arana, Santiago Aznar and Elias Gallastegi in preparation of the Basque rising, and alongside his brothers, he raided the Guardia Civil barracks in Donostia.\n\n Using his knowledge of the place thanks to his service there in the beginning of 1930s, the brothers and the members of their Dynamite group managed to seize numerous heavy and light weapons for the Basque cause, and it earned Likiniano much prestige and support from the Basque government, despite ideological differences. Jose Antonio would later perish in the battle of Albertia, at the young age of 19, fighting the Spanish invaders to the bitter end. Eduardo would instead go to infiltrate the Carlists, providing the Basque government with important information about their true loyalties, and his support would help dismantle the Carlist rebellion later after the fall of the republic. The family’s contributions to the cause of Basque anarchism cannot be understated, and the sacrifice of young Jose Antonio will forever be an example to the idealistic young Basques following the cause of anarcho-abertzalism."

BAS.235.t:0 "The Unified Euskara"
BAS.235.d:0 "The Basque academic world was shaken up today as the Jakintza Baitha group was created by the rising star of Basque linguistics, Federico Krutwig. The young erudite has gathered likeminded reformers of the Euskara language into his new ‘House of Knowledge’. Starting off originally as a club of Hellenophiles interested in the classical languages of the Mediterranean, it has now expanded into a truly reformist society based on the ideas of Krutwig. Krutwig and Jakintza Baitha in his support have proposed Labourdine dialect of the Basque as the cornerstone of further efforts at standardizing Basque language, contrary to the more commonly accepted Gizupkoan or Biskaian dialects.\n\n According to Krutwig, the Labourdine dialect is better for the process as this dialect is most often written instead of spoken due to various societal oddities of the region. Thus, the standardization process would likely become far easier when using a form of the Euskaran that has already undergone several centuries of evolution in written form. Krutwig’s controversies with the Euskaltzaindia do not stop there, however, as the man is also notable for vehement dismissal of language purism when it comes to Euskara, claiming that purism and avoidance of loanwords will only lead the language to be a children’s tongue and nothing more. To him, purism is a corset strangling the language development of Euskara and keeping it from reaching a civilized, modern form.\n\n In addition to his support of the Labourdine dialect, Krutwig has also suggested the complete dropping of other dialects from literary use, claiming that dialecticism will simply continue to fracture the already fragile language. His comments about the ‘vulgarity’ of Basque culture, its reliance on backwards peasants and their popular, simple-minded traditions, has also caused quite the uproar in the territory, with many saying that he is nothing more than a elitist, aristocratic snob masquerading as an anarchist. The nominal leadership of Likiniano has been called to answer this behaviour, with some within the anarchist leadership demanding the man to be reprimanded while others praise his modernist gadfly outlook into the stagnant Basque language politics."

BAS.236.d:0 "The region of Euskal Herria is, outside of its main cities like Bilbao, Donostia and Pamplona, remained relatively unchanged throughout the centuries. When Basques first arrived to the shores of Biskaia millenia ago, they did not come as hunters and gatherers but as farmers, and as their roots grew deep into the soil of Gizupkoa, Biskaia and Iparralde, they took to the seas to extract the bounties of Biskaian coast, Atlantic shorelines and beyond. Our people have endured these regions for millenia, and the soil itself is nurtured by the sweat of Basque brow longer than any other region of Spain could claim.\n\n But ever since the arrival of maketos to our lands, they have attempted to impose their own order, laws and techniques on the Basque people, forcing them to adopt inefficient Spanish farming techniques and fishing practices. They have levied taxes on the labour of our workers and farmers, and claimed ownership over the very land our ancestors plowed for so long. Yet no longer is this the case. The Spanish nobles, clergymen and bourgeoisie will no longer determine the wages, hours or ownership of Basque lands and labour, for those that still remain of these exploiter classes will face swift justice at the gallows or on the very fields they attempted to hold lordship over.\n\n The ancient professions of the Basques will be returned to the hands of those who toil the fields and brave the seas, and while this will happen in a far more communalized and collectivized manner than before, the people who actually produce the goods will now have full access to the fruits of their labour, instead of it going to corrupt church officials, administrative middlemen or soft-handed nobles. This has obviously caused worry in those Basques who own property of their own, but for the most part, due to the nature of the land here in Euskal Herria, they will largely retain the ownership of their lands as long as the excess crops are put into the good of the society, not to fatten the purses of the farmers. Same applies to the fishermen and sailors of Donostia and Lekeitio, who will gain their fair share of the bounty and share rest of it with their communities. No longer will one man lord over one another due to the difference in their fortunes, but the territory of Euskal Herria shall instead become a bastion of worker’s solidarity and societal justice."

Enemies circled around CNT-FAI like jackals looking for an easy meal, and the revolutionary fervour of the French Communards washed over Spain like a flood. The noble fighters of FAI smashed apart yellow unionists, police thugs, right-wing paramilitaries and republican collaborators alike, confident that the events of France would happen here too. The red and black tide reached even the distant shores of Biscay, usually sheltered from such ideological developments by the sheer reactionary nature of Basque society.\n\n A group of radical anarchists led by Buenaventura Durruti founded the Los Justicieros group in the coastal city of San Sebastian, with the eventual goal of assassinating king Alfonso XIII. While CNT-FAI had spread into Basque country somewhat even before the founding of Los Justicieros, the actions of that group helped cement the arrival of anarchism to this wayward territory, alongside some Basque agitators seeping in from over the French border. Given their importance to the anarchist movement in our small territory and the lack of real ideological direction that Basque anarchists have, the local council has decided to create a memorial to the actions of Los Justicieros. While they may have been a small footnote in the history of Iberian anarchism, to us they were the spark that started a true fire."

However, after the fall of Bilbao and the capitalist republic propped up there, Donostia was also taken over by the anarchist masses, and while Bilbao remains the central hub of governance, Donostia  has quickly evolved into the heart of the anarchist revolution. Workers in the typical monos attire are joined by the roughly dressed seamen and dock-workers in the streets of the crimson city, offices and shops are converted into working places or public houses and the many casinos of the city, famous as hubs of international intrigue during the Weltkrieg, have been socialized to instead serve a societal function. Some are turned into giant warehouses, others are used as educational facilities and others are simply turned into housing.\n\n The city’s ancient walls are once again converted to defensive purposes, as members of the confederal militias stream into the walls during training and guard duties. The city, which during the Carlist wars had stood as the sole liberal settlement in Basque country, now serves as the headquarters for the transformation of entire Basque country into modern, decentralized and thoroughly communalist territory free of capitalist oppressors, reactionary religious fundamentalist and Spanish colonialists. The cultural capital of Basque country shall serve as a beacon of true revolution in Iberia, though under the dominance of Basques and Basques alone as the ideas of Felix Likiniano and his abertzale supporters demand. Basque language and culture studies have been organized city-wide to bolster the rise of Basque ethnic conciousness, and these have been especially aimed at bridging the gap between Spaniards and Basques. The new initiatives are not aimed at eradicating Spanish in Euskal Herria, but instead create a sense of bilingual pride among the anarchists of the territory, as Basques will no longer suffer the boot of Spanish dominance.\n\n Internationale artists, musicians and journalists have observed the transformation of Donostia wide-eyed, seeing Basque anarchism bloom from its meagre roots into a spectacular kaleidoscopic flower, showing the different colours of Basque culture in a display of ethnic pride, Catholic faith and fervour to see a truly stateless society as the Basque ancestors themselves followed. Many observers from Commune of France and Union of Britain have been quite wary of the transformation, but open denouncement of the Basque ideals have thus far not been a common occurrence in Internationale press, save for some of the most hardliner anarchists of France.\n\n Yet for the most part, many Internationale media personnel have thoroughly enjoyed the fruits of Basque art, as well as the products and eccentric traditions of the txoko cuisine clubs. Basque sports such as pelota have also seen some degree of resurgence as famous athletes from the Internationale visit our territory and mingle with the famed football stars of Bilbao and Donostia. Some within Bilbao watch the rise of Donostia with jealousy, but for the most part, this cultural boom has taken the small territory by storm and increased the popularity of the anarchist unions and councils."

BAS.239.d:0 "Euskalduna, one of the pearls of Basque industry, was first created by Sir Ramon de la Sota, one of the most celebrated Basque nationalists alongside Sabino Arana, one of the few Spaniards to be elevated to knighthood of the British Empire by George V and also the man behind EAJ’s adoption of more pragmatic positions in Spanish politics. While his list of credentials may be long, most importantly for our anarchist cause, he founded the large shipyard Euskalduna and employed many of our dockworker supporters as well. After he passed in 1936, heartbroken to see his shipyards dwindle in orders due to the terrible global economic situation, the company has been somewhat derelict with the chaos in Spain causing issues with its leadership. The plutocrats running the company ran the second our revolution came, as can be expected of the exploiter class, but the shipyards themselves still exist in all their glory. We must reopen them to business, churning out civilian and military ships to further the goal of a global revolution. With Euskalduna giving us destroyers, corvettes and torpedo boats to work with, we could seek to raid the capitalist shipping passing by our shores as well. The gifts of these shipyards will be great, and they are only expected to increase now that the people creating the goods are also in charge of the production. The Euskalduna co-operative manned by anarcho-syndicalists of IFA-LKN and the socialist abertzale experts from Alfa Group have made sure that the new worker ownership of the shipyards goes smoothly, forging yet another bond between the abertzales of different colours. The governing council of the Euskalduna shipyards has already received some orders from minor syndicalist nations worldwide, who do not possess the means to build ships themselves yet are looking to build a navy and merchant fleet. Similar massive transformation has been observed in the largest company of Iberia, Altos Hornos de Vizcaya, a metallurgical and mining company employing most of Biskaia’s workers. The entire company and its subsections have been consolidated into smaller units run by local councils, working in unison through a union-led framework. The company’s owners, known for harshly repressing labour unrest in the past, especially in the 1917 and 1931 strikes, unfortunately managed to avoid working man’s justice. The transition period with AHV has not been easy, however, as various subsections are controlled by different unions, such as IFA-LKN, Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna and Langileen Batasun Orokorra, leading to bickering and ideological differences in organization, though the governing council of Felix Likiniano has worked with the leaders of these unions, notably Santiago Aznar, to smooth out differences between the unions."

BAS.240.d:0 "Euskadi has seen a sharp rise in unionism after the declaration of the Basque republic, but for the most part, the Solidarity for Basque Worker, ELA, union has stolen most of the spotlight. Given the ban on Spanish parties and unions, many workers flocked to the banner of ELA, and while this did turn the union more towards socialism than it had ever been before, it was still mainly a Christian union and exhibited dangerous corporatist principles. However, now that the Basque anarchists decapitated the snake of reaction and crushed the traditionalist attempt at plunging Euskadi back into the dark ages, elements of left-leaning ELA have approached us in hopes of helping the revolutionary cause. While the differences between our coastal syndicalists and their mainly urban, Catholic workers are great and will keep our movements apart, there is no reason to not seek a closer alliance. The alliance with ELA will make it easier to not upset the Catholic workers quite as much, while it also allows our anarchists to influence them more towards true socialist thinking, free of corporatist bootlicking of the ownership class. The alliance will likely prove to be a complex and cumbersome one, but many of our existing allies, such as Santiago Aznar of the EAS-LBO, view this coalition as a good alternative to simply ruling alone and shouldering the ire of the Catholic population. Alliance between the mainline CNT-FAI and a Christian union would have been impossible back when Euskal Herria was still a part of Spain, but given the patriotic populism of Felix Likiniano and other members of his “Dynamite” group, such as Frederick Krutwig, the differences between ELA and IFA-LKN have been able to be reconciled with, at least to some degree. The more anarchist-minded members of Likiniano’s group do see ELA as a remaining bastion of reaction, but the leadership has been quick to point out that even France, the vanguard of revolution, allows Christian unions to operate unimpeded."

BAS.241.t:0 "Anarchism in the Confines of Basque Piety"
BAS.241.d:0 "One of the most defining features of Spanish anarchism is the fervent and unyielding anti-clericalism of its supporters. Given how intertwined the church has always been with Spanish politics, and how Catholic clergy has been a major influence to reactionary movements such as Renovacion Espanola, Carlists and Accion Popular, it’s not surprising how the anarcho-syndicalists of CNT-FAI have developed a distaste for the church. While our nascent movement has mainly adhered by the guidelines of the wider union, with matters of faith the leadership of our movement remains divided. Some of the more fervent revolutionaries want to completely eradicate the church control over here in Basque country, but most followers of anarchism here are either indifferent or against such measures. While our supporters may follow the tenets of anarchism usually, here in the heartland of Euskadi even the anarchist remains a rather pious man.\n\n As such, even if it means deviating from rest of Spain, something that Felix Likiniano is not particularly opposed to given his nationalist tendencies, we must make sure that the church is not threatened from performing their religious duties. At least here in Basque country, the clergymen are members of the society mingling with the common men, not some paternalistic figures holding masses and berating their followers without interacting with them otherwise. Of course, action must be taken in case the priests and other functionaries of the faith attempt to spread reactionary sentiments in Basque society, but for now we must foster good faith between our movement and the religious institutes. However, those priests and Jesuits known for supporting Spanish ideas overtly or covertly, are to be removed from the society one way or another, for free Euskadi to not fall to the devious madmen of the Catholic church seeking to spread dissident thoughts among the pious men and women of Euskal Herria ."

Dotted between these behemoths of nature’s might, small hamlets with long piers defied the harsh elements, their harbours housing many rugged ships with sturdy nets and sharp harpoons. For many of the journalists and members of both British and French intelligentsia, the thought that these small hovels and forgotten villages had burst alit the flame of revolution in Iberia was simply incomprehensible. Compared to the organized and urbanized mass revolutions of France and Britain, these unassuming houses seemed fit to only house reactionary peasants. \n\nYet as the ship finally sailed to the dockyard of San Sebastian, the representatives were greeted by waving flags of black and red, mixed in with some ikurrinas and black eagle flags. The home of Basque revolution, and the jewel of the Crimson Coast, exhibited just as much revolutionary fervour as their French and British comrades had done so many years ago, and while the Internationale representatives would very much come to learn the ins and outs of the new Basque society, their later reports to various press organs of the Internationale would always harp back to that initial dichotomy of the Basque revolution, as inspiration to movements just like theirs."

BAS.243.d:0 "While serving the revolutionary cause has been a great honour for the leader of Basque anarchist, Felix Likiniano, it has also taken a toll on his mental perseverance. After all, introducing an ideology that seems to be at odds with the very fabric of Basque being into Euskal Herria has hardly been an easy task, and Likiniano has had to reinforce the local councils and unions with various complaints and confusions of the local populace. Adding to the strain are the remaining reactionaries, be they Carlists, Aberriak or Spanish monarchists, who still continue to take swipes at revolutionary unity by raiding supply depots, remote villages and militia barracks in the dark of the night. To put his mind at ease during the few moments of peace Likiniano has, he has returned to a beloved hobby of woodworking, sharpening his mind with the precision and artistic vision needed in to create something out of ordinary blocks of wood.\n\n However, it would appear that his latest work has not been a mere pastime, as the most trusted members of his inner circle, original members of the ‘Dynamite group’ such as Kasilda Hernaez and Frederick Krutwig, were gathered one day before Likiniano in his workshop. There, he showed them his latest product, a wood carving resembling a snake wrapped around an axe, with the words Bietan Jarraitu or ‘Keep up both’ carved to the statue. Likiniano explained his latest work to be a symbol of the new Basque anarchist movement, representing the dual aims of the IFA-LKN in Basque country.\n\n The snake, a symbol of cunning, represented the need for a sharp mind and silvery tongue in uniting the stubborn or even outright hostile Basques under the banner of anarchism and abertzale beliefs, while the axe, a symbol of strength, represented the need for military prowess to ensure that the Basque revolution would never flicker out due to either domestic or international pressure. The new symbol was presented to other groups within Euskal Herria in the later weeks, and would go on to become adopted even by non-anarchist abertzales as a general symbol of the Basque struggle for sovereignty. The symbol has even been recommended to be used in conjunction with the Ikurrina, to truly show the transformation of Euskal Herria into a new form."

BAS.244.d:0 "One of the staunchest supporters of Felix Likiniano’s transformation of Euskal Herria has been his long-time partner Kasilda Hernaez. An anarchist and a long-time feminist, Hernaez has earned the nickname Miliciano for participating in guerilla fighting against the government of Spain on numerous occasions, most notably in the Asturian Revolution of 1934. Even before that she had been imprisoned for organizing and supporting a strike at a women’s factory, though Kasilda was also arrested for bathing nude on Donostia’s beaches beforehand. Her example has been immensely important in organizing the Basque women into taking part in the revolutionary restructuring of the Basque society. Many former members of Eusko Emakume Ekintza, the women’s section of Eusko Abetzale Ekintza, have been further radicalized by the example of the Miliciana, and the new Basque women’s organization has been formed to continue the struggle towards women’s emancipation, dubbed Emakume Askeak.\n\n This new organization is heavily influenced by the Mujeres Libres group within CNT-FAI, though as can be expected of Basque anarcho-abertzales, the new organization includes Basque patriotism as well. They have began organizing women’s education athenaeums, modelled after the same libertarian people’s schools that gave Hernaez much of her early education, and some women-dominated fields such as textile industry have started to create women’s co-operatives and unions specifically to self-manage those fields without the patriarchal attitudes of Basque men.\n\n While the traditionalist outlook of Basque society towards women has made the start of Emakume Askeak relatively difficult, especially given that many Basque women are immensely Catholic and conservative, Likiniano and Hernaez believe that with time, these hurdles can be overcome and truly libertarian fighters for women’s equality can blossom in Euskal Herria."

But to our leaders, Hernaez and Larrañaga, there is no alternative. As the French did after the Revolution of 1789, the Basques must adopt a Cult of Reason. Like the French, we will free Euskadi from the Catholic Church which bounds it in tradition and backwardness. As the original Jacobins did, we too shall guide humanity to Liberty and Truth, worshipping Reason above all else, so that mankind can finally leave the darkness of ignorance and step into the light of Enlightenment. The fate of our people must not be determined by some delusion of a higher being, but by our hand alone, the replacement of gods found within us all. Cult of Reason guides us into the future, where the common man has all the tools for improvement right inside his own head. Just as the marvellous and timeless ideas of Marx, Lenin and Thorez lead us into a more egalitarian and just society, so does the Cult of Reason show us the path to a society where reason, intelligence and logic triumph over superstition. The ill-begotten gains of the Church that it has ripped off the hides of the working man for centuries shall be seized and repurposed to help the common people, the priests shall be re-educated to forget their delusions and the Basque people will uplifted from their kneeled prayer to stand tall as rational actors, not as servants of gods."

At the moment many within their ranks have clamoured to join our party, but as the union was originally a Catholic organization under the control of the Nationalist Party, it harbours a lot of dissidents that could seek to harm our movement if left unchecked. Our Minister of Agriculture, Vicente Uribe, has proposed integrating the union as is into our state apparatus, and then weeding out the nationalists and Christian saboteurs from within. While costly politically, it would allow us to kickstart a party-controlled union without the slow process of creating one from the ground up and recruiting members. However, some within our party, Chairman Hernaez included, support the renaming of the union after we absorb it into wider Jacobin framework. Hernaez has proposed naming it the Sindicato de Vizcaya, after his first trade union as a young communist, Sindicato Metalúrgico de Vizcaya. It would better indicate the union’s role as the single, uncontested union of the EPK. Some, however, desire that the original name is kept as a slight concession to traditions."

But just as one corner of Iberia is saved from the madness of conservatism, other parts of it sink even deeper into this disgusting rot. The Kingdom of Spain has abandoned any notion of serving its people and instead just feeds its bloated carcass of caciquismo and nobility with the fruits of the downtrodden classes’ labour. Just like the Jacobins of 1789 destroyed the behemoth of reaction, and just like the revolutionaries of the 1920s tried to topple the old order, we, Jacobins of Euskadi, will march to Madrid and burn down the old world.

The Jacobin order is absolute, and thus the revolution is mere weeks from being finalized with the conquest of Spain. However, the party line is far from clear, with the inevitable factionalism setting in. The party struggles from the presence of two factions, the majority supporting Hernaez’s more mainline Jacobin line where much of the focus is placed on the scrubbing of Basque and Iberian culture and tradition from our new order, instead placing emphasis on internationalism and Jacobin culture instead. However, nationalists such as Larranaga have argued that this will uproot our movement from the people and simply drive the people into rebellion against our rule. While Hernaez holds the majority and could easily shut Larranaga down, his minority is strong enough that it could easily make the party politics a hellscape.

Robert Iribarne, a promising Basque pilot who had been training in secret over the border in French Basque country alongside other Basque nationalists and socialists, made the perilous journey back to Basque country by a bicycle when the war was declared. Joining the few pilots our tiny nation had in an improvised air field north of Bilbao, these daredevils were given three Avia BH-33 fighters from Czechia, originally ordered for Republican Spain and then stashed to Basque country in anticipation of a possible Communard attack once the Republic was crushed.\n\n These Avias, hastily painted in Basque colours, would form the basis of the Basque air force during those terrible days of the independence war, and Iribarne proved to be our best pilot, engaging multiple Spanish aircrafts during the conflict and earning the title of ace even as his two comrades in the othe Avias were tragically lost during the battles. His eventually tally of five aerial victories would include two Spanish Hart bombers, who got lost on a bombing raid to Gernika and were pounced upon by Iribarne, a Macchi M.18 sea plane that was directing the fire of Spanish navy during their raid of Bilbao, his only fighter kill, a Letov Š-231 that had been attempting to strafe the Iron Ring of Bilbao, and finally, a Hispano-Suiza HS-34 scout plane directing an attack on those same fortifications. While Iribarne was able to emerge unscathed from the war, his plane did not, as the stress of those constant flights was too much for it after such a long storage and his fighter, nicknamed Irrintizina, was scrapped. However, as the Basque government is looking into buying Dutch Fokker DXXI’s, it is more than likely that Iribarne will be one of our first test pilots for the new, and more capable, fighter."

BAS.251.t:0 "The Slaying of Spaniards"
BAS.251.d:0 "As our academics and historians have been hard at work constructing a proper Basque chronicle on our history, so often forgotten as a mere part of Spanish historical records, a curious story has come to our attention. The Slaying of the Spaniards, as told by an Icelandic historian of the period, Jón lærði Guðmundsson, describes an event where a fleet of Basque ships crashed onto Icelandic shores in 1615, while hunting for whales. The winter of that year was particularly harsh, and the Basques spent it in the Westfjords of Iceland, coming into an agreement with the locals on the conditions of their stay. Of the eighty survivors of the shipwreck, a portion left for Basque country shortly after winter was over, but some stayed behind for various reasons. There, they came into conflict with the locals after some Basque whalers stole dried fish from a local merchant’s lodge. The Icelandic response was, as can be expected of such brutal folk, disproportionately cruel, as they killed fourteen whalers in a night raid. The bodies were mutilated and tossed into the sea, denied of honourable burial. Few days later, rest of the Basques were declared outlaws by the local council claiming to represent ‘justice’, and the Basques were brutally hunted down. Upon capture, they would be struck in the eyes, ears and noses, and even worse atrocities were committed according to the Icelandic historian. The entire event is a tragedy, and while it is many centuries old, some nationalists have called for justice to be served, given how cruel and unreasonable the Icelandic response was. While obviously a rather odd hill to die on, the nationalist fervour gripping Euskadi has made this suggestion more popular than one would assume."

BAS.252.t:0 "The Norwegian-Basque Maritime War"
BAS.252.d:0 "After the conquest of Iceland and righting of the historical wrongs towards the Basque people, the island has become an integral part of our fishing operations. Already, Basque vessels manufactured by Euskalduna are snatching bounties from their British, Norwegian and Danish rivals, and this superiority of seamanship has obviously led to a degree of controversy. Norwegian sailors, citing dubious territorial violations, claim that Basque sailors are intruding on their fishing spots. Obviously this is mostly a ploy by the less skilled fishermen to try and claim some moral high ground when faced with their lack of experience with the harsh waters of the Arctic sea.\n\n However, some Basque scholars and historians have pointed out that these Norwegian attitudes may stem from the history of Basque and Norwegian rivalry. The current disputes are very similar to the ones that drove the Basques away from their whaling stations in the 16th and 17th century, though back then the imperialists of Britain and the Netherlands were to blame. Nevertheless, once the Basques lost their monopoly in the Arctic to aggressive foreigners seeking to steal their bounty, and now the Norwegians seem to harbour similar ideas.\n\n Some Basque nationalists have even claimed that now that we are a rising power in naval matters, we should teach the Norwegians a lesson and seize the island of Svalbard where we were so rudely pushed away from centuries ago. This proposition, of course, has issues of its own, and more moderate members of the Basque parliament see it as nonsense, but with the conquest of Iceland and the settling of scores, many view these further ventures as a good way to regain our past glory as the naval merchant thalassocracy of the Arctic sea."

BAS.253.d:0 "We now control a very expansive territory in the Arctic, and have shown our old rivals that the Basque ascension cannot be impeded. Yet as these conquests continue, some have started to view Greenland as the next conquest. Basque whalers rarely went as far north as the faraway island, but some records do claim that Basques hunted whales even amidst the northern ice off the coast of Greenland. However, to many Basques, the island itself is less important than the situation of its people, who have suffered greatly at the hands of their Danish overlords.\n\n The Greenlandic Inuits have long been little more than a nuisance to the Danish, and given that Basque ships now regularly visit the harbours of this colony, the plight of their people is evident. More and more calls for the liberation of this region from the imperialists are being heard within the Basque parliament, though others are claiming that this is simply a ridiculous fabrication to justify yet another land grab. It is true that owning Greenland would allow us to expand our trade routes to the American continent easily. However, ultimately the government could justify the invasion as an anti-colonial mission, though whether the leadership of Euskadi wishes to pursue it is another matter."

As this renewed interest in Basque naval feats is being unearthed, some have pointed out that the Basques went as far as the coast of New England and what would be modern New York while chasing whales. There is little information of the Basques settling there, as records are fuzzy on matters like these and the region was relatively uncharted when the Basques first arrived, but some believe that the Basques may have very well been the first to explore the area thoroughly. With the Canadians humbled in the Newfoundland war and the American collapse well underway, some nationalist figures especially among Eusko Mendigoxale Batza and Eusko Alderdi Aberri have called for the Basques to expand our overseas holdings into New England and beyond, staking our claims on the areas our sailor ancestors charted in the days of yore.\n\n Once again, the moderates and pacifists among Basque leadership have bashed such plans as ‘imperialist warmongering’, but given the tumultuous situation in America, many within these American territories would likely see an overseas backer as a good thing. Nonetheless, such a venture is not only domestically controversial, the logistics of such an undertaking are also debated, and even the nationalists are divided on whether such an invasion would be worth our while."

There are regions, such as the territory of Iparralde or French Basque Country, that remain under the rule of the Communards, and some parts of Spain, that still house great number of Basques within their borders. However, some have supported pushing our claims further, expanding the definition of Manuel Larramendi’s original 18th century idea of an United Provinces of the Pyrenees idea. Larramendi, an early supporter of a Basque nation based on ethnic lines, wanted to unite the seven provinces populated by Basques into one entity. However, his ideas were also heavily tied to the Pyrenees mountain chain, and many Basques have begun to call for the complete ownership of these mountains by the Basque people, as we have lived here since time immemorial.\n\n Historians of the Basque cause have also noted that this would fulfill the Napoleonic era idea of Euskal Herria as a ‘New Phoenicia’, as proposed by Dominique Garat. The idea wanted to create a neutral buffer zone between Spain and France, as well as providing a new nation for the Basques. Many have expanded the borders of these hypothetical ideas to include areas such as Aragon, Catalonia and some French provinces, especially the anarchist firebrand Federico Krutwig. The new fire burning in the souls of the Basques has made it easy for these warhawks to push their expansionist agenda, even with the traditionally rather insular Basques, and many now hope that the government pursue these ideas for the glory of Euskadi, so long held in the shadow of Spain."

Yet there are ways in which the extent of this carnage could be limited, and while the workers and soldiers of our young state toil so that the liberation of Iberia from Castilian dominance may come to fruition, our diplomats are struggling with another problem. The Spanish, ruled by a junta and oppressed under the barrel of a gun, will never join us peacefully, but the Galicians and Catalans may view independence in a wholly different light now that they’ve had a proper taste of it.\n\n After all, much of the nationalist fervour that led to the great separatist revolt came from rather fringe movements within all our three nations, and only the actions of these most fierce of rebels led to the more moderate members of all these societies to be dragged abroad to secession train. If an alternative was provided in the way of an equal federation of all Iberian peoples, it is not impossible that the Catalans and Galicians would be more than willing to join our new state in union, to fight against the Spanish menace. Some, however, oppose this move, considering the liberation of Iberia to be a solely Basque affair, and one where the Basques should leave the Galicians and Catalans to their own devices unless they later wish to join our nation once Castile no longer exists."

BAS.268.d:0 "After the decision was taken by the anarchist councils of Euskal Herria to retake the theorized ancestral lands of the Basques, the man behind the theory, Federico Krutwig, has been busy. He has continued exploring his ideas of an ancestral Basque reach in Europe, and recently, he has theorized that there may have existed a larger state or society of proto-Basques reaching all the way to the borders of Western Europe and the basin of the Mediterranean. Over time, the Basques would have retreated further towards their current territories, leaving behind isolated communities like the Pictish and Guanche peoples. Krutwig calls this nation ‘Garaldea’, the ‘land of we are’ or ‘land of fire’. This theory has received even more ire from the experts of Euskaltzaindia, who claim that it is simply an imperialist invention to claim some greater history of Basques than what unfolded in reality. \n\nNonetheless, Krutwig has defended his theory fiercely, and the Basque people, caught up in an euphoria of both cultural renaissance and ethnic revanchism, have been eager to support this more glorious past of the Basques. Some have even proposed that the Basques lead a revolution that would see the reunification of Garaldea, as a symbol of European unity in a way that respects the boundaries of the numerous smaller peoples of Europe instead of the concentrated metropole-dominated nations of Europe the world sees today. This version of Garaldea would see the small stateless nations of Europe, such as the Bretons, Catalans, Roma and numerous others to have a far more autonomous role as part of a greater, highly decentralized and anarchist whole."

BAS.269.d:0 "Ever since the founding of Jakintza Baitha, the importance of Federico Krutwig to the Basque academic scene has been growing ever more. Given his importance to Basque anarchism, he has been busy with diplomatic missions to the Internationale due to his polyglot talents. However, when not conversing with Syndicalist politicians or in meetings with industrial unions, Krutwig has followed his passion of linguistic studies, especially when visiting Scotland. While there, he has taken an extreme interest in the Picts, as he believes that they may have been related to the Basques. Originally, it was thought he was merely interested in finding possible sister languages to Euskaran, but after his most recent visit to Scotland, the man has come up with a theory that has shook all of Euskal Herria.\n\n Krutwig claims that the Picts and Basques are not only related, but are infact the very same language. Collaborating with Basque and Scottish archaeologists such as Jose Migel Barandiaran Aierbe, he has mapped out similar words and inscriptions between the Basque old scripts and surviving Pictish relics, and has found even more fuel to his theory by contrasting these with whatever little remains of the Guanche language. He now claims that the original Basque language stretched from the Canaries to the Scottish highlands, shrinking into isolated cultures after some great catastrophe.\n\n Most Basque linguists have denounced this theory as mere pseudo-scientific babble, but given Krutwig’s status among the anarchists, this idea has started to gain traction. Some more nationalist members have even claimed that perhaps these territories should be united once more, disregarding the fact that there are no Picts or Guanches left, though such views are a minority as it would compromise our relations with the Internationale. However, given the bloom of Basque revanchism after centuries under Spanish bootheel, the idea of reuniting the lost lands of the Basque people has gripped the minds of many, and Likiniano himself has been called to give a final word on the matter."

The dream of a return to republican system has been fulfilled, the scars of 1932’s coup have healed, and Iberia is finally free of monarchist or militarist rot. Or it would be, but Portugal has been ruled by the ultranationalist monarchists for decades now, oppressing their people and especially those in their colonial holdings in Africa for the gain of their crowned one and his cronies. The Basques and their new Galician and Catalan allies are of course worn out and tired of the wars that have ravaged this peninsula since the collapse of the Spanish crown, but many still carry the fire of democratic republicanism and Iberian federalism within their hearts, and the recent victory against the primordial beast of Castile has only added more fuel to that fire. Thus, many fervent republicans and federalists such as Daniel Cardona i Civit of Catalonia and Telesforo Monzon from Euskadi have called for the combined Iberian armies to march to the very edge of the Iberian peninsula, toss the Portuguese monarchists into the sea and free the noble people of Lusitania from this obsolete and tyrannical form of despotism. Yet for many, Spain is enough.

These lands belonged to us once in the past, centuries ago when our ancestors chased the majestic beasts of the depths with harpoon and net. While our whaling stations are gone and little remains of the whales as well, the ancestral connection we have with the local Algonquin tribes has slowly been revived. The Basque-Algonquin pidgin that our ancestors used to communicate with these natives is largely gone now, despite the efforts of Basque linguists, but the local tribes have told stories of the Vasconians who came here to hunt the local whales. The Basques and New World natives, for the most part, shared a relatively good trade partnership, and as Basques did not seek complete domination of the region unlike the more imperialist newcomers, the relations remained strong till the very end of Basque whaling, outside of the Inuits who the Basques considered enemies for one reason or another.\n\n Now that we have returned to this ice-covered land, the question on everyone’s lips is, what will Euskadi do with it. We pried it off the hands of the Canadians and Britons, who think they can pillage it for their own good without a care for the rights of the natives. Most Basques are calling for us to release an independent state of the Mi’kmaqs, who will be able to build up their old ways of life under our supervision and protection. Some, however, note that without a permanent presence, the land will be taken over by the imperialists once more, and the natives will once more be under the perfidious white hounds.

However, while these dialects are still an important part of Euskara, the encroachment of Spanish language on Euskal Herria and the influence of Spanish immigrants has slowly made some dialects fall in use. One of the most dire cases is with the dialect of Roncal, or Erronkariera, as it is known in Euskaran. It was first classified by Luis Lucien Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was highly influential in Basque linguistics of the last century.\n\n  This dialect, spoken primarily in the region of Roncalibar and its immediate area, was still going strong in the beginning of the 20th century, but recent decades have seen its use fall to just 16 speakers, among these only few who can also write in this dialect. With the help of Euskalzaindia experts, this dialect has seen some degree of revivalism, with known speakers such as Ubaldo Uhalde and  Fidela Bernat helping host classes and events held in the dialect. While these activities have seen some degree of success in the restoration of the dialect to more public use, much more work is needed for it to not completely die out, though thanks to the independence of Euskadi, the future of this dialect now seems more bright as the pressure from Spaniards to adopt their language in the region is much smaller."

BAS.301.d:0 "Cagots, or Agots, Agotak or Gafos as they are known in Euskal Herria, are a small minority people in France and Iberia, known to especially inhabit the Pyrenean mountains. Following a scandal in the recent days, their existence has risen to public consciousness once more, as a fight between a family of Cagots and a family of Basques made headlines even in national press. This fight was the result of a Cagot man marrying a Basque woman in the village of Arizkun, known for its large Cagot population, though after members of the local judiciary got involved, the matter was settled to be completely legal union of two individuals, though bad blood remains between the families for now. The reason for this scandal is the inherent pariah status of the Cagots, deriving from centuries old superstitions and prejudices.\n\n  Cagots have always been shunned in their communities, and theories of their origin are laced with racism. While modern scholars believe that Cagots are most likely some diverted branch of the Roma people, there are older, more widely circulated theories, such as one where the Cagots would be the descendants of the carpenters who created the Cross upon which Jesus was crucified on. Yet an older myth is one where the Cagots were the original workers who built the temple of Solomon. Others claim them to be members of the Cathars, a heretical branch of Christianity, though Basque historians have noted that there are mentions of Cagots even before the Cathar heresy even happened. Numerous other, more folk-story style stories have explained the pariah-status of the Cagots by claiming them to be sorcerers, werewolves, lepers or sexual deviants, and thus were removed from their communities.\n\n  What makes the origin of Cagots so much harder to understand is that they are usually completely indistinguishable from the other members of their communities, speaking the local dialects and following the majority religions of the regions, with little difference between outward appearance. Their professions, such as masonry, blacksmithing and most importantly, carpentry, are mostly chosen by Cagots due to them being forced out of different professions due to prejudice and discrimination. Several programs during the last few centuries have tried to alleviate the situation of the Cagots, especially after the French Revolution, but to this day they remain heavily segregated from the towns and cities."

Held in honour of Navarre’s patron saint, Saint Fermin, first bishop of the city of Pamplona during the 3rd century. Recently, a small change has been made to the traditions of this festival, as the mayor of Pamplona is given the chance to appoint one person from the city to launch the first firework known as txupinazo, to mark the beginning of the festival. Before independence from Spain, such a ceremony was not held, but this new invention is proving to be quite popular among the celebrators.\n\n  The week-long festival involves plenty of activities for locals and tourists alike, ranging from dancing, tournaments, speeches and musical shows, though arguably the most important event is the Running of the Bulls, where hundreds of people run in front of six bulls and six oxen over a stretch of 825 metres, the intention being to reach the Pamplona bullring. This run has caused many deaths over the years, though usually it only results in injuries of the participants, rarely being more dire than just simple concussions.\n\n  The event has been popular among foreigners, and has been hailed as incredibly Iberian event in nature, being the source of many poems, songs and stories. Before the independence of Euskadi, the run was accompanied by a chant from participants for Saint Fermin, but with the advent of the independence, this has been changed to Basque. Many Spaniards still remaining in the nation have used the festivities to protest the lack of Spanish representation in the events, but for the most part the festival has become a strong contributor to the unity of Pamplona with the Basque country as a whole, and its role in bringing in tourists from abroad cannot be understated."

The festival of drums, Donostiako Danborrada, has been launched during the midnight of January 20th, and will last an entire day, following the raising of Donostia flag by its mayor. The reverse is followed after 24 hours have passed. According to folk stories, locals used to march behind soldiers banging water buckets and other impromptu instruments to mock them after the city had been subject to prolonged sieges during the start of the century.\n\n  The tradition was borne out of this mockery, and was further reinforced when the official drum band was assembled following two donations, first the donation of wooden drums by local entrepreneur Vicente Buenechea and then, following a discovery of old Spanish uniforms in a former barracks building of the city, the costumes, both given in late 1800s to the band, giving the festival a very distinct look and sound from the various other parties and carnivals held in Basque country.\n\n  Given that the festival takes place during the night, it is traditionally been a common holiday for adults, in 1927 the first children’s version of it was held to allow the Basque youth to experience it as well, and while this tradition has not yet developed into an annual one like the main Danborrada, many politicians and members of the various clubs organizing the Danborrada have proposed that it would be held alongside the main festival to allow the Basque cultural festivals to reach the little ones as well. While primarily a musical festival, the Danborrada also has a strong culinary element, with much of the night of Danborrada reserved to Basque culinary clubs and even a women’s exclusive meal, where rare seafood is served, such as elver. With the advent of Basque independence and the increased funding to cultural institutions, the culture of Donostia is thriving, and festivals such as Danborrada have been more popular than ever before, with merchants, visitors and chefs arriving from all over the nation to attend the celebrations."

This bizarre tradition dates back centuries, with some claiming that it may very well be a leftover from the pagan Basque religion that disappeared after the conversion of the region to Catholicism in the 4th or 5th century. The highlight of these celebrations is a race, where a group of local young men challenge one another to be the first to fetch the head of a goose, tied to rope at a point in the harbour and held onto by the spectators of the race.\n\n  The participants have to grab onto the goose, a challenge in itself as the animal has been coated in grease, and while the spectators keep dipping the goose and challenger back into and out of the water, he must remove the head of the goose. If he fails, the next challenger gets his turn. The challenge is reserved only to males, as they were traditionally the ones doing manual labour and the Day of the Geese was used not only to earn prestige in the society, but also to attract the gazes of women. Should there emerge disputes between the challengers, they will be resolved in a rowboat race, though given the nature of the race, such squabbles are thankfully rare. The winner of this race gets to bring home not only the head of the goose, but also the rest of it, a valuable price.\n\n The role of the animal in these races is generally attributed to Basque paganism, as one of the central gods of the Basque mythos, Mari, and her consort, Sugaar, were often depicted as shapeshifters, who could transform into animals to interact with their worshippers. Thus, the sacrifice of the animal in a battle of strength bears cultural significance. Many researchers of Basque paganism, such as the renowned Basque archeologist Jose Migel Barandiaran Aierbe, have praised the festival for keeping the local tradition alive and returning Basques to their earliest recorded roots."

These comics were originally made by Arrue during the war to boost morale on the ground and to show Basque perspective into the wider collapse of Spanish order in Iberia, but their uniquely Basque viewpoint and distinctively artstyle have attracted quite a bit of interest among the revolutionaries of the world. They’ve become somewhat popular in Ireland too, a large supporter of our cause for independence and republicanism, and have made the artist even more popular internationally than before.\n\n  Known for his love of the Basque countryside, he has mixed realism as an art form with the traditions and peasant lifestyles of the Biscayan coastline. His days as a bullfighter and political cartoonist have made him an easily marketable figure, and his international recognition following the 1928 exhibitions of his works as far away as Uruguay have made him a natural ambassador of Basque art. While many conservatives and traditionalists woe the fact that his art mainly attracts radicals, they have at least been content with the subjects of his paintings and cartoons. The boost in Jose’s career has not come at the expense of his three brothers, Alberto, Ramiro, and Ricardo, who have also had their works shown in the halls of the art museums and exhibitions of the Internationale following their brother’s soaring success. This has been met with great applause by the Basque cultural community, and is bound to attract more tourism and cultural cooperation with the international cultural elites."

The institute, led currently by the famous Basque philologist Resurrección María de Azkue, has published an article in their newspaper Euskera, pleading the government to allocate some funding for the planning and construction of a statue in Bilbao, celebrating the international heroes of the Euskaran research. The statue would likely be constructed in front of the Euskaltzaindia building, though the character depicted is still being debated by the members of the institute, and several possibilities have been raised. Most popular currently is to have the statue built after Louis Lucien Bonaparte, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, known as one of the most important vascologists of his time.\n\n  His contributions not only to the Basque language, but to several Celtic languages on the verge of being forgotten, such as Cornish, make him a tempting candidate to honour, but the issue is that our neighbours in the Commune of France could see this as an insult. Another option would be Hugo Schuchardt, a German philologist who sadly passed away around a decade ago, and whose contributions to the Basque language have been immense, especially in his research of the various pidgins that Basques and their trading partners in America and elsewhere developed.\n\n  However, Schuchardt is a difficult candidate because he was known to be a dogged supporter of the Vasco-Iberian theory in relation to Basque language roots, a theory that is generally considered obsolete and denounced by Basque nationalists.

BAS.307.d:0 "A curious case of Catalan-Basque cooperation has been revealed to public, as the Catalan inventor Alejandro Finisterre has paired up with his Basque friend, carpenter Francisco Javier Altuna, to finalize the design of Finisterre’s patent, a first prototype of an invention he calls foosball. He received the idea for the invention when injured during the Catalan independence war, following a Spanish air raid on Barcelona.\n\n  While recovering from being buried alive in the bombing, Finisterre realized that many veterans of the wars raging over Iberia would never again be able to partake in the most beloved sport of Spaniards, football. His new invention is aimed especially to help those children, damaged by the war in a physical way, to discover the joys of football in another form. Altuna’s design of Finisterre’s patent involves. The game involves multiple rotating bars with ‘players’ being simulated with wooden or metallic pieces attached to these bars, and the actual players are able to move these characters from side to side and front to back to adjust the playing field, strength of kicks and the formation of the defence, similar to actual football.\n\n  The easy nature of the game and relative simplicity of manufacturing the game platforms are bound to make this invention widespread in Iberia, especially now that factories peninsula-wide are being geared towards civilian production once more. While invented and patented in Barcelona originally, Finisterre’s partner Altuna has negotiated a deal with a local toy factory in Bilbao to start producing a Basque copy of foosball as well. "

BAS.308.d:0 "As Basque industry returns to pre-war civilian production once more, the nation has seen an increased interest in foreign markets. The Spanish economy was quite insular in nature, but with Bilbao’s mighty factories and the varied agricultural and maritime products of the Biscayan coast, many consider the tiny nation of Euskadi to be the next contender for an economic miracle. This renewed interest in foreign trade has seen an uptick in Basque traditional products, ranging from the famous cider to maritime vessels made by Euskalduna all the way to the humble clothing item, the beret. Traditionally a Navarran design, though examples of it are also known to have been made in Iparralde, Aragon and Southern France, the beret is both a traditional headwear and a status symbol in Basque society.\n\n  Known as txapela or boneta, berets were often given out as prices during the bertso rural sports, and the beret in general is widely associated with rural folk, originating from sheepherders and farmers of the Pyrenean mountains. Textile mills and factories have started churning out these headgears in large numbers, both to satiate the new domestic market as patriotic Basques want their own txapelas or bonetas in traditional red colour to show off their new homeland, but also in more varied colours to be sold to foreign markets. French, Italian and Nordic customers have already sent in quite a few offers to buy out the existing stock, though especially Communards tend to view their domestic designs as superior.\n\n  An unexpected cultural exchange has also happened with the Scottish visitors to Euskadi, as they have exchanged their traditional bonnet berets to those made by the Basques, leading to further talks about setting up a smaller production line to produce these Scottish specialities. Basque industrialists hope to capitalize on the increased interest in berets as they have become a desired item of women’s fashion worldwide, though the conflicts raging around the globe will most likely see sales dwindle a bit."

BAS.309.d:0 "The recent resurgence of Basque cuisine on global stage has brought closer attention to the state of the Basque traditional home-made wine, txakoli. This traditional beverage has languished over the last century, as wines from other regions of Spain and France have made it less and less popular among the Basques. However, with the supply to rest of Spain cut off, txakoli has made a surprise return to the tables of Basques and Navarrans, especially in regions of Biscay, Getaria and Alava. It is typically fermented in massive oak barrels over time, and cannot be stored for more than year due to the nature of the wine, though some variations have a little longer life when bottled.\n\n  Quite versatile in nature, txakoli is made both from white and red grapes, and the nature of the grapes tends to affect the resulting product, with even more variations based on the region of origin, or even the town or village of origin. Served normally with pintxos, it has become a cornerstone of the new Basque cuisine, and many fairs are currently being planned in the traditional winemaking regions of Alab and Getaria to celebrate the traditional wine variants, some dating back even to the 700 or 800 AD. Curiously, the resurrection of this wine type has seen the Basque descendants in Chile reach out to their Iberian counterparts, sharing the local South American variants of txakoli with their Basque colleagues and inviting those that can to their annual Fiesta del Chacolí, held in the town of Doñihue in honour of the traditional drink."

Sancho de Beurko, or Luis Ruiz de Aguirre Urkixo as he is known by his birth name, was the General Comissioner of the Eusko Gudarostea during the war, and commanded the Ist Corps of the army. While he has began to take a more active role in the politics of EAE after the war, his contribution to the war effort was immense, and his civil profession as  a historian has given him a knack for retelling the battles of the independence war in a way that has captured the hearts and minds of Basque patriots, no matter the ideological leaning.\n\n  However, his reports were first picked up by Catalan and Galician contemporaries, reminiscing the glory days of the war of resistance, and from there they spread to the Internationale and Reichspakt, earning both praise and interest to the fledgling Basque army. Spanish officials have denounced the retellings as falsified slander of the Spanish military, but given their defeat in the hands of the Basques have made many ignore these claims. Many members of EAE and the Basque military, such as Tomas Bilbao and Candido Saseto, have even suggested that Sancho writes a comprehensive historical analysis of the war as there is clearly a lot of interest in the war Euskadi fought against Spain."

The local fishermen used dynamite to fell the great mammal, finally finishing it off as other, more purpose-built methods of whalers had fallen out of use by then. There have been several sightings of whales in the Bay of Biscay since then, but the local fishermen have decided not to or have been unable to pursue these creatures.\n\n  As such, this final catch, especially due to the unorthodox nature of the final blow, has become a source of local celebration, and every five years, a small festival is held in its honour. Basque whaling itself peaked in the 1600s, with a whaling empire reaching from the coast of Biscay all the way to Svalbard, Finnmark, Greenland and Newfoundland to the Eastern coast of Brazil. For a few centuries, Basque whalers were legendary members of the international community, but the decline in global whale population, persecution from locals and the dire straits of Spanish empire in the 1700s and 1800s meant that the Basques gradually abandoned this trade and moved into other pursuits.\n\n  Still, stories of great beasts hunted from the depths by brave seamen are very much alive in the community today, and many young sailors still dream of the glory days of yore as they set on their first voyages off the ports of Bilbao, Orio, Lekeitio and Donostia."

Suggested by Jose Antonio Aguirre and José María Belaustegigoitia, this joint EAE-EAJ effort has been approved by the Basque government. Partially, it is meant to promote the new nation internationally and continue the proud tradition of Basque football, first brought to the nation by various Basque students who spent time in British universities, and partially to fund the reconstruction of Euskal Herria after the war with Spain. Manned by such venerable footballers such as Isidro Lángara, Txato Iraragorri and Gregorio Blasco, the new team is comprised of people from Athletic Club and a handful of Spanish teams such as F.C. Madrid, as well as smaller Basque clubs and sports organization.\n\n  Formed on the basis of the earlier Vasconia selection, the team is expected to perform well even in international matches due to the impressive victories it has had against Catalan teams in the past. Currently, the players are Basque only, though given the relatively large number of EAE members in the team, they may soon expand recruitment to Spaniards who have chosen to live in Euskadi.

Group of Spanish nationalists, possibly belonging to the Liga de Acción Monárquica, attacked the house in the dead of the night short weeks after the reinstitution of the cursed Alfonsine monarchy, and while their attack was unsuccessful in destroying the house, it was left damaged and cordoned off by the Guardia Civil troops in order to stop Basque nationalists from using it as a rallying point.\n\n  However, following the Basque independence, it has been almost universally agreed to restore the homestead of Basque nationalism’s father to its former glory, with the funding provided by the sale of seized Spanish nationalist assets, chief among the various business magnates and nobles belonging to the aforementioned LAM.

Following the Basque independence and subsequent struggle against Spaniards, the bridge was damaged by rogue Spanish army troops who, in their arrogance thought that Bilbao would soon fall to the Spanish forces, dynamited the bridge to ensure that no reinforcements could use it. While the perpetrators were shot in the ensuing firefight, the bridge remained out of use until now. The first bridge of its kind in the world, it was designed by Alberto de Palacio to solve the dilemma of allowing maritime trade to reach the port of Bilbao while also allowing travel between the two towns on opposite sides of the Nervin river.\n\n  Alberto de Palacio actually lives close by the bridge today, choosing to remain in Basque country due to his advanced age even despite the independence, and he has assisted in the rebuilding of the bridge by giving such a degree of expert advice the builders would have been wholly incapable of getting otherwise. Palacio, a pupil of Gustave Eiffel and a famed architect and engineer in his own right, is primarily known for his works with various palaces and elaborately constructed greenhouses in Madrid, but to the Basques, his pioneering work with Bizkaito Zubia will always remain number one, especially given the help provided by the master in rebuilding his creation. The bridge itself has eight railcars used to transport passengers over the seemingly short distance of 164 metres, hanging 45 metres over the water.

The new pieces were originally meant for the movie La malquerida by José López Rubio, but as Basques separated themselves from the Spanish kingdom, this collaboration was severed and the film studio behind La Malquerida, Ufifilms, sought a Spanish composer instead. Nonetheless, the release of Guridi’s newest collection has been a strong success, further propelling the composer into national relevance. He has previously been a favourite of many Basque nationalists for his love of Basque folklore and history, which has influenced many of the themes present in the songs composed by Guridi. \n\n Musically, Guridi is something of a style nomad, creating operas, symphonies, tracks for films and even pieces intended for children with the same vigour and interest, though it is undeniable that the man has a love for the organ that cannot be surpassed by any other instrument, and his work on transforming traditional Basque folk songs to be played on organ has been received well by those clergymen that harbour patriotic ideals.

Bertsos are an unique form of Basque musical performance, an improvised song made up on the spot with a melody taken from, for example, a traditional song. Usually the Bertsolari is assigned a theme or a set of words to form their piece from, and these themes are, more often than not, something humorous, even when addressing real issues or talking points.\n\n  A common theme is also the politics of the day, though many Bertsolaris have noted that now that they do not have the incompetence of Spanish administration to complain about, their job is a bit harder. Nevertheless, given the nature of politics, there are more than enough subjects for them to cover. Bertsos are a relatively freeform in their presentation, stemming from their historical role as informal entertainment. and the freedom to use the Bertsolari’s own dialect has made Bertsolari championships a true gathering of the various Basque dialects, not only in the provinces of Euskal Herria proper, but also from the regions of Navarre and even Iparralde. The winner of these tournaments and championships receives the txapela, winner’s beret, similar to the rural sports held in the region. Championships in Donostia have been held in since 1935, though the advent of Basque war of independence made the government cancel the tournament for that year.\n\n  Now, however, it seems like the Bertsolari culture is here to stay. Unfortunately, the original groups of Bertsolaris, belonging to the so called eskolatu gabeak generation, made up of those Bertsolaris who were illiterate, have slowly began to die out due to old age, and many Bertsolaris and scholars of Basque music or language are scrambling to the countryside to archive their many contributions to this unique art form. The most notable recent death of a Bertsolari from this generation was that of Txirrita, who died in 1936 and the subsequent tournament was held in his honour. The current generation of Bertsolaris has mainly been made up of literate Bertsolaris, though according to experts this has not massively changed the landscape of Bertso culture."

However, this has not left the four other breeds of Navarra and Euskal Herria in shade, as they have also gotten their spotlight in celebrations. The Pachón Navarro, a popular hunting dog, has become a staple of the Basque middle class as they brave the wilds of Euskadi in search of prey, the dog serving in a role its ancestors already fulfilled in the Middle Ages with the kings and nobles of the Kingdom of Navarro. The ratter dogs of Enkarterriko Billanuko and the traditional hare hunters of Erbi Txakurra race have been the winners of the Basque independence, however, as their declining numbers have seen a rise as more and more Basques choose these dog breeds over other, Spanish and French alternatives.\n\n  Erbi Txakurra has seen its role change as well, as its traditional prey, hare, are struggling to maintain their numbers, so the dog breed’s prey has transformed to wild boars and deers instead of the smaller and less fierce foes. Finally, the Enkarterriko Billanoa, a beloved worker dog not specifically limited to Euskal Herria alone, has continued its duty of serving as the companions of the Manchina cattle, exploring the mighty mountains of the Pyrenees with their horned companions as they have done for centuries. All these breeds have been thoroughly celebrated as the hardy friends of the Basque people, and while Spanish and French dog breeds will hardly disappear from Euskadi, many presume that these five breeds will see an immense resurgence in the coming years, as is deserved for these loyal animals."

This man, a Basque noble by the name of Juan Pedro Aladro y Kastriota, served as a diplomat for Spain in the 1800s, making numerous visits to Central Europe and the Austrian empire. While there, he became increasingly interested in the Albanian cause for independence, and while mingling with Albanian nobility and elite, Aladro became convinced that he was related to Kastrioti family line. Albanian politician Eqrem bey Vlora supported his claim, and Aladro would go on to sponsor Albanian schools, student clubs and even provided funding for the Albanian nationalist newspaper, La Nazione Albanese.\n\n Pushing his claim further, he set up a network of Albanian aides who distributed postcards, leaflets and even revolvers under his name in the Albanian territory, causing the Ottoman overlords of the territory to ban the spreading of his postcards. The operation was already hampered without the ban as Visko Babatasi, the person in charge of the operation, took the money and ran to the Americas, though the entire debacle did cause the Ottomans to offer the title of Wali in Albania to Aladro, who in turn tried to push for further Albanian autonomy and the negotiations broke down. Aladro would be honoured after the first Albanian congress, when he was discussed as a possible prince of Albania, but his Catholic religion made him a difficult candidate in the majority Muslim region. Aladro may have overcome these difficulties eventually, but his life and possible leadership of Albania was cut short by his death in 1914.\n\n What makes him particularly fondly remembered in Euskadi today, however, is his love for the region and its language, and the Don was a frequent writer of the Euskal Erria newspaper, ending his articles with the phrase ‘Euskalerria aurrera, Shkiperia perpara’, meaning ‘Forward Basque Country, forward Albania’. His recent promotion among Basque nationalists has been mainly done to remember the eccentric yet popular Don, but also to promote the bond between Albania and Basques, two nations who managed to escape the claws of their former rulers. An idea about opening a Euskadi-Shkiperia Friendship Society to reestablish this bond has been circulated among the Basque nationalists of various parties, though any concrete connection is yet to be made towards the Albanians."

In 1931, following the proclamation of the Second Spanish republic and the implementation of the left-wing government’s anticlerical programs, children in the town of Ezquioga began to see visions of the Virgin Mary, who appeared to two different groups of children, reportedly saying ‘Do not mistreat my son’.\n\n These reports, while lambasted by the left-wing media, attracted thousands of visitors to the small village, and hundreds claimed to have seen visions of blinding light, with some falling unconscious and even bleeding from these visions. The left-wing press was not the only ones to criticize the phenomenon, for even the Spanish Catholic Church claimed it to be an example of mass hysteria with nationalist aims, and the famed Irish Hispanist Walter Starkie, who visited the region during the situation, claimed it to be a clearly political move. Nonetheless, for the people present in Ezquioga during the events, it was very much a strong religious experience, and Basque nationalists used it as a means to promote separation from Spain, especially after the repressive period after Sarjurjada.\n\n After the experience, Carlists and republican seers of the event have come out to talk about their experiences, and many now view it as the first sign from God that Euskadi was the preferred Iberian nation, not corrupted by the anti-clericalism of the Republic or the thuggish false Catholicism of the military and Accion Popular."

This led to a lot of Jewish places of worship being repurposed over time to take on a different function. In Vitoria-Gasteiz however, an agreement was reached between the locals and the Jews, with the people of the region promising to continue maintaining the local Jewish cemetery.

Surprised by this request, the city council has agreed to it, and the cemetery of Judizmendi shall continue to be maintained by locals for the foreseeable future.

The man would see many decades of prosperous trade, and he became known for his very pro-woman stances as the majority of Fournier’s card makers were women, known as naiperas. Fournier’s company would be one of the major ones to allow women to climb the ranks and become administrators, machinists and other more prestigious roles. Following Heraclio’s death in 1916, his grandson Félix Alfaro Fournier took over leadership of the company and his reign would see the cardmakers of Fournier create a veritable monopoly over the two decades in Spain.\n\n Following the Basque independence, the company obviously took a hit from the strife, but given the international fame the company has garnered, the company soon bounced back and is planning to expand its operations to industrial towns in Euskal Herria, such as Bilbao, Mondragon and Eibar. Fournier’s interest in playing cards is not only business-minded in nature, for he has created something of a collection around rare playing cards from all over Spain over the years. The monopoly that the Fournier company achieved helped this collection to grow, as the various warehouses acquired by the company from former competitors contained many older and rarer variants that now rest in Felix Fournier’s collection. When visiting other nations on business trips, the business magnate spends a considerable time hunting for rare examples to add to his collection, though most of his decks, notably the starting ones in his collection manufactured by Josef de Monjardín and J. J. Maciá, are Spanish and Catalan.\n\n His collection has been inspired by the Bielefeld Playing Card Museum in Germany, and Fournier wishes to one day open a museum of his own once the collection grows substantial enough, though as of now it’s only available to those within Fournier’s own family and associate circle. Fournier is known fondly in the region, as he has sponsored plenty of institutions related to Basque culture in the province of Álava, such as the football Club Deportivo Alavés and the Vitoria School of Arts and Crafts. He also supports the ongoing project to create Museum of Fine Arts of Álava, though it is currently only in planning phase, and he has been aiming to fund a museum related to weapons and armours of the Basque region sometime in the future, though knowing how many irons the man has in the fire, this may take more than a decade to come to fruition."

Unlike his brother, Heraclio never exhibited much interest in the business of their grandfather, also named Heraclio, who's playing card business led to the eventual mass hit of the Fournier playing cards over the globe. Heraclio Fournier’s passion since adolescence has always been aviation, and ever since the 1910s, he has been involved in the creation and design of planes. At merely the age of 16, he and a group of friends created a glider called ACHA, and a year later Fournier would get to fly on a French Antoinette plane, though given his young age, he had to wait until he was 18 to be allowed into the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, as its youngest member no less.\n\n His first unique creation was the Alfaro I plane, first domestic plane in Spain and also world first in utilizing a negative horizontal tail. He would go on to create other variants of the Alfaro series, and eventually found his place in the national flight school of ENA in Madrid, where he would work until the closure of the school in the end of the 1910s. He would design planes on the side, and his Alfaro 8 design competed for a military trial but unfortunately crashed during testing and was thus not accepted for obvious reasons. Fournier became interested in helicopters while working in Barcelona, but this fascination was somewhat cut short after he joined many Spaniards in emigrating to the United States, to work on the Dayton aircraft company under the aerial legend Orville Wright.\n\n He would spend more than a decade in the States, building new models of aircraft and helicopters, working as an intermediary between Juan de la Cierva and the Pitcairn company. His designs during the American period included the PCA-2-30 helicopter, X-13 plane noted for its innovative and efficient design and the barrel engine that he developed as part of his new firm called Aircraft Developments Inc. However, when the American turmoils began, he sought refuge in Spain in his hometown of Vitoria, and when Basques gained their independence, this titan of local aviation offered his services to the new state. His knowledge of aircraft is well-known, and the government is seeking to offer him funding in opening the first domestic Basque air factory, possibly in Vitoria as a sister company of the Fournier playing cards company. Whatever the future holds for Heraclio Fournier, it is clear that his experience may very well make this small corner of Iberia the very heart of the peninsula’s aviation for decades to come."

Working in Donostia, using a carpentry workshop and funds provided by a wealthy Pamplonan donor, the trio built the plane to match the Wright specifications.\n\nThe donor had wanted to see the sights of Pamplona from the air, and thus was prepared to fund the project. For this reason, Pamplona was first expected to be the place of testing, but there were very few suitable areas there to launch an airplane from. Donostia itself also lacked any nearby fields or other flat ground from which to attempt getting AMA into the air from. As such, the town of Vitoria and its Lakua field was chosen, and the vehicle was transported there. The field needed a degree of landscaping to become operational, as it was filled with potholes and other obstructions, but eventually it was ready for the task at hand.\n\nUnfortunately for Amestoy, Múgica and Azcona, the tests were a failure, and the dream of a Basque (or Spanish, for that matter) plane taking air would have to wait four more years until the Alfaro I would pioneer the Iberian aviation industry. Yet the example of AMA is fondly remembered even today by the Aviation Club of Vitoria, as they still continue to take air from the Lakua field with their far more advanced crafts and gliders today. Interestingly enough, the airfield of Lakua served as an ad hoc reconnaissance center during the independence war, as a few of the local flyboys provided aerial recon to the brave Basque soldiers fighting the Spanish invaders. In a way, the importance of the three Basque aviators was thus far more meaningful than they may have ever expected."

BAS.326.t:0 "The Gunsmith Craze of Eibar"
BAS.326.d:0 "The territory of Euskal Herria has long been known for its strong metallurgical industry. For millennia local blacksmiths and later, machinists, have created wonderful works from all sorts of metals. However, an interesting phenomenon rose from the local conditions of Spain following the start of the First World War, as Euskal Herria rose to become the very home of Spanish gunsmithing. The needs of a total war forced all resources of the European powers to be focused towards getting more weapons of war, and as the war grew more and more stagnant, heavy artillery, tanks, aircraft and other large weapons demanded more production resources than things like rifles and pistols. This was especially true for France, that found itself in need of large quantities of handguns, but the nation had far more pressing priorities in the armament industry to fulfill these quotas.\n\nBasques, with their fledgling gun industry, provided a solution. The town of Eibar was home to five gunmaker companies, largest of which was the Llama-Gabilondo y Cia SA. They created the small .32 ACP pistol known as the Ruby, which would become the mainstay of French forces during the Weltkrieg. Ruby was very much just an improved copy of the Browning 1903, but whereas rest of the world was heavily bound by copyright laws, the Spanish copyright laws at the time allowed gunmakers to make copies of famous weapons as long as the designer of said gun did not hold patent rights in Spain. This led to an enormous industry of copycat guns, and Ruby was perhaps the most successful of all. This success was borne out of the French order, as the French army ordered ten thousand Ruby pistols from Llama-Gabilondo, sending the company into absolute sheer panic when they realized the magnitude of the order compared to staff, which at the time numbered less than ten people.\n\nThe company diverted production to the other four gunsmithing companies of Eibar, signing a contract for each of them to produce 5000 pistols that would then be inspected by the main company before shipping to France. The handguns proved popular, but this created another problem for Llama-Gabilondo, as orders rose to thirty thousand and subsequently, to fifty thousand. Other local shops and factories caught on to this new lucrative trade, and companies manufacturing Ruby pistols soared in numbers, some working for Llama-Gabilondo and others negotiating direct deals with the French procurement office.\n\nThese pistols would follow the same general structure but vary greatly in both quality and parts, yet the quality never reached a point where the French would be dissatisfied, and the massive trade of cheap pistols would kickstart Llama’s rise to becoming one of Spain’s main gun companies, a rise that only continues today. With Basque independence and the war clouds gathering in the horizon, some in Eibar look at the situation with an opportunistic glee, as the war could prove to be yet another hit for the gunmakers of the Basque town, with possibly another Ruby Klondike coming their way, though whether the Communards would be as willing to trade with the Basques as the French Republic was remains another question entirely."

BAS.327.d:0 "Recently, Basque sports have started to see the rise of a new popular sport thanks to the enthusiasm of Teófilo Mingueza, local son of Vitoria and filmmaker-inventor, who has started organizing cycling races in the difficult tracks of Pyrenean mountainsides. Back when Euskal Herria was still under the Spanish yoke, Mingueza participated into the Spanish Road Cycling Championship under the team Montpeó-Klein team, and even managed to snatch a victory in the Infanta Isabel Silver Cup. However, as the Basques managed to gain their independence, there has been little in the way of cycling races held between the Iberian splinters, but Mingueza has seemingly not let this get to him, as he has begun organizing races of this type even in the difficult conditions of Euskal Herria. They’ve gained surprising popularity, especially in the coastal and mountainous areas, and have helped bring more popularity to the bicycle, which up until now was still relatively scarce in the region.\n\nIn addition to his athletic interests, Mingueza works as a filmmaker and cameraman, and his inventions in the field of camera technology have become relatively sought after even internationally, among the film studios of both Internationale and Reichspakt. His most famous creation was a panoramic camera, which could create a 365 degree image, which he has utilized in some of his creations. Mingueza often utilizes his hometown of Vitoria as a source for his artistic work, capturing landmarks and daily life in the town for his work. While the Basque film scene has not yet even started, there have been some remarks from Mingueza towards the possibility of opening a small studio to document the life of Euskadi’s new sovereignty."

BAS.328.t:0 "Revival of Basque Mythos"
BAS.328.d:0 "The arrival of Basque independence has been a gigantic boon to the local archeological societies, as the new government of Euskadi has provided ample funding to these academics. This has seen an increased interest in rediscovering the mythos of Basque paganism, lost to the passage of time after the region of Euskal Herria was gradually converted to Christianity between 4th and 12th century. José Miguel Barandiaran, a famed Basque archaeologist, has been instrumental in this preservation of what little scraps remain, and his collection of Basque folklore is up to date the largest collection of Basque pre-historian culture, with the rest of the sources being either pilgrims, conquerors such as the Arabs, or local missionaries from the Middle Ages.\n\n Based on what little Barandiaran and other folklorists have been able to gather throughout the years, it seems that there was a singular female deity Mari, and possibly her consort Sugaar, that existed in the Basque pantheon. Considering the importance of weather to the two traditional Basque professions, farming and fishing, it’s not a great surprise that Mari was considered a deity of weather, bringing droughts and hail as she travelled the land while her stays at her home in Anboto, the mountain most often associated as her home, would bring wet weather over Basque lands. She was associated with many things, such as lightning or red animals, though many descriptions of her also show her as a woman in red. Sugaar, on the other hand, has very little information on him, and is mostly just known as the dragon deity, possibly with a form similar to the ancient Basque lauburu hooked cross.\n\n Sugaar is also often described to have appeared in the form of a large fireball to predate the beginning of large storms. While he is not often described in myths, one such rare story describes Sugaar as having seduced a Scottish princess, who later gave birth to Jaun Zuria, the first lord of Biskaia. There is one more hypothetical god known as Urtzi, who may have lorded over the sky, but the Basque academics of folk lore and archaeology consider him to possibly just be a word for the sky without larger spiritual meaning.\n\n There were other mythological creatures as well, such as the Basajaun and Jentilak, sort of local versions of the wild man story present in multiple cultures, with the both these creatures being hairy large men-like creatures residing in remote parts of the Pyrenees, main difference being in their intelligence as the former was described as human-level of intellect while the latter was a mere humanoid beast. Some academics have suggested that the origin of these stories is a copy of the Roman Sylvans, while others consider them a folk myth of the Neanderthals. Other creatures include the seven-headed dragon Heresuge, though Herensuge is not a singular creature but seemingly multiple similar dragons. Many of the Basque folklore creatures coincide with the myths of other European nations, but many Basque archaeologists argue that they could possibly predate the myths of the Indo-Europeans. Whatever the case, the recent interest in Basque archaeology has seen it gain more and more traction within the Basque society, and old festivals dating back to pagan traditions, such as the Day of Geese and Olentzero are slowly being revived by locals countrywide."

BAS.329.d:0 "After the Basque independence, the new nation set out to establish itself as a sovereign member of the international community, and nowhere was this more clear than Latin America. Countries with significant Basque diaspora, such as Chile, Peru and Argentina were the first to be greeted with gifts of our small faraway land, and diplomatic relations remain relatively warm. Even Latin American countries with few Basques have gotten their fair share of Basque diplomats and ambassadors travelling there, including the small Caribbean nations of Dominican Republic and Haiti. Yet it appears that the Dominican Republic under its Caudillo Rafael Trujillo is little different than his Spanish counterparts, Sanjurjo and Primo de Rivera for example, as one of our esteemed diplomats and lecturers has gone missing while on a diplomatic mission to the Caribbean nation.\n\nJesús Galíndez was sent to the nation even before Basque independence to facilitate smooth transition in relations between our two nations, and he experienced firsthand how Rafael Trujillo rose to power. Based on these experiences, Galíndez appears to have been working on a report to international actors about the brutal regime happening in Dominican Republic, but it would appear that the regime found out about his investigation. Galíndez went missing shortly after sending his latest report back to Euskadi, and our associates in the nation have reported that the Trujillo administration may have offered to pay for the research reports, something that Galíndez seems to have declined.\n\nIt would appear that Galíndez may have been attempting to get the manuscript published and circulated by Latin American allies of the Ligue des droits de l'homme, but these plans never came to fruition. It is likely that Galíndez is murdered, or hidden in a cell somewhere in Trujillo’s prisons, though the latter option seems less likely by the day. When these news reached the Basque public, the outrage was, understandably, gigantic, and calls for the fledgling Basque navy to set sail and crush the Trujillo regime have become incredibly common both in the streets and the parliament of the nation. However, other suggest that merely cutting relations with Trujillo and his bastard regime is enough, for we do not possess the logistical capabilities currently to end his cruel reign."

BAS.330.d:0 "The local branch of Carlists, Elkarte Tradizionalista, has long held an antagonistic relationship with the Basque republic, and despite their assistance in the war against the Bourbons, many within their ranks still consider Euskal Herria to be an integral part of Spain. Reports from the Ertzana’s internal security branch also indicate, that the Carlists may have absorbed the dangerous and traitorous monarchists of Lliga de Acción Monárquica. Together with the fact that they retain a large number of Spanish royalist sympathizers and are reportedly still training more Errekete paramilitaries. There has even been rumours that certain high ranking Carlist figures, such as Manuel Fal Conde and Jaime del Burgo, have travelled to Navarre to organize the local Erreketes and Carlist organizations in preparation of the pretender king’s arrival. Alarmists among the ranks of the government have called for an immediate intervention, as many believe the Carlists will launch an attack against the government of the Republic once their leadership has consolidated itself. These alarmists believe that we should utilize the entire might of the Ertzana to smite their militias or just force them to surrender outright given the numerical advantage our police possesses, but the risks involved are substantial. This approach could easily lead to a bloodbath, and even if we emerged triumphant, it would be a scandal that the government is so ready to use violence against political opponents. On the other hand, a victory would solve the issue with Carlists once and for all. Other, more cautious supporters of intervention have pointed out that the Carlists rely heavily on the local Basque population, who, despite being committed to the traditionalist cause, are patriots of Euskadi all the same, and are not comfortable with the idea of bleeding for their Spanish leadership only to become a minority once more, fueros honoured or not. As such, the promoters of a cautious approach claim that we should exploit the patriotism of these Basques to sow division among their movement, especially since many Carlists mingle with the republicans on the regular. Finally, we could just leave the Carlists be, as these rumours are likely to just be old wives’ tall tales, but the risk is always there."

The government now fears that the Spanish Carlists may be attempting to sway the regional leadership into attempting an armed insurrection or coup, as there is little love lost between Basque Carlists and Republicans. However, traditionalists within the Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea and Aberri believe that if negotiations were opened with the Carlists and a degree of understanding was reached between them, the situation may come to pass peacefully. Others, especially among the more left-wing parties, see the Carlist threat as too big to risk negotiations, and are calling for immediate military action.

Gunfire roared across the ancient mountains as the Red Berets faced the Gudaris of Basque army, running battles continuing throughout the day with seemingly no end in sight. The Erreketes, outnumbered but not outmatched, kept luring the Gudaris further into their territory, whittling down their strength with accurate Mauser fire. The soldiers neared the Carlist stronghold of Pamplona, where few remaining republican militants had been encircled and slowly rooted out. The troops of Eusko Gudarostea mustered for a final attack on the citadel of traditionalism, but as their advance begun, it was clear that the battle was not in their favour. The military’s troops weren’t ready for such a siege, and as the concentrated fire of the Carlists cut into their ranks, many turned and ran from the battle. This shameful display led to the total collapse of the Eusko Gudarostea force, with only a small contingent of independence war veterans pressing on. Led by the Jeltzale politician and war hero Candido Saseto, they struck a mighty blow to the Carlist defenders, reaping a toll on their numbers before finally dying to the last man in the killing fields.

The Basque provisional government had evacuated Bilbao, and the Carlists prepared to march on the parliament of the city. However, the Erreketes were beset by a new force, as the city’s unionists from the socialist, anarchist and even Catholic unions had banded under the leadership of the anarchist Felix Likiniano. Likiniano’s group Dynamite had stepped into the power vacuum left by the collapse of Basque government, and now posed the only real threat to the machinations of the Carlists. Clashes between the unions of Euskadi and the Carlist militias happened all over the city, with varying results. The unionists utilized tactics derived from Likiniano’s experiences during the 1934 Asturias revolt, ambushing Erreketes on the narrow streets and causing terrible losses by utilizing dynamite as makeshift grenades. The unionists had been able to get a lot of weapons from the barracks of Donostia thanks to the knowledge of Felix Likiniano, as he had served there in the beginning of 1930s. However, the Carlists still possessed an advantage in experience and weapon quality, and their push towards the city centre continued at a relatively quick pace.

BAS.334.t:0 "The Erromitxela Language"
BAS.334.d:0 "As the language research institute Euskaltzaindia has set to work on standardizing the Euskara language, there have been scholars who have become increasingly interested in local dialects of both Euskara, Spanish and French that have developed in the Pyrenees region. But as research into these aspects of local culture has deepened, some scholars such as Pierre Allande Hegi from Iparralde, have published some works related to a cultural aspect of Basque society often left unexplored. This is the small group of Roma people in Euskal Herria, known locally as ijitoak, or perhaps even more accurately, as Erromintxela, partially after the name of their language and partially to distinguish this group from other Romanis in Iberia, such as the Caló Romani typically seen in rest of Iberia and the Cascarot Romani in Iparralde. The Basque Roma are unique from their counterparts in most other areas of Europe in that they have become a far more integrated part of Euskal Herria’s society, and their language reflects this quirk well, given that it uses the Kalderash Romani vocabulary, hailing from the origins of the ijitoak, but the grammar is directly derived from Euskara. This is partially also explained in the bilinguality of the ijitoak, and scientists at Euskaltzaindia have collaborated with the anthropologists, historians and sociologists of other Basque universities to determine what drives the close link between Basques and their Roma neighbours. Typically, the Roma peoples are treated harshly around Europe, being targets of superstition, racism and even eugenics programs that seek to neuter their populations due to perceived inferiority. The source of these beliefs often comes from the Romani desire for isolation from society, and peculiar customs related to hygiene, but such prejudices are rare in Euskal Herria. The government has granted funding to Euskaltzaindia to further explore the matter, though given the immense workload the institute has in regards to reforming Euskaran language, it’s likely the fruits of the Erromintxela program will only be seen much, much later."

Food is not necessarily scarce, but things like cattle meat, different crops of cereal and various fruits have become a luxury only available to those sourcing them through Reichspakt market. While Euskadi has its own production of these items too, the government has approached the food crisis with relatively authoritarian measures, rationing food for the population. This rationing has obviously made backyard gardening, foraging and shore fishing more common around the nation as people look for alternative sources of nutrition to supplement the state-mandated foods, but a far more primitive tradition has also seen a rise in popularity. The cats of Euskadi’s cities and towns have seen a sharp decline in population as people catch these pets to act in place of hares or poultry. \n\nThese cats, when caught and killed for food, are laid in salt for 24 hours, and basted following this procedure. They are served with a sauce usually made from sherry and mushrooms, though given the scarcity of resources, improvised ingredients have become more and more common. This survivalist approach to pets is hardly new, as the very poorest neighbours of Bilbao and around all of Euskal Herria have been rumoured to hunt cats for food in the past as well. However, owners of these pets have pleaded the government to take action against such barbarous actions, fearing for the safety of their pets and also speculating that should the cat population collapse, the rats would overrun Bilbao and other cities."

Some grain supplies have been purchased from the Internationale, but the situation is still relatively dire, and the government has resorted to producing state bread.\n\nGiven the shortages, every part of the grain received has been used to make bread, resulting in a dark, bitter and heavy bread type that is wholly antithetical to the usual Basque bread. Immediately, suspicions about the edibility of the bread started to circulate, and many have claimed that the government is peddlin toxic bread to its citizens. Some claim that eating the state bread leads to lunacy for men, others say that if pregnant women eat it, they will suffer miscarriages. It’s making the people of Euskadi increasingly untrusting of the government, and many are resorting to buying the bread from the black market to avoid having to deal with the alleged side effects. Given the devastation of the Basque countryside, it will take a while for the grain production back to pre-war levels, a situation that is not helped by the influx of republican exiles, French Basque immigrants and refugees from devastated villages. The government has several options to tackle the situation, though each poses its unique drawbacks.\n\n Some have suggested to simply ignore the rumours and wait for them to dispel as the people grow more accustomed to the whole-grain bread, others have recommended starting a propaganda campaign to spread awareness of the situation and why the bread quality has to be different, while yet others suggest simply sourcing more grain from the Reichspakt or Internationale to get the production quality up against.

One of the key ways these villages have recently changed is the dying of the sardinera culture. Sardineras, as they are known in Spanish, were women who would buy fish from the local fishermen of Portugalete, Santurtzi and Getxo, usually that fish being sardines.\n\n Then the women would embark on a 30-40 kilometre journeys on foot to distribute the fish alongside whatever settlements lay between their village of origin and the central city of Bilbao. The fish were stored in large baskets and covered in oil to ensure that they would not spoil over the length of the long journey, and these large baskets would then be carried over the heads of the women. Known for their sharp and loud cries that announced the arrival of fish, the women would be the lifeblood of Basque society until the arrival of trams and trains, leading to a slow decline of the sardinera culture as their backbreaking service was no longer needed.\n\n Their skills would live on as many women traded the fish baskets to cargo pallets, hauling goods and helping with the offloading of ships at Basque ports. However, while the sardineras no longer work in the role they did during the 19th century all the way to the first decades of the current one, their memory remains in the coast. The song Desde Santurce a Bilbao is dedicated to the brave sardinero women of the Basque coast, and despite the disappearance of the trade, the new nation will never forget these folks who once fed the Basque people.

This has led to increased interest in the lives of Basques outside of the cradle of the nation in the Pyrenees, and one particular character has become more talked about given his recent demise. Joaquín Trincado Mateo, a son of Navarre, died recently in 1935, and his remarkable life as a spiritist and philosopher has appealed to the Basques, not necessarily from the spiritual side because of their devout Catholicism, but more on the arduous life that Tricado led to see his vision come true, something the Basques can very much relate to after the recent hardships.\n\n Trincado was the creator of the Escuela Magnetico-Espiritual de la Comuna Universal, a mixture of philosophy, faith and lifestyle, that he founded after a spiritual experience in Jerusalem where Trincado was visiting the Essenes secret society of the Jewish faith. Trincade believed that the spirit was the source of all human wisdom and ingenuity, and it followed the will of Eloí, the universal creator. To Trincado, the unification of all humanity into a one great spiritualist brotherhood, to achieve eternal and continuous life and never-ending progress of human knowledge, was the main goal, and he hoped to achieve this goal through the creation of various institutions and organizations, that would teach his ideals to the people all around the globe, as well as uniting scientists and spiritual guides to unite the knowledge of both sides and help both sides find better answers to questions humanity has.\n\n To achieve this aim, Trincado created the organization Organización Templo Azul Racionalista and its sister organization, Círculo Defensor del Maestro. The most controversial aspect of Trincado to the Basques has always been his Hispanist ideas, as he wanted to increase Hispanic unity, possibly as a prototype of his later goals of a world-spanning brotherhood of peoples. Some famous freedom fighters and politicians around Latin America would adopt ideas of Trincado’s Luz y Verdad manifesto, most importantly Augusto César Sandino, and Trincado’s support to socialist ideals did make his theories a bit more popular among the suffering masses of the Hispanic America. His organizations often spread all across the Hispanic world, from the shores of Argentina to the Philippines, and EMECU for example had established around 180 branches all over the world, most importantly in Latin America and Spain. While Trincado’s Hispanism was not the paternalistic and assimilative ideals of the Spanish government, it has made him somewhat of a controversial figure in Euskal Herria, though the success of his eccentric idealism cannot be understated."

Still, given the barbaric reaction the Spaniards have displayed towards our justified calls for independence, many within the government feel that there needs to be an evacuation of not just Basque people, but of Basque cultural and patriotic heritage. Most of these relics and icons of the cause of Basque independence could be evacuated alongside the people of Euskadi, but some cannot be removed from the nation without great deal of effort.\n\n One such icon is the grave of Sabino Arana, which would undoubtedly be desecrated by the maketos should Euskadi fall, and thus the government considers it prudent to move the earthly remains of Basque nationalism’s father to a safer, more hidden location, possibly in the township of Zalla.

Unlike other theories that mostly examined aspects of Basque language in relation to others, or focused on relatively vague methods such as skull measurement, the recent look into the peculiarities of Basque blood instead focused on the unique properties of it. Basques possess an unique blood type composition among the population, as a very large section of the population has O negative blood type, to such a degree that similar properties have not been observed anywhere else. \n\nThis in combination to the peculiarities of the Basque physique, the expectation that Basques have lived in the Pyrenees as far back as twelve thousand years ago and the fact that Basques possess a language unlike any other, has led scientists to speculate that the Basques are in fact small surviving pockets of the Cro Magnon people, classified by paleontologist Louis Lartet in 1868 following a find in Les Eyzies in France. It is believed that the relative isolation and fierce resistance that the Basques had for the invading Indo-European people explains why these small enclaves managed to survive to the modern day, though obviously much more studies and scientific research must be done to fully pin-point whether this study is truly concretely found in facts or simply another crackpot theory to explain the uniqueness of Basques.\n\n Reactions to the study have been mixed, with some Basques celebrating this discovery as a true new step towards fully understanding the people’s unique past. Others see it as slanderous to the nation. Perhaps the most interesting has been the Spanish reactions, however, as the Spaniards squabble among themselves whether this study is accurate or not. Some, enraged by the victory of the Basque independence war, claim it is a sign that the Basques are inferior to Hispanic people and of a more primitive sort, while Hispano-supremacists who still seek to retake Euskal Herria claim the study to be a hoax aimed at dismantling Iberian Hispanic unity which includes the Basques just as much as it does Galicians and Catalans too."

Steer came to Euskal Herria during the initial phase of the war, and he would come to cover the battles of Gernika, Vittoria and the siege of Bilbao.\n\n Steer wrote scathing reports of the Spanish tactics, especially the indiscriminate attacks on civilians and bombing campaigns on Euskadi’s cities. His coverage of the war eventually earned Steer a death warrant from the invading Spaniards, and the journalist adopted a habit of carrying a Astra machine pistol with him at all times, though like the many Basque troops he covered, the journalist did not know how to operate the weapon and thankfully, never had the necessity of using it.\n\n Steer’s experiences and reports have been relatively popular in the Internationale, and they’ve garnered a great deal of support even beyond his nation of origin. Non-Basque reporters like him continue the great work in legitimizing the actions of the Basque government, even if the nation may be ideologically different from the Internationale. Steer has since returned to Britain, bidding farewell to his companions in Euskadi, but his work continues to further the cause of Euskadi and her people to this day."

BAS.342.t:0 "The Revolver Craze"
BAS.342.d:0 "When the Spanish army invaded Euskadi, much of the new Eusko Gudarostea was made up of untrained, inexperienced volunteers who had not held a weapon, much less fired one, ever in their lives. The volunteers were given old bolt-action rifles scavenged from Guardia Civil depots, and sometimes the men carried little more than five rounds of ammunition. However, as weapon shipments came in from nations such as Commune of France and Ireland, a curious and somewhat unfortunate craze set in with the Basque soldiers. These Gudaris, having grown up with American Hollywood movies with dashing cowboys and their faithful six-shot big irons, were completely convinced that the French Model 1892, Webley and Nagant revolvers shipped in overseas were the best weapons in the world, completely misunderstanding that these guns would be pitiful against the machine guns and rifles of the Spaniards.\n\n This revolver craze would see Basque ‘cowboys’ going into battle in wool shirts, brandishing little more than handguns, leading to multiple skirmish-level defeats as these youthful but naive militias would be slaughtered by the merciless Spaniards. While the situation was rectified later following thorough training exercises done to future conscripts, emphasizing the intended tasks of different weapons, this episode with foreign revolvers shows just how unprepared Euskadi was to the horrors of war, and to the newly reformed Eusko Gudarostea, it remains a grim warning of how one must know their tools before setting off to fight for their lives."

BAS.343.t:0 "The Life-Long Liberal of the Generation of ‘98"
BAS.343.d:0 "The Kingdom of Spain, in its ignorance, has fallen further and further into destruction and despair, forgetting all the lessons learned of democracy during the Second Spanish Republic. But many republicans, in their plight of exile, have seen the example of the independent Basque republic shine bright, and have set sail to our shores. Among these many republicans was a man of Basque origins yet known for his Hispanist tendencies, Miguel de Unamuno, arguably the greatest mind of the literature generation of ‘98 and the man of immense productivity and talent in the field of prose and poetry.\n\n Unamuno was originally supportive of the 1932 coup in Spain, seeing it as a necessary step towards alleviating the chaos in Spain, but the restoration of the monarchy and the lack of a return to a more liberal rule turned the man against Sanjurjo’s new regime, and Unamuno himself soon went into exile in Venezuela alongside other artists and writers from the republican side. He has always been proud of his Basque roots, despite advocating for the use of Spanish instead of Euskara and the continued existence of Euskal Herria within the greater Spanish state. Unamuno has returned to his birth city of Bilbao alongside other republican figures, and despite his former resistance to Basque nationalism, he has seemingly been open to collaborating with local political forces mostly out of the vain hope that the Basque republic will keep the dream of a Spanish republic alive.\n\n Unamuno himself has been one of the strongest voices of Spanish liberalism, but in his old age said idealism has been  slowly dying off. However, the failures of the Acción Popular regime in Spain seems to have made him drift back to his earlier positions, and despite his advanced age, he has been a strong supporter of Basque republic in its new form. While Unamuno has not taken part in politics, and his earlier statements on Basque nationalism has made many within the republic wary of him, the University of Deusto has allowed him to work there as a lecturer for the time being. Some hope that he could be turned towards Basque nationalism, but few actually expect such a turn, especially as the man’s age creeps up on him."

BAS.344.t:0 "The Basque National Sport"
BAS.344.d:0 "The Basque sport of pelota has always been a staple of Northern Iberian sports, with strong player bases in Euskal Herria, Iparralde, Navarra and La Rioja, but given the nature of Basque population overseas, it has gained large amount of support in South American nations, especially Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. Pelota is traditionally played either between two people, where a wall serves as the target, or in pairs, where the two opposing sides are separated by a net or a drawn line.\n\n The game is played by bouncing the ball, known as pilota, off the frontoi playing area with the intention of making it bounce off the floor in a way that the opposing team cannot stop it from hitting the floor more than once. The sport has multiple different variations based on whether it is played with a leather racket, a hand or with different types of ball or wall arrangements, and depending on the nationality of the players, the combination of these different factors is chosen depending on their preference. Obviously given the versatility of factors and variations, every nation has their set of purists who claim to have the best set of factors in their form of pelota.\n\n However, as Euskadi, the birthplace of the sport, is now free, the International Federation of Pelota founded in 1929 in Argentina has planned to move their headquarters to either Bilbao or Donostia. The symbolic change would be a drastic one as much of the players of the sport are in South America, but many hope that it would give more recognition to the new nation and forge stronger ties with the Basques. Similarly, given that Euskadi is the only nation in the world with pelota as the national sport, it makes the most sense to lead the sport’s recognition. Despite the troubles in Europe, many wish that one day, pelota could appear as an Olympic sport, as it has appeared in them in 1900 as an actual one and in 1924 as a feature sport, though for the time being the more likely option would be to organize a world championship tournament of pelota. This may very well become reality once the Basque reconstruction process is complete."

BAS.345.t:0 "The Pastoralist Arts"
BAS.345.d:0 "The rural art of the pastorals, or Basque folk theatre, has seen a degree of revival in Euskadi following the independence from Spain, as people have come from all the seven provinces of Euskal Herria and Iparralde to celebrate every aspect of Basque culture. Pastorals are an ancient tradition of the Pyrenean people, featuring two sides, the türkak or satanak, literally meaning Turkish or Demons, and the righteous and just kiristinak or Christians. The two sides are dressed respectively in red and blue to denote their role, and the steps and stances of the performance are predetermined on every new story. During the dance and play, the actors recite their lines in Zuberoan dialect of Euskara, and the performance may even involve choral performances where the audience is expected to become involved in it as well.\n\n These performances are usually supported by music from traditional Basque instruments like xirula and ttun-ttun. The subjects of these plays varies from one creation to the next, but the central similarity is always the tone, as these pastorals are always tragedies, not comedies, and more often than not, the protagonist is a hero of great significance to Basque history or mythos. The traditional norm has been that women do not participate in the pastorals as actors, only in musical roles, but with the advent of Basque independence and increased role of women in Basque society, this has been questioned, and there has been a slight controversy within the community of pastoralists as more and more women demand to be included in the performances as actors. Roles for women have always been a part of the pastorals, but they’ve been played by men up until now, and many conservatives within the scene demand this tradition to continue."

BAS.347.t:0 "Shanghai, Basque Hero"
BAS.347.d:0 "The Basque cause for independence has resonated with many a man and woman across the globe, and even Spaniards have joined our fight against their own government out of shared hatred for the Madrid regime. Volunteers from Internationale have been the largest group to support our regime, but Germans, Austrians, Latin Americans, Italians, Irish and even Russians have made up a fair bit of the volunteer forces as well. Some, however, have come from even further away, with a volunteer named Aking Chan hailing all the way from the oriental shores of Shanghai to fight in the Basque war. Chan was not a stranger to nationalist causes even in China, where he had supported the Kuomintang rebels against the warlords and the imperialist Legation Cities, an alignment that eventually drove him to exile when local police caught his trail. Travelling to Europe by a ship to join the exiled Chinese syndicalists in France, he heard of the Basque uprising from a Vietnamese cook on the ship and diverted his trajectory to Bilbao. Chan was willing to fight alongside other Internationale volunteers mostly to see yet another imperialist crumble, but while fighting as part of the Eusko Gudarostea, he developed a friendship with local fighter Luis Ariznabarreta and became more sympathetic to the Basque cause as a whole. The Chinese man did not speak Basque and could only communicate with gestures, expressions and body language, but apparently he was so convinced to fight that despite the communication barrier, ‘Shanghai’ as he became known as, became a soldier in the Basque provisional army. Following the chaos of the war and its aftermath, it was not known where Chan ended up, but his legacy remains in the men he fought alongside with, and they continue to hope that the strange Chinese volunteer made it to France after the war."

BAS.348.t:0 "The Enigma of Basque Democracy"
BAS.348.d:0 "The Basque transition to democracy has been heavily observed by international actors, especially those from the Internationale, Reichspakt and Entente, who are curious to see how a new nation breaking away from a nation such as Spain, with its long history of authoritarianism, can navigate the pitfalls of democratic process. This has been a common talking point in Euskadi as well, given the inclusion of socialists from Eusko Alderdi Sozialista and traditionalists from Eusko Alderdi Aberri into the democratic elections, and recently, a known Basque writer and cleric José de Ariztimuño Olaso, better known as Aitzol, has dedicated an entire book on the peculiarities of Basque democracy and why, in his eyes, it just works. The book La democracia en Euzkadi, written in Spanish to reach a wider audience despite Aitzol’s nationalist tendencies, has become a hit among international observers and local politicians alike, as it explains the long tradition of Basque democracy and political inclusion, dating back to the Fueros and its modernized form today. Aitzol has a long history of covering politics and democratic processes in his writing, as he has been a strong supporter of non-socialist labour movements, Christian democracy and Basque nationalism for decades, and has been a large figure within Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea. While the book itself covers mostly the political aspects of Euskal Herria, Aitzol has other projects related to the spiritual and cultural life of the nation, and he publishes the bilingual newspaper El Día de San Sebastián. He is particularly strong supporter of Basque theatre and the bertsolari tradition, and as his international prospects are improving thanks to the release of his latest books, some within EAJ have supported him in pursuing a more distinct role as Basque cultural ambassador even overseas."

BAS.349.t:0 "Asociación de Muchachas Guías"
BAS.349.d:0 "The history of Scouts in Euskal Herria is not a long nor detailed one, but they have had a certain degree of presence in the region since the founding of Exploradores de España in 1912 by the cavalry captain Teodoro Iradier y Herrero. Compared to Catalonia, Iradier’s main region of Exploradores promotion, the movement didn’t get particularly far until the founding of Asociación de Muchachas Guías by the Bilbaoan social activist María Abrisqueta de Zulueta. Her strong drive to see this organization thrive bore success, as the group was aimed at gathering support from Basque girls, and AMG would see stellar growth over the years, and its branches reached Barcelona, Zaragoza and Valladolid in addition to the headquarters in Donostia. This led to increased support for Abrisqueta, and she was planned to become the national head of the scouting organizations but in a shock event, she stepped down from the head of AMG in 1935, and later it was revealed that she was planning to leave Spain altogether as her husband Julián Zulueta Bessón was a prominent Cuban businessman. AMG was mostly left bereft of actual leadership and its support declined in Euskal Herria, especially following the war against Spain, but given that it is far more tied to the movement started by Agnes Baden-Powell, Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powell’s sister, and not to the Hispanist regime in Madrid, it has not been outright banned in Euskadi. The numerous women’s organizations ranging from the Eusko Emakume Ekintza and Emakume Abertzale Batza to the Carlist Margaritas have sought to absorb the organization, but so far it has been largely independent. However, unless the movement can truly reform itself to adapt to a more Basque identity, this footnote in Iberian Scouts history may fade to the point of oblivion."

BAS.352.t:0 "Askatasunera"
BAS.352.d:0 "As Basque musicians and bertsolaris have spread their influence further and further into the world, they’ve started to collaborate more intensely with other language minorities of Europe, beyond just the traditional allies of Catalonia and Galicia. A curious case has been observed in the island of Corsica, where a group of Basque musicians, led by the famous Etxahun Iruri, a known revivalist of the Basque folk song tradition, happened into during a tour of Europe. The island, having been the closest point to the French mainland after the Communard revolution, has seen the Nationalist remnants in Algiers hold onto it with an iron grip. Most notoriously this has been seen in the suppression of any socialist or even simply regionalist movements, and thus it was quite the miracle that the Basques were allowed to visit the local taverns and cultural houses in the first place.\n\n While nationalism in Corsica barely exists, they have always suffered under the French linguistic practices, and the Partitu Corsu d'Azione, led by one of the few actual Corsican seekers of independence, Petru Rocca, have worked underground to preserve the culture and language of Corsica despite the efforts of the French nationalists to root them out. Recently, Iruri came into contact with a group of these nationalists, and following a long evening of stories from the Basque struggle for independence and the creation of an independent state of Euskadi, the Corsicans wanted to Iruri to help them spread awareness of the Corse situation. Being a musician by trade, the Iruri’s group soon set to work on composing and creating the lyrics for a song that would help spread the cause of Corsica, and the solidarity song was fittingly sung in both Basque and Corsican languages.\n\n Named Askatasunera, or To Freedom, the song details the struggles of both nations to achieve recognition within a larger, dominant and culturally different entity, but the tone of the song, while at parts somber, is also hopeful that just like the Basques have, the Corsican people will one day breath free. This has, overwhelmingly, been the mood of the entire visit to the island for our delegation, as they depart hoping that perhaps the coming years will bring freedom to this newfound companion in anti-imperialist fight."

BAS.356.t:0 "Food Shortages"
BAS.356.d:0 "The Basque provisional government had prepared for the war against the Spanish kingdom secretly for years, but the sheer size of refugees and exiles flooding into our nation has made any prior plans related to feeding the populace of Euskadi completely useless. With so many mouths to feed and supply routes to Castilian, Manchegan and Andalusian grain cut off, the Bilbao government is facing a food crisis of unprecedented magnitude. The nature of Basque geography makes mass farming such as the latifundios present in the south completely unviable here, and the small farms most Basques substitute off are not big or productive enough to feed all the new mouths huddling for support in our cities.\n\n Nationalists like Luis Arana call for us to kick out these maketos, but this would only sour our international reputation. Supporters of Arana claim that we should simply do our best to win the war and stabilize the situation that way, enduring some harsh months of shortages in order to fund the war machine, while maintaining a degree of rationing. Moderate conservatives from the ruling party Eusko Alderdi Jeltzale claim that we should purchase some produce from friendly nations, such as the Internationale and Mexico, and ration whatever we have in the warehouses and silos. The socialists of Eusko Alderdi Sozialista and progressives of Eusko Abertzale Ekintza on the other hand have suggested bringing in bulk supplies of cheap foods, such as the Mexican chickpeas, which we can use as a temporary measure to combat food shortages. It is however hated by the population, who call it the Yellow Menace, and likely would still encourage social unrest, but at the very least it would keep our people fed. This solution is costly, however, and importing food will take away from our ability to fund weapons and ammunition."

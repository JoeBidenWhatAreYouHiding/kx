POLITICS_KARL_DESC:0 "After his uncle Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914, Karl von Habsburg-Lothringen became the designated successor of Kaiser Franz Josef, upon whose death Karl inherited the many thrones of the Habsburg Empire in late 1916. In spite of victory in the Weltkrieg, Austria remained burdened by an archaic political system and unrest. Emperor Karl now has the arduous task of reforming the ailing Empire despite numerous internal and external threats."
POLITICS_OTTO_DESC:0 "Emperor Otto von Habsburg-Lothringen has succeeded his father, Karl, as monarch of Austria. Otto, despite his young age, has grand ambitions of an Empire whose disparate peoples share but one national identity. His laconic speech and youthful charm have culminated in Otto garnering frequent media attention."

AUS_ARCHDUKE_EUGEN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L May 21, 1863, in Gross-Seelowitz, Moravia, Austrian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L Grandson of the \"Hero of Aspern\", Archduke Karl, Eugen entered the military at the tender age of 14 as part of the elite Kaiserjäger Regiment. In 1885, he would become the first Archduke to receive a formal education at the Theresian Military Academy and became a fully-trained general staff officer that year. In 1887, he became a knight of the Teutonic Order, and as he rose through the ranks of the Austro-Hungarian Army, he succeeded his uncle as \"Hoch- und Deutschmeister\" (Grandmaster) of the Knights in 1894, a duty he has taken very seriously ever since. He was made General of Cavalry in 1901, but retired from active duty ten years later for health reasons.\nEugen immediately reported for active duty at the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, but was not considered for any field command until he succeeded Oskar Potiorek as commander of the Serbian Front in December. He and his chief of staff, Alfred Krauss, thoroughly reorganised his forces, horribly battered from the unparalleled incompetence of his predecessor, and made them ready for the successful Central Powers invasion of Serbia the next year. However, before that, Eugen was promoted to Colonel General and transferred to command the Italian Front. With the successful defence against the treacherous Italians and active presence on the front, the Archduke became very popular among his subordinates and troops. He became a field marshal in November 1916 and would be one of the main commanders during the Caporetto Offensive the following March. Nevertheless, he retired from active service in January 1918 as the Emperor himself took overall command of Austro-Hungarian forces.\nSince then, Archduke Eugen has had a limited role in military affairs as he approaches full retirement, using his position to influence personnel decisions, ensuring the wellbeing of troops and veterans, and otherwise focusing on his duties as Grandmaster of the Teutonic Knights."
AUS_ARCHDUKE_JOSEPH_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L August 9, 1872, in Alcsút, Hungary, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Titular Palatine of Hungary, Archduke Joseph August is the scion of the so-called Hungarian branch of the Imperial and Royal family, being born and raised in that half of the Monarchy. As expected of an Archduke, he started his military career at a young age in 1890. Unlike his kinsmen, however, he transferred to the Royal Hungarian Honvéd in 1902 when he rose to the rank of Major, with his sympathies and identity clearly laying with the Kingdom of Hungary.\nBy the start of the Weltkrieg, Archduke Joseph had already proven himself to be a talented officer, having been promoted to Major General in 1908, and Lieutenant Field Marshal (Lieutenant General) in 1911. In the opening stages of the war, the Archduke quickly proved his competence once his division was rushed from the Serbian to the Russian Front, successfully covering the retreat of the 2nd Army before fighting in the ill-fated winter fighting in the Carpathians, which failed to relieve Przemysl but did stop the Russians from invading Hungary. In May 1915, commanding the VII Corps, Archduke Joseph commanded the southern portion of the Isonzo Front, taking the brunt of numerous Italian offensives. There, he proved his personal bravery and leadership, commanding at the front where he was wounded twice and becoming the only senior commander to receive the Karl Troop Cross for twelve weeks of frontline service. He would remain on the Italian Front until December 1916, after which he was transferred to the Romanian Front for all of 1917. He returned to the Italian Front in July 1918 to take command of Armeegruppe Tirol, where he would defeat Italy’s final offensive of the war in October, soon being promoted to Field Marshal.\nAfter the war, he stayed with the army, remaining well-loved and respected, but increasingly became involved in political and, especially, academic circles in Hungary. For much of the troubled years since the Weltkrieg, Joseph August remains a connecting symbol between the Monarchy and Hungary."
AUS_ALFRED_JANSA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L July 16, 1884, in Stanislau, Galicia, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Hailing from a military family, Alfred Jansa graduated from the Kriegsschule in Vienna in November 1912 and was commissioned a Captain in the staff of the Governor of Bosnia, Oskar Potiorek. Two years later, in Sarajevo, he would witness the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the start of the Weltkrieg.\nJansa would end up serving on nearly all fronts; from 1915 onward, he was a liaison officer, serving with distinction in the staff of famous German generals as Mackensen, Seeckt, and Below.\nAt the war's end, he was promoted to general, continuing his staff work up the chain of command. For most of the '30s, he was the military attaché to Berlin, where his connections in the German general staff from the Weltkrieg proved invaluable. As it stands, Jansa is an energetic reformer with great respect for his German counterparts, but he has been outspoken on Austria-Hungary's need to maintain the independence of its military."
AUS_ERHARD_RAUS_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L January 8, 1889, in Wolframitz, Moravia, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Graduating from a cadet school near Brno, Raus joined a Feldjäger (light infantry) battalion when he was 18 years old. He spent most of the Weltkrieg on the Eastern Front, distinguishing himself as the commander of a bicycle company. After the war, he was promoted to Colonel in the general staff, teaching infantry tactics. With experience with mobile warfare during the Weltkrieg, he was eventually transferred to the Fast Division's cycling battalion. His promotion to General is very recent, making Raus still unproven as a field commander, but he is already proving to be naturally talented with armoured warfare."
AUS_LOTHAR_RENDULIC_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L October 25, 1887, in Wiener Neustadt, Lower Austria, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Son of an officer of Croatian origin, Rendulic first studied law before enrolling at the Theresian Military Academy. In 1910, he was commissioned Lieutenant, and fought in Galica for the first years of the Weltkrieg. At the war's end, he was a Captain in the general staff as part of XXI Corps on the Italian front.\nAfter the war, he finished his law studies before rising further up the ranks as part of the War Ministry.In 1934, after being promoted to Major General, he took command of Austria-Hungary's first mechanised unit, the Fast Division.\nDespite a respectable career at the War Ministry and commander of the Fast Division, his experience is still lacking as a relatively recent promotion, while his loyalties may be dubious with ties to German nationalist organisations."
AUS_KARL_EGLSEER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L July 5, 1890, in Bad Ischl, Upper Austria, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L After graduating from the Infantry Cadet School in Marburg (Maribor), he joined the 87th Infantry Regiment in 1908 as an officer cadet, receiving his commission as Lieutenant in 1911. When the Weltkrieg began, Eglseer was sent to the front and by September 1914, he was wounded for the first time. He was sent back to the front that December, only to be seriously wounded again on Christmas Eve. This time, he was captured by the Russians and would remain in captivity until March 1918. He was promoted to Captain on his return and served with distinction on the Italian Front in time for Italy's final offensive and the Austro-Hungarian one that finally brought victory over the Italians in 1919.\nHaving spent most of the war as a prisoner of war, Eglseer's career moved up slowly and he remains one of the less experienced members of the general staff."
AUS_JULIUS_RINGEL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L November 16, 1889, in Völkermarkt, Carinthia, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L \"Papa\" Ringel entered the Austrian Landwehr as an ensign in 1909 after attending the Landwehr Cadet School. From the start of his career, he was involved in mountain warfare, first as part of the 4th Landwehr Regiment, then to the 2nd Mountain Rifles Regiment by the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Initially, he participated in the fighting in Galicia before being transferred to the Alps against the Italian invaders. By the end of the war, he was a highly-decorated Captain, soon promoted to Major as he stayed in the Landwehr after the war. He was further promoted after attending a general staff course.\nIt is worth noting that Ringel is heavily involved in German nationalist organisations, maintaining a fairly anti-slav attitude and refusing any post in the Common Army."
AUS_FRANZ_BOEHME_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L April 15, 1885, in Zeltweg, Styria, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Böhme joined the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1900 and was commissioned a lieutenant five years later. A year into the Weltkrieg, he was made Captain after serving with distinction in the ferocious fighting in Galicia. Böhme would continue to serve all over the Eastern Front under German Command. By the time he was transferred to the Western Front as part of the Austro-Hungarian force there, he had fought from Tarnopol in Galicia up to Dvinsk in the Baltic region. After the war, Böhme slowly rose through the ranks, briefly working for the Evidenzbureau in the field of military intelligence.\nHis membership in German nationalist organisations has brought doubts about his loyalty to the Monarchy."
AUS_SIGISMUND_SCHILHAWSKY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L April 7, 1881, in Budapest, Hungary, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Scion of a German-Bohemian military family, \"Zsiga\" Schilhawsky is the youngest of three sons (incidentally all generals) of Feldzeugmeister (General of Artillery) Joseph Schillhawsky. Sigismund graduated from the Theresian Military Academy in 1901, becoming a general staff officer. In 1912, he was part of the staff of the Austrian Landwehr before transferring to the XV Corps at the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. After serving as chief of staff of the 14th Infantry Division from October 1915 to April 1917, he was transferred to the Armeeoberkommando’s (Army High Command) operations department, where he helped plan for the Caporetto offensive, then the final Austro-Hungarian offensive of the war.\nA proven administrator and planner, Schilhawsky was made Major General soon after the war, then General of Infantry."
AUS_EDUARD_BARGER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§LSeptember 6, 1882, in Leitmeritz, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career: §LAt the start of the Weltkrieg, Barger was a captain, leading a company. His wartime is nothing short of exemplary: Wounded four times, he became known for his initiative, leadership, and personal bravery. He fought in the awful conditions of the Winter campaign in the Carpathians, then in the Alps against the Italians. In the final stages of the war, he led a Czech regiment on the fierce fighting on the Asiago Plateau, reinforcing his belief in the Monarchy as his troops, despite the false rumours of their supposed unreliability, fought bravely. After the war, Barger slowly rose through the ranks, becoming a general in 1935.\nWhile his personal courage and impressive frontline leadership is impossible to overstate, the truth is that he has no experience in leading units bigger than a regiment."
AUS_FRIEDRICH_MATERNA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L June 21, 1885, in Hof, Moravia, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Materna entered the Austro-Hungarian Army as an ensign in 1904. In 1913, he graduated from the Kriegsschule in Vienna, serving as a general staff officer in Galicia for the first years of the war. After 1917, he was a staff officer under Archduke Eugen, finishing the war as a Lieutenant Colonel. After the war, a staff officer through and through, he was quickly promoted to Colonel, then Major General as a member of the military inspectorate.\nWith most of his experience from being a staff officer and heading the recruitment and training department of the War Ministry, his skill as a field commander remains definitely unproven."
AUS_WILHELM_ZEHNER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L September 2, 1883, in Bistritz, Hungary, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Coming from a Protestant family, Zehner joined the Austro-Hungarian Army as a Lieutenant in 1903. During training, he proved to be very capable and a skilled marksman. During the yearly manoeuvres in 1912, he received a commendation from his commanding officer. At the start of the Weltkrieg, Zehner was the intendant (administrator for supplies outside of weapons and ammunition) of XVI Corps, with the outbreak of the war moving him to the administration of the 1th Mountain Brigade on the Serbian Front. In December 1916, after requesting a transfer to frontline service, he was promoted to Captain, commanding the 7th battalion of the 64rd Regiment. After serving on the Romanian Front for most of 1917 and early 1918, his battalion fought against Red Guards as the Austro-Hungarian Army advanced into Ukraine, distinguishing itself during the bitter street fighting for the capture of Mykolaiv. In April 1918, he took command of Assault Battalion 59, spending the rest of the war in Ukraine, fighting more Red Guards and taking care of border security. At the end of the war, he was highly decorated and respected, his troops calling him “Iron Zehner”. After the war, Zehner took staff officer courses and rapidly rose through the ranks. An enthusiastic moderniser and already a proven military administrator and by 1934, he was a General of Infantry, serving in the War Ministry’s personnel department for several years."
AUS_LUDWIG_VON_EIMANNSBERGER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L November 19, 1878, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Son of a career officer killed during the Occupation of Bosnia, Eimannsberger was raised by his mother, also from a military family, in a Spartan lifestyle. At the tender age of 10, he was sent to a military school before proceeding for the ancient and prestigious Technical Military Academy, graduating in 1899 as an artillery officer. In 1905, he finished his studies at the Kriegsschule and became a staff officer.\nBy 1914, he had spent a few years teaching at the Technical Military Academy before transferring to the XII Corps when the war broke out. Until 1916, he fought in Galicia before becoming artillery commander of the Kaiserschützen (mountain infantry) Division in South Tyrol. His role during the breakthrough at Caporetto in 1917 earned him the Order of Leopold. By the end of the Weltkrieg, he was a Colonel.\nDuring the Interwar, Eimannsberger became fascinated with one of the newest weapons of war, tanks. In 1926, he became head of the Military Technical Committee and was promoted to Feldzeugmeister (General of Artillery) the next year. In 1934, he published "Der Kampfwagenkrieg" (Tank War), a thorough analysis of the use of tanks during the Weltkrieg and their growing importance. While he is seen as a visionary, he has been fighting an uphill battle against traditionalists in the general staff and crippling underfunding. Nevertheless, he has been able to secure the creation of a modern mechanised division based on his theories. Time will tell if the tank proves to be the revolutionary weapon of the future.\n\n§L\"Horsemen are dead, there is no place for them next to tanks. While their tasks remain, they will be solved by assigning tank squadrons in the future!\"\n\n\"Attack is firepower and mobility, and these two elements are combined into a single weapon in the tank.\""
AUS_MIKLOS_HORTHY_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\nBorn:§L June 18, 1868, in Kenderes, Hungary, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L At age 14, Horthy entered the Naval Academy in Fiume (Rijeka), receiving the rank of Frigate Lieutenant in 1896, marking the beginning of his long career as a naval officer. Expectedly, he travelled around the world as he rose through the ranks. Notably, he became aide-de-camp to Emperor Franz Joseph, additionally advising the monarch in Hungarian affairs, from 1909 to 1914. Horthy viewed the old Emperor in very high regards and he often reminisced fondly about his time as an advisor.\nWhen the Weltkrieg began, Horthy commanded the pre-dreadnought SMS Habsburg before taking command of the cruiser SMS Novarra, where he would cement his reputation as a bold commander. In 1917, he planned and led the Battle of the Strait of Otranto, where he led his fleet of cruisers and destroyers to victory despite being seriously wounded to the point of losing consciousness. The following year saw a meteoric rise through the ranks, becoming a Rear Admiral and Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet in February 1918, Vice Admiral in October, and full Admiral in 1919 after scoring another victory against the Entente forces in the Mediterranean.\nAfter the war, Horthy was Hungary’s most prominent and popular national hero and he continued his career in the Navy. He became Grand Admiral, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and Chief of the Naval Section at the War Ministry in the 1920s, ensuring that, despite tightening purse-strings, the Kriegsmarine continued to receive sufficient funding and the naval industry remained employed. With the economy in shambles, however, it has become increasingly difficult to secure funds for the Navy, but his popularity and diligence ensures that the oft-forgotten branch does not fall to disrepair."
AUS_GEORG_VON_TRAPP_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\nBorn:§L April 4, 1880, in Zara, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L In 1894, Trapp entered the Naval Academy in Fiume (Rijeka), following in his father’s footsteps. He was assigned to SMS Zenta in 1900, participating in the Battle of Taku Forts during the Boxer Rebellion. Three years later, he was commissioned a Frigate Lieutenant. Fascinated by submarines, he requested to be transferred to the U-boot-Waffe, the new submarine arm of the navy, in 1908.\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he began his storied career as a U-Boat commander with the SM U-5, sinking two enemy warships in nine combat patrols in 1915. By August, he was already hailed as a hero across the Empire. Later that year, he took command of SM U-14 (formerly French submarine Curie). By the end of the war, Trapp had been promoted to Corvette Captain, having been through nineteen combat patrols, two warships sunk, and over 45 000 tonnage at the bottom of the sea.\nAfter the war, Trapp stayed in the Navy, eventually becoming commander of the submarine fleet as a Rear Admiral. Unsurprisingly, he has been the number one advocate for the expansion and modernisation of the U-Boat fleet, which he sees as the Monarchy’s most important weapon, able to fight its enemies even if the Adriatic is bottled up.\nOn a more peaceful note, he and the rest of his musically-talented family have recently been performing as a singing troupe for church service and festivals."
AUS_HEINRICH_PERGLER_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\nBorn:§L March 26, 1871, in Budweis, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Pergler entered the Naval Academy in Fiume (Rijeka) in 1886, joining the Austro-Hungarian Navy after graduating in 1890. His first command was a torpedo boat in 1900, but by 1914, he commanded the cruiser SMS Panther. As captain of the Panther, he helped the Army repel the Montenegrin Army from the port and naval base in Cattaro (Kotor). After being promoted to chief of staff of the Second Division, he commanded a pre-dreadnought before becoming captain of the dreadnought SMS Tegetthoff. It was with the Tegetthoff that Pergler participated in the Second Battle of Otranto, which saw the sinking of its sister ship SMS Szent István. In January 1919, he was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral. Much of his time after the Weltkrieg was spent on the Austrian Navy Association (Marineverband), promoting the Navy's wartime achievements, its geopolitical and economic importance, and lionising its heroes."
AUS_ARCHDUKE_MAX_EUGEN_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\nBorn:§L April 13, 1895, in Vienna, Lower-Austria, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Emperor Karl's younger brother was merely 19 when the Weltkrieg began and was serving his initial military service expected of a young archduke. With the privilege of his position, he quickly rose to the rank of Major, and he showed tactical acumen and bravery: During the assault on Dosso Alto in June 1918, he was wounded in action when a shell exploded near him, partially deafening him. Two months later, he transferred to the navy and became commander of the U-Bootsuchflottille (anti-submarine flotilla). From then on, Maximilian Eugen took the mantle as the patron of the Kriegsmarine within the Imperial and Royal family, a duty formerly taken by two kinsmen that met tragic ends: Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, along with the less tragic Archduke Stephen, a major candidate to the Polish throne."

AUS_russian_threat_desc:0 "The Great Russian Bear has reared its head in the east again, and threatens to not only retake all the land it lost during the Weltkrieg, but also to march into Germany itself. There is little doubt that, should Russia succeed in its aims, there will eventually turn their attention to us as well. It appears we must wade into the Eastern front once more, whether we like it or not."

### Focuses ###
AUS_eco_council:0 "Economic Rehabilitation Plan"
AUS_eco_council_desc:0 "Established in 1935 during a conference to discuss the sluggish state of the Austrian industry, the Economic Rehabilitation Plan had to be put on halt due to the ongoing economic crisis. Still, its contents, with slight alterations, describe a good way to combat the disastrous effects of the Black Monday crash and to strengthen Austrian industry, now bereft of their main competitor."

AUS_skoda:0 "Škoda"
AUS_skoda_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Škoda Works to the west of Prague was our biggest arms producer, but has fallen on hard times with the overbearing power of German industries. With Germany rocked to the core by Black Monday, subsidies for Škoda is a large step in repairing our economy."

AUS_daimler:0 "Austro Daimler"
AUS_daimler_desc:0 "The Austro Daimler company made us many armoured vehicles and engines for our war effort. German cars and engines have flooded the market in the last decades, but with Porsche teetering on the verge of bankruptcy and Mercedes-Benz looking to follow suit, it is time to breathe new life into our automotive industry^."

AUS_vienna_circle_1:0 "Institutionalise the Vienna Circle"
AUS_vienna_circle_1_desc:0 "The Vienna Circle is a gathering of the brightest minds of the University of Vienna, brilliant mathematicians, philosophers, natural scientists who are at the forefront of scientific and philosophic research. We will make government funds available to them, but also move their work to new, more practical fields."

AUS_vienna_circle_2:0 "Invite Others to Join the Vienna Circle"
AUS_vienna_circle_2_desc:0 "With the Vienna Circle being well-established, funded, and gaining international recognition, the next step is to invite foreign countries with ties to the crown to take part in the research conducted there."

AUS_suedbahn:0 "Electrifying the Südbahn"
AUS_suedbahn_desc:0 "The Südbahn, or Southern Railway, is a railroad that runs from Vienna over Graz to Laibach and Triest, the main seaport of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and finally Milano. Though still a major line of transportation, it was built from 1836 to 1860, so the tracks are in dire need of modernisation. Electrifying the connection would go over relatively swiftly, and help a lot with that."

AUS_homeland_eco:0 "Austrian Civilian Economy"
AUS_homeland_eco_desc:0 "Our already weak economy was reduced to tatters by the Black Monday crash, and the shock can be felt strongly in and around Vienna, but especially in the heavily industrialised Bohemia. Despite our neighbours suffering a similar fate, they already start recovering and outproducing us, so we must enhance our own economy through subsides for key automotive and electrical companies in order to better compete."

AUS_alpine_mines:0 "Alpine Mines"
AUS_alpine_mines_desc:0 "The Alps have always been a rich mineral resource, but until now we had no idea true extend of the wealth we have been sitting on. Huge amounts of iron ore are being taken from our previous mines and new mines are springing up daily. Subsidising or partially nationalising these industries would greatly increase our economic independence."

AUS_homeland_mil:0 "Austrian Military Economy"
AUS_homeland_mil_desc:0 "The Austrian Army has always suffered from mismanagement and poor equipment, but in this day and age that is something we can no longer accept. Threats from Hungarian 'liberalists' and the nearby syndicalist nations that have vowed for our destruction are growing daily, so we must properly arm our brave soldiers in order to survive."

AUS_airbase_expansion:0 "Expand the Austrian Airbases"
AUS_airbase_expansion_desc:0 "The new technology of longer range monoplanes gives us great opportunities, both military and economic. If used as bases for the Fliegerkorps, it will allow us to gain aerial superiority without losing thousands of men. It can also be used to flying in new products and stimulate local economies."

AUS_istria_ports:0 "Ports of Istria"
AUS_istria_ports_desc:0 "Triest and Pflaum are our two principal naval bases, and are vitally important for our overseas trade. The navy, traditionally ignored by successive emperors, has begged us to increase the spending on industrial works and naval bases in Istria, and, swayed by their arguments about increased trade revenue, this emperor has listened."

AUS_farms_expand:0 "Expand Domestic Farms"
AUS_farms_expand_desc:0 "The fertile plains of Hungary and Lower Austria are covered in fields and farms, growing food to feed our empire. But these regions, particularly Hungary, suffer from less industrial investment and mechanisation. Starting a large scale effort to improve the farming techniques will cost us, but we will be rewarded with young, fit men ready for service."

### Elections of 1936
AUS_elections:0 "General Elections of 1936"
AUS_elections_desc:0 "Elections were held every six years in the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, though since the end of the Weltkrieg, several of these acting periods have been cut short by reform or scandals.\nAustrian politics are dominated by the SDAP, the Social-Democrat Worker's Party, and the CS, the Christian-Socials. Both have different ideas on how to solve the ongoing crisis, but who will win?"

AUS_sdap_industrial_workers_council:0 "Public Welfare Reforms"
AUS_sdap_industrial_workers_council_desc:0 "The main concern of the SDAP during the election campaign was to see that the Austrian worker lives through the ongoing crisis. They plan to reaffirm the many reforms introduced in conjunction with the CS since the Weltkrieg, and to provide pension for all those who have lost their jobs."

AUS_sdap_1:0 "Schools, Hospitals, and Parks"
AUS_sdap_1_desc:0 "Building new things is a great way to create short-term jobs. What is more, the things being built might end up providing even more jobs, and if it's schools, hospitals and parks, they are for the common good anyways, so apart from government money, there's nothing to lose."

AUS_sdap_2:0 "Naturfreunde"
AUS_sdap_2_desc:0 "Socialist tendencies were always something mostly harboured by city folk - and these city folk have since the dawn of the century found a new pastime: hiking. Many Viennese, many of them partymen, have come to enjoy climbing Austria's innumerable mountains in groups. Bringing hiking clubs to the countryside might help with bringing socialist sympathies to traditionally conservative areas."

AUS_sdap_3:0 "National Broadcasts"
AUS_sdap_3_desc:0 "Delivering concise and neutral news to the many remote regions of Austria has always been a bit of a problem, especially since the local newspapers have always had a certain political view inherent to them despite claiming otherwise. However, the radio might prove a solution to the problem - investing in the new machines might just bring Austria closer together."

AUS_sdap_4:0 "Work for the Workless"
AUS_sdap_4_desc:0 "Those who have lost their jobs with the ongoing crisis have already been granted pensions to hold them over the water. However, they still want work - since we already pay them anyways, we might as well employ them. Factories that have previously been shut down by their owners are now starting to sluggishly operate again, led by state-controlled councils."

AUS_sdap_5:0 "Initial Recovery"
AUS_sdap_5_desc:0 "The re-opening of some key industries has set the hare running again. While not quite turning a profit yet, we are producing what the people need again, and that is just what an economy needs to run smoothly. We're slowly opening up more industries, but only time will tell whether continuing to do so will lead to a full recovery."

AUS_sdap_6:0 "Past the Bottleneck"
AUS_sdap_6_desc:0 "After some initial recovery, the status of our economy has stalled for a while. However, it seems like it is finally taking a turn for the better, private industries are starting to follow the public lead and broaden production to keep up with their state-sponsored counterparts."

AUS_sdap_7:0 "A Recovering Industry"
AUS_sdap_7_desc:0 "The crisis is fading away, and in contrast to it, it seems like the Red Vienna policies have led to an age of prosperity. May the French and British say what they want, Social Democratism works for us."


AUS_cs_national_austerity_council:0 "National Austerity Council"
AUS_cs_national_austerity_council_desc:0 "The most important thing we need to remember when dealing with the ongoing economic crisis is that we must not let it accrue to already existing national debt. Austria's coffers need to be full, not empty, in the following years, and there is only one way to achieve this: Cutting spending drastically."

AUS_cs_fill_the_coffers:0 "Fill the Coffers"
AUS_cs_fill_the_coffers_desc:0 "What little we have, we must spend carefully - such was the creed of the CSP during the elections. Having in the last six years been involved in a major banking scandal, it was not sure that the people would trust us with their money. Now, we show them that they can."

AUS_cs_2:0 "Getting Inflation under Control"
AUS_cs_2_desc:0 "A nice bit of inflation is not a bad thing, hyperinflation is. We have to get rid of all that money circulating the market, and fast. The prices of bonds have been lowered and interest rates cranked up to the maximum; now we wait to see the effects of these measures."

AUS_cs_3:0 "Careful Investments"
AUS_cs_3_desc:0 "With our currency's value secured, we should take care that the little money we dare to spend goes to places that will return the investment. That of course means we have to look carefully at where our money can work the most. Thankfully, we have the assistance of a group of Austria's best economists."

AUS_cs_4:0 "Compromise with the SDAP"
AUS_cs_4_desc:0 "The Socialists have done quite the job stuffing their nonsense into the heads of the lowly cityfolk. Now that we are in power, we have to deal with that. We are meeting with the SDAP people to discuss the institution of some of the reforms they were marching for."

AUS_cs_5:0 "Subsidies for Farmers"
AUS_cs_5_desc:0 "The CSP has always been the party of the countryfolk. Socialists concern themselves only with the workers, and the farmers are too often forgotten. We are making this up for them by offering development grants."

AUS_cs_6:0 "Mend the Social Rift"
AUS_cs_6_desc:0 "All kinds of social classes are blaming each other for the disappearance of wealth, be it monetary or in goods. The Citizen blames the Farmer that he has no food, and the Farmer blames the Citizen that he has no money. Society is split, and only through careful discourse shall it be mended. This is where that arduous journey begins."

AUS_cs_7:0 "What We Need"
AUS_cs_7_desc:0 "Colonial Empires and the Reichspakt Labour are all fine and dandy, but it is luxury we do not need. You can not live from consuming ivory and cast steel. Germany can go get sunburnt, the man in Vienna knows his place, and want what he truly needs - a functioning economy and society, free from outside influences."

### Military Tree

AUS_military_expansion:0 "Expand the Austrian Military"
AUS_military_expansion_desc:0 "The economic woes of the Monarchy since the Weltkrieg has made it difficult for funds to reach the military. With the economic situation improving and tensions growing across the continent, military funding has significantly increased, allowing us to finally modernise our forces."

AUS_military_tech:0 "k.u.k. Technisches Militärkomitee"
AUS_military_tech_desc:0 "The Imperial & Royal Technical Military Committee, or TMK, with its origins dating from 1717, is an institution of the k.u.k. War Ministry tasked with the observation, development and application of military technology. Their role in modernising our armies is absolutely essential, ensuring that the Monarchy does not fall behind in terms of technological developments and that our troops remain well-equipped."

AUS_rifle_trials:0 "Rifle Trials"
AUS_rifle_trials_desc:0 "While the TMK was able to keep the Empire from falling too far behind despite limited resources, the War Ministry has yet to adopt a self-loading rifle for our forces. The committee wishes to rectify this and the Empire's numerous arms company are eager to compete for government contracts. In order to ensure that the best rifle is adopted, the TMK is organising new rifle trials."

AUS_artillery_modernisation:0 "Artillery Modernisation"
AUS_artillery_modernisation_desc:0 "While companies like Škoda and Böhler have been able to keep up with artillery development throughout the world thanks to foreign contracts, most of our artillery dates from the Weltkrieg. With the artillery being one of the most important pieces of military technology, the TMK is eager to replacing the military's ageing guns with modern ones as we expand our arsenal."

AUS_military_mountaineers:0 "Expand the Gebirgstruppe"
AUS_military_mountaineers_desc:0 "The Gebirgstruppe (Mountain Troops) includes some of the Monarchy's most decorated and respected units that repeatedly fought off Italian invasions. As they are essential to the Empire's defence and there are plenty of potential recruits in the Alpine and Carpathian regions, expanding and improving these units are a priority."

AUS_motorisation:0 "Militär-Automobilwesen Expansion"
AUS_motorisation_desc:0 "While the Austro-Hungarian Empire were pioneers in adopting automobiles for the military, they were always limited in numbers. The k.u.k. Militär-Automobilwesen is the section of the TMK responsible for the development and deployment of military vehicles. The importance of trucks is already clear to the General Staff and they made the motorisation of the army a priority."

AUS_tank_trials:0 "Tank Trials"
AUS_tank_trials_desc:0 "With the trauma of the Weltkrieg still fresh for many, tanks were eagerly embraced in the Austro-Hungarian military as their use were proven during the war, with companies such as Škoda and ČKD developing some of the most advanced tank designs in the world. As tank development rapidly advances, the TMK wants to hold trials for new tanks for different purposes."

AUS_radar:0 "Funkgestützte Flugzeugortung"
AUS_radar_desc:0 "The Hungarian mathematician Zoltán Lajos Bay's work on radars has caught the attention of the TMK and the Fliegerkorps, eager to put the invention into practice in order to improve the Empire's defences against threats from the skies. Experiments on the Funkgestützte Flugzeugortung (Radio-based Aircraft Locator) are proving fruitful and the Monarchy should have a working radar soon."

AUS_rockets:0 "Raketenflugtechnik"
AUS_rockets_desc:0 "There are a number of rocket scientists throughout the Empire, such as Eugen Sänger and Theodore von Kármán. While there are doubt about rocketry and its military applications, the Committee wants to develop rockets further, believing that their potential is too great to ignore."

AUS_reform_AOK:0 "Reform the Armeeoberkommando"
AUS_reform_AOK_desc:0 "The Armeeoberkommando (AOK), or Army High Command, was first formed in 1914. Its task was to unite the different commands of the Common Army, the Navy, the Austrian Landwehr and the Hungarian Honvéd to direct the war effort. Shortly after the war, however, the AOK was disbanded and our forces were divided once more. Recreating the AOK is deemed necessary to reunite the different forces."

AUS_doctrine_Jansa:0 "Janša's Central Planning"
AUS_doctrine_Jansa_desc:0 "Feldmarschall-Leutnant Alfred Janša von Tannenau, one of the possible candidates for the next Chief of Staff, believes in a defensive strategy for the Empire after the traumatic losses of the Weltkrieg. He believes that thorough planning and preparation are the best way to conduct a war, wanting to improve communications between commanders in order to limit casualties as much as possible."

AUS_doctrine_Hickmann:0 "Hickmann's Superior Firepower"
AUS_doctrine_Hickmann_desc:0 "Generalmajor-Ingenieur Emil Hickmann, a member of the General Staff, believes that the army should be focused on gaining a technical edge against the Monarchy's enemies. As the Weltkrieg remains a traumatic experience, limiting casualties is of utmost importance and Hickmann believes that improved fire support and equipment is key in modern warfare."

AUS_doctrine_von_Hubicki:0 "Von Hubicki's Mobile Warfare"
AUS_doctrine_von_Hubicki_desc:0 "General der Kavallerie Alfred von Hubicki, currently the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Cavalry, believes that the future of warfare are tanks and trucks. Mobility is key, with tanks being the new Hussars and Cuirassiers of the battlefield. This new cavalry must outmanoeuvre and overwhelm its enemies before they can react."

AUS_communications:0 "Improved Communications"
AUS_communications_desc:0 "Since the Weltkrieg began, inventions such as the radio has made communications between commanders and troops far easier. With better communications, high command can react to unforeseen events far more quickly, limit the damage they can cause, and counter."

AUS_better_support_equipment:0 "Maximise Fire Support"
AUS_better_support_equipment_desc:0 "Units must be properly equipped to be effective. The more support they have, the better they will perform with less casualties. This not only includes artillery, but trucks to evacuate the wounded, proper reconnaissance and maintenance units, and so on."

AUS_mech_cavalry:0 "Mechanised Cavalry"
AUS_mech_cavalry_desc:0 "While tanks are strong and all, they require support from the infantry or else they become extremely vulnerable. The infantry must be able to keep up with the tanks, and while trucks are good on roads, a tracked transport vehicle would be idea. Fortunately, a Hungarian unit has rebuilt obsolete tanks and artillery tractors into improvised armoured troop transports, which would fill the gap perfectly."

AUS_kavalleriepanzer:0 "Kavalleriepanzer Project"
AUS_kavalleriepanzer_desc:0 "As their name implies, Cavalry tanks effectively fill the role cavalry used to. Austria-Hungary has successfully developed and adopted several designs already and there is little impetus to change this. Since mobility is a key part of our new doctrine, development of new cavalry tanks must be prioritised."

AUS_infanteriepanzer:0 "Infanteriepanzer Project"
AUS_infanteriepanzer_desc:0 "While the military already has numerous successful cavalry tank designs, the Infantry tank project has been, thus far, unable to provide results. This must be rectified as infantry support is prioritised in our new doctrine and the project should be pushed further. The upcoming designs are becoming heavier and more expensive, but powerful and better protected."

AUS_auftragstaktik:0 "Modern Auftragstaktik"
AUS_auftragstaktik_desc:0 "Auftragstaktik, or Mission-type tactics, have been successfully adopted during the Weltkrieg. These tactics involve high command giving clearly-defined missions that subordinates work independently to accomplish, giving the latter great flexibility and encouraging initiative. Auftragstaktik can be adapted for modern war and applied to the new doctrine."

AUS_aviation_effort:0 "k.u.k. Fliegerkorps"
AUS_aviation_effort_desc:0 "Formerly known as the k.u.k. Luftfahrtruppen, the Fliegerkorps is the air service of Austria-Hungary. It was stretched thin during the Weltkrieg and had a limited number of aircraft at its disposal. Since the end of the war, little was done to rectify this as funding became scarce. With the military receiving substantial funds once more, modernising and expanding the Fliegerkorps is finally possible."

AUS_uzelac-plan:0 "Uzelac's Ground Support Plan"
AUS_uzelac-plan_desc:0 "Milan Emil Uzelac is the first commander of the Luftfahrtruppen and remains influential within the General Staff and the Fliegerkorps. He believes that the Fliegerkorps exists mainly to support the army in its operations. Therefore, the air force must focus on fighter aircrafts to maintain air superiority and light bombers to attack enemy positions on the front."

AUS_loehr-plan:0 "Löhr's Offensive Air Plan"
AUS_loehr-plan_desc:0 "Generalmajor Alexander Löhr is a proponent of strategic bombing and granting the Fliegerkorps further independence from the Army. With heavy bombers, the Fliegerkorps could bring the fight to any enemies of the Monarchy and destroy and military capabilities and morale."

AUS_flugschule:0 "Found the k.u.k. Flugschule"
AUS_flugschule_desc:0 "While there are numerous flying schools across Austria-Hungary, there has never been a centralised academy to coordinate the training of pilots and officers for the Fliegerkorps. The creation of such an institution is essential to the reforms as it will create a new generation of officers and pilots, while also streamlining the Korps into something less ad-hoc."

AUS_fighter_trials:0 "Fighter Trials"
AUS_fighter_trials_desc:0 "Aircraft development is advancing at an amazing pace. In order to keep up, trials are to be held to adopt a new fighter aircraft for the Fliegerkorps. After all, fighters are arguably the backbone of the air force and will help ensure the safety of our skies."

AUS_light_bomber_trials:0 "Light Bomber Trials"
AUS_light_bomber_trials_desc:0 "Since supporting operations of the army is a priority for the Fliegerkorps, the adoption of a light bomber aircraft for this role is necessary. Potential designs vary from relatively \"heavy\" two-engine bombers to fighters converted to dive bombers."

AUS_heavy_bomber_trials:0 "Heavy Bomber Trials"
AUS_heavy_bomber_trials_desc:0 "Heavy bombers are a relatively recent development in aircraft technology and proponents of strategic bombing see their potential. Their long range and large bomb loads make them perfect for the role. Thus, trials are being held and aircraft companies are eager to win such a lucrative contract."

AUS_medium_bomber_trials:0 "Medium Bomber Trials"
AUS_medium_bomber_trials_desc:0 "The potential of a versatile medium two-engine bombers for a variety of different missions has caught the attention of high command. Since a tactical bomber would be very useful for the Fliegerkorps, aircraft manufacturers are, once again, competing in trials for the next generation of bombers."

AUS_phoenix:0 "Phönix"
AUS_phoenix_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, a small company in Vienna, bearing the name Phönix company has supplied our air force by producing licenced German planes for our market. Since then, the company has experimented with various designs, some of which might be the key to modernising the Fliegerkorps."

AUS_mil_expanded:0 "The New k.u.k. Armee"
AUS_mil_expanded_desc:0 "The reform of our army has been a long and expensive process, but it has finally paid off. New tanks, guns, ships and planes are rolling off the assembly lines and into our waiting armies, reformed and ready for battle with the enemies of the Empire!"

AUS_naval_effort:0 "Reinforce the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine"
AUS_naval_effort_desc:0 "The k.u.k. Kriegsmarine has always been underfunded and unappreciated by the Austrian government and her people. Without a colonial empire the navy never had any real backing or strategic purpose. However, this is a dangerous mentality, and with new syndicalist threats in the Mediterranean, whole new Kriegsmarine is vital to protect our heartlands."

AUS_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Warfare"
AUS_flexible_navy_desc:0 "Our naval staff have decided to pursue a doctrine surrounding U-boats and convoy raiding, in order to be able to afflict as much damage as possible without having to face the overwhelming power of the French and British navies. Our Unterseeboots will strike the enemy where it hurts most, in the economy."

AUS_large_navy:0 "Large Navy Plan"
AUS_large_navy_desc:0 "In line with traditional doctrine, the Kriegsmarine staff have decided to support the larger surface fleet we currently possess. Centred around larger and larger battleships and increasing our firepower through larger naval guns, these ideas will help us project our power and support land operations."

AUS_capital_ships_effort:0 "Austrian Capital Ship Plan"
AUS_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "The staff have begun a concerted effort to improve upon our battleship designs, bringing more firepower to our battles. Increasing the size of the guns and the armoured belt allows our battleships to take far more of a beating leading attacks and deal far more damage in them as well."

AUS_small_ships_effort:0 "Austrian Small Ship Plan"
AUS_small_ships_effort_desc:0 "It has been decided that we need new models for destroyers and light cruisers, to combat enemy submarines and establish a surface presence. While our submarines are all well and good, larger ships are need to support land operations and do the tasks submarines do not have the firepower to complete."

AUS_cattaro:0 "The Cattaro Airbase"
AUS_cattaro_desc:0 "First built in 1914 as a base from which reconnaisance flights over the Adria were flown during the Weltkrieg, the k.k. airbase in the Bay of Cattaro, or Kotor, has fallen in disuse after the end of the war. However, its position close to the entry of the Adria might still prove strategically important."

### Ausgleich 1937

AUS_ausgleich:0 "Ausgleich Renegotiations of 1937"
AUS_ausgleich_desc:0 "Every ten years, 60 delegates from each half of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy meet to adjust each half's financial burden to Common affairs. Since 1927, Hungary has refused to pay its part in protest the creation of Illyria. This year's renegotiations could completely change the internal balance of the Monarchy."

### Occupation branch

AUS_military_occupation:0 "Military Occupation"
AUS_military_occupation_desc:0 "Hungary has been subdued, but we have no intention of letting them free in any capacity in the near future. Let all those who even think to challenge the Austrian Empire face the same fate they have."
AUS_status_quo:0 "Status Quo"
AUS_status_quo_desc:0 "Just like a decade prior, our negotiations for an administratively united Empire fell flat. We cannot do more than bide our time while trying to bind Transleithania closer by reform."

AUS_pintsch:0 "Pintsch AG"
AUS_bayer:0 "Bayer Österreich"

AUS_all_austrian_development_scheme:0 "The All-Austrian Development Scheme"
AUS_all_austrian_development_scheme_desc:0 "Although nominally the Empire has been reunited under one central government, the reality is a vastly different story. The old realms need time and effort to be integrated with the imperial administration, and for the myriad peoples of the Empire to accept our rule."

AUS_italy:0 "Renew Sicilian Ties"
AUS_italy_desc:0 "After the Weltkrieg, we reorganized Italy into a Federation of pre-unification states led by a Habsburg, but after the we withdrew from the south of Italy in 1925 most of the Federation abandoned our ambition and it collapsed. Should we rekindle our Neapolitan ties?"

AUS_italy_republic_ultimatum:0 "Regime Change in the Republic"
AUS_italy_republic_ultimatum_desc:0 "The Italian Republic in Milan to our South will always be a danger and thorn in our side. If we wish to return Austrian dominance to Italy, we must demand the Republicans restore power to the Council of the Italian Federation, so that they can't betray us when they have taken the rest of northern Italy."

AUS_ANI_tirol:0 "End the ANI"
AUS_ANI_tirol_desc:0 "The Italian Nationalist Association is, almost by definition, our mortal enemy. Their leaders are madmen, their nationalist rhetoric is dangerous, and their claims on our southern lands are unacceptable. We are not as vulnerable as they thought, and we will crush them like the insects they are."

AUS_italy_republic_friendship:0 "Friendship with Milan"
AUS_italy_republic_friendship_desc:0 "Since the southern Italian states seem unlikely to help us restore the Federation, we should put all our hopes in our ally in Milan. They have kept faith with us for a long time, and we shall return that friendship."

AUS_unify_italy:0 "Unify the Italian Lands"
AUS_unify_italy_desc:0 "The rising of the Italian syndicalists in Turin split the country in two, with the French backed Socialist Republic of Italy in the West, and the Italian Republic on our border. With Germany and France openly hostile to each other, helping out the Republic will not only endear us to them, but secure our flank for a war with France."

AUS_transcarpathian_railway:0 "The Transcarpathian Railway"
AUS_transcarpathian_railway_desc:0 "Reaching the far ends of the Empire had been hard to do for the past two decades, with Hungary refusing to let us modernise their railway network. Now that we are in control again, let us implement an old plan - a high velocity railway straight across the Carpathian Basin."

AUS_bohemian_lands:0 "Expand the Bohemian Infrastructure"
AUS_bohemian_lands_desc:0 "As the main border region between us and Germany it is vital that roads and rail systems remain well maintained and large enough to transport our army should a conflict break out. After the short but very mechanised war, Bohemia's roads are everything but well maintained, not helped by the fighting in the region from Czech rebels."

AUS_bohemian_resources:0 "Expand the Prag Ironworks"
AUS_bohemian_resources_desc:0 "With Prag now under the control of the new central government, it has become evident that the steel production of the city has fallen far from what should be. A new plan to subsidise the Prag Ironworks has been floated by the Kaiserrat, and it seems to have caught the attention of the Kaiser and the imperial administration."

AUS_hungarian_lands:0 "Rebuild the Hungarian Industry"
AUS_hungarian_lands_desc:0 "While mainly a rural country, Hungary did have large civilian industries towards the west, where, unfortunately, the majority of the fighting took place. Budapest, partially destroyed from the war, shall become the centrepiece of an effort by the imperial government to return the war-torn area to its former glory."

AUS_extend_hungarian_airbases:0 "Claim the Hungarian Skies"
AUS_extend_hungarian_airbases_desc:0 "Hungary is a vast country, and it is difficult to respond quickly to any new threat, especially from Romania and the Balkans. The construction of new airfields across the country will remedy this problem, as well as supporting local economies and the rebuilding effort across the country."

AUS_cro_bosnian_lands:0 "Expand Bosnian and Croat Industry"
AUS_cro_bosnian_lands_desc:0 "While not as damaged by warfare as Hungary, Bosnia and Croatia still suffered damage, which is being exacerbated by ethnic terrorism and dissent. However, as an important region for our navy and for civilian trade, the creation of new industries in this area would do far more for our economy than can be ignored."

AUS_adria_sea_ports:0 "Buildup Adriatic Ports"
AUS_adria_sea_ports_desc:0 "With new industry in place, it is time to increase our shipbuilding capacities and our capability to facilitate trade vital to our industries. These brand new shipyards will support our navy and merchant marine, ensuring our primary in the Adriatic over any potential Italian usurpers."

AUS_claim_serbia:0 "Crush Serbia"
AUS_claim_serbia_desc:0 "Serbia has long been a thorn in our side, from raids into Hungary during the period of Ottoman dominance to the death of Franz Ferdinand and the attacks on Bosnia. Such a belligerent nation cannot be allowed to sit on our border unchallenged, defying the authority of the Emperor solely by its own existence."

AUS_claim_romanian_lands:0 "Claim Romanian Lands"
AUS_claim_romanian_lands_desc:0 "The Romanian regime under Corneliu Codreanu claimed large parts of Transylvania and our easternmost provinces, on the grounds of large ethnic Romanian communities in the area. However, the current political instability renders the Romanian army far less effective than it could be, so now is the time to claim all Romania and Romanians for the Emperor!"

AUS_claim_silesia_desc:0 "Silesia was seized by the Prussians in 1742 during the War of Austrian Succession, and have held onto the former industrial heart of Austria-Hungary for nearly two hundred years now. With Germany being particularly unstable this time of year, we feel like now would be a good time to retake what is ours."

AUS_the_new_Empire:0 "Austrian Diplomatic Legacy"
AUS_the_new_Empire_desc:0 "Austria is not just a geographical region or a country. It is an idea, an expression of the belief in a holy Catholic empire that has been given a mandate to watch over Europe. Though for centuries our authority has been challenged within and without, our Empire has always persisted, for it is Austria's destiny to rule the world."

AUS_the_illyrian_suedbahn_desc:0 "The Südbahn, already competed towards Triest, could be easily extended into Illyria, which could help integrate the Agram basin and the Illyrian coastline into the Empies industries. This would also allow us to speed up production of new ships for our navy."

AUS_agram_industrial_complex:0 "The Agram Industrial Complex"
AUS_agram_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Agram, or Zagreb, has been made the capital of Illyria just a little more than a decade ago. It was mostly a choice of convenience, for the city was close to the Austrian border. However, a newly proposed plan sees the opening of a large-scale industrial complex to make it more worthy to be an capital of all Illyrians."

AUS_adriatic_ports:0 "Our Ports on the Adria"

AUS_northern_railway_bohemia_desc:0 "Given the fact that the Hungarian railway system is not up to par with what an industrialised Galicia would need to be integrated into the Empire's economy, the k.k.

AUS_austro-marxism_desc:0 "The old borders of the Empire and the old administration don't acknowledge how absurdly ethnically diverse our Empire is. There are no Bohemians, only Germans and Czechs - likewise no Galicians, only Poles and Ruthenians. The old administration doesn't even keep track which nationality people are. This has to end."

#The Austromarxist principle of National Personal Autonomy describes a way of gathering the geographically divided members of the same nation to "organise nations not in territorial bodies but in simple association of persons", thus radically disjoining the nation from the territory and making of the nation a non-territorial association."

AUS_united_states:0 "A Federation of Equals"
AUS_united_states_desc:0 "The United States of Greater Austria, or "Vereinigte Staaten von Groß-Österreich", was a proposal, conceived by a group of scholars surrounding Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.

AUS_decentralised_docks:0 "Naval Buildup Scheme"
AUS_decentralised_docks_desc:0 "Everybody knows that a strong navy is the sign of a truly significant power. Our federalising efforts can only work if they are tied into the prestigious naval arms race, and expanding our shipbuilding capability will go a long way to supporting them."

AUS_decentralised_factories:0 "Industrial Parks"
AUS_decentralised_factories_desc:0 "As part of our Scheme it is imperative that we do not ignore the civilian sector, no matter the state of current geopolitics. Workers need goods, and we must of course be in a position to export and import consumer products and natural resources."

AUS_decentralised_more_factories:0 "Industrial Regions"

AUS_transformation_of_nature_desc:0 "Our efforts have to go beyond merely the matter of mankind, it must go into the very fabric of nature itself. If we are to develop our newly reinvigorated state further we have to do whatever it takes, even despoiling some of our beautiful wilderness."

AUS_am_followup_2_desc:0 "Though it has been a struggle, our nation has demonstrably shown its resilience in recent months.

AUS_am_followup_3_desc:0 "For too long we have endured this farce known as the Ausgleich. It must end if we are to soldier on into the future as a strong and unified nation. Though it may be a leap into the dark, this arcane process must be stopped no matter the consequences."

### Events ###
austria.1.t:0 "The Situation of Austria in 1936"
austria.1.d:0 "Despite standing amongst the victors of the Weltkrieg, the war revealed the divisions of culture, class and ideology within the Empire ever so clearly, and the inner unrest continued on as the war ended.\n\nKaiser Karl, following in the footsteps of the assassinated Franz Ferdinand in trying to reform the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire into something that could survive in the twentieth century, launched a series of large scale reforms; however, his efforts were largely blocked by nobility of the Hungarian side of the Empire - leading to his plans of federalisation progressing only slowly, and only on the Cisleithanian side of the Empire.\n\nHowever, many feel that there is hope for Austria - the last decades were hard on the Empire, but the effort has started paying off. Cisleithanian Austria, now a federation-state, has calmed down - but the same cannot be said for Transleithania. It is, however, unlikely that the Carpathian basin will continue to remain in Magyar hands, since Hungary's peoples have been gazing upon the liberties across the Leitha, wishing to have such autonomy for themselves. Whether reform will be able to find its way to Hungary, only the Kaiser knows for sure."
austria.1.a:0 "Austria erit in orbe ultima."

austria.3.t:0 "The Death of Kaiser Karl"
austria.3.d:0 "Suffering from chronical bronchitis, Kaiser Karl has died today."
austria.3.a:0 "Long Live Kaiser Otto!"

aus.elections.1.t:0 "Austrian Elections of 1936"
aus.elections.1.d:0 "Since federalisation begun, and the 'Austrian elections' were mostly reduced to the German-speaking part of the Empire, two major parties have dominated Austrian politics: the CS and the SDAP.\n\nThis year's elections, too, are harshly fought; the SDAP and CS have very different ideas of dealing with the ongoing economic crisis. The SDAP's programme focuses on easing the worker's plight, with a focus on unemployment benefits and government intervention. The CS, on the other hand, follow a programme of severe austerity measurements."
aus.elections.1.a:0 "It is for the people to decide."

aus.elections.2.t:0 "Opening of School & SDAP Rally"
aus.elections.2.d:0 "Even if the economic situation of Austria has been dire for a while, the first years after the Weltkrieg, when the CS and SDAP still cooperated in their governance, [Root.GetNameDef] saw widespread reforms in education and welfare. Academies for specialised workers began construction, workers' pensions were introduced, and child labour was once and for all eliminated. Vienna has been regarded as a front-runner in socialist circles.\n\nToday, a new academy is opened in the ninth district of Vienna, which the SDAP sees as a major success. Many speeches by various politicians are held, Karl Renner always standing in the background.\n\nRenner has been the effective head of the party since he found the goodwill of the Emperor during the Weltkrieg with a policy of Burgfrieden and cooperation with the Crown."
aus.elections.2.a:0 "Their efforts are praiseworthy."
aus.elections.2.b:0 "I'd prefer it if they didn't claim the successes of a joint government as their own."

aus.elections.3.t:0 "Adler Denounces the SDAP"
aus.elections.3.d:0 "Friedrich Adler, son of the former head of the SDAP and a Radical Socialist mostly known for shooting Graf Stürgkh in protest of the Weltkrieg, has denounced the SDAP as "the kind of socialism that is just serving the establishment"."
aus.elections.3.a:0 "Radicals will be Radicals."

aus.elections.4.t:0 "The CS Invites Prince Otto to Hunt"
aus.elections.4.d:0 "The CS, the party of the petite bourgeoisie, the Catholic church, and the conservative countryside, usually refrains from holding large public events. In Vienna, they instead focus their efforts on smaller, private meetings. One such planned meeting will be in the form of a hunt in the Wienerwald.\n\nPrince Otto was formally invited to join the hunt. Having enjoyed an aristocratic education, the Habsburg heir is already used to such social occasions."
aus.elections.4.a:0 "If he wants to..."
aus.elections.4.b:0 "The Imperial Family is above such trivial things."

aus.elections.5.t:0 "Successful Hunt for the CS"
aus.elections.5.d:0 "Following the hunt, a feast was held, during which the a radio interview with several prominent CS figures, but also Prince Otto, was recorded. It seems like this was on purpose, as Prince Otto is now being associated with the party, and support amongst our most devoted subjects for the party has increased."
aus.elections.5.a:0 "Is this what they were hunting for?"

aus.elections.6.t:0 "Hunting Accident: Is Prince Otto hurt?"
aus.elections.6.d:0 "During what has been confirmed as an accident by all bystanders, the hunting rifle of the son of a prominent CS politician misfired, grazing Prince Otto's right leg in the process. While the heir to the throne sustained no serious injuries during the incident, the media are already spinning their conspiracy theories."

### Italian Question ###
austria.100.t:0 "Our Relations with Naples"
austria.100.d:0 "Though our Italian Federation and plans for an Austrian-dominated Italy failed, we are far stronger now than we were in 1926. Should we send an envoy to the court of King Ferdinand III, asking him to mend our broken ties, and help restore order to Italy?"
austria.100.a:0 "Renew our southern ties!"
austria.100.b:0 "Milan is a safer bet."

austria.101.t:0 "A Message of Friendship from Austria"
austria.101.d:0 "Today, a distinguished Austrian ambassador arrived in the capital. He spoke of the great friendship our two nations have always enjoyed. He also said that the Imperial and Royal Government viewed with trepidation the threat to our west, and that Kaiser Karl encouraged swift reunification."
austria.101.a:0 "This sounds like a great idea."
austria.101.b:0 "The Austrians are our natural enemy."

austria.102.t:0 "Austro-Italian Friendship"
austria.102.d:0 "Today, our ambassador returned from Italy. He informed us about the Italian agreement to our proposal of friendship. A great future lies before our countries."
austria.102.a:0 "Good."

austria.103.t:0 "Austro-Italian Rivalry"
austria.103.d:0 "Today, our ambassador returned from Italy. He informed us that the Italians have declined our proposal of friendship. This is an insult against all our country stands for. Maybe we should once more point our armies at them, as we did during the Weltkrieg."
austria.103.a:0 "We will have our revenge."

### Austria Suggests War ###
austria.104.t:0 "Austria Suggests a War"
austria.104.d:0 "The Austrian ambassador today suggested that we prepare our forces for an attack on the socialists. He said the time has come to strike at them and unite Italy."
austria.104.a:0 "We will crush them!"
austria.104.b:0 "We cannot do that."

austria.105.t:0 "War in Italy"
austria.105.d:0 "In response to our suggestion, Italy declared war on the SRI. While they have undoubtedly prepared for this day, we could augment their weapon stores with some of our own equipment, and even set up some volunteer regiments from our Italian-speaking lands. Should we send them this aid?"
austria.105.a:0 "Send them help."
austria.105.b:0 "They will make do."

austria.106.t:0 "Austrian Help Arrives"
austria.106.d:0 "Today, Austrian help has arrived in our land. They have sent us troops and weapons to defeat the enemy."
austria.106.a:0 "Thank God."

austria.107.t:0 "Naples Accepts"
austria.107.d:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies has, surprisingly, accepted our offer of friendship, even though we abandoned them in 1926. However, now that they have proven receptive once again to their rightful protector and ally, we shall be sure to never fail them again!"
austria.107.a:0 "We won't fail you again."

austria.108.t:0 "The Bourbons Refuse"
austria.108.d:0 "Angry at our last betrayal and openly doubting the usefulness of our friendship, the Sicilian ambassador has informed our government that there is to be no deal between Naples and Vienna. We must rely on Milan and Venice for an Italian ally."
austria.108.a:0 "Damn."

austria.109.t:0 "The Iron Feldmarschall and Freiherr Falters...?"
austria.109.d:0 "One of the highest ranking military officers in the K.u.K, an instrumental player in Austria’s victory in the Weltkrieg, a military man made noble by the Emperor, and perhaps the greatest slayer of Serbs to still draw breath, Franz Xaver Josef Conrad von Hötzendorf is one of the most widely respected men in the Empire. With an illustrious military career that spans longer than the age of many of his contemporaries, this 84 year old wardog has survived the ravages of old age and weathered the mistress of time, fueled entirely by his love for the Empire and his burning, eternal, and violent hatred for the Serb. Viewing these Southern Slavs as little more than opportunistic, traitorous vermin, von Hötzendorf has made a career out of continuously beating these cretens into the ground conflict after conflict. However, the outcome of the Weltkrieg and its aftermath have caused this unruly hive of scum and villainy to slip free of our grasp once again. Though this has largely caused ethnic stability to improve within the wider Empire, it has also served to breathe life into von Hötzendorf’s stubborn old soul. Through sickness, injury, and increasing age, von Hötzendorf has persevered, living off the hope that one day he would see Sarajevo burn once more by his own hand. \n\nHowever, this old veteran may not get the chance to see such a wondrous sight, for his health has begun to take a turn for the worse recently following a trip abroad to Constantinople on some nanny assignment strong-arming the Ottomans into paying their debts. Though he has fought off far worse before, von Hötzendorf’s advanced age and recent exhaustion have proven to make a potentially deadly mix. As the nation prays that their national hero recovers, von Hötzendorf sits restlessly in his hospital room, itching for his chance to get back into action as he slowly recovers. Although the initial prognosis looked grim, von Hötzendorf has conquered worse hurdles, and his old fervor and refined hatred turned to drive may just once again see him through the woods."
austria.109.a:0 "The old war hero finally gives up the ghost, and is honored with a state funeral."
austria.109.b:0 "Hötzendorf will be damned if he rests in Heaven while a free Serbia still stands!"

ausgleich.new.100.t:0 "Ausgleich Preparations"
ausgleich.new.100.d:0 "Every ten years since 1867, Austrian and Hungarian delegations meet to discuss how much each side of the Empire puts into the Common ministries: the ministries for foreign, military and financial affairs.\n\nHowever, due to their loss and demand for reparations for the Croatian territories, the re-negotiations of 1927 came to a standstill, resulting in Hungary not having paid anything into the common treasury for the last decade.\n\nHungary's state as a renegade Crown under the Kaiser's reign has been a thorn in Austria's side for a while now, and at least some efforts have to be made to bring them back to the herd."

ausgleich.new.101.d:0 "The Viennese government has invited us to re-negotiate the Ausgleich.

ausgleich.new.102.a:0 "Naturally they do."

ausgleich.new.200.t:0 "Invite Others to the Ausgleich?"
ausgleich.new.200.d:0 "The Ausgleich has always been conducted as a meeting of the Austrian and the Hungarian elite.

Once one of the dominant forces in the Balkans, Austria has seen continuous decline for decades and, while their hollow victory in the Weltkrieg brought a brief respite, this war may have finally brought down the once-proud Empire.

Swallowing their pride, they have come to [Root.GetNameDef] to ask for our intervention and protection. With us at the peace talks, we can ensure the Austrians are not dismantled completely, and in exchange they and their remaining subjects will join the Reichspakt alliance. This could mean becoming involved in a Balkan war, but if we ignore the situation the Balkans nations could continue their aggressive expansion... and who knows what side they'll pick in the future?"

Slovenia, long an integral part of Austria proper, has been petitioning entry into Illyria ever since its inception in the 1927 Ausgleich. Relations between the Austrians and Slovenes have reached a tipping point at last, as Slovenes threaten secession and rebellion if Austria does not listen to them. Relations between the Special Status Territory of Illyria and Austria have also been strained, as the Illyrian government supports the Slovenes. Talk spreads in Zagreb about the possibility of revolt. Meanwhile, the three other crowns of the Empire sit on the sidelines, wondering whether to secede themselves or stay in it to the end."

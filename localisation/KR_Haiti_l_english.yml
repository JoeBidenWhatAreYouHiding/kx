### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JACQUES_ROMAIN_DESC:0 "Born in June, 1907, to a wealthy family, Jacques Roumain was educated across the world, and eventually became a prolific poet. Though the man was once a close associate of both liberal and Noiriste writers alike, he founded the 'Parti Syndicaliste' together with a close-knit group of like minded ideologues and began the formalization of the fragmented Haitian left. While he would alienate his former allies in the process, the movement he would create propelled him to the forefront of opposition to the authoritarian regime of Louis Borno. Now, Roumain and his close associate Max Hudicourt look to bring Haiti into a new age of prosperity, but first they will have to face many challenges, with the most prominent challenge being one another..."
POLITICS_GEORGES_RIGAUD_DESC:0 "A leader of protests against the discriminatory policies the United States imposed upon Haitian education system, Rigaud was beaten to inch of his life at the hands of American Marines as a young student in Port-Au-Prince. Soon thereafter, as a leader of the burgeoning labor movement, while others within the Haitian left would embrace fully European ideas of socialism, Rigaud would instead attempt to mold syndicalist ideas to fit the unique history and culture of Haiti."
POLITICS_LOUIS_BORNO_DESC:0 "From his birth in 1865, Louis Borno has had an active life. Growing up in a mixed-race family and having ties to Europe and America that reach back decades, his political career gained steam before finally coming to a head in the early 1920's. In 1922, Louis Borno was elected in a seeming act of defiance by the Council of State against the occupying Americans. Borno, however, would prove entirely willing to not only cooperate with the United States, but work hand in hand to ensure their mutual success. During the occupation, Borno, with the approval of Marine General John Russell and the United States, did his best to build the Haitian economy, but whatever he did, it would be an economy deeply dependent on America to function. With the recent end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno has been able to remain in charge, but none can say how long this state of affairs will last.\nDespite his years of rule and his original popularity, Borno is now known as an American puppet, nothing more than a useful instrument for the interests of Washington and New York City. As he looks to the future, the aging President Borno is faced with threats to his rule both from within Haiti and without, and his successes and failures alike will undoubtedly shape Haiti's future political landscape for years to come."
POLITICS_MAX_HUDICOURT_DESC:0 "Max Hudicourt, a man who has barely reached thirty years of age, has already achieved more than most in Haiti will ever dream of. It is this desire for achievement that has motivated him; from writing to law to activism, Hudicourt has not waited for anyone to give him anything, despite being from an elite background. His gift for charisma is perhaps only outweighed by who he knows. Hudicourt has become close with Jacques Roumain, who he has always seen as a sort of mentor, despite being similar in age to the man. The two men have built the Haitian left to the powerful status it holds today, but it seems that only one man could rule Haiti. As such, conflict between Hudicourt and his mentor was inevitable, and now that Hudicourt rules alone, there are few who can challenge his rule. For now, Hudicourt has prevailed, and he will do his best to see that his will is followed in all of Haiti."   
POLITICS_DEMOSTHENES_CALIXTE_DESC:0 "Not much is known about Colonel Démosthènes Pétrus Calixte's upbringing, other than the fact that he is a Black Haitian who wants the best for his people. Though Calixte has traditionally remained a military figure, specializing in cavalry tactics, he has recently made a foray into the Haitian political scene. Calixte, seeing the rising influence of extremist movements on both sides of the political aisle, has vowed to not allow Haiti to fall into the hands of these groups, especially by military means. For him, standing aside while the Noiristes or the Socialists couped the government would be the greatest dishonor, and so, Calixte acted when he was called upon, and restored order to the people of Haiti. Now that he is in power though, there is much to do before the country can have any sense of stability."
POLITICS_FAUSTIN_MARINE_DESC:0 "Born in 1896 to Polish-American immigrants, though none can agree where exactly, Faustin Wirkus is a strange sight in Haiti. His east Prussian roots make him obviously out of place, but despite this, he has made a home for himself in the country. Originally just a marine in the Garde, so low that he was called a "breaker boy", Wirkus has risen through the ranks, both in the military and in Haiti. In a bizarre 1920 meeting, Wirkus met with several prisoners on the island of La Gonave, including a woman who identified herself as Ti Memenne, the queen of the island. After promising to meet again, the two departed, and it would only be a few years before the two did indeed cross paths once more. This time, Wirkus had sought the woman out in the inland of the island, and after repeatedly applying for duty on the island, he was crowned as the king of the island in 1926 in an elaborate vodou ceremony. Given his first name of "Faustin", the natives took him as the successor to Faustin I, the old ruler of La Gonave who had supposedly promised to return one day. Wirkus has lived up to these expectations, serving as the king of the island for ten years while also upholding his duties as a marine, and in both positions, he is known for his leadership and gentle rule. However, few know of his position as king, and the ones who do think little of it, believing it a curious but otherwise unthreatening title. For his part though, Wirkus, now Faustin II, takes his position seriously, and he has vowed to protect the Haitian people at any cost. \n\n Now that he is in power, he has seized power from the American lapdogs and vows to keep it that way, instead serving as the leader Haiti needs in these times of crisis. Though he plans to gradually unveil his status as the King of La Gonave, he rules as a military man for now, awaiting his opportunity to become the man he was always meant to be..."

For his part though, Wirkus, now Faustin II, takes his position seriously, and he has vowed to protect the Haitian people at any cost. \n\n With his rule now consolided, Wirkus has begun to adopt royal trappings, although he has not outright proclaimed himself emperor. He has also begun to embrace Vodou, although seemingly with caution and only those aspects that fit his Catholic faith. Despite his reluctance to embrace what his advisors call his birthright, the Haitian people adore their leader, and have made him one of their own."
POLITICS_FAUSTIN_EMPEROR_DESC:0 "Born in 1896 to Polish-American immigrants, though none can agree where exactly, Faustin Wirkus is a strange sight in Haiti. His east Prussian roots make him obviously out of place, but despite this, he has made a home for himself in the country.

For his part though, Wirkus, now Faustin II, takes his position seriously, and he has vowed to protect the Haitian people at any cost. \n\n With him finally and perhaps prodveintally fully embracing Hatian culture, making himself truly one with the people, Wirkus has been declared Faustin II, Emperor of Haiti. Basing his thin legitimacy on Vodou and being the reincarnation of Faustin I, Faustin II has truly become a monarch of the people. While allegedly in private he is only using Vodou as an attempt to get the people to return to Catholicism, he does all he can to maintain the safety and happiness of his subjects."
POLITICS_FRANCOIS_DUVALIER_DESC:0 "Francois Duvalier was born in April of 1907 to an Afro-Haitian family, and was raised by his aunt. After studying in American and Haitian schools alike, Duvalier became a staff physician. It was in his time as a physician that Duvalier received the nickname 'Papa Doc', but despite his penchant for healing, his interest in politics has been just as prominent in his life. In that realm, Duvalier became interested in Noirisme, Negritude, and Black Nationalism, being one of the founders of the Griot movement and now serving as Carl Brouard's most trusted confidant. Brouard and Duvalier were always a dynamic duo, with both men having an intellectual background and a desire to see Haiti forge its own place in the world. However, the growing incompetence of Brouard coupled with his habit as a drunkard made it clear to all, most of all Duvalier, that action needed to be taken if the regime were to survive. Now that he has dispensed with Brouard, Francois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier rules Haiti with complete control, and Duvalier looks both inwards and outwards to further consolidate his power, whatever it takes."
POLITICS_CARL_BROUARD_DESC:0 "Born in December of 1902 to a mixed background, Carl Brouard always had a promising life ahead of him if he chose to reach out and take it. His decision to become a poet and a political activist surprised none of the people who knew him well, and it is in fact these same people who helped Brouard rise to a position of leadership in Haiti. Brouard's old friend Jacques Roumain may be a rival now, but their affections for one another have kept the peace in Haiti. Other allies such as Lorimer Dennis and Francois Duvalier helped Brouard create a newspaper for their movement, and the three men have been close ever since. Now, as Brouard stands at the head of a nation beset by chaos and misery, he is flanked by his loyal right-hand man Francois Duvalier, though some whisper that it is Duvalier that holds the true power in the regime. As for Brouard, it seems that his ascent to power has been met with a bout of depression and alcoholism, and few are confident that he will be able to last in his current state. The country, and the world as a whole, watch curiously to see if Carl Brouard can do what must be done to stabilize Haiti, or if he will just be another footnote in history."
POLITICS_GERALD_THOMAS_DESC:0 "A Marine born in 1894, Thomas has always been loyal to America before any other country, despite serving abroad in multiple regions. However, he has spent nearly as much time in Haiti, where he has served as one of the highest ranking Americans in the country. With Russell gone and the threat of Faustin Wirkus lurking around the corner, Thomas must do everything he can to maintain an American presence in Haiti, even without American help."
POLITICS_JOHN_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "General John Russell's long tenure as American Marine Commissioner for Haiti suffered only a minor hiccup with the withdrawal of American Marines from the country, still keeping a close eye on the affairs of Haiti's civilian government. While sympathetic to the Haitian people and holding surprisingly tolerant racial views, Russell is loyal only to the United States."
POLITICS_FRANCK_LAVAUD_DESC:0 "Franck Lavaud is somewhat of an anomaly in Haiti. Born in 1903 to a mixed family background, Lavaud has risen through the ranks of Haiti's military, and is one of the few native commanders in the Haitian Garde. As such, he has appeal for most factions in the country; few can find something to dislike about Lavaud. However, his interest in politics has come from what he views as a necessity to keep order and balance American and Haitian interests as much as possible, in order to keep the peace. To do so, he made plans with Paul Magloire to jointly take over if the country spun out of control, and as soon as it did, the two took action. Now, as the two rule Haiti, it seems they will be just the duo that is needed to keep the peace, but only time will tell how successful they will be..."
POLITICS_PAUL_MAGLOIRE_DESC:0 "Paul Magloire, son of the General Eugene Magloire and his wife Marie-Philomene Mathieu, was born in July of 1907. As a soldier, he became acquainted with Franck Lavaud, and the two quickly became allies of sorts. Both men had been concerned about the future of Haiti and the possibility of Borno losing control for years, so when it really happened, the two quickly seized power for the good of all Haitians. Now that Magloire and Lavaud rule Haiti, they will do their best to keep both the military and the wider population under their control, but only time will tell how successful they will be..."
POLITICS_LOUIS_DEJOIE_DESC:0 "Pierre Joseph Louis Dejoie is a rare specimin among Haitian politicians. A self-made man, he made his fortune in the sugar industry, while also dipping his toe in industry, agriculture, and land ownership. Dejoie is one of the wealthiest men in Haiti today, but wealth alone is not enough to rescue Haiti. To truly bring the country back from the brink, Dejoie believes he must lead the country with his business acumen, perhaps even modernizing the Haitian economy. Dejoie's golden touch may be enough to save Haiti's economy, but it is clear he will face other challenges, both within and without..."
POLITICS_JEAN_PRICE_MARS_DESC:0 "Born in October, 1876, Jean Price-Mars is somewhat of an everyman. His backgrounds in medicine, diplomacy, writing, teaching, ethnography, and vodou made him a well-educated and sought-out man, but it was his entrance into politics that brought him wide fame. Price-Mars, having some agreements and some disagreements with others in the Negritude, helped form the coalition of liberal parties that is now referred to as the Parti Haïtien. Price-Mars believes in the concept of collective bovarysme, that is, Haitian elites embracing their European heritage while trying to distance themselves from any African roots they may have. It is this distaste for the elites that has fueled the rise of Price-Mars, for their greed and arrogance have nearly destroyed Haiti, at least according to Price-Mars. Now that he is in power, he has vowed to do whatever he must to combat these elites, whether it be in education, the economy, or even society as a whole."
POLITICS_STENIO_VINCENT_DESC:0 "Stenio Vincent, born in 1874 and never resting since, is one of the most powerful men in Haiti. He has played a role in government since the days when many of his rivals, Roumain, Hudicourt, and Duvalier, were all under ten years of age, in 1915. Despite his experience though, Vincent has been repeatedly frustrated in recent years by a lack of respect or even basic openness to his proposals. His fierce opposition to the American occupation went relatively ignored for years, and only now that the Americans are gone has he gotten credit for this opposition. Nonetheless, Vincent is in power now, but he refuses to rest. He perceives enemies all around him, most of all the leftists in Haiti itself. The president is convinced that these forces are eager to attempt a coup on him at any opportunity, though there is little evidence for such assertions beyond his own sheer hatred for these groups. Vincent is no friend of the Noirists either, showing a great distaste for their extremist views and what is, in his view, a tendency for them to overlap with leftists. Vincent respects the United States and the Dominican Republic alike, but he will not shirk his duty to Haiti. Enemies within and abroad will be dealt with, and Haiti will keep its unique and cherished culture."

#### Focus Tree ###
HAI_begin_education_reform:0 "Begin Education Reform"
HAI_begin_education_reform_desc:0 "Our educational system has failed at nearly every turn. Our farmers do not even know how to properly sow and harvest crops despite our largely agrarian economy, with agricultural schools funded decades ago failing in every criteria to teach our populace the basics of plant care. This must be amended. No longer will the only good schools in Haiti be the universities funded and filled with foreigners."

HAI_approach_the_commission:0 "Approach the Commission"
HAI_approach_the_commission_desc:0 "The Commision stands as the last great footprint of the American Occupation, leaving many a facility or investigation left open and unutilized since the Yankee’s departure. We should convene to discuss how we should deal with these remnants of our oppressive benefactors."

HAI_new_normal:0 "A New Normal"
HAI_new_normal_desc:0 "With our newest reforms and policies earning us great dividends both financially and with the public, a new sense of normal has set it. Though it may just be the calm before the storm, all are basking in this placid moment of normalcy."

HAI_reorganize_rural_schools:0 "Reorganize Rural Schools"
HAI_reorganize_rural_schools_desc:0 "In order to better teach the illiterate and uneducated masses that exist in rural squalor, we must reorganize the rural school system. A shared curriculum and more funding shall be instituted, and new teachers actually knowledgeable on the topics they teach will be paramount to these new schools’ success."

HAI_reform_snpaer:0 "Reform SNPAER"
HAI_reform_snpaer_desc:0 "SNPAER is a system of agricultural programs and schools that were meant to support and educate our farmers on proper land usage and farming techniques. However, they have largely been useless, both underfunded and understaffed, and sweeping reform is necessary if we are to further modernize our agricultural industry."

HAI_vocational_academies:0 "Vocational Academies"
HAI_vocational_academies_desc:0 "Vocational academies can serve as a useful supplement to the regular schooling system, teaching useful skills to those who do not excel at intellectual academics. We must implement an official state system of trade schools to give the average Haitian a chance at a solid career and a productive life."

HAI_integrate_jesuits:0 "Integrate Jesuits"
HAI_integrate_jesuits_desc:0 "The Order of Jesus, or the Jesuits, run many schools across our nation, teaching Christian values and educational basics. We must reach out to this holy order and integrate their schools into our educational system. While we might have to slightly secularize their curriculum, their aid will be immeasurable in our fight against illiteracy and uneducation."

HAI_open_universities:0 "Open Universities"
HAI_open_universities_desc:0 "We will need to both open new universities while also expanding admissions to our already existing ones to ensure access to higher education for all Haitians. Currently, our few universities only serve foreigners or White and Mixed race elites. This system of educational privilege must end if Haiti is to prosper."

HAI_expand_lycees:0 "Expand Lycées"
HAI_expand_lycees_desc:0 "The Lycées are a system of French-based secondary schooling, usually only accessible to more affluent Haitians. We must expand this educational wing to further grant schooling to the impoverished and ignorant Haitian youth."

HAI_4c_organizations:0 "4C Organizations"
HAI_4c_organizations_desc:0 "Based on the American 4-H Organizations, the 4C clubs shall echo their Yankee counterparts. Standing for ‘coeur, cerveau, corps, and conscience’ these clubs shall guide Haitian youth on a path of structure and diligence while teaching them necessary trades and tasks they might need in Haiti’s more common career paths."

HAI_adult_education:0 "Adult Education"
HAI_adult_education_desc:0 "We must not only focus on the education of our children, as much of our adult population still lies woefully uneducated and ignorant to the wider world even basic education can unlock. New night schools for adults shall be created to bring learning to our busier citizens while day courses shall be expanded and created to teach the rest until they can become more productive members of society."

HAI_status_of_the_legislature:0 "Status of the Legislature"
HAI_status_of_the_legislature_desc:0 "With the American Occupation over, the Borno regime can no longer reign with a sidelined legislature without some sort of formal declaration. We must approach this tenuous situation and finally decide the future of Haiti’s legislative body and its place in our regime."

HAI_reform_council:0 "Reform the Council"
HAI_reform_council_desc:0 "The Council of Haiti serves as the lower house of our bicameral legislative body. We must reform this voice piece of the people so that it truly acts according to the Haitian people’s will, and not to the will of foreign masters or native lapdogs."

HAI_dismiss_foreigners:0 "Dismiss Foreigners"
HAI_dismiss_foreigners_desc:0 "Foreigners are a scourge upon our shores, lording over our native people without a care for who they crush underfoot. We must excise these demons from our borders if Haiti is ever to truly work for the Haitian people and not foreign interest groups."

HAI_mixed_council:0 "A Mixed Council"
HAI_mixed_council_desc:0 "A Mixed Council is paramount to ensuring our newly empowered lower house truly represents the will of the varied Haitian people. Mixed race, White, and Afro-Haitians shall all stand together as equals in this house, with all ideologies and camps welcome to lend their voice and opinions. Together, we shall build a better Haiti."

HAI_reel_in_garde:0 "Reel in the Garde"
HAI_reel_in_garde_desc:0 "The Garde d'Haïti serves as our only real military force, formed in the ashes of our former gendarmerie and army. Serving as a functional puppet of American and Elitist interests, they can not be trusted to serve the Haitian people unbiasedly. We must reign them in lest they become too powerful a force to stop."

HAI_legalize_parties:0 "Legalize Parties"
HAI_legalize_parties_desc:0 "In order for true democracy to return to our crumbling republic, political parties must be let out the dark and allowed to operate. The only question is, which parties shall be allowed to function legally once more. Socialism has grown greatly in popularity in our nation, and the Reds are clamoring for their own legal party, much to the chagrin of our more conervative ministers. We must tread carefully, as this choice could dictate the future of our politics for decades to come."

HAI_integrate_the_council:0 "Integrate the Council"
HAI_integrate_the_council_desc:0 "The Council shall be fully integrated into our administration once again as a fully functioning body of the state; one independent of meddling and influencing from more nefarious actors. The Council shall now finally work for the Haitian people and them alone."

HAI_limit_garde_influence:0 "Limit Garde Influence"
HAI_limit_garde_influence_desc:0 "The Garde d'Haïti, aside from their functions as a paramilitary and police force, have also taken to extreme political lobbying efforts to further their goals and the goals of their American benefactors. We must curb this influence if we are to maintain any semblance of control over their ranks."

HAI_electoral_reform:0 "Electoral Reform"
HAI_electoral_reform_desc:0 "Extensive electoral reforms must be undertaken if we are to create even an air of true democratic operations within our administration. The entire voting and electoral apparatus will be overhauled to ensure another tyrant doesn’t slip into the position again."

HAI_establish_oversight_committee:0 "Establish Oversight Committees"
HAI_establish_oversight_committee_desc:0 "With the planned elections growing more prominent in everyone’s minds, an electoral watchdog has been implemented to survey the coming elections and their campaigns, scanning every detail for signs of fraud. We will not allow corruption to taint the people’s will!"

HAI_preside_the_chamber:0 "Preside the Chamber"
HAI_preside_the_chamber_desc:0 "With our reforms coming along smoothly, we must preside over the combined Chamber and dictate our plans going forward. We will make it clear that our path is towards democracy. The Haitian Republic will no longer bear the taint of kleptocracy and kakistocracy."

HAI_smash_coalition:0 "Smash the Coalition"
HAI_smash_coalition_desc:0 "The Coalition has stood for decades; a union of parties from the Left, Right, and Centre banded together in opposition against Borno and the Americans. With democracy on its way, the coalition must be broken so that political independence and choice may once again reign."

HAI_stable_system:0 "A Stable System"
HAI_stable_system_desc:0 "We have done the impossible and righted the sinking ship that was Haitian democracy. With our twinkling republic saved, it is time for our nation to move forward into a fairer and more equal future. Long live the Republic of Haiti, for we now truly represent the will of our people."

HAI_dissolve_chamber:0 "Dissolve the Chamber"
HAI_dissolve_chamber_desc:0 "The Chamber has served its purpose. Even in its weakened state it has still done nothing to hamper our rule and hinder our ambitions. We shall cast aside this useless relic to forge a stronger Haitian nation."

HAI_enhanced_interrogation:0 "Enhanced Interrogation"
HAI_enhanced_interrogation_desc:0 "Our regime has many enemies, with many hiding in ratholes like vermin, evading our state at every step. We shall up the ante in our interrogation techniques to better gather information from our prisoners. We have ways of making them talk..."

HAI_legislative_guidance:0 "Legislative Guidance"
HAI_legislative_guidance_desc:0 "We must guide the legislative body more thoroughly as to ensure they follow our whims and wishes. We can not allow these uppity ministers to interfere with our mission, so we shall throw them a bone."

HAI_pressure_council:0 "Pressure the Council"
HAI_pressure_council_desc:0 "The Council still stands as an annoying thorn in the side of our regime, nagging our every action as going against the wider will of the Haitian people. We could pressure these fools with force to remind them who is truly in charge."

HAI_delegation:0 "Delegation"
HAI_delegation_desc:0 "In order to maintain stability within our ranks, we will have to delegate some of our duties to others to seem less tyrannical in their eyes. If we are to keep stability and unity in the face of our many political foes, we will need to appease our own followers first."

HAI_loyal_chamber:0 "A Loyal Chamber"
HAI_loyal_chamber_desc:0 "The Chamber must be made to heel if we are to get anywhere with some shred of legitimacy left intact. We shall shackle them with lessened powers while filling their ranks with as many loyalists we can find. Our regime will no longer be hampered by its own bureaucracy!"

HAI_controlled_opposition:0 "Controlled Opposition"
HAI_controlled_opposition_desc:0 "The opposition within our nation is fierce, banded together in one large and varied coalition. We must allow this coalition to elect a new speaker, appeasing their need to spew lies about our regime."

HAI_shadow_ministry:0 "Shadow Ministry"
HAI_shadow_ministry_desc:0 "Under pressure from the Garde d'Haïti, many have called for the creation of a shadowy council led by Garde leaders and loyalist ministers who would serve as the final line of defense from Socialist and Noiriste influences infiltrating our ranks. Though it will likely anger many in the nation, the possibility must be discussed as Haiti’s radicalism problem only grows."

HAI_eliminate_dissent:0 "Eliminate Dissent"
HAI_eliminate_dissent_desc:0 "With our rule proving ever more unpopular with the angry masses of Haiti, we must stem the tide of the lies that proliferate this vitriol at its source. Dissidents and naysayers will be silenced throughout the nation, being jailed, disgraced, or worse for the particularly stubborn. We will not tolerate deceit amongst our ranks."

HAI_all_together:0 "All Together"
HAI_all_together_desc:0 "We must act as one organism, one union if we are to function as a state. All the cells within our nation need to work in unison, lest this whole house of cards collapse. Unity must be maintained, and no Haitian may be left behind. However, we can only reach out with this olive branch to one radical group, so who shall it be?"

HAI_contemporary_arrangement:0 "Contemporary Arrangement"
HAI_contemporary_arrangement_desc:0 "We must approach the radical nationalists known as the Noiriste if we are to gain any ground with their base. As their popularity grows, ours shrinks. We may need their help if we are to get anything accomplished, but they also may prove to be too dangerous to work with. We must tread carefully."

HAI_unshakeable_system:0 "An Unshakeable System"
HAI_unshakeable_system_desc:0 "We have forged an ironclad grip on the apparatus of governance here in Haiti. With our rule cemented and our foundations solidified, we shall continue to guide Haiti towards prosperity under a measured hand."

Prosperity and a true golden age for our finances and industry are just around the corner as we turn the minor gains made under President Borno into a true economic miracle."

HAI_socialist_economics:0 "Socialist Economics"
HAI_socialist_economics_desc:0 "The cornerstone of our new economic policy shall be Socialistic thought. From both the works of Marx and Engles as well as Bakunin and Pouget, we shall create a truly Red economy for the Haitian proletariat."

HAI_break_imperialist_stranglehold:0 "Break the Imperialist Stranglehold"
HAI_break_imperialist_stranglehold_desc:0 "For too long has the Imperialist scum from Europe and America tainted our island paradise with their repugnant greed. We must break the final shackles that bind us to these slave-drivers and truly free the Haitian people once and for all."

HAI_smash_coffee_barons:0 "Smash Coffee Barons"
HAI_smash_coffee_barons_desc:0 "Much of our Coffee industry is run by foreign or mixed-race masters while poor Afro-Haitians toil in the fields for nothing, echoing sentiments of a time long passed. We must seize the means of coffee production and oust these parasites."

HAI_wrest_sugar_control:0 "Wrest Control of Sugar"
HAI_wrest_sugar_control_desc:0 "Our sugar industry has been controlled by the oppressive ruling class since the first sugar plantation first opened in Haiti centuries ago. Though the French are gone, their legacy of foreign ownership over our sugarcane production and processing has not gone with them. Many foreign businessmen or White and mixed-race Elites get all the profit, and this inequality shall be dealt with."

HAI_upend_hapag:0 "Upend HAPAG"
HAI_upend_hapag_desc:0 "HAPAG stands as the main shipping giant in our waters. We must tackle these titans of industry if we are to wrest control over our mercantile interests at sea. We will no longer let these Germans dictate Haitian shipping!"

HAI_revolutionary_infrastructure:0 "Revolutionary Infrastructure"
HAI_revolutionary_infrastructure_desc:0 "Haiti needs modern rail and road systems if we are ever to fully link our nation together. Ease of travel and access fosters unity and economic growth, while also allowing our troops to relocate far more efficiently. Set our idle workers to forge new paths for Haitian citizens!"

HAI_light_of_socialism:0 "Light of Socialism"
HAI_light_of_socialism_desc:0 "A Red Star has risen over Port-au-Prince, basking Haiti in the Red light of Socialism. This new guiding star has ushered in a new golden, or crimson, age for the Haitian people, and we look eagerly towards a brighter future."

HAI_restore_frontier:0 "Restore the Frontier"
HAI_restore_frontier_desc:0 "Much of our frontier, particularly towards our border with the Dominicans, has been devastated by rampant inefficient agricultural practices and over reliance on charcoal farming. We must cease these programs at once, develop better farming strategies, and reseed the frontier to regrow the virgin forests so that Haiti’s wilderness may once again breathe freely."

HAI_petroleum_substitution:0 "Petroleum Substitution"
HAI_petroleum_substitution_desc:0 "We must follow the queues of the Syndicalist regimes in France and England and look towards fuel alternatives. We already use charcoal to light our homes and businesses, but charcoal can not power tanks and planes. Our scientists are exploring synthetic routes while our economists look for lucrative trade deals on oil and natural gas."

HAI_favor_urban_syndicates:0 "Favor Urban Syndicates"
HAI_favor_urban_syndicates_desc:0 "Syndicalism is best fostered in an industrialized and urban environment. We must cater towards these groups in order to foster true socialist enlightenment for all Haitians. Though we must never forget our agrarian roots, the way into modernity is through industry."

HAI_labor_rehabilitation:0 "Labor Rehabilitation"
HAI_labor_rehabilitation_desc:0 "Much of our labor force is still enslaved, brainwashed and deceived by capitalist filth. The minds of each and every worker shall be scrubbed clean and made to bear witness to the light of Socialism. A new class of Haitian proletariat shall rise."

HAI_domestic_processing:0 "Domestic Processing"
HAI_domestic_processing_desc:0 "Haiti will need its own processing plants to make raw resources useful if we are ever to relieve ourselves of our foreign dependencies. We need to make Haitian goods, from Haitian materials processed and extracted in Haiti whenever and wherever possible."

HAI_cultural_industry:0 "Haitian Cultural Industry"
HAI_cultural_industry_desc:0 "No matter how far we progress, we must never forget our roots. We are sons of Africa and of Kreyòl blood, we are Haitians one and all. This is in every fibre of our being and must be in every fibre of our industry and economy as well. We must never lose sight of who we are."

HAI_socialist_miracle:0 "The Socialist Miracle"
HAI_socialist_miracle_desc:0 "We have revolutionized Haiti’s economy to one that truly benefits the Haitian worker above all others. Our poorest now live happy and prosperous lives, and our economy is booming more than ever before. Lets hope this miracle continues as we walk into this new crimson age of Haiti."

HAI_focus_on_commerce:0 "Commerce Focus"
HAI_focus_on_commerce_desc:0 "Capitalism has treated Haiti well despite its foreign origins. Now with our economics and finances in our own hands and not in the hands of foreign dogs, we can create a truly fair and free capitalist paradise on our island home. For once, capitalist greed and ambition will benefit us for a change."

HAI_millionaires_row:0 "Millionaires’ Row"
HAI_millionaires_row_desc:0 "Sitting in the heart of Port-au-Prince, Millionaires’ Row is a hotbed of American activity. Filled with luxury homes packed with Mulatto and White elites and foreigners. We must look to this group as a potential treasure trove of investment opportunities and possibilities for profit."

HAI_support_private_banks:0 "Support Private Banks"
HAI_support_private_banks_desc:0 "A private banking system would alleviate the strain on our national bank and allow private capital to flow into our economy; capital we desperately need. A system of private banks shall be implemented and foreign banks expanded to further open up our economy."

HAI_haitian_hasco:0 "A Haitian HASCO"
HAI_haitian_hasco_desc:0 "We must wipe away the black mark of American influence from our largest sugar company, HASCO, if we ever want to see these profits in the hands of our people and not the Yankees. It is time for the farmers and salesmen of Haiti to run both the fields and market stalls when it comes to Haitian sugar, not some foreign parasites."

HAI_redevelop_cities:0 "Redevelop Cities"
HAI_redevelop_cities_desc:0 "The few cities that dot Haiti are lackluster and destitute compared to any modern and developed nation’s standard. We must rebuild these cities and expand them with the future in mind. New roads and sewers must be built, as well as infrastructure for electricity consumption on a far larger scale. We must turn these dilapidated and pitiful shantytowns of yesterday into the shining cities of tomorrow!"

HAI_approach_german_community:0 "Approach the German Community"
HAI_approach_german_community_desc:0 "Our nation has always held a significant German minority that has only swelled in size due to their victory in the Weltkrieg. Many find work here as agricultural landowners or in the shipping conglomerate HAPAG, making most of them quite wealthy. We could approach them and try to form closer bonds for potential economic gain given their lucrative ties."

HAI_kaffeemark:0 "The Kaffeemark"
HAI_kaffeemark_desc:0 "With our large amount of German immigrants setting up shop in our lands, some in our cabinet have called for creating the Kaffemark, a sort of special currency usable only by German-speakers in designated German-speaking zones that would be tied to the German Mark. This odd system will, in their hope, encourage more German business to come to the area, boosting our economy."

HAI_utilities_investment:0 "Utilities Investment"
HAI_utilities_investment_desc:0 "Public utilities are mandatory for a modern and successful state. Electricity, sewage, telecommunications, and more will have to be supplied to the Haitian people to drag them out of the dark ages."

HAI_negotiate_with_hapag:0 "Negotiate with HAPAG"
HAI_negotiate_with_hapag_desc:0 "HAPAG is too big a beast to take on directly, so we must play by their rules. We will meet with their representatives in order to work out a deal to the benefit of both of our parties. Haiti will get a slice of HAPAG’s lucrative network of shipyards and trade routes."

HAI_assert_financial_independence:0 "Assert Financial Independence"
HAI_assert_financial_independence_desc:0 "The strings of financial dependence that bind us to foreign benefactors hampens our domestic development. We must cut loose and set free down the road of economic independence. Haiti’s markets must not obey the whims of foreign masters."

HAI_refinance_debt:0 "Refinance Debt"
HAI_refinance_debt_desc:0 "Haiti has long been hampered by its famous, or rather infamous, debet. Colossal and crippling, it began with the French and now lies largely within the hands of Yankees. We must approach them and negotiate easier terms in order to shed this long-lasting disgrace."

HAI_restructure_bnrh:0 "Restructure BNRH"
HAI_restructure_bnrh_desc:0 "The BNRH is the national bank and the heart of our banking apparatus. However, it is overwhelmed as the only federal reserve. To alleviate this issue, the bank will be expanded and be granted additional funds diverted from new profit streams in order to further the flow of private capital into our citizens’ hands."

HAI_eliminate_disloyal_appointees:0 "Eliminate Disloyal Appointees"
HAI_eliminate_disloyal_appointees_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that much of our bureaucracy and administration’s ministers and public servants do not see eye to eye with our future goals. These troublesome appointees must be quashed if we are to succeed in our goals. Phones will be tapped, suspected dissidents fired, and more troublesome hindrances will be quietly pushed aside or eliminated. We will have order and unity. "

HAI_economic_unity:0 "Economic Unity"
HAI_economic_unity_desc:0 "Our various internal factions musn’t squabble over how best to move our economy forward. Instead, one sound policy and direction must be agreed upon for the sake of our financial future."

HAI_renewed_infrastructure_effort:0 "A Renewed Infrastructure Effort"
HAI_renewed_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "The road system of Haiti is a sight for sore eyes, with much of the nation only having dirt roads, if roads at all. Though the Americans and decades of progress have made improvements, such as in Port-au-Prince, for the most part, our infrastructural network needs attention. New roads and highways shall be built to stretch across and link our half of Hispaniola."

HAI_efficient_civil_conscription:0 "Efficient Civil Conscription"
HAI_efficient_civil_conscription_desc:0 "Our citizens are obligated to do the work their nation commands of them. We have an official system of civil conscription, but it's woefully inefficient and has shown lackluster results in recent years. We will renovate the system to provide fresh manpower for the state’s labor pool."

HAI_reduce_maritime_congestion:0 "Reduce Maritime Congestion"
HAI_reduce_maritime_congestion_desc:0 "Giants like HAPAG and Crowley Maritime dominate the shipping lanes while the American and Entente navies clog our waters, leaving nearly no space for our shipping companies to breathe and grow. We must make deals with these titans of industry while also more closely policing our sovereign waters in order to ensure our sailors take priority in our waters."

HAI_overhaul_cfc:0 "Overhaul the CFC"
HAI_overhaul_cfc_desc:0 "The CFC is a remnant of the French occupation, but a useful one, now serving as the heart of our rail network. We must modernize its equipment and infrastructure while expanding its reach so that all of Haiti may bear witness to the Iron Horse."

HAI_expand_bowen_field:0 "Expand Bowen Field"
HAI_expand_bowen_field_desc:0 "Bowen Field serves as the smaller public airport that works in conjunction with the larger military airfield nearby. We must expand the civilian hangars, terminals, and runways to better allow both public and financial traffic to flow into Haiti by air."

HAI_dam_artibonite_river:0 "Dam the Artibonite River"
HAI_dam_artibonite_river_desc:0 "Hydraulic power is a modern marvel, capable of cleanly powering entire cities through the power of flowing water. We must tap into this potential for energy production by damming the Artibonite River, the longest and mightiest river on our idyllic island. Ecological ramifications aside, this shall hopefully prove to be a boon for our nation, helping us get over our charcoal dependency for electrical generation."

HAI_rapid_electrification:0 "Rapid Electrification"
HAI_rapid_electrification_desc:0 "Much of our citizens still live in the dark, lighting the night with oil lamps and candles without a modern appliance in sight. These settings may be fitting for a backwater cesspool, but not for a nation of the rise towards modernity like Haiti. We will rapidly spread the spark of electricity across the state; every home a light!"

HAI_anti_charcoal:0 "Anti Charcoal Campaign"
HAI_anti_charcoal_desc:0 "Charcoal is the bane of our existence; just useful enough for us to nearly completely rely on it but not efficient enough to be nearly ideal. Vast swathes of land must be dedicated to its growth and production and it has taken its toll on the land. We must campaign to lessen charcoal’s usage and shift our populace towards alternative fuel sources."

HAI_fuel_importation:0 "Fuel Importation"
HAI_fuel_importation_desc:0 "With our charcoal addiction strangling our energy needs and our war machine growing evermore hungry, oil is needed now more than ever. Our island is void of the stuff, and so we must import it from foreign nations in order to utilize this miracle fluid. Let the black flow to Haiti from far and wide!"

HAI_when_our_fathers_broke_their_chains:0 "When Our Fathers Broke Their Chains"
HAI_when_our_fathers_broke_their_chains_desc:0 "What can there be more beautiful than this; children of Africa who, after three hundred years of deepest bondage cast, turned iron, yoke and truncheon against the hostile powers and against old prejudices! See from down there! It is the noble banner that unites the Blacks, who are ready to die there at the top! But no! The crowds with Lamartinière descend like foaming flood from La Crête-à-Pierrot."

HAI_embrace_noirist_thought:0 "Embrace Noirist Thought"
HAI_embrace_noirist_thought_desc:0 "Noirisme and its derivatives or sister-movements deeply flow through every facet of our state, and now so too shall the economy feel their influence. The Haitian economy shall slowly be restructured along Noiriste ideas, shifting us towards of system of racial populism for Afro-Haitians, the true heirs and children of Haiti."

HAI_munitions_export_industry:0 "Munitions Export Industry"
HAI_munitions_export_industry_desc:0 "Arms dealing and racketeering are viable revenue streams, especially in this destabilizing global climate. We should get in on the action and begin playing our role in the wider world of international weapons sales, as with war on the horizon on nearly every continent, it's safe to say there will definitely be a demand."

HAI_domestic_repair:0 "Domestic Repair"
HAI_domestic_repair_desc:0 "Much of our nation lies in practical ruin, as the effects of foreign occupation and internal strife has taken its toll. We must rebuild our industry, our neighborhoods, our cities, and our wilderness if we are to truly save Haiti and its people from the depths of poverty and despair."

HAI_black_economics:0 "Black Economics"
HAI_black_economics_desc:0 "Our newly forged economy is built on the legacy of our stolen ancestors ferried here from the home continent. This new system works for their kin, our countrymen, ensuring that no Afro-Haitian is left to rot in the ditch of despair and poverty. Haiti’s economy finally works for those that provide to it the most, and the people rejoice in their newfound financial independence."


HAI_time_of_troubles:0 "A Time of Troubles"
HAI_time_of_troubles_desc:0 "Haiti stands at a crossroads; plagued for decades with political strife and economic turbulence. Now, the Haitian people peer over the ledge into the abyss of chaos and collapse, and a path must be chosen and solidified lest this entire nation finally tear itself apart."

HAI_masters_of_dew_desc:0 "President Jacques Roumain, while also a great statesman, is also a prolific and celebrated author. His newest work, named ‘Gouverneurs de la Rosée’ or ‘Masters of the Dew’, outlines the story of a young Cuban man returning home from an overseas journey to his sugar plantation he worked on, only to find his countrymen sick and starving under an oppressive regime. Instead of rolling over, the novel’s character instead leads his fellow people into a Socialist-like system as they rebuild their plantation into an agricultural commune from the ground up. This short story may be fiction, but it reveals Roumian’s dreams for Haiti more clearly than any speech of his ever could."

Areas of natural beauty like Saut-Mautherine or archeological wonders such as Citadelle Laferrière have been declared state parks and relics needing to be preserved. Local musicians and artists have been commissioned to create new works for the state, Vodou and other native traditions have been openly relegalized and legitimized, and so on. Calixte seeks to revive the culture almost lost completely under the boot of foreign powers, and with these plans it seems he will. Let the Haitian Renaissance commence! "

However, after joining the military at a young age and becoming a marine in Haiti, his life took a turn for the strange. Saving a native queen from imminent danger, he was crowned the ‘White-Negro King of La Gonâve’, cementing his place in the hearts of the locals. With the chaos of recent weeks behind him, he now rules as King of La Gonâve and shall soon be crowned the Emperor of Haiti, echoing the legacy of Faustin I whom the native believe Wirkus to be a reincarnation of.

Seeing its usefulness and its appeal, Faustin II has declared Vodou the official religion of Haiti as well as Kreyòl ayisyen being made the national language along with French. So dedicated to his new initiative, he has even taken the time to slowly learn Kreyòl ayisyen, with the help of numerous tutors of course."

HAI_the_modern_farmer:0 "The Modern Farmer"

Under the American Occupation, many were dismantled, demolished, or otherwise left to rot. Faustin II, under advice from his spiritual council, has commissioned a new series of Hounfours to be built across Haiti in both cities and in the countryside. All Haitians shall be given easy access to their houses of worship, for no Haitian shall be denied their right to pray and give rights to Papa Legba, Maman Brigitte or any other Vodou deity, whether they be traditional or one of those added later from Vodou’s Catholic influences."

With priests, engineers, scholars, politicians, military figures, and more all being ousted, all of Haitian society has suffered. Luckily, we have a proven alternative: Vodou. Vodou has revealed itself to be the natural solution to our current issues, being an already established and widespread Haitain phenomena. Already beloved by President François Duvalier, it will be no issue fully endorsing these beliefs and spreading them further throughout the nation.

Further study shall go into the current methods to improve their efficacy and results, but it shall be kept as natural and true to customs as possible.

Holding many possible forms, he and his wife Maman Brigitte serve as the gods of death in the Haitian Vodou pantheon. Papa Doc has long modeled himself in the Baron’s image, going so far to have Samedi’s specific veve adorn most of his personal belongings and treasured items. Duvalier has even gone so far to change his tone of voice when speaking to match the voice of Baron Samedi as described in Haitian myths and has taken to wearing the dark, round glasses and hat typical in depictions of the Loa. As his rule lasts longer, Duvalier increasingly falls into this character to the point that it's near impossible to tell where Duvalier once began and where this Baron Samedi affectation now ends."

haiti.1.d:0 "For twenty long and onerous years, our so-called ‘benefactors’ from the United States pressed their boot into the people of our island nation, their black mark leaving a stain on the pristinely white beaches we call home. Under their watch, Haiti was both uplifted and downtrodden as the Americans and their puppet in President Louis Borno raped our nation’s land and ransacked our economy for their own gain, all under the false and dangerous pretense of ‘nation building’ and ‘preserving the peace.’ As the new year dawns, we find ourselves staring into a Spring in which we are not on Washington’s leash for the first time in two decades, and with our new freedom comes the potential for both great successes and terrible failures. To begin our new journey, the most pressing issues must be handled first. Chief among these new concerns would be what to do with the remnants of the American Commission, and the numerous inquiries into our State that they were administering before their hasty departure in the wake of Black Monday. Our former overlords were in the middle of conducting numerous Commissionary investigations, enacted by now infamous President Herbert Hoover, into our state’s handling of issues in agriculture, political freedoms, economic mobility, and the biggest plague of them all, our rampantly corrupt and grossly inefficient education system. While the original investigators are all long gone, their work and findings remain here, still unfinished, offering an opportunity to pick up from where they left off so that we ourselves may probe into Haiti’s myriad of issues. These half-finished reports are not all the Yankees left us however, with much of the infrastructure, administrative systems, and other bureaucratic amenities of the Commission and the occupying force being left standing and still in well-working and usable condition. These bounties have left our administration with a choice: either mothball these facilities and unfinished inquiries, relegating them to be demolished or forgotten, or pay the steep price in upkeep in order to finish these probes and renovate their facilities for our own uses."

Throwing off the yoke of our former imperialist oppressors once and for all, the proud Haitian republic can now march unhindered in its quest to drag our island home into the modern age. With nationalist groups appeased over our recent anti-American actions and the farmers appeased with their new reforms, it seems a brief atmosphere of peace has been achieved, with our administration now moving to ensure this placid state lasts as the nation carries on with its agenda."

As we continue the probes into our problems the Yankees commissioned and integrate the newly-redone infrastructure directly into the state apparatus, we shall be able to continue where they left off and further push Haiti into the 20th century. Though our confiscation of these old American assets has greatly disturbed both the nationalist and socialist radicals that chomp at the bit for their chance to strike, a placid peace has still been ushered in. Now it is up to the current regime to maintain this air of calm, lest Haiti collapse back into the fires of abnormality yet again."

haiti.3.d:0 "As our government goes about the process of reforming Haiti's nigh nonexistent Education system, the inescapable question of what to do with the various Jesuit schools that dot the Haitian landscape has finally come into full focus. These schools, run by the Society of Jesus, are one of the few places a Haitian can get a quality education, however they also taint the minds of our youth with Roman Catholicism. While the majority of the population is Catholic, the question for what to do with the schools is a highly contested issue within the halls of power. Many with Catholic leanings wish for us to begin publicly funding the Jesuit schools. They argue that with public funding, not only will the good work they do spread, but core Haitian values that spring from Catholicism will spread along with good education. Secularists and many more left leaning members of our government argue for the nationalization of the schools, perhaps maintaining the same staff but throwing out any mention of Catholicism or religion outside of historical and cultural references. A third option, supported by hardly anyone is too simply ignore the Jesuit schools, and focus on building a good public education system, saving time and money in the process."

President Borno’s recent reforms have helped him consolidate his rule while also forging a shared sense of national unity like how a blacksmith would temper fine steel. After reigning for over ten years, President Borno finally rules solidly and firmly, and finally without parroting the orders of a foreigner. Haiti shall march into its new future now unhindered by both detractors and Yankees. Though the current Speaker of the Opposition keeps amassing more influence, and with socialist and nationalist numbers increasing by the day, our stalwart state will not bow in the face of these fools.

As 1936 dawned, we had just shed the shackles of American oppression as the Haitian people withered under a decrepit and decaying authoritarian presidency. With President Borno’s recent shifts towards democratic ideals however, this withering has begun to be repaired as the fresh growth of republicanism has taken root on our island once more. With our initial reforms going splendidly, Haiti’s government hasn't been this pure and virtuous in decades, and we Haitains look wondrously towards our new destiny: one illuminated by the glow of democracy. The last of the preparations must be planned and finalized, but it won’t be long until fair and free elections finally return to our island paradise."

As the planned date draws nearer, the liberal-conservative coalition that serves as the basis of the Liberal Party must now choose an official candidate to field. This candidate will become the face of our varied coalition for years to come, and as such the choice must be made with some care and fairness.

haiti.8.t:0 "Legalize Political Parties"
haiti.8.d:0 "For years, political parties have been officially banned in Haitian politics, with their members instead organizing into groups that operate outside the official political scene. With this arrangement, these parties actively disseminate their ideals and build their strength, but are unable to actually participate in any governmental capacity. This must be rectified if we are to build a functioning democracy. We have offered amnesty to their members and declared all previously banned parties to now be legal, from the nationalist Noirists inspired by pan-Africanism and the Negritude movement to the Marxist syndicalists and other various leftist groups. Shockingly however, the Noirists have refused our invitation, instead deciding to continue to work outside the official system. The rest of the parties, from socialists to conservatives, have banded together into a semi-official coalition, echoing their previous cooperation as independent organizations. With this step, Haiti inches closer to democracy."

With them gone, we can not afford divisions to be sewn throughout our ranks, for our regime is far too vulnerable and fragile to take much more abuse. From behind our temporary facade of strength, we shall strike at the firebrands and naysayers that have derided and ridiculed the Borno regime for years. Newspapers and radio stations will be censored, offices and safe-houses ransacked, and known or strongly suspected traitors will be arrested en masse; there will be no respite. Each and every one of these enemies of the state shall rot in our nation's jail cells or be forced to toil in our many fields as penance for their action, and if any refuse to come peacefully, they will only be met with a swift and true justice. We will not tolerate these detractors and naysayers any more."

haiti.11.t:0 "The Status of the Legislature"
haiti.11.d:0 "Just weeks ago, the American Occupation that has strangled our nation for twenty years collapsed seemingly overnight as the Americans reeled in the face of Black Monday and fled home to cut spending. With our puppet-masters gone, President Borno remains as the leader of the republic, his strings finally cut from his masters. With scores of angry socialists, nationalists, and republicans decrying our administration each day, and with more and more of our general populace growing disillusioned with our rule, Haiti and its legislature stand at a crossroads. Free to govern as we see fit, and with the legislature gaining powers once more for the first time in two decades, a choice must be made: to double-down on our authoritarian ways by dissolving the chamber while also moving to uplift the Haitian people, or we could drift towards democratic principles once more, slowly transitioning the state towards a democratic future. While maintaining our grip and sidelining the legislature would appease many in the newly popular Noirist and Negritude movements, as well as the more conservative republicans remaining in the dying conservative parties, it would also inevitably garner even more hate from the various socialist groups that have exploded in popularity since the arrival of the Yankees. The alternative is no more universally popular, and the drift to democracy and reformation of the council will almost-assuredly anger these traditionalist and nationalist groups as the only competitive parties all having at least a slight-leftist slant. No matter where we take the legislature, we will be walking on glass until our many problems are resolved...or until we collapse underneath them."
haiti.11.a:0 "Re-empower the legislature and reform the council."

The program is a simple one really, but how it will be carried out is what should be most attractive. In essence all the project is is a dramatic reduction in tariffs and taxes and the like get new investors for our coffee industry. However, in order to get the attention of German investors, the government is creating a series of "Koffeemark Zones" in which the German Mark is the accepted currency and German the only language spoken. While this move is... strange, to say the least, [HAI.GetLeader] hopes it will peak enough attention to get the Kaiserreich's investors interested in the virgin Haitian economy."

haiti.13.t:0 "A Truly Haitian HASCO"
haiti.13.d:0 "Among the various relics of the American Occupation stands HASCO, or the Haitian American Sugar Company, a monolith embodying the foreign influence that has perverted the sugarcane industry on Hispaniola for centuries. As we move to continue clearing the Black Mark the Occupation left on our nation, we shall reform and rebrand HASCO to truly work for Haitian interests alone. The conglomerate has been renamed to HSCO, shedding the influence of the Yankees in our agricultural pursuits. The state shall take over general operations, with parts of it being sold off and privatized piece by piece to native Haitians as the opportunities present themselves. The sugar industry in Haiti can now breath free and expand at its own pace, finally free from the shackles of foreign entanglements."

haiti.14.t:0 "Millionaires’ Row"
haiti.14.d:0 "In addition to their occupation forces, the Americans also brought with them Yankee citizens seeking to use our island for their own various ends. The richest of these foreigners settled down in a ritzy neighborhood of high-class housing and apartments in Port-au-Prince, gaining the nickname of ‘Millionaires’ Row’ over time due to the flamboyantly wealthy residents it lured in. Not only did they bring with them their exorbitant fortunes, but also their racial intolerance, instituting a form of segregation in the areas they inhabited and enforced by both corrupt police and American marines. \n\nWith their benefactors and protectors now gone, those who have stayed instead of fleeing with the occupational forces are desperate for an olive branch. We will approach these elites and garner their support, both financial and political, in order to allow these fools to pay back to the nation that has harbored them for so long. However, we must be careful as to not let these benefactors become our next overlords, so they will be kept on a short leash."

haiti.15.t:0 "Achieving Financial Independence"
haiti.15.d:0 "With every foreign benefactor or ‘civilization builder’ that arrives on our shores to do business in our lands, the Haitian people’s pride, independence, and economy are all marked with yet another black stain, each stain further relegating us to be the mere economic playground of other world powers. This ends now! Under a slew of new financial reforms, from new tariffs and trade policies to new foreign-owned property laws and other new policies, all backdoors exploited by these vultures will be sealed, and with it, the gates to our financial independence shall open. Haiti will stand as a mere waystation in the middle of the Caribbean no longer; a new age of economic freedom will be ushered in, and our island nation will serve as a beacon to this new age. The Hatian economy will work for Haitians now, filling our pockets instead of the pockets of greasy fat cats overseas."
haiti.15.a:0 "We will break the tethers that bind us and burst free into the wider world market."

haiti.16.t:0 "Refinancing the Debt"
haiti.16.d:0 "Haiti holds the dubious honor of usually being the poorest nation in North America. Even with Borno’s mildly successful economic reforms and the ‘help’ of the Americans, our island nation still exists in utter squalor, with only the few privileged elites able to rise from the muck that ensnares our nation’s economy. Part of this poverty comes from our immense debt. First tallying up after our revolution against France, our debt has only continued to rise as more ‘benefactors’ lent us money or aid. Though much of the debt to France has been paid off in the many decades since our initial revolution from imperialism, we still owe large sums of money to the United States from the Occupation and, to a lesser extent, to the Kaiserreich, particularly over payments owed to German coffee barons and HAPAG shipping captains. Our administration has decided to reach out to our debtors and refinance our debt to lower our payments and interest rates to more favorable levels. This would allow our regime to reassess and reorganize our incredibly chaotic economic position under a less dire and oppressive situation."
haiti.16.a:0 "We shall reach out to our generous lenders and ask for a fairer deal."

haiti.1600.d:0 "As the ravages of Black Monday and the Great Depression wreak havoc on our own economy and the economies of our neighbors, many pleas for financial aid have reached our shores. Among the more interesting proposals has come in from Port-au-Prince, where the reigning Borno administration has ruled Haiti for decades with American backing. They have asked if we would be willing to sit down and renegotiate their long standing debt to our government, seeking more agreeable terms and less extreme interest rates as they seek to further rebuild their fledgling economy. Though we do not officially reign in Haiti anymore, with the Occupation ending in 1935, their financial strength could still prove beneficial to our state and our lingering business and military interests still left on Hispaniola. How shall we respond?"
haiti.1600.a:0 "We must lift these sanctions if Haiti is ever to truly thrive."
haiti.1600.b:0 "Why should we care about the plight of some Haitians? Deny their request!"

haiti.1601.d:0 "Our "benefactors" in Washington have responded to our refinancing request with a begrudging yes. They have agreed to sit down and hammer out more agreeable terms with our administration. With their help, Haiti’s economy may burst forth into prosperity as the crushing weight of our debt no longer strangles the lifeblood of our finances. Though we still have much to repay, the terms and interest rates are far more realistic for our meager but ambitious economy to manage."

haiti.1602.d:0 "Our "benefactors" in Washington have responded to our refinancing request with a crushing and resounding no. With their denial on our request to negotiate, the oppressive and suffocative debt shall continue to strangle our nation’s economy. Though this won’t be a fatal blow to our aspirations, the economic impact it will have on our finances and industry will be noticeable and crippling for some time."
haiti.1602.a:0 "Damn these economic imperialists! We must find another way out of our financial pit."

haiti.17.t:0 "Supporting the Private Banking Sector"
haiti.17.d:0 "Since the American Occupation and the rise of the Borno regime, much of the capital in Haiti has been centralized into the hands of the BRH, or Banque de la République d'Haïti, which stands as the sole national and Hatian-run bank of our nation. The only other banks that have been allowed to continue operating have been banks run on foreign capital from America, Germany, and France. To restore some good faith to our regime in the public’s eyes while also allowing for economic growth, we should begin to work more openly with these private banks. Not only would it allow more capital to flow into our economy while also appeasing the people, but it would also relieve much of the strain and financial burden of running the state off of our shoulders, reducing our spending dramatically. With the private banks working in unison with the BRH, Haiti’s financial future inches closer to prosperity."
haiti.17.a:0 "The BRH does not need to be the sole Haitian-run bank on the island any longer."

haiti.18.t:0 "Negotiate with HAPAG"
haiti.18.d:0 "The Hamburg Amerikanische Packetfahrt Actien-Gesellschaft, or as it's more commonly referred to as HAPAG, is the dominant player in international and regional shipping in the waters that surround our islands. Making our home sea their ‘Caribbean Lake’, the once successful but comparatively small company has evolved into a monolithic monopoly since their patron nation emerged victorious from the Weltkrieg. Topping the global hierarchy as one of the largest shipping companies on Earth, HAPAG’s dominance in Haiti has never been stronger, with their influence and hold over our economy continuing to grow with each successful route or order they fulfill. Too large and well-backed for us to dare tackle head on, we must go with a more diplomatic approach in order to achieve our goals. We will meet with HAPAG’s chief executives in the region and work out a deal that suits both parties. We will need at least access to their ports, dockyards, and other naval infrastructure if we are ever going to achieve any semblance of self-sufficiency and economic growth in this nation."

While on paper we may have begun to change and charge our economy, on the ground however, nothing is different. After an investigation by the relevant authorities, it has come to light that a series of bureaucratic officials in everything from the military to the education department are doing everything in their power to overturn our reforms. While not organized, and divided heavily by ideology (mostly radicals, even a handful of American holdouts) they are still a massive threat to any progress. To deal with this, [HAI.GetLeader] has authorized a great purge to deal with these trouble makers. The form of the purge is to be..."

haiti.20.d:0 "With our decision to finally deal with the Imperialist who for so long have held Haiti under their iron grasp, it has been decided by the Revolutionary Government that one of our first targets shall be the sugar industry. From the very foundation our nation, the Haitian sugar industry has been owned by foreign imperialists, European fat cats who sit their mansions, sipping tea sweetened by the fruit of the sweat of the worker. No longer shall this continue! Effective immediately, all sugar plantations are to be nationalized and returned to their rightful owners! No longer will the White Man oppress our people, no longer will the fat cats reap what they did not sow. Soon, it shall be the workers sipping tea sweetened his own fruits! As for the landowners themselves, they shall revive their just reward; They shall work until they drop dead, working the mines, the fields, growing the sugar they used without giving a thought to the ones who grew it for them."

haiti.21.d:0 "With all, or most, political parties now being free to participate in elections and the flowers of free democracy blossoming once again on our island home, our regime has now moved to completely dismantle the current and long-standing coalition of leftist, liberal, and even some of the few remaining and quickly dying conservative parties that banded together in the face of American intervention and Haiti’s slide into soft authoritarianism. With the coalition demolished, the constituent parties, ranging from Maximist and Sorelian zealots to moderate liberals and even the rarer conservatives who have not yet left their parties for the ever-growing nationalist organizations, may now pursue their own individual political agendas. Though only a handful of parties actually stand any chance of winning in a real election cycle, this air of political freedom is just another step on the road to a stable and free system."

haiti.22.t:0 "Cultural Industry"
haiti.22.d:0 "Though we must burst forth into an industrialized and modern future, we must never forget our heritage. The Haitian identity and culture goes back to when the first white-sailed ships first arrived on this island and even sooner in both our native roots here and our African blood from the home continent. Even as we erect great cities and factories and fill the air with black smoke, or as we plow these fields efficiently and for sustenance as opposed to greed, we must never stray from the identity we have fostered and built for generations. It will be woven into our architecture, our policy, our communes. It will echo in every factory and every mine. It will be sung about in hymns as our people work the fields they now all own. Our tradition must never be forgotten; we are Kreyòl, we are African, we are indigenous, we are Haitian."
haiti.22.a:0 "Our culture is our identity, it will be the backbone of our new economy."

haiti.23.t:0 "Smashing the Coffee Barons"
haiti.23.d:0 "Our incredibly fertile island is host to numerous plantations and large fields of cash crops that stretch across the landscape, but yet for all the land they use and for all the profits they make, very little if any ever reaches the Haitian people. This practice has gone on for centuries, whether the oppressor be Spanish, French, or American, with none of the benefits going into the hands of the Haitians themselves except for our brief respite of freedom thanks to Toussaint L’Ouverture and his heroics. Currently, the main offenders are rich Haitians and the remaining American and European landowners foolish enough to stay within our borders, and at the top of their hierarchy are the Coffee Barons. Coffee production, along with sugarcane, sisal, and cotton, make up the bulk of all crops grown in Haiti, leading to starvation being an ever present risk for many despite the sheer volume of land devoted to growing crops. To cut the head off this snake, as it were, our new administration, championing the will of the Haitian people, shall strike at these Coffee Barons who sit at the top of the pile and remove them from the equation of our issues. With them deposed and their lands seized by the government for nationalization and their assets redistributed to the people and into government funds, we shall take back centuries of reparations in a single stroke."
haiti.23.a:0 "The era of the Coffee Barons and their exploitation is at an end."

haiti.24.t:0 "Break the Imperialist Stranglehold"
haiti.24.d:0 "With the stunning victory of leftist politics liberating the workers and farmers of our poor island home, it is now time to strike back at our oppressors. The American Occupation humiliated our people and disgraced us beyond measure, so now we must build that pride back up. To motivate the people to take back what was stolen from them, our administration has decreed that all true red sons and daughters of Haiti may strike back at our former puppet-masters without retribution from our state. Furthermore, new state action has been planned against the largest vestiges of American influence, promising to clear out these ratnests of Yankee filth while redistributing the seized assets to the people or stashing them away in funds for future state projects. With this announcement, many of the remaining American and European administrators and elites foolish enough to have stayed here this long have fled, with the few left behind facing the ire of our people. Imperialism’s mark will be expunged from our nation forever more."
haiti.24.a:0 "We are puppets no longer."

haiti.25.t:0 "Favor Urban Syndicates"
haiti.25.d:0 "With the victory of the Haitian Proletariat over the Bourgeoisie and their imperialist backers, the time has finally come for the building up of Socialism on Hispaniola to take place. However, there is a small hindrance to the just will of the workers. To say Haiti lacked an urban population would be an understatement, and while the workers do indeed lead our new society, their numbers are fair and few between. In order therefore to both increase our urban population and the amount of workers in the few factories we do have, an ingenuous plan has been concocted. A series of reforms, most notable a litany of tax cuts, have been passed in order to sway the rural populace to begin moving to the cities. Further, preexisting worker syndicates have been granted a large amount of power and autonomy, to finally put the working man in charge of his own industry. A campaign to organize other syndicates has also begun. Slowly but surely the Haitian worker will dig himself out and build a shining beacon to the glory of Socialism for the world to see."
haiti.25.a:0 "Favor Port-Au-Prince!"

haiti.26.t:0 "Efficient Civil Conscription"
haiti.26.d:0 "Civil conscription, or the forcing of citizens to perform mandatory labor for the state, has a long history in Haiti. Even forgetting our roots in the slave trade, after our independence was won from France, native Haitians were still conscripted by the new Black-led government to carry out hard labor once done by slaves. Though it may have its moral complications to some, our state views it differently. It is part of our history, our culture, as well as being the bedrock of any stable and prosperous Haitian state. Despite its long history here, it is a woefully disorganized and dreadful business that must be modernized and made efficient. New reforms have been enacted to not only give these forced labourers better, safer conditions, but have also concriptied far more of them for our state’s use, chiefly from the many criminals that fill our jails or other lowlifes of our society. It shall be their way of redemption and our way of obtaining free labor to better suit our rapidly growing economy."
haiti.26.a:0 "It is their duty to serve."

haiti.27.t:0 "Overhaul the CFC"
haiti.27.d:0 "The Chemins de Fer de la Caraïbes, or CFC, is the largest rail line in the nation; a relic from the French imperialist regime. Since their departure with our revolution over a century ago, it has received extensions from the Germans, the French, and the Americans all in petty attempts at further exploitation and economic imperialism. With these oppressive regimes now longer calling the shots in our nation, we have an opportunity to overhaul the CFC and create a truly Haitian railway. New, modern engines will be used and the newest advancements in rail and locomotive technology will be imported for our own use, while also allowing our scientists and engineers to attempt to reverse engineer their advancements for our own purposes down the line. This new CFC will rise from the ashes of imperialism and carry the Haitian people into modernity!"
haiti.27.a:0 "All rails will lead to Port-au-Prince."

haiti.28.t:0 "Rapid Electrification"
haiti.28.d:0 "Haiti lacks many things most other nations in North America are accustomed to in this modern age, but the most glaring deficit is Haiti’s utter travesty of an electrical grid. With well under half of the nation having any regular access to electricity, and constant electricity only occasionally possible in the largest cities in the nation, much of our populace lives in the dark, relying on more archaic methods to achieve illumination, refrigeration or preservation, cooking, and many other everyday activities. This must be rectified immediately! With our abundance of charcoal, as well as the little amount of regular coal, natural gas, and oil we receive by trade, we must make a concerted effort to light up the night skies of Haiti permanently. With electricity, comes progress!"
haiti.28.a:0 "If we are to be a modern nation, our people can no longer live in the shadows."

haiti.29.t:0 "End the Obsession with Charcoal"
haiti.29.d:0 "Charcoal, or charbon in the local Kreyòl ayisyen dialect, is one of the most important industries in Haiti as, due to our crippling lack of natural oil reserves, burning charcoal amounts for nearly all energy production throughout the nation. To fuel this rampant need for charcoal, massive orchards of Mesquite, Neem, and Kasya trees have been planted across the island, consuming valuable, scarce free land with every seed sown. Though ideally cut above the roots so as to allow the tree to regrow, the quicker practice of lighting entire orchards alight at once has taken off, creating large amounts of usable charcoal that can be further dried and cured after collection in a short period of time. This practice leaves much of the land it leaves behind untillable for quite awhile, slowly eliminating arable land, while also further accelerating our deforestation as new land must be cleared while the old land rejuvenates, or when these fires spiral out of control and spread into Haiti’s few remaining virgin groves. This reckless practice must be outlawed and stopped at once to allow our nation’s forests to heal, instead being replaced with the more sustainable above-the-root cutting method until a better alternative fuel source can be found in ready supply."
haiti.29.a:0 "We must not destroy our nation’s beauty in the pursuit of short-term economic gain."

haiti.30.t:0 "Embrace Noirist Thought"
haiti.30.d:0 "The Noirisme movement’s influence is felt far and wide across Haiti as it bubbles up from multiple sources, including from various leftists across the spectrum like Jacques Roumain, Joseph Jolibois Fils, Émile Roumer, and Dumarsais Estimé, liberals like Jean Price-Mars and the union leader Daniel Fignolé, and of course the nationalists like Carl Brouard and his proteges François Duvalier and Lorimer Dennis. The movement is a strange fusion of pan-Africanism, nationalism, and populism with racial connotations with wildly varying ideological foundations, and a deep disdain for imperialism and the European-Mulatto culture that has oppressed the Afro-Haitians for centuries. This intense fusion of varied ideas is unique to our island home, and has rapidly become one of the most dominant philosophical, artistic, and political movements in the nation. The ideals championed by the Noiristes should be expanded to form the foundation for our new economic system as we seek to build an economy entirely geared towards the benefit of the mostly poor Afro-Haitians that make up the vast majority of our population, though the more liberal strains also seek to build a strong Black middleclass as well, while the nationalists are secretly split on actually fufilling this populist promise or using it to their own corrupt benefits as they continue to silently sleep with big foreign business. Regardless, with the influence of Noirisme, we shall drift further and further into a racially-based populist economy; one that, at least on paper, reaches out a hand to help the Afro-Haitians and not the foul Whites and misguided mixed breeds that have led this nation’s economy into elitist rot for so long and with it, strangled the true Haitain people."

haiti.31.t:0 "When Our Fathers Broke Their Chains..."
haiti.31.d:0 "Just under a century and a half ago, our forefathers raised their fists in solidarity with one another, marching side by side in their struggle against our old imperial masters in Paris. When our fathers broke their chains, it was not to fold their arms or watch and let their fellow brother toil under them! It was to free all Haitians and elevate them to a position of equality. Though history has played its tricks on our people, and our independence was only temporary and true equality was never achieved, the spirit of these forefathers was never forgotten. As the great Oswald Durand once wrote, ‘Independence is fugitive, without the right of equality! To plough this soil with joy, we need this strict motto: God! Labour! Freedom! ’ We shall make these righteous words echo throughout our regime. True equality shall be granted to all true sons and daughters of Haiti in both economic and political arenas, while the motto ‘God! Labour! Freedom!’ shall help form the core philosophy of our new direction. By infusing our tradition of fighting against injustice with modern concepts, such as from the Noirisme and Negritude movements, we shall create a new economic system that finally benefits true Haitians the most, particularly the most down-trodden of our kin: the Afro-Haitians. Following the spirit of L'Ouverture and Dessalines, Haiti will look to its past as it catapults itself into the future, a future all true Haitians can revel in."
haiti.31.a:0 "...This was not to fold their arms."

haiti.32.t:0 "Transform the Bureaucracy"
haiti.32.d:0 "Since the rise of our red government, we have had to deal with the incessant obstacles put forward by the various reactionary bureaucrats that still infest our nation. Even now, they further seek to rot the foundations of our new worker’s republic before we can even fully take hold ourselves, and these termites will stop at nothing to achieve their goal of toppling our state from within. This must not come to pass! All those who fill our administrative positions, bureaucracy, or who manage the civil service and affairs of the state in any way shall all be scrutinized under thorough investigation for any reactionary sympathies they may hold. True workers and proletarians have nothing to hide; only the swindlers and conmen of the Right and the Bourgeoisie have anything to truly fear. From the ground up, our entire administration will be swept from top to bottom and cleansed of any traitors to our glorious revolution, and Roumain shall lead the way!"

haiti.33.d:0 "'What are we? Since that's your question, I'm going to answer you. We're this country, and it wouldn't be a thing without us, nothing at all. Who does the planting? Who does the watering? Who does the harvesting? Coffee, cotton, rice, sugar cane, caco, corn, bananas, vegetables, and all the fruits, who's going to grow them if we don't? Yet with all that, we're poor, that's true. We're out of luck, that's true. We're miserable, that's true. But do you know why, brother? Because of our ignorance. We don't know yet what a force we are, what a single force - all the peasants, all the Negroes of the plain and hill, all united. Some day, when we get wise to that, we'll rise up from one end of the country to the other. Then we'll call a General Assembly of the Masters of the Dew, a great big coumbite of farmers and we'll clear out poverty and plant a new life.' -an excerpt from ‘Masters of the Dew,’ written and published by Chairmen Jacques Roumain, transcribed to English by one Langston Hughes."

haiti.34.t:0 "The French Model"
haiti.34.d:0 "Though once towering over a world-spanning imperialist empire, the Paris regime now finds itself as the leader of the International and of the global worker’s struggle against imperialism and capitalism; an ironic twist of fate for our former masters. With our state’s recent transition into a truly socialist government, Jacques Roumain, the father of the Haitian revolution and modern leftism in the nation, has shocked the nation and snubbed his nose at the past hatred between our two nations as he has begun to adopt more and more anarcho-syndicalist practices from the Commune of France itself. Using their model as a guideline for how to build up true syndicalism in Haiti, Roumain’s ambitions plans would see the creation of a highly centralized form of democratic syndicalism where communes and worker’s syndicates around the nation would work and maintain their own sectors internally, but would all debate and vote within one larger centralized governing body headed by Roumain himself. Though seemingly far less 'anarcho' and far more 'syndicalist', Roumain and his faction in the Haitian Syndicalist Party believe this to be the only model that will work to finally bring both stability and prosperity to the Haitian people."

haiti.35.t:0 "End the Rivalries"
haiti.35.d:0 "Harsh and venomous political rivalries have long existed in Haiti, even before the Americans came and stirred the unstable pot of Haitian politics. Socialists, liberals, conservatives, and nationalists have all long argued and debated in the chambers of our government while openly brawling or even killing each other in the streets and rural barrens after sessions end. We must mend this rift, lest our nation be torn apart in the process. New and sincere attempts at achieving a dialogue amongst these varied factions is a must, and there is one thing we can all agree on to start these needed peace talks: Haiti is for Haitians, and it must be made that way once and for all. American and European exploitation of our people has gone on for centuries, making our people weak and disgraced. This foul course must be reversed! All the parties and political groups of our nation can agree on that solid fact, and with that shared base point, future political cooperation and bi-partisanship may actually be possible. Max Hudicourt shall lead the way and help guide these warring ideological groups work together to build a stronger and more independent Haiti."
haiti.35.a:0 "At the end of the day, we all just want to help our long-downtrodden people."

haiti.36.t:0 "To Repudiate Radical Noirism, and the Haitian Négritude Question"
haiti.36.d:0 "Of all of our political enemies, there is but one we cannot ignore or work with if we are to achieve true prosperity on this island: the Noiriste. These overzealous nationalist fanatics will only cause further trouble as their divisive ideas sow divisions into our ranks. Their siren song lures the disillusioned from both the Left and the Right, and so we must cut the head off this serpent before they lure any more good Haitians to their damned cause. To confront this nationalistic siren, President Max Hudicourt must decide on one of two plans he has concocted to combat Noirisme’s influence. He could specifically single out the radical Noiristes themselves as the source of the issue, who, in Hudicourt’s words, are perverting the ideas and merits of this otherwise sound and unique Haitian ideology while using Noirisme for their own selfish pursuits. This would likely anger the radical nationalist elements of the movement on the Right and on the Left, even within the ranks of his old mentor Roumain, but would still leave the large majority of our support base made up of the non-radical masses intact, as we would still support Noirisme and similar strains as a uniquely Haitian cultural phenomena while cleansing it of its hateful taint. \n\nAlternatively, Max Hudicourt has also toyed with the idea of abandoning our uniquely Haitian thoughtform of Noirisme entirely in favor of a similar ideology that seeks unity and cooperation with all of the francophonic African diaspora - that of Négritude, or ‘Blackness’. Developed by Afro-Caribbeans and African academics across the French-speaking world like Paulette and Jeanne Nardal of Martinique, and later expanded with the help of Martinican poète Aimé Césaire, the Senegalese thinkers Abdoulaye Sadji and Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Léon Damas of French Guiana, this usually-Marxist ideology disavows colonialism, racism, imperialism, inequality, and Eurocentrism while promoting independent and revitalized African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties in order to remove any stigma against African civilization while uplifting the African diaspora to an equal position of comradery and cooperation with the rest of the world. Though the tenets of Négritude ring true alongside the similar ideas upheld by the initial Haitian Revolution, to fully embrace Négritude in favor of the homegrown alternative that is Negritude would anger many across the Haitian radical Left and Right both radicals and non-radicals alike, while fully alienating Hudicourt from his old mentor Roumain, but it would set our regime free from the radical nationalist taint of figures like Duvalier and Brouard once and for all while still allowing us to free the Black Haitian masses with help from our African and Afro-Caribbean kin without resorting to repugnant and dangerous nationalism. Regardless of our dear leader’s decision, the Noirstes shall remain to be a thorn in our side for some time until our policies and governance shows these lost and wayward sons of Haiti their way back into the flock. What shall Hudicourt choose?"
haiti.36.a:0 "A repugnant perversion of Haitian culture and pride. Turn to Négritude."

haiti.37.t:0 "Smash the Church"
haiti.37.d:0 "Religion is incredibly pervasive in Haiti, with both Roman Catholicism and native Vodou practices being incredibly common across our island nation. While religion itself is not an issue in Hudicourt’s eyes, organized religion is when it interferes with matters of the state. The Catholic Church has pressed its boot and dulled the minds of the Haitian proletariat since the first missionaries arrived on white-capped ships centuries ago. Since then, the dominance and influence of the Church has only grown, becoming one of the largest non-farmland landowners in the nation as well as sticking its fingers in our coffers as often as it can under the pretense of tithes and other unnecessary nonsense. Our people may still have their beliefs and attend their masses, but the power that Rome and the rest of the Catholic Church has over Haiti shall be stripped at once. Special tax exemptions to Church property and officials will be rescinded, active clergymen will be banned from running for public office or holding government positions, and a secularization campaign will be run by the state to cleanse all Church influence from within the current government. May our people be pious and spiritual, but may the Church never meddle in our affairs again."

Our new bureaucrats must be loyal to the nation above all else, and will be drafted from loyal civil servants and other proven workers that support our government above all others. This will occur while we actively exclude the myriad of radical groups that flank us on either side. Our new administration shall be an oasis of placidity and diligence in the chaotic maelstrom that is Haitian politics, and we will try to keep our new pencil-pushers as apolitical as possible in order to ensure their professionalism and unbiasedness in their deeply important work. They will each stand as an individual cog in a larger machine, and so each and every cog must be just right."

With emphasis on Haitian music, art, dance, food, writing, poetry, and any other facet of high or low society, this Haitian Renaissance began both in the salons of Port-au-Prince and the slums of Cap-Haitien, uplifting Haitians from across the nation and across regular socioeconomic barriers. Movements like Noirisme and Negritude were popular with many of the artists and performers, while Vodou spiritualism and ideas of "Haitianization" were common as well given their recent rises after the fall of the American Occupation. While the rest of the world readies for war or burns to the ground, for once it is Haiti that gets to dance the nights away as if not a thing in the world was amiss..."

haiti.40.d:0 "If our twinking rose of a republic for all Haitians is to survive at all, political equilibrium must be established. Much like an animal maintaining homeostasis, a nation’s government must also constantly regulate itself, intaking and outputting as needed, in order to function properly. To this end, Démosthènes Calixte has moved to reach out to all political parties within our nation to voice the need for cooperation. What is good for Haiti’s government currently is good for all Hatitans, is his argument, as Calixte’s government stands for all Haitians equally. We will do as an organism would; we will take in the good and expel the bad, taking in advice and thoughts from all sides of the aisle so that Haiti may move forward as one, while also expelling any harmful or uncooperative elements from the equation. Though it will take much time and effort before the cracks separate us are repaired or bridged, Calixte and his government are hard at work, and the results are already beginning to show."

haiti.41.d:0 "Since the rise and fall of the American Occupation, Haitian culture has been rapidly eroded under the jackboots of American Marines and Haitian traitors. With the collapse of the Borno regime and the establishment of a true democracy here in our state, a process of ‘Haitianization’ must be carried out in order to wipe the American’s taint from our lands. English will once more cease to be spoken on our island as our own dialect of Creole, Kreyòl ayisyen, takes hold as the main tongue of our nation, with the dual aims of supplanting basal French and English and driving their imperialist tongues from our lands. The Hatian gourde will be supported to rise past both the Franc and Dollar. Haitian history and culture will be taught in every classroom, Vodou and native Haitian Catholicism will be emphasized, and any other trace of our former oppressors will be wiped clean from Haiti as much as possible. Though the growing pains may be immense as we get acclimated to life on our own and as our own, we must never forget why we are doing this: we do this for every Haitian forced to toil, bleed, or die under the hands of foreigners, for every slave left to die and every servant left to starve. We do this for every Haitian robbed of their homes, their culture, their history, their lives. We do this for all true Haitans, for they above most deserve a free and sovereign home to themselves."

These affluent slobs sit atop the hierarchy of Haiti while over 90% of our nation is of African descent. The Afro-Haitians must be uplifted and given voice and power, while these false sons of Haiti must be cast out and relegated to be ruled by true Black patriots.

A staunch liberal and face of the liberal-conservative coalition that has stood as the bulwark for democracy in Haiti, Price-Mars is one of the most respected men in the nation. Much of this respect comes from his unique array of ideas he personally espouses, while also actively contributing to each movement and idea’s bodies of work. With roots and works published in medicine, ethnology, Pan-Africanism, Negritude, Afro-nationalism, and many other fields, Price-Mars is not only a valued intellectual but also a true Haitian patriot in the eyes of most people in the nation, regardless of their political affiliation. Due to his reputation and prestige, Price-Mars has become a beacon, attracting former members of our coalition who have been led astray in recent years by the siren song of radicalism. With Jean Price-Mars and other true sons of Haiti like him, our liberal-conservative alliance stands a chance at weathering this storm of radicalization and come out the other side stronger than ever."

This singular identity is all that keeps us from tripping into complete collapse, but it is no weak bond. Our national pride and heritage is stronger than steel, forged through centuries of oppression, imperialism, and chaos. Our bonds have been forged in a history so tragic many can not bear to reminisce, and with these bonds Haiti is only stronger for it. With our past behind us, we must march into the future together, not knowing what lies ahead.

As Emperor, Soulouque was renowned as a veteran of the Haitian revolution and fair ruler to the poor and downtrodden of Haito. Cleansing the bureaucracy of mixed elites and filling it with black loyalists, embracing Vodou, and creating a secret police, he ruled with a velvet fist, brutal against his opponents and fair to his people. Our noble Emperor Faustin II seeks to emulate his greatness with every waking minute, without the tyrannical reputation that tarnished Faustin I’s reputation forevermore.

From the lowliest Afro-Haitian farmer to the highest Mulatto business tycoon, all are equal and free under Emperor Faustin II. To lessen the plight of these fine people, our glorious emperor has announced a new series of reforms that will mold the Haitian state into a far more caring nation, granting support, aid, and modern amenities like healthcare and education to all true sons and daughters of our island home.

With our African-descdended brothers in the American south taking up arms, we could throw in with their cause, sending aid and troops at the least, or even possibly direct intervention on their behalf, to aid in their struggle against the tyrannical Constitutional American Republic. However, this would also cast Haitian lives to die in a foreign war, in the land of our past oppressors no less, and would most likely anger a large group of the population, at least until we enlightened them to the righteousness of the Black Belt rebel’s cause.

Even their traditional religions have flourished, with Vodou also making a massive resurgence. All of these modern ideologies and movements have mixed with the traditional native culture of Haiti, and aspects of all of these movements must be drawn from, for not only are many of their varied ideas sound and useful, but also by drawing from all of the varied native Haitian group’s ideas and traditions, we shall be able to create a truly unite and Haitian kingdom under the saviour Emperor Faustin II, the true champion of the native Haitian people."

Though these Yankees still lie in wait, heavily armed and well-trained, we must clear out these ratnests if our rule is ever to fully cement itself.

After hours of bloodshed that lasted until long after the new sun rose in the East, Duvalier’s forces stood victorious, though beaten and bloodied, over the American lapdogs. Though the fighting was fierce and dozens were slain, Duvalier survived the onslaught and called a press conference to address the nation shortly after the smoke cleared the site of the battle. Slamming his would-be assassins and their leaders Franck Lavaud and Gerald Thomas in his speech, Duvalier remarked that if these Yanks spent less time stuffing their pockets and more time training their men with real tactics and discipline, then maybe this group of armed farmers and teenage conscripts might have fared better. Though his speech wasn’t all vitriol, taking a moment to honor the legacy of the few Haitians slain as both a true sons of Haiti and true heroes of the Haitian people, Duvalier has made clear that further actions like this would not be tolerated again, and that next time, the response would not be as cordial.

By striking his fingers in multiple streams of cash flow, Papa Doc seeks to massively increase Haiti’s and his own fortunes simultaneously. Though some of his opponents have voiced their concern over the sheer amount of funds Papa Doc was diverting into his own accounts, these vocal critics soon weren’t heard from again to make much of a lasting impact on the President’s plans.

Though this has worried some, our loving President ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier has assured all that Vodou is no mere religion, but a philosophy and a science as well.

Formally known as the VSN, or Volontaires de la Sécurité Nationale, this fierce force is officially a state-sanctioned militia, but in actuality, they operate as the personal death squads and paramilitary of Papa Doc, acting as the physical manifestation of his will by carrying out only his direct orders. Earning many nicknames over their early deployments and trainings, like the Cagoulards or the Vanpirs, one sticks out among them all: the ‘Tonton Makout,’ or Uncle Gunnysacks, who get their name from the dark Haitian deity known for kidnaping and torturing misbehaving children and stuffing them in his namesake sack for later consumption. Matching the mythological figure of their name, these bogeymen either openly murder or steal away the enemies of Papa Doc, never to be seen again. What they do with their stolen victims is not officially known, but rumors of acid baths, stonings, immolations, and other horrid acts have deterred all but the most foolish to try and verify the claims. With these bogeymen at President ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier’s command, no enemy, vocal or hidden, stands a chance at remaining safe and hidden for long, for the Tonton Makout are on the prowl."

Duvalier reads and writes on many topics, but the art and science of Haitian Vodou is among his favorites. A true and determined practitioner of both the light and dark forces of Vodou, ‘Papa Doc’ has increasingly locked himself away for longer and longer periods of time, supposedly receiving visions as he performs his sacrifices, dark rituals, and black magics to pursue his own aspirations of ever-growing power. Rumors have spread that the young president has even stopped using the traditional animal sacrifices and instead has started using his many enemies and prisoners instead, while others gossip about Duvalier’s propensity to talk to himself or descend into ‘vision-induced seizures’ in certain, less-public settings, which ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier claims is him communing with his ‘Friends on the Other Side.’ Becoming seemingly deranged or unstable, some within our administration have even voiced their concern over Duvalier’s fitness to lead, but these whistleblowers always seem to disappear within a few days or weeks after making noise anyway to be much of a concern. Despite the odd looks he receives and the rumors of his unhinging sanity spread behind his back, none can deny the current successes of the Duvalier regime, which has seemingly been incredibly lucky, or blessed, in the face of the numerous roadblocks his administration has met. Whether these ‘Friends’ really do exist or not is not a question worth asking, at risk of anger ‘Papa Doc’ and becoming one of his rumored sacrifices, as long as Haiti continues this meteoric rise into prosperity."

His nurturing of Haiti’s native traditions and customs have ushered in a golden age of Haitian culture. His skills as a fiery orator and public speaker have earned him scores of new zealous followers with every new rally he holds. 'Papa Doc' holds the Haitian people in the palm of his hand, and many of the masses revere him as a god made-manifest from the Haitian people’s will and love for their President-for-life. As each new day passes, Duvalier may earn more enemies, but he earns far more new supporters and feverishly loyal followers to more than compensate.

Though their equipment is used throughout our armed forces and their training and doctrine forming the bedrock of all of our current military ideas, it has also created what essentially is a pro-American paramilitary and lobbying entity that barely heeds the word or commands of the state in the wake of the Yankees’ departure. The Garde d'Haïti lobbies for its own interests and policies only those it deems needing policing. We must reel in their influence and autonomy at once, or be forced to watch as these pro-American lapdogs further to taint our island home with the foul tainit of the Americans. The only debate that remains is how we should go about limiting their influence and to what degree. In order to get the Garde to agree to stop or limit their political lobbying, we must reach out to one of Marine Commander Russell’s personal liaisons and confidants. We can appeal to Franck Lavaud, native Haitian general, and further try to Haitianize the Garde while also slowly isolating them from foreign aid, defanging them but also making our only current military weaker. Alternatively, we can appeal to the US Marine commander Gerald Thomas who would keep open our channels and access to American equipment but also likely anger more native Haitians and further strengthen the Garde’s military strength.

Recently, with the departure of the Americans and their distaste for the 'taboo', cockfighting has once again seen a massive resurgence in our lands, with even many in the Garde partaking in the sport due to the lax in restrictions as more and more high-profile Yankees leave our nation.

Stubborn and stalwart as ever, Borno ignored all of these pleas as he strove to build Haiti insto a modern and strong state; ignored them all until now. As he sat at his desk in the presidential office, he heard a commotion come from outside his door. Within moments, his long-term colleagues and fellow Haitian patriots General Franck Lavaud and minister Paul Magloire swiftly entered his chambers, demanding his audience at once. Fearing both the collapse of their regime and the will of the Haitian people, the two old friends of Borno began to plead that Borno do the smart thing and announce his resignation, before their already tenuous grasp on power slipped further from their hands. The pair alternatively suggested the eventual return of elections, tampered if need be, to at least appease the people lest their combined ire cause the collapse of everything Borno has tried to build. Though stubborn, Borno was not a fool. Though resigning could tarnish his legacy forever, it could also be seen as a move of heroism and grace: a true Cinnicnatus! However, leaving the fate of the nation to elections and the uneducated masses was equally as daunting a proposition. President Borno, for once and finally, headed the pleas and warnings of his compatriots, and would internally debate this issue to its end. No matter his decision, the future of Haiti as a whole now rested in this final choice."

Even before the arrival of the Americanism, our democracy was prone to fraud and corruption, consistently subverting the true will of the Haitian people. This must not be allowed to stand any longer, for the people of Haiti deserve a fair and free democracy after these long years of inept governance and oppression. To alleviate some of our concerns over the coming elections and their purity, an oversight committee will be established to monitor every poll and vote like a hawk surveying its prey; not one vote will be tampered with or miscounted. The sanctity of Haitian democracy must be preserved and ensured before the first ballot is even submitted. We will not tolerate any mistakes!"

haiti.530.d:0 "As Haiti continues to drag itself up from the horrid muck of self-serving and corrupt politics, the President has called a meeting of all ministers in our government to fully discuss our plans moving forward. As our reforms continue to go into effect and as we prepare for the eventuality of free elections to all eligible Haitians, we must come together as one as to finalize a solid and unified direction for how this process shall be carried out. Though few in our varied government agree on anything, what they all can agree on is achieving what is best for Haiti, and the best way to determine what is best, is through the will of the people."
haiti.530.a:0 "Haitian democracy will not be tainted with corruption and self-serving interests any longer!"

haiti.531.t:0 "Delegation?"
haiti.531.d:0 "With the beginning of our administrative restructurings, many within the opposition coalition as well as a few of our own ministers have expressed the desire to have some powers and functions decentralized and taken back out of the hands of the presidential role and distributed amongst lower ranking officials. Many governmental functions were absconded by the president’s office during the Occupation, and with its collapse many are clamoring for a return to previous and more agreeable arrangements. Though this would take away power and influence from Borno’s hands, it would also greatly appease and empower many across the entire political spectrum. Though this would allow us some extra breathing room for more serious reform down the line, it would also strengthen the position of the Socialists within our own regime, furthering their foul taint deeper in Haiti’s heart. However, refusing this deal would not only anger the Socialists, but would also throw the more nationalist elements of Haiti, especially within the Noiristes, into an uproar as our regime continues to bow to foreign whims instead of the will of the people. Regardless of his decision, Borno will still indirectly empower one of the groups he fears most, so who shall he take the hit for this time?."

haiti.532.t:0 "Pressure the Council"
haiti.532.d:0 "The Haitian Council stands as one of the two main governing bodies of Haiti’s republic along with the Legislature, and since the rise of the soft-absolutist state under the American Occupation and eventually President Borno’s regime, both have remained in a massively weakened state. Borno has ruled without an active and influential legislative body since he ascended to his never-ending term, and the council has limped along as lapdog, occasionally whimpering in protest before being kicked down again by Borno’s regime. While weakened, the Council still tries to personify the wider will of the Haitian people, acting as an undying roadblock that seemingly always returns to be a nuisance. To officially end this hindrance to our goals, President Borno could order Garde forces to the Council’s chambers to oversee their meetings from now on, imposing his will over its members through the Garde d'Haïti and ensuring their future compliance, while also radically angering those in its chambers, particularly the Socialist ministers led by Roumain. Alternatively, he could merely send a few officers of the peace to ensure that Council meetings run more smoothly while chastising the acting ministers to actually do their jobs, or even just not act at all. This would come off less tyrannical, drawing less ire from the Leftists. But in doing so, Borno would look weak in the eyes of the Noiristes who eye our government and its practices non-stop, ever probing for further weaknesses. We are damned if we do, and damned if we don’t, so how shall Borno respond?."
haiti.532.a:0 "Send in the Garde to oversee all Council meetings from now on."

haiti.533.t:0 "Legislative Guidance"
haiti.533.d:0 "President Louis Borno has ruled over Haiti without the hindrance of an active legislature since he ascended to his current position in 1922. Though this has allowed him to rule relatively unhindered, as long as he obeyed the rare command from his American master John H. Russell Jr., this situation has also caused a great deal of instability. Democratic and socialist forces across Haiti bemoan their lack of representation, ever raising the discontent against our regime. To combat this, the legislature will be reinstated in a greatly weakened form, serving as a thin facade of legitimacy and fairness in our rule. This new legislative body would be on a short leash, easily dissolvable, and hold little real power outside, but shall hopefully dissuade the rising tide of anger against President Borno’s seemingly endless term. The final act of business is the issue of who shall be allowed within the ranks of this new legislative body and who shall be allowed to put forth new legislation to be voted on. We could ban Socialist ministers from enacting or putting forth new legislation, hamstringing their influence while drastically angering their ministers and constituents, and leaving us without their support in case the nationalists come knocking. Alternatively, we could allow Socialist to act as any other minister in the chamber may, appeasing Roumain and the Reds while deeply angering the nationalists and Noiristes under the ever more alcoholic Carl Brouard and his shining protege François Duvalier."

Just outside the doors of Haiti, thousands of angry Marxists chant their cries for revolution and revenge for the proletariat of Haiti. Led by Jacques Roumain and his wide coalition of leftists, they now stand as the likely heirs to this failed administration.

They call for the end of Haitian humiliation, and the return of our shared culture; the culture left to rot in the sun as the Americans pick the fruit of our labors from the vine. They shall soon lead Haiti, for we have failed in our duties to both preserve Haiti’s unity and to protect the Haitian people.

haiti.535.d:0 "Our legislative Chamber must be made to heel if we are ever to get a solid grip on the reigns of power again in the wake of this rising tide of radicalism. To do this, we must enchant one of the two main factions within the governing apparatus and sway them to our side to solidify our base and to defang the opposition. The two main factions are the varied Socialists in Jacques Roumain’s leftist coalition, and the remaining liberals and conservatives that form the base of Jean Price-Mars democratic coalition. If we choose to work with Roumain’s camp, we will be able to appease their ranks for now while also risking their influence which may skyrocket as more of their ministers enter our ranks. Alternatively, we could align with Price-Mars centrists. Though fewer in number, they would not carry with them the weight of the Socialist’s stigma. However, in choosing the liberals, we would no longer have the support of the Socialists, the largest faction in Haiti, who might be vital in our defense against the Noiriste militants. We must tread carefully, as nothing is as it seems as we walk this tightrope across a ravine of certain collapse, and our enemies lurk around every corner..."

haiti.536.t:0 "Controlling the Opposition"
haiti.536.d:0 "While the government of Haiti is dominated by President Louis Borno's clique, a fierce opposition force has consistently tried to block his legislation. This informal coalition of parties and ideologies, ranging from conservatives to socialists, only remains united in their disdain for Borno’s administration. To control these rabblerousers and firebrands, President Louis Borno has moved to consolidate them all under one official and state-recognized oppositional umbrella, in order to better control their opposition. Under this system, the leader of the faction, who has yet to be chosen, would serve as spokesman for the unified opposition to Borno’s administration, acting as the mouthpiece through which all criticisms and scrutiny levied against President Borno would flow through. This group would hold no executive power, in theory weakening their sway on our politics and agenda, allowing President Borno to carry out his consolidation efforts without their hindrances getting in the way. \n\nWith the coalition hammered out, all that is left to determine is who this new official coalition should nominate as Speaker of the Opposition. There are only two strong contenders in the running: Marxist author and statesman Jacques Roumain or the liberal Jean Price-Mars, famed doctor and teacher. \n\nPrice-Mars has stood as a unifying force for any liberals, moderate conservatives, and anti-socialist social democrats, who have all flocked to his side with the rise of the Noirists on the right and the Marxists on the left. Competing against him, Roumain is the founder of the newly-created Haitian Syndicalist Party, and he gained fame in his activism and resistance against the American Occupation. \n\nGoing with Price-Mars would side-step a large amount of Leftist influence that would otherwise pollute our current regime, but would leave us more exposed to the constant weathering effects of the Noirisme movement. Instead, siding with Roumain would help keep the nationalists at bay, but would also deeply increase the amount of sway the socialists hold. Which of these two titans of the political mainstream of Haiti will dictate the struggle against President Borno’s corrupt regime?"

With much of their 'Haitianess' completely missing, the Garde functions as its own lobbying group for its own interests; interests that just so happen to align with our former ‘benefactors’ from Washington, D.C. Our regime has two possible stances we can take on their hopeful expansion deeper into our nation. We can either fully allow these American lapdogs into our regime as a sort of shadow ministry, working behind the scenes to ensure our dominance over radicals. Letting these slaves to foreign interests into our nation would allow us to better survey the plethora of Socialists within our regime and government, minimizing their impact on our regime. However, this would also infuriate the Noiristes under Carl Brouard and the ever-rising François Duvalier, who see the Garde for what they truly are: thugs and traitors paid for in Haitian lives and American money. How shall we proceed?"

Only together and united have we maintained this hard existence we live, and only together shall this existence continue. However, Haiti is internally divided now more than ever with the rise of the Syndicalists and Leftists under Roumain, Hudicourt, and Calixte, and with the advent of the Noirisme movement with Brouard at its head and Duvalier in his shadow. In order to sew together the divides that have shattered this union, we must reach out to one of these groups and reconcile any sort of similarities we may share. Only with the support of one of these radical groups will we ever stand even a tiny chance at maintaining our hold on power. Whoever we align with shall grow stronger and more emboldened by this official endorsement of either group, so we must be careful with which group of extremists we shall side with."

As we finalize the last of our internal issues, we must begin to look outward once again. To the North across the blue pearl of a sea lies our old benefactors and overlords: the United States. Once the titan of the New World, the USA has seen better days and now lies in near ruin. Their weakness could prove to be our strength however, as ministers within our cabinet have moved to draft a new possible deal with these Yankees. Our administration still owes a great deal of money to their government through our infamous debt, and currently the Americans are desperate for capital. To act on this, these scheming ministers have planned to implement a final payment now, wiping the debt from our ledger forever. Our economy would offer a large, but partial, lump-sum payment to these desperate Yanks, and in exchange, they must not come knocking ever again looking for handouts from our people. Though this would, in theory, ensure the Americans don’t try to return to our shores in order to reclaim their lost investments, it would also deeply anger the Noiristes who vehemently despise any cooperation with these foreign dogs. Surprisingly, the Socialists have come out in support of the bill, hoping to preserve our future freedom for a mere monetary transaction now. What started out as an ordinary debate over a financial opportunity has now turned into an ideologically-fueled struggle. The result now, is anyone’s guess."

However, at nearly every meeting and debate these nationalists hold, one face remains ever elusive: Carl Brouard. Father of our movement and main orchestrator of the coup that brought the Noirisme movement to power, our shepherd has become ever more elusive as the reality of running a nation began to dawn on him. Falling ever deeper into his bottle, he only rarely makes public appearances at national rallies held in Port-au-Prince and other large cities, feeding off the public adoration as a temporary reprieve from his ever-deepening depressive state. Though we weep for our leader, his protege, the young François Duvalier, has been a leading figure in his stead. Though this young radical has much to learn, he has slowly begun to supplant Brouard’s role as head of these nationalists. Only time will tell how this situation unfolds, and many pray for Brouard to snap out of his state of mind and return to us as the champion of the Haitain people!"

He and his loyal Noiristes have seized total control of the apparatus of the state and have moved to quickly return a sense of stability and cohesion to the disparate Haitian people. Though his coup was quick, it was not without blood, and many bodies of both American lapdogs and Haitian sons lie dead in the dirt. With this quick flash of violence over, Brouard has moved to solidify his supposedly temporary rule, with his disciple François Duvalier and the rest of the Noiristes at his side. What this will mean for the future of Haiti is unknown, but not many trust this aging alcoholic to be any true champion of a national revival."

Struggling to stand, Brouard rubbed his head as the gunfire continued to aggravate his hangover before violently hurling up whatever bile was left in his stomach in the closest wastebin and walking towards his kitchen. Opening the only cabinet with anything in it, Brouard grabbed another bottle of liquor and some bread to pad his acidic stomach for another day’s worth of drinking for his 'creative process.' Walking back over to his desk, he grabbed his pack of cigarettes and lighter from the table as he waltzed by, lighting a new one and taking a swig of vodka as he retook his seat at his perch. As the burning liquid and smoke flowed into his body, life was returned to this dead-man-walking, who began to type away at his next great poetic ‘masterpiece.’ As the sounds of gunshots continued from outside as Noiriste militants continued to wage war against Syndicalist insurgents, the Father of their movement hid away in his crypt, further falling into the bottle as his protege Duvalier amasses more and more power for himself.

As our official leader has fallen into the bottom of the bottle, drinking his way into a near-coma at every opportunity, Duvalier has instead led the people of Haiti to victory over the spectre of Syndicalism. Many have begun calling for François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier to supplant Brouard as leader of the nation, though Duvalier has denied and decried these suggestions as traitorous to his old friend and mentor.

This tenuous situation is near its breaking point, with even his long-time protege Duvalier questioning Brouard’s ability to lead. His old student and friend has demanded that ‘President’ Brouard finally make a decision: either truly live up to his promise to being the saviour of Haiti by reinstating democracy, or try to maintain this juggle for total power and hope the house of cards does not collapse. If the Noriste mission is ever going to survive, stepping down may be the movement’s only hope, as a barely-functional drunkard will likely not be left to rule for much longer and his forceful removal would only further tarnish these ideals we hold so dear.

In their intense rivalry and clash of ideologies, further intensified over the collapse of their deep friendship and artistic cooperation, these two titans of Haitian radicalism have evolved into their extremes. While Brouard has retreated further into the depths of alcoholism, leaving more of his duties to his subordinates with every drink, Roumain has instead done the opposite of his reclusive old friend and projected his anger and pain outwards, coalescing into his now infamous bursts of near-sadistic action against his most hated foes: the Noiristes. With the devolution and degradation of Roumain’s founding principles and ideals, his protege Max Hudicourt has risen to take the torch of the people’s will. Hudicourt, through acts of valor and bravery, has proven himself to the Haitian people and our revolutionaries, who now follow his word over the fallen titan that is Roumain. The old Master has been run out of Port-au-Prince and was last seen heading to the docks with a small retinue of his most loyal followers, likely bound for Paris or some other Syndicalist stronghold. Meanwhile, Hudicourt now leads the Red revolution as he continues their struggle against the Noirste rebels."

Just weeks ago, he and his brave revolutionaries seized the apparatus of the state, and the means of production, saving the Haitian proletariat from the gaping maw of nationalists and plutocrats. With the last pockets of Noiriste and democratic insurgents being cleared out by our loyal militias, Roumain’s power-grab has been solidified, rooting this new regime to Haiti’s foundations. Under Rouman, Haiti’s future shall be prosperous and free under the Red Star of Syndicalism."

While the ruling regime under Borno desperately tries to mend the situation with shallow legislation and empty platitudes, these radicals wage war in the streets and fields of our once placid nation. Locked in a bitter struggle, the leader of the Socialist front, Jacques Roumain, has resorted to increasingly abhorrent tactics against his nationalist foes, who then returned in kind, further accelerating this vitriolic civil strife. If this revolution continues to go on, many fear that Roumain will stoop to unthinkable levels to achieve his ultimate goal. In the meantime, his long-time protege and friend Max Hudicourt has increasingly appeared as the softer and more noble alternative to his old teacher, increasing his support with each new heinous act Roumain and his forces commit."

In Borno’s stead, a new interim junta has been established to guide the nation as it races for its first free elections in decades. However, though united in purpose, this new regime is filled with varied parties from military men to Borno’s loyalists, thus this temporary administration requires a fresh face to serve as its unifying figure. The main candidates to rise to the top of the list have been General Franck Lavaud of the Garde d'Haïti and minister Paul Magloire, loyal conservative under Borno’s tenure as president. Should we go for the more stable option in Lavaud, who is far more experienced and measured but also more likely to anger the masses of Haiti, especially the radicals, or shall we go with Magloire. Though Magloire is still young and inexperienced, at least he does not bring with him the stigma of the Garde d'Haïti. The final choice must be decided soon, as the Haitian people need a new face to rally around in these dark and uncertain times."

It seems that over these past few years, titans of the Haitian left Jacques Roumain and Max Hudicourt, once close friends and colleagues, have now broken their long-lasting partnership as Hudicourt has established his own Socialist party. Criticizing his old teacher as a tyrant, Hudicourt seeks to usher in a new Socialist future for Haiti, one far less centralized and far more democratic than Roumain’s ideals. Splitting the massive leftist Parti Syndicaliste in two, Hudicourt now leads his La Réaction Démocratique party in a hopeful race for the presidency.

Normally this situation is tumultuous but civil, but recently the Dominican Republic’s ruling regime has repeatedly espoused and promoted anti-Haitian rhetoric and has sent troops and police into the border zone to enforce their idea of ‘peace.’ \n\nEven worse, there have been reports from the Haitian worker hovel-town of Monte Cristi in the border region that Dominican security forces have begun to impose harsh policies against our Haitain laborers, and some have even been beaten or killed.

Even better, the Haitians have offered to be assimilated into the West Indies Federation, under the conditions that it be allowed to change the name of the new state as it sees fit and that the capitol be moved to Port-au-Prince. Granting this request could help stabilize the region, and allow us to focus our thin resources elsewhere, but we could also lose our grip on the area in the process. Preempting our hesitation, the Haitian delegation has already offered to further tweak the deal to further suit our interests. They have offered to grant both the Algiers Regime and our administration here in Ottawa full and sovereign control of Suriname and French Guiana, and Guyana respectively, returning these lands to their former colonial masters directly. On top of this, they have also offered to have the West Indies’ navy leave port immediately and set sail for Canadian waters in order to return to our proud command; an enticing offer given our improved state making it no longer necessary to leave the Exiled navy separated.

With our regime now raising its mighty flag across this verdant archipelago, we now eye the last eden of Kreyòl culture still left languishing under foreign control: Lwizyana.

A strange and stern request from Haitian president François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier, noted Pan-African nationalist autocrat, has arrived on our desk. In a strongly worded ‘request’ letter bordering on a demand, this ‘Papa Doc’ has asked for our regime to transfer administrative rights and control of Louisiana in the name of "Pan-African cooperation and Kreyòl unity" in the words of the Haitian dictator. We could fulfil this request, cementing cooperation between the two prominent majority-Black states in the New World, and relieving ourselves of the headache of Cajun rebels and Longist remnants.

Though many in our nation detest this idea, particularly many within the Noiristes and other traditionalist groups throughout the nation, giving women the ability to vote now would greatly legitimize our democratization campaign in the eyes of the masses, allowing our first real elections since the rise of President Borno to truly represent the will of all voting adults in Haiti.

Today on my way to the studio where we broadcast these talks, I happen to pass by the beach where I saw young, happy and healthy children playing and building sandcastles and playing at war. We also happened to pass by the beautiful Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption, who's glorious bells where ringing for the Angelus. Why am I telling you this, my most loyal subjects? Well, the situation that our nation finds itself in is incredibly similar. Before you dismiss me as crazy, hear me out. The glorious Haitian Empire we have brought back from the pages of history is like a sand castle. Our government stands as a beacon of stability, economic normality and moral betterment, built from the ground up. You, the Haitian people are the sand, from which we are building the sand castle of the state. While indeed the sea may wash away and clear the sand, it only makes the resolve of the builder the stronger. Now take those who stand against the Imperial revival, the Socialist, the Republican, the radical Norist. They are like the cathedral; what they are is beautiful and what is within is glorious, but they grow stagnant. Cathedrals don't stand forever, the buildings are only temporary, and when they are destroyed as all things are, they are nigh impossible to repair quickly and cheaply.

Long thought dead to the wider Haitian public, Papa Doc has kept him hidden away in his darkest prison, eagerly waiting for the most opportune time to rid himself of his predecessor. As the Bogeymen dragged the beaten, bloodied, and unconscious body of the former president, Papa Doc followed, taunting his barely-alive adversary as blood continued to pour from nearly every orifice on Borno’s pulped face. \n\nFinally Duvalier and his retinue had found themselves at their final destination, standing atop the upper scaffolding and walkways of this old rendering plant, hovering dozens of feet above large vats of unsettlingly placid, clear liquid. Papa Doc had his loyal death squad tie Borno up by his feet, hoisting him high above these ominous tanks of fluid. Long a tactic used by Papa Doc and his Tonton Makout, what laid below for Borno was a fate worse than any death he could have imagined, for the only thing that awaited Borno at the bottom of his fall was a few hundred gallons of sulfuric acid. Though Duvalier would rarely ever go through all the trouble of this executionary theatre, normally just dunking his tourture victims in much more manageable barrels of the vitriolic substance, he felt the famed Lapdog President of Haiti only deserved a death equally as thrilling as Borno’s reign and treachery to the Haitian people. So, with a final taunt to his old foe, Papa Doc threw the lever that shall drop Borno to his final and befitting fate, staring the beaten and frightened man in the eyes one last time..."

Prone to mishandling his medications, or ignoring them to use Vodou remedies instead, Papa Doc is frequently in altered states of mind, falling into catatonic states and even suffering from a minor heart attack or two. Oftentimes, he claims to receive visions during these periods of bodily weakness, as he reportedly communes with the Loa so that he may obey their whims and wishes. His most recent mishap was a disastrous one, with an insulin overdose sending him into a coma for days, leaving leader of the Tonton Makout Clément Barbot and Papa Doc’s right-hand man Lorimer Denis to temporarily rule in his stead. Though Duvalier has since recovered, he claimed to receive a vision from the Loa that Jacques Roumain, the venomous Syndicalist snake who had evaded the Tonton Makout’s search parties, had transformed into a mangy, black dog and now roams the Haitian wilds free. Acting on this ‘divine inspiration,’ Papa Doc has ordered that all black dogs in Haiti be found and killed, no matter if they are stray or owned.

In response to this to this clear act of foreign intervention into Haitian affairs, President Duvalier has declared that any priest, bishop or archbishop who refuses to swear allegiance to him, and him alone, must be thrown out of the country. Further, all Church property, regardless of location, has been nationalized. Several of these confiscated churches have been turned over to local Vodou houngans, mambos, and bokors to give them a more fitting place to carry out their divine rituals. Catholic nations around the world are decrying these actions as tyrannical, and even the United States, although engulfed in political turmoil has joined in the condemnation of this "violation of religious liberty.""

Starting in artist’s communes and poetry circles in the Afro-Haitian slums of Cap-Haïtien, or Kap Ayisyen in Kreyòl, it has since spread outwards into other major cities in Haiti from Port-de-Paix to Les Cayes, bathing the nation in a new golden age of Haitian renewal. The movement has so grown to even capture the attention of famous artists, musicians, and writers of the African Diaspora, like Langston Hughes, Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Chandler Owen and many more, all contributing to and helping to spread the results of this newfound fountain of inspiration erupting within Haiti.

However, unlike the original ban, Duvalier has extended these restrictions to also hold true against Multatto elites who can be proven to be at least half-White. Though a larger group than White-Haitians, the Mulattos still are dwarfed by the Afro-Haitian population which accounts for over 95% of the population.

He asks why he would do something so dangerous, especially when he knows the risks. He goes on to demand that Faustin publicly repent and denounce this occultist and pagan religion. The Emperor of course, has no intentions of denouncing Vodou. Instead, he is responding to the Pope on the flip side, explaining that he is simply using Vodou, and that not all of it is of the devil. He is even requesting the creation of a "Haitian Rite" to allow the excise of those parts of Vodou that Faustian claims are spiritual good. Well definitely not a theological work, and clearly the work of a layman, if accepted by His Holiness, Faustian's letter may just be one of the most important pieces of Catholic literature in the 20th century."

haiti.80.d:0 "As was expected, the so-called Emperor of Haiti has sent a letter, responding to His Holiness. Faustin has indeed explained himself, saying he is simply using Vodou to legitimize his rule, and that not all of it is of the devil. Unexpectedly however, he has requested the creation of a "Haitian Rite" to allow the excise of those parts of Vodou that Faustian claims are spiritual good. While definitely not a theological work, and clearly the work of a layman, he lays out his case with a very good sense of clarity and obvious respect for the man whom it is addressed to. If accepted by His Holiness, Haiti would be one of the few cases where Latin Rite Catholicism is not followed to a tee. As with all cases regarding faith and morals, the choice belongs the Pope, and to the Pope alone."

While this is not unexpected, as Faustin was asking for quite a lot, it is still a saddening move. Regardless, The Emperor has resolved to not let this set him back.

Not having to work fields or toil in factories like the worker’s he so clearly has dedicated his life to, Hudicourt now has begun to follow in his own Master’s footsteps. Using his party, the PSP, for resources and assistance, Hudicourt has established his own school of sorts where he seeks to train the next generation of Socialist thinkers for Haiti Meeting with young, promising intellectuals, including Tony Bloncourt, Jacques Stephen Alexis, René Depestre, and Max Chancy, among others, Hudicourt hopes to foster Socialist thought for generations to comes. He shall be the new father and master of a whole new era of Haitian Socialism, all influenced by himself and his own views."

haiti.83.t:0 "The Haitian Rite of the Catholic Church"
haiti.83.d:0 "Following the Pope's acceptance of the Emperor's proposal, the Catholic Church has officially created the 'Haitian Rite.' While the basis of the Rite is the normal Latin Rite, it is highly modified. Unlike the normal Latin Rite, the Haitian Rite is prayed in Creole, but that is perhaps the smallest of the changes. Every single Hunopher has been consecrated, thus meaning they are valid places to say the Mass. Many preexisting parishes have in essence been retrofitted, to look more like Vodou Hunophers, the most notable change being the replacing of the traditional altar with a Potomitan, or 'central pole' in which the mass is said. Along with this, drums and other such instruments are also used during the opening and closing hymns. Further, several references to saints have been slightly modified to fit with their veve counterparts. Most controversially, female vodou priests have been give the right to read from everything save the gospel which is still reserved solely for the priest.\n\nWhile these changes are still new and ongoing, it is the hope of both the Imperial government and Church authorities that the Haitian Rite will in time completely overtake Vodou. Despite this, not all are happy with the changes. Already more traditional theologians are calling this move by the Holy Father heresy, or an embracing of Paganism. Several protestant groups are calling it proof that the Catholic Church is a pagan religion. Regardless, it seems Fustian II's attempts to use Vodou as a way to catholicize Haiti have proven successful."

haiti.84.d:0 "Though our liberal-conservative coalition is large and varied, one man still stands at the center of it all - Jean Price-Mars. An odd combination of anti-elitist populist and staunch conservative when it comes to the Haitian people and their traditions, Price-Mars has been able to find common ground with groups no other centrist in Haiti could ever dream of reaching. His interests and beliefs are varied, nuanced, and entirely developed through his own keen intellect and sharp mind. Trained as a teacher and an ethnologist, he takes great care in documenting and preserving Haiti’s innate culture and uniqueness, pioneering movements such as Negritude and Noirisme. His career and life’s work is a beacon that has de-radicalized much of the Haitain political extremes while fostering a greater sense of unity and cooperation among our peoples, a cooperation never seen before. He is the true father of a modern and free Haiti. He works from within the coalition with all of his colleagues as true equals in his eyes, together bettering his companions while they intrun better Haiti at large. Together, under Price-Mars and other figures of unity like him, like Louis Déjoie and Stenio Vincent, Haiti’s democratic traditions and liberal ideals are safe, as are its traditions and historic ways of life."

An autobiographical piece about his own political and military career, the novel gives detailed insight on key moments in Calixite's life, as they happened, from living through Papa Doc’s attempted grab at power and saving Haiti from nationalist radicals, to serving under the American Occupation as a cavalry officer as he was forced to grapple with loyalty to his position and loyalty to his own people. Though some critics have called it airy or vapid, much of the public has openly adored this rare view into their leader's life, and the book has sold out across the nation.

The two have frequently collaborated on literary works and philosophy before, bantering and bickering back and forth due to their opposing ideological mindsets. However, their love of Haiti, their shared culture, and their dedication to movements and ideals such as Noirisme and Negritude have solidified their bonds past the point of being broken by mere disagreements on economics. However, as time passed and the realities of Haiti’s political strife had been made more apparent, Roumain had to accept the truth: no matter how close these two creative legends were, nothing could prevent Haiti from achieving its destiny with Roumain at its helm. With this realization, Roumain knew what had to be done. With Carl Brouard serving as the face of the Noiriste radicals, their past ties now only would lead to suspicions amongst his fellow Reds. Roumain would have to silence his old friend, once and for all. Knowing Brouard was usually in his apartment, drinking away his woes and stress, Roumain had ordered his loyal militias to murder the poor man, painlessly, in his sleep; as fair a death he could give to his old compatriot. He now sat at his desk, awaiting word back from his men that the deed was done, sipping on rum from the last bottle his dear, yet dreadfully alcoholic, friend had left him when last they met, reminiscing on better times."

Languishing under Spanish explorers, French slave drivers, and most recently, American Marines and businessmen, the people of Haiti have experienced more of their history under the boot of oppression than not. \n\nThe Americans were the latest ‘benefactors’ to grace us with their presence, first stealing away our sovereignty in 1915. For 20 long and arduous years, these Yankees and their lapdogs ruled over the Haitian people with an iron grip, with their most dedicated puppet being the current president, Louis Borno, who was enstated by the American occupiers in 1922. Since then, Borno and his backers from the United States have made meager improvements to Haiti’s wider economy and infrastructure, though most of the profits from this growth goes directly into the pockets of Borno’s American friends. Furthermore, Marine commander John Russell rules the Garde d'Haïti, Haiti’s only standing military force, using it as a paramilitary and lobbying group for Washington’s interests. However, their dominance could not last... \n\n With the Great Depression and internal strife forcing the bulk of the American occupationary forces to leave our shores in the winter of 1935 in a maelstrom of panic and chaos, Haiti now teeters on the edge of collapse as internal factions and radical movements seek to tear Haiti apart for their own nefarious purposes. To the Left, Jacques Roumain and his protege Max Hudicourt clamor for the end of Borno’s tyranny so that a Red Tide may wash over our island home,while to the Right, Carl Brouard leads his power-hungry student François Duvalier and rest of the nationalist, Pan-African Noirstes clamor for a complete reformation to Haitian society, shedding it of all foreign influence. Weathering the storm in the Haitian Center are moderate titans like Jean Price-Mars and Stenio Vincent, and there are even rumores some within the Garde d'Haïti itself too plot for their chance at power. \n\nHaiti now stands at the edge of its destiny, and all that it requires now, is a push in the right direction..."

Once called the Cagoulards, or hooded men, and the Milice Civile, the people of Haiti know them only as the Tonton Makout, and their leader is just the man Haiti’s army needs to help raise it from the ashes of their former glories. Clément Barbot, head of this personal paramilitary, has long served Papa Doc and his regime, with he and his brother Harry being instrumental in securing Duvalier’s rise to power as leading figures in the Noiristes military wing. Never opposed to nepotism nor rewarding those loyal to him, Papa Doc has declared that Clément Barbot be promoted to be the newest field marshal of Haiti’s armed forces, becoming both the leading figure in Haiti’s official and less-legal military branches. Though his appointment jumps over the possible promotion of many other valuable, proven, and experienced military men that could lead our armies, Papa Doc values loyalty over all. By granting him this high position as an official government figure, Duvalier hopes to keep Barbot and his growing ambition in check, allowing him to both expand and improve Haiti’s armed forces without letting this possible snake slip from his sight."

haiti.89.d:0 "In the early 1930’s, August Derleth - famed American fiction author and one of the most promising ‘Lovecraftian’ writers - travelled to our vibrant and culturally rich island of Hispaniola in order to delve into Haitian traditions. While here, he traveled the Haitian countryside and through every inch of our villages and cities in search of fascinating facets of our native mythologies and spiritual ideas to incorporate into his own writings. Learning about the Loa of our Vodou faith and on stories of Witch Doctors and Oungans, the tales that really piqued Derleth’s interest were on local accounts of the undead, and that is what has made him return here now. \n\nIn Haitian tradition, there are beings known as the Zombi. Bokor - or Haitian dark priests that are in opposition to the Oungans - supposedly create these ‘undead’ Zombies by taking the ‘ti bon ange,’ or half of Vodou’s idea of a dual soul that controls free will, and placing it in a bottle, allowing the Bokor to control the victim after death, for the ti bon ange can then manipulate the ‘gros bon ange’ - the second half of the dual-soul that controls the body. The beings created are mindless husks, completely enslaved to the will of their master, being mindless and feeling no pain or general emotion. They are created, then fed a poison created from the local wildlife that makes them appear dead, so that their loved ones bury them and move on. The Bokor then exhumes these ensnared slaves for use as personal servants while the family believes them to be dead, leading to the impression that outsiders of Vodou hold that Zombies are truly the living dead, such as in the curious and famous case of Clairvius Narcisse - a young Haitian man who claimed to have been turned into a zombi, with his story being covered by Harvard-graduate and ethnobotanist Wade Davis. \n\nAlways finding the idea of this practice and the wider Vodou faith deeply interesting, Derleth has returned to our island paradise once more to further write more on the subject. The beloved author is a friendly face, and our nation has done its best to be welcoming in order to save face with the world. Now, as Derleth walks Port-au-Prince and wider Haiti in search of the spark of inspiration once again, we keep an eye on this foreigner from the shadows. Regardless of what he finds, Derleth is sure to enjoy himself among the palm trees and tropical breeze of our cultured tropical oasis."

These radicals have begun to doubt the will of Emperor Faustin Wirkus, and instead have rallied their support around one ‘Prince’ Joseph-Faustin d’Haïti, who stands as the true heir and descent of the original Emperor Faustin of the Second Hatian Empire. These zealots wish to see the current monarch be replaced by who they declare is the true heir to the ancestral throne, but our current administration has many loyalists who resist this position.

The flag we wave currently was the same flag used by Faustin I, but in the eyes of many, it has become tainted by the false White Negro Emperor Faustin Wirkus. These detractors instead suggest that we adopt the flag and identity of one of Haiti’s older monarchist movements. The most likely option would be to use the flag of the first Anpi an Ayiti that was formed and led by great Haitian hero Jean-Jacques Dessalines.

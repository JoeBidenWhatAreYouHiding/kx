### Leaders ###
POLITICS_TRIBHUVANA_DESC:0 "King Tribhuvan ascended to the throne of Nepal at merely five years of age. Tribhuvan, however, was born king in name only, in reality, the boy-king was nothing more than a figurehead for the powerful Rana family. As he has grown into a man, Nepalese politics have become increasingly defined by the antagonistic relationship between the king and the Ranas. Time alone will reveal the victor of the struggle both politically and economically."

### Events ###

nepal.5.t:0 "Passing of Tribhuvan Shah"
nepal.5.d:0 "After a period of illness, the king of Nepal, Tribhuvan, passed away this very morning. He is succeeded by his son, Mahendra."
nepal.5.a:0 "May he rest in peace."

nepal.6.t:0 "A Change of Pace?"
nepal.6.d:0 "While our remote kingdom in the Himalayas has not been directly hit by the aftermath of what the Westerners have dubbed as the 'Black Monday', it has nonetheless been yet another nail in the coffin of the established order around the globe, with no exception the Indian subcontinent. With what has formerly been the British Raj shattered in 1925 and the remnant states being held in a certain limbo the Rana Dynasty has continued to run Nepal the same way as it has for the last century. However, as the fallout of the events in Berlin have galvanized the forces around India, signalling a coming storm, some within the Regime have demanded that King Tribhuvan use the rights given to him within the Pajani System and appoint a new Prime Minister. Of course, as the title is pretty much hereditary to the Shumsher Rana Dynasty, or the so-called Satra Bhai (17 brothers) there are only three realistic choices.\nThe first option is to keep the current Prime Minister, Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, a definition of status quo yet still knowing that Nepal needs to receive slight development lest the people finally raise their arms against the Family. The second is Mohan Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, a hardliner that believes any kind of reform meant to liberalize the system would only result in societal breakdown, and worse give more powers to the 'inexperienced' King. The last option is Padma Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, seen as untrustworthy by the other Ranas because of his reformist leanings and grander designs that would shake the status quo, ones which have nonetheless earned approval from the ordinary people of Nepal.\nDespite the choice belonging to King Tribhuvan, he is still bound by the power wielded by the Dynasty and knows that going against the choices provided would spell immediate doom upon his already precarious position."
nepal.6.a:0 "Safe status quo remains, keep Juddha."
nepal.6.b:0 "Hardliners come out in force, appoint Mohan."
nepal.6.c:0 "We need some reforms, appoint Padma."

nepal.10.t:0 "Nepal Winning the War"
nepal.10.d:0 "Impossibly, the Nepalese Gurkhas have streamed out of the mountains and are turning the tide against us. Perhaps the time has come to give in to their demands and sue for peace?"
nepal.10.a:0 "Yes, let's end this now"
nepal.10.b:0 "No, we can still turn this around!"

nepal.11.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace with Nepal"
nepal.11.d:0 "Amazingly, the Nepalese army has outmanoeuvred us. [From.GetNameDefCap] has sued for peace and given into their demands, to at last put an end to our humiliation."
nepal.11.a:0 "Unbelievable!"

nepal.20.t:0 "Stalemate in War with Nepal"
nepal.20.d.claims:0 "Our war with the Nepalese has ground down in the mountains, territory they are far too adept at fighting in. Perhaps we should sue for peace - they can give us our claimed territories and walk away now, and we will abandon our efforts to conquer them. Surely they know that, given enough time, we would win... but at what cost?"
nepal.20.d.noclaims:0 "Our war with the Nepalese has ground down in the mountains, territory they are far too adept at fighting in. Perhaps we should sue for peace and just walk away from this, before the battle drags on for too long."
nepal.20.a:0 "Yes, let's end this now"
nepal.20.b:0 "We will ask [faction_leader.GetNameDef] to negotiate a peace"
nepal.20.c:0 "No! We will take Kathmandu or die trying!"

nepal.21.t:0 "Peace with Nepal?"
nepal.21.d.claims:0 "The war with the Nepalese has ground down in the mountains, territory they are far too adept at fighting in. Envoys from the [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us and asked that we sue for peace - the Nepalese can give them their claimed territories and walk away now, and the [Root.GetFactionName] will abandon efforts to conquer them. Surely [NEP.GetNameDef] knows that, given enough time, we would win... but at what cost?"
nepal.21.d.noclaims:0 "The war with the Nepalese has ground down in the mountains, territory they are far too adept at fighting in. Envoys from the [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us and asked that we sue for peace - the [Root.GetFactionName] would surely win in the long term, but at what cost? They say the war isn't worth pursuing further."
nepal.21.a:0 "Then let's end this now"
nepal.21.b:0 "The war doesn't end until Kathmandu falls"

nepal.22.t:0 "Peace with [From.GetNameDef]?"
nepal.22.d.claims:0 "The war with [From.GetNameDef] has ground down in the mountains, as we knew it would, but we are a long, long way from victory. Representatives from the [From.GetAdjective] government have suggested we hand over the claimed [claimant.GetAdjective] territories and walk away now, our independence intact."
nepal.22.d.noclaims:0 "The war with [From.GetNameDef] has ground down in the mountains, as we knew it would, but we are a long, long way from victory. Representatives from the [From.GetAdjective] government have suggested we end the war and walk away now, neither side having gained anything but our independence intact."
nepal.22.a:0 "Yes, let's end this now"
nepal.22.b:0 "Absolutely not!"

### Ideas ###
NEP_gurkha_brigades:0 "Gurkha Brigades"
NEP_gurkha_brigades_desc:0 "Gurkhas, known as Gorkhali in Nepali, are both a collection of ethnicities and the terms used for fearsome soldiers famous in all of India and beyond. Wielding their signature weapon, the khukuri, Gorhka troops have excelled as the core of special regiments created for very particular missions. As modern Nepal has been created after the Gorkha Kingdom unified the fractured realms we can claim the true right to call the brave Gurkhas our own."
NEP_kingdom_within_kingdom:0 "Kingdom within a Kingdom"
NEP_kingdom_within_kingdom_desc:0 "The Rana Dynasty, a force which has dominated Nepal with an iron-fist for almost a century, were granted the lands and title of the Maharajah of Lamjang and Kaski in 1856, 10 years after their ascension to total power within the Himalayan kingdom. These 'Great Kings' have not only ensured that contemporary Nepalese politics are subservient to them, but also that if anything was to happen which would aim to unseat their rule their personal fiefdom of Lamjang and Kaski State would provide more than a formidable fortress to stage a defiant stand against any status quo changes."

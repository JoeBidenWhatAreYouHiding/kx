 nepal.1.t:0 "Nepal in 1936"
 nepal.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Nepal, unified by the great Prithvi Narayan Shah, has long found itself a rather unique state compared to its nearby neighbours. Although subjugated by the British like its Indian counterparts, it still managed to maintain a great deal of autonomy owing in large part to the well renowned voracity and bravery of its troops as well as an intentional policy of isolationism. This autonomy would even see official recognition by Britain of its independence in 1923, becoming the second state in the region to achieve such a feat, and the first to do so through diplomacy unlike Afghanistan.\n\nNepal's governance has also long set it apart from its neighbours, as although the kingdom may on paper be ruled by the Shah dynasty who founded it, for almost a century now the nation has been ruled by the Rana dynasty through a hereditary dictatorship. Functioning much like the Japanese Shogunates, the Ranas truly rule Nepal through the office of Prime Minister, with the king acting as a highly respected figurehead who simply rubber stamps their orders. Although Rana rule is much resented, both by the general population and the King himself; their policies of brutal repression, economic stagnation, and steadfast mutual support with Britain has historically seen all opposition to their rule snuffed out almost as soon as it began.\n\nWhen chaos erupted in India with the outbreak of their Revolution, Nepal quickly found itself embroiled in the conflict in support of their British allies. Although Nepal was not a direct battlefield itself, thousands of Gorkha troops were sent to fight directly under the British, as well as those under the Prime Minister's command being sent to defend the border regions where they remain to this day. The failure to defeat the rebels, alongside the collapse of their primary ally, has left the Nepali state in a very precarious position, with the government in Calcutta openly hostile to the Rana regime. With support from [BHC.GetNameDef], anti-Rana rebels, chiefly the Nepal Praja Parishad, have begun to form in the years since the ceasefire, with hopes of overthrowing the Ranas and establishing a free nation aligned with Calcutta. Only time will tell whether their dreams will come true, or whether the Ranas and their British allies will crush both of their enemies and further cement the Prime Minister's iron fisted rule."
 nepal.1.a:0 "Woven from hundred flowers, we are garland Nepali."

 nepal.5.t:0 "Passing of Tribhuvan Shah"
 nepal.5.d:0 "After a period of illness, the king of Nepal, Tribhuvan, passed away this very morning. He is succeeded by his son, Mahendra."
 nepal.5.a:0 "May he rest in peace."

 nepal.6.t:0 "The Future of the Ranas"
 nepal.6.d:0 "While our remote kingdom in the Himalayas has not been directly affected by the recent instability across the globe, it has nonetheless put another nail in the coffin of the previously established status quo within Nepal. Just as the Rana Dynasty continued to prepare itself to hold the real reins of power for another century, the caged monarch Tribhuvan sensed an opportunity to break free from his shackles. Ultimately, he failed, and with the shuffling of influences in the capital we now stand before a new opportunity to direct the future of the nation. It’s in no small part thanks to the Pajani System – granting the ability to appoint a new Prime Minister - of course within the constraints of the position being pretty much hereditary and reserved to the Shumsher Rana Dynasty.\n\nDespite being called Satra Bhai (17 brothers) there are only three realistic choices. The first option is to trust in Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, a definition of status quo combined with tacit acknowledgement that Nepal needs to receive slight development, lest the people finally raise their arms against the family. The second is Mohan Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, a hardliner that believes any kind of reform meant to liberalize the system would only result in societal breakdown, and worse, give more power to the 'inexperienced' ranks. The last option is Padma Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, seen as untrustworthy by the other Ranas because of his reformist leanings and grander designs that would shake the status quo. Nonetheless, he has earned much approval from the ordinary people of Nepal."
 nepal.6.a:0 "Safe status quo is the way, support Juddha."
 nepal.6.b:0 "Hardliners come out in force, support Mohan."
 nepal.6.c:0 "We need some reforms, support Padma."

 nepal.100.t: "Nepal Petitions for Faction Membership"
 nepal.100.d: "The Government of the isolated Mountain nation of Nepal has reached out to our embassy in hopes of securing an alliance between Nepal and [ROOT.GetNameDef]. After much journeying from Nepal's isolated peak at the top of the world, these emmisaries have brought word of [NEP.GetLeader]'s desire to form this historic pact. While we are always happy to have new brothers in the struggle of the [ROOT.GetFactionName], Nepal's relative isolation and situation sandwiched by two geopolitical blocs has made some wonder if inducting Nepal into our alliance may be more trouble than it's worth."
 nepal.100.a: "Accept them at once!"
 nepal.100.b: "We can't even find them on a map..."

 nepal.101.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refuses"
 nepal.101.d: "Our offers to join [FROM.GetFactionName] have fallen on deaf ears in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where diplomats were scarecely aware of our nation's existance. Leadership in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have waved us off, thinking our small nation as either too much hassle for little gain, or in one hurtful instance, thought our delegation was part of an elaborate practical joke. With this hurtful rejection, we must re-consider our options in the affairs of geopolitics; even if some think that our best option is now to retreat back into our nation's self-imposed isolation."
 nepal.101.a: "Terrible."

 nepal.102.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts"
 nepal.102.d: "Our offers to join [FROM.GetFactionName] have been accepted at once. Diplomats in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have toasted to the newfound alliance between our nations with the finest alcohol, celebrating our kinship with a grand feast in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. While we may remain a world apart from [FROM.GetNameDef], our shared values have ensured that once and for all, our nations shall stand side-by-side in unity as we struggle for a common goal. In a speech to their constituents, [FROM.GetLeader] hailed Nepal's ascencion to their alliance as the beginning of the downfall for the nation's many enemies."
 nepal.101.a: "Our Gorkhas shall make quick work of [FROM.GetFactionName] Enemies."
 
 nepal.200.t:0 "The Ghorkas Rise Up!"
 nepal.200.d:0 "Instigated by our foe to the north in the form of Nepal of all places, Nepali Ghorkas in Darjeeling have begun to rebel against our rule en masse, rising up against us in order to bend the knee to the Nepal! How this came about, we have no idea, but it is vital that we respond to this blatant act of war immediately!"
 nepal.200.a:0 "Let them go, they’re not worth the fight."
 nepal.200.b:0 "To war!"
 
 nepal.201.t:0 "Nepal Requests Darjeeling"
 nepal.201.d:0 "Our allies in Nepal have requested the return of territories in Darjeeling. Already Nepali Ghorkas in Darjeeling have begun to rebel against our rule en masse, making some wonder if transferring this land to Nepal is worth the hassle. Should we give them the territories they claim is rightfully theirs?"
 nepal.201.a:0 "Let them go, they’re not worth the fight."
 nepal.201.b:0 "Not a chance."

 nepal_events.1.t: "Arrest of Dasharath Chand"
 nepal_events.1.d: "Ever since the regime in Calcutta began to consolidate their rule, they have taken every opportunity to fund insurrection against the Nepalese state in an attempt to turn it into a loyal puppet, perhaps even with eventual plans for annexation. The so-called Nepal Praja Parishad, or People's Council, has been one of the primary groups receiving backing from the Republic in their attempts to incite revolution in Nepal, and despite their relatively recent founding they have managed to gather a startling number of supporters in high places.\n\nFor now however, Calcutta will have to begin the search for a new snake to send after us, as luck would have it that the group's second in command Dashrath Chand Thakuri was arrested today in a raid against the Parishad's membership. While the raid did not specifically seek out the man himself, it is a welcome surprise; and one that if fortune favours us should leave these rebels running around like headless chickens, scrambling for new leadership."
 nepal_events.1.a: "Another rebel dealt with."

 nepal_events.2.t: "Whispers from the Palace"
 nepal_events.2.d: "Despite hopes of the Parishad fading away with Chand Thakuri behind bars, reports have worryingly suggested that the group has become more active than ever, potentially seeking to act quickly before the rest of their leadership meets the same fate. Even more worrying however, are the whispers coming out of the palace regarding the King's personal trainer Dharma Bhakta Mathema. Mathema has long been under suspicion by the Prime Minister, as the man was once directly connected to the groups now running the government in Calcutta, yet there has never been anything concrete to pin against him.\n\nThe recent rumours however have done little to assuage suspicion against the man, with staff from the palace reporting overhearing rather seditious sentiments being expressed to the King in moments believed to be private. One of the servants has even gone so far to claim that the King even agreed with these sentiments, allegedly believing something had to be \"done\" about the Prime Minister. While we have little concrete evidence except the rumours of servants, hardly compelling on its own when their eavesdropping is already almost paramount to treason, it is hard to not feel paranoid about what poison is being whispered in the King's ear..."
 nepal_events.2.a: "Even if true, the king poses little threat."

 nepal_events.3.t: "Rumours from Calcutta"
 nepal_events.3.d: "Compounding further on the increased activity of the Parishad and the unsettling gossip from the palace, we have now received scattered reports regarding events in Calcutta of an even more dire kind. Intelligence from the rightful Indian government in Delhi informed us last year of plans by the Calcutta regime to launch strikes against them, hoping to reignite war on the subcontinent, although these plans were shelved following a disastrous probing attempt against the Dominion's borders. Now they have informed us that these plans have seemingly been reactivated, and even more concerningly Nepal itself has been factored into the equation.\n\nWhile not a fundamental part of the invasion plans, their agents have claimed that a meeting has been held in Calcutta with the Nepalese insurrectionists, including Parishad leader Tanka Prasad Acharya and socialist leader Ram Prasad Rai, in regards to the Nepali question. Allegedly an alliance between the two was tabled, hoping to build a united front against the Ranas, and launch a revolution against us as the first domino to bring down the Dominion's influence over the subcontinent. Although the outcome of the meeting is not yet known, with the reports suggesting it to be inconclusive at best, this is clearly the most organised the revolutionaries have been since their insurrection first began, and as such must be dealt with as harshly as we can before it festers even further."
 nepal_events.3.a: "Worrying."

 nepal_events.4.t: "The Darjeeling Conspiracy"
 nepal_events.4.d: "It seems that the prior reports of the insurrectionist meeting being inconclusive was too good to be true, as news from the border town of Darjeeling have confirmed our worst fears. An alliance has been struck between the Parishad and the socialist Labour Swatantra Party, now operating under the umbrella name of the Mukti Sena, the Liberation Army. They have openly declared their intentions to bring down the Rana dynasty, through whatever means necessary, aided by their comrades who \"wish to see the unshackling of Nepal\".\n\nThis news has caused a wave of fear in Kathmandu, with all loyal members of the Rana dynasty rallying around the Prime Minister Juddha Rana. The King, following the Prime Minister's advice, has publicly declared his confidence in the government in attempts to quell this rebellion, although it is unlikely to cause much impact with his obvious insincerity. With this alliance between the rebels, and their full backing now of Calcutta, it seems obvious that this \"Liberation Army\" will stop at nothing to see the end of Rana rule over Nepal, and they must be crushed, unless perhaps such revolution is desirable."
 nepal_events.4.a: "The Ranas must be overthrown."
 nepal_events.4.b: "The realm stands behind the Prime Minister."

 nepal_events.5.t: "The Darjeeling Conspiracy"
 nepal_events.5.d.DEH: "With rumours and reports abound of increasing militarism in the regime to the east, it is no surprise to hear that Calcutta has now begun to openly organise insurrection against the government of Nepal, one of the few states still friendly to us in the region. The Nepalese government, led by their Prime Minister Juddha Rana, have aided us significantly in the past, and now they have turned to us to seek help in crushing this insurrection before it festers any further.\n\nThese rebels, operating under the name of the Mukti Sena, or Liberation Army, wish to oust the Ranas and restore the Nepalese king to power, an outcome that at best will leave them neutral and at worst will give the Republic a new ally to wage war against us with. We cannot afford such an outcome, and we must aid our friends in Kathmandu, who hopefully will then be in a position to aid us in return when Calcutta inevitably attempts an attack against us."
 nepal_events.5.d.BHC: "Not long after Huq was first appointed Chairman, a promising young man from Nepal named Tanka Prasad Acharya managed to arrange a meeting with government officials, seeking support in overthrowing the tyrannical Rana regime and restoring the Nepalese king to power. Despite our disapproval of royals of any kind, the choice was made to back this man, as the Ranas have long been a steadfast ally of the British, and breaking their grip over Nepal would deprive Delhi of the Gurkha troops that they have become so reliant on. Acharya, alongside his allies, now lead the primary opposition to the Rana government in the Nepal Praja Parishad, and with our backing have grown to be a formidable force against the Ranas.\n\nRecently however, the group's second in command, Dashrath Chand Thakuri, was arrested by the Rana regime, and the Parishad subsequently came running to Calcutta to seek further support to fill the void left in his wake. As per an agreement we reached with Acharya, his organisation have formed an alliance with more socialist inclined Nepalese revolutionaries based in the Republic, who are now operating together under the united banner of the Mukti Sena, or Liberation Army.\n\nWith Operation Thunder back on the table, we have sent the Mukti Sena back into Nepal in hopes of igniting revolution against the pro-British Ranas, with the ultimate aim of installing a friendly regime in Kathmandu to aid us against Delhi. We must ensure their success, lest we wish to have a front to the north when the bell finally tolls for the remnants of British rule."
 nepal_events.5.a: "We cannot afford to let Nepal fall."
 nepal_events.5.b: "Nepal must be liberated from tyranny."

 nepal_events.6.t: "Rumours of Smuggling"
 nepal_events.6.d: "Despite the ongoing tensions with the Republic meaning our mutual border is much more heavily guarded, it seems that unfortunately our men cannot be everywhere along it at once. Over the past few days there has been scattered reports of a small party crossing the border around the Gandaki, having slipped past any guards, pulling a rickshaw behind them. Rather surprisingly however, all of the reported sightings so far of the entourage have dismissed any concerns of it being arms or other military equipment from Calcutta. Instead they seem to claim it to be machinery, with the most solid guess as to what it is being a printing press.\n\nThe confirmation of this smuggling not being guns for the rebels has put the army at ease, with no one currently being sent to hunt down these men and their rickshaw, but it has overall imparted a great deal of confusion as to why they'd go through the effort. It isn't exactly illegal to bring a printing press into Nepal, censorship hasn't yet gone that far, and so the best guess that has been tabled is that these men are thieves trying to fence a complicated looking object they managed to get their hands on.\n\nStill, while this act of smuggling can probably be chalked up to petty theft, the fact they were able to manage it means that it could easily next time be guns or explosives. The guard along the border must be increased, and those currently stationed at this crossing will be getting a stern talking to at a minimum."
 nepal_events.6.a: "We need to redouble the border guard."

 nepal_events.7.t: "Seditious Newspapers Distributed in Kathmandu"
 nepal_events.7.d: "It would seem that we have finally received an answer to the mystery of the smuggling operation a few weeks ago, and it is not the answer we were hoping for. Over the past few days it seems that wherever you turn in Kathmandu, you have been able to find a copy of the Janata Patrika newspaper from Calcutta, filled with seditious and treasonous claims about the Prime Minister and his family. Accompanying this filth has often also been a pamphlet from the Nepal Praja Parishad, taking claim for the entire operation and declaring proudly their threats against the nation:\n\n\"Rana Dynasty! You must know that the Nepal Praja Parishad was established with the aim of liberating and freeing the Nepali people from your cruel clutches, educating them in pure knowledge, honouring their race, earning wealth and religion, and making them one of the civilized races of the world, and making the pride of their country echo in every direction for thousands of years\".\n\nWhile these papers are unlikely to have much impact, with most of those literate enough to read them simply confused by the material, the fact we allowed this to sneak past us is a rather embarrasing affair. The lack of tracking of the printing press once it had been identified means we do not currently know where it ended up, which would have potentially exposed the Parishad's operations. All we can really do at this point is decide how to react to what has already been distributed, with the Prime Minister especially wanting those responsible hunted down with as many resources as we can spare."
 nepal_events.7.a: "Burn these papers, and hunt down their printers."
 nepal_events.7.b: "This load of tripe isn't even worth a response."

 nepal_events.8.t: "General Burathoki Meets with the King"
 nepal_events.8.d: "Recent rumblings in the palace have caused major worry amongst the Prime Minister's closest advisors, as General Giri Prasad Burathoki has been arranging an unusually large number of private meetings with the King over the past few weeks. Despite the General's important role as one of the few commanding officers in Nepal to have seen combat, having fought with the British Indian Army in the Indian Revolution, his subsequent disillusionment with them that saw his return to Nepal has often left many wondering if he holds any revolutionary sympathies.\n\nWhile no one but the King and the man himself know what has been said in these meetings, there is great suspicion that the General has potentially been compromised by the rebels, and is now attempting to wrangle the King into the plot as well.\n\nIf these rumours are true, and the rebels have the backing of key generals, then all steps must be taken to stop their influence growing any further. It would however be impossible to take action against the general just based off rumours without possibly making things worse, but unofficially blocking him from any further meetings would be a reasonable course of action. We must also keep in mind that we are operating entirely off hearsay, and the man could be completely innocent, and shutting him off could cause unneeded friction for little benefit."
 nepal_events.8.a: "We shouldn't overreact to rumours."
 nepal_events.8.b: "Put a ban on any such meetings in future."

 nepal_events.9.t: "Wave of Arrests in Pokhara"
 nepal_events.9.d: "For once the Prime Minister has been able to awake to good news about the rebels, as a wave of arrests have been carried out in the city of Pokhara by those attempting to distribute Parishad pamphlets. Until now, the rebels have primarily been operating in the area around Kathmandu and the regions to its east, and as such this was clearly an attempt to begin expanding their insurrection to the rest of the nation. Fortunately for us however, a group of strange men arriving in an unfamiliar city attempting to hand out pieces of paper is the type of action that would make any local suspicious. Very quickly these rebels found themselves handed in and arrested, where if they're lucky perhaps they will simply sit in a cell for the rest of their lives, or until a hangman is available if not."
 nepal_events.9.a: "Another batch of rebels dealt with."

 nepal_events.10.t: "Expanding the Army Provident Fund"
 nepal_events.10.d: "The ongoing rebellion has left many in the government in an extreme state of tension, a state which one could potentially call paranoia as long as they're out of earshot of the Prime Minister when they say it. While previously any rebellion against the state would be crushed before it even became a concern, the Indian backing of this one has made it a genuine threat; and as government paranoia continues to multiply the fears over how far reaching their conspiracy could truly be have similarly multiplied.\n\nThe recent private talks between the King and General Burathoki have laid the seed in people's minds that any part of the Nepali state can be compromised, especially the army, and if the army is compromised then stopping any revolution may become impossible. In hopes of dissuading these fears however, it has been suggested that proactive measures be taken to keep the army on side, or win them back if they have already been compromised.\n\nA few years ago the Army Provident Fund was set up as a pension scheme for soldiers, where soldiers pay a percentage of their salary into the pension fund to ensure they are still provided for post retirement. This scheme has done wonders for the public image of the Ranas amongst the armed forces already, but it has been suggested that perhaps a further expansion of the scheme, with a direct contribution from the state's treasuries to the final pension payouts, could be just what is needed to cement their loyalties even further."
 nepal_events.10.a: "Allocate a few extra funds, it'll pay off in the long run."
 nepal_events.10.b: "These bribes are not worth the cost."

 nepal_events.11.t: "Raid in Birgunj"
 nepal_events.11.d: "It seems that the amount of guards deployed to the border after the smuggling incident was nowhere near enough, as today a raid against the armoury in Birgunj was carried out by Mukti Sena men arriving from the Republic. Two guards at the armoury attempted to stop the raid, finding themselves shot to death by the brigands, with the armoury's stockpile of rifles seized and the rebels getting away unscathed as far as all reports can verify. While these guns were primarily just Gahendra rifles that had been phased out and permanently stored away, as is government policy on old equipment, they are likely still going to find a use in future raids against us, and the overall situation is a great embarrassment all around."
 nepal_events.11.a: "Find those men, immediately!"

 nepal_events.12.t: "Attempted Mass Suicide Prevented"
 nepal_events.12.d: "Despite the high profile nature of actions by the Mukti Sena against the government, it is important to not forget that they are not the sole threat against the Prime Minister, and other likeminded groups are liable to conduct their own forms of treason against Nepal. In recent years a group primarily of women led by one of the few female ascetic in Nepal, Yogmaya Neupane, has slowly become a thorn in the side of the government. While at first Neupane was seen as a more tolerable form of opposition, primarily just pushing the Prime Minister for reform through an appeal to Hinduism that could be placated with token concessions, she has become much more openly hostile to the state itself rather than simply the systems within it.\n\nOver the past few months, ever since our fight against the Mukti Sena began to escalate, she has gotten more and more bold with her demands, threatening to self immolate herself to spark revolt against the regime. These were clearly not empty threats, as today her and her followers attempted to see through the threat, only being stopped by guards sent personally by the Prime Minister moments before the pyre were to be lit. Dozens of women, along with just under a dozen men, were arrested for taking part in this incident, with the men shipped off to a jail in Dhankuta and the women imprisoned in the Radhakrishna Temple.\n\nWhile the men who took part in the incident are likely to remain behind bars for a long time for their treason against us, the fate of the women is not so cut and dry. The temple they are being kept in is unlikely to be suitable for long term detainment, but there is nowhere else suitable to keep them, and keeping women imprisoned for potentially years upon end is a bad look no matter how treasonous they may be. It has been suggested therefore that we simply let them go after a few days, and keep a close watch to prevent any future incidents. There is however no guarantee they won't find alternative measures to frustrate the state once they are free again, and as such it may be worth keeping them locked up as long as we can instead."
 nepal_events.12.a: "Give them a few years behind bars, that'll put them in their place."
 nepal_events.12.b: "Let them out after a few days, they pose little real threat."

 nepal_events.13.t: "Jaya Singh Criticises the Prime Minister"
 nepal_events.13.d: "While Nepal recognises only one great king, his majesty Tribhuvan, who rules over all the lands of Nepal, many of the petty kingdoms that united under Prithvi Narayan Shah's banner still operate as vassals of the realm to this day. The Prime Minister himself, along with his predecessors, is styled as the Maharaja of both Kaski and Lamjung, having been granted these titles upon the establishment of the dynasty's rule. Of these kingdoms however, none has been as troublesome in recent years than Bajhang, and its former Raja Jaya Prithvi Bahadur Singh.\n\nAs Raja, Singh found himself constantly bouncing between ally of the state and enemy of it, rising initially to prominence during the short reign of Dev Shumsher Rana as the nation's strongest advocate of education reform; and as such being forced into exile when Dev was ousted for his reformism. While he would later reconcile with the new Prime Minister, Chandra Shumsher Rana, his opposition to support for the British in the Great War led to a second round of exile, self imposed this time in India. When the revolution in India kicked off, he began to support the war effort through providing medical care for the Republic's wounded, and his humanist and reformist views have seen him become a notable figure amongst Calcutta's political moderates.\n\nOperating now from Calcutta itself, and objecting to the apparent \"brutality\" of the Prime Minister in recent months, Singh has held a speech calling for an end to Rana rule and for Nepali \"freedom\". This speech, having allegedly been arranged by government figures in the Republic, is unlikely to have any direct impact on the Mukti Sena, but having such a notable figure come out against us is certainly a poor look. If news of his speech spreads to Nepal, it could potentially cause quite a bit of reputational damage, necessitating a censorship campaign, although the costs of carrying it out may not be worth the hassle with how little influence he has over Nepal these days, even in Bajhang itself."
 nepal_events.13.a: "Nature will deal with this insolent old man soon enough."
 nepal_events.13.b: "Censor any spread of this slander in Nepal."

 nepal_events.14.t: "Assassination Attempt Against Baber Shumsher"
 nepal_events.14.d: "Even with the constant attacks against the Nepali state, few could have expected the Mukti Sena to stoop as low as they have today.  While on his way home today, the Great War hero Baber Shumsher Rana had a bomb thrown towards his doorway in an attempt on the man's life. Although the bomb failed to detonate, one of the would be assassins pulled out a pistol and fired at Baber, hitting him at least twice. Leaving the general for dead, these men tried to flee the scene, but were thankfully shot dead by soldiers responding to the gunshots.\n\nBaber himself, while gravely injured, has fortunately survived, and soldiers have been stationed throughout Kathmandu to protect all notable members of the Rana dynasty from further murder attempts. Enraged by this act of barbarism, the Prime Minister has declared that the government will stop at nothing to exterminate this rebellion, making clear that no clemency will be granted to any rebel, and that soon all of them will meet the same fate they attempted to inflict upon Baber."

 nepal_events.15.t: "Conspirators on the Move"
 nepal_events.15.d: "It seems that the assassination attempt against Baber was simply the first shot of the revolution, as the Dominion's agents have reported to us the slow gathering of Calcutta trained troops across the country's border.\n\nThroughout Nepal itself, whispers of armed men moving swiftly in the dead of the night are commonplace, with the army being order to begin to prepare for the worst."
 nepal_events.15.a: "Nepal's future is at stake."

 nepal_events.16.t: "Conspirators on the Move in Nepal"
 nepal_events.16.d.DEH: "Our agents, operating throughout the Republic, have begun to report back to us about gathering troops across the Nepalese border, seemingly preparing for hostile action. While alarms began to immediately sound regarding this also signalling invasion against us, we have seen little movement elsewhere, suggesting that Calcutta intends to solely move against Nepal for now.\n\nIt is likely that soon these troops, alongside their allies within Nepal itself, will attempt their planned revolution against the Ranas. We have already sent word to Juddha Rana, and all we can do now is prepare for them to make their move."
 nepal_events.16.d.BHC: "Despite our recommendations against doing so, our Mukti Sena allies in Nepal attempted an assassination attempt a few weeks ago against a prominent member of the Rana dynasty, ultimately failing to kill the man. Since then the Nepali government has escalated as far as they can go in their crackdown without actively sending troops across our border, and the Mukti Sena have recognised that they are left now with little choice but to act.\n\nThose operating from our territories have now begun to amass in critical position across the border, while those in Nepal itself have begun to organise themselves in key positions, all now preparing to at last launch their revolution against the Ranas."
 nepal_events.16.a: "We must aid our allies as much as we can."

 nepal_events.18.t: "The Nepalese Revolution"
 nepal_events.18.d: "Striking all across Nepal, quickly taking Pokhara in the west and Hetauda in the south, what the Mukti Sena expected to be a bloody war across the entire nation ended being more of a whimper, save for the siege of the capital itself. Following a declaration by the King, dismissing Juddha Rana as Prime Minister, and a further declaration to the army to stand down, few actually stood to challenge the rebels as they began to secure control of the country. Those still loyal to Rana rule primarily retreated to the capital, led by General Ekraj Shumsher Rana, hoping to turn the tide; or at the very least make a valiant last stand.\n\nHaving faced little opposition, Mukti Sena troops led by Subarna Shumsher Rana on the Parishad's side and Kunwar Singh on the LSP's side began to besiege the capital within a few hours of the uprising beginning. Fighting between Ekraj's troops and the Mukti Sena continued for the rest of the day, becoming quickly obvious the Ranas were outnumbered and outgunned. Rather than fight to the death, government troops finally stood down near sunset, surrendering themselves to the rebels. In the early hours of the following morning, once the dust had settled, the King's arrival to meet the rebel leaders was greeted with loud cheers, with discussions soon to begin about the formation of Nepal's first free government."
 nepal_events.18.a: "Nepal is finally free!"

 nepal_events.19.t: "Loyalty to Calcutta"
 nepal_events.19.d: "With the Rana dynasty now overthrown, and former Prime Minister Juddha Rana having reportedly fled the country, a new government will be quickly needed to restore order. Rather unsurprisingly, the King has moved to appoint Tanka Prasad Acharya, the leader of the Parishad, as the nation's new Prime Minister; tasking him with building an interim government and setting Nepal on the path to democracy. Operating on orders from Calcutta however, the LSP have declared that they will refuse to support the government unless they are placed in charge to lead a socialist state loyal to their benefactors.\n\nWhile we can likely resist their influence and still appoint Acharya, it may be prudent to simply give in and align fully with Calcutta for protection against the Dominion and further instability."

 nepal_events.20.t.BHC: "The Nepalese Revolution Succeeds"
 nepal_events.20.d.DEH: "Today's news can only be described in terms like disaster, or by using a long string of expletives. A revolution has taken place in Nepal, ousting our friends in the Rana dynasty, and empowering a bunch of Calcutta aligned radicals. Despite their inferiority to the Nepali armed forces, the rebel troops were able to seize control with little resistance due to the King's personal backing of the revolution, hoping to oust the Ranas who have kept his dynasty in chains for almost a century.\n\nAlthough Juddha Rana and some of his men have managed to flee across the border to us, we have lost a valuable ally, and even worse we may now gain an enemy if Calcutta manages to install their most ardent loyalists in Kathmandu."
 nepal_events.20.d.BHC: "Wonderous news has been relayed in from Nepal; the Mukti Sena have seized control of Kathmandu and all remaining forces loyal to the Rana dynasty have surrendered, with most of the army standing down on orders of the King. The only sour part of this news has been the reports that the ousted Prime Minister managed to escape, fleeing with a few remaining loyalist to the Dominion, although with the current warplans he is unlikely to elude justice for that much longer.\n\nMore importantly however, the Nepali king has called together the leadership of the Parishad and our allies in the Labour Swatantra Party to discuss the establishment of a new government, and as such we may hopefully soon be in the perfect position to sway these discussions in our favour."

 nepal_events.21.t: "The Future of the Nepali Government"
 nepal_events.21.d: "With the Rana dynasty now overthrown in Nepal, and former Prime Minister Juddha Rana having reportedly fled the country, a new government will be quickly needed to restore order. Rather unsurprisingly, the Nepali King has moved to appoint Tanka Prasad Acharya, the leader of the Parishad, as the nation's new Prime Minister; tasking him with building an interim government and setting Nepal on the path to democracy.  While we can count the Parishad as an ally, their lack of commitment to the international socialist cause means that they will almost certainly steer Nepal towards a path of neutrality and capitalism, even if they may be outwardly friendly towards us.\n\nIf we wished to do so, we could easily instead install our allies in the LSP as sole rulers of Nepal, fully bringing it under our thumb, and guaranteeing its support against both our enemies in India and our future foes across Asia. Such a government is however unlikely to be stable, and almost certainly decades away from actually implementing what anyone could charitability call socialism, and as such it may be prudent to allow them to stay neutral under Acharya instead. Whatever happens though, our extreme influence over Nepal means that it is our choice to make in the end."
 nepal_events.21.a: "Allow Nepal to choose their own destiny."
 nepal_events.21.b: "Install a loyal government in Kathmandu."

 nepal_events.22.t: "Chaos in Kathmandu"
 nepal_events.22.d: "At a meeting with the King a few days ago in preparation for the uprising, Parishad leader Tanka Prasad Acharya made a request to Tribhuvan to openly back their revolution against the Ranas in hopes of avoiding bloody fighting between the armed forces and the rebels. Fearing that the Mukti Sena were too weak to take power, the King refused his request, hoping that they would simply delay the revolution until a more suitable time. In what is retrospectively a poorly judged move however, the Mukti Sena still launched their uprising regardless. What has followed has been bloody battles across the nation, with cities like Birgunj falling quickly to the rebels before being retaken by government troops in a deadly firefight.\n\nNo fighting has been as destructive as that in Kathmandu however, where the primary forces of the Mukti Sena found themselves fighting troops commanded by Juddha Rana himself. Despite his troops having the advantage, the Prime Minister was felled by a stray shot when driving rebel troops out of the western stretches of the capital, sending chaos throughout the ranks. Even now rudderless, the Rana troops seem set to slowly push the Mukti Sena out of the city, but likely at high cost. Calls are coming from both sides of this conflict, calling for the King to step in and save the nation..."
 nepal_events.22.a: "The King must save us!"

 nepal_events.23.t: "The Sovereign's Order"
 nepal_events.23.d: "The end to this brutal conflict came not through further death, but through the marching of the sovereign down the streets of Kathmandu, accompanied by the countless army officers who have always remained steadfastly loyal to the King. Subarna Shumsher Rana, leader of the Parishad's section of the Mukti Sena, Kunwar Singh as leader of the LSP's, and Kaiser Shumsher Rana as acting leader of the government; came forward as representatives of their sides to meet with the King shortly after his arrival.\n\nWhile both sides were in mutual agreement that the fighting had to end, neither were willing to simply surrender to the other. Ultimately however a compromise would be reached between the Parishad and the Ranas, agreeing to the formation of a government led chiefly by Tribhuvan himself. As part of this agreement, the role of Prime Minister would be first granted to the more moderate Parishad member Matrika Prasad Koirala, rather than Acharya, and loyalist members of the Rana dynasty would be granted ministerial roles for the sake of stability. Chiefly Nepal would also declare official neutrality in the Indian conflict, breaking fully with both the Dominion and the Republic's attempts to influence it.\n\nNot all were willing to accept this deal however, with the LSP objecting strongly to the neutrality proposal, while also not missing that they would be excluded from government under it. After the Parishad made clear they would be willing to accept the compromise, LSP leaders stormed out of the meeting, although with little risk of further conflict erupting as the Mukti Sena as a whole seems to have fallen in line behind the accord. For now at least, Nepal finds itself at peace, led by its restored sovereign."
 nepal_events.23.a: "All Hail His Majesty!"

 nepal_events.24.t: "Royal Restoration in Nepal"
 nepal_events.24.d.DEH: "It is hard to know how to feel about the news received this morning from Nepal. A few days ago, the revolution against the Rana regime began in full, kicking off a brutal conflict throughout Nepal, with no swift victory for either side in sight. Despite our best efforts to support the Prime Minister against the rebels, our good friend Juddha Rana was slain in the defence of Kathmandu. Clearly scared of collapse without the command of their leader, the government agreed to the King's offer to mediate a ceasefire, opening talks with the Mukti Sena about a peaceful resolution.\n\nWhile under this agreement a Parishad leader has unfortunately been rewarded with the position of Prime Minister, the King is set to truly hold the reigns of government, and many loyalist Ranas are set to be granted ministerial positions as part of the compromise. The socialist have also been completely excluded from this new government, a relief for us, although this news also came with the announcement of Nepal severing ties with both us and the Republic. Despite losing a potential ally in our fight against Calcutta, Nepal's neutrality at least keeps them from being a threat against us in the immediate future, and so we should at least be thankful the outcome was not any worse."

A few days ago, the revolution against the Rana regime began in full, kicking off a brutal conflict throughout Nepal, with no swift victory for either side in sight. Despite our best efforts to support the Mukti Sena, they found themselves almost driven out of Kathmandu, although able to kill the Rana Prime Minister in the process. Clearly believing that they stood no chance in a prolonged conflict, they jumped at the opportunity when the King offered to act as meditator between the two sides.\n\nWhile the outcome of this meditation has been the end of the absolute rule of the Ranas, and the appointment of a Parishad member as Prime Minister, the Parishad have agreed to allow Rana loyalists to take part in the government, and more importantly have agreed to exclude all socialists from it. This new government has also agreed to full neutrality when it comes to India, cutting off ties with us, but also the Dominion. Despite not gaining an ally, we have at least achieved our goal of breaking the Dominion's grip on Nepal, and so we may still be able to chalk up this incident in Nepal as a victory in the end."
 nepal_events.24.a: "Neutrality is at least better than hostility..."

 nepal_events.25.t: "Failed Coup in Kathmandu"
 nepal_events.25.d: "Despite the hopes of the Mukti Sena that they could sow chaos by striking against the government all across the nation, they were seemingly unprepared for the army to be laying in wait for them. To the west, their attempts to take Pokhara were quickly crushed by troops commanded by Ekraj Shumsher Rana, while the Prime Minister's eldest son likewise swiftly eliminated all atttempts to seize Hetauda in the south. Clearly not realising they had already lost, the remaining rebel forces attempted to launch an attack against Kathmandu as well, failing to even get within the boundaries of the city before being driven to mass rout.\n\nRebel leaders, knowing a sinking ship when they see one, have fled across the border to the Republic, clearly under the delusion that they could try to reorganise at a later date. Joining them however, rather shockingly, has been the King himself, fearing that his ties to the rebels would put him at risk of retribution now that their uprising had been crushed. With the king being treated as having abdicated the throne, leaving no obvious successor in place as his family fled alongside him, the Prime Minister has declared a regency shall take place until a new King can be found. Acting now as regent, Juddha Rana has proclaimed that Nepal will continue to crush all vestiges of this rebellion, even if it comes down to marching across the border to do so."

 nepal_events.26.t: "Revolution Fails in Nepal"
 nepal_events.26.d.DEH: "In a rare turn these days, we have finally received a round of good news. This morning, the rebels in Nepal at last launched their long planned uprising against the Rana dynasty, attempting to swiftly seize control of multiple cities across the nation. What followed however was the slaughter of hundreds of these rebels by soldiers loyal to the Prime Minister, being fully prepared for all these attacks against them. The final rebel attack against Kathmandu, comprised of the bulk of rebel forces, was quickly seen off before it even penetrated the city.\n\nIn light of their failure, rebel leaders have fled to Calcutta, surprisingly accompanied by King Tribhuvan, who allegedly attempted to back the uprising. Juddha Rana, acting as regent now with the throne vacant, has pledged to hunt down these traitors, and has declared his support for us when the Republic inevitably launches an attack against us both."
 nepal_events.26.d.BHC: "Today's news can only be described in terms like disaster, or by using a long string of expletives. Despite our strong support for the Mukti Sena, their attempted rebellion has been snuffed out before it even truly began, with government forces defeating every attempt that has been made to seize control of cities throughout the Kingdom. The rebel leadership have fled across the border to us, hoping for perhaps another opportunity in the future to oust the Ranas. The Nepali king has likewise joined them, fearing for his life due to his covert support for the rebels.\n\nMeanwhile the Nepali Prime Minister, now acting as regent, has fully aligned the nation with the Dominion, and has declared his intention to invade us to capture the Mukti Sena leadership. It seems Nepal must now be fully included into the invasion plans..."

 nepal_events.30.t: "Fate of the Frontiers"
 nepal_events.30.d: "During the Indian revolution we sent troops into multiple frontier states to garrison them for the British, preventing them from falling into the hands of the rebels. Ever since then we have officially acknowledged these lands as Indian, planning to return full control to them when the situation has stabilised enough to do so. Now that we find ourselves allied to an Indian government in full position to take them over, we have informed them of our intentions to do so, although the exact lands transferred leaves a bit of wiggle room. While it is hard to argue that [814.GetName] and [887.GetName] are not Indian, as they were fully part of British India, the Kingdom of Sikkim has always been regarded as separate in the same way we or Bhutan were. As a result, we may be able to convince our allies to recognise our control of over it, allowing it to continue to separate separate from India under our authority, while still handing over the other two territories."

 nepal_events.31.d.BHC: "Although Nepal was never our direct enemy during the Indian Revolution, their troops were deployed in support of Britain to prevent us taking key regions such as [814.GetName] and [887.GetName], as well as opportunistically seizing control of the Kingdom of Sikkim.\n\nNow that their commitments to the British and their lapdogs in Delhi are a thing of the past, they have agreed to transfer control not only of the Indian territories, but also Sikkim itself, with our troops already on their way to replace their Nepali counterparts."

With the chaos in India and the subsequent revolution in Nepal, recruitment of further Gurkhas became very difficult, with more needed back home to defend their nation. Now however with the rebellion dealt with, and Nepal wishing to repay the favour, they have sent us two divisions full of troops who fought against the Mukti Sena, with promises to return recruitment back to normal levels as soon as possible. We of course have thanked them for this, and we hope that the Gurkhas always remain a prominent part of the armed forces."

 nepal_events.200.t: "Coronation of King Samrajya"
 nepal_events.200.d: "The abdication of King Tribhuvan and the self imposed exile of his family left the Prime Minister in a rather tricky situation, with a monarch needed to ensure the stability of the realm, but with no valid options to replace the previous king. After a great degree of contemplation however, a controversial choice was made to select Tribhuvan's nephew Samrajya Shumsher Rana as the nation's new king. Despite Samrayja's close relation to the former sovereign, the young man is a member of the Rana dynasty, being the product of Tribhuvan's sister's marriage to Kaiser Rana. Believing however there to be no better choice, and also seeing the benefit of having a dynasty member directly on the throne, Juddha Rana confirmed the choice in Samrajya a few days ago.\n\nTaking an oath to serve the realm, the nation's new king, Samrajya Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana, titled as H.R.H Shree Panch Bada Maharajadhiraja \"Samrajya\", was officially coronated earlier today. While the ceremony may have not been as elaborated as many would have hoped, it was seen as a potential bad look to go too extravagent with the recent conflict, and as such the affair leaned towards the modest. The new king, under no illusions of his place in things, has reaffirmed the Prime Minister's place in the government, content in remaining a figurehead with no ambitions to repeat the fate of his predecessor."

 nepal_events.300.t: "Muted Reaction from the Indians"
 nepal_events.300.d: "Although vital to the peace process, the declaration of full neutrality on Indian matters by the King was certainly a gamble. The strong investment by both the Dominion and the Republic in influencing our politics left the real possibility that one or the other would not accept such an outcome, and would simply send in their troops to directly install a loyalist regime.\n\nIt seems for now however that the gamble has paid off, as although certainly outraged, both Indian governments are seemingly willing to accept the new status quo, seeing an outcome where Nepal doesn't fall to their enemies as good enough. With no immediate threat of invasion or further interference in the nation's politics, the new government should have ample opportunity to focus now inwards on healing the national divide."

 nepal_events.301.t: "LSP Protest the Peace Agreement"
 nepal_events.301.d: "While the LSP were immediately identified as a potential threat following the peace agreement, the withdrawal of support from Calcutta towards the now defunct Mukti Sena left most reassured they would simply fade into irrelevance. The socialists clearly must not have heard of the Republic's ambivalence however, as a protest was held today in [NEP.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] containing over 200 LSP members, led by Ram Prasad Rai and Kunwar Inderjit Singh.\n\nA fiery speech, led primarily by Singh, called for the immediate inclusion of the LSP into government, and the arrests of Kiran and Mohan Rana over civilian deaths during the uprising that Singh blamed upon the Rana dynasty. Singh concluded his speech by threatening renewed armed revolution unless the demands were met, met with cheers by his fellow rebels.\n\nNot willing to settle for this treason, prime minister Koirala ordered the protest to be broken up and its participants arrested, with Rai being amongst those now sat in the nearest jail. Singh however is alleged to have escaped from the protest without arrest, despite troops believing they had arrested him, a mistake so far blamed on them confusing another similar looking protestor with Singh. The man's whereabouts are currently unknown, but the arrest of the other members is expected to quell any more LSP upstarts from causing unrest."

 nepal_events.302.d: "Ever since he fled the protest in Kathmandu, Kunwar Singh has not only evaded capture, but has yet to even be spotted by those hunting for him, with the government hopeful he had perhaps perished in the wilderness. Although there is still no concrete evidence to the contrary, a recent attack against troops operating nearby Hetauda clearly has the hallmarks of Singh and his fellow dissidents. A local outpost, staffed by a few dozen men, was suddenly set upon by an unclear number of armed marauders.\n\nAfter an initial conflict, which saw the death of two soldiers, the outpost was briefly surrendered to these bandits, before reinforcements managed to drive them off after a short battle. Those amongst the additional casualties on the insurrectionist side were found to be wearing Indian Republican Army uniforms, much like those supplied to the Mukti Sena. While not definitive proof of Singh's involvement, it is certainly proof of LSP dissidents attempting a rebellion, and the government will need to respond."

Despite their exclusion from government, many former LSP members were included amongst their numbers, an idea proven now to very much have been a mistake. Those still loyal to Singh and Rai have carried out an uprising in [NEP.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], joined quickly by Singh and his dissidents from Hetauda, freeing Rai and the other protestors from prison.\n\n"

Clearly to their surprise however, after a day besieged by government troops and loyal members of the Raksha Dal, the rebels didn't even receive a response back from the Republic let alone the reinforcements they hoped for.\n\nWith no fear of having to contend with troops from the south, government troops launched an attack to drive the rebels from the palace, to very quick success.

A slew of disagreements, ranging from opposition to any Rana involvement in the government, to opposing the Palace's role in politics, or even just personal disagreements with the new prime minister; has begun to show fractures in the once united party.\n\nThose who count themselves most loyal to Acharya have been the first to begin expressing disapproval of the new status quo, significantly objecting to his passing over in favour of Koirala.

Theories are abound that those dissatisfied with M.P's governance, especially in regards to the recent approval of an upper house solely appointed to by the King, have begun to push to replace the prime minister, winning B.P's support by promising him his brother's position.\n\nOfficially however, all amongst the Parishad have denied any rift emerging within the party, hoping that any instability can simply be weathered with enough time..."
 nepal_events.305.a: "Is a little dispute not normal between brothers?"

 nepal_events.306.t: "The Expulsion of M.P Koirala"
 nepal_events.306.d: "Despite hopes of weathering the storm, it seems that the rifts within the Parishad could not simply be glossed over. Members of the party, led by Acharya and B.P Koirala, have moved to expel M.P as a member of the Parishad, with claims that he has betrayed the goals of the revolution through his continued governance alongside the Ranas and his lack of commitment to fully democratising Nepal.\n\nMost of the Parishad has expressed their support for the decision, although not all of the Prime Minister's allies have abandoned him, with many speaking out in his favour. Mohan and Kaiser Rana, as representatives of their dynasty, have also expressed their support for the Prime Minister, and at least for now neither the King or the Prime Minister have given any indication that M.P Koirala will resign from his position. How the government proceeds from here however, is still anyone's guess."
 nepal_events.306.a: "Infighting and revolutionaries, such an inevitable combination."

 nepal_events.307.t: "Splintering of the Parishad"
 nepal_events.307.d: "Not willing to take his expulsion laying down, the Prime Minister's allies have now fully broken from the Parishad, joining in solidarity with Koirala. Under the leadership of M.P, a new party has been formed to attempt to continue governing the nation, known as the Rastriya Praja Party (National People's Party). Comprised primarily of the more conservative members of the Parishad, the Praja Party's initial official positions include steadfast support for the King's role in government, opposition to any factionalism, and the pursuit of national stability.\n\nWhile the Prime Minister is clearly confident in being able to continue his tenure utilising this new party, the Parishad's leadership have requested the King dismiss him as prime minister, threatening to withdraw their support for the government if he remains in office. Tribhuvan, unwilling for now to concede to their demands, has refused to directly state his stance on the crisis. Neither supporting the Prime Minister nor dismissing him, it seems for now the King is simply waiting to see if M.P can hold on or not."
 nepal_events.307.a: "It may be time to reconsider Koirala's position."

 nepal_events.308.t: "M.P Koirala Tenders his Resignation"
 nepal_events.308.d: "Although the Parishad have not yet made good on their threat to withdraw support from government, it has quickly become obvious to the Prime Minister and the King that the former's time in office cannot continue, even with the Praja Party's support. Ultimately wanting stability above everything else, M.P Koirala has submitted his resignation to the King, preparing to move into the backlines of politics once again.\n\nTo attempt to form a new government, the King has initially turned to the Parishad, with Acharya being the obvious next candidate for prime minister. The biggest roadblock on this however has been the Ranas, of whose key members have stated their refusal to work with these \"radical\", and of whom the Parishad have expressed equal sentiments.\n\nWith neither side willing to compromise, Tribhuvan's closest confidants have proposed that for now the King simply take direct control of the nation, directing the remaining elements of the national government through emergency powers. They propose the establishment of an advisory council, comprised of key Shah dynasty members such as Purendra Bikram Shah, to ensure the King's will is enforced properly. While the Rana leadership won't be happy with this idea, they will most likely stay on board with it, even if Acharya's allies will almost certainly object. The King is now faced with a difficult choice, but one that must be made."
 nepal_events.308.a: "Appoint Acharya as Koirala's replacement."
 nepal_events.308.b: "The King must directly rule for now."

 nepal_events.400.t: "Reorganisation of the Ranas"
 nepal_events.400.d: "Although many Ranas fled Nepal as the revolution swept the nation, the former Prime Minister chief amongst them, quite a few chose to stand their ground and remain in Nepal. Not willing to cause further strife, they have been left to their own devices so far, with few expecting them to pose a threat following their complete removal from power. It seems however that they cannot be counted out just yet, as those amongst the remaining dynasty members in Nepal have found themselves reorganised around a new organisation led by Mohan Shumsher Rana.\n\nHaving allied himself with the minor Gorkha nationalist group known as the \"Khukuri Dal\", Mohan has formed a new political party operating now under the name \"Veer Gorkha Dal\", clearly hoping to contest any upcoming elections in an attempt to restore his dynasty's rule over the nation. While not officially advocating a direct restoration of the previous system, and not yet having taken any actions that would be illegal, many members of this \"Khukuri Dal\" are clearly paramilitary in nature, with the new government fearing that the Ranas may be plotting a violent revolution of their own to restore power. Unless they start to act however, there is little the government can do but monitor them."
 nepal_events.400.a: "Ensure their activities are permanently monitored."

 nepal_events.401.t: "The Lines Begin to Form"
 nepal_events.401.d: "Although once united in their desire to free Nepal from the Ranas, the question of what happens after a revolution always has a habit of fracturing the ranks. Even prior to the revolution the Parishad frequently bickered over the right way to conduct themselves, and although the position of violent revolution won out, a major faction stuck to the belief that the Ranas should have been ousted through peaceful protest. This faction, led primarily by the Koirala brothers Matrika and Bishweshwar, have now begun to further diverge from the main wing of the party that back the Prime Minister.\n\nWhile the wing behind Acharya has pushed ahead towards a fully constitutional monarchy, as well as advocating for industrialisation more along the lines of the Calcutta government, the Koirala wing has taken a firm oppositional stance. Wishing instead for a capitalist style system, as well as claiming that the nation risks falling into tyranny again without the guiding hand of the king, they have begun to privately push back against many proposals by the Prime Minister. Still ultimately loyal to the revolution however, this bickering for now seems unlikely to break up the Parishad, but has begun to expose the fault lines that may later crack open."
 nepal_events.401.a: "Petty bickering is unlikely to unite the nation."

 nepal_events.402.t: "Fracturing of the LSP"
 nepal_events.402.d: "Although they played a significant role in the revolution against the Ranas, the socialists of the Labour Swatantra Party have almost as a whole found themselves locked out of the new Nepali system. With Calcutta firmly in support of the Parishad, the LSP have found almost all foreign support for them to have evaporated, and due to their controversial policies such as republicanism they have found themselves unable to legally register as a political party under the new system. While the more radical members of the party have discussed a second revolution against the new system, their lack of backing has made this a non-starter, and those less committed to the socialist cause have given up on the party's hopes.\n\nTo that end, a new socialist party has been established, splintering off from the LSP. The Samyukta Swatantra Party, or United Independence Party, has shed the most controversial aspects of the LSP, primarily abandoning republicanism and accepting the position of a constitutional monarchy. Although denounced as splitters by the LSP, the party has managed to gain a sizable number of members from its ranks, while also absorbing a few of the Parishad's radicals. This new party however is unlikely to find itself near national leadership any time soon, with their policies still too radical for most of the population, but they clearly represent a possible future for the left in the new Nepal."
 nepal_events.402.a: "Better fractured than a threat."

 nepal_events.500.t: "The Monarchy Problem"
 nepal_events.500.d: "Despite the desire of much of our leadership, and especially our allies in Calcutta, to abolish the monarchy, the government is heavily reliant on the support of committed monarchists to continue to exist. Even though we rule now without their input, the number of actual socialist republicans in Nepal is barely enough to fill a room on a good day, with the Parishad and other pro-monarchy groups greatly outnumbering us. Turning them against us by getting rid of the monarchy could heavily destabilise our regime, although with Calcutta's backing we can likely hold on.\n\nAs an attempt to compromise with the monarchists, a proposal has been put forward to grant Tribhuvan the title of \"Chief of State\", the Rajya Pramukha, a purely ceremonial title to recognise his status while still maintaining the government's authority. While potentially not enough to satisfy the most committed monarchists, it is likely to placate enough to matter. Few in the government are happy about this solution though, believing that keeping the monarchists around in any capacity will weaken the state in the long run, and have instead suggested simply ripping off the plaster now and dealing with the consequences."
 nepal_events.500.a: "Permit a ceremonial role for the former king."

If the people of Nepal are to have a future the reign of the Rana tyrants must come to an end."
 NEP_establishing_contacts_within_the_army: "Establishing Contacts Within the Army"
 NEP_establishing_contacts_within_the_army_desc: "While the Army answers to the Prime Minister like the rest of the government, the Nepalese Army is not a totally lost cause. Many surely resent the rule of the Ranas or hold loyalty to the hostage King Tribhuvan. By making contact with these forward thinking patriots within the army we can pave the way for the fall of the Ranas."
 NEP_cooperating_with_exiled_ranas: "Cooperating with Exiled Ranas"
 NEP_cooperating_with_exiled_ranas_desc: "While the Ranas have brought ruin to Nepal, not every Rana has our worst interests at heart. We may gain the upper hand by seeking the support of those spurned or exiled by their relatives in power."
 NEP_strengthen_ties_with_calcutta: "Strengthening Ties with Calcutta"
 NEP_strengthen_ties_with_calcutta_desc: "Our comrades in Calcutta carry great sympathy towards our cause and their support may be vital in supporting the Liberation Army. If we are to succeed in forcing the Ranas out we must deepen our ties with the People’s Republic."
 NEP_appeal_to_hindu_unity: "Appeal to Hindu Unity"
 NEP_appeal_to_hindu_unity_desc: "Ever since the great King Prithvi Narayan Shah declared Nepal to be Asal Hindustan, True India, in a show of defiance towards the Islamic Mughal emperors, Nepal has maintained a reputation as the last free bastion of Hinduism. There are many in India, not just within the Republic, who believe that the freedom of Nepal is vital to the defence of Hinduism against foreign influences; and although we may not share their radicalism on the issue, their support is certainly welcome."
 NEP_preparing_border_infiltration_efforts: "Preparing Border Infiltration Efforts"
 NEP_preparing_border_infiltration_efforts_desc: "We must sow the seeds of victory so that when the decisive moment arrives we will be fully prepared to deal a deadly blow to the Rana oppressors. To that end we are covertly moving supporters and allies across the border, gaining intel and well positioned assets to use at the right moment."
 NEP_training_with_the_republican_army: "Training With the Republican Army"
 NEP_training_with_the_republican_army_desc: "The Ranas will not be overthrown through a few sternly worded pamphlets, they must be removed by force, with the Prime Minister's himself being dealt with in a similar fashion. The priority of the Mukti Sena must be to train an army together with our Indian allies, and prepare for the inevitable war for the liberation of Nepal."
 NEP_sowing_the_seeds_for_democracy: "Sowing the Seeds for Democracy"
 NEP_sowing_the_seeds_for_democracy_desc: "While it is almost certain the Ranas will not simply step down on their own, and force will be required to remove them, we cannot forget that simply seizing power through force and the killing of political leaders is how the Ranas carved out their regime in the first place. Our priority must be to prepare for building a free Nepal after the Prime Minister has been deposed, not just how to depose him, as without such preparations we could easily fall back towards tyranny."
 NEP_limit_the_spread_of_propaganda: "Limit the Spread of Propaganda"
 NEP_limit_the_spread_of_propaganda_desc: "It seems a day does not go by where some newspaper from Delhi or Calcutta is distributed in Kathmandu, or a man with a Punjabi or Bengali accent begins to spread rumours to all those who will listen. These rather obvious attempts to sway Nepal must not be tolerated, and we will crack down upon it at every opportunity."
 NEP_request_restraint_by_all_factions: "Request Restraint by All Factions"
 NEP_request_restraint_by_all_factions_desc: "Although the current situation is far from perfect, the situation in Nepal will almost certainly get even worse if the Mukti Sena escalate their revolution or the Ranas get harsher in their attempted crackdown. We canot afford as a nation to be mired by bloodshed, and we must plea for restraint, even if it falls often on deaf ears"
 NEP_defending_our_sovereignty: "Defending Our Sovereignty"
 NEP_defending_our_sovereignty_desc: "It is shameful that Nepal is being fought over as though it were simply a toy of great powers, rather than a proud nation in its own right. No one shall decide the politics of Nepal but Nepal itself, and we must prevent all outside attempts to influence things in favour of either side of this conflict if we do not wish to become a mere puppet state."
 NEP_put_faith_in_his_majesty: "Put Faith in His Majesty"
 NEP_put_faith_in_his_majesty_desc: "If there is one beacon of stability Nepal still has in this tumultuous time, it is his majesty King Tribhuvan Shah, and even if the nation is hit by chaos, we must have faith that the King's guidance will see us through to a brighter future."

 NEP_acquiring_indian_surplus: "Acquiring Indian Surplus"
 NEP_acquiring_indian_surplus_desc: "The conflict for India has proliferated significant stocks of excess military equipment and it is vital that we acquire as much as we are able to. What is surplus for others may be the difference between defeat and survival for Nepal."
 NEP_guarding_the_prime_minister: "Guarding the Prime Minister"
 NEP_guarding_the_prime_minister_desc: "As our country’s future depends upon the safety of its leader, their protection is paramount for the army. For this reason we will create an elite force, not only capable of standing directly between the leader and harm but also of defending the nation at its borders and if necessary striking into enemy territory."
 NEP_protecting_kathmandu: "Protecting Kathmandu"
 NEP_protecting_kathmandu_desc: "Should worst come to worst, it is vital that the capital and the surrounding Kathmandu Valley be defended from foreign invasion. These defences must not just be made up of the existing geographic barriers but also by strong manmade fortifications, made with an understanding of the methods and means of modern warfare."
 NEP_preparing_for_tibetan_aggression: "Preparing for Tibetan Aggression"
 NEP_preparing_for_tibetan_aggression_desc: "Despite past attempts to clarify the situation our border with Tibet remains ill defined and vulnerable in several key locations. While an attack from the north currently seems unlikely it is important that the government prepare for that eventuality should a northern neighbor seek a more forceful demarcation of the border."
 NEP_when_the_ganga_runs_red: "When the Ganga Runs Red"
 NEP_when_the_ganga_runs_red_desc: "With the resumption of war to our south Nepal’s future has never been more uncertain. Whether we enter the struggle for India directly or back our favored contender from a distance it is vital that we play an active role in determining who will dominate the future of the subcontinent."
 NEP_built_around_an_elite_core: "Built Around an Elite Core"
 NEP_built_around_an_elite_core_desc: "The future of the Nepalese Army depends on us building upon the elite traditions that made soldiers from Nepal renowned and feared across the world. Rather than upending what has clearly shown itself to be highly effective we will focus on ensuring that the whole Army of Nepal lives up to the reputation set by its best."
 NEP_favouring_flexibility: "Favouring Flexibility"
 NEP_favouring_flexibility_desc: "While our soldiers may be mighty in nature, we do have to recognise that we are unlikely to win against larger powers in a conventional battle. It is fortunate for us then however, that not all battles have to be conventional, and as such we should prepare our soldiers to operate in whatever situation they find themselves in, hopefully giving us the needed advantage against the unprepared."
 NEP_capitalising_on_breakthroughs: "Capitalising on Breakthroughs"
 NEP_capitalising_on_breakthroughs_desc: "With the elite nature of our finest soldiers, breaking through the enemies lines is certainly possible to accomplish, but these gains are rather meaningless if we do not know how to take advantage of it. Our soldiers must therefore be trained to quickly against disorganised forces, even if it does mean operating unconnected from our wider logistics networks."
 NEP_kafar_hunu_bhanda_marnu_ramro: "Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro"
 NEP_kafar_hunu_bhanda_marnu_ramro_desc: "\"Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro\", or that it is better to die than live like a coward, is a motto many of our soldiers live and die by. Where others would flee in fear at the first sign of trouble, our men stand firm, and win victories that others are too cowardly to achieve, and it is this that truly separates Nepali troops from anyone else."
 NEP_invest_in_mountaineering_equipment: "Invest in Mountaineering Gear"
 NEP_invest_in_mountaineering_equipment_desc: "Although many of our men are familiar with operating in Nepal's mountainous regions, even the most expert mountaineer will perform poorly in these conditions without the proper equipment. It is vital therefore that our men are provided with the best we can get our hands on, after all we cannot expect them to traverse mountainous terrain with just their bare hands and courage now can we?"
 NEP_specialise_the_doctrines: "Specialise the Doctrines"
 NEP_specialise_the_doctrines_desc: "Nepali soldiers are unlikely to find themselves storming the beaches of Dorset or fighting through the Yucatán moist forests, and so there is little reason to spend time training them for the countless situations they'll probably never encounter. Instead our focus should be for preparing them for fighting in the hills and mountains that make up much of the immediate region, and simply letting our allies handle the rest."
 NEP_modernising_the_royal_army: "Modernising the [NEP_loc_army_name]"
 NEP_modernising_the_royal_army_desc: "While Nepalese soldiers have a fearsome reputation our army as a whole is woefully behind the times in structure, in equipment and in doctrine. To build an army that plays to Nepal’s strengths we must first build an army that is capable of facing modern challenges and modern opponents on the battlefield."
 NEP_the_guns_of_a_modern_age: "The Guns of a Modern Age"
 NEP_the_guns_of_a_modern_age_desc: "Artillery has long held an irreplaceable role in warfare, with its importance only growing with time, yet even today you'll struggle to find enough Nepalese soldiers familiar enough with the equipment to build a battalion. If we wish to modernise the army, acquiring artillery for our troops, and training them how to use it, must be our first priority."
 NEP_expand_the_labour_corp: "Expand the Labour Corp"
 NEP_expand_the_labour_corp_desc: "While the Nepali army certainly has soldiers that could fall under the classification of engineers or sappers, it would be almost embarrassing to compare them to the proper engineering companies of the great powers of the world. Still even with their inexperience, these men can easily serve as a perfect foundation to build a new and expanded Labour Corp that may one day find itself on par with them."
 NEP_copying_indian_tactics: "Copying Indian Tactics"
 NEP_copying_indian_tactics_desc: "The Indian Revolution taught many how a war with modern equipment would be fought in India, and as such the Indian armies quickly began to formulate new doctrines based upon their experiences. Instead of trying to develop ideas on how we would fight in India on our own, it would be much easier to simply take inspiration from them instead, as they've already done the hard work for us."
 NEP_utilise_contemporary_planning_methods: "Utilise Contemporary Planning Methods"
 NEP_utilise_contemporary_planning_methods_desc: "Warfare being so multifaceted these days has rather complicated traditional methods of planning battles, and we cannot expect to still win with tactics developed when the largest thing you'd see flying above a battlefield is a hungry vulture. A great effort must be put into modernising our methods, potentially along the lines of our Indian neighbours, from whom we are already gleaning significant knowledge."
 NEP_capitalise_on_volunteer_eagerness: "Capitalise on Volunteer Eagerness"
 NEP_capitalise_on_volunteer_eagerness_desc: "If there is one area that Nepal does not lack, it is men willing to pick up a rifle and go to the frontlines. In both 1914 and 1925, thousands of Nepali men left the country to fight for our British allies with very little prodding, and such enthusiasm is still widespread throughout the nation, something we should prepare to capitalise on for expanding the army."
 NEP_implementation_of_conscription: "Implementation of Conscription"
 NEP_implementation_of_conscription_desc: "Even with many Nepali men being willing to sign up for the armed forces with little prodding, the deteriorating situation in the region means that even these volunteers are likely not enough to defend the nation if it were under threat. We should therefore move to implementing a system of conscription to ensure national security."
 NEP_invest_in_nakhu_rifle_workshops: "Invest in Nakhu Rifle Workshops"
 NEP_invest_in_nakhu_rifle_workshops_desc: "Nepal has never been known for its production of firearms, but quite a few attempts at producing rifles of our own were carried out by the late Gehendra Shumsher Rana in Nakhu. While not exactly impressive, the leftover equipment used for these operations is certainly better than nothing for reviving rifle production efforts, and so should be used as our starting point."
 NEP_training_from_foreign_advisors: "Training From Foreign Advisors"
 NEP_training_from_foreign_advisors_desc: "Whether one becomes an office in the Nepali army has often come down to the question \"How closely related to the Prime Minister are you?\", and as such the nation rather lacks a proper experienced officer class. If we wish to change this however, we will have to invite foreign experts in to help train our men, due to the aforementioned drought of experience."
 NEP_inviting_air_instructors: "Inviting Air Instructors"
 NEP_inviting_air_instructors_desc: "While the well off in Nepal have certainly heard of the existence of airplanes, there are very few in the country who can actually attest to their existence. As such, attempting to build any level of air force is certainly going to be a tall order that is going to be almost entirely reliant on outside experts and pilots. Perhaps with their support, we may be able to get a few planes of our own into the sky one day."

 NEP_war_with_sikkim:0 "War With Sikkim"
 NEP_war_with_sikkim_desc:0 "The small mountainous nation of Sikkim has long resisted Nepalese domination. However the time has at last come for Gantok to be assimilated into our nation. We shall be the one and only ruler of the Himalayas. At long last, we shall march on Gantok and claim domain over the mighty Himalayan Mountain Range."
 NEP_protection_of_nepalese_independence: "Protection of Nepalese Independence"
 NEP_protection_of_nepalese_independence_desc: "Rather than simply being subjugated by a more powerful neighbour, Nepal has stood firm against foreign control, while successfully escaping the tyranny of the Ranas. Such freedom should not be taken as a given however, and we must ensure that we are never in a position to be subjugated ever again."
 NEP_resolving_the_bhutan_conflict: "Resolving the Bhutan Conflict"
 NEP_resolving_the_bhutan_conflict_desc: "Excluding the few decades where the British prevented them from doing so, much of Bhutanese history has involved violent raids against its neighbours, especially the former Kingdom of Sikkim. As a result of the Indian revolution we secured control of Sikkim, angering the Bhutanese, who have raided us ever since. It is time to seek revenge for these raids, and potentially liberate the Nepali minority Bhutan so brutally represses."
 NEP_integration_of_the_frontiers: "Integration of the Frontiers"
 NEP_integration_of_the_frontiers_desc: "Intended officially as a temporary arrangement, the border regions of Uttaranchal and Darjeeling have been in limbo for some time, with neither side being able to establish complete control. With the forces of Sikkim defeated and our intention now to be to break away from foreign control of any kind now clear, it would be prudent not to make a move to reclaim these regions. After all of course, these lands were once Nepali, having simply been stolen from us by British conquests, and so it is our right to own them."
 NEP_punishing_tibetan_insolence: "Punishing Tibetan Insolence"
 NEP_punishing_tibetan_insolence_desc: "The Tibetans have long been an insolent people, frequently treating us as though they are our betters, making ludicrous demands of us and oppressing our people. A few short years ago their brutual murder of Nepali citizens almost led to a war between us, prevented only by fears of intervention by Calcutta or Beijing, but with both now less of a concern it is finally time to put the Tibetans in their place."
 NEP_reaffirm_the_friendship_treaty: "Reaffirm the Friendship Treaty"
 NEP_reaffirm_the_friendship_treaty_desc: "With the Dominion's support being vital to our survival, and our nation once again firmly back in the British sphere, we should seek to resign the friendship treaty we reached with Britain, but now instead with our friends in [DEH.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. This treaty was first signed before the Indians lacked their current independence, and as such it is important to recognise its continuity with the Dominion separately from the British, simply as a symbolic gesture of our strong bonds if nothing else."
 NEP_uphold_gurkha_commitments: "Uphold Gurkha Commitments"
 NEP_uphold_gurkha_commitments_desc: "Nepalese troops, operating in British Gurkha battalions, were fundamental to the survival of British rule during the Indian Revolution, and they are likely to remain as such as long as the Dominion continues to exist. To repay their support in stopping our own revolution, we should make sure men are still sent to aid our Indian friends, and acquire the materiel needed to keep them trained for future endeavours."
 NEP_technological_exchange_with_raj: "Technological Exchange with the Dominion"
 NEP_technological_exchange_with_raj_desc: "Our alliance with the Dominion represents a great opportunity for the transfer of knowledge between our two nations, with foreign industrial experts and modern technological breakthroughs now being at our fingertips. Such an opportunity, regardless of our reluctance to fully industrialise the nation, should not simply be ignored, and so we should seek to capitalise on it posthaste."

 NEP_under_the_wings_of_the_republic_PRF: "Seek Accommodation with the Federation"
 NEP_under_the_wings_of_the_republic_desc: "Without support from the Indians, it is likely that the Mukti Sena would have been crushed, and Nepal would have suffered under the oppression of the Ranas forevermore. We will never forget the great gift of freedom the Indians have provided to us, and we should seek to publicly recognise the vital role they played to show our gratitude."
 NEP_seek_indian_economic_aid: "Seek Indian Economic Aid"
 NEP_seek_indian_economic_aid_desc: "Industrialising Nepal shall be no easy task, and attempting to handle it solely by ourselves is unlikely to achieve fast or effective results. It is lucky then that our new friends to the south have such a strong industry to aid us with, even with the destruction of the civil war. With their help, Nepal may be able to one day call itself a truly modern nation."
 NEP_acquire_blueprints_from_ishapore: "Acquire Blueprints from Ishapore"
 NEP_acquire_blueprints_from_ishapore_desc: "Established first by the British and expanded greatly after its capture by [BHC.GetNameDef], Ishapore is potentially one of the most productive rifle factories in all of Asia, and as such has the capacity to produce a large number of firearms. If we wish to produce guns more fitting of the 20th century, rather than modified Martini Henries that most of our troops still utilise, there's no place better to get the blueprints than Ishapore."
 NEP_renegotiate_defence_obligations: "Renegotiate Defence Obligations"
 NEP_renegotiate_defence_obligations_desc: "With the civil war in India now over, and our ally having emerged victorious against their barbarous rivals, the current level of Indian military presence in Nepal is no longer needed, and as such we are free to push for a greater deal of independence from their influence. Let us hope that our allies agree with this sentiment, and allow us to operate once again as a free nation."

 NEP_the_padma_shumsher_economic_plan: "The Padma Shumsher Economic Plan"
 NEP_the_padma_shumsher_economic_plan_desc: "In spite of opposition to the concept from the Prime Minister, as well as many major dynasty members, the Dominion has demanded that we begin to industrialise for the sake of security of both our nations. They have backed the ideas of senior member Padma Shumsher Rana, whose radical ideas have put him at odds with much of the government, but are likely to achieve what the Dominion demands of us."
 NEP_implementing_the_company_act: "Implement the Company Act"
 NEP_implementing_the_company_act_desc: "It is unlikely that Nepali industry will begin itself without government intervention, as few in the nation whose name does not end with \"Rana\" have the capacity to do so. It is therefore up to the government to kickstart industrial development, and as such we should begin the creation of multiple government ran industries in textiles and other such easily accessible markets."
 NEP_importing_displaced_indian_workers: "Importing Displaced Indian Workers"
 NEP_importing_displaced_indian_workers_desc: "Years of conflict in India have left many displaced and desperate, making a rather perfect group of employees for our blossoming industries. Many of these people will have experience working in factories already, and by hiring them we can also avoid empowering the average Nepali citizen any further than we have to."
 NEP_ensure_defence_of_the_regime: "Ensure Defence of the Regime"
 NEP_ensure_defence_of_the_regime_desc: "Despite our best efforts, it is likely that we may face a repeat of the recent uprising in the future, and it is uncertain that we can continue to rely on other nations to produce the arms needed to defeat any further insurrection. We must therefore revive prior efforts to produce guns locally, even if they may be somewhat lacking compared to what can be acquired elsewhere."
 NEP_place_limits_on_tax_skimming: "Place Limits on Tax Skimming"
 NEP_place_limits_on_tax_skimming_desc: "Despite voracious opposition to the idea by his dynasty members, Padma Shumsher has declared his desire to reduce the amount of money funnelled away from the state to fund the many whims of the Ranas. With his backing by the Dominion, there is little we can do to stop such tyranny."
 NEP_cotton_and_jute_mills_in_biratnagar: "Cotton and Jute Mills in Biratnagar"
 NEP_cotton_and_jute_mills_in_biratnagar_desc: "The city of Biratnagar, located in the flat lands of the Terai, is the perfect place for the nation's first big industrial projects. We should seek to establish major jute and cotton mills here, as its closeness to the Indian border means that products made in these factories such as twine, jute sacks, and clothing can easily be exported to our wealthy neighbour."
 NEP_expanding_the_industrial_council: "Expanding the Industrial Council"
 NEP_expanding_the_industrial_council_desc: "The Udyog Parishad, the Industrial Council, represents one of the few previous attempts by Juddha Rana to entertain the idea of industrialisation. It was established as a way to direct funding towards any industrialisation efforts, primarily aiming to expand elements such as the logging industry his family members profit significantly from. It will now serve as the perfect foundations for furthering the growth of other key national industries."
 NEP_furthering_thoshe_mining_efforts: "Furthering Thoshe Mining Efforts"
 NEP_furthering_thoshe_mining_efforts_desc: "The Thoshe mine in Ramechhap is one of the largest for iron in the country, although extraction has slowed down significantly in recent years. Local access to iron for steel is likely to be extremely important in industrialisation however, and as such we should ensure that these mining efforts not only resume but we must also oversee their major expansion."

 NEP_bringing_nepal_into_the_industrial_age: "Bringing Nepal Into the Industrial Age"
 NEP_bringing_nepal_into_the_industrial_age_desc: "Nepal as a nation has long had the capacity to become an industrial power, but as a result of Rana misrule it finds itself centuries behind its neighbours. The government's primary priority once it has stabilised itself should be to reverse course, and finally set Nepal on the path of industrialisation and economic growth."
 NEP_beginning_the_five_year_plan: "Beginning the Five Year Plan"
 NEP_beginning_the_five_year_plan_desc: "The concept of year long economic plans has become rather common place in recent years as solutions to economic backwardness. These ideas find themselves commonplace across the border in India, and have slowly begun to take hold amongst members of the government in Kathmandu. With their arguments winning out, Nepal is now set to begin a five year plan of its own, by the end of which industrialisation should be achieved."
 NEP_inviting_indian_investors: "Inviting Indian Investors"
 NEP_inviting_indian_investors_desc: "The Nepali economic is unlikely to grow entirely on its own, and it shouldn't really be expected to do so. Many across the border in India are almost salivating at the thought of building a name for themselves through investing in Nepal's blossoming industry, and we should capitalise on such enthusiasm to further our growth."
 NEP_utilising_our_natural_beauty: "Utilising Our Natural Beauty"
 NEP_utilising_our_natural_beauty_desc: "Although set back by the Indian Revolution, Nepal has begun to develop somewhat of a name for itself amongst many foreigners in regards to its natural beauty. There are countless rich men and women who will pay fortunes to be able to climb our mountains and experience our culture, and there is little reason to deny such visitors the opportunity to provide us with their wealth."
 NEP_growing_the_pashmina_industry: "Growing the Pashmina Industry"
 NEP_growing_the_pashmina_industry_desc: "While the wool of cashmere goats is associated so heavily with Kashmir, to the point of being named after the region, the pashmina products produced with it are frequently made in Nepal as well. For years Nepali pashmina has found itself worn even as far away as the glamorous New York city in America, and despite their civil war there is still a high demand both there and worldwide for these luxury products; one we should seek to fill as much as we can."
 NEP_towards_a_national_highway_network: "Towards a National Highway Network"
 NEP_towards_a_national_highway_network_desc: "While the Postal Highway project started by the Ranas is certainly a fantastic starting point, we must dream bigger and seek to connect the entire nation together through a grand network of highways. Although unlikely to be completed any time soon, even the most basic of developments is likely to repeat major short term benefits for the nation."
 NEP_adopting_modern_irrigation_methods: "Adopting Modern Irrigation Methods"
 NEP_adopting_modern_irrigation_methods_desc: "Irrigation is vital to crop growth, and while the rest of the world has begun to move away from the days where a lack of rain could cripple a country, many regions of Nepal find themselves still at risk of drought inflicted hunger. We must seek to improve our irrigation networks, in hopes that one day not a single person in Nepal will be able to tell you what boiled grass tastes like."
 NEP_ramp_up_national_exports: "Ramp Up National Exports"
 NEP_ramp_up_national_exports_desc: "The future of Nepal's economy must become one where we benefit greatly from exports of products ranging from raw metals all the way up to intricately produced garments and timer products. We must ramp up the production across all industries as much as we can, while similarly seeking new markets to sell these goods in, and in time the whole nation will likely begin to benefit."

 NEP_paving_the_postal_highway: "Paving the Postal Highway"
 NEP_paving_the_postal_highway_desc: "The Postal Highway project was initiated at the start of the decade, with the goal of having one continuous road run along the entire southern border of the country, primarily focused on postal delivery as the name implies. Much of this project still remains unfinished however, and it should be a national priority to further its development with the government now much more stable."
 NEP_revive_the_government_railway_plan: "Revive the Government Railway Plan"
 NEP_revive_the_government_railway_plan_desc: "Plans for the first railway in Nepal, which aimed to connect local logging industries near the border to buyers in India, were completely scuppered by the Indian revolution. With the situation in both India and Nepal stable enough, these plans should be revived as the foundations of rail transport in Nepal."
 NEP_connecting_to_the_frontier: "Connecting to the Frontier"
 NEP_connecting_to_the_frontier_desc: "Although Nepali troops may control many of its frontier regions, they act rather autonomously from the capital owing to how hard it is to reach them from Kathmandu. With our recent foray into rail infrastructure, it would be prudent to attempt to build railways connecting to the frontier to further our reach."
 NEP_bringing_in_foreign_experts: "Bringing in Foreign Experts"
 NEP_bringing_in_foreign_experts_desc: "Technological development is vital to a growing economy, and yet Nepal finds itself rather lacking in anyone to actually lead such development. We should therefore seek to invite those from across the world, willing to work for a tidy government salary, to lead our development efforts into the future."
 NEP_constructing_the_sundarijal_station: "Constructing the Sundarijal Station"
 NEP_constructing_the_sundarijal_station_desc: "For quite a few years now plans have been put in place to construct a hydroelectric plant of some kind at the source of the Bagmati river in Sundarijal. A small gravity dam in this location will be perfect for providing electricity to Kathmandu, and with the recent growth in industrial capacity we are at last in a position to actually construct such a station."

 NEP_regency_of_the_ranas: "Regency of the Ranas"
 NEP_regency_of_the_ranas_desc: "Though beset by enemies from without and traitors from within, the Rana government has survived. The socialist rabble of the Mukti Sena have been broken and flee back to their masters in Calcutta, along with the traitor King. Having come so close to the brink it is only natural that the guiding hand of the Prime Minister should tighten its grip to prevent a repeat of this disaster."
 NEP_replacing_the_rebellious_ruler: "Replacing the Rebellious Ruler"
 NEP_replacing_the_rebellious_ruler_desc: "With the Ingrate King Tribhuvan fleeing the country along with much of his family the Regent is left with the dilemma of serving at the nominal behest of a vacant throne. For the sake of ensuring the realms stability and the continuity of the Rana government we must quickly find a candidate with a valid claim, who also understands who truly holds the reigns."
 NEP_purge_the_army_of_royalists: "Purge the Army of Royalists"
 NEP_purge_the_army_of_royalists_desc: "Although we succeeded in fending off the threat of a royalist restoration for the moment much of the army remains dedicated to the defeated King and the royal house. Since we cannot eliminate the monarchy entirely we must ensure that the army does not become a bastion for any fools hoping to repeat the example of the former King Tribhuvan."
 NEP_furthering_control_of_village_courts: "Furthering Control of Village Courts"
 NEP_furthering_control_of_village_courts_desc: "Across Nepal much of the day to day governance is handled by local bodies whose interests and concerns are similarly local. By increasing our hand in these bodies we can ensure that the desires and needs of the government are truly felt across the nation and known to the people."
 NEP_ramp_up_revenue_extraction: "Ramp Up Revenue Extraction"
 NEP_ramp_up_revenue_extraction_desc: "It is clear we have been too good to the average citizen, as they gain wealth while the state struggles to fund itself. We must solve this injustice by increasing taxes wherever possible, with the malgujari land tax being certainly a perfect candidate for such an increase. While the peasants will of course object, we have never listened to their say on such matters, and we do not intend to start doing so now."
 NEP_developing_a_moral_education_system: "Developing a Moral Education System"
 NEP_developing_a_moral_education_system_desc: "If the defeated threat of the Mukti Sena has shown anything it is that a great deal of Nepal is frightfully open to preaching of scoundrels infected with absurd foreign ideologies. For the future of the nation the next generation must grow up with a proper understanding of their place in the world and the wisdom of their leaders."
 NEP_harness_gorkha_nationalist_rhetoric: "Harness Gorkha Nationalist Rhetoric"
 NEP_harness_gorkha_nationalist_rhetoric_desc: "There is a slow growing belief amongst some of the more junior members of the dynasty that in order for Rana rule to continue long term, we will need to convince the average Nepali we are working for their interests. It has been suggested therefore we attempt to coopt the growing nationalist movement, found both here and across the border, styling the Ranas as ardent supporters of Gorkha nationalism against foreign domination."
 NEP_empowerment_of_the_council_of_ministers: "Empowerment of the Council of Ministers"
 NEP_empowerment_of_the_council_of_ministers_desc: "With the replacement of the King the executive branch is now under our total control, with the Prime Minister and his cabinet steering the ship of state unopposed. To cement this change the Council of Ministers must be given greater leeway to shape the nation’s future course."
 NEP_remove_vestiges_of_royal_authority: "Remove Vestiges of Royal Authority"
 NEP_remove_vestiges_of_royal_authority_desc: "While King Samarayja understands his position there is no guarantee that future Kings will not make foolish and hasty decisions. In order to protect the dignity of the royal house we must make it clear that the nominal powers that Kings once held in Nepal are now held by the Prime Minister and his loyal government. This nation answers to the Ranas and nothing will ever change that."
 NEP_reorganise_decaying_ministries: "Reorganise Decaying Ministries"
 NEP_reorganise_decaying_ministries_desc: "While we have already cleared Nepal's institutions of its enemies there remains much waste and fruitless effort within the government that can be eliminated. Additionally we can use this opportunity to reward those who remained loyal and punish those who chose to do nothing in our hour of need, even if they never stood against us."
 NEP_establish_a_controlled_legislature: "Establish a Controlled Legislature"
 NEP_establish_a_controlled_legislature_desc: "Having plainly displayed their mastery over the state the gracious Prime Minister is prepared to grant his subjects the gift of representation, with the most capable and loyal being selected from across the nation to assist our wise rulers in governing. Truly the Ranas are the most generous of rulers."
 NEP_absolute_power_of_the_prime_minister: "Absolute Power of the Prime Minister"
 NEP_absolute_power_of_the_prime_minister_desc: "A ship needs one captain and a nation one leader, to serve the ship of state is to act with absolute obedience to the will of the Prime Minister. The Ranas have ruled in this fashion for almost a century to now and will rule in this fashion for a century more, now without the need to disguise or dilute their power by concession to the weak and unworthy. The Ranas are Nepal and to deny this is to deny reality."

 NEP_our_ruler_glorious: "Our Ruler Glorious"
 NEP_our_ruler_glorious_desc: "A hundred years of usurpation has been brought to an end by the hand of our glorious King Tribhuvan! Transforming the Dominion and Republic’s attempts to turn Nepal into a weapon against the other into a powerful tool to gain the support of elements of both the Mukti Sena and the Rana government, the King is once more at the forefront of Nepal’s politics and government."
 NEP_his_majestys_loyal_government: "His Majesty's Loyal Government"
 NEP_his_majestys_loyal_government_desc: "With the King’s restoration, Nepal now stands truly independent, not under the iron fist of a corrupt Rana tyrant who bends the knee to the British, nor under radical socialists, beholden to the government in Calcutta but truly its own country. We must move quickly to take advantage of this situation and establish a government loyal to the King and his designs for the country."
 NEP_restoring_power_to_the_sovereign: "Restoring Power to the Sovereign"
 NEP_restoring_power_to_the_sovereign_desc: "Under the Ranas the King became a mere symbol through which they maintained control over the country. With a government finally loyal to the King we will rebuild the practical authority of Nepal’s sovereign to govern."
 NEP_compromise_with_the_ranas: "Compromise with the Ranas"
 NEP_compromise_with_the_ranas_desc: "While the years of Rana rule were regrettable, individual Ranas remain as capable and influential figures that we would be foolish to ignore. With the looming threat of socialism it will not be difficult to make the concessions necessary to bring remnants of the old order into our service."
 NEP_empowering_local_councils: "Empowering Local Councils"
 NEP_empowering_local_councils_desc: "The King is only one man and the government can only be so extensive in a country like ours. Empowering local councils to handle their own concerns will allow the King and his government to focus more on national priorities while also creating a sense of responsive government."
 NEP_a_state_that_serves_its_people: "A State that Serves Its People"
 NEP_a_state_that_serves_its_people_desc: "For too long the state has been administered as though its purpose is to secure the benefit of a few powerful figures, to the ruin of all others. Now empowered, King Tribhuvan, in his great wisdom, understands that the duty of the state and of its rulers is to see to the wellbeing of its peple and works tirelessly in that spirit."
 NEP_ensure_royal_control_of_the_army: "Ensure Royal Control of the Army"
 NEP_ensure_royal_control_of_the_army_desc: "Now that the period of symbolic rule is over it is crucial that the King reestablish direct royal authority over the military. Under no circumstances can a future usurper be allowed to use the forces meant to protect the Kingdom for its destruction."
 NEP_forming_an_elected_assembly: "Forming an Elected Assembly"
 NEP_forming_an_elected_assembly_desc: "The most important priority in stabilising Nepal is giving the people a voice. It is only by working with and for the people and their legitimate representatives that we can bring Nepal out of the tyranny of Rana misrule."
 NEP_royally_appointed_bharadari_sabha: "Royally Appointed Bharadari Sabha"
 NEP_royally_appointed_bharadari_sabha_desc: "While we have made significant concessions to popular rule it is in the best interests of the Kingdom that any popularly elected assembly should be kept in check to prevent the outbreak of mob rule. For this purpose we will create an appointed upper house of the legislature, staffed by people chosen by the King for their competence and wisdom."
 NEP_prioritise_the_need_for_education: "Prioritise the Need for Education"
 NEP_prioritise_the_need_for_education_desc: "For Nepal to have a bright future its people must be ready to deal with the challenges of the modern world. The core of achieving such a prepared population is education, equipping the populous with knowledge and skills that will serve them and Nepal for years to come."
 NEP_under_the_courageous_sovereign: "Under the Courageous Sovereign"
 NEP_under_the_courageous_sovereign_desc: "While others sought to take power by turning to outsiders only the King had the courage to rise to the occasion rather than kneel before those who see Nepal as a means towards their own ends. The restoration has laid the groundwork for Nepal to enter an age of prosperity and security on its own terms."

 NEP_the_unshackling_of_nepal: "The Unshackling of Nepal"
 NEP_the_unshackling_of_nepal_desc: "At last Rana tyrants have been overthrown, the Mukti Sena have taken the capital, and the nation can finally look forward instead of backwards. For the first time in many years the future of Nepal is a bright one, led not by one man but by the people."
 NEP_formation_of_the_interim_government: "Formation of the Interim Government"
 NEP_formation_of_the_interim_government_desc: "The success of our revolution belongs as much to the monarchy as it does to the socialists and the people still stand with their King in the face of an uncertain future. With some remaining stubborn to this reality it falls on the Parishad to take a leading role alongside the King in Nepal’s transition to Democracy."
 NEP_a_democratic_maha_sabha: "A Democratic Maha Sabha"
 NEP_a_democratic_maha_sabha_desc: "Following the bicameral model of other democratic countries Nepal will establish an upper chamber to its legislature, selected by the people. This upper chamber will provide a check on the power of the lower chamber and work with it and the King to govern the nation."
 NEP_honour_the_legacy_of_the_martyrs: "Honour the Legacy of the Martyrs"
 NEP_honour_the_legacy_of_the_martyrs_desc: "All those who died in pursuit of a brighter future, all those who fought and perished in the battle to end Rana tyranny, all those who have died for Nepal will be honored for their heroism and sacrifice so that future generations may know to look to them as an example."
 NEP_uplift_nepal_into_the_20th_century: "Uplift Nepal Into the 20th Century"
 NEP_uplift_nepal_into_the_20th_century_desc: "The future of Nepal lies with the course set down by the Praja Parishad. With joining the modern world, building wealth and honoring religion, making Nepal one of the advanced countries of the world, and making the pride of the people in their country echo in every direction for thousands of years."

 NEP_loyalty_to_the_liberators: "Loyalty to the Liberators"
 NEP_loyalty_to_the_liberators_desc: "Nepal’s revolution would not have been possible without the support of our friends in Calcutta. In our darkest hour, when the cold grip of the Ranas seemed a fact of life for Nepal, they sheltered and supported the Mukti Sena and nurtured Nepal’s freedom. While the Parishad is certainly more amenable to the King than the socialists, it is clear that Kathmandu’s future lies with Calcutta."
 NEP_the_monarchy_problem: "The Monarchy Problem"
 NEP_the_monarchy_problem_desc: "In dealing with the monarchy we find ourselves caught between our principles, our allies and the realities of the coalition which brought us to power in the first place. Sooner rather than later we will be forced to decide if the King has any place at all in the future of Nepal."
 NEP_dethrone_the_landlords: "Dethrone the Landlords"
 NEP_dethrone_the_landlords_desc: "The first priority of the socialist revolution in any predominantly rural country is taking control over the land away from landlords and aristocrats. Granting land to the tiller not only breaks the powerbase of a reactionary class it also earns the loyalty and support of the Kisan who stand to gain greatly from the abolition of their masters."
 NEP_research_support_from_india: "Research Support From India"
 NEP_research_support_from_india_desc: "Though our ambitions lay with the modern world, for now Nepal remains woefully behind the times. In rectifying this our own efforts must be paired with the full cooperation and support of our allies in Calcutta. Only then can Nepal begin to aim for a place in modernity."
 NEP_glorify_the_kisan: "Glorify the Kisan"
 NEP_glorify_the_kisan_desc: "If the glory of the nation belongs to any it is not to the individual, living or dead, but to the downtrodden class whose wealth has built the palaces of aristocrats and whose produce has fed the armies of princes and kings. It is the Kisan who serve as the foundation and pillars of Nepal and the Kisan for whom we will build Nepal’s future."
 NEP_the_land_of_red_mountains: "The Land of Red Mountains"
 NEP_the_land_of_red_mountains_desc: "What only a short time ago would have seemed impossible has come to pass. The vestiges of feudalism and reaction have fallen across the mountains and valleys of Nepal, replaced by the brilliant banners of socialism and modernity, flying high overhead and dyeing the land beneath in brilliant red."

 NEP_sweep_away_the_ranas_greed: "Sweep Away the Ranas' Greed"
 NEP_sweep_away_the_ranas_greed_desc: "With the establishment of a new government the time has come to do away with the last remnants of the corruption and nepotism of the Ranas which have stolen so much from Nepal. The age of kleptocracy which impoverished the nation will be swept away, never to return."
 NEP_developing_panchayat_self_governance: "Developing Panchayat Self Governance"
 NEP_developing_panchayat_self_governance_desc: "In seeking a blueprint for Nepal's future we have the great fortune to share one of the oldest systems of local self government in the world and one that fits with our democratic principles. Developing and empowering this system will not only allow us to modernize local government but also to gain the support and cooperation of trusted local institutions."
 NEP_establishment_of_the_pradhan_nyayalaya: "Establishment of the Pradhan Nyayalaya"
 NEP_establishment_of_the_pradhan_nyayalaya_desc: "For the construction of a democratic future the independence of a judiciary is a vital step. By creating a responsible Pradhan Nyayalaya we ensure that the law is beyond weaponization by partisan leaders and would be tyrants."
 NEP_protection_of_the_fundamental_principles: "Protection of Fundamental Principles"
 NEP_protection_of_the_fundamental_principles_desc: "Without the principles of justice and human dignity that drove us, the revolution for which we fought against the Ranas is an empty grab for power. It is therefore our highest duty as participants in the revolution to follow and defend these fundamental principles from any attack and to construct which will protect them in turn."

 NEP_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "For almost a century Nepal has been ruled by the iron fist of the Rana dynasty, crushing all dissent and turning the nation's monarchy into little more than a puppet institution. Even in the aftermath of the Indian revolution, the steady hand of the Rana prime ministers saw it avoid a similar fate to their British allies, with any potential opposition swiftly dealt with.\n\nHowever with mounting tensions in India, and the neighbouring Republic in Calcutta preparing for its return to the warpath, it is beginning to seem like the Ranas may be set to face their largest threat yet."

 NEP_increase_BHC_influence_ranas_desc: "Even with the rebellion brewing we cannot be expected to live in a permanent state of fear.

Growing up under the regency of Queen Mother Divyeshwari Lakshmi Devi, at age 12 he married Kanti Rajya Lakshmi Devi Shah and her sister Ishwari on the same day in two separate ceremonies.\n\nIn spite of being the head of the Royal House of Gorkha (also known as the Shah Dynasty), while growing up neither Tribhuvan nor his mother held any real governing power, with the Ranas holding an iron grip on real governance. During the Great War, he and his mother were threatened and intimidated into ordering the Nepali troops to war in support of Britain and the Entente's efforts, deepening the mutual animosity between the two families.§!\n\n"

At the age of 14, he joined the army of the British Raj as a member of the elite Gurkha Brigades before eventually siding with the Calcutta Government, fighting with Indian rebel troops against British Indian forces.\n\nAs the Bharatiya People's Republic licked its wounds and celebrated its hard-fought freedom after the ceasefire of 1927, Ram soon imagined what such a revolution might look like in his homeland of Nepal. For much of the 20s and 30s he has collaborated with his fellow revolutionaries and tirelessly worked to instill politicial consciousness amidst the Nepalese peasantry.\n\nAfter the years of efforts from him and his comrades, the Nepalese Revolution has finally come to pass and his countrymen have been liberated from the shackles of despotic Rana feudalism. Closely associated with the INC, many doubt the youthful Ram will stray far from the party line of his cohorts in India.§!"

Growing up, Tanka maintained a very close relationship with his mother, and would come to be highly influenced by not only her moral teachings, but also those of the Hindu faith. Astrologically born between the Sukra and Brihaspati signs, their \"materialistic\" and \"spiritual\" influences have led many to predict he will some day become a Raja (king) or a Jogi (saint), expectations which have deeply affected him to this day.\n\nAt a very young age, his father uncovered corruption in one of his subordinates, however this subordinate was acquitted, with Tika being made to pay a hefty fine as the supervisor by the Ranas. Since then, Tanka has held a deep hatred for them, and would become obsessed with politics, culminating in the founding of the Nepal Praja Parishad.\n\nConsidering himself a man of the present, Tanka sees his past as a mere antiquity and so too does he see Nepal's feudal past the same way. Tanka plans to assert Nepal's independence and lead it into the modern age, even if such a task is going to prove tremendously difficult.§!"

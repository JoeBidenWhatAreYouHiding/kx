### Leaders ###
POLITICS_YUNNAN_TANG_JIYAO_DESC:0 "A loyal follower of General Cai E, Tang began his political career in 1911, when Cai E ordered him to take part in the Wuchang Uprising, begining the Xinhai Revolution. After the success of the revolution, he became governor of Guizhou and would later return to his home province of Yunnan in 1913 to replace Cai E. When Yuan Shikai announced his ambitions of becoming an Emperor, Tang immediately seceded with the support of the likes of Cai E and Li Liejun, who would spearhead the National Protection War alongside Tang. With their victory in the National Protection War, Yunnan became one of the main hegemons of the continent.\nSince then, Yunnan's glory days have long since faded away. Tang has led one failed expedition after another, with his failure in defeating Sichuan causing him to almost be deposed by Gu Pinzhen in a coup d'etat in 1921. However, the failure of the Northern Expedition became a blessing for Tang's control over Yunnan. With the threat of the Zhili Clique and their German Patrons looming in the distance, the presence of the surviving NRA members as well as Tang's own forces have largely deterred them from taking action against a seemingly hostile Republican province. However, Tang's flamboyant and over ambitious character have largely alienated many of the officers residing in Yunnan, and his control over the province is much weaker than it seems from the outside."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_ZHU_PEIDE_DESC:0 "A scion of a distinguished Lufeng family, Zhu Peide could trace among his ancestors proud servants to the Ming Dynasty and loyal administrators of the Qing Empire. Despite his lineage, he aligned himself to Dr Sun Yat-sen's cause as a zealous and scholarly revolutionary. After a brief stint in Jiangxi as the province's chairman and a lengthy career in the Kuomintang, Zhu Peide fled into exile after the KMT's failed Northern Expedition. Alongside most of the remaining 3rd NRA army, he returned back to his home region of Yunnan, beginning to build up a new career within Tang Jiyao's administration.\nWhen Tang's government fell, Zhu Peide seized the opportunity to rally the remnants of the Rightist Kuomintang and denounce Long Yun's takeover. Alongside his comrades, he marched west for Kunming and lead a successful takeover. Now comfortably seated in the capital of Yunnan, he has sworn to rebuild a National Government, honouring Sun Yat-Sen's legacy."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LU_HAN_DESC:0 "Rumours have long circulated that Lu Han was the alleged half-brother of Long Yun, which is said to have been one of the reasons behind the two men's close comradeship. Whether that is the truth or not, it seems that whatever bond of blood or friendship existed between the two was not thick enough to prevent Lu Han from seizing this latest opportunity. The young Yi general has served with the Kuomintang, fought with the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang of Indochina, and now lead a daring coup against his former comrades. Lu has desperately gathered his forces in the capital and has set out to weather the coming storm. Yet the men around him wonder: can a man who betrayed his own supposed brother really be trusted?"
POLITICS_YUNNAN_HU_RUOYU_DESC:0 "The new administration was not to last, as the men who ousted Tang Jiyao have now turned their knives and guns on each other. Hu Ruoyu has made the first move, making a play to control the capital with the aid of his small band of followers. Unlike his peers, Hu came from a privileged family of scholars and landlords, yet found himself drawn to the revolutionary politics of the early 20th century. Under the patronage of Tang Jiyao, he climbed the ranks of the Yunnanese Army, eventually landing a comfortable position in the Kunming Military staff. With deep pockets and close connections to the officers and garrisons of the capital, Hu has made a risky gamble to oust and arrest his co-conspirators, proclaiming himself as Yunnan's new leader. Now time will tell if that risk will pay off..."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LONG_YUN_DESC:0 "In his youth, Long Yun became inspired by the radical Anti-Qing student movements among his peers at the Yunnan Military Academy. He joined a local militia and fought in the Xinhai revolution, climbing through the ranks until he was serving under Tang Jingyu as commander of the Fifth Army, within the Yunnan Clique. His rise to power was helped by the close comradeship he held with his superior, as well as his alleged half-brother Lu Han. Yet in time, these friendships would be tainted with political rivalry and a heated competition for power in the declining revolutionary movement. It has taken many sacrifices, many betrayals and certainly regrets, yet Long Yun has now risen to lead the Yunnan Clique as its new warlord.\nLong's hold over Yunnan is tenuous but determined, he holds plenty of ambitions to remain a leading figurehead for the coming years, yet just like how he ousted his predecessor there's a distinct risk his own subordinates could turn on him at any minute. This is not helped by Long's ethnic background as a member of the Yi minority, although it has helped foster friendships between his administration and his kinsfolk. A pragmatist, an outsider to the Han political elite, and an ambitious warlord: 'The Dragon of Yunnan' may be a force for China to reckon with."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_ZHU_DE_DESC:0 "Famed as a man who rose from humble beginnings, Zhu De was nothing bit a dirt poor peasant, a simple tenant farmer in the Sichuan countryside. At nine years of age, he was taken in by a wealthy uncle and later sent to study at Yunnan Military Academy. His time at the academy saw him enlist in the Tongmenhui, the predecessor to the Kuomintang. The next years in Zhu De's life were a turbulent series of travels throughout China, fighting at various revolutionary fronts with the National Republican Army, serving various political factions and building up a great network of connections. From Sichuan to Shanghai, Tibet and even a brief stint as a student in Berlin, the roads of fate eventually lead Zhu De back to Yunnan. In recent years he fell afoul of the warlord Tang Jiyao's despotism, being driven to resign his position in the National Republican Army and promise to abstain from politics rather than face an umpteenth journey around the Asian continent.\nZhu De had perhaps expected to spend the rest of his life as a teacher at the Yunnan Military Academy, yet the news that Tang's government had fallen, and that all hell was breaking loose in Yunnan convinced him resurface from obscurity. Outwitting and outlasting the failed would-be despots of Yunnan, Zhu has set out with a simple goal, to here in Yunnan build the moral and responsible democratic institutions which he has studied, taught and dreamed of."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LI_XIN_DESC:0 "Li Xin initially attended a German Private school in Kunming, where after he would study at various universities around the country. He first studied agronomy in Nanjing's South Eastern University, but was transferred to Beijing Agriculture University. During his stay in the Northern capital he became increasingly interested by foreign political thought, studying the failed Bolshevik movement in Russia and the now ascendant Syndicalist ideology in Europe. Throughout the 20s he grew increasingly closer to Syndicalism and later with other radical students at the university to form a political group named the "Renovation Society" in order to promote leftist views. After graduating in 1926, he travelled to Guangzhou and attended a lecture held by the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang on Agricultural Socialism. Although Li was at this point enamoured with Syndicalism, he accepted a request from the political representatives to join the Communist Party and help organise a political movement back in his home province of Yunnan. Dubbed the "Yunnan Special Branch", this group was initially meant to collaborate with its superiors but lost contact with the mother party following the failure of the Northern Expedition.\nLi, as one of the key figures in the group began to apply the same ideological currents which had dominated the Renovation Society, building an underground intellectual society of Syndicalist radicals in the heart of Kunming. This lead to a large schism between those loyal to the Special Branch's original beliefs, and Li's Syndicalist influence, eventually leading to Li's party founding 'Xindianshe' or 'The New Society' as a separate group. Despite his revolutionary convictions, Li has managed to remain below the radar of Tang's government. Initially several warlords in Yunnan were aware of his leftist beliefs, but had little reason to persecute a simple agricultural scholar. That all changed when Li Xin journeyed to various Yunnanese tin mines, hoping to organize the workers into a union. He even disguised himself as a miner, toiling away in hopes of growing closer to the proletariat. After organizing a wildcat strike in 1929 Li was almost arrested and executed, which forced him to go into hiding. Since then he has continued to grow his political influence, hoping to once more unite the Yunnanese workers and show the warlords what power truly lies in the hands of the proletariat."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_WANG_FUSHENG_DESC:0 "Wang's life was uneventful until he was admitted to Beijing University's Liberal Arts program. Early on he began to associate with radical student groups, getting to know several influential figures such as Li Xin and Li Dazhou. While many of his comrades dabbled in studying the newly resurgent Syndicalist movement that was sweeping through Europe and America, Wang remained a committed Marxist. He later joined Li Xin's "Renovation Society", a leftist group which promoted socialist ideology at Beijing University. During this time he witnessed many of his comrades be repressed, arrested and even executed by the Beijing government, driving him down a vengeful and authoritarian path. Much like his colleague Li Xin, he met with members of the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang, being similarly instructed to travel back to Yunnan and organize socialists within the province. The hope was to topple the warlord Tang Jiyao's hold over the south west, by founding a 'Yunnan Special Branch' of the Communist Party that could ferment revolution.\nYet the Special Branch was nearly annihilated when the Northern Expedition failed, and its superiors among the CPC and Leftist Kuomintang ended up scattered to the wind. Worst of all for Wang, his own comrades now began to turn on him. Rejecting the old authorities they had followed and beginning to rally around Li Xin's own syndicalist views. Outraged, Wang seized control of the special branch and moved to expel Li. During his tenure as leader of the underground revolutionary society, he worked to regain contact with whatever remnants of the Kuomintang or CPC might still be organized and continuing the fight in China. After years of silence and falls leads, he finally found them. The ZhongTeJu, and through a series of secret meetings, encoded messages and risky plans, the Yunnan Special Branch was restored to its original purpose: To ferment revolution against the Yunnan warlords. Despite his new superiors and the schism with his old comrades, Wang remains diligently committed to one single goal, revolution before all."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_Bai_Chongxi_DESC:0 "A muslim man from the Hui people, Bai Chongxi claims descent from a family of Persian merchants who settled in Sichuan. He attended the Guangxi Military Cadre Training School under a ground-breaking modernized curriculum as part of wider reforms within the Chinese military. This cutting edge knowledge would serve him well when he made a name for himself serving in a Guangxi student militia, later climbing the ranks to become one of the most influential generals in the Warlord Era. A loyal supporter of Sun Yat-sen's vision for a democratic China, he was part of the triumvirate known as the New Guangxi Clique, which sought to overthrow Lu Rongting's regional warlord government. Unfortunately, the collapse of the Northern Expedition and the German intervention in China would lead to the New Guangxi Clique snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, fleeing in exile alongside many other Kuomintang members to Yunnan. Since then, he has worked to train a new generation of officers, passing down the book smarts he learned in Guangxi, and the bitter lessons the Northern Expedition has taught him."

POLITICS_YUNNAN_JIN_HANDING_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1887\nYuxi, Yunnan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nRenowned as a war hero who distinguished himself during general Cai E's march into Sichuan, Jin Handing once had a bright career ahead of him. In 1922 he was appointed acting governor of Yunnan as part of the leadup to the Northern Expedition. After a mere month in office Jin was pressured to resign by Tang Jiyao in a political soft coup. Having lost his prestigious position in Yunnan, he attached himself to Chiang Kai Chek's forces, but the Kuomintang's failed military campaign put another stop to Jin's ambitions. Facing obscurity or exile, the young commander was surprised to see his usurper, Tang Jiyao extend an olive branch after the Manchu Restoration and invite him back to Kunming. With a desperate need for competent, republican generals, Jin and Tang have to overlook their mutual distaste for each other and prepare for the inevitable confrontation with their northern enemy. As the democratic forces lick their found, Jin has also had the chance to reunite with some old friends, such as his former classmate Zhu De. In addition to his military work, Jin Handing is also a renowned teetotaller, leading a political campaign against the mass consumption of tobacco, opium and alcohol within the National Republican Army."

Despite this unruly nature, he joined the military and became a renowned and obedient soldier. During this time, he was noticed by Tang Jiyao and promoted to a higher position, climbing the ranks through the National Republican Army until he had the honour of serving as Dr Sun Yat-sen's bodyguard. During the Northern Expedition, he was wounded in combat and hospitalized, an event that likely saved his life during the disastrous military campaign. After recovering, he joined his exiled comrades in Yunnan, making use of his friendship with Tang to easily join the warlord's inner circle of confidants."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_TANG_HUAIYUAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1886\nYuxi, Yunnan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAfter losing his father at an early age, Tang Huaiyuan was lifted out of poverty when a committee of provincial examiners from the Qing administration remarked upon his clever wits and studious nature. Tang was recommended to the Yunnan Military Academy, becoming famed as a child prodigy. Although he initially participated in the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, he did not serve at the frontlines. Instead, he worked as a teacher and military educator. Like many of his comrades, he fled to Yunnan when news arrived of Chiang Kai Chek's death. While more accustomed to discussing strategy and teaching he was recently urged to return to the officer staff by the Yunnan Clique's warlord, Tang Jiyao."

He studied medicine and worked as a teacher, until his friend Li Hongxiang introduced him to general Cai E. Already enamoured with the revolutionary movement, Fan abandoned his academic career and joined Cai's army. The constant struggles and repeated failures of the Kuomintang to consolidate their hold over China eventually lead Fan to retire from the military, taking up work as a doctor in Kunming. He was content to remain as an apolitical civilian, until he caught Tang Jiyao's attention. Already familiar with each other from their time in the revolution, Tang managed to convince his old comrade to return to the army. Fan has now traded in his robes and rickshaw for a uniform and rifle, attaching himself to the recovering republican movement."

After graduating from the Kunming Academy in 1924, he decided to join the KMT in Guangzhou and continued his study at the Whampoa Military Academy. However, frustrated with the hidden corruption within the Nationalist Government, he left for Shanghai to work after graduation. In 1929, he was invited back to Yunnan to serve as a tutor in the Kunming Academy. Since then, he has become a leader of the progressive wing of young Republican officers in the Kunming Academy, calling for anti-corruption and reducing poverty."

POLITICS_YUNNAN_ZHAO_XINGWU_DESC:0 "Zhao travelled to Kunming and attended Yunnan Law School in 1917. Although he was too young to participate in the Xinhai Revolution or the National Protection War, the stories of what was happening around China thrilled him. During his stay in Kunming he began reading political literature, both the more mainstream democratic manifestos but also digging into forbidden communist propaganda that had been outlawed under the warlord Tang Jiyao's rule. After attempting to organize political activities among his fellow students, he was expelled from the school. Outraged at this censorship, Zhao decided to leave Yunnan and join the Kuomintang's armies to the east. During the coming military campaigns he served as an officer under Zhu Peide, distinguishing himself thanks to his analytical mind and aptitude for strategic thinking. It was also around this time he first joined the Communist Party of China, but his hopes of working with fellow socialists both within the party and the Kuomintang was short lived. The failure of the Northern Expedition broke the democratic and socialist movements in southern China, forcing Zhao to flee back to Yunnan alongside his superior Zhu Peide. During his exile, he distanced himself from both the other rightist Kuomintang exiles. He began to correspond and meet with various members of the now scattered leftists, becoming a key liaison to them in Yunnan. Zhao has gone from leading students, soldiers and now exiles, but despite it all he still maintains a great skill for leadership and a zealous devotion to socialist ideals."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_GONG_SHOU_DESC:0 "The latest in a long line of Yi Tusi, a form of regional hereditary chieftain in the old imperial bureaucracy, Gong Shou rose to prominence thanks to his unscrupulous political flexibility and zealous defence of the southern minorities' autonomy. Although initially born with the name Dāo Yuè Chūn, he served as Tusi of the Nandian Prefecture up until the Xinhai Revolution. Sensing political change sweeping through China, Shou changed his name to Gong and began to promote an elaborate story that his family were in reality descendants of Ming dynasty soldiers who had occupied Yunnan. The decision to pass himself off as a member of the Han ethnicity earned Shou a considerable degree of influence in the post-revolutionary political climate, which he used to campaign against the attempted land reforms that would weaken the Yi people and their Tusi's autonomy. Although it landed him a stint in prison, he was later released and continued to live with this unique ethnic duality, spending some days as the Han politician Gong Shou and others as the Yi Chieftain Dao YueChun."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_CHEN_GUOFU_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 27th, 1892, in Huzhou Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gChen Guofu spent his early life in the shadow of his famous uncle Chen Qimei, one of the founders of the Republic of China, ally of Sun Yat-sen, and mentor to Chiang Kai shek. Under his uncle’s guidance, Chen joined the Tongmenghui and participated in the Xinhai Revolution.\n\nHaving met his uncle’s protege Chiang Kai shek, the two became close friends and worked together extensively after Chen Qimei was assassinated in 1916. In 1920, Chen Guofu operated in the Shanghai Stock Exchange alongside Chiang in order to fund the Kuomintang. Chen Guofu found his fortunes increase with Chiang’s elevation to Headmaster of Sun’s Whampoa Military Academy, with Chen put in charge of military recruitment in Shanghai.\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition turned into a disaster and Chen’s old friend Chiang was killed, he and his brother fled Guangzhou for Yunnan province where the remnants of the Kuomintang had consolidated. Chen Guofu has become prominent voices in the Kuomintang’s right wing, staunchly opposing the Central Executive Committee’s alliance with syndicalist forces. With Chen Guofu now in a dominant position in the Kuomintang and his brother at his side, he will not see Sun Yat-sen’s National Revolution fall to such darkness. No, he will reshape the National Revolution in honour of Chiang Kai shek, Chen Qimei, and all Nationalist martyrs who have given their lives for China’s future.§!"
POLITICS_YUNNAN_CHEN_CHENG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gJanuary 4th, 1898, in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, Qing Empire§!\nBorn into a traditional peasant family that had been farming for generations, Chen attended Gaoshi Primary School in 1906. In 1912, after Chen's graduation, the dire economic situation within his family forced Chen to ingeniously take the initiative in his own education.\n\nSuch initiative and capability has continued to be an ever present element within Chen Cheng's life, as after a failed attempt to study at the Japanese Army Sergeant School in 1917, and another failed attempt to apply for Baoding Military Academy in 1918, he persisted and was finally admitted to the Eigth Artillery Section of Baoding Military Academy. After the fallout of the Zhili-Anhui war in 1920, Chen Cheng was forced to flee southwards where he found himself in the Third Regiment of the newly-established Guangdong Army's First division, joining the Kuomintang thereafter.\n\nDeveloping a student-teacher relationship with National Revolutionary Army general Deng Yanda during his time in Baoding, Chen found himself abandoning his new post as a trainee officer in Zhejiang upon hearing that Deng was recruiting officers for a new army in Guangzhou, ignoring military discipline and departing to Shanghai to join with his old mentor. Serving dutifully as lieutenant-adjutant and company commander of the Third Regiment of the First Division of the NRA, he later served as a bodyguard to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, being shot in the chest during his service. It was during the recovery from such a wound that Chen Cheng would meet the late Chiang Kai-shek, his future mentor.\n\nHaving been appointed artillery science instructor and artillery captain at Huangpu Military Academy, Chen would follow on to be appointed as commander of the NRA's first artillery battalion, participating successfully in the Eastern Expedition, receiving key praise from Chiang for his performance, even earning the nickname \"Three Cannons\"\n\nParticularly close towards both Chiang Kai-shek and Deng Yanda, the loss of the former during the catastrophic Northern Expedition led to rapid disarray as German boots crushed the KMT. During the chaos, Chen Cheng would find himself following the remnants of the Right Kuomintang into Guizhou, hoping one day to conclude Dr. Sun's dream."

These expeditions have come at a price, which Tang has been happy to pay with an expansion of the Opium trade and high taxes for the peasantry. This has triggered a slow but steady growth in civil unrest in the province, at the same time as once loyal generals and newly-found rivals now team up to scheme against Tang, preparing for the perfect time to strike. Nevertheless, with his sights set on expanding Yunnan's borders and with a weakening grip of the German government over Chinese affairs, Tang may hold greater ambitions for the mountainous province..."

While Tin trade is incredibly profitable, there are major issues with our tin production which greatly reduce the income we receive from it. These revolve around a lack of purity in our tin, which we are unable to fix with our current equipment, which in turn forces us to sell it to the Germans at outrageously low prices. This cheap tin is then taken to the AOG where it is re-smelted to improve its purity, and then resold in the international market at a higher price. If we ever hope to take those profits back from the German monopolies, significant reform will have to be undertaken, and our economy may not be ready for such an endeavour..."

### Events ###
yun.1.t:0 "Status of the Yunnan Clique"
yun.1.d:0 "The decision to found Yunnan Military Academy in 1909 gave birth to the Yunnan clique. Since the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, the province of Yunnan has been known for its elite army and loyalty to Chinese republicanism. In 1915, Yunnan alone declared the National Protection War against Yuan Shikai and toppled his empire. The victorious Yunnan then pursued an expansionist policy, exerting control over its neighbours. The ephemeral Yunnan hegemony came at a price however, losing control of many units deployed outside of Yunnan. The military adventure in Sichuan was a failure and caused a major civil conflict within the Yunnan clique. General Gu Pinzhen temporarily ousted Tang Jiyao from power, but Tang regrouped and returned with his loyal troops, managing to secure victory and Gu. However, since then the Yunnan army has no longer been an integral force. Old classmates and brothers-in-arms rapidly became rivals.\n\nDuring the Northern Expedition, Yunnan's leading warlord Tang Jiyao kept a distance from Guangzhou KMT government, while other Yunnan troops in exile, led by general Zhu Peide, rallied behind the banner of National Revolution and became the pillar of Sun Yat-Sen's military force. When the Northern Expedition tragically ended, the desperate generals of the National Revolutionary Army decided to return to the South back to Yunnan. The attrition was heavy, and many of them ended up at the door of Guizhou, Tang's newly conquered land. Tang wanted to seize the chance and annihilate his old enemies right there, but his generals, led by Long Yun, strong-armed Tang into offering sanctuary to the defeated NRA. The coexistence of former rivals is not easy, but they knew the new ruler of China. The Zhili clique and their German patrons will not tolerate an autonomous Yunnan, and they can only survive through cooperation. Despite its formidable battle commanders and elite army, the lack of a unified command authority has costed Yunnan dearly when it audaciously joined the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war.\n\nAs a new year starts for the southern province, Tang Jiyao's authority over the clique is far from assured. His despotism and the blatant favouritism he displays for his incompetent brother, Tang Jiyu, alienates many high ranking officers, including Long Yun. The submission to Qing has also undermined his prestige and he holds nothing but nominal control over the former NRA troops. With the ever mounting political tension between the officers in Yunnan, Tang's next misstep may prove to be his last..."
yun.1.a:0 "How Exciting!"

yun.2.t:0 "Long Yun Takes Over!"
yun.2.d:0 "After gathering his troops at the south-eastern entrance of the city of Kunming, Long Yun led his troops through the East of the Dian Lake until breaking through the city's outer wall. Foreseeing an encirclement, Tang Jiyao attempted to flee northwards through the northern residential area in order to escape towards Sichuan, but was cut off by officers loyal to Long Yun before he was able to flee the city.\n\nWith the capture of Tang, the remaining loyal forces fighting Kunming surrendered before dawn, and a committee was hastily assembled by Long Yun in order to judge Tang. However, the coup has caused great upheaval amongst the many factions in Yunnan, and Tang's trial had to be rushed due to fear of him escaping custody in case of a clash near Kunming. Accused of endangering the people of Yunnan, overall incompetence as a leader, favouritism over capable officers, treason to the Republican ideals of the province and embezzlement of public funds, Tang was forced to sign his resignation and to retire from public life.\n\nThis isn't the end of Yunnan's woes, unfortunately. While Long Yun entrenches in the capital and reinforces the Kunming Arsenal and the Yunnan Military Academy, Zhu Peide in the South-East, Hu Ruoyu in the West and Lu Han in the North-East mobilize their forces for a final showdown for the control of Yunnan."

yun.3.t:0 "The Battle of Chuxiong"
yun.3.d:0 "With his enemies gathering from both sides, Long Yun has realized already that he cannot wait for his enemies to reach Kunming, or he'll be surrounded. Taking advantage of the Kunming Arsenal's supplies, Long Yun has decided to take the offensive westwards and secure Dali. However, the small town of Chuxiong stands in the way of Long Yun's conquest. With the enemy entrenching in the city, and few bridges where the defenders can bottleneck the attackers, Long Yun and his officers are forced to rethink their strategy.\n\nA group of young officers argue that the best way to flush out the defenders is to surround the village along the Longchuan River, and then storm the village on all sides. Another group of more experienced officers have proposed to wait for artillery pieces to be moved forward, and give the defenders one last ultimatum: Surrender to Long Yun or face the consequences. As the final details of each plan is laid out, it's Long Yun who will decide what shall be the fate of the Chuxiong..."

yun.4.t:0 "The Battle of Qujing"
yun.4.d:0 "As Long Yun secures his power elsewhere, his enemies start converging in the east, threatening to retake Kunming while the bulk of his force remains in the west. Without a lot of troops to spare, the small town of Qujing has been chosen for the Kunming defenders to make a stand against the enemy\n\nHowever, the geography of the territory presents an interesting challenge for the defenders. If they protect the entrances to the main valley, they can look over the enemy routes into and out of the city by controlling the nearby mountains, but that would force the defenders to spread out. On the other hand, protecting the town itself could prove to be easier, as the enemies would face a more concentrated defender force which can fight tooth and nail for every street and every house, although it could lead to higher civilian casualties and the loss of the higher ground around the town, which could be used by enemy snipers to decimate our army. As Long Yun receives reports from runners that his East flank is exposed, he has decided to..."
yun.4.a:0 "Protect the valley's entrances, we need the high ground."
yun.4.b:0 "Fall back into Qujing, we need the extra ground to delay the enemy"

yun.5.t:0 "The Capture of Anshun"
yun.5.d:0 "As Long Yun marches through the north-eastern roads towards Qianzhong, he has sent a detachment southwards to secure the province of Guixi before facing off his enemies at Bijie. The harsh terrain in the area has made the officers leading the detachment increasingly wary of possible ambushes. However, as the detachment came close to the Nanma River, a small group of soldiers carrying a white flag approached the detachment.\n\nThe soldiers had been sent to negotiate by one of Long Yun's rivals, and requested to give the city another day in order to allow for the woman, the children and the elderly to be evacuated to a safe area. In exchange, the soldiers promised the defender forces would retreat as well, allowing the detachment to capture Anshun without firing a shot. The officers leading the expedition requested the soldiers to give them a few minutes to discuss the matter internally. While the proposition seems noble, Long Yun's officers are distrustful of the soldiers. They could be buying time for reinforcements to arrive from Qianzhong, and some even argue that a direct attack now, while costly for the civilian populace, would strike a killing blow at the factionalist forces. By the end of the deliberation, the officers told the soldiers sent to parley that..."
yun.5.a:0 "They are given a day to complete the evacuation, but no more"
yun.5.b:0 "The attack will begin in the afternoon and they should return before hostilities resume"

yun.6.t:0 "The Battle of Bijie"
yun.6.d:0 "After Long Yun's forces reach the Salaxizhen village, the valley opens up in several paths, of which the Central one leads directly towards Bijie. Long Yun's scouts have informed him that the city has been fortified and it's waiting for a direct frontal attack.\n\nWhile Long Yun can't abandon the main road as it would expose his forces to being flanked, he can split up his forces and lead a diversionary attack in the entrance of Bijie, while the bulk of the force is split and attacks through the north along the Daotian River and through the south following the Shibahe river. Many officers have objected to this plan, claiming that splitting the forces would make the overall army weaker, and since the valleys on the sides weren't secured, the detachments would risk facing a superior force and being decimated, while a direct frontal assault, while costly, could allow the army to punch through and ultimately scatter the bulk of the factionalist forces defending Bijie. At the end of the discussion, it's Long Yun who will have the final word."
yun.6.a:0 "Split our forces, we need to fight smart"
yun.6.b:0 "Concentrate our forces, we can punch through"

yun.7.t:0 "The Defence of Bijie"
yun.7.d:0 "After reports of factionalist forces gathering in the Guixi province, Long Yun has decided to take the initiative and take over the Qianzhong province in order to encircle and destroy his enemies. With a swift strike, the defenders of Bijie were no match for Long Yun's forces, but as the night slowly set in, it was decided for the detachment to rest in the town before continuing the march towards Zunyi in Qianzhong. However, during the night the forces have been caught off guard by an attacking force, and the defence of the town will have to come as a priority if the force wishes to reach its objectives.\n\nAn Attack coming through the Southern Entrance is slowly edging its way into the city, but the roads to the sides are also being attacked by an unknown number of attackers, and the detachment risks getting encircled in the city. As the chaos  ensues during the night firefight, orders come from Long Yun himself and the force decides to..."
yun.7.a:0 "Defend the roads, we need a way to escape"
yun.7.b:0 "Defend the City, we'll crush their main force first"

yun.8.d:0 "As our battered forces converge on the city of Guiyang, the South-Western army of Long Yun has to face an uphill battle as they have to cross the Honfeng Lake in order to reach Qingzheng and from there stage the final assault on Guiyang.\n\nAs the Northern Detachment reaches the northern entrance of Guiyang, the South-Western one is mostly pinned down at the crossings of the Hongfeng Lake and they are taking heavy casualties. However, most of the defending force has shifted towards Qingzheng, leaving Guiyang largely undefended. The issue arises now that the city could be hastily taken without clearing all enemies from it, risking a possible counter-attack from the rear as the bulk of the group is engaged in helping the South-Western detachment, but encircling the defending force in Qingzheng may prove to be decisive in order to swiftly beat the factionalist force before another group strikes at Kunming.

However, scouts have informed that a large enemy contingent is in the city and it is prepared to defend it. While a direct attack might prove effective, one of the scouts has pointed to a path through the southern forest of Fuben, which would allow us to storm the town from several directions, but would take time to get our troops into position, time which might be vital to retaking the area and securing our grip in the region..."

This advantage won't last forever, specially if the rebel forces manage to secure foreign support, and so General Ryuoyu has decreed a full scale offensive throughout the country. This offensive has managed to seize Guiyang and Zhaotong, finding little resistance along the way. However, these easy victories are overshadowed by an evident realization: Our enemies weren't retreating, they were regrouping. As our soldiers dig foxholes and our officers draw plans for the defence of both cities, we find ourselves with a severe supply shortage. With both cities in danger of being attacked by our enemies, we will have to choose which city to prioritize in order to give them the necessary supplies to defend it."

Due to our enemy's numerical advantage, General Hu Ruoyu has ordered his troops to lure the enemy into the city of Chuxiong, along the road between Kunming and Dali, and wait them there.\n\nMost of Hu Ruoyu's officers agree that an attack is imminent and preparing a defensive strategy would be best, but not how said defensive is meant to be carried out. One group of officers argue that a static defence on the Northern bank of the Longchuan river, paired up with trenches and small fortifications will be enough to repel the enemy. While usually the Weltkrieg textbooks with which the Kunming academy trains indicate that this model may be the best defence, our current shortage of Machine guns render this strategy weak in case the enemy outnumbers us, so another group of officers has recommended maybe adopting a more flexible defensive strategy, setting up several fallback lines and attracting the enemy into a protracted battle might be a better choice. Regardless of their discussion, Hu Ruoyu's orders is what settles the defensive plan."

yun.13.d:0 "As our soldiers marched on from the town of Bijie to face off the warlord forces near Zunyi, scouts have reported a large formation of enemies mobilizing to the Northwest of Zunyi, in one of the many valleys of our province. However, unlike most of the terrain in Yunnan, this area is mostly flat land, used mainly for agriculture, and a few spread forests. With barely any hills to overlook the enemy, and them having the advantage of being able to access cover, our only advantage is the surprise factor. After a long session of deliberations, Hu Ruoyu has ordered from the capital that the area must be taken in order to secure the advance towards Zunyi, regardless of the casualties. As our officers draw the plans, a question has come up: Considering the enemy cannot be destroyed, merely pushed back from the area, in what direction should our army try to push them towards? Some officers argue that pushing them north will put a strain on our rear guard as we will need to leave a considerable group to guard the area, and we would also be leaving them right next to the Sichuan Clique, which could try to support them to our detriment, but would separate them from the main fighting force. Other officers however, point out that perhaps pushing them off Eastwards while we still have the advantage will allow us to better make use of our tactical advantage. What should we do?"

Their leading officer has reported back to Kunming that their soldiers were outmanned and outgunned from the other side of the river, with even artillery fire raining over the area and has requested to retreat and regroup. While taking Baoshan and stopping the enemy forces from concentrating is vital for our survival, we can't risk another decisive defeat on the area or the enemy will grow bold and attack us where we are weak. Since we need to act fast, the message has to be dispatched as soon as possible."

However, with our limited resources and even more limited manpower, we have to choose whether to attack Bijie in order to take Qianzhong or move towards Guiyang in order to take Guixi. Both targets will prove tough nuts to crack, as our scouts have spotted Long Yun's forces near  Guiyang, and our KMT sympathisers have reported Zhu Peide moving towards Bijie. With both heading towards Kunming, we need to face one or the other before its too late and both converge on our position.

If this keeps up, they'll be at the gates of Kunming before the week is out. Our loyal officers have presented Lu Han with two choices: Reinforce the front and hope it will hold, or push Westwards towards Dali. While holding the front seems like a more immediate solution, we are stretched thin with our forces also being occupied with other battles in the East. By contrast, attacking westwards might be a gamble, but it'll likely force the enemy in Yuxi to retreat to try and prevent us from seizing the main cities of the West. Either way, the decision rests with Lu Han..."

However, Lu Han foresaw his rival, Zhu Peide, would move the Western Detachment of the NRA through the mountain pass in order to seize Baoshan and expose Dali to an attack. With little time to prepare as other warlord armies regroup, a defence has been hastily assembled but reports of a large enemy force approaching from the Nujiang River has made their officer panic and he is currently requesting to withdraw from the area to avoid getting encircled.

They have proposed to seize the surrounding areas to the town of Zunyi and then move downwards to Guiyang, but it's a very risky move and they'll have to act independently from our command.

With heavy casualties, they managed to get a small squadron to escape to Kunming to request for reinforcements, and chances are that the battle is still raging.

When we first marched into the capital, a significant group of our army remained in Wenshan, and with our forces now secure in Kunming, we can perform a pincer movement towards Qujing, where we have received reports from our allies in Anshun that a force is gathering to mount a counter-attack on Kunming. However, there are also reports of a force assembling in the old city of Dali, but redeploying our troops to cover the Western side may open us to the possibility of a two front attack, one that we may not be able to hold..."

In order to tackle them, a traditional static defence is already been setup, with machine guns and artillery pieces being brought from the city to the border of the Tanglang River. However, a few cavalry officers from the NRA have suggested we take the initiative away from the enemy. Instead of digging in, they propose we send one detachment northwards, towards the village of Yuanmou, and another southwards, following the Huanian River, and then have both move towards Chuxiong. As they put it, they'll be able to encircle the enemy before this one can pierce through our lines, but the plan is risky.

While relieving them is our top priority, there are many roads towards Zunyi, and the staff has found itself debating on which approach would be best for the situation. The faster path towards Zunyi would be through Bijie, which would be lightly defended and would allow us to relieve our forces faster, but taking a southern road towards Anshun and then Guiyang would allow us to catch the enemy force off-guard, although doing such a thing would require more time, time that the garrison in Zunyi may not have.

However, what was supposed to be a clean and quick capture of the city has turned into a siege, almost reminiscent of the siege the town was put through during the Panthay Rebellion almost a century prior. As the siege drags on, the Southern Group has sent a message back to Kunming asking for orders, as they may not meet the deadline to reach Zunyi if the Siege continues, but not finishing the Siege may expose the rear to a counter-attack from the town.

As our forces wait on the western bank of the Luojiang River, a report from the front line commanders have reached Kunming. Scout reports indicate that several trench lines, machine guns and even artillery pieces are aiming at the Western entrance of Zunyi, making a frontal assault nearly a suicide attack. Instead, a group of officers have suggested to take half the force north, to the Huichan valley entrance into Zunyi, and create a diversionary attack in order to give the frontal force time to attack. However, this move would take time, and the Southern Force could be fighting in the south before they make it, and our experts predict the southern area may also be fortified enough that it may completely halt the southern force if not relieved from our side in time..."

With these positions secured, Jin Handing then moved on to secure the commercial district in the east, while Zhu De secured the Kunming Cultural Area in the west. With the enemies on full retreat, only some loose defenders had been left on the city centre as Zhu De and Jin Handing began pushing towards the Cui Hu Park, securing the final capture of the city and the capitulation of the garrisoned forces.\n\nWith this victory, Zhu De has consolidated his position, and has proclaimed that he will bring stability back to the people of Yunnan, no matter the cost.

General Fan Shisheng, a close friend of Zhu De, was assigned to lead the an army group towards Dali and into the Cang Mountains. With a swift advance through Anning and Chuxiong, Shisheng managed to reach the southern gate of the old city of Dali, where they faced off a weary group of defenders. Weariness of the recent conflicts however had set in, and many of the enemy soldiers quickly deserted to join Zhu De's forces, with the city of Dali formally surrendering before midnight.

With the fall of Guiyang, the Bijie garrison surrendered before the assault on the city was conducted. The Qujing garrison was ordered to move forward towards Anshun by an emboldened Zhu De while Handing pushed southwards towards Anshun in order to perform a pincer movement and deal with the last rebel forces.

yun.45.d:0 "While not a popular move with the Han population, our government has deemed necessary to seek a new approach to our ethnic policy. With the endorsement of the Society of the Bamboo King, we have elevated the Society to a state organization, which shall create a united ethnic council which will coordinate the different ethnic minorities to oppose the Han slight majority and 'supervise' the creation and enforcement of ethnic equality laws which shall, hopefully, bring the ethnic amalgam that is Yunnan closer together."
yun.45.a:0 "Let's hope this was the right choice..."

yun.46.t:0 "Siniciziation Policies Restart"
yun.46.d:0 "While Yunnan's ethnic composition of more than 25 ethnicities has been troublesome for the previous administrations, the acquisition of Guizhou has made our Han population possess a slight number advantage. With this in mind, we should double down on the benefits Han Chinese get in order to promote immigration and colonization as to finally secure Yunnan as Chinese province once and for all."
yun.46.a:0 "Let's hope this was the right choice..."

yun.47.t:0 "Agricultural Reforms Begin"
yun.47.d:0 "Our first step in our plans to modernize the Yunnanese agriculture is to begin a province-wide land assessment. Our land measurement statistics date back from the days of the Xinhai revolution and renewing them would go a long way into helping us understand the current issues in our agricultural system as well as help us draft clear goals for our reforms."
yun.47.a:0 "Let's begin"

yun.48.t:0 "Land Assessment is Complete"
yun.48.d:0 "With the assessment of land complete, we have determined that there is plenty of room for improvement regarding the distribution and usage of arable land in our province. With this information, we have drafted a development scheme with the ultimate goal of promoting our provincial self-sufficiency, stately administer and store grain and increase the amount of overall arable land across the board."
yun.48.a:0 "Onwards!"

yun.49.t:0 "First Signs of Progress from our Agricultural Reforms"
yun.49.d:0 "With our investments into inventory managers and storage spaces for grain as well as improving the provincial irrigation system, we have finally started to see improvements into our overall food production. Although the plan is far from complete, the effects of our reforms are starting to benefit our farmers."
yun.49.a:0 "Great"

yun.50.t:0 "The Next Step of Our Reforms"
yun.50.d:0 "With our investments complete, we have managed to establish 10 water supervision areas controlled by provincial authorities loyal to us, as well as renovating 6 large-scale water reservoirs which have in turned increased the irrigation area for our farmlands in an estimated two hundred thousand square meters. However, while our reforms have clearly improved the overall production effectiveness, it hasn't improved the life of small land owners and peasants in our province. In order to do so, we shall start preparing a series of fiscal reforms in order to reduce the overall taxation of our farmers which shall hopefully improve the amount of the capital they can dispose of, and by extension, be able to afford better livelihoods by themselves."
yun.50.a:0 "It may be Less Taxes for Us, but it's more Money for our Farmers!"

yun.51.t:0 "Finalizing our Agricultural Reforms"
yun.51.d:0 "The tax cuts have been a success and they have increased the overall life conditions on our province and the previous reforms have brought our agriculture to the top of China. With Sichuan embroiled in the recent chaos, our analysts agree that Yunnan has become the main Chinese province in terms of production of food and staple foods. Today is a great day for our nation!"
yun.51.a:0 "All hail [Root.GetLeader] and his wisdom!"

yun.52.t:0 "Yunnan Threatens Us!"

yun.53.t:0 "The Master of the East Continent"
yun.53.d:0 "Thanks to Yunnan's valiant efforts during the War of National Protection, all of China was saved from a power-hungry tyrant. For our service, Yunnan was granted huge swaths of land in compensation, which made our relatively isolated clique a hegemon in China. However, the German intervention and several wars, skirmishes and border conflicts afterwards, Yunnan has been greatly weakened and reduced, and Tang Jiyao knows this. While he had proclaimed that he'd toe the line to keep the fragile peace we have kept with the Qing for nearly a decade, in secret meetings he has begun requesting his generals to start drawing plans. While today there's no chance of breaking the Zhili dominance, we can still prepare for when the time is right to take them down..."
yun.53.a:0 "One can never be too prepared!"

yun.54.t:0 "An Opportunity Presents itself"
yun.54.d:0 "With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, several new army cliques have banded together and formed new provincial entities. While we are friendly to some, like Guangxi and Guangdong, there are others that directly contest our sphere of influence, namely Hunan. Now that they are still reorganizing would be the perfect time to strike. However, our high command has opposed this idea, citing the recent economic downturn that Black Monday supposes for Yunnan as the reason why we should wait until we sort out or internal issues before attacking. Despite their protests, Tang has a reputation for opportunism and there has never been a clearer opportunity for expansion in the recent years..."
yun.54.a:0 "We Should Choose our Next Move Carefully Regardless..."

yun.55.t:0 "General Staff Refuses to take Action!"
yun.55.d:0 "With Tang's declaration for our armies to prepare to fight Hunan, the majority of the senior military staff of Yunnan has declared itself against such a course of action, and have ordered their troops to stand down and remain in their barracks. As tensions escalate, Tang's closest advisers have recommended him to exercise caution and to try to reach an agreement with the generals and drop the matter for the time being, even if that means allowing Hunan to slip away from our fingers. Tang, however, has not received the reports well, and has seemingly secluded himself in his home at Kunming for the time being, allegedly to reflect on the situation in order to come up with a solution."
yun.55.a:0 "Let's hope he knows what he is doing..."

yun.56.t:0 "Mobilizing the Troops"
yun.56.d:0 "With a campaign on Hunan still on the table, Tang has ordered the deployment of troops all around Yunnan to face off with the Hunanese troops. However, many bases have dismissed the order and have chosen to have their soldiers remain in their barracks. While this is a clear act of defiance to our government, a warlord without an army is a warlord that is only bound to be overthrown considering the chaotic nature of Chinese politics, so we need to find a way to convince them out of their barracks and to support Tang's efforts against the High Command."
yun.56.a:0 "Try to Bribe the Troops"
yun.56.b:0 "Force them out of the Barracks!"

yun.57.t:0 "The Opium Payment"
yun.57.d:0 "Provided Black Monday's mark on Yunnan's economy, when the disobeying officers made their demands clear that they wanted their wages paid at once after months of delay, we were almost unable to pay them. However, in a lucky turn of events, Tang managed to kill two birds with one stone: Huge stockpiles of Opium are mounting up on Yunnan's deposits, whereas our stockpiles of gold and silver are dwindling. In order to get rid of the Opium in a way that would contribute to the economy and satisfy our soldiers, Tang has provided around 3 million tons of Opium to the officers demanding for the payment of their wages. While we were sceptical this action might have convinced them, the troops are marching out of their bases and heading towards the front line."
yun.57.a:0 "Can't Believe that Worked!"

yun.58.t:0 "Communications Break Down!"
yun.58.d:0 "Our communications towards the other parts of the province have been cut off. With no way to ascertain the situation, Tang has sent out messengers to check in on the nearby cities, but we suspect betrayal from our army."
yun.58.a:0 "We must Prepare for the Worse"

yun.59.t:0 "General Meeting"
yun.59.d:0 "A delegation led by the General Long Yun arrived to Kunming yesterday, allegedly representing the several officer cliques within Yunnan who presented their complains via the Yi General. As requested, the meeting with Tang Jiyao is to take place today. The Generals have set their terms clear to Tang: None of them wishes abide for an attack against Hunan, as it is almost unanimously both politically and economically disadvantageous for the clique as a whole, and would endanger the 'Last Bastion of True Republicanism' to a crushing and humiliating defeat. While deliberations have been long, Tang has finally decided that..."

yun.61.t:0 "Campaign of Disrepute Against Tang Begins"
yun.61.d:0 "Scandal has been sparked today as hundreds if not thousands of fliers mocking Tang as an autocrat have been dispersed all over Kunming and other major cities of Yunnan. While we have been unable to track the specific source, it is believed that this is being done by other political factions opposing Tang Jiyao's rule. While disrepute campaigns aren't exactly a novelty in China, the sheer scale of it this time is concerning, and public unrest, which seems to be encouraged by our enemies, is mounting exponentially. We must act quickly if stability is to be maintained in the province."
yun.61.a:0 "It seems that Rats surround us"

yun.62.t:0 "The Guangdong Delegation"
yun.62.d:0 "With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces and the formation of new cliques near our immediate vicinity, the Yunnanese government has finally decided to organize an expedition to visit the Liangguang Clique. After a few days of travel, and silence from our delegation, they have finally reported that they have finally reached Nanning and have established contact with the Liangguang government. However, they are uncertain of the overall stance they should take towards them and have requested our input. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Guangdong and Guangxi bent the knee to the Qing and fell under the jurisdiction of the LEP, and while Tang and Chen never officially broke off relations, it was clear that holding them at such a time would've been disadvantageous for both. As years have passed since then, the delegation wonder whether we should still treat them as our friend and ally..."

yun.64.t:0 "Hunanese Delegation"
yun.64.d:0 "While the Yunnan Clique has long been a serious contender for hegemony in Southern China, there has always been one province it hasn't been able to secure: Guizhou. Despite valiantly defeating the Guizhou clique, the interference by the Zhili lapdogs in the League of Eight Provinces prevented us from fully seizing the clique for ourselves. As such, we still hold a formal claim to the region of Zhenyuan. However, since then, the League of Eight Provinces has collapsed, and the Hunan clique is now in possession of that land. So far, it doesn't seem like the Hunanese are hostile to us, in fact, they seem committed  to the cause of Chinese Republicanism. Nevertheless, they still find themselves in possession of land that is rightfully ours..."
yun.64.a:0 "We don't need it, their friendship is enough for us"
yun.64.b:0 "Re-state our commitment to unite Guizhou to Yunnan"

yun.65.t:0 "Left-Kuomintang Reapproachment?"
yun.65.d:0 "After the failure of the Northern Expedition, the remnants of the NRA Army ended up taking refuge in Yunnan. While this has been a great manpower and experience boost to our armed forces, it has been barely enough to deter the Zhili Clique from taking action against us despite our hostility towards them and the Monarchy. However, with the collapse of the LEP, it seems the veil of hegemony they had over China has finally been lifted, and we can finally once more dream of a free Chinese Republic. Conveniently for us, the Left-KMT has risen up against the League of Eight Provinces, and are quickly becoming a major thorn at the Zhili's side. As such, it may be in our best interest to keep amicable relations with them, although it may rub the surviving members of the Right-KMT in Yunnan the wrong way..."
yun.65.a:0 "Comrade Wang shall help us save China from Disgrace!"
yun.65.b:0 "Zhu Peide and Li Zongren are the real leaders of the KMT!"

yun.66.t:0 "The Fengtian Delegation"
yun.66.d:0 "In the years before the Zhili managed to consolidate their hold on China, Tang Jiyao and Zhang Zuolin shared their goal of a unified Republican China, with Tang even offering his help to Zhang during the Second Zhili-Fengtian War, managing to make gains into Hunan and Sichuan before the supply lines became over-extended, forcing the Yunnanese army to fall back to our current borders. While our defeat in the war may have been a major set-back, there's no reason why it should be a source of mistrust between our governments, and as such, a delegation to their government has been proposed to re-establish formal ties."
yun.66.a:0 "Send the Delegation"
yun.66.b:0 "We won't endorse Japanese Bootlickers"

yun.67.t:0 "Seeking support from the Left Kuomintang"
yun.67.d:0 "While far from the dominant Republican faction in Yunnan, the Left-KMT still finds a strong presence in the region informally with people like Liu Angong or Jin Handing forming part of our government. However, their ideological stance appears dangerous to many, as the idea of a revolution sweeping China as it swept through Russia, France and the United Kingdom still frightens many generals and public officials. As such, seeking their help to reinforce Tang's authority, while of valuable help, may yet prove-counter productive with the major Right-Kuomintang groups in Yunnan...."
yun.67.a:0 "It doesn't matter, let's have a toast for our socialist friends!"
yun.67.b:0 "We won't associate with such rabble-rousers"

yun.68.t:0 "Seeking support from the Right Kuomintang"
yun.68.d:0 "While it is clear that the group that would be most benefited from instability in Yunnan is the surviving remnants of the National Revolutionary Army, there's no denying that their influence stretches far and wide into our province. However, the loss of their leader a decade ago has certainly made an impression on their forces, as their leadership, split now between Zhu Peide and Li Zongren, has fallen victim to factionalist squabbles. Perhaps, instead of trying to antagonize our Republican friends, we should instead try to mend the rift that has been wedged between us over the years. While they may never accept Federalist ideas, we can still prove them that we are at the very least a necessary evil in order to rid China of foreign influence once and for all."
yun.68.a:0 "The National Revolutionary Army is made of patriots and everyone should know that!"

yun.69.d:0 "Our first option to ask for support in order to consolidate Tang's rule are the Federalists. Loyal to Tang Jiyao since his early days as governor of Yunnan, the Federalist supporters have organized a rally on Kunming to prove their support for the governor of the province."
yun.69.a:0 "Your support is greatly appreciated!"

yun.70.t:0 "Public Discontent Soars"
yun.70.d:0 "With our attempts at trying to rally support behind Tang having failed, now the unthinkable is happening. The local assemblies are all asking for Tang to resign, with public demonstrations occurring on almost every city, town and village around the province asking the army for Tang's removal. While none is yet bold enough to make a move against the Governor, it's only a matter of time before the enraged crowd encourages them..."

yun.71.t:0 "Purging the High Command"
yun.71.d:0 "Having reached an impasse with High Command, Tang Jiyao's patience has run out, and unwilling to postpone his invasion of Hunan, he has ordered his trusted officers to begin a purge of dissenting officers from Yunnan. In Kunming, officers who didn't take refuge in the Kunming Academy or fled outwards are being rounded up and imprisoned, with some inconclusive reports that executions may be taking place soon enough. However, the purge is reported to be fairly self-contained to Kunming, has most assemblies and officers have refused to imprison their comrades, and are now acting in defiance of Tang Jiyao's orders. As the situation continues to deteriorate, only time will tell whether Tang will be able to survive the chain of events he has just started..."
yun.71.a:0 "It's a necessary move"

yun.72.t:0 "Centralizing Power"
yun.72.d:0 "Having failed to rally any significant Republican support in the Yunnan assemblies, now any attempts that Tang makes of passing new laws or orders are constantly trumped. As such, he has staged a self-coup in the Kunming assembly, and declared the old Provincial Constitution he himself made as null and void. While this move, if successful, could centralize the province enough to grant him enough power to carry out any reforms he desires, it's also extremely illegitimate, and the assemblies of the other cities in Yunnan have already denounced his actions, as well as many other officers within the Yunnanese Army. Whether Tang will be able to weather the storm remains uncertain..."

yun.73.d:0 "With our attempts at rallying the Left Kuomintang unsuccessful, as their forces now lie broken, demoralized and scattered throughout China, we have also exposed ourselves to the ire of our own assemblies and officers. With civil discontent suddenly becoming high, and seeing a potential chance to seize power for himself, General Long Yun seems has arrived at Guizhou, and has started assembling loyalist forces in order to march on Kunming. While we have already dispatched an army in order to meet his forces head on, it remains uncertain whether our frail support base will actually remain loyal to us as the well known and respected General marches ever closer to our capital..."

yun.74.d:0 "Arriving from the East, Long Yun's initial move was to surround the city of Kunming, seemingly preparing for a siege. However, by the time of his arrival, the Kunming government and the leadership of the CPWDP had already evacuated the city through the Kunming-Haiphong railway, and an emissary from within the city walls delivered the surrender of the town to the Yi General. Without firing a shot, Long Yun managed to enter Kunming and re-proclaim himself as the Governor of Yunnan in front of the Cui Hu Park, and he has promised to bring back stability to the province, once and for all."

yun.80.t:0 "The Yunnanese Economy"
yun.80.d:0 "Yunnan is still one of the less Economically developed areas in China in terms of its overall economic power, due to its mountainous terrain and bad communication with the outside world. Yunnan depends mostly on its agriculture and mining to sustain itself, and it has overall grown especially reliant on opium production and other cash crops like tobacco or sugar in order to provide for its peasants. In Kunming, the establishment of the Kunming Arsenal and textile industries in the decades prior have also began establishing a small industrial base for what is essentially a far-away corner of China. This seemingly unrelated economic characteristics have now grown relevant again, as Black Monday's effects have greatly destabilized the province, economic experts like Miao Yuntai have brought up huge reform plans in order to push the province out of the crisis and forward into the future.\n\nMiao Yuntai, a longtime expert on Yunnan's economy and one of China's most renowned economists, has been one of the harshest critics of Tang Jiyao's economic policies over the years. Supporting an aggressive industrialization program and a complete overhaul of the agricultural production in the province, Miao has presented a reform plan for Yunnan which is split into two: The Agricultural and the Industrial reforms. While Yunnan has, in the long run, the capacity to complete both, he argues that undertaking both programs would both greatly reduce our economic capabilities as well as hindering the effectiveness of the reforms. As such, he advised that, whichever reform we choose to do first, we fully commit to its completion before moving on to the next."

His main argument is that, historically, Yunnan has been the second largest producer of Opium in the region, being greatly dwarfed by Sichuan which is the greatest Opium producer in all of China. As such, we had never been able to keep up with their production, and they took the majority of the market's demand. This has harmed our profits from the opium business, and as such it would be on our best interest to instead promote subsistence farming, and start government programs in order to help the Yunnanese addicts to move past their addiction. However, the final decision rests on [Root.GetLeader]..."

yun.83.d:0 "As our reliance on the opium trade remains, it seems that the lingering effects of it in the Yunnanese society at large is starting to permeate our General staff. One of our generals has been discovered consuming great amounts of opium, clouding his ability to exercise proper front line judgement. While normally this would be grounds for expulsion from the army, and maybe even execution, we live in exceptional times and a loss of an experienced battlefield commander is unacceptable, regardless of the grounds in which it happens. As such, it falls to [Root.GetLeader] to decide what should be done with the General..."

The delegates have thanked Zhu De for his assistance in securing the province, and request that he grants the seat of power over to the Kuomintang, and to Zhu Peide specificaly. While Zhu De stepped in to stop the growing civil war that was ensuing in the province, Zhu Peide invoked Zhu De's previous loyalty to the NRA and his assistance during the Northern Expedition as grounds for both men to find common political ground. However, considering the Kuomintang's defeat on the open battlefield by the National Foundation Army, this could be the perfect chance of cleaning the province from their influence..."

For years, Zhu De has been a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, a minor agrarian social democratic party which saw very little success in the province, until now. While stepping down in favour of its founder Zhang Bojun would be preferable by the assembly, perhaps the province needs a stronger hand to come out ahead of these dark times..."

As such, local newspapers quickly picked up on the search carried out by Zhu De to find his daughter in Sichuan, as his search progressed in the last few weeks. For those foreign to his search, an interview with Zhu De revealed some details of his search: Before leaving to Germany, Zhu De had married He Zhihua after meeting her in Shanghai, and in 1926, they both had a daughter, which he named Sixun. However, He Zhihua broke up with Zhu De shortly after returning from Germany, taking Sixun with her. While Zhu De had received a few hints of information on Zhihua's whereabouts over the years, he only learned relatively recently that Sixun was not with her, and so he decided to begin his search for her daughter. The failure of the Northern Expedition confined his search for young Sixun to Yunnan, but with the recent events in Sichuan, Zhu De has been able to extend his search in that area as well. Luckily for him, He Zhihua's sister had been tasked with taking care of young Sixun, now renamed Feifei by her mother, and she happened to live in Chengdu and read up on Zhu De's search posters. While the meeting took place privately and away from the press' eyes, the story has moved many amongst the Yunnanese public, who now support Zhu De's rule."

However, the General, dedicated to restore China to its natural state, decided that his presence was necessary, and injected himself right before the meeting with anti-anemic drugs he had acquired from German experts. While at first the meeting was carried out normally, it was clear the General was suffering sharp pain in his body, and was quickly taken to the Kunming Hospital. It was unfortunately too late, he was diagnosed of Blood poisoning due to the injection, and there was little the doctors could do for him other than sedating him to soothe the pain. He passed away this afternoon, and now the Kuomintang has been thrown into disarray. Despite the fact he was seen injecting himself with the drugs, many are saying that his death may have been a political assassination, and the fact vandals painted 'ZHU PEIDE - A MAN WITHOUT HONOUR' in his residence in Kunming only further increase the public's suspicions. As a provisionary measure, Bai Chongxi has been nominated provisional governor of the Yunnan Province, but it remains to be seen what his plans are, and if they aligned with Zhu Peide's vision at all..."

With the collapse of the Qing Empire however, the spheres of influence of Yunnan and Tibet amongst these autonomous groups of Tibetans have grown foggier, and the border delimiting what belongs to Tibet and what belongs to Yunnan have changed drastically over the years. However, within our territorial bounds, the departments of Diqin and Nujiang have always claimed the Southern Tip of Tibet, more specifically the town of Markam. While these relatively localised territorial 'misunderstandings' could be a good ground to start showing once again the Yunnanese dominance, many within our government worry if this is really a hill worth dying on..."

yun.150.d:0 "As part of the ongoing economic reforms in Yunnan, the subject of the Tin trade has been brought up repeatedly to Tang's attention. While there is no denying that the Tin trade is extremely profitable for the province, a lack of interest and constant instability in the province have made any progress into making that endeavour into an even more profitable one grind to a halt. However, since the recent downturn has allowed Miao Yuntai to reach a relevant political position, he has once again pointed to the book he authored back in the early twenties: 'Outline of the Gejiu Tin Industry'. In it, he detailed how to strengthen our gains from the mining industry, and how to reduce the hold of German economic interests over our precious tin. As a first step of his plan, he has requested to bring to Yunnan a Tin mining expert from Canada in order to assist in assessing the changes that will be required in order to make Yunnan's tin industry greater than ever."

The modern smelting machinery would, as he put it, remedy two key weaknesses of the Gejiu tin exports. The first one would be the Tin purity. The new electric furnaces, if properly operated, could raise the purity of the Gejiu tin to international standards and provide a uniformity of tin content that is necessary for direct international sales, which would allow us to bypass German economic consortiums that work as our liaison with the international market. Direct international tin sales would allow us to exclude the Guangzhou middlemen and the necessity of re-smelting, thereby concentrating the profits of the tin trade in the hands of the provincial government and our local tin producers. However, with our current lack of a foreign economic office to handle direct sales, we will be forced to utilize German intermediaries for the time being, although the new methods of Tin purification will greatly enhance our income."

While this change was predicted, the opening of the Fu-Dian Bank's offices in Hong Kong was not, and as a result, the Yunnan tin Company has seen fit to rescind their contracts from German companies. The contracts stipulated that, while the Yunnan Tin Company would have complete control of the mines in Yunnan, the selling of the tin would be handled via German intermediaries. While the control of the Kunming Haiphong Railway still allows us to cut a profit from their trade via tariffs, this is a severe blow to our mining companies' interests in the region."

Ever since, he has been a refugee back in his birthplace of Yunnan, often requesting our regional government for funding to maintain his cultural and religious projects.

Although nearly successful, the collapse of the British Empire and their hold over Egypt faltering saw Ma Jian unable to secure any passports to the now independent Kingdom of the Nile from the British consulate in Shanghai. Him and his students were left stranded in China, but years later he is now hoping to cash in his favour with our regional government to finally make the journey.

Today, we find an exception to this rule, as the renowned Hui scholar from China, more specifically the Yunnan province, has arrived today at Cairo with the blessing of his provincial government. With a small following of around a dozen students, they have toured the city's most important parts, and requested to remain in the city for a couple of months, where he wishes to learn arabic and began his transcription of the Qu'Ran into Chinese."

With a small following of around a dozen students, they have toured around the city and finished their tour visiting the Kaaba.

Apparently, as some dirt was being removed to construct the road, the workers uncovered the fossilized remains of an extinct animal. Geologist Bien Meinian was quickly contacted about the discovery, and he came rushing in to the area, where he quickly staged some analysis and, with the help of some workers, he uncovered the rest of the fossilized remains of the animal. Dubbed IVPP V15, the remains are now being transported to Kunming for further analysis. As palaeontological interest in area is now surging, Bien Meinian is now conducting some land surveys on the area to examine the possibility that we may have found a sedimentary rock formation that may potentially harbour even more examples. While his work did come for free, the transportation costs had to be covered by us, and while the road works have already resumed, the small delay still carries a monetary cost."

Young outside of China and the bright pupil of German Professor Friedrich von Huene, many intellectuals are now flocking to Yunnan to examine the remains of IVPP V15. While only a partial skeleton, many are comparing its sauropod-like appearance to the discovery of the Brachiosaurus Altitorax, a massive late Jurassic Sauropod discovered in 1903 in Colorado. However, early measurements from Bien Meinian show that the bones most likely come from the late Triassic, causing even further enthusiasm from scientist in the subject as the majority of the Sauropods are not believed to have evolved until the early stages of the Jurassic Era. Another issue that has brought interest to the fossils is the fact that the skeleton doesn't seem to belong to any of the known Sauropod species categorized in China, and many are excited to see if this new skeleton belongs to a yet undiscovered species of sauropods."

While the initial samples showed the area as an Upper Triassic Formation, further analysis has led Bien Meinian and other geologists to define it as a Lower Jurassic formation, clarifying that the bones of IVPP V15 could definitely belong to a Sauropod. On that end, Yang Zhongjian has also finally concluded that IVPP V15 belongs to a new species of dinosaur that hadn't been found before, and named it Lufengosaurus huenei, with the first name referring to the Formation, and the second name as a homage to his tutor, Friedrich von Huene. With this announcement, dozens of small archaeological teams from different parts of China and surrounding nations have been flocking into the province to begin exploration of the area. While this doesn't represent a massive change for our government, the scientific community of the province is sure to benefit from the influx of new geologists and palaeontologists."

While the Burmese had kept the situation under control by awarding keeping the province under shared leadership, now contesting sides of the Kokang government have approached us asking for recognition. With the death of the Myosa Yang Chun Yon in 1927, power in the area has been so far hotly contested between his son, Yang Wen Pi, and his brothers, Yang Chu jin and Yang Chun Pei. While Chu Jin and Chun Pei have shown signs of wanting to collaborate, Wen Pi has directly sent a letter to our government, stating that, so long as Yunnan protects the interest of Kokang from the 'Empire setting its sights on the Shan', he'd support our cause. With little choice between two squabbling brothers, we have sent out a small police detachment to support Wen Pi in his consolidation of power, and hopefully, this will grant us his loyalty once he becomes Saopha."

However, while his reputation in the area is enormous, his demands for his loyalty clearly show us his true colors. Apparently confident that his British ties will give him the upper hand in negotiations, he has demanded us to pay for the damages caused during our invasion, and to help further Hsipaw's welfare system.

Under their leadership, they have claimed a personal union with the Karenni State a bit to the south of Mongpai, and while this doesn't necessarily affect our administration, we are forced to put our own stance on the issue as the Prince could prove loyal to us, and a strong Karenni State perhaps would mean secession of this area in the future..."

###Flavour Events for Tang###
yun.316.t:0 "Rumours that Tang is a Monarchist Spread"
yun.316.d:0 "With the recent smear campaign against the government picking up steam, Tang has become the target of mockery by several parties who treat him as a Zhili bootlicker, and even worse yet, a monarchist. While Tang has refused to acknowledge these accusations, it's clear that some people are buying into the theories, and the longer this flurry of insults keeps on, it'll be impossible to secure Tang's legitimacy to the people."
yun.316.a:0 "Damn it!"

yun.317.t:0 "Director Maxu Weibang Contacts Tang for Another Movie"
yun.317.d:0 "While many outside of Yunnan are unaware, Tang Jiyao had starred in a movie as himself back in 1923. The movie itself is known as the 'Battle of Hongxian', and was the first movie produced in the Province. While ages have passed, Yunnan finds itself yet again on the spotlight of national protection, and the director of the 'Battle of Hongxian', Maxu Weibang, has contacted Tang once again with a proposal to do yet another movie. This time it'll focus on the Yunnanese efforts to seize Guizhou during the last Zhili-Fengtian war of the twenties, and while the name is yet to be drafted, it's a move that could solidify Tang's legitimacy. However, it may require some provincial funds...."
yun.317.a:0 "Of Course! Set the Studio Up for a Star!"
yun.317.b:0 "We can't afford this right now"

yun.318.t:0 "'The Battle of Guiyang' Releases!"
yun.318.d:0 "After a year and half of effort, Tang and Maxu Weibang's new movie, dubbed 'The Battle of Guiyang' has released. The movie, showing Tang as a front line commander taking the city from incompetent Zhili generals, while slightly inaccurate to the actual events, still has become a good piece of propaganda for our government, and while the movie is certainly not a massive hit in all of China, it's provincial screenings have made enough proceeds to justify its cost."
yun.318.a:0 "Hopefully It Captured Tang's Heroism..."

yun.319.t:0 "The Prostitute Scandal"
yun.319.d:0 "A local Kunming newspaper has started a wildfire with one of their morning reports: An unidentified neighbour to Tang's house in Kunming identified several girls being taken into the residence, seemingly against their will. While the human trade is strictly banned and penalized in Yunnan, it seems that Tang has been indulging in his desires through said trade. However, while it may be outrageous for many, we cannot allow this news to continue spreading, and as such the newspaper will be intervened and 'persuaded' to remove their news article and apologize for slander. We cannot risk our leader lose his position of power in these trying times..."

###Long Yun###

yun.320.t:0 "Socialists in Yunnan Organize a Strike in Kunming!"
yun.320.d:0 "While Socialists are seemingly an unknown force outside of Kunming, today they have staged a strike near the Cuihu Park to demand for better working conditions and wages in the Textile factories. While Long Yun has refused to issue public statements on the matter, it was clear from inside sources that he felt deeply insulted and is preparing a form of retaliation. As for what kind, it remains to be seen..."
yun.320.a:0 "What a Strange Occurrence..."

yun.321.t:0 "Foundation of the Blue Party"
yun.321.d:0 "The Blue Party, ironically named Qing despite being completely unrelated to the Qing Dynasty, was founded today in Yunnan by Jiang Zhongzheng, in no small part thanks to Long Yun funding his efforts. While the party seems more like a paramilitary than a proper party, considering the province only has local level elections, their leader has stated that they stand in harsh rejection of the recent strikes that took place in Kunming, and advice further rabble-rousers to stay at home or face justice from the Blue Party."
yun.321.a:0 "So This was Long Yun's plan...?"

yun.322.t:0 "The Blue Party Disperses a Strike"
yun.322.d:0 "Despite the threats issued by the Blue Party, yet another strike was organized in Kunming, in no small part thanks to the help of the Xindianshe and their leaders. This time, with some Tin miners that wanted higher pays in Gejiu as opposed to Textile workers. However, as the strikers attempted to march once more towards Cuihu Park, they were met by the Blue Party members, most of them ex-soldiers, staunch supporters of Long Yun or simply ardent anti-socialists, and a brawl quickly ensued. While the strike was dispersed, the Socialist influence reduced and there are no reported dead, there are many injured. However, Long Yun has responded positively to the news, and the fact the Blue Party's actions can't be traced back to him strangely make this an isolated incident in the eyes of the public despite him indirectly helping the Blue Party organize the brawl..."
yun.322.a:0 "His Bid Paid Off"

yun.323.t:0 "Long Yun and the Cinema Scene"
yun.323.d:0 "Long Yun's wife, Li Peilian, has long since been an influential figure in the Yunnanese cultural sphere. Coming from a Western Education, Li Peilian has taken a personal interest in renovating the Theatre and Cinema sections of Kunming, having funded other art exhibitions in the past. Now, with the help of Gu Yingqiu, otherwise known as 'Yunnan No.1 Beauty', and many other smaller investors and upper-classmen, Li Peilian is planning to open a top-of-the-line cinema for Kunming, which they have called the 'Nanping Cinema'. Long Yun in the past has helped other artistic works, like the establishment of the Yunnanese Opera in Kunming, for which he founded Lu Chongren to be funded by the Finance Department to setup the Drama Improvement Agency. Now that the construction of the Nanping Cinema is coming a bit short on funds, it falls to the Governor, and by extension, the government, to help with such vital infrastructure of our province."
yun.323.a:0 "All for the Sake of Art and Love"

yun.324.t:0 "Long Yun Launches a Theatre Play"
yun.324.d:0 "The Drama Improvement Agency has greatly helped introduce Opera to the Kunming Artistic scene. With artists coming to the province being impressed by the infrastructure put up by the governor, it should be no wonder that Kunming is quickly becoming one of China's most valued artistic destinations. With such a background, it has come as a rather pleasant surprise that Long Yun has submitted his own play for the Kunming Opera to perform. Called 'The Drama of Yunnan', it's meant to be a patriotic play to Yunnan's place in China as its vanguard in the frontier and as its role in national salvation during the National Protection War. While many critics have stated that the play has very clear anti-Zhili undertones, and that it seems to have little value outside of trying to inflate the morale of Yunnanese soldiers and citizens alike, there's no denying that many in the audience have walked out of the theatre having enjoyed the play."

yun.325.d:0 "Long Yun's son, Long Shengwen, has finally come of age and has decided to leave China in order to study International Relations Abroad. While his trip and inscription will mean a significant cost for the Long family, many in the province are moved by Yun's commitment to education, and the cabinet has authorized to give the Long family a small loan from the government to pay for Shengwen's education."

yun.327.t:0 "Long Shengwen Becomes a Millionaire!"
yun.327.d:0 "Amazingly, after graduating from his university, Long Shengwen started up his own business, and in a matter of a few years, he managed to get the money back to pay for his education, and he has repaid his Family the debt he incurred back when he left. It seems that Shengwen's experience is yet another proof of the strength and talent that lies in the Long lineage..."

###Zhu Peide###

yun.328.t:0 "Implementing the Kuomintang's Ideals to Yunnan"
yun.328.d:0 "With Yunnan's economy laying in ruins, and many scared or disheartened about the future of Yunnan and the future of China, it's no wonder that brother turned against brother in the recent uprising. Thankfully, the Kuomintang has come out on top of such struggle, and it is our duty to stand above these petty squabbles and to bring China to a brighter tomorrow. With such a thing in mind, our leader Zhu Peide has authorized our government to pass a series of sweeping reforms to our province, of the kind that the frontier has never seen in a long time. While the reform program is extensive, Zhu Peide has chosen to split it into three sections, same as the three main tenants of the Kuomintang: Minzu, Mínquán and Minsheng."
yun.328.a:0 "Glory to the Kuomintang!"

yun.329.t:0 "The First Principle: Minzu"
yun.329.d:0 "The first principle the Kuomintang has prioritized in Yunnan is that of Minzu, or Nationalism. With the dozens of ethnic groups in Yunnan, some of which have actively clashed in the past, it should be no surprise that Zhu Peide's first move is to try and unite these under a single banner. Zhu Peide himself, and many other government officials have begun touring the Frontier, visiting distant ethnic groups, spreading pamphlets and giving speeches about the new way of China, one where all of them will be represented, one in which all of them are as Chinese as the people in Beijing. While many remained apathetic to Zhu Peide's message, there's no denying that Kuomintang affiliations have risen among minorities..."
yun.329.a:0 "For a United China!"

yun.330.t:0 "The Second Principle: Mínquán"
yun.330.d:0 "The second principle Zhu Peide has introduced to Yunnan is one that existed before us took over, luckily. Usually translated as 'Democracy' or 'Government by the People', in this stage of reforms, the Kuomintang has introduced their binary set of 'Powers' to Yunnan: The Zhèngquán (Power of Politics) and the Zhìquán (Power of Governance).\n\n On one hand, Zhèngquán, commonly understood as the power of the people to express their political wishes, is now represented by the new National Assembly formed in Kunming, with the power to call for local and provincial elections, to take initiative in local projects and to allow the people to voice their wishes via referendum. While these would mean the people could normally vote out Zhu Peide from power, our leader has invoked the concept of the 'Political Tutelage', in that he'll remain as leader of the Kuomintang in Yunnan until China is finally united.\n\n On the other hand, Zhìquán represents the republican balance of powers many European and American nations uphold. However, unlike most nations which have a Congress (Executive Branch), a Senate(Legislative Branch) and a Supreme Court(Judicial Branch), the Kuomintang has now implemented Five branches for the province: The Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan and the Examination Yuan, the first tree from European inspiration and the final two from Chinese tradition. With this sweeping change in structure, the old system Tang had created for the province is now fully gone."
yun.330.a:0 "For the People of China!"

yun.331.t:0 "The Third Principle: Minsheng"
yun.331.d:0 "The third and final section of the reforms is the principle of Minsheng. Commonly translated as 'The People's Welfare', in Yunnan it means the government has introduced a land value tax, and with the proceeds that come from it, social programs are already been drawn and passed in order to help peasants and workers improve their quality of life by subsidizing food consumption, clothing and housing costs. While many major landlords have protested in front of the Kunming assembly, the reality is that this move has made Zhu Peide immensely popular amongst the peasantry."
yun.331.a:0 "For a Fairer China!"

yun.332.t:0 "Honouring the Kuomintang Past"
yun.332.d:0 "With the reforms passed, the Kuomintang comfortably stands strong in Yunnan's government. However, the troubled history of the party still haunts it. With many old soldiers from the time of the Northern Expedition retiring, the memory of the heroes of the past seems to be fading as Zhu Peide becomes the new Generalissimo of the party. Such a thing is a unacceptable, and plans for monuments for both Chiang Kai-Chek and Sun Yat-Sen have been drawn. However, while everyone agrees Dr. Sun deserves his monument in the province, many within the party have mixed feelings about giving one to Chiang. While he arguably built the National Revolutionary Army and led our forces in the Northern Expedition, it was his decisions that eventually led to its failure and the near annihilation of the party and of Republicanism in China. As the debacle escalates, Zhu Peide has been forced to step in and enforce his decision..."

##Tusi Revolt##

yun.333.t:0 "Gong Shou Attacks Han Frontier Settlements"
yun.333.d:0 "Given our recent disenfranchisement of Tusi leaders, some in the Western section of Yunnan have chosen to join efforts with the radical anti-Han Tusi leader Gong Shou, and have grown bold enough to attack a Han Settlement in the Frontier, killing or severely injuring most residents before our regional garrison could catch the culprits. While they remain on the run, we may need to allocate extra protection in the frontier and a hunting party to catch them, as well as compensating the residents for failing to protect them. What should we do?"
yun.333.a:0 "We Shall Hunt Them Down the Last Man!"
yun.333.b:0 "We'll Catch Them Eventually"

yun.334.t:0 "Gong Shou Has Been Caught!"
yun.334.d:0 "After months of pursuit in the treacherous frontier, our forces have finally apprehended Gong Shou. As he's been transported to Kunming to being tried, the citizens of the frontier breathe a sigh of relief at the news. It seems the wild frontier is one step closer to stability."

yun.335.t:0 "Chen Ruzhen's Assassination"
yun.335.d:0 "The Cangyuan Administration, which has been tasked with keeping the peace in the Cangyuan County in the Prefecture of Licang, has suffered a major loss today. The Police Chief Chen Ruzhen, one of the major executive members of the administration, was shot dead in his office. While the investigation is still ongoing, other officers have pointed to the Christians of Cangyuan as the culprits of the assassination. Many in the area claim that Chen was involved in crackdowns against Christians in the area, in a bid to 'purge European influence', and it seems his luck had finally caught up with him. While we've yet to issue any formal orders regarding the case, as the investigation is still ongoing, it's clear that many members of the Cangyuan Administration want retaliation against christian groups."
yun.335.a:0 "Christians Being Relevant? In China?"

yun.336.t:0 "Retaliation in Cangyuan Fails"
yun.336.d:0 "While the investigation of Chen Ruzhen's murder is still ongoing, 300 men, between policemen and local militias, were sent to Cangyuan to retaliate against the christians without our consent. In the first instance, a street brawl ensued and they were forced to retreat back to Lancang. With the town seemingly on open revolt, 100 of the 300 men were sent back to pacify the county. After a few days and a few requests of explainations, we've received a full report from the Cangyuan Administration of that last expedition: One of the men fired a weapon towards the civilian crowd (even though it is unknown if it was provoked), and apparently killed one of the residents, sparking yet another street brawl, where most soldiers were able to escape unharmed, but they were still kicked back to Cangyuan. It seems that the Christians there are becoming more than a small nuisance, we will have to give the Licang more assets to deal with this apparent insurrection."
yun.336.a:0 "How the..."

yun.337.t:0 "Retaliation Strike in Cangyuan Succeeds"
yun.337.d:0 "With express orders from our government to restore order in the town, the Cangyuan Administration assembled a small militia of 2000 men and sent them to finally pacify the area, although we gave specific instructions to prevent yet another bloodshed like last time. After four months of efforts, the militia has been recalled and the reports are overall positive. While in the end there were eleven civilian casualties and twenty three wounded, the town is finally firmly under our control once more, although some within the Cabinet and the Kunming Assembly have proposed to investigate the Cangyuan Administration for ilegal Religious persecution, which may be the way to prevent this revolts in the near future."

However, the defenders were well positioned, and a few well placed machine guns on the bridges were able to hold off our advance for hours, inflicting multiple casualties to our forces. In the end, our forces were required to fall back, and the West remains in rebel hands."
yun.350.a:0 "Damn"

yun.351.t:0 "The Surrender at Chuxiong"
yun.351.d:0 "After the artillery was put in place near the city, the surrender ultimatum was issued, and foolishly ignored by the rebels. The artillery pieces then began concentrated fire near the mouth of the bridges that gave access to the city, in preparation for an infantry assault. With the defenders at the bridge swept by the Artillery barrage, our infantry was able to make quick work of the defenders and capture the city, securing our western flank and allowing us to look Eastwards."
yun.351.a:0 "Excellent"

yun.352.t:0 "The Battle of Qujing"
yun.352.d:0 "With orders to hold the entrances to the valley, our soldiers positioned themselves both at the lower ends of the valley and the hills surrounding it. As the rebel forces came close, the narrow nature of the entrances and the usage of the high ground by our own forces was able to  hold the entrances to the city against a seemingly more numerous foe."
yun.352.a:0 "Good job"

yun.353.t:0 "The Battle of Qujing"
yun.353.d:0 "With our forces falling back into the city, the enemy took hold of the valley entrances and positioned several divisions on the hillsides. While the battle is still raging in the city, it's clear that with their forces in the hills we will be unable to push them out without suffering heavy casualties, and our officers are advising us to retreat from the valley and focus our forces elsewhere."
yun.353.a:0 "What a blunder..."

yun.354.t:0 "The Capture of Anshun"
yun.354.d:0 "After waiting for a day, Long Yun's forces moved into Anshun, and found that the defenders had kept their promise. The elderly, children and women had been evacuated, and their force had retreated, allowing us to take the city without any fighting. However, locals who decided to stay have stated that the force that retreated was several times larger than the new occupiers, so maybe not engaging was actually the wisest choice..."
yun.354.a:0 "What a Weird Turn of Events..."

yun.355.t:0 "The Capture of Anshun"
yun.355.d:0 "With our soldiers trying to assault the city right away, it became clear that the defenders were a lot better prepared than our forces were to held the city. After repelling our attacks repeatedly, our officers had no choice but to retreat. It seems the evacuation forces were a lot more numerous than our offensive force was..."
yun.355.a:0 "That's Unfortunate"

yun.356.t:0 "The Battle of Bijie"
yun.356.d:0 "With a part of our forces diverted to attack from an unexpected flank in the north of Bijie, the defender force became distracted by our diversionary frontal assault. As the frontal assault unfolded, our other force flanked the defenders and turned the one-sided defense into an encirclement, quickly throwing the enemy forces off-balance and allowing us to take the strategically important town of Bijie."
yun.356.a:0 "Great Job"

yun.357.t:0 "The Battle of Bijie"
yun.357.d:0 "While we tried focusing our efforts into punching through the main defender line, a lack of artillery and well dug and devised defenses in the valley entrance made us unable to secure any footing into the town. Having suffered heavy casualties, are assault has been called off and we'll have to rethink our strategy if we wish to take back Bijie from the Rebels for good."
yun.357.a:0 "What a disaster"

yun.358.t:0 "The Defence of Bijie"
yun.358.d:0 "With our forces scattered in the night attack and the order to fall back to the roads being issued, the bulk of the enemy force managed to take the city, and without any solid grounding to defend our position, we have been forced to retreat from Bijie as a whole to a defensive position closer to Kunming, which may prove to be a shaky defence line later on..."
yun.358.a:0 "That's not good..."

yun.359.t:0 "The Defence of Bijie"
yun.359.d:0 "Despite the starting confusion for the night raid, our order to dig in and hold managed to reach our officers, which quickly began organizing our forces to defend the Bijie from the rebel forces. After hours of furious urban combat, the enemy force finally chose to retreat, and we remain yet in control of the city, which we can now use as a staging ground for our invasion of Western Guizhou."
yun.359.a:0 "Excellent"

yun.360.t:0 "The Storming of Guiyang"
yun.360.d:0 "The order to secure Guiyang first came at a high cost. The defenders in Qingzheng, well prepared and dug in to fend off our force from the South-West easily repelled their attack, and while our forces managed to fully seize Guiyang, the defenders and Qianzhong have started pushing into the city, and without the backing of the Southern Force, we'll be forced to cede some ground before we can deliver a final blow to the rebels."
yun.360.a:0 "We Should've Moved Faster..."

yun.361.t:0 "The Storming of Guiyang"
yun.361.d:0 "With orders to march straight into Qinzheng from Guiyang, we were able to pincer the defenders there and encircle the enemy forces. With no room to escape, they quickly surrendered and the Western area of Guizhou seems to be under total control of our regime"

yun.363.t:0 "The Battle of Jinghong"

yun.365.t:0 "Battles in Guiyang and Zhaotong"
yun.365.d:0 "With the bulk of our supplies having gone to Zhaotong, we were able to hold our position in the northernmost area of the Kunming region. However, the loss of Guiyang has greatly strengthened the rebel forces in the East, and even though we achieved victory in Zhaotong, it's not a victory that will guarantee a swift end to this rebellion."

yun.366.t:0 "The Defence of Chuxiong"
yun.366.d:0 "Having prepared for a protracted and elastic defense, our troops first engaged the enemy forces near Guanyin Mountain, being forced to retreat to the banks of the Longchuan River and into Chuxiong proper. As the enemy casualties mounted, it was clear that they couldn't penetrate our defense and that they had lost their momentum, and they began retreating. Quick to seize the opportunity, our officers took the initiative and began chasing them back into Dali, and we expect them to secure the area anytime soon."
yun.366.a:0 "Excellent."

yun.367.t:0 "The Defence of Chuxiong"
yun.367.d:0 "Having prepared for a static defense, our troops engaged the full bulk of the enemy forces to the side of the Longchuan river. While we were able to hold the line thanks to some well placed machine guns in the bridge crossings, enemy artillery support, while scarce, eventually pulverized our positions, and as the enemy with superior numbers began pouring into Chuxiong, our officers had no choice but to order a full retreat towards the valley at the Northeast and protect Kunming directly from a seemingly impending attack from the enemy that now occupies Chuxiong."
yun.367.a:0 "Damn."

yun.368.t:0 "The Battle of Jinghong"
yun.368.d:0 "Having Split our forces, we were able to pincer the enemy and secure Jinghong for our forces. While we found little proof that they were being supplied through the Lancang River, we now know for sure that they won't be getting ressuplied anytime soon!"

yun.369.t:0 "The Battle of Jinghong"
yun.369.d:0 "With our force trying to push into a narrow valley, the enemy force quickly staged a defense against our forces, and even though we had the element of surprise, we were unable to break their defense. While our officers have not decided to pull out from the area just yet, it's clear that they lack the strength to deal a decisive blow to the defenders, and as enemy forces reorganize elsewhere, this defeat could cost us dearly."
yun.369.a:0 "Damnit"

yun.370.t:0 "The Battle of the Luojiang River"
yun.370.d:0 "Having chosen to push them Eastwards, our forces managed to rout the enemy from their defensive positions. However, and to our great detriment, they were properly reinforced from Bijie in their retreat, and instead of facing two small, separate forces, we are now facing one single, large enemy contingent in a narrow valley. Our advance has been completely halted, and this may prove to be a decisive mistake if the enemy manages to reorganize in Guiyang."

yun.371.t:0 "The Battle of the Luojiang River"
yun.371.d:0 "Having chosen to push the enemy into the north, our forces were quickly able to rout the enemy from their defensive positions and push them into the Sichuan border. Stuck between the Sichuanese Border and our forces, the enemy commander decided to surrender to our forces, and now our army marches victoriously eastwards, albeit facing some enemy opposition. It seems that the campaign is running smoothly, for now..."

However, as the battle dragged on, the geography surrounding Yuxi played against our forces, as an enemy detachment flanked eastwards heading first to lake Fuxian and then turning Westwards to encircle Yuxi. In the panic, our officers ordered to break out, and while the breakout attempt was successful and the bulk of our force was able to retreat, we still loss Yuxi, and our chances of attacking the West now are looking dimmer by the day as an enemy army marches near Kunming."

As our scheduled all-out assault began, our detachment closed in from the north with almost perfect timing. The flanking caught the defenders almost completely off-guard, and while their entrenched positions were hard to clear out and a savage close-quarters Combat ensued in the narrow streets of Xingyi, we were quickly able to rout the enemy, push south to meet the Southern Force."

yun.401.d:0 "With the adoption of Federalist laws and constitution, the executive power in Yunnan has always been severely decentralized, and while Tang has done whatever was necessary to still keep the reins in such a system, it is clear that it was not enough to allow him to remain in control. With rallies and protests being a daily occurrance, Tang has decided that the time has come to abolish the Provincial Constitution and restore order to the province. While some see this move as necessary, many concerned republicans fear this is just one step more dangerously closer to an autocracy..."
yun.401.a:0 "Is Tang finally betraying the Federalists?"

yun.402.t:0 "Local Government Powers Reform"
yun.402.d:0 "As the grip of the Zhili Clique grows weaker on China, Tang has decided that, in order to further consolidate his grip on the province, a revision to the local government assemblies has to be made. While the local provinces elect their own candidates for the assemblies, this has created a weird mix of somewhat conflicting governments, which have drifted away from Tang's Federalism and more into the traditional Republican lines of the KMT and even warlord-supportive assemblies like in Baoshan. As such, passing coherent reforms from one extreme to the other of the province has become extremelly difficult, and instead of continuing to use this system, Tang has opted for replacing the heads of these assemblies with his own trusted candidates. While this move is quite obviously undemocratic, he argues that it is a temporary move as the transition to a Federalist system begins. In order to further prove his commitment to the Federalist Ideas, he has simultaneously passed a decree in which the Head of each local assembly now has the ability to handle the redistribution of land from feudal landholders to the peasants, as well as encouraging the free trade between the different assemblies instead of having Kunming regulate their internal affairs. Though some detractors from the Kuomintang have openly criticized the move for deposing their comrades, the public results of the reform have made Tang publicly more popular, and that should force them to remain largely silent, even if the move directly hinders their power in the province."
yun.402.a:0 "A new step towards Federalism? or another step towards Authoritarianism?"

yun.403.t:0 "Provincial Constitution Expansion"
yun.403.d:0 "Based off Chen Jiongming's 'Reconstruction Plan' (Jianshe Fanglue), Tang had passed a constitution for approval years ago in which it detailed a system of shared authority between the Central and local governments. Since China as a whole is still far from being united under a Central government, this meant that Kunming and each local assembly would follow a decentralized ethos, encouraging the use of trade and professional organizations as the primary organizational units in cities, while villages and counties would retain their traditional subdivisions, among many other principles. However, back in the first implementation, Tang sidelined plenty of the points Chen made, like reducing the Executive Power of the President to a mere figurehead, where the executive power would be held by the assembly in charge, where Tang held to a near absolute power as governor of Yunnan, and he also refused to implement the creation of legislative bodies that were, on all levels, handled and organized via popular and direct voting of the people. However, with his new-found stability, Tang has decided that implementing the latter part to the provincial constitution will greatly enhance his footing publicly, as people will now be able to vote for judges and court officials, and will allow Tang to close ranks even further with his fellow Federalist supporters."
yun.403.a:0 "Wait, but what happened to the Executive Power of the Head of State?"

yun.404.t:0 "The Future of the Yunnan Clique"
yun.404.d:0 "With the final struggle in China growing ever closer, Tang finally has the chance of deciding once and for all what the fate of the mountain province will be on the grand scheme of China. While Tang has supported the Federalists in their past struggles, being a member of the Public Interest Party himself and having endorsed many of their policies, it's clear that he is not entirely willing to share the spotlight with Chen Jiongming, and a power struggle between the two men will become inevitable. On the public side, there are mixed feelings on joining the Federalists. While the province is undoubtedly Republican and opposed to the Qing and Zhili Dominance in any way, shape or form, it is also true that a huge sector of the population is unwilling to carry on battling for the rest of China. After all, most of Yunnan is inhabited by small minority groups, with not much interested in the far-away Han-centric politics that permeate Beijing and those racing towards it. As such, the choice between stepping in with the Federalists and remaining popular with the populace may not be as simple as Tang had originally thought..."

Governor Tang Jiyao has been confirmed dead and large scale uprisings are being reported throughout the once-hegemonic province of Southern China. Many experts suspect that behind these uprising lie both the surviving Right-Kuomintang forces, the National Revolutionary Army, led by Zhu Peide and the Warlord forces following General Hu Ruoyu, a long time rival of Long Yun.

YUN_enact_conscription_desc:0 "Yunnan has for a long time had a merely volunteer force. The reason for that is that the Army was mostly composed of exiles from the East and North, who came to Yunnan after the failure of the Northern Expedition. However, between retirements and casualties, our manpower pool has reduced significantly over time, so perhaps it's time to, once again, implement Conscription."
YUN_centralize_the_general_staff:0 "Centralize the Command Chain"
YUN_centralize_the_general_staff_desc:0 "Dozens of separated cliques of officers operate in Yunnan, with battalion-sized army groups almost entirely under their direct control.

YUN_Prioritize_our_equipment_desc:0 "While manpower and leadership are vital aspects of modern warfare, we live in an industrial age. Wars are no longer winnable just with rusty swords and bravery, but with raw firepower and cold and calculative allocation of resources. Since Yunnan lacks the means to keep up in this aspect, we should look into improving our production capabilities."
YUN_Purchase_Artillery:0 "Purchase Artillery"
YUN_Purchase_Artillery_desc:0 "Artillery became a deal breaker for most nations during the Great War, and its recent usage both inside and outside of China have greatly proven that indirect artillery fire rules the modern battlefield. In order to prepare Yunnan for this kind of warfare, we should invest into importing Artillery pieces into the region."

YUN_overhaul_the_Kunming_arsenal_desc:0 "The Kunming Arsenal has provided our Army with top quality rifles for years now, and it has had a pivotal role in our victories in the past. Without it, our army would amount to a disorganized peasant militia armed with pitchforks. As such, an overhaul in order to improve working conditions and improve production capabilities is in order, so that Kunming may produce the best rifles in all of China."
YUN_artillery_assemblies:0 "Artillery Assemblies"
YUN_artillery_assemblies_desc:0 "While the Kunming Arsenal does a superb job in producing Rifles, the recent importance and influx of Artillery from the outside has proven that we need to extend its production to new horizons.

YUN_focus_on_support_equipment:0 "Support Equipment Production"
YUN_focus_on_support_equipment_desc:0 "It's not only guns and artillery pieces that we will need to win the battles to come. We will also need shovels, tents and other kinds of auxiliary equipment for our engineers and scouts to use. In order to become more self-sufficient, instead of importing these from Germany as we have so far, we should instead foster the production of this material locally."
YUN_Prioritize_our_manpower:0 "Prioritize our Manpower"
YUN_Prioritize_our_manpower_desc:0 "While Weapon production and Tactics will be invaluable in the field of battle, we cannot fight a war without men.

We shall import a shipment of the newest Artillery pieces the Germans have to offer and reverse Engineer it in order to learn its secrets."
YUN_engineer_corps:0 "Engineer Corps"
YUN_engineer_corps_desc:0 "Yunnan is a province of contrasts. Large mountains paired with deep valleys and huge river crossings make any combat within our province a challenge of ingenuity.

YUN_enact_multi_ethnic_conscritpion:0 "Enact Multi-Ethnic Conscription"
YUN_enact_multi_ethnic_conscritpion_desc:0 "Currently, only Chinese Ethnicities can serve in the Yunnanese Armed forces, which means that our army is mostly made up of Han, Hui and the Yi. However, our province is made up of a lot of ethnic groups besides those, and extending the conscription to these ethical groups would increase our manpower pool significantly, even if it will have a political cost..."
YUN_improve_coordination:0 "Improve Coordination"
YUN_improve_coordination_desc:0 "One of the major flaws in our armed forces is how localized each regiment and battalion is. Due to the distances involved, and the lack of communications infrastructure, half of our army has to operate on its own terms, and this causes cohesion to break down in the face of battle. If we are to field a larger army, we will need to solve this issues in cooperation in order to stand a chance in the battlefield."
YUN_enact_meritocratic_promotions:0 "Non-discriminatory Promotions"
YUN_enact_meritocratic_promotions_desc:0 "Perhaps not surprisingly, the Yunnanese Army, and the Chinese army in general, have always preferred to promote Han Generals to leadership positions, with only a few exceptions to this rule like General Long Yun or Bai Chongxi. To combat this, we should legislate that promoting officers should only be done based on skill, regardless of ethnicity."
YUN_elite_officer_corps:0 "Elite Officer Corps"
YUN_elite_officer_corps_desc:0 "Yunnan is the home of one of the most advanced Officer Corps in China, thanks to the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army and the survivors of the New Guangxi Clique as well as our own cadre of Generals.

YUN_adopt_special_tactics:0 "Adopt Special Tactics"
YUN_adopt_special_tactics_desc:0 "China has a long tradition of utilizing straightforward attack plans, more reminiscent of Weltkrieg style infantry charges than organized and well thought-out attacks. Instead of throwing our manpower to the fire, we should instead learn the lessons of German Shock Troopers in order to maximize the combat effectiveness of our units and minimize our casualties."
YUN_infiltration_excercises:0 "Infiltration Exercises"
YUN_infiltration_excercises_desc:0 "Considering China's large armies, perhaps an indirect approach to battles will be best in order to gain the upper hand.

YUN_Kunming_Academy_support:0 "Expanding the Kunming Academy"
YUN_Kunming_Academy_support_desc:0 "The Kunming Academy has produced some of China's finest officers, and now we need its services more than ever.

YUN_accept_only_the_best:0 "Improve Officer Standards"
YUN_accept_only_the_best_desc:0 "A lot of officers in Yunnan wound up being promoted hastily and without proper checks of their skill and talents. Instead of encouraging a purge of our officers, which would be undesirable and politically negative, we shall encourage the usage of higher officer promotion standards, so that officers that truly earned their positions remain and climb up the hierarchical ladder."
YUN_renew_academy_textbooks:0 "Renew Academic Textbooks"
YUN_renew_academy_textbooks_desc:0 "While the Kunming Academy has done a great job at producing officers, it has done so with pre-Weltkrieg manuals, which in many ways are severely outdated to the face of the modern battlefield, as the French learned the hard way in 1914. In order to keep our edge, we will need to start importing some new bibliography in order to train our troops and officers in the newest battlefield techniques."
YUN_Army_excercises:0 "Army Exercises"
YUN_Army_excercises_desc:0 "Practice makes perfect, and as such, our army must not fall behind in this aspect. As we organize new war games, we will be able to test new strategies and tactics to separate the wheat from the chaff."

YUN_CaiE_art_of_war_desc:0 "Cai E is immensely respected in Yunnan for his tactical and strategic expertise, as well as his bravery in leading the National Protection Alliance. As his impact cannot be ignored, his preference for preserving manpower and maintaining well equipped divisions in the front line have made an impact in the ideas of our current officer corps, and we should tailor our province to follow his ideals."
YUN_Chinas_finest:0 "Finalize our Reforms"
YUN_Chinas_finest_desc:0 "With our reforms at an end, time has come to finally take all the knowledge we have gathered and put it to practice.

YUN_fierce_assault:0 "Fierce Assault Preparations"
YUN_fierce_assault_desc:0 "Once the battle starts, we cannot slow our advance down or we will lose our momentum.

YUN_improve_hospitals:0 "Improve Field Hospitals"
YUN_improve_hospitals_desc:0 "A way to reduce Yunnan's manpower shortage will be to have front line hospitals capable of treating and properly caring for our men so that they may be back on the battlefield faster.

YUN_improve_logistical_support:0 "Improve Logistical Support"
YUN_improve_logistical_support_desc:0 "In order to sustain a large standing army, we will need to adjust our supply lines accordingly. During the Zhili-Fengtian war, we had an unfortunate taste of logistical shortcomings as Tang's overstretched forces failed to help Fengtian's forces break through the Zhili lines.

YUN_National_Southwestern_Associated_University_desc:0 "Thanks to the chaos in central and eastern China, the exiled intellectuals have brought us a lot of room to organize new research teams to help the R&D department of the Kunming Arsenal. As such, the formation of the new National Southwestern Associated University, that represents faculties from different prestigious universities, would allow us to better coordinate these efforts."
YUN_seeking_new_markets:0 "Seek New Markets"
YUN_seeking_new_markets_desc:0 "With our own supply of goods secured, we should seek to sell our excess production abroad. While the dependence on exports in the past has damaged our own self-sufficiency, we are confident that resuming the practice exclusively on excess goods is bound to only bring benefits to our economy."
YUN_expand_infra:0 "Expand Rural Infrastructure"
YUN_expand_infra_desc:0 "Ever since the first human settlements appeared at the sides of the Dian Lake thousands of years ago, connecting the bountiful farmland with the villages and cities through the maze of mountains and valleys of Yunnan has been a tough challenge for every government in the region. We should try our best to expand on it, and to improve upon the already existing framework."
##Alternate Tree
YUN_initial_stabilization:0 "Initial Stabilization"
YUN_initial_stabilization_desc:0 "With Tang's final blunder, a massive rebellion has sprung out across Yunnan. The Federalists, the Kuomintang and the Warlords all began clashing against one another in a struggle for dominance. Only now, after weeks of struggle, the wounds are starting to heal..."
YUN_End_the_Monarchy:0 "End the Monarchy"
YUN_End_the_Monarchy_desc:0 "The Qing Empire has been a thorn in our side for decades, and it has vastly outlived its usefulness. As such it falls to us, the people who once overthrew the pretender Yuan Shikai during the National Protection War to save China from disgrace."
YUN_Secure_Tibet2:0 "The Tibetan Debacle"
YUN_Secure_Tibet2_desc:0 "While the Yunnanese government may look outwards towards conquest, there are still small disputes we need to resolve. In the chaos that followed the independence of Tibet, they happened to seize land that was ours. However, many wonder if we should truly focus on such a small claim in these trying times..."
YUN_Exploit_Burma2:0 "The 'Yellow Book' Affair"
YUN_Exploit_Burma2_desc:0 "The Pianma Incident of 1910 saw the British and their Burmese stooges seize control of what was and is rightful Chinese territory. However, we have been in negotiations for months with the tribal leaders of the border region, and they have proclaimed their support for us. The time has come for putting our cards on the table and release the 'Yellow Book'..."
YUN_Strike_At_Liangguang:0 "Strike at Liangguang"
YUN_Strike_At_Liangguang_desc:0 "Liangguang has always been a thorn in our side for these last few decades, first by sending us the decadent remains of the New Guanxi Clique and later by joining the League of Eight Provinces. Their time as a thorn in our side is now at an end, as we shall strike them down before they can suppose a threat to our province."
YUN_the_Siamese_Threat2:0 "Our Claims in Siam"
YUN_the_Siamese_Threat2_desc:0 "The fall of the British Empire saw Burma reaffirming their independence, but with this came weakness. Without the support of the British and the Entente, Siam was able to lay claim to a portion of the Pianma region, of which is true Chinese territory. With the successful acceptance of the Yellow Cover Affair, now it's time to secure the Silver mines that were stolen by the Siamese!"
YUN_Conquer_Indochina:0 "Conquer Indochina"
YUN_Conquer_Indochina_desc:0 "Indochina has been a thorn in our side since antiquity. Now, they stand in possession of the valuable Kunming-Haiphong Railway, and once more, we have the choice to go to war for the Region to strengthen China..."
YUN_Long:0 "Long Yun's Clique"
YUN_Long_desc:0 "Long Yun, a local Yi General and a widely popular officer among the Yunnanese soldiers and minority groups, has come ahead in the power struggle following Tang's overthrow. As for what future awaits for Yunnan, only Long Yun knows..."
YUN_the_Society_of_Bamboo_King:0 "The Society of the Bamboo King"
YUN_the_Society_of_Bamboo_King_desc:0 "The Society of the Bamboo King is a secretive organization, mostly made up of Tusi leaders, politicians and other groups seemingly disadvantaged by the Han encroachment into Yunnan. While most of their objectives are shrouded in mystery, what we do know is that they wish to curb the influence of the Han in Yunnan, and collaborating with them for the sake of unity in Yunnan is in our best interests."
YUN_Dian_Identity:0 "Dian Identity"
YUN_Dian_Identity_desc:0 "For Centuries, Yunnan has been a melting pot of cultures. Divided, the province has been preyed upon by Beijing and foreigners alike, and as such, we should strive to form a new identity, which integrates the multicultural aspect of our province into a harmonious mosaic of ethnicities, united in their desire for self-preservation and the prosperity of the province."
YUN_Sinitic_Dominance:0 "Sinitic Dominance"
YUN_Sinitic_Dominance_desc:0 "Despite all setbacks, the Han have become the ethnic majority in Yunnan, and as minority groups insist on having separate rights than the rest of China, we have to continue encouraging Han immigration so that Yunnan may continue to be a part of China lest it actually develops separatist sentiments."
YUN_Restore_political_stability:0 "Restore Political Stability"
YUN_Restore_political_stability_desc:0 "With Han immigration having restarted, several ethnic groups have shown their dissapproval of our policies, and are now protesting our apparent reforms. While we sympathize with their demands, we can't afford dissent now, and we will have to supress their protests for the time being."
YUN_King_of_Yunnan2:0 "The 'King of Yunnan'"
YUN_King_of_Yunnan2_desc:0 "The title of the 'King' of Yunnan has been passed from Provincial governor to Provincial governor since the time of Cai E, given the inmense power the governor yields over the frontier province. Long Yun, despite being a staunch anti-monarchist, has graciously accepted the title, and the power and legitimacy his position gives him over the province is undeniable."
YUN_Democratic_Fortress2:0 "Democratic Fortress"
YUN_Democratic_Fortress2_desc:0 "Despite its distance from the capital and relative isolation, Yunnan has become more than a warlord fiefdom. With working universities, a growing industrial sector, a judicial system, a representative legislature and a locally elected assembly, Yunnan is one of the few provinces in China that can trully be considered Democratic."
YUN_NRA_prevailed:0 "NRA Prevailed"
YUN_NRA_prevailed_desc:0 "Despite the failure in the Northern Expedition and all setbacks set by Tang Jiyao, Long Yun and the many other enemies of the Kuomintang, the National Revolutionary Army has managed to prevail in the province. As for what the future awaits for Yunnan, it's up to the new Governor..."
YUN_Land_Problem:0 "Land Redistribution"
YUN_Land_Problem_desc:0 "After a thorough analysis made by Miao Yuntai, it has been deemed necessary that we perform an agricultural reform in order to improve our cultivation and extraction efficiency, as well as improving the working conditions of peasants and small landlords in our nation."
YUN_Expansionism2:0 "Expansionism"
YUN_Expansionism2_desc:0 "China lies in chaos after decades of warlord conflicts and a weak Beijing government. As such, Yunnan cannot sit idly and wait for Beijing to come to its rescue. We must act quickly and seize the neighbouring land in order to secure our financial and geopolitical stability!"
YUN_emergent_financial_measures:0 "Emergent Financial Measures"
YUN_emergent_financial_measures_desc:0 "As our Provincial economy moves forward, we should also try to keep up with it financially. New overtures of investment have opened, new companies have opened, new factories have settled, and we should encourage all via our financial measures to continue improving Yunnan and making it the model Province."
YUN_cult_of_personality:0 "Cult of Personality"
YUN_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "The weakness of Tang was his lack of touch with the average citizen. His lavish lifestyle, and his boastful attitude ended up being his downfall. Our new governor understands this, and using his position as an officer, a local celebrity and a family man, he plans to cause sympathy in every soldier, politician and working class family alike."
YUN_continue_isolation:0 "Continue Isolation"
YUN_continue_isolation_desc:0 "Yunnan, perhaps thanks to its geographical location, remains as one of the few spots in China that hasn't completely fallen into chaos, nepotism and repression. Perhaps things should stay this way, and we should try to foster a more stable province. China has enough war as it is, they don't need us to throw our hat in the ring."
YUN_the_mountain_fortress:0 "The Mountain Fortress"
YUN_the_mountain_fortress_desc:0 "Our province is already hard enough to assault, as enemies are restricted to small valleys and narrow mountain passages. However, that doesn't mean it's unassailable. We can still improve its defenses by setting up defensive lines in said valleys and passages. That should be enough to deter any potential attackers."
YUN_join_the_left_KMT_committee:0 "Join the Left KMT Committee"
YUN_join_the_left_KMT_committee_desc:0 "With the revolutionary government struggling against Beijing, it is only right that we follow the true Kuomingtang into bringing the revolution to China!"
YUN_join_the_right_KMT_committee:0 "Join the Right KMT Committee"
YUN_join_the_right_KMT_committee_desc:0 "Despite Wang Jingwei's resistance in Fujian, their version of the Kuomintang clearly stands at odds with what Sun Yat-Sen truly wanted. Instead, we shall seek to join those who really follow what Sun Yat-Sen and Chiang Kai-Shek fought and died for!"
YUN_Kuomintang_government_Inititative:0 "Kuomintang Government Initiative"
YUN_Kuomintang_government_Inititative_desc:0 "With our allies behind us, it's finally time to make a comeback and save China from the Emperor, the Japanese and the Warlords alike. The time of reckoning is now, China will be united and free or we will die trying!"
YUN_gear_up_for_war:0 "Gear Up for War"
YUN_gear_up_for_war_desc:0 "While war is common in the rest of China, Yunnan has remained in a relatively isolated peace from the rest of China. This has played against us in the last Zhili-Fengtian war of the twenties, where our advance into Guizhou was stopped by a lack of supplies. We cannot let that happen again, and as such we should prepare for the conflicts to come."
YUN_Revive_republican_ideals:0 "Revive Republican Ideals"
YUN_Revive_republican_ideals_desc:0 "Complacency in the province has become widespread, as many people don't care anymore whether there is a central government, or a united China at all. This can't be allowed to stand, China has to be saved, and we should instill patriotism again in our population!"
YUN_Reform_KMT_Organization:0 "Reform the Kuomintang Organization"
YUN_Reform_KMT_Organization_desc:0 "The Kuomintang, or more specifically, the National Revolutionary Army branch of the Kuomintang, has hardly undergone any reforms since the Generalissimo was assassinated. We should look into restructuring our party, and begin passing reforms that may help our province ease itself into our organization."
YUN_Secure_South_China:0 "Secure South China"
YUN_Secure_South_China_desc:0 "The South China Region, encompassing Guangxi and Guangdong is a massively important region of China. Not only it is a massive agricultural producer, it's also rich in resources and possesses plenty of industry. If any region can help us succeed in our new Northern Expedition, it's that one, and as such, we need to put it under our control once more."
YUN_A_New_China:0 "A New China"
YUN_A_New_China_desc:0 "China has been reunited for the first time in decades. While there is still a long way to go before we recover from the Century of humiliation, we have still made Sun Yat-Sen and Chiang Kai-Shek proud. Long live our Generalissimo Zhu Peide, unifier of China!"
YUN_Ultimatium_To_Sichuan2:0 "Ultimatum to Sichuan"
YUN_Ultimatium_To_Sichuan2_desc:0 "The Sichuan Clique stands as the living example of why warlords cannot rule in China anymore with the recent famine. We will send an ultimatum to Sichuan to restore the rule of law of the Republic, and if they refuse, we'll send a message to all of China: The time of the warlords is at an end..."
YUN_Enter_Yangtze_River2:0 "Enter the Yangtze Valley"
YUN_Enter_Yangtze_River2_desc:0 "The Yangtze River Valley leads the way to the heart of China. Going from Sichuan all the way to Shanghai. If we wish to save China, we will need to control this vital river, and to start our hegemony, we will need to eliminate the gatekeeper of the Valley: Hunan."

YUN_Deal_with_the_leftie_KMT_desc:0 "So long as Wang Jingwei's Kuomintang stands, China will never be truly united. Their insult to Sun Yat-Sen and Chiang Kai-Shek's ideals has gone on for long enough, and we will put an end to their defiance."
YUN_Secure_Coastal_China:0 "Secure Coastal China"
YUN_Secure_Coastal_China_desc:0 "With the South secured, it's time to start the long march northwards. Unlike last time, we will take our time. The Coastline has grown economically in the last decade, and capturing it is bound to greatly secure our advance northwards as we consolidate our hold over China."
YUN_secure_northern_china:0 "Secure Northeastern China"
YUN_secure_northern_china_desc:0 "The Fengtian government, while standing in defiance to the Qing, are still traitors to the Chinese nation. Upholding purely façade of Republicanism, their warlord of a leader is nothing but a Japanese Lapdog, and it falls to us to save Manchuria from such tyrants, and return it to its rightful place in China."
YUN_secure_western_china:0 "Secure Western China"
YUN_secure_western_china_desc:0 "With the East secured, now is the time to begin the long march Westwards. So long as the Kuomintang upholds Sun Yat-Sen's ideals, it is the duty of the Republic to protect Chinese citizens, wherever they may be. As the West has recently fallen into chaos, the livelihood of many Chinese is now threatened, and it is our duty to march in and restore order."

YUN_expansion_of_the_mining_industries_desc:0 "Yunnan has, since time immemorial, been a large mining province. Despite centuries of exploration and mining, the province is still filled with valuable resources that, with enough investment, could potentially make us China's greatest Resource center."
YUN_kunming_tungsten_prospecting:0 "Expand Yunnan's Tungsten Prospecting"
YUN_kunming_tungsten_prospecting_desc:0 "While Tungsten has remained behind in terms of extraction as opposed to Tin, it is nonetheless a valuable resource in these times of war. Our government has luckily kept land surveys of the frontier archived, and while funding expeditions may prove expensive, it may yet prove vital for us."
YUN_dali_aluminium_expansion:0 "Expand Yunnan's Steel Production"
YUN_dali_aluminium_expansion_desc:0 "Yunnan's Iron mines have been operating for around 30 years, and while their yields have greatly helped our economy, there's still plenty of room for improvement. New mines can be started, old mines can be expanded, new smelters and smelting methods could be introduced to the system, all for a small investment..."
YUN_kunming_bauxite_refining:0 "Improve Kunming's Bauxite Refining Methods"
YUN_kunming_bauxite_refining_desc:0 "While the province is definitely not short in resources to produce aluminium, it's definitely lacking in its refining process. With an extra investment, we can potentially expand our aluminium output and be able to supply our own demand for the resource."
YUN_guixi_chromimum_depostits:0 "Expand Guixi's Chromium Mines"
YUN_guixi_chromimum_depostits_desc:0 "The frontier isn't the only place that's ripe with resources in our province. In the province of Guixi, there are several Chromium-rich regions which sit largely unexploited. With our investments, we could greatly change this."

YUN_reclaiming_birthright_desc:0 "We shall ride forth from our mountain fortress of Yunnan and flood into China with the force of the heavens themselves. The Tang dynasty will be resurrected from the pages of history like a phoenix from the ashes, and Tang Jiyao, honored son of Lao Tzu and heir to the mantle of the Great Tang, shall be the holy, righteous beacon that guides us to this destiny. The future of China is, and only can be, Tang!"
YUN_young_mandate:0 "The Young Mandate"
YUN_young_mandate_desc:0 "Our claim to the Mandate of Heaven is currently weak and fragile. We must exicies the cancerous tumors that plague the Great Tang before we can truly begin to rebuild and revive our long-forgotten legacies. Republicans, Socialists, Qing loyalists, and more will all be brought to justice or the sword so that the Great Tang may reign free and unhindered."
YUN_tanglarp_code:0 "A Modernized Tang Code"
YUN_tanglarp_code_desc:0 "Serving as one of the greatest legal codexes in all of Eastern history the Tang Code has been revitalized and modernized to fit our new empire. With the penalty of the crime being based on both the severity of the offense and the difference in social rank between the involved parties, this will ensure that rational and fair justice prevails as much as possible without flying in the face of our Legalist principles."
YUN_silkroad_but_opium:0 "A Modern ‘Silk’ Road"
YUN_silkroad_but_opium_desc:0 "The old trade roads of the Middle Kingdom have been revived, bringing in massive amounts of money and goods into the Great Tang. However, it is no longer just spices and tapestries riding these caravans and convoys. Here, Opium is king, and has become the lifeblood of the new Tang economy. Though it may not be the healthiest substance for our populace to ingest, we can not deny its ability to turn a profit, and with even the Emperor enjoying this natural bounty every so often, it has begun to spread like wildfire. Once more, China is in the grip of the poppy plant, but at least now all of China can benefit from its profits."
YUN_daoistgang:0 "Taoist Revivalism"
YUN_daoistgang_desc:0 "As the descendants and heirs of Lao Tzu, it is our duty to spread Taoism across all of Great Tang. The principles of harmony, simplicity, patience, compassion, and ‘going with the flow’ shall form the basis of our new spiritual culture. Drawing inspiration from Legalism and Confucianism as well, the foreign beliefs and religions that have poisoned China for so long shall be driven away as we endeavor to make the Great Tang both pure and pious."

YUN_poet_of_shangai2_desc:0 "Empress-Dowager and Regent Xue Tao seeks to usher in a new Golden Age for the Great Tang, replicating the florusing era of poetry, fine art, and high culture that the Tang Dynasty of old was once famous for.

yun_tanglarp.1.t:0 "A King of Yunnan?"
yun_tanglarp.1.d:0 "Though it has been hard-fought, we have secured our position as rulers of Yunnan. All throughout these high, mist covered mountains and deep gorges, the people of Yunnan know that Governor Tang Jiyao is their lord. However, with his powerbase now secured and his political enemies dealt with, Tang has begun to ponder on the possibilities available to him now in his newly stabilized position. \n\nSure, his intent has long been to simply reside in these secluded hills, lording over his fortune and smuggling his opium until he died an old and happy man. However, something has always nagged at Tang, almost as if a higher power was driving him towards a yet unknown destiny. Tang had always felt that he was destined for greatness, but he had thought he had achieved it already. Here he stood at the most powerful man in Yunnan and one of the most powerful leaders in all China, but yet he felt empty, incomplete - as if a part of his identity was missing. \n\nThen, in a flash, it all clicked and lined up for the general. Whether it was the opium flowing through his lungs or the alcohol coursing through his veins, or perhaps even delirium from the stress of running a warlord state, Tang had an epiphany. He was Tang Jiyao, yes as he always had been, but now he finally realized his missing piece, for he was something more - he wasn’t just any Tang, he was the Tang. Heir to the centuries-dead Tang dynasty, descendant of the honorable Lao Tzu and and the great Gaozu, and the only rightful ruler of China and occupant of the Dragon Throne by birthright! \n\nThis revelation would have destroyed the minds of lesser men, but not the mind of a trueborn king! Tang knew that these claims would make him sound mad, deranged, and absolutely unfit to rule, but if he could convince enough of his adjundants to follow along, he might just be able to pull this off. Or maybe it is better to keep these drug-fueled ‘revelations’ to himself, lest he jeopardize everything he had worked so hard for already."
yun_tanglarp.1.a:0 "What the hell was in that last hit."
yun_tanglarp.1.b:0 "I am the one, true Tang!"


yun_tanglarp.2.t:0 "The Children of Lao Tzu Rule Once More"
yun_tanglarp.2.d:0 "The heavens sing of our triumphs and our ancestors smile down upon us, for we have seized the Mandate of Heaven and taken back the lands of the Tang Mandate of old and have united all of China under our forces. Our armies and hordes march from Kunming to Beijing and all lands in between, for the Middle Kingdom is finally ours. The King in Yunnan, Tang Jiyao, has seized his claimed birthright and has resurrected a dynasty that has lay dead and forgotten for over a millenia. Now, with his victory, this dynasty of old shall be extinct no longer. Great Tang, the dynasty of Gaozu, the first Tang emperor, and Lao Tzu, the great founder of Taoism, shall rise once more under this reborn son of Tang, and all of China will be made to kneel. The mere Governor-General or King Tang Jiyao is no more, for Tang Gaozu, heir to the Great Tang, shall take his seat upon the Dragon Throne, reigning as the newest Emperor of China. May Great Tang last a thousand years!"
yun_tanglarp.2.a:0 "Let us usher in a new golden age for the Middle Kingdom under the Great Tang!"

yun_tanglarp.3.t:0 "The Struggles of A New Mandate"
yun_tanglarp.3.d:0 "We have utterly annihilated most of the enemies and parasites that infected our Great Tang. The Xinhai-inspired republicans have been destroyed, the Qing loyalists have all been eradicated like that foul familial line, and foreign devils have been annihilated or exiled. However, our empire still aches from internal strife and issues. Our people have been devastated by non-stop war for decades. Famine grips much of the interior, especially in Sichuan. The Japanese still eye our coasts and our resources, and all of China aches, yearning for a return to peace. Emperor Gaozu must act quickly and fix the issues that ail his new empire, or the Great Tang will fall just as quickly as it rose, once again tossed into the dustbin of history."
yun_tanglarp.3.a:0 "We brought China to the brink of ruin, and now we must be the ones who fix it."

yun_tanglarp.4.t:0 "The Fifth Buddhist Persecution"
yun_tanglarp.4.d:0 "The foul foreign plague that is Buddhism has long infected the hearts and minds of our people. It was the first Tang dynasty that fully allowed this alien cancer to take root in our native lands, allowing it to spread across the Middle Kingdom unfettered. The moral decay caused by this false faith caused the decadence and complacency that led the first Tang mandate to ruin, despite the heroic actions of our ancestor Emperor Wuzong. \n\nWith the Mandate of Heaven now in the hands of Emperor Gaozu of Tang, and the Great Tang finally restored, we will not make these same mistakes again. These Buddhist parasites will be ripped from our body and cast out for good. Monasteries and Buddhist land will be seized back by the state, and their fortunes will be taken and redistributed to Taoist and Confucianist temples around the nation instead, of course with a small portion going to the Emperor as with anything else in the empire. Like the Three Disasters of Wu and the Zhou Copper Seizure, another major blow has been dealt to the Buddhist menace. Soon, all of China shall be free from their taint."
yun_tanglarp.4.a:0 "We shall cut the head off this vile snake."

yun_tanglarp.5.t:0 "Every Empire Deserves Tribute"
yun_tanglarp.5.d:0 "Like the Great Tang of old, our new empire must establish tributary states to receive income to fund our ambitious plans for national revival. We have already begun to piecemeal the interior of the nation to lesser nobles, warlords, and other figures who have proven their loyalty, granting them governorship positions and great deals of autonomy. However, outside our borders in the wild regions of Central Asia, Korea, Mongolia, and Tibet - untamed lands long claimed by the Chinese but rarely fully conquered - their lay lands and peoples ripe for conquest and subjugation. In our renewed position of strength, we could reach out to these border states, forcing them to bend the knee or die, but this would likely destabilize our nation as the people just again begin to get used to the bliss of peace. What shall we do?"
yun_tanglarp.5.a:0 "We do not need any more foreigners within our lands."
yun_tanglarp.5.b:0 "The border states will pay, in gold or in blood."

yun_tanglarp.6.t:0 "Notes from the Tang Masters of the Pen" 
yun_tanglarp.6.d:0 "The Tang Dynasty is typically referred to as a not only a high point in Chinese culture, but the absolute pinnacle of the Chinese poetic tradition. With great masters such as Meng Haoran, Jia Dao, Li Bai, Qian Qi, Zhang Jiuling, Wang Wan, Li Yi, and so many more, it's impossible to land on a single greatest poet. These great masters of the oratory and literary arts are one of the greatest legacies of our dynasty - serving as one of the zeniths of our shared culture, and as such much their works must be spread. Above all, the work of the main masters of Li Bai, Du Fu, and Wang Wei - widely regarded as the three greatest poets in Chinese history, shall become mandatory reading for all citizens. New poets will be encouraged to rise up and add to our shared lexicon, and, through sheer will, we shall force a new high age of culture and art in our new Great Tang. We shall reclaim the legacies of our ancestors, for Chinese culture and high art is the greatest in the world!"
yun_tanglarp.6.a:0 "A time will come to ride the wind and cleave the waves, I’ll set my cloudlike sail to cross the sea which raves."

yun_tanglarp.7.t:0 "An Old, Modern Dynasty" 
yun_tanglarp.7.d:0 "The Tang Dynasty under Emperor Gaozu of Tang has led the Great Tang to a remarkable and near-miraculous resurgence. Under his stern rule, China has seen itself hurdle into the past while still maintaining some semblance of modernity. Feudalism has seen its resurgence, with the old tax and tributary system from the Tang Dynasty granting fiefdoms to warlords, priests, and other loyal stewards of the Emperor. Opium flows all throughout these lands as the lifeblood of our industry, with the illicit substance being carried across the Opium Road and throughout Asia. True piety has been restored with the three grand Chinese faiths of Legalism, Confucianism, and above all, Taoism reign across the land and are all endorsed and proselytized by the state. A new golden age has been ushered in over the Middle Kingdom just like the original Tang Dynasty of old, and all of our people prosper with the poems and songs of our national identity and revitalized culture. Under Emperor Gaozu, all of China has been made to prosper, and our people finally know order and stability. The Great Tang has risen again, and with tradition at their side, may it never collapse!"

yun_tanglarp.8.t:0 "A Modern, Old Dynasty" 
yun_tanglarp.8.d:0 "The Tang Dynasty under Emperor Gaozu of Tang has led the Great Tang to a remarkable and near-miraculous resurgence. Under his benevolent rule, China has seen itself hurdle into the future without losing touch of its past. The Emperor rules as a semi-constitutional monarch, adhering to the Tang Legal code and pursuing a reformist, egalitarian agenda. Opium flows throughout these lands, but the true lifeblood of our economy has been the expansion of our gracious tributary system and the cultural revival we have ushered in with funding from the state. True piety has been restored with the three grand Chinese faiths of Legalism, Confucianism, and above all, Taoism reign across the land and are all endorsed and proselytized by the state. A new golden age has been ushered in over the Middle Kingdom just like the original Tang Dynasty of old, and all of our people prosper with the poems and songs of our national identity and revitalized culture.

It is on this hallowed throne, nestled deep within the Hall of Supreme Harmony safely in the center of the Forbidden City in Beijing, that the Emperors of China have ruled from for centuries. However, this decadent and opulent ‘divine utensil’ has one key issue with it - its location. \n\nWith Emperor Gaozu of Tang’s consolidation of power being all but assured now, the mad Emperor has decided to move the empire’s capital to the old Tang capital of Chang’an, now present-day Xi’an. In the ancient city stands the great Bell Tower of Xi’an, a mighty fortress constructed during the early Ming to house several ancient bronze-cast bells crafted and used during the Tang Dynasty. Due to being built after our ancestors’ fall though, this breathtaking example of traditional Chinese architecture lacks one key thing our emperor needs: a throne. \n\nTo rectify this horrendous position he has found himself in, Emperor Gaozu has made the simple, yet mad, decision to have his lackeys physically rip out the Dragon Throne from its current resting place in the Hall of Supreme Harmony and having it transported to the Bell Tower of Xi’an to serve as the new center of the Chinese imperial system. Emperor Gaozu shall have his throne, and the Great Tang shall have its time-honored capital; a true win-win for all, well almost all. Many of our citizens across the nation seem to be taken aback or even offended by this act, but our glorious emperor shall pay them no heed. Why should he, for what is a mere peasant when compared to a living god."

yun_tanglarp.16.d:0 "In a room swirling with opium smoke and burning incense, the Emperor, in all his glory, sat slumped on a sofa lost in another poppy-fueled daze. The stress of rule had begun to get to him, and each and every day he turned further to the Pin Gon for relief. Outside his palace in the Xi’an Belltower, hundreds of angry Buddhists protested day and night over the new state-enforced bans against foreign religions, and each day more joined their ranks. However, Xi’an is far from the only city to be experiencing these growing pains of the resurgent Tang Dynasty, for pro-Buddhist riots and demonstrations have broken out across all of China. These angry former-monks and priests, disgruntled pious civilians, and Buddhist fundamentalists all have banded together in their hatred for his new law, and have begun to cause considerable damage to the Great Tang’s internal stability. \n\nThis backlash to his righteous policy had begun to make the mad man think he may have not made the best decision in emulating the former Emperor Wuzong of all the Tang monarchs. As the opium began to further spread through his blood, the Emperor began to hallucinate and daydream of eras long past and golden ages long gone. He saw before him in his drug-fueled stupor the former glories of the Tang Dynasty, before monarchs like Wuzong tried to snuff out the taint of Buddhism. He saw a golden age unlike China has ever seen since, with glittering cities and jubilant people living in harmony fusing both the ideals of foreign religions like the Nesotrian and Assyrian Churches and even the ‘vile’ Buddhist faith itself. \n\nAs his eyes rolled and his head swayed about, the Emperor began to realize perhaps it was not Buddhism that caused the fall of the Tang, but that it was Buddhism that helped give its rise and helped enrich its culture for which it is so now widely regarded. With these new revelations becoming clear to him, the Emperor would have a choice to make when he came to from his purple haze on the future of Buddhism within the empire, now and forever. He could either continue the legacy of Emperor Wuzong, containing the ban on foreign religions, or he could instead revoke the ban, allowing our people to choose their faith at will while still living under a legally Taoist state. Alternatively, the Emperor could embrace the legacy of the young Tang Dynasty of eras past, and once more fully embrace Buddhism so as to preserve national unity and to usher in a new golden age for our Great Tang as had once been done before."

yun_tanglarp.17.d:0 "Though the original Tang Dynasty is largely extinct, that has not stopped the Emperor from attempting to rewrite this fact of history. As he has consolidated his power, he has granted noble titles to swathes of his allies and close friends, and sometimes just to the highest bidder, effectively creating a new aristocratic, noble class free of the corruption and decadence of the foul Qing. \n\nParamount among these new ‘nobles’ is the honorable Tang Jiyu, the brother and time-honored ally of our godlike Emperor. In a lavish ceremony, this once mere general of the KMT has been crowned as a royal prince of the Great Tang, granting him powers and rights over all his fellow man in the nation. Now, Tang Jiyu has joined his brother atop the hierarchy of China’s new imperial mandate, being granted his own tributary fiefdom within the nation in the mountains of Yunnan, serving as steward to Kunming - the birthplace of our dynasty’s revival."

However, much of the old guard of our nation are Tang Jiyao’s allies in the KMT - the political group he threw in before he began this ambitious pursuit to claim the Mandate of Heaven. These republican generals hold great sway over the nation’s military affairs, and with Tang’s own hatred for republican ideals only growing, a choice must be made. He could either grant amnesty to these old allies and friends, allowing them to serve in his military forces ad infinitum as long as they continued to prove their loyalty. Alternatively, the King in Yunnan could silence these possible traitors where they now stood, averting the potential risk of these republican snakes stabbing our rightful emperor in the back in the future. Doing so may harm our military prowess for the time being, but we can quickly replace them with our swelling numbers."

yun_tanglarp.19.d:0 "As the opium trade further breeds profit and proliferates through our modern revival of the Silk Road of old, Emperor Gaozu has become the single largest opium dealer on Earth. More poppy and pipepack flows through our borders and markets than anywhere else on this planet, and all of its profits flow back to Great Tang and its Emperor. However, with all its profit and prosperity, this new economic reality has also greatly disturbed the business of a certain old rival of Tang Jiyao: the Green Gang. \n\nMembers of the infamous Triads, the Green Gang have long controlled much of the opium trade in China through their various dens in Shanghai. However, well before our Emperor’s rise, this petty gang sold the young general Tang Jiyao to the Anglo authorities, ratting out his opium operations and siphoning his profits and customer base as Tang and his brother were engulfed in a quagmire with the law. \n\nNever forgetting this transgression, and with Shanghai and the opium trade now in his firm grasp, our humble Emperor has decided it is time for revenge. Ordering his loyal forces into the rats’ nests of Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other major metropolis centers on the coast, every last trace of the Triads, including the foul Green Gang, will be snuffed out. Their operations shall be destroyed, their poppy fields burned, and all of their assets shall be seized. All Triad members are to be arrested or, if they resist or run, shot on sight, and these former legation ports shall burn, for no one crosses the Emperor of the Great Tang."

yun_tanglarp.20.d:0 "Even as a practical demigod as the Emperor of all China and leader of the Great Tang, the man once called Tang Jiyao is far from invincible. Long has this self-made monarch struggled with the dark demon of drug addiction, a condition only worsened by the increased stress of renewed fatherhood and nation-building, and with each passing day his need to consume more of that accursed black tar only grows; so much so that many within the imperial diet have grown nervous for their Emperor’s health. However, their fears are far from unfounded or paranoid, as without them knowing, within his chambers in the Bell Tower of Xi’an, their sickly Emperor clung to life. \n\nAfter a long night of extravagant partying and hedonistic indulgence, the holy vessel of the Mandate of Heaven found himself struggling to breathe in a pool of his own sweat and vomit and the edge of his bed. Writhing in agony and convulsing like a fish dragged up from the sea, this receptacle of divine will has been reduced to a mere babe, grasping at life desperately as the darkness began to close it, overdosing on the very thing that provided him so much comfort and relief. Crawling to the nearest door, and attempting to shout for help along the way, the ever-weakening Emperor’s life began to slip before him as reality gave way to the void; the copious amounts of opium he had ingested finally taking their final toll on the haggard, dying man. With the room swirling and darkening more and more as the moments dragged on, Tang knew death was at his door, and soon he would likely pass from this world. With a final ounce of his energy, the writhing Emperor screamed out for help one last time before total darkness claimed the last of his sight and his body fell into one final, violent convulsion. Now, it is up to fate or divine intervention to see if this founder of the resurgent Great Tang survives."

yun_tanglarp.21.t:0 "A Queen Fit for a King"
yun_tanglarp.21.d:0 "As the great King in Yunnan Tang Jiyao continues to surge forth from Kunming and into the heart of China itself, his self-inflated ego and ambition only continue to grow. As the lands of the Southern Tang grow larger, so too does Tang Jiyao’s need to further this affect of divinity and Imperial regality he has put on; an affect he as adopted so thoroughly that many of his closest associates no longer recognize where the old Tang stops and this new ‘Emperor’ personality starts. \n\nRegardless of their fears and concerns, Tang has further pushed on, and now seeks to elevate his position and cement his burgeoning dynasty even further, and what better way to solidify a dynasty than by securing its survival with an heir! Every King needs his Queen, and Tang Jiyao is no different. Though he has his exhaustive harem, Tang desires a true woman of elegance to make his Queen, and eventually his Empress. While the future Emperor does indeed have children, his eldest son being an integral part of his government, they have no claim to nobility. For China, and the Dynasty itself, Tang simply must have a child with a woman of noble birth.\n\nCurrently, of all the women in China and beyond, Tang has his sights set on three - each a delicate rose and worthy queens in their own right. The first woman to steal the affection of our King is a young actress who has taken Shanghai and the rest of China by storm. Going by the name of Li Lili, Tang caught a show of hers during his last visit to Shanghai during his time smuggling opium, and after a brief love affair between the two, he has been obsessed with her ever since. Though she is far from any true noble, neither is Tang, and he has been fiercely determined to make her his bride, spending ludicrous amounts of treasury funds on lavish gifts for the young moviestar. However, this ‘Mae West of the East’ is not the only woman that Tang has been seeing outside of his nights with his concubines. \n\nFar to the North of the Southern Tang lies the Eastern Steppe and the lands of Mongolia. Tang has frequently made trips and excursions into these lands to both smuggle opium and during his time in the KMT, and on one such occasion, a beautiful noblewoman made him swoon, and she too has been the recipient of many a treasure caravan or luxurious gift from the King. A member of the Bogd Khan’s court and a true purple-blooded royal, Tseyenpil would be a perfect choice for Tang to choose as his bride. Not only is she of noble birth, which would grant him some much needed legitimacy and ties to true royalty, but with her position so close to the Bogd Khan, their union could bear the fruits of cooperation between Mongolia and the Southern Tang. \n\nFinally, stands another pearl from the bustling city of Shanghai. Though young, the immensely talented poet Chiang Ai-ling has also caught Tang’s eye. Of noble birth - related to the honored admiral Huang Yisheng - this flower of Shanghai has earned a name for herself with her talent for poetry, art, and design. Meeting her while walking through Shanghai as she recited poetry to a small crowd in Century Park, Tang was instantly ensnared by her wit, charm, and talent. Though not a true royal like Tseyenpil and not as famous as Li Lili, this young artist has become the object of his obsessions just the same, and would make a fitting bride for our resurgent Tang Dynasty. \n\nUltimately, the choice is up to the King, for he will have to live with the choice he makes more than anyone else. Already his aides were preparing a delegation to send to his choice of bride, ready to shower his chosen woman with gifts and pageantry as they bring her back to Kunming. Now, the only choice to make would be where to go: Urga or Shanghai?"

yun_tanglarp.24.d:0 "The nation mourns and our people cry as the news of the passing of Emperor Gaozu of Tang spreads throughout the nation. The officially announced cause of death has been a general heart attack, with the hastily assembled regency council of Tang’s closest generals and ministers not wanting it to leak to the wider public that our divine empire died of an opium overdose. \n\nWith his tragic and sudden passing, a new monarchy must be chosen to rule over the Great Tang, but who? Before the council lies four main candidates for selection, each with their own benefits and issues. The first option is quite obvious, being Tang Shaoxiang. Shaoxiang is Tang Jiyao’s only adult child, and has worked as a teacher and academic all across Southern China since his youth, now working as a chief instructor within Yunnan’s prestigious Yunnan Military Academy after his own studies at both Whampoa Academy and Baoding Academy. With a sound military and academic mind free of the snares of opium that his father fell prey to and free of the caustic ambition that fueled his father’s rise, Shaoxiang is likely the most fitting candidate, but lacks the ambition of his late dad. While never directly stating it, the late Emperor was quite clear that he had interned his son’s younger brother to inherit the Throne, as Shaoxiang was not of ‘true royal blood.’\n\nThe second option would be to crown the deceased Emperor’s brother and close friend, Tang Jiyu, as the new Emperor. As Tang Jiyao’s closest sibling, he would be a natural choice, and the far more stable option. Having the same blood as the late Emperor, Jiyu is a natural choice, given his ‘purple blood’ when compared to the Emperor’s eldest son. However, Tang Jiyu too struggles with the demon of opium addiction, and few within our council want to risk losing another sovereign to addiction. Additionally, rumors have circulated over his loyalties, with many feeling that Tang Jiyu, given his past KMT links and history as a second-tier general may lead him to be easily influenced by the military. \n\nAlternatively, the far more ludicrous solution would be to either crown Shi Lixia, Tang’s niece and adopted daughter, or the Empress of China herself as the Empress-Regent, giving her complete and total authority over the nation. Not since Wu Zetian has a woman ruled over China, and to do so now would be near-unthinkable. However, either of these women are experienced and intelligent enough to lead, and as the wife of Emperor Gaozu, many within the nation already see Tang’s widow as the rightful choice. Rivaling her is Shia Lixia, Tang’s own niece famed for being Yunnan’s first female doctor that has lived under her uncle’s care for decades. Trained in both Asia and Europe, Lixia picked up some minor Progressive attitudes during her stay in France, and as such is expected to be the most humanist and ‘liberal’ of the possible Tang heirs. This debate has raged for days, and has no end in sight yet, but when it finally finishes, the Tang Dynasty shall have its new Emperor...or Empress."

Of note however, is that there exists an old legend in his family that the Hu family are long-distant relatives of the last Tang Dynasty emperor. Though hard to substantiate or prove, it has aroused the curiosity of many. To make this potential claimant a non-issue, we could buy his loyalty by granting him the honorary title of Duke of Hu, reviving the dukedom system of old China, despite Hu Shih’s own personal distaste for monarchism.

New doctrines and techniques have been introduced as ideas from the Mongolian army meld with Chinese strategy.

Under her rule, our military has flourished as it emulates the warrior spirit of Genghis Khan and her namesake. \n\nMore shockingly however, has been her decision to entirely reverse the drug policy of her deceased husband, as she has pushed to fully ban the opium trade in China.

Taking the name of the famed Tang-era poet, the Empress Dowager has done good on her promise to revitalize China’s culture after being nearly destroyed in the era of warlords. Though she has left much of the politicking and rulership duties to her endless host of councillors, eunuchs, and aides, Empress Dowager Xue Tao has instead poured all of her energy into revitalizing Chinese culture. Holding poetry competitions, art gallas, classical concerts, fashion shows, and more across the nation while uplifting and being aided by talented artists, artisans, and writers from all across the Middle Kingdom including her own lady-in-waiting and childhood friend Fatima Mohideen, the woman once called Eileen has pioneered a new age of Chinese art. From the great Xi’an Belltower - the Tang palace since our dynasty’s rebirth - she has drafted literary masterpieces and weaved wondrous new cheongsams like those which the nation has never seen. Pushing for a larger role for women in the nation, she has even begun a feminist campaign to empower the modern Chinese woman - though this has been met with mixed results unlike her artistic pursuits given the nation’s conservative slant. With new plays, poems, and novels spilling forth from her pen without delay - each a work of art upheld in our pantheon of high culture - the cultural golden age she and her late-husband began has now exploded into a nation-wide phenomena. Though many feel as though these artistic pursuits are a waste of resources, the untold millions that make up the masses still cry her name and pray to her picture hung in every home. And what can these detractors truly complain about? China is the greatest nation on Earth, and only under the Tang Dynasty has our nation finally been reunited.

Although she lives in the lap of luxury while kleptocratically siphoning off funds and other privileges she ‘requires’ from the realm, the Empress also works diligently to ensure that the Middle Kingdom runs effectively while also providing enough for the peasant masses so that her rule is ever-secured. A two-faced leader showing love and care to the masses while ruthlessly eliminating any opposition from the shadows, all as she selfishly amasses wealth beneath the Dragon Throne like it was her own hoard, Li Lili ake Empress Qu Zhou has also done a lot of good for our kingdom, at least when compared to the mess Tang Jiyao made, fixing many of his mistakes and sorting out the corrupt, byzantine bureaucracy he created while he was up to his eyeballs in opium and whores, even rolling back the remnants of her dead husband’s anti-Buddhist practices while enacting protection for Tang and Zhou-era Buddhist sites like the Longmen Grottoes and the ‘Wordless Stele’ at the Qian Mausoleum, also spreading these protections to Taoism, Confucianism, and other Chinese traditional folk practices like her namesake before her. \n\nIn a way, the Great Tang that Tang Jiyao haphazardly built has been erased as Empress Wu Zhao fixes all the messes he made to turn our dynasty into a functional monarchist state. However, as this new Wu Zhao carves her own path for the Great Tang to follow, and with her own bitter feelings towards the former Emperor well known within her inner-circle and among her mandarins, perhaps it is finally time for this Wu Zhao of today to fully emulate the Wu Zhao of old by casting off the deadweight that was Tang Jiyao’s false dynasty once and for all, in order to create a dynasty for herself - a new Zhou Dynasty for the world to behold. Like Wu Zetian before her, Li Lili could cast off the Tang name fully, creating her own Zhou dynasty while renaming the royal family from the new House of Li to the new House of Zhou, though doing so would require her to begin a campaign revealing the true villainy of her former husband to the masses in order to gain their support, but that should not be too much of an issue as most despised the former emperor, and with most having recognized the current empress as the true holder of the Mandate of Heaven, either right away or after the loudest detractors were all disappeared. So, should Wu Zhao create her own dynasty to finally remove the foul taint of Tang Jiyao’s corrupt incompetence and despicability from history, or shall she continue to reform and remake the Great Tang in her own image?"

Seeking to further entrench our restored Tang Dynasty as the bastion of Taoist thought, the Emperor has moved to officially elevate the 63rd Celestial Master and Living Buddha Zhang Enpu, ancestor of the great Zhang Daoling of the Eastern Han, as a Prince of the Tang Dynasty. Furthermore, the Celestial Master and his entourage have been lavishly rewarded with new estates and privileges, while the Celestial Master himself has been elevated to be the Patron of the First Temple Under Heaven, also known as the White Cloud Temple, the Abbey of the White Clouds, or the Baiyun Monastery.

Focused on healthcare reform due to her time as a doctor, and devoted to liberalizing this authoritarian warlordist empire, Shi Lixian is determined to change the Great Tang for the better, but is torn on how to do so. Split between Liberalist ideas picked up in Berlin and Algiers, and Socialist ideas picked up in the Rhine Valley and Paris, Lixia must decide to pursue a Humanistic Capitalist experience that stands on the side of Liberalism and fair market economics, or a Social Democratic society supported by a true welfare state and mildly Socialist financial policy, all while the reactionary old guard tries to resist in order to keep their drug empire alive and thriving."

However, much of the elders and women within the Tang family, such as Tang Jiyao’s own sister, thought that Shi Lixia was poor marriage material, being seen as bad tempered, unaccustomed to helping in housework, and thinking very highly of her own self, and as such Tang Jiyao and the rest of the Tang family rejected the marriage proposal. Not too long after, Tang Shaoxiang instead married the younger sister of Chen Lianbo, president of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce and president of the Guangzhou branch of the British HSBC Bank, during his own studies, and so Shi Lixia left the Tang family in a rage, running far away to study literature, medicine, and poetry in Japan, Britain, Germany, and France, picking up progressive ideals along the way, only finally returning to her adoptive family upon hearing of Tang Jiyao’s own rise, and at her uncle’s personal behest. \n\nHowever, despite this past resistance, some within the Tang family and their inner circle now value the medical and literary career Shi Lixia has built for herself overseas and the capable woman she has forged herself into, and now they all push for the old flame to be rekindled, citing that the bloodline should be kept pure in this new dynasty while boldly claiming that it is what Tang Jiyao would have wanted, among a dozen other excuses, explanations, and rationalizations they peddle, like stating that one could take the other on as a concubine if need be, to try and further sway opinions and curry favor as they seek to gain influence over the monarchy. But there is one tiny snag in their plan, for Tang Shaoxiang is still happily married to his wife, and Shi Lixia - despite self-admittedly still holding affection for Tang Shaoxiang - has found a new, possibly more fitting partner in her long term love affair with fellow poet Yang Yuqing, although she has stated numerous times that she has sworn off the idea of marriage altogether.\n\nOutside the family, many Chinese monarchists and conservatives have also moved to support the original romance and push for a full marriage between Tang Shaoxiang and Shi Lixia, stating that this would be the perfect way to establish a true and new Tang bloodline, cementing the renewed Tang dynasty as true royalty. As expected however, the pushback to such an idea is just as strong, and largely centered around Tang’s old allies in the KMT, as well as by Tang Shaoxiang and Shi Lixia themselves, but what does a newly crowned monarch truly know? Regardless, a decision on how to handle this uneasy and difficult subject must be reached by the Tang family and their councilors soon, for the future of our dynasty depends on it."

Although opium cultivation areas exist all across East Asia, there exists a higher concentration of these illicit opium farms and production centers in the Golden Triangle than anywhere else as opium cultivation in Burma alone dates back to the 18th century under the Konbaung dynasty, and a large part of its modern growth can be attributed to China’s illegal but growing appetite for the substance over the last few decades since the Opium Wars and rise in failing anti-opium legislation that rose in their wake within the Qing government and the following new Warlord Era we now found ourselves in. Imperialist meddling be damned, opium is an ugly but widespread lifeblood of Chinese society - especially in Tang’s Yunnan.

Immersed in her native culture surrounded by her family, friends, and old life, the Empress began to become overwhelmed with the two worlds she had become torn between. Riding out on horseback into the Steppe with a small group of her most loyal guards and ladies-in-waiting, Genepil left the hustle and bustle of the imperial caravan temporarily stationed at Urga in order to contemplate the future of her domain among the peaceful, beautiful solitude only the Steppe that raised her could offer. Torn between continuing this life and dynasty thrust upon her or throwing it all away to re-embrace her own identity and the culture of her people, while also seeking to alleviate the plight of her fellow Mongols however she can, our Empress organized her myriad thoughts and worries into a final debate she would hash out before returning to her people, possibly reborn as a new form of monarch bearing a new heraldry and banner. She could either continue on reforming this Great Tang left to her to the best of her ability while continuing her Sino-Mongolian syncretism, integrating the Steppe along the way, or she could burn down the false dynasty created by her drug-addled dead husband in order to build a new and truly syncretic Sino-Mongolian dynasty based on the only one of its kind to exist before - the Great Yuan. Alternatively, she could just release a loyal, autonomous Mongol state under the Bogd Khan, granting her people the freedom she cannot attain for herself while she focuses on duties greater than herself in order to guide China alone.

These fanatics have hoped for our eventual and so-called inevitable conquest of Greater China, Central Asia, Siberia and much of wider Russia, Southeast Asia, and other extraneous territories at the fringes, though expectadley most of the party has found them to be beyond mad.

With a general look already decided upon, all Li Lili must decide now is whether the banner should use the character of her regal name Zhao, in honor of her namesake the original Wu Zhao aka Wu Zetian while also enshrining her own importance and legacy along the way even if it is seen as narcissism and an affront to tradition by many, or with the characters of the original Wu Zhou dynasty itself, honoring the legacy of Wu Zetian without self-aggrandizing herself to megalomaniacal proportions.

Taking the regal name, the new Empress-Regnant shall rule over the Tang Dynasty. Much like her namesake, Wu Zetian hungers greatly for power.

A gambler, an opium addict, and a lover of the sins of the flesh, her father in many ways is much like her late husband Tang Jiyao. However, what her father lacked in decency, he made up for it with a deep passion for the high arts - a passion that would ingrain itself in the young Eileen, paving the way for her future. Learning Tang-era poetry since the age of 2, Eileen has grown into one of China’s most popular - if also youngest - nationally acclaimed poets, and along with her love of fashion design, modernist and alternative-history writings, feminism, and screenwriting, she has risen to become the paragon of high culture and art in the Empire. Chang Ai-ling now stands as the face of the new Tang Dynasty, taking the name of Xue Tao after the famous Tang-era poet.

Trained as a general in the KMT army and following his brother to Yunnan following the disastrous Northern Expedition, Emperor Li stuck close to his kin and rode his ambitious wave to the top of Yunnan’s, and now all of China’s, hierarchy.

The Grand Council itself is made up of four members, each handpicked by the late Emperor himself, and is assisted in their duty by the Grand Secretariat - the Empire's main administrative body under the Dragon Throne - and a horde of accompanying mandarins and eunuchs. Namely, these 4 high nobles are the Empress-consort herself, Gaozu's brother Tang Jiyu, the late Emperor's eldest son Tang Shaoxing and Miao Yuntai, the man whom almost single-handedly saved our economy prior to the reclamation. Until a new Emperor of this reborn Tang dynasty is chosen, these four shall rule the Empire, bringing a modicum of stability in a time of great chaos and mourning."

As a disciple of perhaps the first nation that embraced the fruits of Enlightenment and Liberty, France, through the guiding hand of our Empress, we shall uphold the true legacy of the Tang Empire by bringing the achievements of progress and liberty from other nations of education, welfare and so on, but tailored for Chinese conditions so our people will prosper, while not burdened by the legacy of Western imperialism or warlordism."

In order to do this, the Empire shall be organized under militaristic lines, inspired by our Emperor’s experiences and studies in the Land of the Rising Sun, with all facets of our nation centralized and modernized through Japanese-inspired doctrines under the rule of the Emperor and his most trustworthy subordinates, comprised of experienced statesmen and military men who have proven their loyalty, sweeping away corrupt gentry and warlords alike.

His ascension to said throne has been marked by suspicious movements within the Royal Court as well as Tang Jiyu - now Emperor Li - begins to shift more and more power into the hands of his corrupted subordinates, with various important duties of state and crown being rapidly delegated to the various generals, warlords, financiers, and other dubious underlings in his employ, handling the day to day governance of the Great Tang’s many ever-increasingly autonomous subdivisions through corruption and graft as China now finds itself led by a warlord in emperor’s clothing once more."

Over time, Emperor Li hopes to have his Neo-Fubing militiamen slowly supplant the wider imperial army in matters of security, espionage, and policing, ensuring that the Emperor always has a direct hand in how the empire is handled going forward, for even if the rest of the armed forces does not agree with the Emperor’s decrees, the Neo-Fubing always will."

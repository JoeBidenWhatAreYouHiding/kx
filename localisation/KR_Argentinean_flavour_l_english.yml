arg_flavour.1.d:0 "The Uruguayan Born writer Horacio Silvestre Quiroga Forteza has passed away in the Hospital de Clinicas de Jose de San Martín. While he had been diagnosed with a very advanced case of prostate cancer, his death has still come as a shock for the Argentinean literary scene, as he chose to commit suicide before the disease could advance any further. While the Sociedad Argentina de Escritores (SADE) prepares his funeral arrangements, many of his loyal fans are writing newspaper articles in commemoration of his memory as one of the region's greatest horror and tragedy writers, with books such as 'Cuentos de Amor de locura y de muerte' having now become classics of Argentinean literature."

arg_flavour.2.d:0 "The famous Argentinean writer Leopoldo Antonio Lugones has been found dead in a resort in the town of Tigre. While an investigation was carried out, it was clear that the reason of death was suicide, as Lugones had ingested a mixture of whisky and cyanide before passing. Lugones had fervently supported the Liga Patriotica in his final years, and his suicide still came as a shock for the right wing establishment, who found legitimacy in Lugones' political writings. As the founder of the SADE, the preparation of his funeral have fallen to them, and within it, proposals for turning the birthday of its founder and one of Argentina's most influential writers into a national holiday are quickly gaining traction."

arg_flavour.3.d:0 "Based on Leopoldo Lugones' book of the same name, the movie 'Gaucho wars' has premiered this weekend, receiving rave reviews from critics, and being applauded by the public. The plot, revolving around the exploits of Argentinean national hero Martin Güemes against the Royalist forces during the war of independence, has been quickly paralleled by political commentators to the situation in Argentina in regards to the conflict ensuing in Europe and the polarization growing throughout the world. With the movie's success, the Artistas Argentinos Asociados cooperative, which had put most of their funding into the movie's production and nearly filed for bankrupcy, has now regained their investment back and earned quite the surplus for their activity, which they intend to invest back in more movies."

arg_flavour.4.d1:0 "In yet another unfortunate blow for the SADE, the modernist poet Alfonsina Storni has been found dead today. An investigation was opened on the case but it was quickly concluded as a suicide, given statements given by her acquaintances as well as evidence found on her residence and in the area where she reportedly threw herself off a breakwater into the sea in the town of Mar del Plata. Her body, found washed up on a beach by two workers, is now on its way to Buenos Aires, where funeral preparations are being prepared by the SADE as the national newspapers write about 'The Tragic Death of the Great American Poet'. While her association with Socialist Revolutionary Manuel Baldomero has caused a great deal of concern for the government, many passers-by left flowers and paid respects in the train cabin she was going to be transported later in the day, and so it may be better to leave the procession be for the time being..."

With her associations to the Socialist Manuel Baldomero Ugarte were well known, she was still considered and outsider of the Revolutionary movement. Nevertheless, Ugarte has come out writing strongly about her in La Vanguardia, and rumours abound that he has even sent parting gifts for her funeral, further reinforcing the idea that both writers had been close."

arg_flavour.5.d:0 "Having managed to fully complete his takeover, Carlés has been quick to search for allies in the Argentinean political landscape. With the Uriburu coup still very much alive in many people's memories, Carlés has started to meet with their leader, Colonel Juan Bautista Molina, in order for both organisations to come together for the future of Argentina. While many had drawn the conclusion that the Alianza Libertadora Nacionalista (Nationalist Liberation Alliance) was going to be the Patriotic League's successor, the failure of the Uriburu coup spelled disaster for their ranks, with many simply choosing to become members of both the LP and what remained of the ALN. While details of the meetings are being kept largely in secret, it is theorised that Carlés intends to utilize the ALN as a de-facto state paramilitary, given that the they already organise in a militarist fashion."

arg_flavour.6.t:0 "Jewish Immigration Restriction Bill"
arg_flavour.6.d:0 "Following the creation of the DNM and the Zwi Migdal Scandal, Carlés set his sights on the 'other' enemy of the Argentinean prosperity: The Jews. While a lack of political clout forbids him from outright expelling the jews from the nation, a new bill he introduced in Congress intends to funnel the immigration of Jewish settlers to already existing Jewish settlements in the nation, namely Colonia Dora in Santiago del Estero, Colonia Avigdor in Entre Rios and Colonia Lapin in Buenos Aires, while also putting limitations on the amount of Jews that can enter the nation per year. While there is some opposition to the bill, mainly from Jewish organisations like the Jewish Colonization Association, most opposition outlets have remained silent on the matter, maybe as a sign that the Liga Patriotica's crackdowns are finally silencing the opposition."

arg_flavour.7.t:0 "Dirección Nacional de Migraciones Created"
arg_flavour.7.d:0 "In a way to avoid the 1853 Constitution's article that no Argentinean government can restrict immigration, Carlés has authorised the creation of an Argentinean agency dedicated to investigating and authorising the entry of immigrants to the nation, known as the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones (National Directorate of Migrations). With offices being built on several hotspots of immigration like Buenos Aires, Bariloche and Puerto Iguazu, the agency will be tasked with issuing permits for people to be allowed to work and live in Argentina. While many nationalists applaud this measure, as it's going to add a layer of screening to the migrants that have been coming to Argentina, many with questionable backgrounds, the opposition members have been outspoken about the oppressive nature of said measures, with claims that these are just blatant attempts at skirting the constitution.

arg_flavour.8.d:0 "The Zwi Migdal, a Jewish organised crime group that had been thought to be completely disbanded in 1930, has resurfaced yet again in another public scandal. After yet another investigation, it seemed that the exile orders handed out during the latter years of the Uriburu dictatorship had been outright ignored, with members of the group returning to work in Argentina. With accusations from members of the Liga Patriotica denouncing the Jewish group, Carlés has taken the matter into his own hands and ordered the entirety of the suspect list arrested on the grounds of 'supporting human trafficking of European Christian women'. The Argentinean Jewish Community, in the meantime, has now come under fire of the general public, as theories that they were protecting the group are fanning the flames of anti-semitism. However, some in the opposition have been quick to point at the many reports the Jewish community made against the group that have been seemingly ignored, as well as the apparent spread of a conspiracy theory that the Liga Patriotica purposefully ignored the exile orders of this group to fan the flames against the community..."

arg_flavour.9.d:0 "In what seems to be an escalating conflict between the government and the Jewish community, a Jewish radio broadcaster named Samuel Glasserman has been imprisoned today by the Federal Police. The host of the 'La Matinee Radial Israelita', a bilingual radio program that transmitted in both Spanish and Yiddish, his radio had come under fire of the new Regime for transmitting in a foreign language, but it is only now that any charges have been raised against the broadcaster. Accused of cooperating with local socialists, his trial has been picked up particularly by the press as the evidence of the charges raised against him are considered largely circumstantial. However, given the harsher stance taken by the regime against jews, many speculate that the outcome of the trial has already been decided, and other Jewish radio hosts, like Tobias Berelejis from 'La Hora Israelita', have come out calling for Argentinean jews to move to neighbouring countries if possible."

arg_flavour.10.t:0 "Lisandro de la Torre is Found Dead"
arg_flavour.10.d:0 "The Partido Popular Democratico's founder, Lisandro de la Torre, has been found dead today in his apartment in Buenos Aires. The progressive politician, having largely taken a harsher stance towards conservatives after the assassination of Enzo Bordabehere, stepped down from public life after the Liga Patriotica's Coup in hopes of avoiding a political retaliation. However, it seems his own personal life was what got to him in the end, as a quick investigation has labelled his death as a suicide, with him even sending farewell letters to his close friends before shooting himself. Leaving behind a controversial legacy standing in the middle ground between revolutionaries and conservatives, the public still holds him in high esteem as many have attended his funeral, possibly thanks to his investigation of German intervention in the meat market in 1933."

arg_flavour.11.t:0 "'La Vida de Carlos Gardel' Premiers"
arg_flavour.11.d:0 "The movie 'La Vida de Carlos Gardel' ('The Life of Carlos Gardel') has premiered today in Argentinean cinemas and has been greatly received by the public. Directed by Alberto de Zavalia and sporting famous Argentinean Actors like Hugo del Carril and Delia Garces, the movie has drawn some controversy due to the way the plot diverges from Gardel's personal story. The plot revolves around Gardel, falling in love with a woman as he grows famous as an artist, only to sadly lose her love when he begins his international tour, ending with his ultimate demise in a plane crash; the woman is then only left with Gardel's records, but the story ends happily as they both reunite as ghosts. The issue raised by many of Gardel's most loyal fans is that the artist never had any public relationships with any woman and that the movie is taking a purposefully fictional take on the artist. The producers, however, have defended their work, claiming it was never meant to be a biography in return."

arg_flavour.12.d1:0 "Today, after a few weeks of medical consultations, General Agustin Pedro Justo has unfortunately passed away in his home. While an autopsy has yet to reveal the cause of death, it is widely believed he simply died of old age, as he was already sixty six years old, and having lived a fair share of complicated personal situations. As the leading member of the Pro-British wing of the Army, his death now marks a turning point towards the pro-German cliques, a favourable development for the GOU. However, Liborio has come out writing against the government and the military, blaming them for Justo's death. As funeral preparations are being made, it is unclear whether the protection Agustin granted Liborio will hold up after his death..."

While an autopsy has yet to reveal the cause of death, it is widely believed he simply died of old age, as he was already sixty six years old, and having lived a fair share of complicated personal situations. With the death of Liborio having turned him into a strong denouncer of the government, Justo had begun agitating in the UCRA to call for some level of opposition against our regime, who now have all but gone silent with his death. As the leading member of the Pro-British wing of the Army, his passing also marks a turning point towards the pro-German cliques, a favourable development for the GOU. While funeral arrangements are being done by his family, the government has largely remained quiet on the subject."

With Liborio having intervened in the trial, Justo retired and spent most of his retirement in his countryside homestead enjoying the protection of the chairman, writing a compilation of historian Bartolomé Mitre's works. His death has greatly impacted Liborio, who has requested to take a break from his regular activities for two weeks in order to help organise the funeral."

arg_flavour.13.d:0 "With the consolidation of our regime progressing smoothly and with our armies now standing at attention, ready to follow through on our every order, an old idea has resurfaced here in Argentina, causing uproar and fierce debate within the halls of our congress. \n\nThe topic of such fiery discussions has been the archaic, failed idea of a union of the Southern Cone - a new Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata, or United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, emulating the goals and ideas of the old failed union. This former transnational union of former Spanish colonies from the failed Viceroyalty included Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay in their entirety, as well as pieces of Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile, leading many to dub it the Provincias Unidas de Sudamérica, or United Provinces of South America. To bring back this union would cause untold amounts of instability across these lands, and require more war and bloodshed to build up and maintain. However, none can deny the splendor and prestige that would come with uniting the southern tip of the Americas under one flag. Whatever our state’s final decision, we must be sure to make it with all possibilities in mind, for none can predict how poorly reviving old ideas can potentially go."

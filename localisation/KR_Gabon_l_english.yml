### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_NTCHORERE_DESC:0 "Charles N’Tchoréré stands as the savior of our nation, the father of our free republic, and as the single most respected man in Gabon. Born in 1896, N’Tchoréré is a Libreville native, hailing from a Mpongwe family and arriving into this world as Gabon still stood under the shadow of French colonialism. Educated at the famous Catholic École Montfort, where he met and befriended other independence figures such as Louis-Emile Bigmann and Gabriel Léon M’ba, N’Tchoréré graduated in 1912 and took up a job with his family in the capital until the outbreak of war. When the fires of the Weltkrieg first sparked, N’Tchoréré enlisted in the Tirailleurs Sénégalais after a series of border clashes began on the border between French Gabon and German Kamerun. In this unit, he served with valor, rising through the ranks to become one of its top officers, and despite France’s loss in the Weltkrieg, N’Tchoréré returned home a hero. Begrudgingly melding into the new German-dominated administration, N’Tchoréré and his people chafed under the rule of Mittelafrika for decades until the Collapse freed all of Gabon. Now, with the madman M’ba deposed by N’Tchoréré’s hand, Gabon has been saved. Seeking no power or lofty position, Maréchal Charles N’Tchoréré has pledged to step down once elections are fully prepared, ensuring that free and fair democracy for all within Gabon becomes a reality, and not just the dream of an oppressed peoples."
POLITICS_SOUSATTE_DESC:0 "Hailing from a small Ghisira village and born in 1913 into the Bwiti faith, René-Paul Sousatte rose from these humble beginnings to be the newest Prime Minister of Gabon. Educated in Catholic school as child and mentored by Father Bichet, the King of Nkomi, Sousatte became a devout Catholic while still staying attuned to the syncretic Bwiti faith. Joining the priesthood after graduation, he met his now close friend and ally Aubame. Alongside Aubame, Sousatte joined the colonial civil service and began to both pick up the republican and anti-Imperialist views of his colleagues, while also adopting Socialist leanings through exposure to literature that had been smuggled into Gabon from the Commune of France. Rising through the ranks of the colonial regime and with the Collapse of Mittelafrika, Gabon was suddenly thrust into independence, and in this new political atmosphere Sousatte found himself among the inner-circle of founding fathers of the nation. Following the successful coup against M’ba, the republic was declared and now Sousatte stands as the most powerful man in the nation. Under his watch, Gabon shall purify democracy while retaining its piety and championing agrarian Afro-Socialism."
POLITICS_AUBAME_DESC:0 "Raised by the stepbrother of the tyrant M’ba and born into the Fang culture in 1912, Jean-Hilaire Aubame has been one of the most prominent independence figures in Gabon, and since the Collapse, he has cemented himself as one of Gabon’s founding fathers. Hailing from Leopildville, Aubame was orphaned at a young age, and turned to his adoptive caretaker and the Catholic Church for solace. Bouncing around multiple Catholic missions before graduating, his once-ally M’ba helped him get a customs job upon graduation. As Mittelafrika fell, he worked with M’ba until they broke over disagreements on faith and with Aubame declaring his old friend a traitor over M’ba’s authoritarianism. Now in charge of the nation after Maréchal N’Tchoréré’s coup and after fair and free elections, Prime Minister Aubame seeks to guide Gabon and his fellow equatorial Africans into a pious, populist, and uniquely African future."
POLITICS_MBA_SOCCON_DESC:0 "A proud man of the Fang that lived within the heart of Libreville, Gabriel Léon M’ba has been close to the colonials for life. Born in 1902 to a powerful Évolue family in the capital, M’ba studied at a Catholic seminary but never left the Bwiti faith. Upon graduation he moved from job to job, being a lumberjack, a merchant, and a store manager before he began work as a customs agent within the colonial administration. An avowed independence activist since adolescence, his fiery rhetoric only intensified as the Weltkrieg ended and the patchwork of Mittelafrika was raised, but his intelligence and usefulness kept him employed within the colonial regime. Chosen by both his peers and by the German administration to become the canton chief of Libreville’s large Fang neighborhood upon the passing of the previous chief, M’ba used his new position to build a strong support base while confiding in a close inner-circle of fellow Libreville intellectuals. Eschewing conservative traditions and going against the pleas of the tribal elders, M’ba paved his own path and gained a reputation as being an able-minded and confident leader, which would propel him to prominence. With Gabon freed of colonialism during the great Collapse, M’ba saw his opportunity to fortune and power, sidestepping his rivals to become the first Prime Minister of an independent Gabon. Known for his desire for wealth, his unwavering bias to his own people, and a self-avowed Francophiliac, Prime Minister M’ba is the father of our new republic. Now only time will tell if he holds true to his loose promises of real democracy, or shall Gabon simply become his new playground."
POLITICS_MBA_PATAUT_DESC:0 "Surviving the coup attempt against his regime, Léon M’ba has thrown off his mask, tearing down the facade of true republicanism that had wrapped the infantile Gabonese state. Shedding his title of Prime Minister and declaring himself as the eternal ‘Hyperprésident’, M’ba has brought mask-off kleptocratic one-party rule to Gabon. Now standing as Hyperprésident-for-life, M’ba has all of Gabon and beyond in the palm of his hand. Aspiring to unite all of Equatorial Africa under his domain. A massive sycophant to the French both in Algiers and in Paris, M’ba has openly stated many times that he truly only wishes to rule to make both himself and his fellow Fang rich and prosperous, as well as his French allies. However, along the way, he has freed much of Africa from the raptures of old colonialism and violent tribalism, uniting many disparate peoples and enforcing stability along the way with his infamous ‘Hyperpurge.’ Standing as one of the titans of this new post-Collapse Africa, Hyperprésident M’ba has transformed this Dark Continent and brought at least part of it into a new light."
POLITICS_GONDJOUT_DESC:0 "Paul Marie Indjendjet Gondjout seeks to bring French-inspired liberalism and fair social capitalism to the peoples of Gabon and Equatorial Africa after becoming Prime Minister in the wake of Maréchal N’Tchoréré’s coup against ‘Hyperprésident’ M’ba. Born in 1912 into an affluent Mpongwe family, Prime Minister Gondjout followed his older brother into the colonial service in the wake of Germany’s seizure of Gabon after the Weltkrieg. Secularly educated and raised by and around privileged Évolues, Gondjout was well-poised to become one of Gabon’s founding fathers, for not only was he born into an advantageous position, but he and a young Aubame and M’ba worked together in the colonial service. With the Collapse, and with M’ba’s tyranny undone, Gondjout shall bring a true Western and purely Capitalist way of life to his people."

GAB_fall_of_the_iron_cross_desc:0 "The Iron Cross that once stretched across the dark expanse of this massive continent has finally fallen - and with it the last shred of stability and peace left in Africa has gone along with it. We are a sea of Frenchmen and Africans lost amidst a sea of Krauts and chaos. We must tread carefully as we seek to establish our sovereignty here on the Equatorial Coast."

GAB_kick_out_the_congo:0 "Kick out the Kongo"
GAB_kick_out_the_congo_desc:0 "The Manikongo to the south has invaded our borders, serving as ominous and ravenous heralds to the utter apocalypse that has reached Africa with the collapse of the German goliath. We must repel these savage tribesmen at all costs, for if we wait too long, their friends in Portugal might send aid!"

GAB_open_recruitment:0 "Lower Our Recruitment Standards"
GAB_open_recruitment_desc:0 "If we are to drive back the Manikongo’s forces and preserve our newfound independence, we will need men to fill the ranks of our newly raised regiments. Historically, the defense force of our mighty colony has been selective with its troop intake, but the time for caution and strict standards is dead and gone. Now is the time for action as we fight for our survival!"

GAB_borrow_french_guns:0 "Requisition Guns from the French"
GAB_borrow_french_guns_desc:0 "With the fall of colonial rule, our access to the wider German economy has been cut off, and with it, we have also lost our easy access to new equipment. While raiding old caches and weapon-stores may be enough to outfit a few divisions, we will need a steady supply of firearms if we are to beat back the Kongo monarchists. We must make overtures to the Algerian Regime in order to sequester new weapons of war as we fight for our survival."

GAB_conscript_askari:0 "Conscript the Askari"
GAB_conscript_askari_desc:0 "The Askari that were once loyal to the Germans now find themselves with no benefactors nor allies in the wake of Mittelafrika’s demise. Though French colonial regimes rarely relied on these native mercenaries, now is not the time to be picky. We shall reach out to these aimless veterans and offer them a new deal - fight for the Gabonese army as our elite and specialized infantry force, or lose all benefits and rewards being an Askari once granted. Surely waving their pensions and right to vote in their faces will get them to jump to action!"

GAB_gabriels_cabal:0 "Gabriel's Cabal"
GAB_gabriels_cabal_desc:0 "Gabriel Léon M’ba rules as the first ‘president’ of an independent Gabon, though his regime already shows the tell tale signs of undemocratic practices and wider ambitions that lay outside the regular purview of a normal democracy’s limits on power. For M’ba, being president is not to better his fellow Gabonese, but to enrich himself and his associates as they run Gabon as their personal playground. Under this cabal, Gabon shall bend to the will of its first, and possibly last, president."

GAB_penal_labour:0 "Toil for the President"
GAB_penal_labour_desc:0 "President M’Ba has a long history of co-opting his followers and constituents to bend to his will, both mentally and physically. Implementing strategies and ideas he perfected during his time as ‘chef de canton’ of Libreville’s largest Fang burrough, M’ba shall finally have the workforce he desperately needs to build up Gabon’s fledgling economy. No one may deny the call to work from our President!"

GAB_reverse_apartheid:0 "Independence at Any Cost"
GAB_reverse_apartheid_desc:0 "President M’Ba, though a rabid Francophile, still seeks to establish Gabon as an independent and self-sufficient nation, free of any colonist aide or influence. To do this, Gabon shall be transformed into a beacon of autarky, and anyone that disagrees with these new edicts shall be dealt with accordingly. The assets of the remaining Huns will be seized, the press and civil liberties will be restricted, and any remaining colonialist holdouts resistant to our regime will be forced to work for our regime or face our wrath. Gabon needs no other!"

GAB_foreign_labour:0 "Accept Harsh Realities"
GAB_foreign_labour_desc:0 "President M’ba has seen the writing on the wall - Gabon is a fragile and fledgling nation on a continent of chaos, and will need help if it is to survive. Though he will still go to great lengths to curtail any and all chances at internal dissent, he shall do so with a lighter hand to save face with his new partners as he plays nice with the French government in order to secure the necessary funding and aid Gabon needs to survive. Gabon may not need others, but their help shall certainly be taken when we can get it so easily."

GAB_fang_supremacy:0 "Fang Supremacy"
GAB_fang_supremacy_desc:0 "Belonging to the wider Ekang subgroup of the Bantu people, the Fang are a some of the most numerous of the varied peoples of East-Central Africa, with their numbers spreading across Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Kamerun. Their dominance shall continue not only in number but through state policy as well, for President M’Ba, a Fang man himself, has begun to increasingly favor his native people in all matters of state policy. Ideas of Fang suprematism and Bantu extremism have begun to takehold through Gabon, and M’ba does not seem to show any signs of stopping it."

GAB_bwati_national_religion:0 "Embrace the Bwiti Faith"
GAB_bwati_national_religion_desc:0 "With the arrival of the French colonizers, Christianity quickly replaced Biere as the dominant religion of the various Gabonese people. With the return of native rule, interest in our native roots has exploded, with Biere also becoming incredibly popular again. However, more interesting has been the explosion in popularity of the syncretic Bwiti faith, a fusion of Christianity and Biere beliefs mixed with the ceremonial usage of psychedelics on specific holidays. With President M’ba, member of the Fang people who first practiced this new religion, even taking part in some of its beliefs and rituals, perhaps the time has come to fully embrace Bwiti as a national faith."

GAB_return_to_french_rule:0 "A French ‘Constitution’"
GAB_return_to_french_rule_desc:0 "With the birth of this newly independent Gabonese ‘republic,’ a new constitution shall be needed for the nation, and what better system to emulate than the French. We have only witnessed firsthand how ineffectual the German system is, and with President M’Ba’s clear francophile sympathies already becoming apparent, the French system is the clear way to go for our people. Besides, our esteemed President can always make alterations to the document as needed. It is only a piece of paper after all."

GAB_join_entente:0 "Overtures to Old Allies"
GAB_join_entente_desc:0 "With our new government established and the foundations for President M’ba’s rule beginning to fully cement, it is time we established full contact with the rightful French regime who has long been Exiled to Algiers. The stench of syndialism shall not disgrace M’ba’s pure Gabon state, and the Entente and our old overlords shall be the perfect deterrent. We open our arms to our old allies!"

GAB_president_for_life:0 "L'Hyperprésident du Gabon"
GAB_president_for_life_desc:0 "Gabriel Léon M’ba has ruled over Gabon with an iron fist, but has always maintained an air of legitimacy and democracy. However, this all ends now as M’ba seeks to elevate himself past his current position as mere president. M’ba has higher aspirations in mind, and no small hurdles like voting or oppositional parties will stand in his way. M’ba shall rise to become the first ‘Hyperprésident du Gabon’ - a dictator in all but name, giving him the power to do as he pleased fully and totally for life."

GAB_paranoia_of_man:0 "The Paranoia of Man"
GAB_paranoia_of_man_desc:0 "Hyperprésident M’ba has narrowly survived the military coup aimed at ousting him from power, and with their failure, the dreams of a democratic Gabon die with them. Now the nation will know just how far their Hyperprésident is willing to go, for the paranoia has begun to fester within the mind of their great leader. M’ba will not rest until Gabon is safe and secure, for nothing will stand in the way of his insatiable lust for total dominance."

GAB_purge_the_military:0 "Cull the Traitors"
GAB_purge_the_military_desc:0 "The instrument of the failed coup was our military - long dominated by German sympathizers and democratic rabble. The entire Gabonese military shall be cleansed from the bottom-up,  with no traitor left standing nor any weakling left to sully our good name. Our military shall be forged to be as resolute and as dedicated to our survival as the Hyperprésident himself!"

GAB_blame_the_huns:0 "An Easy Scapegoat"
GAB_blame_the_huns_desc:0 "It was the Huns! Every single poor decision our administration has made, every misstep we have taken, every problem that ails our state, and ever mallady that plagues our people has been caused by these vile and incompetant Germans. Their colonial monstrosity is what oppressed us for so long and its collapse is what has thrown our very way of life into absolute chaos. Blame it all on the Huns, and let the people take their frustrations on the true culprit behind their woes!"

GAB_who_the_hell_needs_democracy:0 "Who the Hell Needs Democracy?"
GAB_who_the_hell_needs_democracy_desc:0 "Our glorious Hyperprésident has evolved past the need for democracy. The voice of the people only clouds his near-divine judgement while their incessant need for attention and direction only serves as a distraction to M’ba’s ambitious vision. The last semblances of democracy shall be cast off from Gabon, for the only opinion and word that matters now is the word of M’ba."

GAB_greater_kleptocracy:0 "What About Greater Kleptocracy?"
GAB_greater_kleptocracy_desc:0 "It has been no secret that from the very beginning of his entrance to politics, Gabriel M’ba has thirsted for self-satisfaction and profit above all else. He has openly declared at many a state function and gathering that he merely entered the political arena to make himself rich while pleasing his esteemed Évolué family. Now as Hyperprésident of this new Gabonese state, nothing can stand in his way as he turns the nation into a true and pure kleptocracy - one that entirely benefits himself above all others. Gabon shall be M’ba’s private playground as he endeavors to become the richest man in all of Africa!"

GAB_sucsesful_coup:0 "The Folly of Man"
GAB_sucsesful_coup_desc:0 "With his French benefactors leaving him to the wolves, President M’ba’s authoritarian kleptocracy has collapsed under the pressure of the Gabonese Defense and Security Forces. Now, under the protection of our military, true democracy shall be brought to the Gabonese people - a right stolen from them by the villainous M’ba."

GAB_rebuild_democratic_institutions:0 "Rebuild Democratic Institutions"
GAB_rebuild_democratic_institutions_desc:0 "The deposed ‘Hyperprésident’ M’ba suffocated and quashed virtually every institution, system, or check within our government that could be even thinly labeled ‘democratic.’ Under his rule, the Bloc Démocratique Gabonais became the sole party of our dying republic as M’ba transformed Gabon into a single-party kleptocracy fueled entirely by the Hyperprésident’s greed and ambition. We must weave true democratic ideals and practices back into the fabric of our nation lest the country unravel entirely."

GAB_reverse_the_madmans_policies:0 "Reverse the Madman's Policies"
GAB_reverse_the_madmans_policies_desc:0 "M’ba the madman has been deposed, but many of his vile policies remain. Ideas of Fang supremacism must be contained and suppressed while the other religions must be brought back as nationally accepted faiths to further foster unity in our fractured people. Press freedoms will return, and all further criticisms can be voiced against the legislation of the M’ba regime. We shall tear down his twisted legacy page by page until Gabon is finally free!"

GAB_aubuames_conservatives:0 "Aubame's UDSG"
GAB_aubuames_conservatives_desc:0 "In the first fair elections free from the tampering of the fallen Hyperprésident, Jean-Hilaire Aubame and his Union Démocratique et Sociale Gabonaise have taken hold of the nation. Once M’ba’s largest rival and critic before the creation of his one party state under the BDG, Aubame now leads a coalition of the remaining true conservatives left untainted by M’ba working with a slew of socially liberal, anti-socialist reformers. Taking inspiration from Louis Marin and the Fédération Républicaine and fusing it with our president’s own socially liberal, economically conservative ideas and faith, Aubame and the UDSG shall build Gabon up as a bastion of true Social-Christian republicanism."

GAB_crush_colonial_corruption:0 "Crush Colonial Corruption"
GAB_crush_colonial_corruption_desc:0 "With the German colonial apparatus dead, the M’ba regime overthrown, and the French colonialists largely outnumbered, we can finally take on the herculean task of quashing corruption within our republic once and for all. For too long have politicians, civil servants, military officials, and imperialists let their greed and ambitions run rampant within our borders. The Gabonese Republic will be cleansed of this sin."

GAB_tatical_investment:0 "Gabonese Civic Nationalism"
GAB_tatical_investment_desc:0 "In order to create a truly strong and united democratic atmosphere, we must actively work to include as many within our borders as possible. Gabon is land of various and distinct Bantu tribes, from the Estuaire and the Ogooué groups to the Nyanga and Woleu Ntem. These myriad ethnic bands, along with our minority Pygmy population, must all band together under ideas we can all share and have pride in. Our rights, our liberties, our shared cultures and identity as the Gabonese people shall unite us like no mere racially-motivated nationalism could. We are Gabonese, one and all!"

GAB_church_voulenteership:0 "Utilize the Church"
GAB_church_voulenteership_desc:0 "With the French came Catholicism, and despite M’ba’s attempts to snuff out pure Christian beliefs with his syncretic ideas, Catholicism still dominates the people of Gabon. We too are true sons and daughters of God, and as such, the Catholic Church has long been allowed to operate within our borders. Henceforth, we shall actively support the Church so that we may use it as a tool to strengthen this democratic republic we are creating."

GAB_church_tax_exemptions:0 "Social Catholicism"
GAB_church_tax_exemptions_desc:0 "The three pillars of a just and righteous society are human dignity, solidarity, and subsidiarity. These guiding principles shall form the cornerstone of our pious new democracy, as we endeavor to both respect the rights and abilities of our people. The Lord is our Saviour, and we are His children - may His doctrine guide us as we strive to create a fair and just society that knows limits and good Christian morals."

GAB_in_god_we_trust:0 "Dieu et la Liberté"
GAB_in_god_we_trust_desc:0 "Under President Aubame, Gabon has been transformed into a stable and moral democratic haven here on the Dark Continent. Utilizing ideas from the French colonizers’ more enlightened and ethical thinkers and fusing them with our own unique Gabonese spirit, we have created a pious, steadfast, and resilient republic that no longer bears the dark mark of the M’ba regime or the Kaiser’s greed. Gabon is free and safe at last, under God."

GAB_gondouts_liberals:0 "Gondjout’s PDG"
GAB_gondouts_liberals_desc:0 "In the first fair elections free from the tampering of the fallen Hyperprésident, Paul Marie Indjendjet Gondjout and his Parti Démocratique Gabonais have taken back their seats as the rightful rules of the nation as they strip their party of any and all traces of the Hyperprésident’s regime. Once the leader of the centre-right BDG before M’ba seized power and stole party leadership from him, Gondjout now leads a coalition of liberal economists, Secular conservatives, and Pro-Westernization groups left untainted by M’ba. Taking inspiration from the Alliance Démocratique and from theorists such as Paul Reynaud and Pierre Étienne-Flandin and fusing it with his own beliefs, our new President and the PDG shall build Gabon up as a true embodiment of pluralistic and profitable democracy."

GAB_western_investment:0 "French-Inspired Liberalism"
GAB_western_investment_desc:0 "Our republic shares the same roots and lineage of the heroes of the French Revolution, the great Enlightenment thinkers, and the titans of French Liberalism from Montesquieu and Constant to de Staël and Reynaud. Ideas such as the separation of powers, inherent civil rights and liberties, true democratic republicanism, capitalist enterprise, and so much more form the foundation of our Republic’s very existence. This legacy shall become the foundation of our new government as we work to bring true liberty to the Gabonese people."

GAB_westernization_first:0 "Westernization First"
GAB_westernization_first_desc:0 "Though it may be hard to accept for many within our nation, we need the West and their modern ideas if we are to survive in the world order they have created. Westernization and modernization must be top priorities of the state, for if we fall behind any farther, our opportunistic neighbors or foreign imperialists will come knocking once more."

GAB_satisfy_basic_needs:0 "Meeting the Needs of the People"
GAB_satisfy_basic_needs_desc:0 "It is the basic goal of a government to provide the basic needs of its people, but the M’ba regime and the colonialist establishments of the past both failed to do even this most basic and fundamental task - this must change. Our citizens, as rightful members of this Gabonese Republic, have certain inalienable rights that the state must protect and deliver upon. It is time we had a government that truly cared for and respected its people and we can provide for them without giving falling to radicalism and giving into deceit like the silver-tongued leftists that seek to undermine our rule."

GAB_tip_from_kenyesianism:0 "A Tip from Keynesianism"
GAB_tip_from_kenyesianism_desc:0 "Despite being a member of the ever-scheming Anglos, John Maynard Keynes has been making a splash in the wider international scene as a brilliant and near-clairvoyant economic theorist. His ideas, an evolution of the laissez-faire mindset that had taken hold of Britain before the revolution and the wider world since, is based on free market principles, social welfare systems, and anti-austerity stances, among a slew of other novel ideas. We should take a note from Keynes as we develop our new modern economy."

GAB_free_market:0 "Union, Travail, Justice"
GAB_free_market_desc:0 "Under President Gondjout, Gabon has been transformed from an underdeveloped, humanitarian nightmare into steadily growing economic paradise where profit and liberty are paramount virtues. This secular, shining republic has fully washed clean the decay and toxic residue left over from the M’ba regime and the Krauts, and the people of Gabon rejoice for it. Liberty rings across our union, for working together towards prosperity and profit has brought true justice and freedom to the Gabonese people."

GAB_entente_question:0 "Old ‘Friends’ or New Horizons?"
GAB_entente_question_desc:0 "Well before the Iron Cross of the Kaiserreich rose over Africa, the French ruled these lands we call home, and all the while we lived under their rule, their culture melded with ours and became part of who we are. When the Hun fell, Hyperprésident M’ba one more reached out to the French to make overtures, and in doing so, secured their aid. Now, M’ba is gone and we rule Gabon, so we must make a choice: stay aligned with our former overlords and the regime that backed a destructive madman, or find our own way?"

GAB_pierres_socialists:0 "Sousatte's PUNGA"
GAB_pierres_socialists_desc:0 "In the first fair elections free from the tampering of the fallen Hyperprésident, René-Paul Sousatte and his Parti de l'Unité Nationale Gabonaise have won a surprise victory over the more moderate candidates, and now seeks to put Gabon on the road to Socialism. Heavily influenced by Marceau Pivert and his radical Parti Socialiste Ouvrier et Paysan, Sousatte shall bring the red beacon of Syndicalism and Socialism here to Gabon, but heavily altered to fit the realities of our underdeveloped nation and with a unwavering dedication to true democracy. The Gabon proletariat shall finally be free under President Sousatte as he welcomes the Red Tide to our shores."

GAB_break_the_colonial_shackles:0 "Break the Shackles of Colonialism"
GAB_break_the_colonial_shackles_desc:0 "With the victory of President Sousatte and the PUNGA, one of the state’s most pressing concerns has been to crush the last vestiges of colonialism influence within the nation, namely from the previous German and imperialist French regimes. Many of our institutions and systems still bear the marks and scars of colonialist greed and imperial inequalities. The last of these traces must be eradicated and replaced with more equitable and fair institutions that are capable of accurately providing for our people with the allure of corruption and personal gain getting in the way. The Gabonese people are free, it is time we started living like it."

GAB_true_agrarianism:0 "Afro-Syndicalist Agrarianism"
GAB_true_agrarianism_desc:0 "Though we are inspired by the successes of the Commune in Paris and their progress towards benefiting mankind, many of their policies would not work in a nation in our current state. Their emphasis on industrialization and urbanization shall be dialed back and replaced with emphasis on mechanized agriculture as we bend their ideas and fuse them with our own to create a new, uniquely African solution to our situation. Agrarianism shall be embraced fully with a focus on animal husbandry more so over large scale crop-farming as we slowly build up small amounts of modern industry, particularly in manganese mining and timber harvesting, in the background. This will allow us to craft a new, worker-orientated economy where the realities of our situation and the needs of the people are both taken into account."

GAB_voluntary_collectives:0 "Voluntary Collectives"
GAB_voluntary_collectives_desc:0 "Democracy is sacred, and our people have their inherent rights that we can not infringe upon. However, our regime still thinks that collectivization of at least some sectors, particular within our agricultural departments, would do wonders to both our economy and our population’s sense of freedom and agency. To this end, a completely voluntary system of collectivization shall begin, with those that participate receiving generous benefits from the state to incentivize more volunteers. Gabon’s agricultural sector, at least in part, will no longer be dominated by wage-slavers and workplace bureaucracy."

GAB_disband_askari:0 "A Red Militia"
GAB_disband_askari_desc:0 "Despite whatever reforms we shall undertake to transform the Gabonese armed forces into a formidable and reliable fighting force, a more localized force could prove to be extremely useful in the event of another military or foreign-backed coup like we all witnessed during the M’ba regime. A Red militia should be formed, taking volunteers from collectives and cooperatives throughout the nation, to serve as the last line of defense between Gabon and utter chaos if hard times should ever reach us again. These dedicated, loyal, and fervent supporters of our regime shall serve Gabon proudly!"

GAB_african_comrades:0 "Socialist Democracy and Comradery"
GAB_african_comrades_desc:0 "We have achieved the mandate of our rule democratically, and we will respect that mandate no matter our goals or ambitions. Democracy must be maintained at all costs, even if the people’s mandate changes hands and we are voted out, no matter how righteous and true our egalitarian cause may be. To ensure that we are reelected for terms to come to continue on our Socialist endeavor, we must earn the people’s trust and adoration while also building a combined sense of unity both within our own nation and with our African neighbors - regardless of their positions. Only together can Gabon and all of Africa be free."

GAB_red_africanism:0 "Red Africanism"
GAB_red_africanism_desc:0 "The Continent of Africa is vast, and much of our fellow Africans have yet to embrace or even think about the prospects of Socialism. We must be the heralds of this great awakening, for Socialism is the saviour they need but do not know it. We shall ride into this Red Dawn with the rest of our brothers and sisters in tow, for the Age of Imperialism is over, and the Age of Red Africa has only just begun..."

GAB_contact_the_real_france:0 "L'Internationale Sera le Genre Africain"
GAB_contact_the_real_france_desc:0 "Our Socialist foundation has been established under the wise and fair rule of President Sousatte, and now it is time to showcase our progress to the wider world. The Internationale, led by the rightful French government, is half a world away, and yet, they are our best hope at salvation. We shall reach out to their government, not as a former colony but as equals, and discuss matters of reconciliation and cooperation. Workers of the world unite!"

GAB_intergrate_askari:0 "The Question of the Askari"
GAB_intergrate_askari_desc:0 "As a former French colony, the concept of using Askari was foreign to us until the arrival of the Germans and the rise of Mittelafrika. With their rise, these favored Black soldiers of Mittelafrika, who were near slaves to their White masters who dangled basic decency in their faces as rewards, came to influence our military for both good and for ill. Under General Hans Schomburgk, they have continued to be a source of influence and annoyance despite their tiny size. Now, with our political situation stabilized, we must finally decide on what to do with these German-inspired soldiers: disband them or fully integrate them into our current armed forces’ structure?. "

GAB_officer_corps:0 "Establish a Proper Officer Corps"
GAB_officer_corps_desc:0 "With the Askari Question out of the way, we must now work to establish a true officer corp, both independent from politics and drilled in the finest of strategy and tactics. From the unruly rabble of our tribal forces to the pompous remnants of the French and German garrisons, all of our forces shall fall in line behind the new class of Gabonese officers."

GAB_first_squadron:0 "The First Squadron"
GAB_first_squadron_desc:0 "We must take flight! If we are to come out victoriously against any future foe, we will need airpower to do it. The last conflicts we fought have been internal squabbles or conflict with tribal kingdoms and ragtag, undersupplied, and isolated Germans. We will not be so lucky again, and so in the next war we won’t have to just rely on foot soldiers and guns, for now our soldiers will have their own eyes in the skies over Africa. The First Gabonese Squadron shall be the first of many!"

GAB_liberville_international:0 "Construct Libreville International"
GAB_liberville_international_desc:0 "In order to house and supply the airfleet we have so desperately strived for, we are going to need to build a modern airport unlike the people of Gabon have ever seen. Near the capital, just outside Libreville, we shall construct a large and (relatively) state of the art aerodrome, while also simultaneously launching a program to upgrade and renovate the few standing airstrips we have left from the colonial regime. We need the infrastructure on the ground before we can reliably take to the air."

GAB_experiment_with_french_designs:0 "Experiment with French Designs"
GAB_experiment_with_french_designs_desc:0 "The French, our original masters, have long innovated and experimented with aeronautical technologies. With our long-established ties, acquiring some of their more dated designs on the cheap could aid our research and development efforts tremendously. We shall purchase some of these models so that our engineers and scientists can begin a dedicated aeronautical research department of our own."

GAB_import_french_designs:0 "Import French Weapons..."
GAB_import_french_designs_desc:0 "The French have long been famous for making some innovative and bold design choices when it comes to weapons design, but overall, they make some fine weapons of war. Even if their equipment isn’t what it's all cracked up to be, their worst firearms are still miles better than anything we can reliably make for ourselves here outside of a select few gunsmiths in the capital. Using our established ties and trade links, we must purchase as many functional French firearms and artillery pieces as possible, no matter their age."

GAB_to_make_them_ourselves:0 "...To Make Them Ourselves"
GAB_to_make_them_ourselves_desc:0 "We have recently come into a large store of aged French weapons of war, ranging from pieces made in the years following the Weltkrieg to practical antiques. Whatever our troops can’t use in combat can be turned into scrap for future production or taken apart by our engineers to further our understanding of large-scale domestic weapon-smithing. We will make sure every rifle, handgun, and cannon is used in some way, for Gabon needs all the arms it can muster if we are to survive this continent of chaos."

GAB_bush_warfare:0 "Bush Warfare"
GAB_bush_warfare_desc:0 "Africa is a harsh continent, with varied climates and terrains that stretch across its expansive mass. In Gabon and the surrounding areas, savannahs dominate the landscape with dense pockets of monsoon forest that border the North and South. These wild lands are known to our people, and thus our soldiers, just as well as they know how to breathe or run. We shall use this knowledge to form the basis of our new military doctrine. We shall become masters of the Bush itself."

GAB_guerilla_art:0 "Perfect the Art of Guerilla Warfare"
GAB_guerilla_art_desc:0 "With their deep knowledge of the local terrain and with the new tactics we have developed instilled deeply in their hearts and minds, the Gabonese Defense and Security Forces have evolved into a fierce and ravenous fighting force. Each day, our militias raise from their volunteer’s barracks and drill the skills needed to defend our lands from any invader. With each drop of blood and sweat spilled, these Gabonese guerillas get one step closer to being the most feared fighting force in all of Central Africa!"

GAB_trainers_from_abroad:0 "The French Attachė"
GAB_trainers_from_abroad_desc:0 "The French have always aided in our development, and now is the time to ask them for their aid in our attempts at military development as well. We need to be able to defend ourselves in the face of the various threats that face us on this dangerous continent, and without their help, we would sooner be devoured by the predators that stalk us in the dark. Send a delegation the French; Gabon calls for aid!"

GAB_village_militias:0 "Militarize Rural Villages"
GAB_village_militias_desc:0 "The various villages, tribal kingdoms, and other small settlements that lie outside the major cities and across the countryside are a valuable and untapped asset we could utilize for our military’s gain. By offering incentives to volunteers from these population centers to join organized levees and militias, we could train the regular citizens of Gabon to be able to rise up at a moments notice. By spreading this system across the entire nation, Gabon could have an army of thousands ready to protect their nation at a moment’s notice. Every inch of Gabon shall become the frontline as every volunteer rises, rifle in hand, to defend their home."

GAB_jungle_firebombing:0 "Napalm’s Aroma"
GAB_jungle_firebombing_desc:0 "You smell that? That’s napalm, and nothing else smells like it in the world. Requisitioned from our French friends to the North, we have been able to quietly purchase and import tons of this vitriolic compound for use against any foe foolish or daring enough to step foot past our borders without our approval. They can not run, and they can not hide, for we shall burn the jungles they scurry away too like the vermin they are as we turn the very sky red with our ordinance."

GAB_napalm:0 "Turn Our Foes to Ash"
GAB_napalm_desc:0 "Though we know our land well, the forces we will be fighting will also be used to the rough and rugged terrain of our region unless some foolish Europeans try to land on our shores like all those centuries ago. To combat this, we can simply remove the advantage the terrain may give them. With enough cannons and firebombs, even the deepest thicket can be cleared, along with any enemy troops hiding among the trees. We will turn the land to cinders and our foes to ash if we have to in order to protect our sovereignty. The trees will regrow, our enemies will not."

GAB_howitzers_for_every_regiment:0 "Tear the Skies Down Upon Them"
GAB_howitzers_for_every_regiment_desc:0 "With our newly defined doctrine and quietly acquired weapons of devastating destruction, we have the weapons of war within our hands necessary to defend Gabon at all costs. If any foe dares to try and sully our sense of sovereignty or tries to stifle our ambition, we shall unleash hell upon them. Shell by shell and bomb by bomb, we will tear apart the sky and send the very heavens crashing down upon the heads of our enemies, for nothing and no one will stop the Gabonese war machine."

GAB_stall_the_post_colonial_shock:0 "Stall the Post Colonial Shock"
GAB_stall_the_post_colonial_shock_desc:0 "Drastic measures and quick action are what's needed to jumpstart our fledgling economy. We must delay the inevitable tremors from the collapse of colonial rule that will ravage this upstart economic system so that our financial future does not die before it can even begin."

GAB_fund_water_and_power_grids:0 "Nationalized Water and Power"
GAB_fund_water_and_power_grids_desc:0 "To quickly establish the needed basic infrastructure needed to build modern settlements and cities, we will need a system that can quickly and easily allocate funds and dictate demands without waiting for private business to build up or mess up. For now, Water and Power grids within Gabon will be run by the state until a time where some privatization can occur without causing destabilization."

GAB_invest_in_timber_industries:0 "Invest in the Timber Industry"
GAB_invest_in_timber_industries_desc:0 "One of our largest exports is lumber and timber, especially from the local hardwoods that grow in our native monsoon forests. We should capitalize on this readily-available source of easy income by heavily investing in our local woodcutting industry so that it can grow to become a truly profitable aspect of our economy."

GAB_textile_mills:0 "Gabonese Textiles"
GAB_textile_mills_desc:0 "Textile milling was some of the first industries to reach our shores, with much of our earliest laborers and now female industrial workers finding themselves working in looms across the nation. Bringing with them the skills and eye for design that they learned in their native cultures, particularly among the famously talented weavers of Libreville, textiles shall grow to become a major export of our economy while also providing ample uses for our own people."

GAB_offshore_oil:0 "Capitalise on Offshore Oil"
GAB_offshore_oil_desc:0 "Due to Germany’s desperation for more oil reserves, they have long spent time and money surveying their colonial holdings for oil. Before the collapse, a German survey team discovered hints that oil deposits may lie just off the Western coast of our nation. If we could seize this opportunity to have our very own oil industry, Gabon could see wealth beyond its wildest dreams as the world’s demand for Black Gold only continues to rise. Sure, it will be expensive and dangerous to tap our own oil while so inexperienced and underprepared, but our economy needs a jumpstart now!"

GAB_pump_the_oil_boom:0 "Further Fuel the Oil Boom"
GAB_pump_the_oil_boom_desc:0 "With the oil fields off our coast now tapped, we must entice the world powers to join in on the Gabonese oil craze. Though it has its uses, we have tapped far more oil than we can currently consume, and to make any sort of net gain after all the funds we dumped into getting the operation started, we will have to sell this prized liquid on the international market. Though the big leagues may be brutal and unforgiving, it is where we are also likely to make the quickest and heftiest profit."

GAB_early_rural_mechinazation:0 "The Beginnings of Rural Mechanization"
GAB_early_rural_mechinazation_desc:0 "Much of our population still lives within a rural environment, far from the hustle and bustle of Libreville or Port Gentil. We should begin to implement mechanization efforts in these rural communities to increase their working efficiency while also improving their standard of living as our young nation strives towards modernity."

GAB_the_trans_gabon_railway:0 "L’Transgabonais"
GAB_the_trans_gabon_railway_desc:0 "A rail system for Gabon was first planned as far back as 1885, but until now, virtually no rail or track existed within Gabon. To rectify this, our administration has begun to gather the necessary funds and contracts to create the Trans-Gabon Railway, or L’Transgabonais, to eventually connect the major cities of Libreville and Franceville on opposing ends of the nation. With stops along the way being constructed first in a few other stand-out locations like Abanga and Booué, we shall link our people together with iron and steel."

GAB_extend_to_makokou:0 "Extend the Line to Makokou"
GAB_extend_to_makokou_desc:0 "With the initial stages of L’Transgabonais being a relative success, we have decided to lay new track down towards the Northern city of Makokou. Prized for its proximity to our only major iron deposits, this new line shall ferry both ore and people to and from one of the most important cities in the nation."

GAB_extend_to_moanda:0 "Extend the Line to Moanda"
GAB_extend_to_moanda_desc:0 "With the initial stages of L’Transgabonais being a relative success, we have decided to lay new track down towards the Southern city of Moanda. The city has long prospered and held importance due to its proximity to the largest manganese deposits in Gabon - one of our main exports. This new line shall ferry both ore and people to and from one of the most important cities in the nation."

GAB_rural_infrastructure:0 "Rural Infrastructure"
GAB_rural_infrastructure_desc:0 "To better connect our people, we must build new infrastructure across Gabon, taming its wilderness as we go. The Abanga swamp will be partially drained to allow for better rail travel while also opening up areas for development. Meanwhile, new roads shall be constructed wide with new bridges built to cross the mighty Ogooué, fifth largest river in all of Africa. We shall tame the wilds of Gabon and connect our citizens, for even our most isolated people deserve access to the benefits of the state."

GAB_first_steps_to_industrialization:0 "First Steps to Industrialization"
GAB_first_steps_to_industrialization_desc:0 "Aside from our small but growing simple industries like mining, textiles, and timber harvesting, among others, Gabon largely lacks any meaningful levels of mass industrialization, and this becoming a reality anytime soon is pure fantasy. However, we can take the first steps towards this larger goal of an industrialized Gabon by funding the creation of a few local factories to begin producing goods vital to the state and our trade networks. We shall take these first few steps as quickly as possible, for we are desperate to avoid the growing pains of a newly independent economy, but the future is brighter for our economy than it ever has been."

GAB_establish_financial_beuracracy:0 "Establish a Financial Bureaucracy"
GAB_establish_financial_beuracracy_desc:0 "We currently have no real widespread and unified financial system. What little we had that remained from the colonial regimes was obliterated in the chaos of the Mittelafrikan Collapse. The Gabonese financial bureaucracy will be built from the ground up as rapidly as possible in order to get the nation on the path to prosperity as quickly as possible, or at least keep us away from an economic meltdown."

GAB_gabonese_franc:0 "The Gabonese Franc"
GAB_gabonese_franc_desc:0 "Pegged to the French Franc and utilized in a monetary system of French design, the Gabonese Franc shall become the national currency of our state. No longer shall various local currencies, barter economics, nor the Mark keep our economy locked in an archaic past or latched to a failed economy."

GAB_international_regognition:0 "Seek International Recognition"
GAB_international_regognition_desc:0 "We must seek international recognition for our fledgling republic if we are ever to establish ourselves as a legitimate player on the world stage. Without the recognition of the major powers, our economy will languish as the wider global economy passes us by."

GAB_shake_hands_with_the_french_desc:0 "The French have been tied to our people and our nation for decades, and with Germany no longer dictating how our people should be ruled, we should reach out to the French to discuss trade deals and mutually beneficial relations."

GAB_anglo_deals:0 "Deals with the Anglos"
GAB_anglo_deals_desc:0 "We have decided to reach out to the Anglos, long a dominant player in Africa before the Revolution. Though they do not control most of the world anymore, they are still a prosperous and economically shrewd people. We must establish official trade ties with them at once."

GAB_atlantic_trade:0 "Trade Across the Atlantic"
GAB_atlantic_trade_desc:0 "With our cooperation established, we shall begin to ship goods back and forth with the Anglos over the high and stormy seas of the Atlantic. With their business fueling our growing economy, we are sure not to fail."

GAB_deals_with_the_hun:0 "Deals with the Hun"
GAB_deals_with_the_hun_desc:0 "Though their vile colonial monstrosity oppressed our people since the Weltkrieg, the German have proven to be adept at business when they are so enticed. Mittelafrika was doomed to fail, but our nation is not. They are the world hegemon for a reason, and cooperation with them would surely only raise the prosperity of our people, right?"

GAB_pragmatic_trade:0 "Pragmatic Trade"
GAB_pragmatic_trade_desc:0 "We have accepted harsh truths before, and nothing is more true right now than Germany is richer than we are. We have swallowed our pride and resentment and are now moving to establish trade ties with our former overlords and oppressors. This pragmatic move has earned the ire from many within our regime, but President [GAB.getleader] knows this is the way towards true prosperity."

GAB_slow_and_steady_wins_the_race:0 "Slow and Steady Wins the Race"
GAB_slow_and_steady_wins_the_race_desc:0 "Methodical thinking and a slow and steady pace must be the approach we go with as we build our new post-colonial economy from the ground up. Rushing too quickly into this process could leave us sorely lacking in the future compared to if we had just been more patient."

GAB_no_room_for_corruption:0 "No Room for Corruption"
GAB_no_room_for_corruption_desc:0 "Corruption is a putrid and corrosive force that has infected our state since before its inception, with the foul stench of self-serving interests wafting off the colonial regimes that preceded our regime. We shall purify Gabon of this infection, picking through every layer of society with a fine-toothed comb, for there is no room for corruption in a prosperous and profitable state."

GAB_stable_beuracracy:0 "A Stable Bureaucracy"
GAB_stable_beuracracy_desc:0 "We must take our time and build a competent and stable bureaucracy that will be able to carry on the needs of the state and its people as our newly independent nation is established. We can not rush into this, for this institution will form the bedrock of our government for the foreseeable future."

GAB_ratified_tax_rate:0 "Graduated Tax Rate"
GAB_ratified_tax_rate_desc:0 "We shall issue a scaled, tiered tax plan that is guaranteed to be as fair as possible to all of our citizens while still providing the necessary funds for the state to utilize as a supplement to our trade income. All Gabonese shall pay their fair share to build a better society together."

GAB_the_gabonese_franc:0 "The Gabonese Franc"

GAB_start_the_teritary_sector:0 "Start the Tertiary Sector"
GAB_start_the_teritary_sector_desc:0 "The tertiary, or service, sector of an economy is the final stage three-sector theory, encompassing the intangible goods that established economies can provide that simple manufacturing or extraction sectors can not. The creation of a service industry is the mark of a modern economy, so we shall begin to create a domestic service sector to provide the accoutrements of a modernized state."

GAB_refine_administration:0 "Refine the Administration"
GAB_refine_administration_desc:0 "Though our initial steps at building up our economy have gone well, they could always be better. We must comb over every inch of our administration and economic infrastructure and cull the wheat from the chaff. All the excess and unneeded fat and bloat will be trimmed away as we streamline and purify the regime. In its place, as needed, new adjustments and additions will be made, and like a fine-tuned engine, we will tweak our systems until they are perfect."

GAB_water_and_power_grids:0 "Privatize Water and Power Grids"
GAB_water_and_power_grids_desc:0 "Though the state can still control key industries, selling off much of the burden to private companies will allow our own enterprising citizens a chance to earn their own living while providing necessary services to our people.The competition this will spark between competing firms will do more for our economy than letting them languish under state control would do."

GAB_new_enterprise:0 "Encourage New Enterprise"
GAB_new_enterprise_desc:0 "We must foster a love for profit and the entrepreneurial spirit within our people to rouse them to participate in a unified and open economy like never before seen in our lands. Our people must be made to realize that they are free to operate business and make their livings as they wish, and we shall incentivize the more adventurous souls who wish to risk it all and start their own businesses and practices. The allure of free enterprise shall drive Gabon to greatness!"

GAB_connect_cities:0 "Connect Our Cities"
GAB_connect_cities_desc:0 "Our cities lie in distant corners and nooks of our nations, separated by vast distances of rough terrain.

Gabon must be united!"

GAB_agricultural_autarky:0 "Agricultural Autarky"
GAB_agricultural_autarky_desc:0 "Autarky is a contentious topic in our republic, with advocates and opponents to it on both sides of the aisle. However, agricultural autarky is one of the few areas many of our ministers can agree on, with most seeing agricultural self-sufficiency and independence as a necessity for our nation. If we can’t feed our own people, we should not be trying to sell food to others!"

GAB_reap_what_we_sow_desc:0 "Long has our state endeavored to slowly but surely build the Gabonese economy, and after a grueling and tense journey, it is time to cash in on our patience. Our economic policies, though at times painfully slow to show results, have finally begun to benefit the wider Gabonese nation. Prosperity has finally come knocking for our people, and we, as a strong and stable economic power on this otherwise chaotic continent, are finally able to answer the door."

GAB_invest_in_fledeling_buisness:0 "Invest in Fledgling Business"
GAB_invest_in_fledeling_buisness_desc:0 "Small businesses owned and operated by our own citizens shall form the backbone of our fledgling economy. Incentivizing our own populace to pick themselves up by their own bootstraps as they build their own fortunes and livelihoods shall be difficult at first, but once established, having our own domestic industry and commercial sector will be a great boon to our nation’s young financial system."

GAB_invite_foreign_companies:0 "Invite Foreign Companies"
GAB_invite_foreign_companies_desc:0 "Foreign investment will be key to building up our economy quickly while also establishing the long-term ties and partnerships needed to continue to fuel our economy’s growth for years to come.

GAB_state_bonds:0 "State Bonds"
GAB_state_bonds_desc:0 "By issuing a series of state bonds, we can try and get our populace to see the benefit and need for long-term development and financing plans.

GAB_outsorce_labour:0 "Outsource Labour"
GAB_outsorce_labour_desc:0 "Gabon has a labour crisis - an odd problem to have with a population of nearly a million souls - but it is the reality we find ourselves in. Educated and skilled workers are nearly non-existent within our borders. To jumpstart our own economy, we shall outsource our skilled labour needs to foreign contractors and technicians, largely from France, to come and help establish our labour base. These hired foreigners will handle the workload as they teach our populace the skills they will need to do these jobs on their own."

GAB_rescoursce_expiditons:0 "Recourse Expeditions"
GAB_rescoursce_expiditons_desc:0 "Africa is a resource rich treasure trove, filled with variable resources and useful materials, and Gabon is no different.

GAB_encourage_western_imports:0 "Encourage Western Imports"
GAB_encourage_western_imports_desc:0 "The West may be responsible for much of what ails our people, but they are also responsible for the small taste of modernity we have experienced. Across the sea in their far-off lands, their factories churn out endless goods and products aimed at making life easier or more enjoyable for their citizens while further advancing their economy’s towards greater heights of wealth and prosperity. We should tap into this market and import as many foreign goods as possible. From mechanized tractors to radios, Gabon will have a taste of the finer life!"

GAB_tourism:0 "Lay the Grounds for Tourism"
GAB_tourism_desc:0 "Our nation is a beautiful and varied land, with thick monsoon forests that cover the Northern and Southern fringes and sprawling savannahs that stretch across our interior. As an oasis of general stability here in Africa, we could offer the people of the world a front row seat to Africa’s beauties and wonders without forcing them to confront the harsh reality and atmosphere of chaos that surrounds much of the continent. Tourism income shall become a new cornerstone of the Gabonese economy."

GAB_protected_wildlife:0 "Protected Wildlife"
GAB_protected_wildlife_desc:0 "Our wildlife is sacred. From the smallest hyrax to the largest elephants, the animal and plant life that form this beautiful ecosystem we live in are just as vital and important to our nation and our people as iron or air.

Few on this earth are of such a stock, but Hyperprésident M’ba is one such titan among mere mortals. Sure, he may be called mad by lesser beings, but that is only because they fail to realise his genius. Under our esteemed Hyperprésident, Gabon shall march triumphantly towards true power and perfection, all for the Gabonese people, and for M’ba and his insatiable drive and bottomless coffers as well."

GAB_restoration_frankish_rule_desc:0 "Though we have wrested control of the reigns of our destiny from the vile grasp of the Kaiser and his demented ambitions, we are not fully done with the Europeans. Across the Rhine from our hated former oppressor stands France - the homeland of our former benevolent masters, now beset by Socialist dogs. We must reach out instead to the frightful government stationed in Algiers and invite their government back to our capital as liaisons and advisors. With their help, Gabon shall flourish and M’ba shall profit."

GAB_ties_dahoney_desc:0 "To the North lies another colonial breakaway still in the hold of French influence - the small, yet proud Kingdom of Dahomey. Led by the Ahosu, or king, and his civilian government, it would appear at first that the natives of Dahomey were in total control. Under the surface however, the Algiers regime pulls the strings, so it is a sure thing that we can trust this fellow newly independent ‘post-colonial’ state."

GAB_reclaim_french_congo_desc:0 "Across the savannahs of our interior and through the great thicket of jungles that line our outermost borders lies the lands of the French Congo, centered around the colonial metropolis of Brazzaville. Speaking the same colonially-imposed tongue that we do and sharing many genetic, linguistic, and cultural links to the people of our own lands, the French Congo is a natural target for possible expansion, and with the collapse of the German colonial order, seizing it shall be easier than ever."

However, with Mittelafrika’s fiery and violent demise, the vast lands of Kamerun have broken free of colonial oppression. However, their post-colonial government has led them astray, squandering their potential, corrupting their people, and oppressing our very kin. We shall put an end to these atrocities once and for all."

GAB_invite_french_settlers:0 "Entice French Settlement"
GAB_invite_french_settlers_desc:0 "Without the French, with their culture and expertise, and far more importantly their money, Gabon would be doomed. We must send overtures to Algiers, and to even Paris if we must (all in secret, of course) to entice as many Frenchmen to come to our lush tropical shores and settle down, planting their roots into our fertile soil.

gab.1.t:0 "The Birth of the Gabonese ‘Republic’"
gab.1.d:0 "With the fiery collapse of colonial rule, the people of Gabon are now cast adrift upon a sea of chaos that has now consumed the lands of the former Mittelafrikan patchwork. Long languishing under French and then German rule, Gabon now stands free for the first time since 1885, and much has changed since then. We are now thrust upon this modern world alone and unsure of our future, \nIn the years leading up to our independence, the tenacious upstart Gabriel Léon M’ba has risen through the ranks of the colonial hierarchy, becoming Prime Minister of the native subgovernment that operated under the joint German-French mission. Nowm with our sovereignty secured, M’ba has been sworn in as the first President of an independent Gabonese republic under his Bloc Démocratique Gabonais, and has already begun to cement his authority. A known conservative and kleptocrat who only entered politics to make himself wealthier, M’ba’s early rule as Prime Minister within the colonial government has already revealed his authoritarian slant, and many fear for our infantile ‘democracy.’ \n\nRegardless, as it currently stands, M’ba rules as President with a slim veil of democratic legitimacy and has already made mention of his desires to reach out to the ‘rightful’ French government in Algiers. The far more immediate threat is the war we have found ourselves in to fight for our independence. To the South, the Manikongo and his savage tribes wage war with our defense forces, seeking to conquer Gabon and use it as a staging ground for his conquest of the Congo. We must repel these tribal monarchists at once, while also being wary of the collapsing German goliath who still has friends in Kamerun and Tekeland. The Gabonese Republic has many choices to make in the coming future, and many issues to deal with, if it is to survive as a newly-freed nation."

Now, this ‘Hyperprésident’ has finally met his match - and with it the fate of Gabon lies in the balance. \n\nIn the early hours of the morning, M’ba was awoken to sounds of gunfire as a group of armed separatists began to make their way through Libreville. Escaping with the help of his aids, M’ba has rallied with his forces outside the city and has instructed them to hold the enemy here while he and a few of his most trusted advisors make a run for friendly territory farther East. However, the separatists, led by the young General Charles N'Tchoréré, have been making quick work of M’ba’s loyalists and are making their way through Libreville and to their rally location far faster than expected. The Hyperprésident’s only hope now is that his friendly contacts in the nationalist French government send aid soon enough for his regime to hold on."

Citizens are arbitrarily arrested or threatened at random and coerced as prisoners into working on public works or infrastructure projects as M'Ba sees fit. It is believed the President's very own estate, in all its grandeur, was built with the hands of forced labor. Political prisoners, of which there are many, endure the worst conditions, however. The regime has seen an opportunity to transform these treacherous dissidents into proper, obedient servants of the state. With prison facilities overcrowded thanks to the criminalization and banning of more liberties, political prisoners are sent to work logging or in the manganese mines in what can only be called appalling conditions. Supervisors have no qualms whipping and torturing inefficient or troublesome laborers. The death toll in Gabonese workplaces steadily creeps up, with even women and children being subjected to the work in certain cases. Of course, the regime plays its cards carefully. Members of the Fang and the remnants of the French population are spared the cruelty, so long as they do not oppose the state. In fact, many in these groups enjoy very light if not nonexistent workloads as the forced laborers already account for almost of state expenditures. The system in place is becoming harder for the regime to conceal, but it makes little difference. M’Ba’s mooks ensure the most sensitive details are hidden away and media is bribed. Besides, with the French appeased and most of the world busy with other turmoil, it seems very few are paying mind to the plight of the Gabonese…"

gab.17.d:0 "Seeking to distance himself and Gabon from the colonials without fully-breaking with them, Leon M’ba has begun to walk away from the Roman Catholic faith of his raising and began to drift to the native Gabonese Bwiti faith. Created by the Punu, Mitsogo, and Fang peoples of Gabon, Bwiti is a syncretic mix of animism, Christianity, and ancestral worship heavily centered around the communal consumption of the root bark of the Tabernanthe iboga plant - a root bark specially cultivated by Bwiti practitioners that causes hallucinogenic effects. \n\nPromoted as a mental, spiritual, and bodily health cure-all, the bark root is consumed regularly for holidays, rituals, rite-of-passages, to smooth familial relations, to foster bonding between friends and loved-ones, to encourage spiritual growth, and to even heal the sick. These rituals are always led by N’ganga, or spirit healers that grow, harvest, and process the root for this plethora of uses. \n\nTo show his dedication to his new faith, M’ba has met with the most honored N’gangas in the nation to hold a Bwiti ritual of their own, consuming the root bark to commune together spiritually as they are assailed by strange and complex visions, insights, and hallucinations. Dressed in their ceremonial red, black, and white robes as frantic, dance inducing Bwiti music blared all around them, M’ba and his spirit guides were sent on an odyssey of the soul, going to the brink and back together under the influence of the root as they say in the dark, sap-torch lit room. \n\nAfter hours of tripping and being granted the sight of God, the group came too, closer than ever before and more ready to help lead Gabon into its new, independent future, free from unwanted demons or influence."

To finalize the new direction of Gabon and wider French Equatorial Africa, M’ba knew what needed to be done. Called the ‘Hyperpurge’ by detractors of M’ba in an attempt to mock his curious and extravagant title, the nickname is no exaggeration. By sword, by torch, and by fired lead, the Hyperprésident aims to cleanse our state of any enemies, naysayers, and ne'er-do-wells, no matter the cost, removing these parasites from any and all positions of influence and power. \n\nAny official with Socialist ties, allies in foreign regimes that are not France, or loyalties to M’ba’s various political opponents are to be arrested, though many have attempted to flee as word of our actions spread. Any of those who attempt to flee have been labeled as traitors to the state, and are to be shot on sight, denied the mercy allotted to their comrades who simply surrendered to prison sentences and time in M’ba’s labor army. As for non-officials that are still deemed ‘unpure,’ they have two simple options - surrender and live out your prison sentence to earn your penance, or simply face the wall and take the bullet with your name on it. Hyperprésident M’ba’s new state would be consolidated and would be cleansed, for no weakness was allowed in this new Gabon - only perfection."

In the aftermath of the coup, many efforts have been made to ensure M'ba's presidency is never again threatened, including the suppression of rivals, purging of the armed forces, a reshuffle of the federal cabinet, and so on. With his rule growing more and more consolidated, many within the president's inner circle, and even the president himself have wondered, why keep the pretense of republicanism? Really, what good has that form of government done for us? \n\nTo this end, the Hyperprésident has instructed his lackeys to begin preparations to draft a new constitution, one that truly fits our new Gabonese values of profit, kleptocratic practices, and self-indulgence over all other merits and goals. In the meantime, the President shall continue to evolve and maintain his rule, enforcing the law, and getting ever richer in the process.

This reality is true now that Léon M'Ba and his troops, thanks to the great support of the French government in exile in Algiers, have succeeded in unifying the whole of Equatorial Africa under his rule.\n\nShortly after this victory, the French delegation led by the young ethnologist and diplomat Jacques Soustelle met with the Gabonese president Léon M'Ba in order to thank him for his proud services to the French homeland and to grant him the title of Governor General of French Equatorial Africa, which M'Ba, always in search of more wealth, accepted without flinching. Even with a Gabonese at its head, the vast majority of the administrative apparatus of the new colony was composed of French rather than Gabonese, most of them being under the control of the very corrupt and unscrupulous Governor General. In addition to the corruption inherent in the administration of the colony, the army is also composed of M'Ba loyalists and francophiles, who serve to maintain the power of the paranoid M'Ba and to eliminate anyone who would oppose him. To everyone's surprise, the Governor General announced the establishment of local governments in a move to decentralize the vast colony. Few people know his real intentions with this measure, some think he is doing this because deep down he loves the African people, the majority of people however know that he has done this only to appease and please the people.\n\nNevertheless, the French colonial administration is back, and is here to stay."

gab.21.t:0 "A Modern and Western Africa"
gab.21.d:0 "All of Gondjout's efforts to create a democratic and modern Africa seem to have come to an end the night he gave his speech announcing the unification of all the lands of Equatorial Africa.\n\nA strong proponent of French-style democracy and the Western way of life, Gondjout and his allies have already launched ambitious modernization projects throughout Equatorial Africa in an effort to bring Africa to a level of development and modernity similar to Europe. The task will undoubtedly be long and arduous, but as the unification of Equatorial Africa has shown, even the craziest of projects can ultimately be realized. Many new political parties have already begun to form, showing that a political consciousness is awakening among the African people, who have too often been ruled against their will by the former colonial administrations. On the economic level, we also see many Africans going into the world of business by creating their own small businesses, which would not have been possible without the introduction of capitalism by Gondjout. One of the most positive development factors is the emergence of an African middle class living a typical Western lifestyle.\n\nGondjout can be justifiably proud of himself as Africa finally enters the 20th century."
gab.21.a:0 "A perfect example of African democracy!"

gab.22.t:0 "A Truly United Equatorial Africa"
gab.22.d:0 "The people who live in Equatorial Africa belong to very different ethnic groups and practice very different faiths, which creates many tensions and traditionally prevents these peoples from peacefully coexisting. One could say that Equatorial Africa, even if unified by arms, could never be truly united, however, one man has shown us the opposite, President Jean-Hilaire Aubame.\n\nThanks to the establishment and intensification in Equatorial Africa of civic nationalist rhetoric such as in Gabon, the ethnic frontiers that served as dividing factors for the people seem to be gradually fading away in favor of a common identity that accepts and gives equal opportunities to everyone. In addition to this, many missionaries are sent throughout the immense Equatorial Africa to the smallest village to spread the only true faith, Catholicism, which has also greatly contributed to unify the people who are slowly but surely converting to the Faith and abandoning their heretical and pagan customs. However, Aubame's projects did not stop there, he also brought freedom and democracy to the African people.\n\nA united, capitalist, pious and democratic society has been established in Equatorial Africa, may the Lord bless Aubame and the African people."
gab.22.a:0 "United in Faith."

gab.230.t:0 "One More Step Towards the Liberation of Africa"
gab.230.d:0 "Sousatte, a long-time Pan-Africanist, is undoubtedly the most competent person to unify and lead Equatorial Africa, and he proved it today.\n\nA purely African Equatorial Africa, economically and politically, anti-imperialist and applying the principles of socialist democracy has come into being. Already the Red Militia is moving through the country, multiplying aid to the poor and oppressed, distributing food, water and giving hope to all those peoples who have for too long been oppressed by the imperialist boot, be it French, German or others. The African people of Equatorial Africa can now rest easy, while the Red Militia relentlessly hunts down the colonialists who have not yet left the country and the false Africans who collaborated or worked for them. Sousatte has implemented his pan-African agrarian economy plans on a country-wide scale, giving mechanical material to the poor African farmers who welcome the news with great joy. Sousatte is also a great believer in democracy, and he intends to create a political consciousness among his people, therefore he has launched a great campaign to disseminate the ideals of Marx and many socialist theorists, as well as his own ideas, and encourage his people to participate in creating a local democracy in their communities.\n\nOf course, some reactionaries have judged our practices as bad, calling them 'anti-democratic' or accusing us of 'indoctrinating' the people, but of course we know what is best for the African people, socialism being the only way to freedom, the Red Militia will deal with these reactionaries and their illegal activities, non-socialist parties being obviously forbidden in our purely democratic society."
gab.230.a:0 "Little by little, Africa is freeing itself from its chains."

gab.23.t:0 "The Destiny Of Africa"
gab.23.d:0 "With his party's position secured and his reforms implemented, Sousatte seems to have achieved the goals he had always dreamed of. Gabon is now a socialist country with a purely Afro-Syndicalist economy free of all harmful European influences, a glowing socialist democracy and a Red Militia that the people cheer loudly at all its parades in the streets of Libreville. The people do not know hunger, thirst and misery anymore, thanks to all the efforts of Sousatte and the PUNGA, Gabon seems to be a real paradise. However, Sousatte is not resting on his laurels, he recently announced that Equatorial Africa, and one day all of Africa, would be unified under Pan-African socialism, this process will undoubtedly be fraught with difficulties, the imperialists will do everything to stop us, but no cost is too great for the liberation of Africa and its people."
gab.23.a:0 "All of Equatorial Africa will soon be under the Pan-African flag!"

gab.24.t:0 "A Militia For The People"
gab.24.d:0 "We have seen that our armed forces can sometimes pose problems for the government, as in the coup against Leon M'Ba. Sousatte is worried that the army will do to him what it did to the deposed Hyperpresident, although Sousatte is far from being a tyrant like M'Ba, the Gabonese armed forces have repeatedly expressed their opposition to socialism. Sousatte, being the great leader that he is, found a perfect solution to defend his rightful presidency, the creation of the Red Militia was ordered, placed directly under the control of the Ministry of the Interior. Composed of volunteers from the working classes of Gabon, this militia swore an oath to dedicate their services to socialist democracy and to Sousatte, and are professionally trained in the military arts as well as in Sousatte's Afro-Syndicalist theories. The opposition decried the measure as anti-constitutional, and accused Sousatte of wanting to create an ideological police force, which would go against democratic principles and would serve Sousatte's personal interests. Of course, our people do not listen to the lies of these reactionaries and welcome the new militia with open arms, the militia having started educational campaigns and having opened soup kitchens all over the country."
gab.24.a:0 "My life for Sousatte and socialism!"

gab.25.t:0 "A Red Gabon"
gab.25.d:0 "The working masses of Gabon have woken up, they have expressed their will for justice, freedom but above all for socialism by electing René-Paul Sousatte and the PUNGA in the first Gabonese democratic elections in the history of the country despite the efforts of the reactionaries and liberals to prevent such an outcome. The process of transforming Gabon from an ex-colonial society to a socialist country has already begun and the people are undoubtedly on our side. However, it would be foolish to think that the imperialists and reactionaries have given up their goal of enslaving Gabon, it is our legitimate duty as the people's representative to prevent any harmful influence to reach the Gabonese workers. President Sousatte is well aware of this, which is why he issued a presidential decree this morning banning all non-socialist parties from participating in any type of election, whether national, local or legislative. The reactionaries stupid enough to denounce our just measure were quickly silenced by our faithful Red Militia, the others preferring the path of exile. With the position of the PUNGA secured, we now have the full ability to lead our people to true democracy and socialism, even if we must force their hand in the process."
gab.25.a:0 "We can't let the reactionaries stop the revolution!"

gab.26.t:0 "A True Friendship"
gab.26.d:0 "Few in Gabon carry in their hearts the collaboration between France and Gabon. Although it is undeniably certain that without the help that France had given to M'Ba the independence of Gabon would have been much harder to achieve, the collaboration that President M'Ba so much praised seemed more of an unbalanced relationship where France would control Gabon as a colony, making the Gabonese struggle against the German oppressors futile. Paul Gondjout, is here to show a new way of collaboration, that of an equal and sincere friendship between Gabon and France where each of the two countries, on the same footing, would draw a beneficial result from this friendship, an alliance motivated by a real mutual respect between the two countries, and not the search for personal profit at the expense of the people as M'Ba wanted. On the contrary, President Gondjout is entirely dedicated to the people and intends to bring them the benefits of democracy, modeled on the principles of French liberalism that Gondjout greatly admires and respects."
gab.26.a:0 "As equals this time, Gabonese and French are walking together toward a bright future."

gab.27.t:0 "A Modern Gabon"
gab.27.d:0 "It is undeniable that the primary objective of Paul Gondjout, now president, and his Parti Démocratique Gabonais is to transform Gabon from an unscrupulously exploited land under the colonial yoke into a true democratic, modern and westernized country. The liberalization of the market according to Keynesian principles in order to develop the country and create a true entrepreneurial spirit among the Gabonese people, the establishment of a social security system and the creation of a modern educational system are indispensable steps in the transformation process of Gabon. Freedom is the watchword of the PDG and of the president who as an Evolués had the chance to study great authors of the Enlightenment such as Voltaire, Montesquieu, or Diderot and intends to apply the principles they developed to his beloved country, ensuring the preservation of the fundamental rights and freedoms of his people, which have been for so long forbidden to the Gabonese by the vile colonial administration. Under Gondjout's guidance, a light is being turned on in the heart of the dark African continent."
gab.27.a:0 "Union, Travail, Justice!"

gab.28.t:0 "Our Old Friends In Algiers"
gab.28.d:0 "Having greatly helped us in our war to secure our independence, it is only natural that the Gabonese people should be greatly grateful to our friends in France. The most grateful of all our compatriots is undoubtedly our president, Leon M'Ba himself, in fact, his reputation as a Francophile and his numerous contacts allow him to maintain a privileged relationship with the French government in exile in Algiers, which our president greatly admires. Today was received in Gabon Jacques Foccart, diplomat representing France, a meeting took place between him and Leon M'Ba, where Foccart reaffirmed the full support of his country to Gabon and its president and declared that France will always support its friends in Africa. Some rumors say that Leon M'Ba even proposed the transformation of Gabon into a French department, which Foccart refused. Regardless, alongside our French allies, Gabon is moving towards glorious days."

Despite a few demonstrations with slogans such as  'Leon M'Ba, president of the French!' or calling for an end to the dictatorship, the president continues to rule his country as he pleases, with a kleptocracy now firmly entrenched in the very heart of the Gabonese political system. With the full support of his dear French friends, the madman seems to have given himself a new objective: to restore French Equatorial Africa in all its glory."

gab.30.t:0 "With our conquest and colidation over all of Equatorial Africa, Leon M’ba has led our people from the shores and forests of Gabon across the heart of Africa, reuniting our fellow Francophones in the wake of Mittelafrika’s demise. Now, with this vast swathe of land under the control of our Hyperprésident and his administration, the time has come to choose our new destiny. Though we shall always be tied to our mother nation and people of France, perhaps it is time for us to spread our own wings and form our new syncretic identity. Conversely, we can simply continue to forge a path parallel to France and slowly rise to become a department within the larger French Empire. At this crossroads, only Hyperprésident M’ba has the judgement sharp enough to guide us, and now the choice lies with him."

gab.301.t:0 "With our decision to stay loyal to the true French, the colonial meddlers of the Algiers government cannot help but to interfere in our affairs yet again, as they are prone to do. The frogs have begun to suggest that we should replace M’ba as the governor general of this ‘neo-colony’ in order to foster a more cohesive, stable, and profitable state. They argue that M’ba is far too kleptocratic and authoritarian for the good of Equatorial Africa, for his open corruption, criminal pursuits, and hedonistic lifestyle have come together to paint a poor image for our Gabonese allies in the eyes of the rest of the world. Though M’ba is loyal to France, he may be more loyal to himself and his own ambitions, so perhaps it is time for a change in leadership."

This dire situation has begun to cause our economy to hemorrhage, and the people at home ache for peace, citing that this war is useless to those in need at home. With this in mind, many within our cabinet have begun to urge us to sue for peace with the Gabonese, though that would likely mean ceding most of our African holdings to them. The alternative however, would require us to rally the troops and launch a full-scale invasion of Africa’s Central Coast - an idea no one cherishes.

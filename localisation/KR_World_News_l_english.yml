Since the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange in 1925 the economy of the United States has been sluggish and mired in deep recession.\nNow, the United States has collapsed into an all-out civil war between the supporters of the Federal Government, the Combined Syndicates of America, the populist American Union State, the reactionary Constitutional American Republic, and the remnants of democratic rule in the Pacific States of America. Volunteers are pouring in from around the world to support one faction or another, with some characterising the bitter ideological conflict as simply part of a wider global clash of ideals."

In this timeline, Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party win the 1912 American presidential elections, leading to an American entry in the Weltkrieg and an Entente victory. A defeated and partially occupied Germany is gripped by constant economic and political crises, witnesses the defeat of the Whites in the Russian Civil War, and is couped by a bitter and extremely nationalist Adam Dressler. He leads the German Workers Party who follow the ideology of \"People's Socialism\", an extreme version of National Populism.\n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a three-sided war between Dressler's \"New Reich\", the Western Entente led by the dominant British Empire, and a Soviet Russia led by Sergey Kirov. The book has divided critics, with some praising its attention to detail, while others criticise it for large flaws in historical logic.

Now, with all other parts of the Empire occupied by Austrian troops, the government in Vienna has announced a return to the Austrian Empire as it was before 1867 - centralized under Vienna, committed to the status quo and reaction.

With German and Royalist forces gathered on the Meuse for a swift counter-attack, hopes for the survival of Syndicalism in Wallonia fell onto Paris.\nWith tensions rising between the German Empire and the Commune, it seems that France blinked first. Seemingly unwilling to bring down the wrath of Germany on them, even now, France was unwilling to offer guarantees to the Walloon rebels. The survival of the independence movement now seems in doubt, and there are few who believe that King Adelbert's regime will now fall. However, war between the great powers has been avoided - for now."

worldnews.201.d:0 "The Sudan has long been known as a land of religious firebrands and fierce peoples, a fact that even the British Empire at its peak was forced to discover at the end of the last century. Now it seems that the Egyptians are once more facing a serious revolt in the southern region, led by Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, the son of Muhammad Ahmad, the Mahdi of the original 1881 rebellion. Calling for God-mandated resistance against the Egyptian occupiers from a balcony in Khartoum, Abd al-Rahman's powerful rhetoric has contributed to a total breakdown of Cairo's rule in the region. Though it is unclear whether he has the backing of most of Sudan's tribes, it is clear that a brutal war lies ahead."

Yet this morning he and Assembly President Cao Kun announced their formal support of the provincial government of Anhui, lead by [ANQ.GetLeader]. Wu and Cao have long chafed under the German oversight placed on their government in 1927, and their support of Governor Chen telegraphed to the world that they were casting off German influence. While a full deployment of the Qing army is unlikely given the ever-present threat of Fengtian attack from the north, limited numbers of Qing troops are already mobilizing to destroy the enemies of Governor Chen and Beijing's new national order."

He was the last leader of the Old School - a bulwark against radicalism, a rallying point in war, a stable leader in unstable times. With his death, Kronprinz Friedrich Wilhelm will ascend to the throne as Wilhelm III. More of a modernizer and extremist than his father, his succession marks a sea change in German politics and diplomacy.

The novel takes place in an alternate timeline where the Russians earn a Pyrrhic victory in the Russo-Japanese War. This leads to a chain of events that results in a World War where France falls to Germany as the Germanic homelands back East are engulfed by revolution, falling to a Syndicalist regime. The French are not able to seize on this opportunity of weakness, as they themselves are toppled by Surrealist and Avant-Garde forces as the army mutinees and French normalcy collapses overnight. Meanwhile, Russia is thrown into chaos as Kolchak seizes power, supported by the Black Hundreds, creating a totalitarian ultra-nationalist dictatorship with a loose grip on the many territories outside of Moscow's reach. Europe is soon embroiled into war once more, and Lithuania becomes the front line of the Eastern Front; a bloodbath between the Germans and Russians where even the strongest men perish and die in minutes. The end of the novel hints at a possible Russian breakthrough, as well as a naval invasion by an ambitious British Empire... \n\nThe book has been criticized for horrid descriptions of cruelty and war crimes, but Šeinius defends his tale, saying that 'something like this could have happened in another Universe'."

The book begins to dramatically pick up its pace in the early 1960’s, where Dressler’s own health is ailing, and the issue of his successor dominates the nation. Meanwhile, Japan brutally dominates the entirety of East Asia with no one left to oppose the will of the Emperor, and a stable, if not stagnating, United States stands as the last vanguard of democracy on earth. The story further intensifies after the death of Dressler, with Germany later descending into a four way civil war. As well as the later re-unification of Russia under the so-called Holy Russian Empire led by self proclaimed “Regent” Rasputin, who believes that Nicholas II is still alive but needs Russia to be “cleansed” before he can return. England also falls into a bloody civil war between the loyalists of George and a big-tent coalition of forces loyal to the exiled King Edward, republicans and even syndicalists. \n\nThe book has been almost universally hated by critics and torn apart by history buffs and readers alike for a variety of reasons. Details such as the collapse of Germany, the Thuleschutztruppe state in France secretly being behind all major world developments, the collapse of Russia into a realm of warlords, the draining of the Mediterranean, and several other nonsensical plot points have all contributed to the book’s utter failure in gaining popularity. In addition, many believe the book came off as preachy and generally poorly written. Even Churchill himself has admitted that the book was not his best work."

 worldnews.1247.d:0 "Today, in an elaborate ceremony, the Holy Father formally consecrated the lands of France to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Doing so on the behest of a small but vocal group, the idea of Consecrating France stems from the Marian apparitions in Fatima, Portugal. In the visons, the Virgin Mary warned the world of the evils of socialism, allegedly predicting the rise of Syndicalism in France. Along with this, Mary proclaimed that 'France would spread her evils around the world' if it was not consecrated to her Immaculate Heart. International reactions to the Consecration have been mixed, with socialists around the world condemning the move, calling it an abuse of Papal authority. Regardless of this, Mary's alleged wishes have come to be reality, if anything comes of this remains to be seen."

Doing so on the behest of a small but vocal group, the idea of Consecrating the world stems from the Marian apparitions in Fatima, Portugal. In the visons, the Virgin Mary warned the world of the evils of socialism, allegedly predicting the rise of Syndicalism in France and Britain. Along with this, Mary proclaimed that 'France would spread her evils around the world' if it was not consecrated to her Immaculate Heart. Taking this a step further, the Holy Father has seen fit to not just consercrate France, but the enitre world. Reactions to the Consecration have been mixed, with socialists around the world condemning the move, calling it an abuse of Papal authority. While some of those within the group that called for the Consecration called it not good enough, as it was France, and not the Earth, that was called for to be consecrated.  Regardless of this, Mary's alleged wishes have come to be reality, if anything comes of this remains to be seen."

 worldnews.1249.d:0 "After the loss of the First Leticia War, in which Colombia lost the Amazon Department and parts of other departments, Colombia now stands once again against Peru. Colombian citizens are told that this war isn't just a war filled with vengeance and angerment towards the Peruvians but a 'crusade' and that 'Colombia has risen to redeem itself after years of losing territories'. With fresh new blood to be spilled for both sides Colombia is leading the troubled continent of South America to be dragged into a war yet again. Although the outcome seems indecisive, both sides are willing to fight till the end. Will the second war fall in line with the last war and Colombia plunged into further chaos or will the once biggest south american empire be able to stand up against Peru this time for Patria and for Honor?"

 worldnews.1251.d:0 "As the Colombian elections come to an end, it has been clear that the Leopardos have gained the majority. There appears however to already be a split in the party between President and ex-general Carlos Cortes Vargas and some major party's ideologues, this so far small occurrence might lead to a bigger one. What they all seem to agree on is that the 'decaying and dying' paternalistic attitude of priests and cardinals in Colombia is for the backwards and not forward thinking, and as such they aim for further state-church separation, strengthening Catholicism in the heart of the people by distancing it from politics. What's clear is that Leopardos have a certain new future for Colombia in mind and hope to change the country from it's decaying state into a modern power. Will these leopards prove as such or just oversized kittens?"

Although a very unstable bloc, these members and the newly elected president Gomez Castro have to all work together from now on in order to contain the Gaitanist threat. Los Chulavitas are holding onto the majority of the government while Los Leopardos have the smallest influence on the government and could prove a dangerous ally, opposing Gomez Castro's idea of an integralist catholic state. Despite all that the whole Bloc ultimately promisies the liberation from socialism, into an era of stability and wellbeing for all righteous citizens."

Coming to power as the result of former Chairman Oswald Mosley's failed attempt to seize total control over Britain viva tact use of the Military. While Hobart has announced that the Revolution is dead and over, the future of Britain seems in flux.

worldnews.1256.d:0 "Ever since Quintin Lame, the most popular and well recognized leader of the colombian indigenous people, published a manifesto asking for more rights for the benefit of 'all native people of Colombia' there have been much speculation and many satirical vignette who joked about an 'Oiga-Mire' war was about to brake Colombia apart. This originated from the fact Quintin and his insurgent group are mainly based in the Cauca region where the common saying for calling the attention of someone is in fact 'Oi!' a shortened version of 'Oiga' or 'listen' in english, while in the Cundinamarca region, alongside almost every other territory of the country, the most popular saying has always been 'Mire' which means 'look, here'. Many local papers picked up this difference to illustrate the state of deep cultural divide that is felt between the central andean region where Bogota sits and most other territories far from the capital. These could degenerate into not only a war for rights but a bigger 'us, the forgotten, versus them the establishment' type of conflict. For this reason Quintin Lame and his insurgent group are expected to at least align informally with the socialist rebellion that is already raging on in Colombia. The future for the country gets bleacker and bleacker every day."

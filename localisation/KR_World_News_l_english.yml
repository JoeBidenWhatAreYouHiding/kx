Since the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange in 1925 the economy of the United States has been sluggish and mired in deep recession.\nNow, the United States has collapsed into an all-out civil war between the supporters of the Federal Government, the Combined Syndicates of America, the populist American Union State, the reactionary Constitutional American Republic, and the remnants of democratic rule in the Pacific States of America. Volunteers are pouring in from around the world to support one faction or another, with some characterising the bitter ideological conflict as simply part of a wider global clash of ideals."

In this timeline, Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party win the 1912 American presidential elections, leading to an American entry in the Weltkrieg and an Entente victory. A defeated and partially occupied Germany is gripped by constant economic and political crises, witnesses the defeat of the Whites in the Russian Civil War, and is couped by a bitter and extremely nationalist Adam Dressler. He leads the German Workers Party who follow the ideology of \"People's Socialism\", an extreme version of National Populism.\n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a three-sided war between Dressler's \"New Reich\", the Western Entente led by the dominant British Empire, and a Soviet Russia led by Sergey Kirov. The book has divided critics, with some praising its attention to detail, while others criticise it for large flaws in historical logic.

Now, with all other parts of the Empire occupied by Austrian troops, the government in Vienna has announced a return to the Austrian Empire as it was before 1867 - centralized under Vienna, committed to the status quo and reaction.

Wu and Cao have long chafed under the German oversight placed on their government in 1927, and their support of Governor Chen telegraphed to the world that they were casting off German influence. While a full deployment of the Qing army is unlikely given the ever-present threat of Fengtian attack from the north, limited numbers of Qing troops are already mobilizing to destroy the enemies of Governor Chen and Beijing's new national order."

Following a victory by the Integralists in elections, and a public consultation on the matter, today at the Candelária Cathedral in Rio the Emperor Pedro III of Brazil was crowned in an unusually lavish ceremony even for monarchic standards. Now, the Integralists and the new Emperor will set their sights in restoring the former glory of Brazil, and will no doubt change the nation in a perhaps irreversible fashion. While republican demonstrations were held at the time of the ceremony, they were swiftly dispersed by the Army, and the nation wonders if this Empire will finally bring peace to the troubled South American country."

The worried government in Rio de Janeiro ordered his arrest, however the man's loyal military men refused the order, and he rose in open revolt in the north of the country. While the revolt has a deep rooted republican origin, his support of local strongmen is also speculated to come from traditionally powerful politicians whom were losing power in the new Integralist order of things.

worldnews.561.d:0 "Following the death of self-proclaimed 'Archregent' Phillip Acosta Carroll of America a short time ago, the Holy American League, the big tent political party founded by Carroll to protect and serve Catholic interests with in the American Union State, entered a period of minor chaos at the sudden death of their beloved leader. However, it appears the period of chaos is over, and from the chaos has comes not a leader, but an ideal. Known as the 'National Salvation Decree' the Holy American League Congress, following a period of deadlock and attempted coup, has voted to take parts from each faction and incorporate them into their policy. The seat of Archregent shall remain unfilled, and yet jointly occupied by each faction at once. The Congress shall also remain a permanent fixture. Despite this, the nation is still engulfed in chaos, and if this move of compromise will amount to anything more then a delay in the inevitable remains to be seen."

worldnews.562.d:0 "Following a rather chaotic few weeks since his election, Phillip Acosta Carroll has just been sworn in as President of America. Carroll, belonging to the Holy American League, was elected on promises of both protecting Catholics and implementing a form of political Catholicism within America. However following his electoral victory, sweeping protests and riots began to spring out across the nation, what's more, Carroll provided evidence to Congress that these opposition groups were planning to blow up the capital building. He then request neigh unlimited political power to deal with these rebels, which Congress was more then willing to give. Thus Carroll, the first Catholic president in American history, has also become the most powerful, easily trumping MacArthur's hold over the government. What this means for the future of America is anyone's guess. "

worldnews.2453.t:0 "Red Flood"
worldnews.2453.d:0 "Ignas Šeinius, Lithuania's most famous Impressionist writer, has recently published a new book, 'Raudonasis tvanas' (The Red Flood) that has just breached Lithuania's prison in literary obscurity. \n\nMuch like his famous 'Kuprelis', Red Flood is a gripping impressionist tale about a love story between two young individuals in a divided country, but what is must interesting is the setting of the story. The novel takes place in an alternate timeline where the Russians earn a Pyrrhic victory in the Russo-Japanese War. This leads to a chain of events that results in a World War where France falls to Germany as the Germanic homelands back East are engulfed by revolution, falling to a Syndicalist regime. The French are not able to seize on this opportunity of weakness, as they themselves are toppled by Surrealist and Avant-Garde forces as the army mutinees and French normalcy collapses overnight. Meanwhile, Russia is thrown into chaos as Kolchak seizes power, supported by the Black Hundreds, creating a totalitarian ultra-nationalist dictatorship with a loose grip on the many territories outside of Moscow's reach. Europe is soon embroiled into war once more, and Lithuania becomes the front line of the Eastern Front; a bloodbath between the Germans and Russians where even the strongest men perish and die in minutes. The end of the novel hints at a possible Russian breakthrough, as well as a naval invasion by an ambitious British Empire... \n\nThe book has been criticized for horrid descriptions of cruelty and war crimes, but Šeinius defends his tale, saying that 'something like this could have happened in another Universe'."

worldnews.2454.t:0 "\"Our Darkest Hour: Final Days of Europa\""
worldnews.2454.d:0 "British politician and former Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill has published a sequel to his book, “Our Finest Hour” titled “Our Darkest Hour: Final Days of Europa”.\n\nGermany stands victorious in Europe and has carved the continent out for itself, however the nation is far from stable; a key example being Dressler being forced to give the Thuleschutztruppe and Horst Wessel their own state in France, as a result of a failed coup. Britain herself has also fallen under Dressler's thumb, being forced to release Scotland and Wales and rechristen herself the Kingdom of England; a mere Volkish mockery of the United Kingdom with King Edward's brother George on the throne. The book begins to dramatically pick up its pace in the early 1960’s, where Dressler’s own health is ailing, and the issue of his successor dominates the nation. Meanwhile, Japan brutally dominates the entirety of East Asia with no one left to oppose the will of the Emperor, and a stable, if not stagnating, United States stands as the last vanguard of democracy on earth. The story further intensifies after the death of Dressler, with Germany later descending into a four way civil war. As well as the later re-unification of Russia under the so-called Holy Russian Empire led by self proclaimed “Regent” Rasputin, who believes that Nicholas II is still alive but needs Russia to be “cleansed” before he can return. England also falls into a bloody civil war between the loyalists of George and a big-tent coalition of forces loyal to the exiled King Edward, republicans and even syndicalists. \n\nThe book has been almost universally hated by critics and torn apart by history buffs and readers alike for a variety of reasons. Details such as the collapse of Germany, the Thuleschutztruppe state in France secretly being behind all major world developments, the collapse of Russia into a realm of warlords, the draining of the Mediterranean, and several other nonsensical plot points have all contributed to the book’s utter failure in gaining popularity. In addition, many believe the book came off as preachy and generally poorly written. Even Churchill himself has admitted that the book was not his best work."

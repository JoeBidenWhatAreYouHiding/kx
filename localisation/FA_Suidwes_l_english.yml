#Decisions
NMB_reclamation_actions:0 "The African Reclamation Campaign"
NMB_reclamation_actions_desc:0 "The time for the grand Reclamation Campaign is upon us! We march forth from this last bastion to take back the Dark Continent for the Kaiser from these vile separatists. Onwards, men! Heia! Heia Safari!"

NMB_in_Zambia:0 "Restore Responsible Government in Northern Rhodesia"
NMB_in_Zambia_desc:0 "We march with our forces to mop up the remaining traitorous dogs in Lusaka. With its capture, Nordrhodesisen will once again lie within the hands of virtuous, loyal Germans. With the Kaiser’s light gracing this land once again, we must install a loyal local administration to govern in our stead."

NMB_in_Namibiland:0 "Restore Responsible Government in Namibiland"
NMB_in_Namibiland_desc:0 "For the second time in a half-century, we must show the vile Herero who truly rules the Namib Desert. With these savages under our yoke once again, a new local governor will be instated to quell future instabilities; one who knows well the heavy hand needed to rule these harsh lands."

NMB_restore_Zambia:0 "Governance of Northern Rhodesia"
NMB_restore_Zambia_desc:0 "Now that Nordrhoedsien has been established once more under the Kaiser’s glorious light, the important decision of who shall lead the newly recreated colony has come up. Names such as Jünger or even Baring have come up, but no solid consensus has been reached. However, that soon must change as the colony needs its own Hauptman to be run effectively and to prevent another revolt."

NMB_restore_Namibiland:0 "Governance of Namibiland"
NMB_restore_Namibiland_desc:0 "Now that full control of Sudwestafrika has been established and the Kaiser’s forces once more occupy Namibiland, a new Hauptman must be chosen to oversee the Hereo, San, Nama and other native cretens. Unlike other colonies, we know just the man for this job. Famous South Afrikan lawyer and Germanic nationalist Johannes Van Rensburg. His reputation for an iron will and a sharp mind make him the ideal candidate to rule these wild and harsh lands."

NMB_in_Tanzania:0 "Restore Responsible Government in Tanganyika"
NMB_in_Tanzania_desc:0 "Göring’s mad fiefdom in Tanganyika has perverted the German civilizing mission and brought a black spot to the Dark Continent it has never experienced before. We march to Dar-Es-Salaam to topple this mad king  and restore the light of the Kaiser to these infected lands."

NMB_restore_Tanzania:0 "Governance of Tanganyika"
NMB_restore_Tanzania_desc:0 "With Tanganyika firmly in the grip of the forces of the Kaisereich, and with Göring disposed of, a new administration must take up governance in Dar-Es-Salaam, old capital of the Mittelafrika project. We must ensure Göring’s replacement is adept and measured so we may restore the old heart of the Kaiser’s domain in Africa."

NMB_in_Congo:0 "Intervening in the Congolese civil war"
NMB_in_Congo_desc:0 "A direct line from Pierre Ryckmans, Governor-General of the Congo-Vrijstaat, pleading for help with the recent outbreak of the civil war in the colony. We must ride into Leopoldville and save the colonial government from complete collapse, lest we lost the great expanse of the Congo to the whims of the Dark Continent."

NMB_in_Kenya:0 "Intervening in the Mau Mau uprising"
NMB_in_Kenya_desc:0 "News from the Kenyan highlands have reached Windhoek. It seems the reds pulling the strings of the Mau-Mau revolt have gotten brazen, and their insurrection has spiralled out of control, endangering our hold on the cradle of humanity. We must ride to Nairobi and save the colony from complete collapse. Obama and his ragtag fighters must not be allowed to rule over our colonial domain."

NMB_in_Kikuyuland:0 "Restoring Responsible Government in Kenya-Uganda"
NMB_in_Kikuyuland_desc:0 "Nairobi has fallen to the sway of Marxism as the Mau-Mau flag rises above the city. This must not be allowed to stand! We shall march into every city and every township and put this insurrection down at the barrel of our mausers. The Kaiser’s light will grace the cradle of humankind once more."

NMB_Kenyan_Traitors:0 "Restoring Responsible Government in Kenya-Uganda"
NMB_Kenyan_Traitors_desc:0 "It seems the traitorous administration in Kenya-Uganda has spat in the face of the Kaiser’s original mission and have fallen in with Göring’s deluded personal fiefdom in Tanganyika. We must show them the error of their ways, and what better way to teach a lesson than a rifle and some shot."

NMB_in_Gabon:0 "Restore Responsible Government in Gabon"
NMB_in_Gabon_desc:0 "Gabon has recently broken free of the grand project of Mittelafrika under the leadership of pro-National France elements and must be gathered back into the fold. Though the local French are among our greatest enemies, at least they aren’t natives, or worse, syndicalists."

NMB_Gabon_Wakanda:0 "Restore Responsible Government in Gabon"
NMB_Gabon_Wakanda_desc:0 "Scheiße! The foul infestation of syndicalism has taken hold in the newly independent state of Gabon, threatening to poison the whole of the Dark Continent with its red taint. We must not allow this virus to spread and infect the minds of the natives! We will crush these marxist pigs without mercy nor remorse, cleansing this land of its corrupting influence. The reds seek only to trick the natives with false promises, only the light of the Kaiser can truly civilize these savages."

NMB_restore_Kenya:0 "Governance of Kenya-Uganda"
NMB_restore_Kenya_desc:0 "One of the suspected birthplaces of the human race, Kenya-Uganda is once again in the Kaiser’s hands. With his warm embrace, we shall civilize these backwards lands and uplift it to a more fitting state for its importance to our species as a whole. To ensure stability, a new local administration will have to be instituted to crack down on rany remaining Mau-Mau, or any other seperatist groups stupid enough to raise arms against us again."



#Events
swa.1.t:0 "Our new Gouverneur-General"
swa.1.d:0 "With our proud Anglo soldiers waltzing into Windhoek, the Union Jack finally flies over the Namib Desert. These harsh lands now serve as the newest staging ground for the true lions of africa in our crusade to retake the Dark Continent. With control established, we shall instate Louis Weichardt, local South African German known for his iron fist who made a name for himself in South Africa’s National Party. His brutal reputation will serve him well as new Gouverneur-General of the Namib."
swa.1.a:0 "Weichardt and his Grymshemde take the reins”

swa.2.t:0 "Darkness reigns over the Dark Continent"
swa.2.d:0 "Due to Göring’s rebellion and because of the mismanagement of Mittelafrika, their chain of command has broken down throughout the continent. Warlords and local rulers now hold more power in most areas than the German administration. The complex network of alliances that once made up Mittelafrika have been thrown into chaos, as the entire continent heads to war. The capital of Dar-Es-Salaam has been seized by Askari and mercenaries loyal to Göring, Südwestafrika has been seized by the local Schutztruppen and Sudwestafrika hangs precariously in the balance of outside forces with the sudden collapse of German influence in the region. Meanwhile, our brothers in Kenya-Uganda, Nigeria and north Rhodesia are in peril. The Kikuyu have risen up against the Kampala government, loyalists in Nyasaland are locked in conflict with the German governor in Lusaka and the islamic northern territories of Nigeria have risen up in revolt. Across the former British colonial sphere, the emergency network of telegram beacons is lit. Africa calls for aid."
swa.2.a:0 "And Cape Town will answer."

swa.3.t:0 "Setting up the new North Rhodesian Government"
swa.3.d:0 "With Northern Rhodesia finally returned to Anglo hands, we must now get to the task of reintegrating these lost lands into our sphere. To aid in this, a local administration will have to be created, but on how this should be done has caused fierce debate. Our allies in South Rhodesia seek to unite with their northern twin, creating a federalized, united Rhoedsian state. On the other hand, many MP’s in our government believe that creating an independent North Rhodesian state under the local Anglo leader Everly Baring and his United Empire League  would be more beneficial to the locals and cause less instability which is sorely needed as we seek to conquer all of German Africa back from the Hun.”
swa.3.a:0 "Reunite our friends in South Rhodesia with their northern brethren"
swa.3.b:0 "Allow Baring and his UEL to take the reigns"

swa.4.t:0 "Contacting Leopoldville"
swa.4.d:0 "Civil war has broken out in the Congo, and the local administration under Pierre Ryckmans has pleaded for our aid. A vital ally and a resource rich region in its own right, our local administration has declared full support for the Congo’s rightful government. We shall ride into Leopoldville with rifles and sabres at the ready to save the colony and crush this insurrection before it spirals out of control."
swa.4.a:0 "Saving Pierre Ryckman must be a top priority"

swa.5.t:0 "Help from Sudwestafrika"
swa.5.d:0 "The colony of Deutsch-Sudwestafrika lies to the North, nearly untouched by the ravages of the Mittelafrikan collapse. Thes fellow sons and daughters of the Kaiser have sent word that they wish to aid us in the coming war of reclamation. However, we can choose the level of cooperation to pursue. We may simply allow them to supply us with volunteers and equipment, to fully petition for entry into the Reichspakt, which the bigwigs in Berlin will likely accept. The choice is ours: give up our foreign policy independence but gain strong allies, or rely solely on less direct aid in the coming war."
swa.5.a:0 "Join the Reichspakt, we need the help."
swa.5.b:0 "Aid is enough, we shall conquer the Dark Continent on our own terms."

swa.6.t:0 "The Alten Kämpfer Break Away!"
swa.6.d:0 "Göring’s recent moves have gone too far in the eyes for much of the Alten Kämpfer of Mittelafrika. As he erects his personal fiefdom, the rest of the old guard watches with disgusted looks, but this passiveness continues no longer. Berthold von Deimling and the rest of the Alten Kämpfer have seceded from Göring’s camp, hoping to create a strong and stable resistance against this mad “king” of Mittelafriaka. With this evaporation of Göring’s strongest and most well respected allies, many feel the burning glare of the Kaiser will finally shed light on this wretched place. Unless a miracle occurs, Göring’s days in power are numbered."
swa.6.a:0 "The reign of this madman is nearing its end"

swa.9.t:0 "Help from South Africa"
swa.9.d:0 "Telegrams from the Cape have reached our offices. The government of South Africa has extended the olive branch to our administration, offering to help in our coming war if we simply join the Entente’s military alliance. This move is a no-brainer, and the choice is obvious. If we are to retake the Dark Continent, we will need the full backing of the British Empire-in-exile and all of its allies."
swa.9.a:0 "We march in lockstep with the Entente."

swa.10.t:0 "Setting up the new Kenyan-Ugandan Government"
swa.10.d:0 "The old colony of Kenya-Uganda was once the center of the British Empire in Eastern Africa. For too long has the cradle of humankind has languished under Hunnic domination. With our superior tactics and strategy, we have retaken these lands as the Union Jack flies over Nairobi and Kampala once more. With the war over and the Mau-Mau exterminated, a question has arisen: should the two colonies maintain their historic unity, or finally be severed into two, separate entities under Anglo and the Rothschilds’ watchful eyes? Though two administrations are harder to maintain than one, the ethnic and cultural divides may be too great for a unified colony to survive. Ultimately, the choice lies with us."
swa.10.a:0 "Kenya-Uganda remains indivisible"
swa.10.b:0 "Split the colony and give the remains to the Rothchilds"

swa.11.t:0 "The Central African Stage"
swa.11.d:0 "Tally-Ho, men! We are the true Lions of Africa and our prized prey lies just ahead. We are crouched like a hunting pride, poised to strike the heart of the Dark Continent as we swat away these Hunninc flies that infest our Empire’s rightful lands. For too long the German’s have infected these pristine lands with their filth. For our King we shall ride forth and cleanse their pestilence from these lands and restore the civilizing light of the British Empire. The final hunt is upon us, let us strike true!"
swa.11.a:0 "For King and Country! For Africa!"

NMB.collapse.4.t:0 "Restoration of Tanganyika"
NMB.collapse.4.d:0 "Göringia, decadent and repulsive fiefdom of the disgraceful Hermann Göring, has finally been toppled. Our brave Anglo soldiers have struck at the heart of the Hun’s Mittelafrika project, ripping out the black heart of the Kaiser’s colonial ambition. With these lands back in British hands, we shall restore the old colony of Tanganyika. With this, we are one step close to reconnecting our South African holdings with the north, and one step closer to restoring our former vast grip on the Dark Continent."
NMB.collapse.4.a:0 "The festering black heart of Africa has been excised”

NMB.collapse.8.t:0 "Help from Gabon"
NMB.collapse.8.d:0 "A private telegram has arrived from Libreville, which until recently was known as Tirpitzstadt. The message was sent by the now-free colonial government of Gabon who seek to join our illustrious alliance. That is, they *will* join if we agree to help them in their wars and respect their autonomy. Such small concessions are nothing compared to the bounties we will reclaim if we win the coming reclamation war, and so Gabon will be sworn in immediately as the newest member of the Reichpakt."
NMB.collapse.8.a:0 "We welcome the people of Gabon into the Reichpakt’s embrace."

NMB.collapse.9.t:0 "Restoration of Kenya-Uganda"
NMB.collapse.9.d:0 "The Union Jack once again flies in Nairobi and across the Kenyan highlands down to Kampala and the thicket of Uganda’s jungles. The cradle of humanity now full lies within our grip and the British Lion roars once again across all of southern and western Africa. The British Empire has restored much of its former glory as the descendants of the Anglo-Saxons now rule from Lake Victoria to the Cape of Good Hope. The sun has once again risen on the British Empire, and as we bask in the warming glow, we also step into our new future. The era of Anglo dominance is far from finished, and we will prove this to the world."
NMB.collapse.9.a:0 "The sun has risen once more upon a British Africa"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_AMIN_BUGHRA_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1901, in Hotan, Xinjiang Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! The early life of Muhammad Amin Bughra is shrouded in mystery, with scant clues alluding to him teaching at a Madrassa prior to his military service. Bughra's background as a Jadidist and a Turk granted him few luxuries, even under Ma Shaowu's governance in Hotan. Bughra displayed a strong determination to work for Xinjiang's unification, and despised the weak attitude for which Governor Yang kept his garrisons. At the same time, Bughra opposed the Han-centric army reforms being proposed by General Sheng Shicai, which placed the blame for army mismanagement on Islam rather than the opium epidemic."
POLITICS_SABIT_DAMULLA_ABDULBAKI_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1883, in Artush, Xinjiang Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki never expected to be the face of the Turkic nationalist movement in Xinjiang. A highly educated academic and journalist, Abdulbaki has corresponded with several of the world's most prominent living Jadidist scholars. Through Jadid circles, he became acquainted with prominent members of the East Turkestan nationalist movement, including the wealthy aristocrat Muhammad Amin Bughra, and through Bughra the wider nationalist movement. Due to his pleasant demeanour, pragmatic viewpoint, and fluency in several languages, the often at-odds nationalist factions agreed on Damulla for the role of East Turkestan's first head of state and government. Should East Turkestan secure its bid for independence, it is likely however that Damulla will be subsumed by whichever of the nation's factions comes out on top."

ETS_ensure_constitution: "Ensure Constitutional Protections"

ETS_investigation_office: "The Investigative Branch"
ETS_investigation_office_desc: "Our experiences with the Chinese have affected many with a deep hatred for that land's legal and philosophical ideas.

Having spent the last three decades forming militias using any firearms available, it is time we take an active role in supplying Eastern Turks with modern, formidable arms."

ETS_mountainous_officer_training: "Mountainous Officer Training"
 ETS_mountainous_officer_training_desc: "Volunteers coming into East Turkestan bring with them years of experience in traversing desert brush.

ets.0.t: "Situation in Kashgar and Hotan"
ets.0.d: "The initial uprising was a success! Our brothers in Kashgar and Hotan were able to overwhelm the local garrison and take control of both cities. With the people rallying to our side, the revolution is strong!\n\nOur revolution however, is far from secure. Unable to produce proper equipment due to Yang Zengxin's medieval industrial policies, our untrained irregulars stand little chance against the armies of Ma Shaowu and Jin Shuren without decisive political action. Our forces will need to be reformed if we are to have any hope of success, and we should try to act in the creation of military factories.\n\nPolitically, our new nation is in some ways united and in others divided completely. The eccentric Timur Beg, a veteran merchant leader and member of the local nobility near Kashgar, has taken the reigns of the Young Kashgar Party with his native city of Kashgar as their base of power. Meanwhile, the three siblings amirs of Hotan, the brutal Bughras, made wealthy through ownership of several profitable mining ventures, lead their forces from Hotan. Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki, a moderate western-educated general, has been appointed interim president. Though he is not an actual member of any party or faction, he garners most of his support from the Hotan based Bughras. However, many see Sabit Damulla as a unifying figure to the rebellion, who helps ease the tensions between the merchant of Kashgar and the Bughra brothers."
ets.0.a: "Allah is on our side"
ets.1.t: "The Delegations Are Ready"
ets.1.d: "Each member of the delegation knows his mission and each camel is rested and ready for a long journey. As a new nation, we must act hard to secure foreign support, to aid our militia in this current war and in any future war for independence, when the Chinese come knocking once again. We are now ready and prepared to send out delegations to other countries to persuade them to support our cause."

ets.8.d: "The delegation we sent to [From.GetName] brought great news. The [From.GetAdjective] government is very sympathetic to our cause, and decides to give their full support to help us achieve independence. They have provided a decent amount of rifles and ammunition, as well as some gold."
ets.8.a: "Great!"

ets.9.t: "Partial Support Given From [From.GetName]"
ets.9.d: "The delegation we sent to [From.GetName] brought good news. While the [From.GetAdjective] government is still somewhat reluctant to help us, they nevertheless are willing to hear us out. With our delegation's persuasive diplomatic skills, [From.GetName] decides to provide some rifles and ammunition to support our cause."
ets.9.a: "A good start"

ets.10.t: "No Support From [From.GetName]"
ets.10.d: "Bad news. The [From.GetAdjective] government shunned our delegation, seeing us as not worth the effort. This shatters any hopes of gaining support from them."
ets.10.a: "They will pay for this insolence later"

ets.11.t: "East Turkestan Requests More Equipment"
ets.11.d: "Another delegation from East Turkestan has arrived today, informing us that they are in need of more weapons to fight against their enemies in Xinjiang. We should be wary of investing too heavily into them."

ets.15.a: "Thank you [From.GetName]!"

ets.16.t: "East Turkestan Declaration of Independence"
ets.16.d: "With the struggle for control of our nation's lands won, but the powers that be still largely hesitant, the decision was made to issue a new declaration of independence aimed at the outside world. In the document, our great nation promises to respect those nations who respect it and abide by the established norms of international politics. Accompanying the declaration is a directive from the President's office, approved by the state council, that establishes guidelines for the training and allocation of bureaucrats and establishes a system of examinations inspired by the bureaucracy of New Delhi. It also ends the state of emergency enacted alongside the nation's founding to pursue the war for independence, effectively bringing back into session the previously suspended parliament appointed so long ago in our earlier struggles.\n\nFinally, we are free of Chinese control in our region, and we can live independent of their actions. However, it most likely won't be long until the troops from China come marching back to bring us back under their tyranny. We cannot let that happen."
ets.16.a: "Allahu Akbar!"
ets.17.t: "Legislative Stalemate"
ets.17.d: "While critics posit that little power is afforded to the directly elected legislature, the latest session affords little doubt to the President's office that far too much power has been invested in it. After several hours of grueling debate, in which physical violence nearly broke out on the floor of the interim parliament building, Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki, though still officially not a member of any political party, has all but abandoned his political benefactors in Hotan, the Bughras, for the more moderate Young Kashgar Party based in Kashgar city, led by Timur Beg."
ets.17.a: "A Shocking Development."
ets.18.t: "Swirling Rumors and a Grand Reception"
ets.18.d: "Since the defection of President Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki towards the Young Kashgar Party, the faction led by the Hotan Amirs has become increasingly belligerent. As preparations have begun, spurred by the President himself, to hold a Pan-Islamic (and particularly Turkic) forum in Kashgar for leading intellectuals in the field, the Hotan faction has shown an increased disinterest in the process and in the legislature as a whole. Rumors abound that they are planning something terrible."
ets.18.a: "Surely They Would Not..."

ets.19.t: "A Grand Affair"
ets.19.d: "The Pan-Islamic conference that Sabit Damulla planned has been fully prepared and several hundred attendees have arrived in Kashgar. As they crowd into the old manor, Sabit Damulla and Timur Beg stand before them. The conference was opened with a speech by the President, where he spoke about how the key cornerstone to the nation is it’s connection to Islam. After he was finished speaking, cheers were heard across the room.\n\nSomething wasn't right, however. Once the conference has gotten well and truly under way, a loud crack is heard by all..."
ets.19.a: "Oh No."

ets.20.t: "A Night to Remember"
ets.20.d: "Outside the manor house where the conference is under way, a group of armed men stand in a tight circle, the tension so thick in the air even the dumbest dullard can feel its' oppressive hand. Two are within the circle, one on his knees, the other a guard, pushing a gun onto the kneeling man’s temple. The guard, the only guard there whose lifeblood did not yet spill onto the earth has Muhammad Amin Bughra at his mercy, surrounded by Bughra’s men. To pull the trigger would mean the guards life, to surrender would likewise lead him to paradise. Bughra urges his men to continue onwards and slay that bastard Timur and his new lapdog, even if the guard kills him, though they are unlikely to comply should their master be killed. In the end, the guard makes his choice..."
ets.20.a: "The Trigger is pulled, the men disperse."
ets.20.b: "The men head inside, swords drawn."

ets.200.t: "The Kashgar Conference"
ets.200.desc_1: "A small conference of Islamic and Turkic nations was put on by the new government of East Turkestan. Though we sent no official diplomatic delegation, a number of our intellectuals attended the event and have returned with an affinity for the regime in Kashgar."
ets.200.desc_2: "A small conference of Islamic nations was put on by the new government of East Turkestan. Though we sent no official diplomatic delegation, a number of our intellectuals attended the event. While the conference went smoothly at first, it quickly became the focal point of a coup. Our intellectuals were subjected to a gruesome bloodbath and have returned home with a great apprehension for the new regime in Hotan despite its calls for Islamic unity."
ets.200.a: "Allah is Truly the Greatest Planner"
ets.201.t: "My Republic for a Horse"
ets.201.d: "After a short disruption the conference continued. Several bodies were discovered upon investigation around the exterior, including that of the unruly Muhammad Amin Bughra. Many people at the conference were shocked to find such violence to have occurred, but to Timur, it was different. To Timur, it was as if Allah had slain his greatest foe and laid him before his feet. With his death, opposition to Timur's power is minimal and his consolidation will surely follow. To end the conference, President Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki announced that he is stepping down, to be replaced by Timur Beg."
ets.201.a: "The End of the Beginning."

ets.202.t: "The Return of the Bughras"
ets.202.d: "By the time the first screams sounded from the manor, Amin Bughra had already kicked out the feet of the guard holding him and turned the tables. Assessing the situation, he entered the house to find a wonderfully gruesome scene. Bodies lay everywhere, many with their heads removed from their necks, including that of Timur Beg and his closest allies. Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki had apparently fled the scene on a horse he had tied by a back door.\n\nWithin days, the Hotan Amirs, with the eldest, Muhammad Amin, at the forefront, had formed a new government in the city of Hotan, declared to become the new capital. While the constitution has been maintained, the new government will likely disregard what few protections it offers."
ets.202.a: "For the Faith and the People!"

ets.21.t: "Difficult Choices"
ets.21.d: "With the Hotan faction almost completely destroyed following the death of Mohammad Amin Bughra, opposition to Timur Beg almost disappeared overnight. However, opponents still exists, but this time from a different group. Fearful of Timur Beg's consolidation of power, several of the petty nobility have approached the statesman Masud Sabri, in charge of his own political faction, to intervene, pledging their support against Timur. Masud Sabri is a far less eccentric and reasonable figure than Timur Beg, and many of the petty nobility worry Timur's consolidation of power might eventually lead to their own downfall, Sabri included. Sabri is hesitant about making a move and fears, given his known sympathies for certain Chinese factions, including the right-wing of the Kuomintang, will lead to their moving against him in turn."
ets.21.a: "A Plan is Created."
ets.21.b: "Sabri Refuses."

ets.22.t: "Another Disaster"
ets.22.d: "Yet another public event has come under attack in East Turkestan. What began as a military parade became a tense standoff as members of the army held the President, Timur Beg, hostage before the gathered crowd. Their conviction is not entirely certain however as Timur pleads with them to spare him in exchange for amnesty. Seeing the man so affected by the incident, it is clear that should he survive, the character of Timur's rule will take a much more authoritarian turn."
ets.22.a: "Timur is captured, the plot succeeds."
ets.22.b: "The soldiers give in and their leaders are given up."

ets.23.t: "A Grand Affair"
ets.23.d: "A planned military parade in Kashgar went off without a hitch. The people saw the power of the East Turkestan army, and the strength of Timur Beg's rule. Afterwards, Timur held a speech, outlining his plans for the future, including future presidential elections and working with business leaders to create a real economy. With this extravagent show of power concluded, President Timur Beg can now turn his attention to the affairs of state."
ets.23.a: "He Shall Win Great Glory"

ets.24.t: "A Piece of the Puzzle"
ets.24.d: "With the state secured, the Bughra Amirs have turned their attention to the widespread corruption encouraged under previous leadership. Under the premise of establishing a bureaucracy from the ground up, nepotism was rife in administrative appointments. All who received positions above their station, and who likely remain disloyal, shall be removed and future appointments picked through merit alone in a system informed by the Sunnah."
ets.24.a: "Alhamdulillah!"
ets.25.t: "The Will Of Allah"
ets.25.d: "After the Bughra's were able to gain power in our Republic, one question remains on their minds. It is the question of whether the nation must focus on developing itself first, as a true and independent Islamic nation first, or whether it is immediately time to reach out and create stronger ties with the other Turkic nations of the world. The lofty pan-Turkic agenda is massive, and the question to whether we have enough resources for such an outward approach is on the minds of most intellectuals."
ets.25.a: "We Must Focus Internally, for Islam. Alhamdulillah!"
ets.25.b: "We Must Focus Externally, for Pan-Turkism."

ets.26.t: "The Sun Rises in the East"
ets.26.d: "Masud Sabri and Isa Alptekin both possess ties throughout China and are accordingly generally friendlier towards the Chinese and Tugans than the general Turkic populace. While Alptekin does not go so far, Masud Sabri has laid bare his intention to pursue formal diplomatic relations with whichever Chinese regimes would prove friendly. Though Sabri at first attempted to keep the public generally on his side, it appears now with this announcement this may be completely impossible. Naturally, many are uneasy about Sabri's government, and small protests now regularly break out in front of government offices."
ets.26.a: "And We Shall Follow the Sun."

ets.27.t: "Popular Demands"
ets.27.d: "For over a fortnight now, massive protests have continued throughout the major cities of the nation, focused on the capital, Kashgar. The generally uninformed populace of East Turkestan have been angered by Sabri's plan to seek closer relations with the Chinese, who most Turkic people still see as their former oppressors. Alptekin, Sabri's coalition partner, has resigned from the coalition, stating that for now it is time for Sabri to resign, to be replaced by Alptekin of course, and so that proper elections can be held as to who the people want. Not only this, the socialist leader of the Young Turkestan Party, Ishaq Bey, has come out of the woodwork, and has started gathering support in the cities. If Sabri does not step down, it is clear his rule from now will be just as dictatorial as Timur Beg's could have ever been."
ets.27.a: "Sabri Steps Down."
ets.27.b: "Sabri Remains."

ets.28.t: "A Republic of Inequals"
ets.28.d: "Masud Sabri has promised little change with his ascension in Timur's place, but his rotation of certain bureaucrats and friendliness towards certain factions within the army tell a different story. Desperate to maintain popular support, Sabri has reached out to the young upstart Isa Alptekin and his Kashgar Nationalist Party to form a coalition government. Alptekin, a moderate who shares Sabri's more friendly approach towards China,has vowed to fix the fundamental ails of the new republic's political structure and institute regular national elections, something absent entirely from the nation's founding document."
ets.28.a: "The Least Bad System."

ets.29.t: "Timur Shah"
ets.29.d: "Timur is famous for being an eccentric and controversial figure. He has wished for a crown, a sign of his ultimate leadership over East Turkestan, and today his wish has become reality. His power unchallenged, Timur Beg has now taken the name Timur Shah, and has declared himself Shah of East Turkestan, drawing up a modified constitution to confirm the arrangement. This announcement and crowning as Shah went down with great cheers from the crowd."
ets.29.a: "He Rules By Allah's Will."
#ets.30.t: "Plot Foiled"
#ets.30.d: "A small number of men within the upper echelons of government, incensed by their marginalisation, were implicated in a plot to assassinate King Timur. They have been punished according to Allah's laws and Timur, fearing for his life, has decreed a renewed state of emergency, suspending the legislature entirely."
#ets.30.a: "Hail Timur!"

ets.31.t: "Assessing The Desert"
ets.31.d: "As the first step towards building sufficient infrastructure across the Taklamakan desert is to properly survey the region and identify suitable terrain for infrastructure projects like railways and telegraph lines. It will be an incredibly difficult task, as the region is mostly a harsh desert wasteland."
ets.31.a: "Get To It!"

ets.32.t: "Construction Begins in the Desert"
ets.32.d: "With the region assessed, our grand infrastructure project for the Taklamakan desert can begin. It will likely take a few months to complete, even with the immense funding granted, due to the immense size of the project and the brutality of the work required."
ets.32.a: "It Can't Be Finished Soon Enough."

ets.33.t: "Desert Projects Completed"
ets.33.d: "The project to improve infrastructure crossing the Taklamakan desert has been completed, with Muhammad Amin Bughra himself opening up the start of the railway in Hotan. It will massively improve the connectivity of the surrounding regions, and help create unity across the still divided nation."
ets.33.a: "Excellent."

ets.34.t: "Dealing With the Tungans"
ets.34.d: "With preparations made, the Tungan Question must be addressed. The Tungans are the large ethnic group in East Turkestan, and though they are muslim, they are firmly Chinese, and are very closely aligned with the Chinese states. While a program of assimilation will undoubtedly be passed, and one which heavily restricts the Chinese language has been drafted, the question of deportations, sought by many in our government has caused much debate. While ultimately deporting Tungan populations in areas of strategic importance may provide some benefit, it would also deprive the army of much-needed manpower, and created sizable dissadent populations abroad, all at a substantial cost."
ets.34.a: "Deport From Critical Areas, Assimilation for the others."
ets.34.b: "Assimilation Will Be Enough"

ets.35.t: "Initial Deportations"
ets.35.d: "Populations near major cities and along strategic positions have been assessed and thousands of Tungans have been rounded up and marched towards the west, bound for Qinghai. There was much resistance to this from the populations being deported, however overall it all went as well as expected."
ets.35.a: "We Are Not Done Yet!"

ets.350.t: "Refugees from the East"
ets.350.d: "The new government in charge of East Turkestan, formerly the Chinese province of Xinjiang, is extremely brutal and anti-Chinese in every way. Just recently, flocks of refugees, driven from East Turkestan proper, have arrived in Qinghai, stating they were forced out by the East Turkestan military. Around fifty thousand in total have arrived and settled in the city, mostly of Hui ethnicity."
ets.350.a: "An Interesting Development"

ets.36.t: "Signs Converted"
ets.36.d: "As part of the first phase of the assimilation program, all signs across the country in Chinese have been converted to standard Chagatay script, both in private and public places. All, even the most far-flung villagers, have been made aware of prohibition on Chinese and the consequences of defying the law."
ets.36.a: "More Is Yet To Come!"

ets.37.t: "Second Round of Deportations"
ets.37.d: "The remaining Tungans from within those areas earmarked for deportations have been rounded up. This time, they will be marched towards Gansu."
ets.37.a: "At last, our lands are secure."

ets.370.t: "Refugees from the East"
ets.370.d: "Flocks of refugees, driven from East Turkestan proper, have arrived in northern Gansu. Around twenty thousand in total, they are mostly Hui."
ets.370.a: "An Interesting Development"
ets.370.b: "Our people humiliated. This means war."

ets.38.t: "Growing Proficiency"
ets.38.d: "Our assimilation policy is well under way. While it will be years before demographics and identities change, we are on our way there. Public life at least, has been sufficiently Turkified. No longer will we be though of as another rebellious province of Beijing. Now, we are truly Turkic."
ets.38.a: "Allah Willing!"
ets.39.t: "The National Language"
ets.39.d: "We must unite the many Turkic dialects of East Turkestan. To that end, a standard language used by the intelligensia of Central Asia has been proposed. Based on the Chagatay language as spoken in Tashkent, its adoption will also undoubtedly draw us closer yet to our Turkic brothers."
ets.39.a: "It will be a long process"

ets.40.t: "Language Standard Disseminated"
ets.40.d: "A set of standards and rules for the use of language have been drafted and disseminated across the country. Our desired linguistic reforms are now being propagated."
ets.40.a: "We shall be one people"

ets.41.t: "Success of Language Standardisation"
ets.41.d: "While obviously it shall be some time yet before the new unified language overcomes the old, the new standard speach can now be heard on every street as people are made to adopt it in public or face punishment."
ets.41.a: "Wonderful!"

Today, however, [ROOT.GetLeader] received their diplomats officially for the first time, in an official ceremony in which we recognised their government as the legitmate government of the area.

ets.54.t: "East Turkestan Wants to Send Officers for Training"

Their government has sent a request to ours, asking that our military train some of their officers, to make their army more ready to defend the state against /"enemies from both without and within/".

ets.54.b: "We don't have the supplies."

 ets.55.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses!"

ets.58.t: "The Pickle King of Tartary"
ets.58.d: "With our war effort against the Chinese going less than smoothly, we have become desperate for any help we can get. It would be just our luck that a few years ago, the English pickle manufacturer Bertie William Sheldrake converted to Islam and moved to our lands, working with local tribes and being declared king of the small and unrecognized state of Islamestan. Here, he has ruled by many names, such as the English Emir of Kashgar, the Lord of the Rooftop of the World, and the Suburban King of Tartary, and has amassed a small but loyal following. Among his retinue is a highly trained group of mercenary guerillas, all armed with advanced British weaponry and supplies brought to these wastes by the Pickle King Khalid Sheldrake, as Bertie now calls himself. In order to secure these veterans for our own efforts, we have moved to give Khalid Sheldrake an official military command within our army, and have moved to recognize his little emirate and agree to some levels of autonomy in order to secure his loyalty. He may be mad, but at least he has some use."
ets.58.a: "We will humor this Pickle King if it will help our cause."

ets.70.t: "Committee for National Revolution"
ets.70.d: "The legitimate government of East Turkestan, the Committee for National Revolution, led by a Jadidist Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki, has approached our government with a request to host their government in-exile in Turkestan."

ets.70.b: "We won't recognize them!"

ets.71.t: "The Split in the East Turkestan Émigré"
ets.71.d: "Following the assumption of control over the government in exile of East Turkestan, internal divisions began to erode the unity of the group. Despite the leadership of Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki, who maintained a non-partisan stance, the opposition gained the upper hand, prompting the president to step down from his position.\n\nIn the ensuing power vacuum, a bitter power struggle ensued, with the leaders of the exiled government seeking support from various political factions within our own country. Following protracted discussions and a confrontation that nearly escalated into physical violence, largely facilitated by the intervention of our government, we succeeded in convincing the exiles to endorse..."
ets.71.a: "Ishaq Bey, the leader of the socialist Young Turkestan Party."
ets.71.b: "Masud Sabri, a Jadidist-oriented statesman."
ets.71.c: "Muhammad Amin Bughra, an Islamist from Young Kashkar Party."

ets.102.t: "The Old Foe Finally Slain"
ets.102.d: "Starting off with our backs to the sandy dunes of the Taklimakan Desert, our proud warriors fought ferociously, and with Allah on our side, we have finally prevailed! From the lands of the Uyghurs to the heartland of the Han themselves, all of the Middle Kingdom now lies under our control. We own China, and now the fate of millions rests in our hands. We must decide on the nature of our new Islamic state so that we may begin reorganizing the nation to fit our needs and desires, so let us be quick so that Allah’s divine light may shine across all China!"

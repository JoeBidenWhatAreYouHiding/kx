### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_AMIN_BUGHRA_DESC:0 "The early life of Muhammad Amin Burha is shouded in mystery, with scant clues alluding to him teaching at a Madrassa prior to his military serivce. Amin Burgha's background as a Jadidist and a Turk granted him few luxuries, even under Ma Shaowu's governance in Hotan. Amin Burgha displayed a strong determination to work for Xinjiang's unification, and despised the weak attitude for which Governor Yang kept his garrisons. At the same time, Amin Burgha opposed the Han-centric army reforms being proposed by General Sheng Shicai, which placed the blame for army mismanagement on Islam rather than the opium epidemic."
POLITICS_SABIT_DAMULLA_ABDULBAKI_DESC:0 "Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki never expected to be the face of the Turkic nationalist movement in Xinjiang. A highly educated academic and journalist, Abdulbaki has corresponded with several of the world's most prominent living Jadidist scholars. Through Jadid circles, he became acquainted with prominent members of the East Turkestan nationalist movement, including the wealthy aristocrat Muhammad Amin Bughra, and through Bughra the wider nationalist movement. Due to his pleasant demeanor, pragamatic viewpoint, and fluency in several languages, the often at-odds nationalist factions agreed on Damulla to for the role of East Turkestan's first head of state and government. Should East Turkestan secure its bid for independence, it is likely however that Damulla will be subsumed by whichever of the nation's factions comes out on top."

With the people rallying to our side, the revolution is strong!\n\nOur revolution however, is far from secure. Unable to produce proper equipment due to Yang Zengxin's medieval industrial policies, our untrained irregulars stand little chance against the armies of Ma Shaowu and Jin Shuren without decisive political action. Our forces will need to be reformed if we are to have any hope of success, and we should try to act in the creation of military factories.\n\nPolitically, our new nation is in some ways united and in others divided completely. The eccentric Timur Beg, a veteran merchant leader and member of the local nobility near Kashgar, has taken the reigns of the Young Kashgar Party with his native city of Kashgar as their base of power. Meanwhile, the three siblings amirs of Hotan, the brutal Bughras, made wealthy through ownership of several profitable mining ventures, lead their forces from Hotan. Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki, a moderate western-educated general, has been appointed interim president. Though he is not an actual member of any party or faction, he garners most of his support from the Hotan based Bughras. However, many see Sabit Damulla as a unifying figure to the rebellion, who helps ease the tensions between the merchant of Kashgar and the Bughra brothers."

In the document, our great nation promises to respect those nations who respect it and abide by the established norms of international politics. Accompanying the declaration is a directive from the President's office, approved by the state council, that establishes guidelines for the training and allocation of bureaucrats and establishes a system of examinations inspired by the bureaucracy of New Delhi. It also ends the state of emergency enacted alongside the nation's founding to pursue the war for independence, effectively bringing back into session the previously suspended parliament appointed so long ago in our earlier struggles.\n\nFinally, we are free of Chinese control in our region, and we can live independent of their actions. However, it most likely won't be long until the troops from China come marching back to bring us back under their tyranny. We cannot let that happen."

As preparations have begun, spurred by the President himself, to hold a Pan-Islamic (and particularly Turkic) forum in Kashgar for leading intellectuals in the field, the Hotan faction has shown an increased disinterest in the process and in the legislature as a whole.

The conference was opened with a speech by the President, where he spoke about how the key cornerstone to the nation is it’s connection to Islam. After he was finished speaking, cheers were heard across the room.\n\nSomething wasn't right, however. Once the conference has gotten well and truly under way, a loud crack is heard by all..."

ets.20.d:0 "Outside the manor house where the conference is under way, a group of armed men stand in a tight circle, the tension so thick in the air even the dumbest dullard can feel its' oppressive hand. Two are within the circle, one on his knees, the other a guard, pushing a gun onto the kneeling man’s temple. The guard, the only guard there whose lifeblood did not yet spill onto the earth has Muhammad Amin Bughra at his mercy, surrounded by Bughra’s men. To pull the trigger would mean the guards life, to surrender would likewise lead him to paradise. Bughra urges his men to continue onwards and slay that bastard Timur and his new lapdog, even if the guard kills him, though they are unlikely to comply should their master be killed. In the end, the guard makes his choice..."

Many people at the conference were shocked to find such violence to have occurred, but to Timur, it was different. To Timur, it was as if Allah had slain his greatest foe and laid him before his feet. With his death, opposition to Timur's power is minimal and his consolidation will surely follow.

Assessing the situation, he entered the house to find a wonderfully gruesome scene. Bodies lay everywhere, many with their heads removed from their necks, including that of Timur Beg and his closest allies. Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki had apparently fled the scene on a horse he had tied by a back door.\n\nWithin days, the Hotan Amirs, with the eldest, Muhammad Amin, at the forefront, had formed a new government in the city of Hotan, declared to become the new capital. While the constitution has been maintained, the new government will likely disregard what few protections it offers."

However, opponents still exists, but this time from a different group. Fearful of Timur Beg's consolidation of power, several of the petty nobility have approached the statesman Masud Sabri, in charge of his own political faction, to intervene, pledging their support against Timur. Masud Sabri is a far less eccentric and reasonable figure than Timur Beg, and many of the petty nobility worry Timur's consolidation of power might eventually lead to their own downfall, Sabri included. Sabri is hesitant about making a move and fears, given his known sympathies for certain Chinese factions, including the right-wing of the Kuomintang, will lead to their moving against him in turn."

Their conviction is not entirely certain however as Timur pleads with them to spare him in exchange for amnesty. Seeing the man so affected by the incident, it is clear that should he survive, the character of Timur's rule will take a much more authoritarian turn."

It is the question of whether the nation must focus on developing itself first, as a true and independent Islamic nation first, or whether it is immediately time to reach out and create stronger ties with the other Turkic nations of the world. The lofty pan-Turkic agenda is massive, and the question to whether we have enough resources for such an outward approach is on the minds of most intellectuals."

While Alptekin does not go so far, Masud Sabri has laid bare his intention to pursue formal diplomatic relations with whichever Chinese regimes would prove friendly. Though Sabri at first attempted to keep the public generally on his side, it appears now with this announcement this may be completely impossible.

The generally uninformed populace of East Turkestan have been angered by Sabri's plan to seek closer relations with the Chinese, who most Turkic people still see as their former oppressors. Alptekin, Sabri's coalition partner, has resigned from the coalition, stating that for now it is time for Sabri to resign, to be replaced by Alptekin of course, and so that proper elections can be held as to who the people want. Not only this, the socialist leader of the Young Turkestan Party, Ishaq Bey, has come out of the woodwork, and has started gathering support in the cities. If Sabri does not step down, it is clear his rule from now will be just as dictatorial as Timur Beg's could have ever been."

Desperate to maintain popular support, Sabri has reached out to the young upstart Isa Alptekin and his Kashgar Nationalist Party to form a coalition government. Alptekin, a moderate who shares Sabri's more friendly approach towards China,has vowed to fix the fundamental ails of the new republic's political structure and institute regular national elections, something absent entirely from the nation's founding document."

While a program of assimilation will undoubtedly be passed, and one which heavily restricts the Chinese language has been drafted, the question of deportations, sought by many in our government has caused much debate. While ultimately deporting Tungan populations in areas of strategic importance may provide some benefit, it would also deprive the army of much-needed manpower, and created sizable dissadent populations abroad, all at a substantial cost."

ets.38.d:0 "Our assimilation policy is well under way. While it will be years before demographics and identities change, we are on our way there.

ets.38.a:0 "Allah Willing!"
ets.39.t:0 "The National Language"
ets.39.d:0 "We must unite the many Turkic dialects of East Turkestan. To that end, a standard language used by the intelligensia of Central Asia has been proposed. Based on the Chagatay language as spoken in Tashkent, its adoption will also undoubtedly draw us closer yet to our Turkic brothers."

ets.47.a:0 "A Worthwhile Investment"
ets.48.t:0 "Acquiring Planes"

Today, however, [ROOT.GetLeader] received their diplomats officially for the first time, in an official ceremony in which we recognised their government as the legitmate government of the area. After some discussions a treaty of friendship and co-operation was signed, agreeing to aid each other in times of need."

ets.54.t:0 "East Turkestan Wants to Send Officers for Training"
ets.54.d:0 "The new state of East Turkestan has recently grown closer with out government, and it seems the plans for co-operation have been realised. Their government has sent a request to ours, asking that our military train some of their officers, to make their army more ready to defend the state against /"enemies from both without and within/". The supply costs, though small, could be a justification to refuse them."

ets.58.t:0 "The Pickle King of Tartary"
ets.58.d:0 "With our war effort against the Chinese going less than smoothly, we have become desperate for any help we can get. It would be just our luck that a few years ago, the English pickle manufacturer Bertie William Sheldrake converted to Islam and moved to our lands, working with local tribes and being declared king of the small and unrecognized state of Islamestan. Here, he has ruled by many names, such as the English Emir of Kashgar, the Lord of the Rooftop of the World, and the Suburban King of Tartary, and has amassed a small but loyal following. Among his retinue is a highly trained group of mercenary guerillas, all armed with advanced British weaponry and supplies brought to these wastes by the Pickle King Khalid Sheldrake, as Bertie now calls himself. In order to secure these veterans for our own efforts, we have moved to give Khalid Sheldrake an official military command within our army, and have moved to recognize his little emirate and agree to some levels of autonomy in order to secure his loyalty. He may be mad, but at least he has some use."

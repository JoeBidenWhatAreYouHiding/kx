gerfla.9.t:0 "Unser Kampf"
gerfla.9.d:0 "The Propylӓen Verlag subdivision of the Ullstein Verlag publishing house has announced its intention to release a new series of books devoted to stories, accounts, and poetry by individual German soldiers that served throughout the various theatres of the Weltkrieg, titled 'Unser Kampf' or ‘Our Struggle’. Notable examples of works and writings drawn from include the diaries of famous figures such as Ernst Jünger and Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, as well as the memoirs of lesser personas, such as that of corporal Adolf Hitler - a signalman who amongst other distinctions was awarded no less than two Iron Crosses for his valor on both the Western and Eastern fronts before being slain in 1918 at the hands of British soldier Henry Tandey. The diaries provide a unique and fiery insight into the nature of a bitter ideological struggle while honoring fallen heroes and showcasing the tragic heroism and horrors that war truly brings in a personal and intimate portrayal straight from the front. What better way to reaffirm the values and continuing glory of the Kaiserreich while also shining light on the grim realities of world war in these troubled times?"
gerfla.9.a:0 "A good read!"

gerfla.10.t:0 "Unser Kampf: The Movie"
gerfla.10.d:0 "Following the widespread popularity of the bestselling series produced by Propyläen Verlag, film director wunderkind Leni Riefenstahl resolved to turn the material into a movie based on the accounts given. 'Unser Kampf' boasts the highest production values hitherto seen - made possible by state investments into the Babelsberg studios - and offers a frighteningly real and morbid, although simultaneously glorified, depiction of the war. Starring Heinz Ruhmann, Hans Albers, Theodor Loos, and Marlene Dietrich, among others, the story focuses on the heroism and dedication of the 'small people' in the Weltkrieg, such as young fighter aces like Heinrich Gontermann, Hans-Joachim Buddecke, Max Immelmann, Oswald Boelcke, and Adolf Ritter von Tutschek that tragically died in the line of duty or people like the decorated corporal and signalman Adolf Hitler - being played by his own living nephew William Patrick Hitler; together who all sacrificed everything for their Kaiser and the Reich in the mud of Marcoing and other battlefields across Europe and the wider globe. May this film and others like it, such as the soon to be released ‘Metropolis’ and the previously-released ‘SOS Eisberg’ and ‘Das Blaue Licht’, continue to progress contemporary German cinema and art while also hopefully drumming up more patriotic fervor and support among the masses."
gerfla.10.a:0 "A stellar movie!"

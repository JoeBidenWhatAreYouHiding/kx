OTT_german_military_command:0 "The Shadow Cabinet"
OTT_german_military_command_desc:0 "Our oriental allies have once again disappointed us. We are now the only ones who can save them from decline and destruction, we have forced the Sultan to appoint a puppet government composed of loyal bureaucrats, but it is our Military Mission that will truly rule the Empire from the shadows for the time being."

OTT_transfer_of_suez:0 "Transfer of the Suez Canal"
OTT_transfer_of_suez_desc:0 "The Suez Canal is officially owned by Germany to protect their intercontinental and maritime interests. With the Mission standing behind the government we can make sure that the Canal is in safe hands, by making a formal request to transfer the canal from Fatherland to the Ottomans under our control, our Military Mission will be able to protect it from any enemy who would attempt to undermine German hegemony over the world."

OTT_mittelafrikan_business_ties:0 "Mittelafrikan Trade and Business"
OTT_mittelafrikan_business_ties_desc:0 "Africa is home to many treasures and opportunities that could satiate our needs. With friendly German administration in Mittelafrika, the world of commerce and trade is wide open. Through this process we will boost the capabilities of Ottoman civil and military industries, making the Ottoman contribution as an ally of the Empire more useful, and the creation of new jobs will make the populations more docile."

OTT_obtain_german_support:0 "Petition the Reichswirtschaftsministerium"
OTT_obtain_german_support_desc:0 "The Ottoman coffers are no longer as full as they used to be during their Golden Age in the 16th Century. Let's make a secret request for funds to the Reichswirtschaftsministerium of the Fatherland, hoping that they will grant us the funds necessary to carry out our mission."

OTT_hide_our_influence:0 "A Thickened Veil"
OTT_hide_our_influence_desc:0 "It is our top priority to continue to conceal the fact that the German Military Mission is effectively running the Ottoman Empire, our officers must not be seen making government decisions by the public, all our meetings will be secret and our meeting locations will be constantly changing. The survival of our mandate in the Middle East depends on our absolute discretion."

OTT_find_turkish_dissidents:0 "Eliminate Dissident Intellectuals"
OTT_find_turkish_dissidents_desc:0 "Some sneaky intellectuals and overly curious journalists suspect that something is wrong with the current governance of the Empire, seeing well that this abrupt change of government was suspicious. Discreetly arresting or 'disappearing' all these enemies of Germany to prevent their theses from spreading among the population should be amongst our top priorities."

OTT_ease_religion:0 "Get the Religious Minorities on Our Side"
OTT_ease_religion_desc:0 "The rule of Islam is well established in these lands, however many minorities inhabit this vast Empire, in order to ensure that they will be on our side if things go wrong, we must give them more rights to practice their faith and get rid of the archaic laws that discriminate against them."

OTT_crackdown_nationalists:0 "An End to the Kemalist Remnants"
OTT_crackdown_nationalists_desc:0 "The Kemalists are the opposite of what we are trying to build here, these Turkish nationalists have already infiltrated the army and institutions far too much, the only solution to this problem is a precise and effective purge against these tumors to our mission."

OTT_new_ottoman_army:0 "The Birth of the Osmanisches Heer"
OTT_new_ottoman_army_desc:0 "The Ottoman Army is archaic and ineffective, the takeover of our Military Mission is the ultimate proof of this. It is high time to organize a major reorganization of this army in order to truly make it a 20th century army, we will model it on the Deutsches Heer and we will be inspired by the famous Prussian techniques that made our Empire win the Weltkrieg in the first place."

OTT_encourage_german_investment:0 "Encourage German Investors"
OTT_encourage_german_investment_desc:0 "The Ottoman economy is in dire need of foreign help, we should entice German businessmen to invest into our new economy. Whether it is a medium-sized company or a large conglomerate, each German capital will be one more stone in the great edifice that we are building in these eastern lands. The Ottoman Empire will certainly not equal Germany, but it will come as close as possible."

OTT_silence_sultan:0 "Keep the Sultan Under Watch"
OTT_silence_sultan_desc:0 "We have so far managed to control the Sultan and ensure that he does not say a word about what is really happening in Constantinople, however we cannot be too careful. We will ensure that each of his movements and speeches are strictly supervised by loyal officers, this will ensure that the Sultan does not do anything that could arouse even an ounce of doubt."

OTT_establish_german_military_presence:0 "Request Reinforcements From the Fatherland"
OTT_establish_german_military_presence_desc:0 "Although our experience of war in this land of the Middle East is obviously not to be underestimated, our limited numbers could well be a significant weakness of the Military Mission. We will request the transfer of reservists and experts from Germany to the Ottoman Empire. Among them we can count the archaeologist, orientalist, patron and spy Max von Oppenheim, a baron expert on the Orient. As well as Johann von Leers, also known as Omar Amin, author of philo-Islamist and anti-Semitic theses. Their experiences will undoubtedly be useful to us in administering this vast Empire."

OTT_modernize_turkey:0 "Modernize Ottoman Living Conditions"
OTT_modernize_turkey_desc:0 "A large part of the Ottoman population lives in archaic conditions, straight out of the 18th century, or even worse, especially in rural areas. These populations are not very useful to the cause of German hegemony if they can neither read nor write, it is high time to remedy that. Let us take up the modernization programs of the governments that preceded us, adapt them to our interests and apply them everywhere in the Empire."

OTT_reforged_turkey:0 "Reforged in Iron and Blood"
OTT_reforged_turkey_desc:0 "We have managed what generations of bureaucrats, politicians, elites and sultans never could. The Sick Man of Europe is finally on the right path, towards glory days. It is now high time to put an end to this shadow government and restore a true system of governance in the Empire, while ensuring that it remains aligned with German interests of course."

OTT_heia_safari:0 "The Kaiser’s Jihad"
OTT_heia_safari_desc:0 "So much could have been achieved if the German Empire and the Ottoman Empire had stayed close after the Weltkrieg, but unfortunately these traitors preferred to turn their backs on us. It's high time to rectify the mistakes of the past, Max von Oppenheim will be ordered to recreate the 'Jihad Bureau' he formed during the Weltkrieg, playing on the Islamist sentiments of the local population to better control, appease and redirect them towards Germany's enemies. We'll also be deepening our plans for industrial expansion and railroad construction, to turn the former Ottoman Empire into Germany's colonial jewel."

OTT_germany_in_middle_east:0 "A Germany in the Middle East"
OTT_germany_in_middle_east_desc:0 "The victory of the German Empire over the liberal French and British regimes and the backward Russian autocrats is proof that our political system is the better of the two worlds. The Ottoman Empire, unfortunately, is stuck in a system that has barely been modernized since the Renaissance. Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and his modernizing allies have set out to reform this decadent system, basing their projects on the triumphant Fatherland, with the aim of recreating an Ottoman Golden Age of which Suleiman the Magnificent himself would surely be proud."

OTT_german_institutions:0 "The Dawn of Ottoman Constitutionalism"
OTT_german_institutions_desc:0 "The system of 'Prussian constitutionalism' applied in the Kaiserreich is undoubtedly the most important element of the German political system, a semi-constitutional monarchy ensuring representation of the people and aristocratic interests, while supporting the Sovereign's position without making him an autocrat. Let's apply these principles to the Ottoman Empire, by creating different kingdoms from the Vilayets, for example, and creating an upper and lower house adapted to our situation, while amending the constitution as required."

OTT_our_own_empire:0 "An Empire to Call Our Own"
OTT_our_own_empire_desc:0 "We're tired of staying in the shadows! We are the saviours of the Ottoman Empire and its people, we have defended their lives with our blood and begun to modernize their so-called 'Empire', it's high time to dismantle the 'provisional government' and assert that the German Military Mission is now in command."

OTT_trust_ambassador:0 "Trust in the Ambassador"
OTT_trust_ambassador_desc:0 "The provisional government can not last forever, and many Ottomans are suspecting that something is amiss. It is high time to recommend that the Sultan appoint a new government. The German diplomat and ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, supported by certain liberals, including a large part of the Democratic Party, put himself forward for the post of Grand Vizier, hoping to modernize the institutions of the Ottoman Empire by modeling them on the German model."

OTT_trust_elites:0 "A Job for Their Elites"
OTT_trust_elites_desc:0 "Our initial mission is coming to an end, we've secured the Empire's borders militarily and solved its immediate problems, it's time to leave governance to the Ottomans. However, giving it to the dangerous Kemalist reformers or the suicidal decentralists is out of the question, so we must call on the former Grand Vizier and Ottoman ambassador to Germany, Ahmet Tevfik Pasha. With the support of the Ottoman elite, this man will undoubtedly be able to keep the Empire together, while aligning it with our interests. Let's recommend him to the Sultan as soon as possible."

OTT_force_sultans_hand:0 "The Perfect Puppet"
OTT_force_sultans_hand_desc:0 "We have no love for Abdülmecid II, but he proved to be a perfect figurehead for us, appeasing the Ottomans as Sultan and the Muslims as Caliph. So let's leave him on his golden throne, still under constant German supervision of course, as his symbolic position alone will ensure a certain form of stability and legitimacy for our reign."

OTT_osmanisches_reich:0 "A New Osmanisches Reich"
OTT_osmanisches_reich_desc:0 "A new era dawns upon the so-called Sick Man of Europe. Through our many efforts we were able to reverse the course of fate and save this decadent empire from decline. Ottomans and Germans now see their destinies linked, just as we won the Weltkrieg together, we will prosper together and this time let us hope it lasts."

OTT_raise_troop_morale:0 "Acclimatize Our Troops to the Al-Ramlah"
OTT_raise_troop_morale_desc:0 "Although a significant portion of our troops have already participated in the Ottoman front during the Weltkrieg, many of our soldiers do not have the same experience of the terrain, climate and conditions of the Middle East. We will launch major training and education campaigns at all levels of our Military Mission, chaired by experienced veterans, with the aim of increasing the morale of our troops and their combat capabilities."

OTT_purchase_new_equipment:0 "New Armaments for a New Age"
OTT_purchase_new_equipment_desc:0 "Apart from the equipment we brought with us from Germany, we have been able to see that a large part of the Ottoman arsenal is in a disastrous state, some rifles even being several centuries old. It is high time to work on a rapid material modernization, and to increase our imports of armaments from German factories."

OTT_damascus_daressalaam_railway:0 "A Railway to Dar-es-Salaam"
OTT_damascus_daressalaam_railway_desc:0 "The time has come to make the grand engineering dream into reality. A Railway from Cairo to Dar-es-Salaam shall be built, such an impressive and extensive project will allow the Ottoman Empire to be connected to the German colonial Empire more efficiently, facilitating trade and troop movements. The riches of Africa and the Orient will contribute to the ever-growing prestige of German power!"

OTT_multicultural_army:0 "Fuse the German and Ottoman Chains of Command"
OTT_multicultural_army_desc:0 "The German Military Mission of General and Ottoman friend Schellendorf was a great help to our Empire when some thought it was going to collapse. It is high time to incorporate the mission into our regular army in order to further improve our military capabilities; this way we will ensure we are ready if any further revolts should break out."

OTT_show_german_overlordship:0 "Work Towards an Equal Partnership"
OTT_show_german_overlordship_desc:0 "We are eternally grateful to our German friends for their great military aid and capital injections into the Empire, but this 'shadow cabinet' must never happen again. We are a proud and independent Empire, with a long and rich history, and we are friends of the Germans, not subjects."

OTT_unity_in_faith:0 "Brothers in Islam"
OTT_unity_in_faith_desc:0 "Our Empire is made up of dozens of different peoples, each with their own specific traditions and customs, and it would be foolish to want to establish Turkish supremacy in the political and cultural sphere, as Kemal wanted. Let's concentrate on the element common to the majority of the Empire, our faith in Islam. With the help of the IMF and religious elites, we will unify our vast Empire behind our government and the Sultan."

OTT_militaristic_nature:0 "Bet on the German Conglomerates"
OTT_militaristic_nature_desc:0 "So far, German investors have made the Empire way more wealthy, why stop there? Let's invite the great German conglomerates, such as Krupp or Siemens, to open up multiple industries and give jobs to our subjects, which will also contribute to the enrichment of the Ottoman aristocrats, a well-deserved reward since the stability of the Empire rests on their shoulders."

OTT_more_than_a_junta:0 "Promote Ottoman-German Businesses"
OTT_more_than_a_junta_desc:0 "There's no doubt that German investors have helped lift our Empire off the economic slope, but we mustn't forget to preserve our independence above all else. Let's encourage our subjects to open their own businesses in cooperation with German companies, allowing economic development to benefit both nations while reducing our dependence on Germany."

OTT_train_our_officers:0 "An Olive Branch to the Liberals"
OTT_train_our_officers_desc:0 "Our big reform projects can't be carried out by the ambassador alone, but fortunately Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff has many connections and friends in the liberal Ottoman political sphere, such as the leader of the Democratic Party, Musa Kazim Pasa himself. With his support, the reforms should be quicker and more popular with the Ottoman population and political elites alike."

OTT_schools_of_sciences:0 "An Empire of Reason"
OTT_schools_of_sciences_desc:0 "The Kemalists were right about one thing: the slow development of the Empire was largely due to its submission to religious dogma. It's high time to begin the process of secularizing the state, replacing dogma with reason and reflection, and funding educational campaigns throughout the Empire, with the aim of educating the minds of tomorrow to do better than their predecessors."

OTT_invite_kaiser:0 "Affirm Our Rule"
OTT_invite_kaiser_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire is no more, at least not as an independent entity, its former lands are now the property of the Kaiser's loyal soldiers that we are. Just as Africa and the Orient were subjugated by our armies, the Middle East will be added to the Fatherland's collection of colonies, and its wealth used to maintain our hegemony over the World for as long as possible."

OTT_affirm_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyal Collaborators"
OTT_affirm_loyalty_desc:0 "It would have been very hard to maintain this German structure of administration of the Ottoman lands without counting our loyal Ottoman subjects as foundations. In order to boost cooperation on the part of the Ottoman peoples, we will grant privileges and rewards to those who prove themselves worthy of being subjects of the Kaiser. We will also ally ourselves with the local tribal monarchs and local religious elites just as we do in Africa to ensure the loyalty of the traditionalist populations."

OTT_civilisation_mission:0 "All for the Civilizing Mission"
OTT_civilisation_mission_desc:0 "The ultimate goal of colonialism is to spread superior Western values in uncivilized lands in order to elevate populations to a level of civilization worthy of Europe and the civilized world. Let us propagate our culture, our ideology and our sciences, because it is our mission to do so, and we intend to fulfill it without fail, whatever the opinion of the terrorists claiming to be so-called 'resistance fighters' to our mission. Our recent military mission and the one which we carried out during the Weltkrieg, led by heroes such as Erich von Falkenhayn and Otto Liman von Sanders, have clearly demonstrated that our presence is necessary to protect these lands and make them prosper."

kxott.1.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire, our old ally in the Weltkrieg, has proposed the resurrection of an alliance between us."
kxott.1.a:0 "Why wouldn't we?"
kxott.1.b:0 "Not today."

kxott.2.t:0 "The Ottomans Wish for Assistance"
kxott.2.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire, our old ally and now ally, has given us a request for equipment, including guns and artillery batteries. Do we give them the equipment, or do they not need it?"
kxott.2.a:0 "Yeah, send them some equipment."
kxott.2.b:0 "They don't need it."

kxott.3.t:0 "Assistance from Germany"
kxott.3.d:0 "Germany, in their endless kindness and benevolence, has bestowed upon us the equipment requested. At last! We will be better able to supply our armies."
kxott.3.a:0 "Hurrah!"

kxott.4.t:0 "No Assistance"
kxott.4.d:0 "Germany has refused our reasonable request for weaponry. We are allies, so we can't really do much except shake our tiny fist at them."
kxott.4.a:0 "Drat."

kxott.5.t:0 "Handing over the Suez Canal"
kxott.5.d:0 "With the German Military Mission firmly in control of the Ottoman Empire, the staff of the Mission have decided to transfer control of the vital Suez Canal to the Kaiserreich. Publicly, this move is justified as a way to repay Germany for both helping us in the recent war with the Cairo Axis and also to pay off remaining debts from the Weltkrieg. Unofficially, the move is a clear attempt to sway those skeptical of the whole Ottoman ordeal back in Berlin."
kxott.5.a:0 "Quid Pro Quo..."

kxott.6.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire Offers up the Suez!"
kxott.6.d:0 "With the recent success of the Ottoman Empire against the Cairo Axis with our aid, the Sultan's government has offered to transfer the Suez Canal to us. To the German public, the move makes little sense. While it is indeed greatly increasing our international standing, why they would hand over the most vital shipping port in the world over for free is unknown. To the upper echelons of the Kaiserreich however, this makes perfect sense. With our Military Mission in nigh total power, it only makes sense for them to give us this most vital of shipping lanes. Afterall, without us, how can they hope to successfully carve out a German presence in the Middle-East? "
kxott.6.a:0 "A toast to our Ottoman friends!"

kxott.7.t:0 "Business with the Ottomans"
kxott.7.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire, a new ally for the Reichspakt, has been engaging in business ventures and trading with our Mittelafrikan colony. The business we exchange with each other has proven beneficial to the nation, with revenue going up and likewise our stability."
kxott.7.a:0 "Art of the deal!"

kxott.8.t:0 "Dealing with the Rumors"
kxott.8.d:0 "Our mission in the shadows seemed to be going well until we learned of the publication of an article in the Constantinople newspaper Tercüman-ı Hakikat, which would suggest that the current government is only a front for a secret administration, highlighting the quasi-robotic attitude of the ministers in public and the fact that they are almost all bureaucrats unknown to the general public, whose pro-German tendencies are suspicious. Fortunately this 'investigation' was only in its early stages, Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf had the opportunity to nip it in the bud, a secret raid led by our most experienced soldiers allowed the discreet arrests of the journalists behind the article as well as the dissident intellectuals who had expressed their agreement with the article or interest in continuing this investigation.\n\nWe then printed a statement in all state newspapers denouncing these nonsensical conspiracy theories, we even obtained the Sultan's signature, which will make the last skeptics obedient. It would seem that suspicions in the majority of the Empire have dropped drastically following our measures, we can thus continue our mission in the shadows without fear of some parasites preventing us from doing so. However Schellendorf has ordered all our officers aware of our shadow cabinet to exercise the utmost discretion."
kxott.8.a:0 "Discretion shall be our top priority."

kxott.9.t:0 "Construction of the Damascus-Dar-es-Salaam Railway"
kxott.9.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire, with funds from our business and trade, has sponsored construction and actually helped with construction on a giant railway leading from Damascus to Dar-es-Salaam. The railway has been completed now, and trains are moving back and forth along the lines already, to visit the great Ottoman city or rather the grand capital of Mittelafrika."

Cheers from the coronation members erupted, and the Kaiser of Germany has only tightened the bond with the Ottoman Empire."
kxott.11.a:0 "Hail to thee in the victor's wreath!"

kxott.12.t:0 "Sultan Abdulmecid II Forced to Accept German Overlordship"
kxott.12.d:0 "Our takeover is complete, no more government, no more institutions block our path to complete German political supremacy in these Ottoman lands. However, there remains a figure that is very difficult to get rid of, Sultan Abdulmecid II, Ottoman head of state and Commander of the Muslim Believers with his title of Caliph. However, the docile character of Abdulmecid, nicknamed the 'Sultan of the Arts' makes him a perfect puppet leader for our administration. The Sultan already placed under almost constant surveillance for months has not made an address to his people for a long time, however it would now be useful for him to make one now: announcing his submission to Germany and the Military Mission.\n\nOf course his popularity will suffer greatly, but there is no doubt that a significant part of the Ottomans and Muslims will follow him and serve us as they should. After that we will leave the Sultan all the time he wants to devote to his art and to enjoy sitting on his throne, as long as he does not leave the Palace under constant German surveillance we will establish a relationship of 'cooperation' with the old man."
kxott.12.a:0 "All according to the plan."

kxott.13.t:0 "The Ottomans at War!"
kxott.13.d:0 "Our old Weltkrieg ally, the Ottoman Empire, has been engulfed in the flames of war! We may receive them as an ally later as a result of aid, but then again, we are freely giving away equipment to them, and they may not even win."
kxott.13.a:0 "Send them aid."
kxott.13.b:0 "Oh well."

kxott.14.t:0 "Aid from Germany"

kxott.15.t:0 "Officers Propose Another Military Mission to the Ottomans"
kxott.15.d:0 "With the Ottoman Empire struggling in a war against Egypt and its Cairo Axis, the Ottoman Empire stands in danger. Its army is already seeing failure. Perhaps the first military mission wasn't enough, and a second military mission may be needed to sharpen the Ottoman soldiers..."
kxott.15.a:0 "Let's do it."
kxott.15.b:0 "Not again."

kxott.16.t:0 "Germany Offers Aid"
kxott.16.d:0 "The German Empire has offered our struggling Empire some aid! We will get some guns and artillery from the ordeal, and along with that some reassurance that we are not totally alone in this war. Thank you, Germany! However, this will increase German influence..."
kxott.16.a:0 "Our savior!"
kxott.16.b:0 "Never again!"

kxott.17.t:0 "German Officers Demand to Take Charge"
kxott.17.d:0 "The Second German Military Mission has seen success where they operate, and the Ottomans have seen failure in their operations. It is only reasonable, to the Germans at least, to demand full control over the Ottoman military. This will drastically increase German influence, but it may be what we need..."

kxott.19.a:0 "We should tread carefully."

kxott.20.t:0 "The German Military Mission Fully Takes Over!"
kxott.20.d:0 "With the failure of the Ottoman military to deal with the threats at hand, Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf has grown powerful enough in the Ottoman military to warrant a complete shadow takeover of the government, the Sultan has announced that he is dismissing the current government and appointing a 'provisional government' made up of apolitical politicians, but in reality this is just a facade, the men proposed will only be a fake government put in place while we centralize power around the German mission.\n\nWhile the soldiers do not know about this transfer of leadership, and neither does the citizenry, a few members of the Ottoman government have fled and prepare to spread the word. As for us, hopefully this sudden change in leadership will break the stalemate and lead to a great Ottoman victory..."
kxott.20.a:0 "Oh..."

kxott.23.t:0 "The Future of Our New Domain"
kxott.23.d:0 "We have finally come out of the shadows, put an end to the puppet government, suspended all Ottoman institutions, our takeover is now complete, all power is concentrated in the hands of Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf and the German Military Mission. We now have no reason to keep this useless Sultan on his throne, no doubt he will look for an opportunity to flee or to form a rebellion against our mandate, only the title of Caliph will be left to him to appease the Muslims. Schellendorf can now begin the transition of this declining Empire towards a true German colony in the service of the Fatherland.\n\nErich Prigge, one of the most decorated general of our mission and the man in charge of internal affairs, proposed to our leader to not leave the throne empty, he indeed had the idea of offering the throne to Kaiser Wilhelm himself, who would then see himself crowned in Constantinople in Ottoman traditions and would take the title of Sultan. Prigge thinks that placing the leader of the world's greatest power as our Head of State would be an undeniable symbol of prestige and might, of course, the Emperor would return to Berlin afterwards and let us govern, this title only being honorary. Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf is considering the proposal, but also sees some benefit in simply modeling our governance on Mittelafrika and German East Asia, with himself becoming the sole symbol of German power in the Middle East."
kxott.23.a:0 "The Kaiser shall become the Kayser-i-Rum of these lands!"
kxott.23.b:0 "We have no need for such a figurehead."

kxott.24.t:0 "A Time for Retirement?"
kxott.24.d:0 "The bulk of our reform projects seem to be coming to fruition, Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and his allies have indeed completely altered the foundations of Ottoman institutions, the new Ottoman Empire looks more and more like the Germany of the Middle East with each passing day, and we can be pleased with the success of our mission.\n\nSome members of our coalition have therefore proposed that Grand Vizier Bernstorff step down and enjoy a well-deserved rest - to make way for a Grand Vizier native to the Empire, putting forward the name of Musa Kâzim Paşa, leader of the Democratic Party and friend of Bernstoff, who will perpetuate the diplomat's legacy while proving that the Ottoman people accept their German allies and brothers with open arms. However, the German Military Mission Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf are hostile to such a replacement, fearing that the Ottoman Empire would drift away from Germany if such a change of Grand Vizier took place, and proposed the appointment of Grand Vizier Max von Oppenheim, an archaeologist and expert on Middle Eastern lands, who they felt would be the perfect choice to appease the Ottoman populations and elites while ensuring the Empire's loyalty to Germany. A final option would simply be for Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff not to tender his resignation to the Sultan, and to continue his job in the position of Grand Vizier - after all, it had worked out well for him so far."
kxott.24.a:0 "Bernstorff has done a good job so far."
kxott.24.b:0 "Our Turkish friend, Musa Kâzim Paşa is the best choice."
kxott.24.c:0 "Max von Oppenheim is the man we need."

kxott.25.t:0 "A Change in Leadership?"
kxott.25.d:0 "It would seem that our initial efforts have borne fruit, the German administration in these eastern lands once administered by The Sick Man of Europe is now well anchored, both institutionally, thanks to our maintenance of a form of monarchical legitimacy in the figure of the Sultan, and in the minds of the Ottomans, their revolt and terrorist attacks diminishing with each passing day under our control. General Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf, recently promoted to the rank of Field Marshal of the Fatherland, has so far successfully led us, from the early days of our military mission to our current reign, passing through the period of the Shadow Cabinet.\n\nSome of our officers have therefore proposed that this true hero of the Empire, take a well-deserved rest and give up his functions as Head of the German Military Mission, proposing as his replacement the younger Johann von Leers. Johann is far from equaling the military skills and prestige of Schellendorf (which explains why he is supported by a large portion of our officers, so that they can see their own autonomy increased), but turns out to be a prolific author, his support for the Muslim religion, of which he admires especially their resistance to Judaism, would make him a popular figure for the Ottoman Muslim populations. However his penchant for esotericism and his völkisch and pagan tendencies make some of our more traditionalist and Protestant generals doubt his abilities to lead us properly, although other members of the expedition, such as Carl Croneiß and Otto von Feldman, support Leers' candidacy because of their close ideological affinity with him."

kxott.25.b:0 "Fresh blood is needed, Johann von Leers shall lead us!"

Leers also has the support of Mohammed Amin al-Husseini, an Arab nationalist and influential Muslim leader known for his anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic activism against the Jews of Palestine as well as his assertive pro-German tendencies, both of which made him a close ally of Leers. However Leers penchant for esotericism and his völkisch and pagan tendencies make some of our more traditionalist and Protestant generals doubt his abilities to lead us properly."

kxott.27.t:0 "Passing of the Venerable Grand Vizier"
kxott.27.d:0 "Sad news was on the front page of all Ottoman newspapers this morning: the respected and popular Grand Vizier Ahmet Tevfik Pasha finally died in the night, peacefully if we are to believe the testimonies of his relatives, born in 1843, this exceptional longevity allowed the Grand Vizier to serve the Empire he loved so much for a long time. The Sultan expressed his personal condolences to his family, and even if it is true that Tevfik Pasha was more of a figurehead for the government composed of Ottoman elites due to his great age, his presence alone commanded respect and admiration.\n\nAn extraordinary session of the council of ministers was convened this morning, in his wishes, Tevfik proposed his son Ismail Hakki Okday for the position, highlighting his military experience and his energetic character. After consideration, his candidacy was presented to the Sultan who accepted it. The new Grand Vizier in his speech to the deputies promised to honor the Ottoman traditions and our alliance with Germany and pledged his eternal allegiance to the Sultan. Although Ismail Hakki Okday seems to be a popular figure and promises to be a good leader, some members of the cabinet regret that he wants to take matters into his own hands instead of being a rather passive Grand Vizier like his father. In any case it seems that our reborn Ottoman Empire is destined to continue its new Golden Age."
kxott.27.a:0 "Ismail Hakki Okday will surely be worthy of his father."

kxott.28.t:0 "A Post-Victory Direction for the Leers Regime"
kxott.28.d:0 "With the German Military Mission now curiously led by the non-martial Johann Jakob von Leers as von Schellendorf slides into a well-earned, widely respected, and highly luxurious partial retirement, our main goal and aim here in the land of the Ottomans has come into question. With the Desert War against the rebellious Cairo Axis now finally won as peace returns to the Middle East at long last, the need for such a martially-minded colonial government is no longer so pressing or even warranted, so perhaps a change in focus and direction is in order. However, von Leers - or Omar Amin as he is more commonly referred to in increasing frequency as he further embraces his recently-adopted Islamic faith - is a varied intellectual who dabbles in many different ideological disciplines and schools of theory, and as such he has some manner of choice in how we shall continue to revive the Sick Man of Europe.\n\nFirstly, Johann von Leers could continue to focus on his esoteric research and theo-mystical pursuits whilst leaving most matters of actual administration to loyal locals and the military mission’s general staff using the rubber stamp of Leers and the ‘Sovereign’. Leers himself is an early Thule Society member thanks to his friendship with the Society’s founder and former Germanenorden member Rudolf Freiherr von Sebottendorf a.k.a. Adam Alfred Rudolf Glauer, or alternatively known as Erwin Torre, whom von Leers hopes to invite into his government here in Constantinople due to their shared ideological and theological interests, both being devoted Islamic converts and occult mystics, with Sebottendorf being a member of the Bektashi order of Sufi Islam and a Freemason aligned with the Committee of Union and Progress and to the Termudi banking and trading family of Thessaloniki Jews, as well as a practitioner of meditation, astrology, numerology, and alchemy. However, the two colleagues and friends differ greatly on many subjects, such as their outlook on Jews or how deeply they dabble in the occult - with von Leers despising Jews while Sebbottendorf is more amicable towards them, while Sebbottendorf is the far more occultist of the two, even dabbling in Qabalah and Rosicrucianism as well - which all will likely result in friction and conflicting orders along with all the other strangeness associated with rule by such strange intellectuals and mystics. Alternatively, Leers could take a more active role in governance while fully embracing his new identity as Omar Amin, working with his mentor in the faith Mohammed Amin al-Husseini, the Mufti of Palestine and a famed Pan-Arab instigator, anti-Imperialist, Salafist purist, and Palestinian nationalist - to lead alongside him, either as a spiritual advisor or some form of theological figurehead, in order to further the Pan-Arab cause; a cause which von Leers, or Amin, has supported since the 1930s due to viewing Islam and Judaism as Hegelian opposites of antithesis and thesis, stating that Islam broke the backbone of Jewish power in the lands that Islam has spread, keeping Jews in check, often as a protected but contained minority but sometimes through harsher means as well, left unable to take control of the apparatus of society like they have in Europe and the wider Western World, or so Amin claims. Finally, von Leers could instead take the reigns of power fully for himself while leaning into his roots as one of the literary heads of the Völkische Bewegung - being one of the movement’s main literary leaders, ideological theorists, and propagandists, and use the concept of Blood and Soil to slowly transform this pseudo-imperialist neo-colonial apparatus into a true German settler state that upholds the Völkisch tenets of organicism, racialism, populism, agrarianism, romanticized Germanic ethno-nationalism, and radical anti-Semitism whilst still supporting his local Pan-Arab allies like his mentor the Grand Mufti. Whatever Leers - or Amin - decides, however, shall change the face of Anatolia, the Levant, and the wider Middle East for ages to come..."
kxott.28.a:0 "Maintain our dedication to Thule and Islamic esotericism."
kxott.28.b:0 "Focus on piety and Pan-Arabism with Leers supported by the Mufti."
kxott.28.c:0 "Erect a theocracy under the Mufti with Leers at his side."
kxott.28.e:0 "Forward the Völkische Bewegung and German settlement."

kxott.29.t:0 "A New Chance at Balkan Dominance"
kxott.29.d:0 "Thanks to our renewed alliance with the Germans and their ever-present military mission, we have a newfound opportunity to possibly re-pursue our old claims in the Balkans, for Germany may be willing to acquiesce Ottoman expansion into Southern Europe now that we are inexorably tied to their government and will. Should we once again march northwards in order to seize parts of the Balkans, such as Greece, Bulgaria, and beyond, as well as our Islamic brethren in Bosnia and Albania, or should we merely focus on what we have so far in favor of stability and avoiding the risk of overextension?"
kxott.29.a:0 "Abandon these over-ambitious claims once and for all."
kxott.29.b:0 "Under Germany’s blessing, we march for the southern Balkans."
kxott.29.c:0 "We march for our full Balkan claims of old!"

kxott.30.t:0 "Leers’ Connection to the Pan-Arab Dream"
kxott.30.d:0 "Long has Johann von Leers been an ally to the Pan-Arab cause, seeing it as the Hegelian antithesis to Judaism’s disdainful thesis. As such, he has endeavored over the years to further the Pan-Arab and Arab nationalist causes championed by his Islamic mentor and namesake Mohammed Amin al-Hussein, Mufti of Palestine and perhaps the greatest spiritual ally to Germany in the Middle East. However, now that von Leers is in a position to further this dream due to his position at the head of the German Military Mission, perhaps it is finally time that Germany throws its full lot behind Pan-Arabism and its dream of intercontinental unification?"
kxott.30.a:0 "We are overextended as it is. Only pay lip service and economic aid to Pan-Arabism."
kxott.30.b:0 "Omar Amin and Mufti al-Hussein shall realize the Pan-Arab dream through force!"

kxott.31.t:0 "The Pan-Islamist Dream Made Manifest?"
kxott.31.d:0 "Accused in the past of assisting Pan-Islamic rebels in the past, and once discussing the topic of Pan-Islamism at length in person with the former Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire in the past, Max von Oppenheim - current head of the prestigious Oppenheim banking family of affluent European and Middle Eastern Jews, and an accomplished archaeologist, orientalist, historian, diplomat, and lawyer in his own right - is a curious fellow to be the herald of Pan-Islamism today, but that could perhaps be the case given his newfound position at the head of the German administration running the Ottoman Empire. Seeing it as a way of establishing peace and cooperation across the faith, benefiting both its newfound allies in the Reichspakt and his own Jewish kin across the world so frequently under the Islamic boot, von Oppenheim could leverage the newfound strength and prestige of this once-dying empire in order to realize an intercontinental dream of piety and multiethnic cooperation, all for the good of the Kaiserriech. What shall he do? "
kxott.31.a:0 "Mere rumors and hearsay. Von Oppenheim is no ally to Pan-Islam."
kxott.31.b:0 "Von Oppenheim shall guide the Ottomans as the heralds of Pan-Islam!"

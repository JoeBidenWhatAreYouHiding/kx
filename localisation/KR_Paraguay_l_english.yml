PAR_pensions_desc:0 "War veterans, families of the lost and many other personnel receive rightful compensation for defending our nation in the war for the Chaco. However, doing the right thing is often costly and our budget suffers from all the privileges and good payment for military personnel"
PAR_prussia_desc:0 "Paraguay at this point is an extension of its army, as the Civil War coupled with the failure of mainstream parties resulted in two coups and an almost entire lack of civil presence in actual decision making. The army is however immensely respected, and morale even among the lowest in the hierarchy is sky high, as are the generous benefits for joining it in comparison to common work available"
PAR_bm_desc:0 "More than a fiscal crisis, Paraguay suffers from a harsh case of lack of imports, as the few goods imported to South America rarely reach the nation."
PAR_bm_selfsuf1_desc:0 "After a series of decisive measures, we have finally re-gained out capacity to acquiring goods and started making said goods in our nation. We are taking the first steps towards true independence, as painful as they are"
PAR_bm_selfsuf2_desc:0 "We have reached industrial output levels high enough for the government to declare our programs a success. An empty boast when it comes to most metrics, but one that increases national morale and thus increased spending in the short turn, as the people regained faith in the economy and the state recovered much of its losses"
PAR_slash_desc:0 "Harsh budget cuts were the way chosen to deal with our budgetary issues. It wont go well with the military whose pensions are at risk..."
PAR_agriprotecc_desc:0 "Paraguayan farmers now have proper protection against the flood of cheap foreign foodstuffs that threatened them"
PAR_desu_vult_desc:0 "Our land was always a bastion of faith, defending the land from the greedy hands of our neighbours. The church's close relation with our regime ensures that the people knows who's in the right at all times"
PAR_cav_desc:0 "Trucks can be faster, but yoy just cant trust the infrastructure deep in the South of the world. Sometimes, a position needs to be reinforced, and hasitily so, and our horsemen also can use their mobilty offensively with their new funding and training"
PAR_specforcetraining_desc:0 "A few veterans of the War have been training new, elite forces that will spearhead our assaults against the enemies of the nation"
PAR_elite_army_desc:0 "Truly with no equal, Paraguay is now truly an Army with a State, as its military forces have achieved such hegemony over all matters, and such mastery of their local warfare, its doubtful for its legacy to fade away"
PAR_no_pasaran_desc:0 "Those who fought for our nation, even against unimaginable odds; Those who fought against Bolivian aggression and foreign plots, they know what its stake and will never give up as long the fight can continue!"

PAR_planning_bonus_desc:0 "Our expert and veteran generals have much experience in planning and preparing offensives, but now they have the proper tools and are accustomed to planning war against actual foes, not just Bolivians"
PAR_exportseffort_desc:0 "Our economy should not be isolated, and we should not hesitate to help our neighbours to recover. The profits we get by fuffiling their import demands are nothing but byproducts of being a good neighbour, wishing prosperity for the continent"
PAR_freedom_desc:0 "The rampant nationalist zeal in our country came from more than a lack of faith in common politicans, but the utter failure of our nation to properly protect individuals and free entreprise, leading to war and unrest. Part of these fall on our inability to correct our constitution and move way from the shadowy delusions of leftist vultures"
PAR_shock_et_awe_desc:0 "Paraguayan general staff knows that it's unfeasible to stay on the defensive forever, and have more experience in modern war than most armies. The current shift towards offensive policies comes from years of debates and developments, but currently its fair to asses it's the predominant school of thought"
PAR_doctrine_review_desc:0 "The best way to learn is by studying your own mistakes. Via constant reviewing and advancing, we will always ensure that our forces are neither outdated or predictable"
PAR_your_new_empire_desc:0 "José Felix Estigarribia's control over Paraguay is nigh absolute. Its essentially"
PAR_PUS_IDEA_desc:0 "Heavily influenced by the ideas of US senator Huey Long, but with an unique militaristic spin, the Estigarribia government has changes its government to its core, and the power of the president is almost unchecked"
PAR_well_ran_budget_desc:0 "After harsh cuts, we have, at least, managed to gain some degree of budgetary relief. Now this austerity must be maintained at all costs"
PAR_fowardthinking_desc:0 "If our nation is to move foward in any way, we must ensure that those with the minds and qualification to take it there are properly funded and promoted"

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_EXILED_DESC:0"Today, Huey Long looks out; forlorn over a balcony in Asunción, longing for the day when he can return to the United States. Forced to give up his chance at ruling America, and run out of his native land, Long has seen the worst of the world, and has mostly given up hope of returning home. The Bounty on his head is still over 10,000$, most citizens of his now-native Paraguay view him as an illegitimate foreigner; and he has been forced to learn the native tongue. In fact, he is no longer even referred to as “Huey Long”, but rather as Huey Largo, the translation of Long is Spanish. However, despite his Desperate state, Huey and his small group of Exiled advisors still hold out hope that Huey will once again return to America. And even if he will never reclaim his home, Huey Largo still has taken to helping his new home of Paraguay. Tackling the nation’s Land barons, bringing prosperity to the citizens, and extending the “Share Our Wealth Program” to Paraguay. So even if Long will never bring his ideal to America, Huey will continue to improve the lives of citizens in his new home of Paraguay. "

POLITICS_ESTIGARRIBIA_RETURNED_DESC:0 "José Félix Estigarribia, the Hero of the Chaco War, was internationally educated in both military and agricultural affairs. Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence.\nWith the return of democracy, Estigarribia's political career at first seemed to have come to an end. Estigarribia, however, has defied expectations and again risen through the ranks of the liberal party. Democratically elected, his hold on the state now is no where near as great as it once was, and though some fear he shall again seize dictatorial power, the masses cheer on the ever adaptable Hero of the Chaco War."

We shall contact them immediately and see if they are willing to stand side by side with us"

PAR_new_challenge_desc:0 "The Berlin Stock Market has crashed, and its effects are to be felt all around the globe.

The economy has suffered greatly, so nothing short of radical reforms will help."
PAR_self_sufficency:0 "Self Sufficiency"
PAR_self_sufficency_desc:0 "Paraguay's economy is in shables, but its potential isn't. We should mobilize our budget in order to start massive industrial, agricultural and infrastructural projects. Paraguay's economy shall become self-sufficient so that we can exploit its full potential."
PAR_build_buildsake:0 "Building Industry"
PAR_build_buildsake_desc:0 "While South America in general has an undevelopped industrial base, Paraguay's industry is even weaker. We need to construct new industrial complexes and for industrial purposes suited railways and roads in order to develop our industrial base."
PAR_incentivize:0 "Civil Industry Incentives"
PAR_incentivize_desc:0 "The state is mighty and powerful, but it can't do everything by itself either. We need to promote private entreprises and investments so that our industry can grow faster. Surely, if we give investors advantages, they will invest in our economy."
PAR_agrieffort:0 "Agricultural Effort"
PAR_agrieffort_desc:0 "A strong industrial base is vital for a modern economy, but we shouldn't ignore all those who won't build toasters, tanks and trucks. We need to set up agricultural subsidies and agricultural institutions which help our rural farming population."
PAR_protectionism:0 "Protectionism"
PAR_protectionism_desc:0 "Our economy doesn't only suffer from underdevelopment, it also suffers from cheap foreign competition. How are we supposed to sell our goods if foreign goods are cheaper? We need to protect our economy from the evil world!"
PAR_factorio:0 "Import Substitution Program"
PAR_factorio_desc:0 "A self-sufficient economy can't rely on imports, that's self-explanatory. We should find ways to avoid importing goods, we need to substitute everything that isn't made in Paraguay."
PAR_factory:0 "Industrialist Advances"
PAR_factory_desc:0 "Thanks to both the state and the people, our economy is quickly developping. Factories now stand there where nothing had stood before, and 'Made in Paraguay' is now omnipresent in our shops. Our industry is advancing quickly, and so should our technology."
PAR_indistrial_selfsufficiency:0 "Industrial Self Sufficiency"
PAR_indistrial_selfsufficiency_desc:0 "Our self-sufficiency plan works, that's for sure! Paraguay's economy now relies much less on imports and our manufacturing section is growing daily. 'Made in Paraguay' really does work."

PAR_slash_debt:0 "Slash The Budget"
PAR_slash_debt_desc:0 "Our state spends too much money, way too much money. We need to make cuts everywhere and anywhere if we wish to avoid bankruptcy. Most Paraguayans, from bureaucrats to veterans, won't be too happy with this, but we don't want to end up like the French in 1789, now do we?"
PAR_national_liberalism:0 "National Liberalism"
PAR_national_liberalism_desc:0 "The state can't play god, that is a sad reality. Instead of handing over the economy to the bureaucrats, we need to liberalize it in favour of private entreprise and economic freedom."
PAR_export_focus_economy:0 "Export Focused Economy"
PAR_export_focus_economy_desc:0 "The Paraguayan market is quite small, but the German market isn't. In order to maximize the strength and the profits of the Paraguayan economy, we need to augment the exportation of Paraguayan goods to the whole world."
PAR_increase_yields:0 "Increase Mining Yields"
PAR_increase_yields_desc:0 "The mining sector is relatively small, but even then the Chaco still has quite important resource deposits. We need to increase the productivity of the mining sector so that we can export more primary resources."
PAR_cut_veterans_pensions:0 "Cut Veteran's Pensions"

PAR_cut_military_incentives:0 "Cut Military Incentives"
PAR_cut_military_incentives_desc:0 "Our military is quite enormous in comparison to the state. Our military spending is far too high, and it will not seize to rise. We need to cut military incentives before our state collapses under the burden of the military budget."
PAR_commonsense_pensions:0 "Commonsense Pensions"
PAR_commonsense_pensions_desc:0 "No one would dare to cut all pensions, but at the same time our pension system is underfunded and we can't afford to spend more money. In these times of needs, we need some commonsense policies regarding our pension system."
PAR_fiscal_responsability:0 "Fiscal Responsibility"
PAR_fiscal_responsability_desc:0 "We have successfully reformed the state budget, and we don't run a deficit anymore. Thanks to a reasonable budget and responsable fiscal politics, our budget is once again stable and supportable."

PAR_intensified_propaganda_desc:0 "In these times of troubles, it is much easier for illegal groups and foreign rivals to destabilize Paraguay. We can't let anyone slander the name of our great nation, and we can't let anyone believe the lies of the enemy."
PAR_the_outwards_solution:0 "Outwards Solution"
PAR_the_outwards_solution_desc:0 "Now that our country stands weakened by the crisis, foreigners are glaring at Paraguay, waiting for any display of weakness in our borders to strike.

PAR_estigarribato:0 "The Estigarribato"

PAR_doctrine:0 "Doctrine Review"

PAR_garra:0 "Garra Guarani"

PAR_concentrated_fire:0 "Concentrated Fire"
PAR_concentrated_fire_desc:0 "A single artillery piece can kill a few soldiers with a perfect hit, but fifty artillery pieces can destroy a whole battalion with some decent hits. We need to concentrate our firepower for maximum effectiveness."

### Events ###
par.1.t:0 "The Republic of Paraguay"
par.1.d:0 "After the devastating War of the Triple Alliance, Paraguay was shattered and broken almost beyond recognition; the vast majority of its male population dead or orphaned. The extreme demographic and economic damage was not all, however, as both Brazil and Argentina took slices of land off the Guarani Republic and effectively only kept it's sovereignty as a buffer state between the two nations. Rebuilding and recovering from that disaster was no easy feat, and political instability still corroded the nation. In 1904, a Liberal revolution against the rule of Colorados broke out. The Liberal rule started a period of great political instability, which culminated in a Civil War in 1922 between rival political factions.Then, in late 1929, war again came to Paraguay by the hand of Bolivia. That nation, under economic pressure to secure the rumoured oil wells of the Chaco region, aggressively started to assert its claims in the disputed area. The Chaco War took four gruesome years, and by 1933 Paraguay had completely routed the Bolivian forces and were starting to occupy their lands. The total victory did not came without a cost however, as mounting debt and military expenses continue to be a burden on the government. The Bolivian military was poorly equipped and poorly trained to fight in the region, and its low morale meant the Paraguayan casualties were far smaller.The political situation did not improve however, and Liberal rule was faltering. Rafael Franco and other radical leaders launched a coup in 1934 based on left-authoritarian principles, but were deposed after a short three month rule by Chaco War hero José Félix Estigarribia. Now, the age of liberal chaos is over, and José Felix's rule is one of great peace; his actions against the ''Syndicalist'' Franco and Bolivian invaders greatly influencing politics, as he is almost unanimously acclaimed as a national saviour and hero. With the rise of the Argentine Patriotic League, Estigarribia and his cabinet are again in high alert, as Manuel Carlés did little to hide his expansionist goals in his speech upon ascending to the leadership of that nation, war may soon be upon Paraguay once again."
par.1.a:0 "We have brought Peace and Justice to our new Republic."

par.2.t:0 "Anti LPA Rally"
par.2.d:0 "Argentina's new President, Manuel Carlés, is relentless in his smear campaign against Paraguay and other counties he deems enemies of the Argentine state. Today in Asuncion, hundreds of people gathered to protest his insults and his rhetoric, demanding an official diplomatic break between our nations. While this is unlikely to happen, such a danger is politically good for the army, as the threat of war is a reminder of who saved Paraguay a few short years ago."
par.2.a:0 "Argentina can't regain its greatness; it never had any!"

par.3.t:0 "Black Monday ravages our Economy"
par.3.d:0 "Paraguay, despite being a landlocked nation, is connected to the wider global economy via the port in Asuncion and the River Plate. The stock market crash news first arrived to us as a curiosity, but soon the effects were felt; foreigners can't buy our produce, and we are having immense difficulties in importing vital goods for our nation. Worse still, the budgetary situation has entirely collapsed, and retired military personnel are already up in arms, ready to defend their rights should we encroach on them in any way. Truly, bad times are ahead, and Paraguay may very well have to live in commercial isolation..."
par.3.a:0 "We don't need them!"

par.4.t:0 "Military Payment Issues"

par.4.a:0 "We really need them..."

par.5.t:0 "Pensionists Protest!"
par.5.d:0 "Veterans and other pensioners have protested in very large numbers after the announcement of delays to their payments.

par.5.a:0 "Nothing we can do about it!"

par.6.t:0 "Military Discontent"
par.6.d:0 "The payment issues have not affected every single Paraguayan soldier, but discontent spreads like the plague in the barracks as no improvement of the situation is visible to the common soldier. A few quartelazos and other minor revolts have been suppressed, but we are unsure for how long we can sustain the situation."
par.6.a:0 "Unfortunate."

par.7.t:0 "Rafael Franco in Exile"
par.7.d:0 "Ever since he was ousted from government due to his radical syndicalism, Rafael Franco further delved into Left Wing rhetoric in exile in Chile. Now styling himself a 'Solanist Totalist', he clamours for Revolution in Paraguay from his exile. For years now few paid any heed to him, just one of the many deposed despots in this world, but now, with our position threatened and syndicalist spies threatening us, he directly calls for a coup that would allow his return, and finds some who are willing to listen."
par.7.a:0 "Ramblings of a madman."

par.8.t:0 "Disturbances in Reconquered Lands"
par.8.d:0 "Bolivia's foul plots are endless. As they again begin a war of aggression to claim the Chaco from us and give it to their corporate masters, we are forced to face infiltrators in the areas liberated in the previous war. Their disruptions, while small, are symbolic of how far Bolivian treachery can go."
par.8.a:0 "They will see things our way in time."

par.9.t:0 "Huey Long is elected President of the US"
par.9.d:0 "Former US Senator Huey Long has been sucessful in his bid to be elected President of the United States of America ina an incredibly contentious election. Running against Syndicalist and Sell-out candidates alike, Huey has managed to triumph in key states of that nation and prove that the people of the Americas had enough of the elites who seek to put us down and sell our wealth rather than share it! Many Paraguayan papers have begun to shower the man with praise before the ballots were finished being counted. Time will tell if his foul foes will accept the loss gracefully."
par.9.a:0 "Congratulations Amigo!"

par.10.t:0 "Aid the AUS?"
par.10.d:0 "The United States are under Siege! Huey Long has been usurped by Syndicalist and Banker theives and they seek to enslave the people of North America by force. Popular outcry was strong when news reached Paraguay, with many vocal unemployed veterans of the Chaco War demanding an official intervention. Tired of waiting, now all they request is apparel aid and ships to send them to the US to fight for Peace and Justice in the name of our nation."
par.10.a:0 "We must help our American friends to free their nation!"
par.10.b:0 "We cant afford it, sadly."

par.11.t:0 "The Chaco Brigade arrives!"
par.11.d:0 "From the small nation of Paraguay comes the brave Chaco Brigade. Named after a disputed area, which caused a war fuelled by greed and denounced by the Kingfish publicly here in the States, the folks in Paraguay regard him as the only foreigner to see the truth behind that war and to tell things the way they are. Long's popularity only kept rising in the past few years, and news of the coup against democracy have outraged the Paraguayan populace, and many thousands have decided to lend a hand to us in this final struggle for the very soul of America."
par.11.a:0 "Our cause is just!"

par.12.t:0 "Paraguayan Congratulations!"
par.12.d:0 "With the end of the conflict, it seems as though we finally have some time to breathe. Letters from Paraguayan citizens, personally thanking the Kingfish for his fight for freedom and against Syndicalism, keep arriving from the small South American nation that regards Long as a true hero."
par.12.a:0 "Peace is it's own reward, but we thank them nonetheless."

par.13.t:0 "Military Revolt!"
par.13.d:0 "It seems that the situation for Estigarribia is no longer suistainable, and democracy stands at it's end as several barracks rise up across the nation agaisnt our failed and slow economic policies. With all the chaos, it can be known that whoever takes power will be faced with similar economic problems Paraguay faced at the start of Black Monday, as previous government policies are changed. Two major factions have real chances of keeping control of the Presidential Palace once the dust settles; the ultranationalists under Higinio and the Totalists under Rafael Franco, who has radicalized even further in the past few months. After several hours of skirmished, a Pronunciamento reaches the people: "
par.13.a:0 "Moringio and Patriotic Officers have saved the Nation!"
par.13.b:0 "Franco has Returned!"

par.14.t:0 "Huey Long heading to Paraguay"
par.14.d:0 "The War in North America took a turn for the worse, and Huey Long was forced to flee the traitorous forces closing in on him. Nothing would please them more than his death, and his request for asylum here in Paraguay was accepted immediatly, and he is scheduled to reach Asuncion shortly. A scheme involving ships with Paraguayan flags will ensure he evades capture by traitors, and once he gets here, we will recieve a proper hero's welcome!"
par.14.a:0 "We are waiting for him!"

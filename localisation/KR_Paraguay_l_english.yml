PAR_pensions_desc:0 "War veterans, families of the lost and many other personnel receive rightful compensation for defending our nation in the war for the Chaco. However, doing the right thing is often costly and our budget suffers from all the privileges and good payment for military personnel"
PAR_prussia_desc:0 "Paraguay at this point is an extension of its army, as the Civil War coupled with the failure of mainstream parties resulted in two coups and an almost entire lack of civil presence in actual decision making. The army is however immensely respected, and morale even among the lowest in the hierarchy is sky high, as are the generous benefits for joining it in comparison to common work available"
PAR_bm_desc:0 "More than a fiscal crisis, Paraguay suffers from a harsh case of lack of imports, as the few goods imported to South America rarely reach the nation."
PAR_bm_selfsuf1_desc:0 "After a series of decisive measures, we have finally re-gained out capacity to acquiring goods and started making said goods in our nation. We are taking the first steps towards true independence, as painful as they are"
PAR_bm_selfsuf2_desc:0 "We have reached industrial output levels high enough for the government to declare our programs a success. An empty boast when it comes to most metrics, but one that increases national morale and thus increased spending in the short turn, as the people regained faith in the economy and the state recovered much of its losses"
PAR_slash_desc:0 "Harsh budget cuts were the way chosen to deal with our budgetary issues. It wont go well with the military whose pensions are at risk..."
PAR_agriprotecc_desc:0 "Paraguayan farmers now have proper protection against the flood of cheap foreign foodstuffs that threatened them"

PAR_exportseffort_desc:0 "Our economy should not be isolated, and we should not hesitate to help our neighbours to recover. The profits we get by fuffiling their import demands are nothing but byproducts of being a good neighbour, wishing prosperity for the continent"
PAR_freedom_desc:0 "The rampant nationalist zeal in our country came from more than a lack of faith in common politicans, but the utter failure of our nation to properly protect individuals and free entreprise, leading to war and unrest. Part of these fall on our inability to correct our constitution and move way from the shadowy delusions of leftist vultures"
PAR_shock_et_awe_desc:0 "Paraguayan general staff knows that it's unfeasible to stay on the defensive forever, and have more experience in modern war than most armies. The current shift towards offensive policies comes from years of debates and developments, but currently its fair to asses it's the predominant school of thought"

PAR_your_new_empire_desc:0 "José Felix Estigarribia's control over Paraguay is nigh absolute. Its essentially"
PAR_PUS_IDEA_desc:0 "Heavily influenced by the ideas of US senator Huey Long, but with an unique militaristic spin, the Estigarribia government has changes its government to its core, and the power of the president is almost unchecked"
PAR_well_ran_budget_desc:0 "After harsh cuts, we have, at least, managed to gain some degree of budgetary relief. Now this austerity must be maintained at all costs"
PAR_fowardthinking_desc:0 "If our nation is to move foward in any way, we must ensure that those with the minds and qualification to take it there are properly funded and promoted"

POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_EXILED_DESC:0"Today, Huey Long looks out; forlorn over a balcony in Asunción, longing for the day when he can return to the United States. Forced to give up his chance at ruling America, and run out of his native land, Long has seen the worst of the world, and has mostly given up hope of returning home. The Bounty on his head is still over 10,000$, most citizens of his now-native Paraguay view him as an illegitimate foreigner; and he has been forced to learn the native tongue. In fact, he is no longer even referred to as “Huey Long”, but rather as Huey Largo, the translation of Long is Spanish. However, despite his Desperate state, Huey and his small group of Exiled advisors still hold out hope that Huey will once again return to America. And even if he will never reclaim his home, Huey Largo still has taken to helping his new home of Paraguay. Tackling the nation’s Land barons, bringing prosperity to the citizens, and extending the “Share Our Wealth Program” to Paraguay. So even if Long will never bring his ideal to America, Huey will continue to improve the lives of citizens in his new home of Paraguay. "

Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence. However, a romantic nationalist, Estigarribia has only encouraged extreme movements which seek to ultimately depose him.

Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence.\nWith the return of democracy, Estigarribia's political career at first seemed to have come to an end. Estigarribia, however, has defied expectations and again risen through the ranks of the liberal party. Democratically elected, his hold on the state now is no where near as great as it once was, and though some fear he shall again seize dictatorial power, the masses cheer on the ever adaptable Hero of the Chaco War."

 PAR_state_cat_up_asuncion_desc: "By encouraging planned urbanisation in Asunción and Concepción, we will be able to effectively improve the living standards of our citizens and be able to avoid land speculation. That should also grant us more space for our industry."
 PAR_state_cat_up_chaco_boreal_desc: "The Chaco region is scarcely inhabited, but it has tons of free land we can use for farming. Sponsoring farmers to open new farms in the region will help our agricultural exports and encourage immigration to the region."
 PAR_state_cat_up_misiones_desc: "The newly conquered region of Misiones has just been integrated in our country, and a way to integrate it more deeply will be by proceeding with planned urbanisation in the city of Posadas, the main urban centre in the region. This should ensure the sympathy of the people in the region towards our regime."
 PAR_state_cat_up_else_desc: "The newly conquered region of [FROM.GetName], rightfully ours, is in dare need of development, since it was left in a backwards state by previous controller.

PAR_self_sufficency:0 "Self Sufficiency"
PAR_self_sufficency_desc:0 "Paraguay's economy is in shables, but its potential isn't. We should mobilize our budget in order to start massive industrial, agricultural and infrastructural projects. Paraguay's economy shall become self-sufficient so that we can exploit its full potential."
PAR_build_buildsake:0 "Building Industry"
PAR_build_buildsake_desc:0 "While South America in general has an undevelopped industrial base, Paraguay's industry is even weaker. We need to construct new industrial complexes and for industrial purposes suited railways and roads in order to develop our industrial base."
PAR_incentivize:0 "Civil Industry Incentives"

PAR_agrieffort:0 "Agricultural Effort"
PAR_agrieffort_desc:0 "A strong industrial base is vital for a modern economy, but we shouldn't ignore all those who won't build toasters, tanks and trucks. We need to set up agricultural subsidies and agricultural institutions which help our rural farming population."

PAR_factorio:0 "Import Substitution Program"
PAR_factorio_desc:0 "A self-sufficient economy can't rely on imports, that's self-explanatory. We should find ways to avoid importing goods, we need to substitute everything that isn't made in Paraguay."

PAR_slash_debt:0 "Slash The Budget"
PAR_slash_debt_desc:0 "Our state spends too much money, way too much money. We need to make cuts everywhere and anywhere if we wish to avoid bankruptcy. Most Paraguayans, from bureaucrats to veterans, won't be too happy with this, but we don't want to end up like the French in 1789, now do we?"
PAR_national_liberalism:0 "National Liberalism"
PAR_national_liberalism_desc:0 "The state can't play god, that is a sad reality. Instead of handing over the economy to the bureaucrats, we need to liberalize it in favour of private entreprise and economic freedom."
PAR_export_focus_economy:0 "Export Focused Economy"
PAR_export_focus_economy_desc:0 "The Paraguayan market is quite small, but the German market isn't. In order to maximize the strength and the profits of the Paraguayan economy, we need to augment the exportation of Paraguayan goods to the whole world."

### Events ###
par.1.t:0 "The Republic of Paraguay"
par.1.d:0 "After the devastating War of the Triple Alliance, Paraguay was shattered and broken almost beyond recognition; the vast majority of its male population dead or orphaned. The extreme demographic and economic damage was not all, however, as both Brazil and Argentina took slices of land off the Guarani Republic and effectively only kept it's sovereignty as a buffer state between the two nations. Rebuilding and recovering from that disaster was no easy feat, and political instability still corroded the nation. In 1904, a Liberal revolution against the rule of Colorados broke out. The Liberal rule started a period of great political instability, which culminated in a Civil War in 1922 between rival political factions.Then, in late 1929, war again came to Paraguay by the hand of Bolivia. That nation, under economic pressure to secure the rumoured oil wells of the Chaco region, aggressively started to assert its claims in the disputed area. The Chaco War took four gruesome years, and by 1933 Paraguay had completely routed the Bolivian forces and were starting to occupy their lands. The total victory did not came without a cost however, as mounting debt and military expenses continue to be a burden on the government. The Bolivian military was poorly equipped and poorly trained to fight in the region, and its low morale meant the Paraguayan casualties were far smaller.The political situation did not improve however, and Liberal rule was faltering. Rafael Franco and other radical leaders launched a coup in 1934 based on left-authoritarian principles, but were deposed after a short three month rule by Chaco War hero José Félix Estigarribia. Now, the age of liberal chaos is over, and José Felix's rule is one of great peace; his actions against the ''Syndicalist'' Franco and Bolivian invaders greatly influencing politics, as he is almost unanimously acclaimed as a national saviour and hero. With the rise of the Argentine Patriotic League, Estigarribia and his cabinet are again in high alert, as Manuel Carlés did little to hide his expansionist goals in his speech upon ascending to the leadership of that nation, war may soon be upon Paraguay once again."
par.1.a:0 "We have brought Peace and Justice to our new Republic."

par.2.t:0 "Anti LPA Rally"
par.2.d:0 "Argentina's new President, Manuel Carlés, is relentless in his smear campaign against Paraguay and other counties he deems enemies of the Argentine state. Today in Asuncion, hundreds of people gathered to protest his insults and his rhetoric, demanding an official diplomatic break between our nations. While this is unlikely to happen, such a danger is politically good for the army, as the threat of war is a reminder of who saved Paraguay a few short years ago."
par.2.a:0 "Argentina can't regain its greatness; it never had any!"

par.3.t:0 "Black Monday ravages our Economy"
par.3.d:0 "Paraguay, despite being a landlocked nation, is connected to the wider global economy via the port in Asuncion and the River Plate. The stock market crash news first arrived to us as a curiosity, but soon the effects were felt; foreigners can't buy our produce, and we are having immense difficulties in importing vital goods for our nation. Worse still, the budgetary situation has entirely collapsed, and retired military personnel are already up in arms, ready to defend their rights should we encroach on them in any way. Truly, bad times are ahead, and Paraguay may very well have to live in commercial isolation..."
par.3.a:0 "We don't need them!"

par.4.t:0 "Military Payment Issues"

par.4.a:0 "We really need them..."

par.5.t:0 "Pensionists Protest!"
par.5.d:0 "Veterans and other pensioners have protested in very large numbers after the announcement of delays to their payments. Usually such protests would have been quickly over, but the lack of pay also extends to low ranking officers who are in charge of dealing with such rabble in more usual times."
par.5.a:0 "Nothing we can do about it!"

par.6.t:0 "Military Discontent"
par.6.d:0 "The payment issues have not affected every single Paraguayan soldier, but discontent spreads like the plague in the barracks as no improvement of the situation is visible to the common soldier. A few quartelazos and other minor revolts have been suppressed, but we are unsure for how long we can sustain the situation."
par.6.a:0 "Unfortunate."

par.7.t:0 "Rafael Franco in Exile"
par.7.d:0 "Ever since he was ousted from government due to his radical syndicalism, Rafael Franco further delved into Left Wing rhetoric in exile in Chile. Now styling himself a 'Solanist Totalist', he clamours for Revolution in Paraguay from his exile. For years now few paid any heed to him, just one of the many deposed despots in this world, but now, with our position threatened and syndicalist spies threatening us, he directly calls for a coup that would allow his return, and finds some who are willing to listen."
par.7.a:0 "Ramblings of a madman."

par.8.t:0 "Disturbances in Reconquered Lands"
par.8.d:0 "Bolivia's foul plots are endless. As they again begin a war of aggression to claim the Chaco from us and give it to their corporate masters, we are forced to face infiltrators in the areas liberated in the previous war.

par.9.d:0 "Former US Senator Huey Long has been sucessful in his bid to be elected President of the United States of America ina an incredibly contentious election. Running against Syndicalist and Sell-out candidates alike, Huey has managed to triumph in key states of that nation and prove that the people of the Americas had enough of the elites who seek to put us down and sell our wealth rather than share it! Many Paraguayan papers have begun to shower the man with praise before the ballots were finished being counted. Time will tell if his foul foes will accept the loss gracefully."

Named after a disputed area, which caused a war fuelled by greed and denounced by the Kingfish publicly here in the States, the folks in Paraguay regard him as the only foreigner to see the truth behind that war and to tell things the way they are. Long's popularity only kept rising in the past few years, and news of the coup against democracy have outraged the Paraguayan populace, and many thousands have decided to lend a hand to us in this final struggle for the very soul of America."

With all the chaos, it can be known that whoever takes power will be faced with similar economic problems Paraguay faced at the start of Black Monday, as previous government policies are changed. Two major factions have real chances of keeping control of the Presidential Palace once the dust settles; the ultranationalists under Higinio and the Totalists under Rafael Franco, who has radicalized even further in the past few months. After several hours of skirmished, a Pronunciamento reaches the people: "

Nothing would please them more than his death, and his request for asylum here in Paraguay was accepted immediatly, and he is scheduled to reach Asuncion shortly.

 par.270.d: "The Chaco War has been fought over the presence of oil in the region. While not present in the Chaco Boreal, this region has other resources to offer such as iron, bauxite and copper, very useful for our small domestic industry. Indeed we don't have the capacity to import a huge amount of resources, unlike other nations such as America, Germany or Russia, which have a huge mineral industry and a budget that allows them to trade and import resources without blinking an eye. Winning the Chaco war and acquiring oil helped us move towards that direction, but the deposits at our disposal are still very limited. Still, it's better than nothing, and we expect to be able to increase the amount of resources extracted year after year."
 par.270.a: "We shall work on expanding this booming industry then!"

 par.28.t: "Oil in the Chaco"
 par.28.d: "The Chaco war has been fought over the presence of oil in the region. While initial prospects made us expect to find oil in all of it, we were able to find it only in a small border region with Bolivia, very close to the border, but still in our hands. By controlling the most important resource in the world, albeit in a small number, we expect to be able to gain the upper hand in many negotiations, since almost all of our neighbours don't have oil fields nor have the capacity to import it. While we lack the numbers that Americans or Azeri oil fields can produce, this is still a relatively large amount, enough to be able to supply our small army, and with those refineries we expect to be able to produce even more oil both to export and to use for domestic use. This new industry should give a huge boost to our economy."
 par.28.a: "Since oil makes the world move, we might as well get involved in the business."

 par.29.t: "In the Hell of the Chaco"
 par.29.d: "This movie was shot in 1932 by Argentinian director Roque Funes. It describes the horrors of the Chaco war and how the proud Paraguayan army overcame difficulties until its victory. The movie was thought lost for years, but it has recently been discovered by the Estragó family. It has premiered in Asunción recently, was positively welcomed by the critics for its narrative and was praised by the army as very accurate and representative of the spirit of the Paraguayan army. This is a historical moment for the cinematographic scene of our nation, and we hope that this will inspire Paraguayan movie makers to be more enterprising."
 par.29.a: "Very nice movie, 7.8/10, not enough water."

 par.30.t: "Agustín Barrios tours America"
 par.30.d: "Agustín Pío Barrios is a famous Paraguayan guitarist who was able to achieve one of his dreams, that being touring America, with the first performance being held in San Juan, on the island of Puerto Rico. During said tour he was even able to play the famous song "Every man a king" with senator Huey Long himself when he toured the beautiful state of Louisiana, in Baton Rouge. Like most Paraguayans, Barrios admires Long for his stand against Bolivian aggression in the Chaco War. In this occasion the Paraguayan ambassador, who was escorting mister Barrios during his tour, expressed his best wishes to governor Long in regards for his presidential campaign, hoping that he will come out on top as the 31st president of the United States of America."
 par.30.a: "He was able to play Every man a king on a guitar? Mister Barrios is truly amazing!"

 par.31.t: "Snatching the Chaco region"
 par.31.d: "Now that Paraguay is busy fighting a war with Argentina, it's our moment to strike and seize the Chaco. While we can't realistically hope to take all of it since our army is still recovering from the defeat of the Chaco war, we can occupy the border region known as the Bolivian Chaco. Considering that the Paraguayan army is busy fighting the Argentinians, we are sure they won't wage war against us if we occupy it."
 par.31.a: "Occupy the region."
 par.31.b: "No, I don't think I will."

 par.32.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] demands Chaco!"
 par.32.d: "We received an ultimatum from [From.GetNameDef] - either we cede the entire Chaco region or they will declare war on us! It is a difficult decision; either we fight a two-front war or give away territories that were paid in blood by our nation several years ago. It may be wise to let it slide, since we can always come back later and focus on them once we have destroyed Argentina, but this move will be deeply unpopular. On the other hand, our national pride tells us to not surrender. We won against Bolivia once, we will do it again!"
 par.32.a: "We have to cede the Chaco."
 par.32.b: "We won't give up our territory! Come and get it!"

 par.33.t: "Socialist coup in Paraguay!"
 par.33.d: "Worrying news from Asunción! We have received a report that Rafael Franco returned from his exile and has now couped the Paraguayan government. They have declared they have no interest in continuing being part of an anti-syndicalist defensive pact and the previous treaty is now null. From now on, we will have to rely on one less ally."
 par.33.a: "You are joking - not another one! Oh, for God's sake, I can't, this is the second time a socialist coup happens in Paraguay in less than a decade."

 par.34.t: "Victory against Argentina!"
 par.34.d: "There is no man more heroic than he who stands against giants, and there is no nation more heroic than the small one which defies those that seek to dominate them - and the proud Paraguayan nation has been at the mercy of her powerful neighbours for her whole life. In 1864, she chose to fight to preserve the territory that rightfully belonged to her and assert her right as a sovereign state, a decision that we nearly paid for with our lives. The insistence of Francisco Solano López on fighting to the death has left his legacy fiercely disputed, and our nation deeply traumatised - the sheer death toll the War of the Triple Alliance took was beyond all comprehension.\n\nBut in 1932, Paraguay stood up - once more, we defied the infernal designs of our enemies, wading into a war against Bolivia that the world thought we could never win. In the Chaco War, we shocked the world by routing the Bolivians all the way back to La Paz despite being outnumbered, defending our right to our country and proving that we are a power to be respected. After 60 years, the sorrow of our near-destruction had given way to triumph and renewed pride.\n\nAt long last, our victory is now complete - once again, we have stood against Argentina, and today we have come out the better. The bravery and cunning of our soldiers have cast our enemies from Chaco and Misiones, and have finally returned these long-lost lands to our nation. In the streets of Asunción and across the countryside, the people shout 'Victory!' and celebrate the avenging of 1870 - no more will we be at the mercy of other nations, no more shall we be cast adrift in the world. Come what may, Paraguay shall fight, against all who would harm her - the Guaranì spirit shall never be destroyed! They will speak the names of the heroes of Paraguay on all corners of the world!"
 par.34.a: "Hurrah!"

 par.35.t: "Military help from Paraguay"
 par.35.d: "Paraguay sends a military mission to help us against fop since they have had more wars thus are more experienced, yay or nay?"
 par.35.a: "Their help will be vital"
 par.35.b: "Thanks, but we are doing fine by ourselves."

 par.36.t: "Uruguay accepts"
 par.36.d: "Uruguay accepted our military mission"

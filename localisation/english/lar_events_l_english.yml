 lar_operative_event.1.t: "Agent Captured"
 lar_operative_event.1.desc: "While deployed behind enemy lines, [This.GetName] was apprehended by enemy [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence. Reports from other sources indicate that [This.GetSheHe] is held in a remote location for interrogation. While we believe that [This.GetSheHe] will try to resist interrogation for as long as possible, it is likely that the enemy will eventually gain useful intelligence unless [This.GetSheHe] is rescued or killed before [This.GetSheHe] breaks."
 lar_operative_event.1.a: "We must mount a rescue operation!"
 lar_operative_event.2.t: "Agent forced into Hiding"
 lar_operative_event.2.desc: "While on assignment in [From.From.GetNameDef], [This.GetName] was evidently detected by [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence. The last message [This.GetSheHe] sent said that [This.GetSheHe] noticed enemy surveillance following [This.GetHerHim] and that [This.GetSheHe] was going to execute evasion and escape procedures. \n\nAs part of these procedures, [This.GetName] will naturally have broken contact with [This.GetHerHis] handlers to avoid compromising them or others.\n\nIf successful, [This.GetName] will contact us again in a few weeks."
 lar_operative_event.2.a: "We can do nothing but wait and hope."
 lar_operative_event.3.t: "Agent Killed"
 lar_operative_event.3.desc: "It appears that [This.GetName], one of our agents deployed in [From.From.GetNameDef], has made the ultimate sacrifice and died in the line of duty. Reports from [From.From.GetAdjective] sources are naturally sparse, but it appears that [This.GetName] was being tracked by [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence. It seems likely that [This.GetSheHe] was about to be captured and either choose death to avoid giving out vital information under interrogation or was killed by [From.From.GetAdjective] agents while resisting arrest."
 lar_operative_event.3.a: "A hero, called to [This.GetHerHis] final rest."
 lar_operative_event.4.t: "Agent Injured"
 lar_operative_event.4.desc: "Following a close encounter with [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence, [This.GetName] has reported that [This.GetSheHe] will be out of action for a while to tend to the injuries [This.GetSheHe] sustained while fighting off an attempt to detain [This.GetHerHim]. \n\n[This.GetName] is now in a safe location, tending to [This.GetHerHis] wounds, and will be unavailable for a few weeks while [This.GetSheHe] recovers."
 lar_operative_event.4.a: "[This.GetSheHe] will be back in the fight soon enough."
 lar_operative_event.5.t: "Enemy Agent turned"
 lar_operative_event.5.desc: "Our counter-intelligence service has achieved a major success: following extensive interrogation, and upon being informed of [This.GetHerHis] likely fate if [This.GetSheHe] was charged with espionage, the captured [From.From.GetAdjective] agent [This.GetName] has agreed to cooperate with us in return for a full amnesty of [This.GetHerHis] crimes against the state.\n\nWith [This.GetHerHis] in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of the [From.From.GetAdjective] intelligence services, [This.GetSheHe] will no doubt find it much easier to infiltrate [From.From.GetNameDef] and remain undetected by [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence."
 lar_operative_event.5.a: "But we expected [This.GetHerHim] to die?"
 lar_operative_event.6.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Operative Captured!"
 lar_operative_event.6.desc: "[This.GetName] has been caught attempting to infiltrate our administration and leak secret information back to [This.GetHerHis] superiors. Upon interrogation, [This.GetSheHe] revealed [This.GetHerselfHimself] to be a foreign asset for [From.GetAgency] operating on [From.From.GetAdjective] soil. It is still yet unknown what the exact nature of [From.GetAdjective] interest in our nation is or what sections of our administration have already been exposed to the eyes of [From.GetAdjective] Intelligence. With [This.GetName] imprisoned and awaiting further interrogation, we can only hope that eventually [This.GetSheHe] will reveal all there is to know of [From.GetAdjective] operations in [From.From.GetNameDef]."
 lar_operative_event.6.a: "We have ways of making you talk."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_PIERRE_RYCKMANS_DESC:0 "The Highborn Lord Pierre, 1st Graff Ryckmans, has served the Flandro-Wallonian government for most of his life, as has his family before him for generations back home in Flanders. Born in 1891, Ryckmans comes from a family of esteemed lawyers and politicians, with his father Alphonse serving as a prominent senator in the Flandro-Wallonian Senate as a member of the Catholic Party. His father’s views deeply impacted Ryckmans from a young age, going on to study philosophy at the Catholic University of Leuven before hopping around schools between Germany, Ireland, and Flanders-Wallonia before the horrors of the Weltkrieg began, inspiring him to voluntarily enlist. Originally assigned to the Yser Front, Ryckmans long held an idealized admiration for the Dark Continent and applied to transfer to the colonies for overseas service as soon as he was able. It was here on the battlefields of Africa that Ryckmans made a name for himself as a sound tactician and leader as he fought back against both European soldiers and Mwami warriors, paving the way for his future colonial career post-war. After briefly returning home to finish his law degree and to write and publish the first of his literary works and memoirs, Ryckmans returned to the Congo and was soon elected to become the mayor of Herminestadt - one of the Congo’s largest cities and the main administrative center in the colony. Now, having proven his effectiveness and worth, Pierre Ryckmans serves as Governor-General of the Congo Vrijstaat. Under his leadership, colonial rule shall be maintained at all costs as Ryckmans attempts to drag the ailing Vrijstaat into the modern era."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_CONGO_DESC:0 "Albert I is known by many monikers: Le Roi-Chevalier, Der Koning-Soldaat, Heir to Leopold, and the Exiled King of the Flandro-Wallonians. These titles and honorifics have been bequeathed to him by his people’s adoration, his Godsent birthright, and his valorant acts in the Weltkrieg; and yet this noble ‘Soldier King’ has languished in exile while a German pretender sits on his throne. With the collapse of the previous colonial order under the ‘stewardship’ of the Kaiser’s forces, the Congo Vrijstaat has once again fully returned to the hands of its rightful Flandro-Wallonian masters, free from German meddling for the first time in decades. With this return of the proven pre-Weltkrieg status-quo, the Frandro-Wallonian loyalists within the Vrijstaat made overtures to their exiled king, who has long lived in Canada with the bulk of the Entente exiles, welcoming the Knight King Albert I back to the lands of Leopold’s free state and the center of the once mighty Flandro-Wallonian colonial empire. Though still far from Brussels and his throne, Albert I, rightful King of the Flandro-Wallonians, shall use the Congo as his new staging ground as he and his forces gather their strength to finally overthrow the vile German-backed regime that has stolen his homeland and his birthright from him. The mistakes of the Weltkrieg will be undone as Albert readies to fight for his people and his nation against the wicked Hun for the second time in his honored life."
POLITICS_VON_EPP_DESC:0 "With a career forged in war and colonial conquest, few men are more fit to lead one of the Kaiser’s glorious Afrikan colonies than Franz Ritter von Epp. A Bavarian man through and through, Epp was born in Munich in 1868 to famous realist painter Rudolf Epp, but quickly departed from his father’s artistic pursuits and joined the Munich Military Academy after graduating from school, beginning his storied military career. First seeing life action during the Boxer Rebellion, he would later see multiple deployments across Africa and Asia, most notable of which was his role in the vicious war against the Herero and Namaqua peoples of Südwestafrika. After this long term of colonial service, Epp was drafted into the fires of the Weltkrieg, seeing action in Serbia, Romania, Italy, and France, displaying such valourous and heroic acts that he was knighted by the Kaiser himself following the end of the war. Since then, von Epp has received higher and higher positions throughout His Majesty’s empire, and has now found himself as Staathalter of all of Mittelafrika. Under his rule, German interests shall be paramount above all else as Dar-Es-Salaam draws closer to Berlin."
POLITICS_VON_EPP_CONGO_DESC:0 "With a career forged in war and colonial conquest, few men are more fit to lead one of the Kaiser’s glorious Afrikan colonies than Franz Ritter von Epp. A Bavarian man through and through, Epp was born in Munich in 1868 to famous realist painter Rudolf Epp, but quickly departed from his father’s artistic pursuits and joined the Munich Military Academy after graduating from school, beginning his storied military career.

Since then, von Epp has received higher and higher positions throughout His Majesty’s empire, and has now found himself leading the colonial administration of the Congo. Under his rule German interests shall be paramount above all else as Leopoldville draws closer to Berlin."
POLITICS_LEO_PETILLON_DESC:0 "Léon ‘Léo’ Pétillon is a career civil-servant and once-staunch ally of Pierre Ryckmans, but following his predecessor’s fall from grace, Pétillon has risen to become the new Governor-General of the Congo. Born in 1903 in Esneux, Léo spent his youth slowly training to become a lawyer before joining the Ministry of the Colonies for colonial service in 1929. Since then, Pétillon steadily rose through the ranks of the colonial hierarchy due to his ties to chief ministers in the Flandro-Wallonian parliament and his sharp aptitude for colonial governance. With the fall of the previous cabinet, Pétillon was chosen as the natural successor to Ryckmans’ failed attempt at pseudo-military rule under the Force Publique, and with his technocratic beliefs established during his time as a lawyer and his staunch adherence to Catholicism well-known, the new Governor-General has been seen by many as the humanizing face the Vrijstaat has long sorely needed. Now, the people of the Congo watch Pétillon like a hawk, hoping to see if he is the blessing he truly seems to be."

### Focuses ###
COG_Colonial_Rule:0 "Fight the Mwami's Influence"
COG_Colonial_Rule_desc:0 "The Mwami has been defeated and Colonial Rule has been established. Tensions are high however between the Flemish-Wallonians and the native Congolese population who urge for the abolition of European patronalisation."
COG_Dominer_Pour_Servir:0 "Dominer pour Servir"
COG_Dominer_Pour_Servir_desc:0 "'Rule so we can Serve'. These simple words define the colonial policy that the old Belgian government decreed in the Congo. The Congolese are our children and we have to raise and lift them so they too can enjoy the virtues of Western Progress. This is a slow proces and while it hopes to reward the Congolese in the end, colonial rule isn't supposed to disappear for many more years."
COG_Restoration_Missions:0 "Restoration of the Missions"
COG_Restoration_Missions_desc:0 "Due to aggressive German policies against the power of the catholic church, many of our mission posts have been abandoned. Now that we are back in control, our catholic associates are urging us to request new missionaries from Flanders-Wallonia so we can further develop our 'Dominer pour Servir' program."
COG_Continue_Mission_To_Civilise:0 "Continue the Mission to Civilise"
COG_Continue_Mission_To_Civilise_desc:0 "It is our task to civilise the Dark Continent and while the German regime has helped them stray from the light of God, the time has returned to continue our task and bring Africa (slowly) into the future."
COG_Reward_The_Evolues:0 "Reward the Evolués"
COG_Reward_The_Evolues_desc:0 "It has become clear that we Europeans are not going to remain in Africa forever. Therefore we have to prepare the African population for their approaching independence. By educating and promoting the Evolués, we can secure that a transfer of power can be executed both peacefully and without economic depression."
COG_Elections_Herminestadt:0 "Allow Free Elections in the Congo"
COG_Elections_Herminestadt_desc:0 "The only way to consolidate power and satisfy our German overlords is to allow for free and fair elections within the colony. If we are truly a continuation of the Belgian state in Africa, we must appease our white middle class by letting them participate in local democracy."
COG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap:0 "Abolish the Invisible Colour Gap"
COG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap_desc:0 "While unlike the British or French colonies there never was a distinct colour gap in Congo, a glass ceiling blocked the Congolese from reaching high administrative or political positions. To combat the unrest that this has caused, the new progressive government has started efforts to break through these traditions and has started training the Evolués to replace some of the strictly European posts."
COG_Union_Miniere_Haut_Katanga:0 "Overhaul Union Minière de Haut-Katanga"
COG_Union_Miniere_Haut_Katanga_desc:0 "Not only is the UMHK the largest employer in our country, nearly all of economy relies on this company. Te secure a steady stream of income to the state, the UMHK is to be further integrated in the state and expanded upon."
COG_Expand_Ruashi_Mine:0 "Expand the Ruashi Mines"
COG_Expand_Ruashi_Mine_desc:0 "Due to the increasing importance of Copper in Europe, our mining operations have been expanding to meet demands. The Ruashi mine, which opened in 1911, has been one of our main copper and cobalt mines in the Congo and is in dire need of further expansion. To further guarantee prosperity for our own people, the government has also decided to expand the nearby refining industry and a such provide jobs."
COG_Limit_Native_Careers:0 "Limit Native Careers"
COG_Limit_Native_Careers_desc:0 "Unlike many of the other colonial powers, the UMHK allowed natives to operate the heavy machinery and held large training programs to successfully educate the workforce. A Katangese worker could climb up to become a machine operator or a clerk but was then limited by the Belgian leadership to avoid losing control over the organisation."
COG_Educate_Native_Engineers:0 "Educate Native Engineers"
COG_Educate_Native_Engineers_desc:0 "German reforms in the last decades have greatly changed the consciousness of the Katangese population. They now demand equal jobs and equal pay as European workers and are strengthened in their demands by the new government. Therefore the UMHK is opening up engineering positions to all of our citizens and created a schooling program with professors from the universities of Liège and Gent."
COG_Increase_Cobal_Production:0 "Increase the Cobalt Production"
COG_Increase_Cobal_Production_desc:0 "With rising arms production around the world and the great importance of Cobalt for modern technology, the UMHK has decided to open three more mines around the city of Herminestadt to meet these demands and to further propel ourselves to become the prime exporter of this rare earth material."
COG_Apoint_District_Overseers:0 "Appoint District Overseers"
COG_Apoint_District_Overseers_desc:0 "Due to the collapse of the German regime, many of our administrative structures and personnel have been dissolved or killed. As our economy relies quite heavily on the local chiefs and their influence, we need trained personnel to communicate with and oversee these Chefs and make them fall in line."
COG_Resinstate_The_Chefferies:0 "Reinstate the Chefferies"
COG_Resinstate_The_Chefferies_desc:0 "The system of Chefferies consisted of a rigid network of Colonial personnel and local chiefs. Once every few weeks, one of our district officials was to visit all the villages in his district and collect the gathered resources and speak law in name of the central government."
COG_Install_Farming_Quotas:0 "Install Farming Quotas"
COG_Install_Farming_Quotas_desc:0 "To feed the growing urban populations of Bunkeya and Herminestadt, we have to impose strict farming quotas on the chefferies. These will then be collected by personnel of the colonial government in exchange for money and commodities and transfered to the cities."
COG_Centre_Extra_Coutumiers:0 "Centre Extra-Coutumiers"
COG_Centre_Extra_Coutumiers_desc:0 "While the system of Chefferies worked well in the past, the growing population and the questionable loyalty of the cheffs has pushed the government to create their own economic centres on the countryside. These will take over the task of the chefferies and will be the centre for legal, economic and social gathering."
COG_Monopolise_Agricultural_Companies:0 "Monopolise Agricultural Companies"
COG_Monopolise_Agricultural_Companies_desc:0 "Currently our agricultural industry constitutes of farming quotas implaced on the villages and the collection of these whenever the district manager passes by the village. This has proven an unreliable system and doesn't have the efficiency and output of modern farming. Therefore the government has approved the creation of a state company like the UMHK to control this industry."
COG_Increase_Taxation:0 "Increase Taxation"
COG_Increase_Taxation_desc:0 "The Depression of Black Monday still looms over the Congo and requests both from within the nation and Flanders-Wallonia itself have asked for a temporary increased level of taxation to help the recovering economy."
COG_Modernize_Bunkeya:0 "Modernise Bunkeya"
COG_Modernize_Bunkeya_desc:0 "While Bunkeya is our capital, the city of Herminestadt is the true heart of the Congo. To increase the importance of Bunkeya and with the approval of the Mwami, the colonial government has started large scale construction projects in the city to bring it to the 20th century and permit easies development of the surrounding lands."
COG_Technical_University_Herminestadt:0 "Technical University of Herminestadt"
COG_Technical_University_Herminestadt_desc:0 "Due to the large growth of the UMHK over the last years, they have offered the government a large amount of funds to help in the creation of a technical university in Herminestadt. Requests for teachers and further funding have been sent to Flanders-Wallonia and have been met with large approval of the Flemish-Wallonian population sending their expertise and capital to develop the Congo."
COG_Connect_Bunkeya_Herminestadt:0 "Electrify Bunkeya-Herminestadt"
COG_Connect_Bunkeya_Herminestadt_desc:0 "Our two main cities are disconnected from each other making communication and transport very difficult. Therefore the railway Bunkeya-Herminestadt is to be expanded enabling larger amounts of both goods and people to use the line."
COG_The_Colonial_Trinity:0 "The Colonial Trinity"
COG_The_Colonial_Trinity_desc:0 "All power in the colony lies with the three Pillars of modern society: Church, Capital and Order. The Church provides spiritual and basic education, Capital offers them job opportunities, creates commodities and sustains their everyday needs while Order keeps those that step out of line from spreading their message."
COG_Patronisation_of_the_Natives:0 "Patronisation of the Natives"
COG_Patronisation_of_the_Natives_desc:0 "The Congolese citizen is less developed than his European counterpart and needs careful assistance to guide them on his path. Media and newspapers have to be censored to make them model citizens and government functions are best kept away from them until they have earned their civilisation certificate."
COG_Control_All_Aspects_of_Modern_Life:0 "Control all Aspects of Modern Life"
COG_Control_All_Aspects_of_Modern_Life_desc:0 "The UMHK controls all aspects of its workers lives. They work in its mines, eat in its cantinas, buy their groceries in its stores. Housing is provided to all workers as well as support for the wife and children of the miner. While this has provided a life of certain welfare to the miners, a sudden crisis in the company not only removes their jobs but their whole lives."
COG_Embrace_Congolese_Belgian_Culture:0 "Congolese-Belgian Melting Pot"
COG_Embrace_Congolese_Belgian_Culture_desc:0 "Herminestadt has grown to become a hub for both Flemish-Wallonians and Katangese who all live next to each other. The old European quarter and the cité indigène have been dismantled and have paved the way for large avenues and a larger feeling of cohesion between the natives and the colonials."
COG_Improve_Native_Living_Standards:0 "Improve Native Living Standards"
COG_Improve_Native_Living_Standards_desc:0 "With jobs and pay equal for both natives and colonials, the overall welfare of the population has risen. Due to the blooming copper mining buisness and new mining techniques from universities all across Mittel-Europa, working conditions have also improved dramatically paving the way for the 8-hour workday."
COG_Equals_For_The_Law:0 "Equals for the Law"
COG_Equals_For_The_Law_desc:0 "No longer shall a Congolese citizen be punished harder for the same crime as his colonial counterpart. With the introduction of a completely new legal system, borrowing heavily from the Flemish-Wallonian, the rights of all men are guaranteed."

COG_Stability_Force_Publique_desc:0 "Due to the chaos that ensued in the wake of the Mwamis rebellion, the Flemish-Wallonians in Herminestadt quickly reformed the Force Publique out of the ashes of German askaris to resist his attack. While we successfully repulsed their assault, the FP is only a shadow of its former self."
COG_A_European_Army:0 "A European Army"

COG_An_African_Army_desc:0 "The end of Colonialism is approaching and we need to secure a well-trained corps bolstered with local officers to make sure the nation doesn't fall into disarray after our departure."
COG_Heavy_Equipement:0 "Heavy Equipement"
COG_Heavy_Equipement_desc:0 "To assist in the defence of our cities and the attack of foreign strongholds, we need artillery to support our advancing troops."
COG_Arsenal_Herminestadt:0 "Build the Arsenal of Herminestadt"

COG_Restoration_Force_Publique:0 "Restoration of the Force Publique"
COG_Restoration_Force_Publique_desc:0 "In spite of their controversial history, the Force Publique has once again proved vital in maintaining order against the chaos of Africa. By restoring the structure of European officers we can ensure that the new Force Publique retains the respect and ability of its Belgian predecessors."
COG_Learn_From_East_Africa_Offensive:0 "Learn from the East-Afrika Offensive"
COG_Learn_From_East_Africa_Offensive_desc:0 "While the initial campaigns of the FP proved successful against the German forces, the collapse of the British and the subsequent failure of the Western Front forced us in disbanding the corps. Now that the corps is reinstated, it's time to learn from our failures and adapt."
COG_Secure_Our_Investements:0 "Secure our Investments"
COG_Secure_Our_Investements_desc:0 "We may have lost the Congo but we will not let African war chiefs undo all of our hard labour. If they cannot guarantee a free market, we will persuade them on the field."

COG_Access_To_The_Sea:0 "Access to the Sea"
COG_Access_To_The_Sea_desc:0 "Our economy is primarily based around the sale and export of the various resources and materials extracted from the rich Congo. For this to continue, sea access is vital, but yet there is an obstacle to this goal - there is but one large seaport in all of the Congo. Unfortunately, recent developments in Leopoldville have left our main port at Matadi non operational. We must find a way to export our goods or else our fragile economy could slip further into collapse."

COG_Luanda_Port:0 "Economic Support from Portugal"
COG_Luanda_Port_desc:0 "A solution to our financial problems lies in opening up to powers outside of Mittelafrika, especially Portugal, which is an undeniable maritime trading power that is also close to us territorially thanks to the colony of Angola to the south. With their economic support we can develop our economic assets and solve our financial crisis while being less dependent on the Germans, which some of the more pro-German members of our administration criticize."
COG_Trade_Mission_Portugal:0 "Send a Trade Mission to Portugal"
COG_Trade_Mission_Portugal_desc:0 "With the influence of the Kaiserreich ever continuing to waver and wane here on the Dark Continent, the appeal of German business ties has diminished. Unlike Germany, Portugal still largely remains in control of its African holdings to our east and west. Their support and economic assistance is essential to maintaining our independence, and so a trade delegation shall be sent to Lisbon to discuss a possible deal."
COG_Pink_Map_Negotiations:0 "Pink Map Negotiations"
COG_Pink_Map_Negotiations_desc:0 "With the evermore chaotic world situation developing as it has, Portugal has begun to pursue its old colonial claim to our region.

COG_POR_Submission:0 "O Congo é Nosso"
COG_POR_Submission_desc:0 "Despite protests from anti-imperialist elements within the nation, our regime has decided to work with the Portuguese. We have accepted Portuguese protection in exchange for broad autonomy and economic assistance. Let us reap the benefits of this controversial agreement and put our new funds to good use to build up the Congo with the help of our new benefactors, the Congo is now theirs as much as it is ours."
COG_Herminestadt_Luanda_Railroad:0 "Expand the Herminestadt-Luanda Railway"
COG_Herminestadt_Luanda_Railroad_desc:0 "Herminestadt and Portuguese Angola are separated by a mere few hundred miles of relatively clear and flat terrain - a practical stone’s throw away on this massive continent, and yet no rail connections exist. With our ample manpower reserves fueling our labour force and Portuguese financial backing funding the project, we shall have a rail line at last that connects Angola and Congo like never before, de-isolating our primordial paradise just a little more."

COG_Support_Kongo:0 "Support the Manikong"
COG_Support_Kongo_desc:0 "Kitanga has always been at least nominally part of the colony of the Congo. This presents both advantages and disadvantages - on one hand, we retain connections to the elite of Kinshasa where the new Kongolese regime is based, on the other, that gives them a basis on which to assert control over us. We must come to an agreement with the Manikong to stop this."
COG_Send_Division_Manikongo:0 "Arm the Tribes"
COG_Send_Division_Manikongo_desc:0 "It is in our best interest to ensure that the regime in Kinshasa survives its present conflict. While we possess few arms, we should send what we can spare to them."
COG_Boma_Port:0 "The Port of Boma"
COG_Boma_Port_desc:0 "Infrastructure is already in place to carry goods from the Congo, the river port city of Boma. We should approach the Mamikong about reopening these old routes on a permanent basis."
COG_Join_Kongolese_War:0 "Join in the Kongolese Civil War"
COG_Join_Kongolese_War_desc:0 "As Kinshasa and Kivu fight, they both grow weaker. We can now strong arm our old allies in Kinshasa for recognition in exchange for support in their current conflict."

COG_German_Connections:0 "Rekindle Connections with the Kaiserreich"
COG_German_Connections_desc:0 "German rule was beneficial for the Mwami and the the Congon ruling class. We should continue to work closely with them."
COG_Daressalam_Port:0 "German Bailout"
COG_Daressalam_Port_desc:0 "In order to develop our falling economy and meet the needs created by our fragile financial situation, we should ask our German friends for a bailout, some criticize that this will make us more dependent on the Germans, but it is the simplest and most effective solution to our problems."
COG_Katanga_Tangyanika_Railroads:0 "Construct the Congo-Tanganyika Railway"
COG_Katanga_Tangyanika_Railroads_desc:0 "After our previous decision to ask for a bailout from the Germans, it is quite necessary that we continue our economic development alongside them. For this purpose it was decided by our administration and the central government of Mittelafrika to build a new railroad connecting Lubumbashi and Dar-Es-Salaam.  Such a project would have cost us a considerable amount of money, but the Germans have offered a generous financial support to this project which is mutually beneficial to us."

Self-sufficiency, local cooperation with other African states, and constructing our own native industry shall be key goals for our new economy.  What few funds we have should be directed, in partnership with our allies, towards the exploitation of the natural bounty of this land, for our own profit.

Though he started the Congo’s modernization and civilizing processes, turning the Congo into a profitable venture for rubber production, ivory sourcing, and mining, he did so through committing brutal acts against the native Congolese. Though harsh, Leopold II’s rule showed that in the Congo, profitable results required sacrifice, and so we will replicate his methods in a more modern and less barbaric way in order to further his civilizing mission here in the Congo."

From gold and silver to iron and uranium deposits to rubber tree forests that stretch for acres and underground deposits of oil and natural gas, the Congo is one of the most bountiful paradises on this planet - a true Eden on Earth. To ensure these resources are efficiently extracted and processed, the UMHK and other resource conglomerates in the Congo shall coalesce together into a central economic planning board, becoming an official arm of the state as the chief economic bureaucracy of the Congo.

Once again, we must rely on this colony's immense population to fuel the coming war effort and fill out our divisions. We must conscript the natives to work both in the factories and to hold a gun on the frontline, for without their manpower, our crusade to retake Brussels is doomed to fail.

Since then rubber plantations have grown to stretch across much of our colonies once-stocked and healthy rubber forests. Primarily in Bas-Congo, these plantations already stretch for hundreds of acres, producing liquid cash with each bucket of sap collected.

COG_German_Influence_desc:0 "With their victory in the Weltkrieg, Flanders-Wallonia and the Congo were forced to swear subservience to the new world hegemon. Though the Flandro-Wallonian administration in the Congo was allowed to stay and the reign of the Vrijstaat allowed to continue, the Kaiserreich quickly began to sink its greedy teeth into this resource-rich primordial oasis. With each passing moment, the German Empire further digs its claws into the Congo ever deeper, furthering their influence and fulfilling their own ambitions at the cost of the long-standing Flandro-Wallonian dominance that has existed since Leopold’s regime. Despite their best efforts, however, the influence of these Flandro-Wallonian imperialists and settlers is waning fast. \n\nThis atmosphere of crumbling chaos has come to minorly benefit the Congo, supplying the Force Publique with weapons and the colonial administration with economic aid, but has also greatly destabilized the colony and the very foundations of Flandro-Wallonian rule while also greatly inflaming native tensions who continue to riot and strike against colonial rule. An end to this struggle for dominance must be reached if the Vrijstaat is to survive at all."

congo.0.d:0 "For decades, the Flandro-Wallonians have been the sovereign lords of the Congo, since the reign of Leopold II to the modern Ryckmans regime enforced by the Force Publique. However, since ‘Belgium’s’ loss in the Weltkrieg, their nation and their empire have been subservient to the Kaiser’s will, for even Wilhelm’s own son sits upon the Belgian throne. With this new war-forged reality in place, the newly-minted Flandro-Wallonians were allowed to keep their colonial regime within the Congo intact and their hierarchies in one piece, but a new German element was forced into the system as overlords to the ingrained Belgian regime. \n\nOver the years since the Weltkrieg, German influence has increasingly weathered the foundations of the Flandro-Wallonian regime, and the current Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans has let the situation slowly spiral out of hand. With traditionalist insurrectionists waging a guerilla war in Katanga, Askari and small Socialist groups actively protesting and campaigning for independence in Kivu and the Capital, and with religious fanatics and rogue mercenaries gnawing at our roots in the North and West, the Vrijstaat’s current situation is dubious to say the least. Governor-General Ryckmans must quickly deal with the major issues affecting the colony lest it fall into chaos, yet with the mismanagement of Dar-Es-Salaam looming over us, it may be outside our control. Regardless, our regime must soldier on and preserve the Trinité Coloniale of God, Gold, and Civilization lest we collapse into savagery and chaos as the ever-present Hun further forces its presence."

The capital of the local colonial administrative province, Kamina was the local jewel of the Flandro-Wallonian regime, with a burgeoning merchant quarter and a vibrant tapestry and woodworking industry fueled by skilled native workers now employed by the colonials. All of this prosperity has been erased in the wake of the Mwami’s wrath, for he has resolved himself to make himself known in the minds of the imperialists forever as this aging king passes through his twilight years. On the eve of this week’s dawn, Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila commanded his forces to break their usual guerilla tactics to instead rally and march on the Kamina in a show of force. Quickly overwhelming the meager Force Publique garrison defending the city, these savage and bloodthirsty native warriors have begun to entrench deep in the heart of the city and along its Northern reaches as they burn the rest of this colonial hive to the ground. \n\nAs a result, hundreds of loyal colonials have been slaughtered and much of our economic and military assets within the city have been completely destroyed. We must now decide how best to deal with this act of violence, and with Governor-General Ryckmans’ regime barely holding together as in, this surely will be a test for his administration, for should he fail, the higher-ups back in Europe always have a list of possible replacements waiting..."

The German high colonial office has decreed that the Mwami and his meager band of loyalists is too small a threat to require direct aid from Germany, especially in such a dire time as this. With the fallout of Black Monday and rising tensions in Europe, the Kaiserreich is far too busy abroad to deal with us here in Afrika. It seems we are on our own."

Led by Franz Ritter von Epp, Reinhard Heydrich, and other disillusioned veterans within the Mittelafrikan administration and military. Long seeking their own power and sensing our growing position of weakness, von Epp has begun to make political moves within our regime, confirming our long-held suspicions that ‘the Kaiser’s Hand’ seeks power in the Congo for himself. Making their distaste for our rule official, von Epp and the NKR have officially denounced the Ryckmans administration, and have begun to openly and actively campaign both against Ryckmans and for von Epp as the next Governor-General of the Vrijstaat. Whether this posturing will remain empty threats or escalate into an actual political challenge remains to be seen, but with von Epp’s honors and reputation, he is not an opponent we want."

Now, it is only a matter of time before the enemy makes their move, or simply surrenders to our clearly superior forces."

With this atmosphere of division and in-fighting, we have been presented the perfect opportunity to strike as chaos consumes their ranks. As the preparations were finalized, Commander of the FP Léo Petillion began ordering our troops all along the Northern border of the city to begin the march as the flanks were covered by our supporting garrisons in the East and West. With this closing pincer, we shall push the Mwami’s forces back into the inferno they caused that still consumes the Southern districts. With their only avenue of escape cut-off and with their troops ready to mutiny and nearly out of supplies, the Mwami’s forces have become a cornered and wounded fox, and now all we need do is deliver the final blow!"

congo.25.d:0 "Charging at the Mwami’s disorganized lines, our loyal troops in the Force Publique crumbled the morally-broken natives, pushing them into the Southern blaze as Commander Petillion led his men in a savage reprisal campaign against the Mwami’s troops. Broken and routed, the few surviving native troops fled through back alleys and sewer passages to escape, taking with them the Mwami who was personally leading the forces within the city. Despite this snake slipping through our fingers once more, the bulk of his forces have been slaughtered or captured, and though Kamina still burns, we stand victorious!"

The city still burns, with artillery fire from our assault only adding to the inferno, with the fires now spreading into the city-center and the Eastern district as well. In the areas of the city not ablaze, rubble and the dead litter the streets where clean-up operations are slowly underway, and the smoke and stench from this horrific site can be seen and smelt for miles as the vultures and hyenas come to the city to feast upon the bounty of carrion. \n\nAcross the colony, the Ryckmans Regime has received nothing but backlash and criticism over this calamity, with much of the Vrijstaat blaming the Governor-General for the wanton destruction of a provincial capital and the deaths of hundreds of civilians - both colonials and native Congolese. With this newest disaster only being the latest in a long series of missteps and controversies, anticolonial sentiment is once again on the rise and many have begun to call for Ryckmans to resign and for another, more respected and competent colonial to take the reins of power, while others have even begun to call for native rule. Though Ryckmans is still solidly in command, and those who call for his resignation have little power, he and his administration must shape up and be wary, for the cracks are starting to show."

congo.27.d:0 "At last, after a long clean-up operation and reconstruction campaign, the city of Kamina has largely been restored, save for large amounts of tribal housing and farmlands that were forever lost in the raging inferno. The dead have been buried, the walls and merchant quarter have been restored, and the garrison forces have been relieved and replaced. Though outrage against the Ryckmans Regime is still raging, it has lessened since the initial conflict, and the relative calm that once existed here has begun to return. However, the Vrijstaat is still a disconnected, unstable, and chaotic colony, and new dangers are always awaiting around the corner..."
congo.27.a:0 "Colonial order is restored...for now."

congo.28.t:0 "The Great Leopoldville Riots"
congo.28.d:0 "With ire and discontent towards the colonial regime only growing with Ryckmans’ recent blunders, the nascent and infantile Congolese nationalist and home-rule movements have begun to skyrocket in popularity, largely driven on by a new generation of young firebrands both sick of the Évolués and their complacency, and with the colonials and their horrific and oppressive rule. With rising figures such as Joseph Kasa-Vubu and Moïse Tshombe championing regionalist ideas in opposition to nationalist unifiers like Daniel Kanza and Jean Bolikango as young radicals like Joseph Kasongo, Cyrille Adoula, and Isaac Kalonji leave their lives steeped in Western education and influence to stoke the fires of Socialist agitation, everywhere within the Congo has seen rising nativist agitation. However, this conflict and unrest is better showcased nowhere else than within the capital of the Vrijstaat - the great and grand African metropolis of Leopoldville. \n\nWith the recent controversies playing their part in furthering the colony-wide unrest, Leopoldville has become the chaotic and churning cauldron that lies at the source of this conflict, ready to bubble over and pour out of the city and into the wider Congo. At dawn this morning, the local Force Publique garrison under Armand Huyghé and Émille Janssens were met with far more than the regular protests and rabble as tens of thousands of angry ‘Kinshasans’ as they call themselves began to march on the colonial capital. Armed with captured colonial equipment and factory tools, this mass of native Congolese swarmed across the city, looting and rioting as they went in a pure and violent expression of anti-colonial sentiment that has been building for years. Notably, one local known as Leonard Mpoyi has made a name for himself by leading a charge into the FP garrisons, stealing weapons and supplies and distributing them to the other protestors. Though the situation has not spiraled out of control just yet, the FP remains every-vigiland, and more troops from outside the capital are being relocated closer to the city to act as support. Though these riots will likely be put down soon and these locals will return to their normal lives, this massive demonstration has shown our administration that the natives of the Congo are getting serious about sovereignty, and that their independence movements have clear leaders now pulling the strings behind the scenes."

congo.29.t:0 "Anti-Ryckmans Sentiment on the Rise"
congo.29.d:0 "Through damage control and careful diplomacy, we have attempted to fix the public-relations nightmare that the ‘Folly at Kamina’ has caused - and it has been a complete and utter failure. Disapproval and outrage against the Ryckmans’ Regime has never been higher, and what was once small and disconnected calls for new leadership or a change in direction have evolved and coalesced into a violent torrent of public outrage calling for Ryckmans’ resignation. Though the colonial administration has so-far pushed back on these calls for a new order in the Vrijstaat, they have still begun to prepare candidates for replacement just in case. Among the various Force Publique veterans, colonial administrators, and Old Guard generals in the running, two names have risen to the top above all others - Léo Petillion, one of the leading figures of the FP and the Hero of Kamina, and Franz Ritter von Epp, leading figure of the NKR and the ‘Kaiser’s Hand’ here in the Congo. Though Ryckmans is still Governor-General and his word is still law, he must watch his back lest his allies stab him in the back and throw him to the wolves as a scapegoat for the colony’s latest missteps."

Now, a formal request has been made by his government for support from our country. In the chaos that ensued after Black Monday, most of our citizens living and working in the Congo were able to escape to Herminestadt where the central power of our mining operations is located. Reports from the missions indicate that around 10.000 of our colonials were able to retreat to Herminestadt where they proclaimed Pierre Ryckmans as their colonial governor.

In sharp contrast to both these movements, the new and growing African Workers Party, under the lead of Léonard Mpoyi and Danizel Kanza, has also announced their bid for the position as well and have been seen swaying voters among the cité indigène.

These words embody the colonial mission here in the Vrijstaat, for the ultimate loyalty to their nation and their countrymen is to dominate the African continent, or at least the Congo colony, and all those who reside in it. This harsh doctrine is for the good of the Crown and for the good of the colony, for with colonization comes civilization, or so they say. \n\nIn response to the Mwami’s recent occupation of Kamina, the Ryckmans Regime has declared its intent to double-down on their doctrine of domination for profit and patriotism, flying in the face of recent calls for liberalizing measures to appease the rowdy savages. The Trinité Coloniale must be preserved at all costs, and the Ryckmans Regime is intent on doing everything in their power to uphold this mighty imperialist dynasty. Now if any Congolese group truly seeks independence, their only path to it shall be through violence, for it seems the era of White colonial rule is here to stay."

Due to their loss in Kamina earlier this year, his troops are widely undersupplied and lacking in even the most basic of equipment. Meanwhile, the Force Publique, though still widely armed with Weltkrieg-era weapons, has been preparing for this rising tide of unrest with new supplies from requisitioned Europe. It would seem that conflict within the Congo is far from over, and the Force Publique has been ordered to the lands of the Mwami once more to put down this foolish and aging king."

Meanwhile, the first trucks loaded with our troops have arrived in Bunkeya, and the city has been mostly secured without much bloodshed or pushback. A temporary airstrip has been created to accommodate the incoming Flandro-Wallonian paracommandos while a new plan of action is being formalised by the general staff of the Force Publique under Armand Huyghé and Émille Janssens."

In response to this decision and our forces growing anger over the loss of their fellow comrades in the Force Publique, General Émille Janssens had given the order to bomb the Munema fortress with planes and artillery before following up with a combined push by Flandro-Wallonian paracommandos and Force Publique foot soldiers. \n\nThe ancient fortress surely was not at all capable of resisting this type of modern, combined warfare and was first expected to fall within hours. However, in our foolish overconfidence, we had ordered our forces to wait to advance for the moment our bombs stopped falling on the old fortress, and in this brief window, the Mwami and a small detachment of his vanguard and closest advisors were able to slip away in old tunnels beneath the surface. The Mwami’s forces are routed, but his slippery chief has escaped our grasp once more, enraging the FP leadership. Regardless, his movement is too fractured to be any threat now, or so we hope."

With a burning sun shining on the supporters, the match began with a goal from Mokuna against the Flemish-Wallonian keeper. The Beerschot attackers were able to turn the tide around at the 42 minute mark scoring two goals against the failing Herminestadt defence, placing the score 2-1 at half-time. During the second half, three more attacks by Beerschot were blocked by the Herminestadt defence and Mokuna was able to score another goal at the 76 minute placing the final score at 2-2.

Insisting that they are naturally protected against low oxygen environments due to their mountainous home and don't need the 'Chambres à Vapeur' to acclimate to the situation down below, many of these men have died from loss of oxygen or malaria and secretly buried away from the general public. Now the study has leaked out to the population of Herminestadt resulting in a massive strike against the UMHK until better working conditions can be guaranteed.

Due to the expansion of the corporation over the years however this combination is no longer viable for the entire firm leading to loopholes and unjustified punitive measures against the wrong miner. After the economic crisis of 1936, many of the miners are now completely at the mercy of the company, depending on them for food, social facilities, accomodation. To cut back their losses, the UMHK decided to cut back spending for these facilities, causing a general decline in the welfare of the Katangese and increasing calls for better loans and houses now that the economy is back in upswing."

Organizing a meeting of the local paramount chiefs, tribal monarchs, and other autonomous indigeneous leaders within the Congo, Ryckmans and his administration hopes to soothe native-colonial relations once and for all to prevent more chaos and unrest from spreading within our colony. Seeking to adopt a policy of pragmatic association, the Governor hopes that by working with these local leaders instead of curbing their influence at every turn may be far more conducive to a stable and functional Vrijstaat. These leaders will be given further rights and autonomy as the colonial administration adopts a more agreeable and less oppressive attitude towards them. \n\nTo solidify this new atmosphere of cooperation, Ryckmans has called for a grand meeting and feast to be held in Leopoldville, inviting each and every of the hundreds of local tribal rulers, chiefs, and representatives from across our colony’s vast expanse. Giving a toast thanking each and every of the countless leaders by name, Ryckamns was nearly winded by the end of the feast’s inaugural speech, but with this token symbol of respect given and these new pragmatic policies passed, Ryckamns hopes to earn his true goal from these new policies: loyalty from the notoriously unruly native majority, but only time will tell if his new stance pays off."

Promising a slew of incentives and special exemptions for UMHK operations and properties, Ryckmans hopes to win the loyalty of these captains of industry with bribery and flattery, for without the help of these rich Belgians, the Vrijstaat’s economy would completely collapse. Though this will further tie ourselves to the whims of these greedy entrepreneurs and industrialists, it is a necessary evil to secure our prosperity and stability, and it’s not like we won’t benefit ourselves from these deals, for the UMHK and its dealings can be quite lucrative indeed."

However, the Congo colony continues to survive, and Flandro-Wallonian influence still holds strong in the face of the German hegemony in a carefully maintained balance entirely due to Governor Ryckmans tactful leadership and his ability to play the two imperialist powers off each other for the wider benefit of the Vrijstaat itself.

Mainly a modernization and westernization scheme, Plan Décennal seeks to, as the name suggests, revolutionize and massively expand the Congo’s economic and industrial sectors within a decade, bringing newfound prosperity and affluence to all the Congo. Never before has such an ambitious economic plan been seen here in Mittelafrika, especially one that would bring such widespread assistance and growth, for Pétillon’s plan not only seeks to aid the colonial population, but the vast majority of the Congo’s citizens as well, for in his eyes no living soul in this colony is exempt from assistance and the light of civilization. Functioning like a temporary planned economy built around a foundation of pro-entrepreneurial and Christian capitalist ideals, this 10-year Plan, if successful, would be one of the greatest economic miracles the world has ever seen, dragging tens of millions of Africans and colonials out of poverty on a scale never before witnessed. With the initial stages of the plan beginning to go into effect, the people of the Vrijstaat wait with bated breath to see if Pétillon’s scheme pays off, or if it fails like so many other past colonial ventures."

Calling for competent and colonial intelligentsia, technical experts, and educated holymen to run the economy and the colonial administration, these experts would organize themselves into sectors based on their own expertise and be responsible for overseeing and managing said sectors. Arguing that this system is not only more rational, but also far more productive, efficient, and above all, more conducive to a stable colonial order. To aid in the organization efforts of this new system, Pétillon and his friends in the PSC and PC back in Wallonia have also organized a system of voluntary Christian unions, allowing our workers to organize and cooperate without the threat of Socialism looming over our heads. With this new Technocratic system in place, Governor Pétillon hopes to modernize and civilize the Congo in the most efficient and productive way possible."

Not one to be inconsistent, Pétillon has applied this near-zealous appreciation for his religion to his colonial policy and diplomacy with the Vrijstaat’s lieges. Drawing on ties and allies made during his time in Flanders-Wallonia, Governor Pétillon garnered a great deal of support, foreign aid, and other useful political tools. Coming from the Catholic Church itself as well as his allies in Wallonia’s largest Christian parties, this endless stream of support is instrumental in keeping Pétillon’s regime afloat and stable. Maintaining these ties is of the utmost importance to the Wallonian Technocrat, and he has even been known to shirk other colonial duties simply to appease these benefactors, leaving their influence on the Vrijstaat undeniable.

An abstract concept more so than a set and single plan, this idea calls for a new order to overtake the Vrijstaat - one poised to take into account the needs and desires of both the African and Colonial populations equally and without bias. This ‘community’ would slowly endeavor to build a moderated and syncretic Congolese identity, formed from the two diverse halves that make up its whole, while simultaneously promoting a new equal standing among the Vrijstaat’s various ethnic and economic groups. Though fostering such a warm atmosphere of coexistence and cooperation shall be difficult to say the least in such a diverse and unruly colony, it is a necessity if the Vrijstaat is to survive.

With the Eagle’s return, ideas of Prussian Militarism and Germanic pride have begun to explode in popularity among the German colonials and their loyal Askari. To act on this growing wave of pro-German sentiment as well as the sudden influx of German military men, von Epp has enacted a mass militarization push across the colony, to finally bring the Vrijstaat’s military up to the standards of the Kaiserreich. Through new drills, training regimes, and even an entirely new officer class, the military of this colony shall come to exemplify the Prussian ideal as troops both green and veteran are imbued with this new spirit in newly constructed training camps across the nation.

Breaking many treaties and chiefly alliances along the way, von Epp has managed to anger most of the natives within the Congo, but with his renewed support from Berlin and the rising tide of Germanic militarism, the native Congolese can do little to stop von Epp and his ambitions."

These governors shall be drawn from von Epp’s allies in the NKR, his loyal generals and friends in the Force Publique, and even the occasional paramount chief or askari veteran that has proven their loyalty to the colonial system. This system of neo-feudalism shall work to better organize the Vrijstaat while delegating the great burden of administering this vast expanse.

Forming a third of the colonial trinity, it is no shock that we should grant them their rightful due. Be it the granting of vast swaths of land to use how they see fit, the sponsoring of missionary orders to bring the light of Our Blessed Lord to the entirety of the Congo, our lordship over the Congo has done more for the Church than any in history. With our sudden expansion of the Church's influence within the Congo, many have begun calling for the formal establishment of a Congolese Hierarchy. Since 1919, the Congo has been under an Apostolic vicariate based out of Leopoldville, a measure meant to only last until the local population has become significant Catholic to warrant the installment of a bishop. With our population now nearly half catholic, many feel the time has come to move forward, and create a series of Dioceses around the Congo.  While such a move is normally reserved for the Church,  due to our massive entanglement, we could in essence coerce the Church to establish these various dioceses. Of course such an action would undoubtedly cause a bit of strife, after all these dioceses would no doubt begin recruiting native bishops, an act that could start sprouting ideas of independence, an abhorrent idea to anyone within our administration. Regardless, the Church is no stronger than even within the Congo, and it will only be a matter of time until a native hierarchy is established, no matter our decision."

Just last week, Governor [CON.getleader] took a tour of the local arsenal and military base located within the capital of Leopoldville. What was supposed to be a regular excursion for publicity turned into a full inventory search as the Governor was shocked to find that most of the capital’s arsenal - the main arsenal in the colony - was still largely stocked with antique museum pieces and relic weapons leftover from the Weltkrieg and before. This harsh realization has sent the Governor and his regime into a frenzy, starting a mass modernization effort across the Vrijstaat in order to bring the mighty Force Publique up to today’s standards. Though this effort will be quite expensive and take a while to fully finance and complete, it will be well worth it to ensure the Congo is secured and safe. As we erect these new factories, gunsmiths, military academies, training fields, weapons labs, and other facets of a contemporary military, we will know that our money is going to a worthy use."

Leopold II was the greatest monarch the Belgian people have ever known, and we must look to this titan of imperialism as an example to match and even surpass if possible. We shall copy his techniques and the techniques of the colonial regime and Force Publique he once lorded over, modernizing them along the way so they can be folded into our doctrine and policy and implemented into the use in the Vrijstaat. We shall rekindle this lost colonialist spirit while making profits hand over fist, forging the current Vrijstaat into a refined and perfected form of its old self.

No longer shall the Vrijstaat be only protected by a mere security force. Our new armed forces shall apply the latest tactics and supplies from the homeland in Europe and use them to great effect against our enemies here on the Dark Continent.

Luckily for us, within the Congo there exists a company large and prosperous enough to finance this surge for self-sufficiency - the UMHK. Comprising just over 70% of our national economy, the UMHK is one of Africa’s largest companies, for no company moves as much ore and as much precious minerals as these industrious colonials. Composed of a mixed council of Belgian, Anglo, German, and even Dutch and French economists and business leaders, the UMHK’s Board of Directors is an imposing force to bargain with, but Governor-General [COG.getleader] is determined to make these corporatists bend. Through hard diplomacy, hostile business negotiations, and even through the threat of force from the Force Publique, our regime has made these captains of industry see the light, and with their aid, we shall build the Congo into a self-sustaining and free-standing new nation here in Africa."

In a grand meeting in the capital, Governor [COG.getleader] has worked tirelessly through days of debate and politicking in order to secure oaths of loyalty and support from the main paramount chiefs and prominent Congolese leaders. In exchange for sweeping reforms to Belgo-Congolese relations, increased autonomy and economic freedoms for most tribal kingdoms and protectorates, and other token concessions, these various Congolese groups have promised to provide men and supplies to the coming war effort. However, these small changes to the overall colonial relationship with the native Congolese was not the tipping point that allowed such a historic deal - for that, the colonials had to promise that the Congo as a whole would be granted self-rule under the colonial regime once and if Brussels was retaken, effectively making the Congo an equal, self-represented entity within the Belgian colonial empire. Though this compromise angered much of the Force Publique’s officer corps and military staff, as well as our more conservative colonial administrators, it was a necessary concession to ensure the support and loyalty of these much-needed native groups. Together, through gritted teeth and uneasy cooperation, we shall retake our homeland, and then we can reapproach this delicate situation."

Those who had survived the brutal raid woke to find their village in shambles, their compatriots and family members murdered, and the culprits nowhere to be found despite leaving taunting graffiti and plenty of evidence behind. This attack worryingly is not the first of its kind, for anti-German sentiment has been on the rise for weeks now with no end in sight, and though it does not seem the Belgian colonials are directly behind this wave of hate crimes and violence, they do not seem too keen on putting a complete stop to it, for less Germans admittedly makes their jobs easier as their main rivals no longer jockey with them for power. Worse still, it would seem many of these attacks are perpetrated by members of the Force Publique, further bloodying their hands and worsening their reputation with the people.

Calling for a renewed settlement and colonization drive, the regime of Governor-General [COG.getleader] has moved to showcase the Congo as the perfect place for any seeking a fresh start. Incentivizing this settlement with land grants, seed funds, lowered tax rates, bundles of starting equipment - including tools, camping gear, hunting rifles, beasts of burden - and whatever else these new colonials would need, the government has poured everything it can spare to attract new European souls into the Vrijstaat.

congofla.39.d:0 "To say the Congo was without faith would be perhaps one of the most idiotic statements one could make. Be it the Catholicism of the Belgians and French, the Lutheranism of the Germans, or even the myriad faiths of the natives, be it pagan or syncretic, the people of the Congo are at their core a people of faith. With the recent conclusion of the civil war however, that faith has been greatly shaken in all but the most ardent believers. What kind of loving God or Gods would allow the evils, the horrors, the atrocities that followed in the wake of the civil war?\n\nThis question, and the reality of life in the post-war Congo has begun many to openly question their faiths, with some turning to agnosticism and in the worse cases, atheism. This poses two problems for us, the first being political in nature, the other more spiritual.  Politically speaking, atheism and agnosticism is dangerous in the fact that it calls the whole civilizing mission into question. While before we could vaguely justify our actions in terms of spreading both the Gospel and Western Civilization to these poor souls. If atheism were to become the norm, that justification is gone, and the nasty ideas of /"Freedom"/ and /"Independence"/ would no doubt spread like wildfire among the natives, perhaps allowing that demonic ideology of Syndicalism to spread to these primordial soils.. Should such an event take place, our rule would end quicker then it began. It was only due to their inexperience that the Kivu revolt failed, should it happen again, we would stand nearly no chance. On the spiritual side, atheism and growing agnosticism poses perhaps the largest threat to man's immortal soul. While sin is a horrible action that cuts man off from God, man can always return God viva repentance. For the atheist and agnostic however, the way back is much harder, and salvation is nigh impossible.\n\nWith these problems in mind, and in hopes of bringing unity that has been lost since the civil war, the Vrijstaat under [COG.GetLeader] has begun a series of programs to restore both trust in God and to bring deeper religious unity amongst the various groups that inhabit the Congo. While taking all forms and shapes, everything from missionary tours to easing religious restrictions, the most prominent of these programs is the so-called /"Light out of Darkness"/ program.  In essence, the program seeks to answer the question of why God allows evil to occur. Taking inspiration from both Catholic and Protestant sources, the program answers this question by stating it takes great pain for good to come about. Christ's passion was a horrid, bloody thing, but if it had not occurred man would not have been saved, and Christ would not have risen from the dead. So too must the Congo suffer a similar passion, but in the end after so much strife and horror, she will rise again, more glorious and powerful than before.\n\nWhile the programs are still in their infancy, unity among the various Christian groups within the Congo has never been higher, and it is predicted that in only a few years, the faith and morale of the Congolese will be higher than ever before."

Kissing the ring of the Kaiser before finally rising, von Epp swore to his liege that so long as he himself still draws breath, there shall be no peace for the enemies of the Kaiser in Africa, and that from his new exile home in the Congo, von Epp would continue the Kaiser’s African ambitions, even if it’s the last thing he would do. With their meeting over, von Epp said farewell to his favored liege and embarked back on a trek back to Leopoldville, for the Kaiser’s Hand had much to do and prepare for. Under von Epp’s command, the Congo has become the last major bastion of loyal German colonialism in Africa, and von Epp was certain he would not let this final bulwark fall."

Insead, the Kaier’s eyes were met with hostile words and damning accusations of incompetence, for von Epp had finally had enough. Forsaking his Kaiser and his homeland, von Epp has announced that in the wake of Mittelafrika’s collapse, he is turning his back on the Kaiserreich for good. Instead, von Epp seeks to chase his own desires and ambitions within his new fiefdom in the Congo, fully renouncing his oath of loyalty to the German Crown. \n\n Finally done reading, the Kaiser was sent into a blind rage, practically frothing at the mouth in a deranged tantrum over the loss of not only one of the Kaiserreich’s most important colonial possessions, but also over the loss of one of his most favored generals and one of his oldest friends. Collapsing to the floor exhausted, the Kaiser fixed himself and his attire, and began to exclaim wildly that Africa was not lost and that the Kaiserreich would last a thousand years or more - ravings of madman backed into a corner and forced to face the crumbling reality around him. With this declaration, von Epp now stands as the sole leader of this new Congo; its Erzkanzler who shall illuminate their new way through the Dark Heart of Africa."

It was his Catholic faith that brought him to prominence within the Congo, and it was his faith that led him to start his reconquest of former Mittleafrika. Today, his faith has brought him to Rome, to a private audience with His Holiness, the Pope. The exact details of von Epp's meeting with His Holiness are unknown, but it is believed the Archchancellor sought his blessing for his attempts to revive the Holy Roman Empire on the African continent. While we can't be certain, just two short days after the meeting, the Successor of Saint Peter announced his complete and total support for von Epp's crusade, asking any and all faithful Catholics who could, to make their way to von Epp's Congo, and aid him on his journey. Further, the Bishop of Rome granted to the future Holy African Emperor the title of King of the Romans, a title once held by the Holy Roman Emperors of old. With His Holiness' blessing, it is expected that morale among the troops is too skyrocket. With the Pope's call for men to take up arms and aid us, we can expect at least a small trickle of men to begin arriving on our shores, fighting to restore Christendom, in Afrika."

The Congo is the last strong bastion of German colonial rule in Africa, and von Epp shall ensure that this bulwark does not falter. Naming himself the new Staathalter of the newly forged German Congo, this jungle paradise shall be transformed into a living, nation-wide fortress. With von Epp at the helm, militarization and centralization policies shall be pushed heavily as the Congo is slowly made more German due to the intake of fleeing remnants of the failing colonial order. The colonial missions of profit and faith shall be exemplified and pursued mercilessly as we convert every living soul we can to the Christian faiths and expand the economy once dominated by the UMHK. The Congo shall be forged into a steely heart at the center of Africa, and from atop its highest towers, Staathalter von Epp shall guide us through these troubled times and into a more secure future."

Rising as the new Erzkanzler, von Epp has announced the creation of the ‘Heiliges Afrikanisches Reich’, or the Holy African Empire. Modeled on the historic HRE, this new empire rises over the ashes of the old Mittelafrikan order, seeking to bring prosperity, culture, tradition, and respect to the various peoples and colonial remnants of Africa. \n\nRejecting European ties fully, Erzkanzler von Epp seeks to forge this HAR into a formidable and respected new empire free from the sins and failures of the old monarchs and republics that have failed the modern West. Forming a new Imperial Diet and breaking the lands of our former-colony into new Reichsgau, or imperial states, the political and social landscape of Africa shall slowly move to emulate the old HRE’s order. With honored holymen rising to become the new Bishops to rule over the newly-created Dioceses and Bishoprics, favored merchants and captains of industry becoming the new Fee City electors, and with generals and nobles of Belgian, German, and even native backgrounds being made into the new Prince-Electors, each getting their own territory to lord over as their personal fiefdoms. This atmosphere of neo-feudalism mixed with pious adherence to Catholicism, a reforged colonial economic system based on rampant mercantilism, and a resurging martial emphasis,  has coalesced into one of the most bizarre and unique political entities on the planet. As if he had just taken pages from history and applied them to a modern setting, Erzkanzler von Epp has created an insane fusion of European tradition and elective monarchism with imperialist policy and colonial economics. Now, with the foundations of this new empire set, all that remains now is to crown our first monarch, who shall reign as the First King of the Africans and the first Emperor of the Heiliges Afrikanisches Reich.."

Once a bustling center of trade and culture during the reign of the Yeke Kingdom, Bunkeya has long since stagnated in its fall from prosperity. The rule of the joint Flandro-Wallonian-German mission has cast a dark cloud over the colony. Though these Europeans brought the light of civilization, with all of its accompanying technologies and accouterments, they have also brought death and decay. The colony and its native people are overworked by its overseers who use the natives as cheap labor, harvesting the vast natural and mineral riches of the Congo. Though this system has created vast amounts of material wealth for the Flandro-Wallonians, and for Mitteleuropa as a whole, it has also drawn the ire of many natives in the colony. Most prominent among the dissidents of the colonial regime is the Mwami and his loyal followers. The Mwami is the local, rightful ruler to these lands in the eyes of the natives, and his insurrectionary activities continue to be a thorn in the side of our administration and threaten the very stability of our stake here. Before it is too late, a direction must be chosen if the colony is to survive. Whether we crush the Mwami or decide to tolerate their existence, we must be certain it is the correct path. Despite the growing dark clouds on the horizon, both here in the colony and back home on the European mainland, our colonial government must steer itself on a direct and measured course if it is to survive the coming storm."

These rebels claim the current administration has kowtowed to the whims of natives and non-important groups for too long, restraining the colonial dream and its basal goals. The UMHK have seized parts of Elisabethville as well as their mining and harvesting operations across the colony and refuse to deescalate the situation while the FP have seized control of the capital and the rest of Bas-Congo, taking the vital port of Matadi with them. \n\nIn response, our cabinet has come up with two possible solutions to our problems. The first option is to simply do nothing and let these rebels continue their operations in peace, with proponents for this plan claiming tensions will cool in the coming weeks and that direct military action would be too hasty or drastic, for these are our colonial brothers, and to fire on them would be madness. Alternatively, the main opposition to this plan is to ride out and crush this insurrection now before it can grow out of hand.

However, Ryckmans has long stood as a stalwart defender of Congolese interests over favoring either Berlin or Brussels, and if he were to be voted out, the Vrijstaat would likely greatly swing towards one of these two benefactors for aid and legitimacy. \n\nTo replace Ryckmans stands two main alternatives, each pursuing their own agendas. Fighting for increased German interests and control in the Congo is the famed Franz Ritter von Epp, hero of the Weltkrieg and Knight of the German Empire. Under his rule, the Vrijstaat would work towards closer cooperation and even possible full integration into the wider Mittelafrikan patchwork itself, giving the Kaiserreich full access to the Congo’s riches.

The foolish Flandro-Wallonians could not hope to handle this chaos-filled primordial paradise, and as such they have lost their mandate to rule over the Congo to our more able administration. \n\n However, with the Epp regime now thoroughly cemented in their position as the new hegemons of the Congo, a final choice on the future of this Eden must be made. Long has this region been a hotbed for separatism, anti-colonialism, and general unrest between both the various native groups and the colonists themselves. To disrupt this carefully-balanced status quo would be suicide to our new regime, or at least many of our more cautious ministers and generals feel so, and so we coulld heed their warnings and merely continue the rule of the old Congo Colony under a the new moniker of the Kongo Freistaat, reserving our autonomy and nominally still accepting the co-rule of our Flandro-Wallonian allies. Alternatively, the far more fervent loyalists, diehard monarchists, and other dedicated ministers within our camp instead seek to go with an opposite approach. These loyalists instead hope to merge the Congo into the wider Mittelafrikan megacolony, integrating Leopoldville directly with Dar-Es-Salaam, and fully uniting the central expanse of Africa under the Iron Cross of the Kaiserreich. \n\nDistinct from these two options however exists a third camp, championed by von Epp himself, who instead seek a middle-ground option. Seeking to cast-off the shared rule of the Flandro-Wallonians, who have proven all to clearly to be poor colonial leaders and incapable of ruling over the Congo, and to instead create a new, purely Afro-German state at the center of this Dark Continent to serve as the new, Germanized crown jewel of the Kaiser’s African ambitions. Under this plan, von Epp would rise as the new Staathalter of a unified and autonomous Deutscher Zentralafrikanischer Staat, finally freeing the Congo from the shackles of lesser rulers and races, and introducing the full might of German culture and governance to these lands while keeping a separate and distinct identity from wider Mittelafrika.

From overly harsh punishments towards his own soldiers to committing wholesale slaughter of French and African civilians in the swamps of the Congo, Fegelein has committed more acts of cruelty against both colonials and Africans than most, and yet he still remains in his high position. Fegelein, despite his many flaws and deranged pleasures, is admittedly an efficient, if excessively brutal, colonial administrator and quite the effective military commander to boot, and his usefulness tied with the general aloofness of the Mittelafrikan regime has kept him from being court martialed. \n\nFegelein’s most recent exploit to receive widespread attention and ire from his superiors has caused quite the political quagmire. It seems that after a long weekend of drinking local spirits, chewing khat, and smoking opium with his gang of rough riders and savage soldiers, Fegelein and his crew got into a scuffle with some local African tribals. Getting into a confrontation outside a local biergarten, Fegelein and his men began to harass a group of tribals with racial remarks that soon escalated into physical violence. After beating the Africans senseless and making off with some of their valuables, Fegelein’s posse was chased down by both colonial officers and armed Askari. It would seem that the group of Africans they assaulted and mugged were of royal blood, being the kin of a local Baluba paramount chief that has long been loyal to German rule and particularly to von Epp. To give off the facade of accountability, the colonial officials arrested Fegelein and his men, forcing them to give back the various trinkets and cash stolen from these royals. However, the situation has since spiraled into a minor diplomatic crisis between the German administration and the local chiefs, and von Epp is now up to his neck in bureaucratic annoyances and diplomatic posturing, much to his chagrin. As a result, Fegelhein has been temporarily jailed to maintain some goodwill with the Baluba while this blows over, though his ‘cell’ is more like a quaint and spacious apartment. However, a few of his men did not fare so well, and have been offered up to higher sentences and punishments as a scapegoat for Fegelein - a fact hidden from the Baluba delegation. \n\nSoon, this shall all blow over as von Epp diligently and expertly handles the situation, but many wonder how many times Fegelein can escape true punishment for his misdeeds."

Taking on such a lofty position however shall require him to leave the Congo and Kinshasa behind, leaving the position of Governor-General open for one of his potential successors to take the reins of command like Schnee or Goering. Now, our new Governor-General shall lead the Congo along this path of Germanization that von Epp started while the old veteran himself takes his new seat atop the hierarchy of Germany’s African possessions."

conbel.24.d:0 "With Mittelafrika collapsing into complete and utter chaos, Franz Ritter von Epp heroically trekked back to Leopoldville and assumed command of the local administration that still survived the initial waves of the collapse. Now thoroughly in charge of the Congo, von Epp must make a choice on where to take this reacquired jewel of Afrika. Sure, von Epp has sworn a lifelong duty to the Kaiser and the German Empire, but the failings of this now-dying empire are as clear as day, and have left von Epp shaken, with his loyalties falling into question. Before this catastrophe, it would have been no choice or even thought for von Epp to immediately send communications to Berlin, reaffirming his loyalty to the Crown and notifying the Kaiser that the Congo was once again thoroughly in German hands, and this is still a choice that lies before the infamous ‘Kaiser’s Hand.’ If he were to bend the knee to Berlin once more, he could choose to accept reality and merely reinforce the Congo, or even go on some grand crusade to reconquer the lands of Mittelafrika and restore the old colonial order. Such decisions would earn him great honors and rewards from the Kaiser and his countrymen, but such a victory pales in comparison to the glories that await von Epp should he turn his back on this decaying imperialist power and instead blaze a new path forth atop his own ambitions. Denying the faltering light of the Kaiser, von Epp could stride forth and retake the lands of Mittelafrika for himself and for his loyal allies and fellow colonials who have proven themselves in Afrika - the world’s last great frontier! The choice is up to von Epp of course, but what shall he choose - to rekindle a dying empire, to accept the grim reality of post-Collapse Afrika, or deny both these paths to chase his destiny and former Germanic glories for the good of all Germans left on the Dark Continent?"

conbel.25.d:0 "As Mittelafrika burned in the chaos of the Collapse, Staathalter Franz Ritter von Epp began a perilous journey from the war-torn city of Dar-Es-Salaam, which had become overrun with Goering loyalists, rival Askari, and warring native groups, to his favored city of Leopoldville, hundreds of miles away on the other side of the continent. Though the trek was long and fraught with danger, with numerous guerilla forces assaulting von Epp’s convoy along the way, von Epp finally arrived in Leopoldville, where he was greeted with a city consumed in inferno and racial violence as the remaining colonials, both Belgian and German, fought back against the rising Congolese tide. With von Epp and his veterans joining the fray, the Europeans were able to turn the tide and cleanse the city of separatists, securing von Epp’s hold over the city. Now, with his rule consolidated, von Epp has begun to send patrols and squads into the jungles to slowly take back his new domain. Though the local Flandro-Wallonians may not be fully happy under the yoke of the Germans once more, their united front is their only hope at survival."

Sengier and his UMHK, along with the remaining forces of the Force Publique and any other remaining Belgian colonial not already in the German camp, have pushed back on von Epp’s attempts at complete dominance. Stating that the Collapse is no cause for a complete reshuffling of the colonial hierarchy, the Flandro-Wallonian colonials argue that such a mass shift would only cause more chaos and degradation to the fragile imperialist remnant. Despite von Epp’s ambitions, he will have to begrudgingly work with the Flandro-Wallonians, at least for now."

conbel.27.d:0 "With the consolidation of von Epp’s regime in the Congo, our great and honorable leader has declared his intention to name the new Prince-Electors of the Congo, creating a new Electoral College to eventually vote on a new Emperor for our growing empire. With many loyalists and allies, both old and new, clamoring for a position, von Epp has had to make hard decisions and shrewd checks of loyalty, for not only does each Elector get a vote, but also a piece of the Congo now, and if their plan is successful a piece of Mittelafrika later. \n\nAfter a long and thorough period of contemplation, von Epp named his initial list of Prince-Electors, though more would eventually need to be named if their reconquest of Africa proved successful. \n\nDrawing from all corners of the Congolese political atmosphere, von Epp has assembled a colorful and diverse cast of loyalists to his cause. From the remnants of the NKR, the likes of Hermann Fegelein, Kai-Uwe von Hassel, Josef Terboven, and many others have been made new Princes, as have local native allies such as Alexander Duala Manga Bell, Moïse Tshombe, Daniel Kanza, and the Mwami of Katanga, along with many other loyal Askari generals and Paramount Chiefs. Not stopping there, von Epp also named a few Force Publique veterans such as Armand Huyghé and Émille Janssens. Not stopping with his homage to the Holy Roman Empire there, von Epp has also announced that certain cities like Elisabethville and Matadi would become Free Cities, led by prominent economic figures in the Congo like Edgar Sengier and Jules Cousins. Taking it further, new Catholic Bishoprics and Diocese have been erected by favored priests and holy figures, as well as the likes of devout colonial missionaries such as Diedrich Hermann Westermann. These new members of the Imperial Electoral College of Africa shall aid Franz Ritter von Epp in his goals to bring civilization and Catholicism to the great and varied peoples of Africa, serving as a beacon of stability and modernity. More importantly, these honored souls will soon cast their vote to decide the first Emperor of our new Congo-borne African empire."

conbel.28.t:0 "Electing our New Holy African Emperor"
conbel.28.d:0 "With the Prince-Electors gathered in Leopoldville and the foundations of our new administration set, Chief Elector Franz Ritter von Epp has called for a new imperial diet to be held so that the first emperor of our new Reich can be chosen. Before this newly-assembled council lay the names of many men who this group may crown, but only one can be emperor, and much debate and thought must go into this decision. Once elected, our new emperor shall become the public facade of our nation - a beacon of stability, tradition, and piety - as von Epp still continues to truly run the nation and its military from the shadows. \n\nWith preparations finished, the chambers to the new imperial senate, built on the grounds of the old colonial office in Leopoldville, buzzed to life with anxiety and expectation as the long and arduous voting process began. Though many, many names have been put forward by the various ex-colonials, paramount chiefs, Bishops, NKR loyalists, and other allies of von Epp, only a few stand any real shot at winning. The most obvious choice to many, and to von Epp himself, is to elect the honorable Crown Prince of Bavaria Rupprecht, whose experience already as a monarch and as a friend of von Epp make him the perfect candidate. In opposition to this, a small group of Belgian ex-colonials and remnants from the Force Publique and UMHK have instead floated the name of the young Prince Badouin, the infantile son of Leopold III, son of Albert, of Flanders-Wallonia, who would likely prove to be easy to control due to his young age and inexperience. \n\nWith these royals already accounted for, that leaves the less likely but still prominent candidates in the running. The various native interest groups and paramount chiefs-turned-electors seek to crown devoted Kamerunian monarchist and German loyalist Alexander Duala Manga Bell while von Epp’s loyalists in the NKR have begun to float names like Hermann Fegelein, von Epp’s right-hand man, as a possible candidate. Meanwhile, some have even been calling for von Epp to simply be crowned himself, for only he has proven his skill and gaul as he moves to retake all of German Africa. \n\nThough who sits on the throne shall matter for little aside from public image and legitimacy, this election is still monumentally important, for it shall dictate who will become the face of our new Holy African Empire. With our new emperor on the throne and von Epp at the helm of the state and the military, our ambitions here will not merely die in the Congo’s jungles and swamps, for whoever sits on that throne shall be the beacon that illuminates the way to our destiny!"

All around, this primeval Eden still burns, and chaos still reigns. Be it viruses running rampant, poverty stricken families fleeing to the cities in hopes of finding scraps, or the various wildfires lit during fighting still burning, the nation is nowhere close to truly being free of conflict. Even during this chaos, it seems our people are not without aid. Be it the International Red Cross, the Salvation Army or any number of other charity groups, Christian or otherwise, have all converged on the Congo following the civil war to aid in reconstruction. While their aid cannot hope to steam the tide by itself, the very presence of these groups gives hope to our people. Hope, that in the future, the Congo will be rebuild, hope that the chaos will end, hope that normality will prevail."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_PIERRE_RYCKMANS_DESC:0 "The Highborn Lord Pierre, 1st Graff Ryckmans, has served the Flandro-Wallonian government for most of his life, as has his family before him for generations back home in Flanders. Born in 1891, Ryckmans comes from a family of esteemed lawyers and politicians, with his father Alphonse serving as a prominent senator in the Flandro-Wallonian Senate as a member of the Catholic Party. His father’s views deeply impacted Ryckmans from a young age, going on to study philosophy at the Catholic University of Leuven before hopping around schools between Germany, Ireland, and Flanders-Wallonia before the horrors of the Weltkrieg began, inspiring him to voluntarily enlist. Originally assigned to the Yser Front, Ryckmans long held an idealized admiration for the Dark Continent and applied to transfer to the colonies for overseas service as soon as he was able. It was here on the battlefields of Africa that Ryckmans made a name for himself as a sound tactician and leader as he fought back against both European soldiers and Mwami warriors, paving the way for his future colonial career post-war. After briefly returning home to finish his law degree and to write and publish the first of his literary works and memoirs, Ryckmans returned to the Congo and was soon elected to become the mayor of Herminestadt - one of the Congo’s largest cities and the main administrative center in the colony. Now, having proven his effectiveness and worth, Pierre Ryckmans serves as Governor-General of the Congo Vrijstaat. Under his leadership, colonial rule shall be maintained at all costs as Ryckmans attempts to drag the ailing Vrijstaat into the modern era."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_CONGO_DESC:0 "Albert I is known by many monikers: Le Roi-Chevalier, Der Koning-Soldaat, Heir to Leopold, and the Exiled King of the Flandro-Wallonians. These titles and honorifics have been bequeathed to him by his people’s adoration, his Godsent birthright, and his valorant acts in the Weltkrieg; and yet this noble ‘Soldier King’ has languished in exile while a German pretender sits on his throne. With the collapse of the previous colonial order under the ‘stewardship’ of the Kaiser’s forces, the Congo Vrijstaat has once again fully returned to the hands of its rightful Flandro-Wallonian masters, free from German meddling for the first time in decades. With this return of the proven pre-Weltkrieg status-quo, the Frandro-Wallonian loyalists within the Vrijstaat made overtures to their exiled king, who has long lived in Canada with the bulk of the Entente exiles, welcoming the Knight King Albert I back to the lands of Leopold’s free state and the center of the once mighty Flandro-Wallonian colonial empire. Though still far from Brussels and his throne, Albert I, rightful King of the Flandro-Wallonians, shall use the Congo as his new staging ground as he and his forces gather their strength to finally overthrow the vile German-backed regime that has stolen his homeland and his birthright from him. The mistakes of the Weltkrieg will be undone as Albert readies to fight for his people and his nation against the wicked Hun for the second time in his honored life."
POLITICS_VON_EPP_DESC:0 "With a career forged in war and colonial conquest, few men are more fit to lead one of the Kaiser’s glorious Afrikan colonies than Franz Ritter von Epp. A Bavarian man through and through, Epp was born in Munich in 1868 to famous realist painter Rudolf Epp, but quickly departed from his father’s artistic pursuits and joined the Munich Military Academy after graduating from school, beginning his storied military career. First seeing life action during the Boxer Rebellion, he would later see multiple deployments across Africa and Asia, most notable of which was his role in the vicious war against the Herero and Namaqua peoples of Südwestafrika. After this long term of colonial service, Epp was drafted into the fires of the Weltkrieg, seeing action in Serbia, Romania, Italy, and France, displaying such valourous and heroic acts that he was knighted by the Kaiser himself following the end of the war. Since then, von Epp has received higher and higher positions throughout His Majesty’s empire, and has now found himself as Staathalter of all of Mittelafrika. Under his rule, German interests shall be paramount above all else as Dar-Es-Salaam draws closer to Berlin."
POLITICS_VON_EPP_CONGO_DESC:0 "With a career forged in war and colonial conquest, few men are more fit to lead one of the Kaiser’s glorious Afrikan colonies than Franz Ritter von Epp. A Bavarian man through and through, Epp was born in Munich in 1868 to famous realist painter Rudolf Epp, but quickly departed from his father’s artistic pursuits and joined the Munich Military Academy after graduating from school, beginning his storied military career.

Since then, von Epp has received higher and higher positions throughout His Majesty’s empire, and has now found himself leading the colonial administration of the Congo. Under his rule German interests shall be paramount above all else as Leopoldville draws closer to Berlin."
POLITICS_LEO_PETILLON_DESC:0 "Léon ‘Léo’ Pétillon is a career civil-servant and once-staunch ally of Pierre Ryckmans, but following his predecessor’s fall from grace, Pétillon has risen to become the new Governor-General of the Congo. Born in 1903 in Esneux, Léo spent his youth slowly training to become a lawyer before joining the Ministry of the Colonies for colonial service in 1929. Since then, Pétillon steadily rose through the ranks of the colonial hierarchy due to his ties to chief ministers in the Flandro-Wallonian parliament and his sharp aptitude for colonial governance. With the fall of the previous cabinet, Pétillon was chosen as the natural successor to Ryckmans’ failed attempt at pseudo-military rule under the Force Publique, and with his technocratic beliefs established during his time as a lawyer and his staunch adherence to Catholicism well-known, the new Governor-General has been seen by many as the humanizing face the Vrijstaat has long sorely needed. Now, the people of the Congo watch Pétillon like a hawk, hoping to see if he is the blessing he truly seems to be."

### Focuses ###
COG_Colonial_Rule:0 "Fight the Mwami's Influence"
COG_Colonial_Rule_desc:0 "The Mwami has been defeated and Colonial Rule has been established. Tensions are high however between the Flemish-Wallonians and the native Congolese population who urge for the abolition of European patronalisation."
COG_Dominer_Pour_Servir:0 "Dominer pour Servir"
COG_Dominer_Pour_Servir_desc:0 "'Rule so we can Serve'. These simple words define the colonial policy that the old Belgian government decreed in the Congo. The Congolese are our children and we have to raise and lift them so they too can enjoy the virtues of Western Progress. This is a slow proces and while it hopes to reward the Congolese in the end, colonial rule isn't supposed to disappear for many more years."
COG_Restoration_Missions:0 "Restoration of the Missions"
COG_Restoration_Missions_desc:0 "Due to aggressive German policies against the power of the catholic church, many of our mission posts have been abandoned. Now that we are back in control, our catholic associates are urging us to request new missionaries from Flanders-Wallonia so we can further develop our 'Dominer pour Servir' program."
COG_Continue_Mission_To_Civilise:0 "Continue the Mission to Civilise"
COG_Continue_Mission_To_Civilise_desc:0 "It is our task to civilise the Dark Continent and while the German regime has helped them stray from the light of God, the time has returned to continue our task and bring Africa (slowly) into the future."
COG_Reward_The_Evolues:0 "Reward the Evolués"
COG_Reward_The_Evolues_desc:0 "It has become clear that we Europeans are not going to remain in Africa forever. Therefore we have to prepare the African population for their approaching independence. By educating and promoting the Evolués, we can secure that a transfer of power can be executed both peacefully and without economic depression."
COG_Elections_Herminestadt:0 "Allow Free Elections in the Congo"
COG_Elections_Herminestadt_desc:0 "The only way to consolidate power and satisfy our German overlords is to allow for free and fair elections within the colony. If we are truly a continuation of the Belgian state in Africa, we must appease our white middle class by letting them participate in local democracy."
COG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap:0 "Abolish the Invisible Colour Gap"
COG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap_desc:0 "While unlike the British or French colonies there never was a distinct colour gap in Congo, a glass ceiling blocked the Congolese from reaching high administrative or political positions. To combat the unrest that this has caused, the new progressive government has started efforts to break through these traditions and has started training the Evolués to replace some of the strictly European posts."
COG_Union_Miniere_Haut_Katanga:0 "Overhaul Union Minière de Haut-Katanga"
COG_Union_Miniere_Haut_Katanga_desc:0 "Not only is the UMHK the largest employer in our country, nearly all of economy relies on this company. Te secure a steady stream of income to the state, the UMHK is to be further integrated in the state and expanded upon."
COG_Expand_Ruashi_Mine:0 "Expand the Ruashi Mines"
COG_Expand_Ruashi_Mine_desc:0 "Due to the increasing importance of Copper in Europe, our mining operations have been expanding to meet demands. The Ruashi mine, which opened in 1911, has been one of our main copper and cobalt mines in the Congo and is in dire need of further expansion. To further guarantee prosperity for our own people, the government has also decided to expand the nearby refining industry and a such provide jobs."
COG_Limit_Native_Careers:0 "Limit Native Careers"
COG_Limit_Native_Careers_desc:0 "Unlike many of the other colonial powers, the UMHK allowed natives to operate the heavy machinery and held large training programs to successfully educate the workforce. A Katangese worker could climb up to become a machine operator or a clerk but was then limited by the Belgian leadership to avoid losing control over the organisation."
COG_Educate_Native_Engineers:0 "Educate Native Engineers"
COG_Educate_Native_Engineers_desc:0 "German reforms in the last decades have greatly changed the consciousness of the Katangese population. They now demand equal jobs and equal pay as European workers and are strengthened in their demands by the new government. Therefore the UMHK is opening up engineering positions to all of our citizens and created a schooling program with professors from the universities of Liège and Gent."
COG_Increase_Cobal_Production:0 "Increase the Cobalt Production"
COG_Increase_Cobal_Production_desc:0 "With rising arms production around the world and the great importance of Cobalt for modern technology, the UMHK has decided to open three more mines around the city of Herminestadt to meet these demands and to further propel ourselves to become the prime exporter of this rare earth material."
COG_Apoint_District_Overseers:0 "Appoint District Overseers"
COG_Apoint_District_Overseers_desc:0 "Due to the collapse of the German regime, many of our administrative structures and personnel have been dissolved or killed. As our economy relies quite heavily on the local chiefs and their influence, we need trained personnel to communicate with and oversee these Chefs and make them fall in line."
COG_Resinstate_The_Chefferies:0 "Reinstate the Chefferies"
COG_Resinstate_The_Chefferies_desc:0 "The system of Chefferies consisted of a rigid network of Colonial personnel and local chiefs. Once every few weeks, one of our district officials was to visit all the villages in his district and collect the gathered resources and speak law in name of the central government."
COG_Install_Farming_Quotas:0 "Install Farming Quotas"
COG_Install_Farming_Quotas_desc:0 "To feed the growing urban populations of Bunkeya and Herminestadt, we have to impose strict farming quotas on the chefferies. These will then be collected by personnel of the colonial government in exchange for money and commodities and transfered to the cities."
COG_Centre_Extra_Coutumiers:0 "Centre Extra-Coutumiers"
COG_Centre_Extra_Coutumiers_desc:0 "While the system of Chefferies worked well in the past, the growing population and the questionable loyalty of the cheffs has pushed the government to create their own economic centres on the countryside. These will take over the task of the chefferies and will be the centre for legal, economic and social gathering."
COG_Monopolise_Agricultural_Companies:0 "Monopolise Agricultural Companies"
COG_Monopolise_Agricultural_Companies_desc:0 "Currently our agricultural industry constitutes of farming quotas implaced on the villages and the collection of these whenever the district manager passes by the village. This has proven an unreliable system and doesn't have the efficiency and output of modern farming. Therefore the government has approved the creation of a state company like the UMHK to control this industry."
COG_Increase_Taxation:0 "Increase Taxation"
COG_Increase_Taxation_desc:0 "The Depression of Black Monday still looms over the Congo and requests both from within the nation and Flanders-Wallonia itself have asked for a temporary increased level of taxation to help the recovering economy."
COG_Modernize_Bunkeya:0 "Modernise Bunkeya"
COG_Modernize_Bunkeya_desc:0 "While Bunkeya is our capital, the city of Herminestadt is the true heart of the Congo. To increase the importance of Bunkeya and with the approval of the Mwami, the colonial government has started large scale construction projects in the city to bring it to the 20th century and permit easies development of the surrounding lands."
COG_Technical_University_Herminestadt:0 "Technical University of Herminestadt"
COG_Technical_University_Herminestadt_desc:0 "Due to the large growth of the UMHK over the last years, they have offered the government a large amount of funds to help in the creation of a technical university in Herminestadt. Requests for teachers and further funding have been sent to Flanders-Wallonia and have been met with large approval of the Flemish-Wallonian population sending their expertise and capital to develop the Congo."
COG_Connect_Bunkeya_Herminestadt:0 "Electrify Bunkeya-Herminestadt"
COG_Connect_Bunkeya_Herminestadt_desc:0 "Our two main cities are disconnected from each other making communication and transport very difficult. Therefore the railway Bunkeya-Herminestadt is to be expanded enabling larger amounts of both goods and people to use the line."
COG_The_Colonial_Trinity:0 "The Colonial Trinity"
COG_The_Colonial_Trinity_desc:0 "All power in the colony lies with the three Pillars of modern society: Church, Capital and Order. The Church provides spiritual and basic education, Capital offers them job opportunities, creates commodities and sustains their everyday needs while Order keeps those that step out of line from spreading their message."
COG_Patronisation_of_the_Natives:0 "Patronisation of the Natives"
COG_Patronisation_of_the_Natives_desc:0 "The Congolese citizen is less developed than his European counterpart and needs careful assistance to guide them on his path. Media and newspapers have to be censored to make them model citizens and government functions are best kept away from them until they have earned their civilisation certificate."
COG_Control_All_Aspects_of_Modern_Life:0 "Control all Aspects of Modern Life"
COG_Control_All_Aspects_of_Modern_Life_desc:0 "The UMHK controls all aspects of its workers lives. They work in its mines, eat in its cantinas, buy their groceries in its stores. Housing is provided to all workers as well as support for the wife and children of the miner. While this has provided a life of certain welfare to the miners, a sudden crisis in the company not only removes their jobs but their whole lives."
COG_Embrace_Congolese_Belgian_Culture:0 "Congolese-Belgian Melting Pot"
COG_Embrace_Congolese_Belgian_Culture_desc:0 "Herminestadt has grown to become a hub for both Flemish-Wallonians and Katangese who all live next to each other. The old European quarter and the cité indigène have been dismantled and have paved the way for large avenues and a larger feeling of cohesion between the natives and the colonials."
COG_Improve_Native_Living_Standards:0 "Improve Native Living Standards"
COG_Improve_Native_Living_Standards_desc:0 "With jobs and pay equal for both natives and colonials, the overall welfare of the population has risen. Due to the blooming copper mining buisness and new mining techniques from universities all across Mittel-Europa, working conditions have also improved dramatically paving the way for the 8-hour workday."
COG_Equals_For_The_Law:0 "Equals for the Law"
COG_Equals_For_The_Law_desc:0 "No longer shall a Congolese citizen be punished harder for the same crime as his colonial counterpart. With the introduction of a completely new legal system, borrowing heavily from the Flemish-Wallonian, the rights of all men are guaranteed."

COG_Stability_Force_Publique_desc:0 "Due to the chaos that ensued in the wake of the Mwamis rebellion, the Flemish-Wallonians in Herminestadt quickly reformed the Force Publique out of the ashes of German askaris to resist his attack. While we successfully repulsed their assault, the FP is only a shadow of its former self."
COG_A_European_Army:0 "A European Army"

COG_An_African_Army_desc:0 "The end of Colonialism is approaching and we need to secure a well-trained corps bolstered with local officers to make sure the nation doesn't fall into disarray after our departure."
COG_Heavy_Equipement:0 "Heavy Equipement"
COG_Heavy_Equipement_desc:0 "To assist in the defence of our cities and the attack of foreign strongholds, we need artillery to support our advancing troops."
COG_Arsenal_Herminestadt:0 "Build the Arsenal of Herminestadt"

COG_Restoration_Force_Publique:0 "Restoration of the Force Publique"
COG_Restoration_Force_Publique_desc:0 "In spite of their controversial history, the Force Publique has once again proved vital in maintaining order against the chaos of Africa. By restoring the structure of European officers we can ensure that the new Force Publique retains the respect and ability of its Belgian predecessors."
COG_Learn_From_East_Africa_Offensive:0 "Learn from the East-Afrika Offensive"
COG_Learn_From_East_Africa_Offensive_desc:0 "While the initial campaigns of the FP proved successful against the German forces, the collapse of the British and the subsequent failure of the Western Front forced us in disbanding the corps. Now that the corps is reinstated, it's time to learn from our failures and adapt."
COG_Secure_Our_Investements:0 "Secure our Investments"
COG_Secure_Our_Investements_desc:0 "We may have lost the Congo but we will not let African war chiefs undo all of our hard labour. If they cannot guarantee a free market, we will persuade them on the field."

COG_Access_To_The_Sea:0 "Access to the Sea"
COG_Access_To_The_Sea_desc:0 "Our economy is primarily based around the sale and export of the various resources and materials extracted from the rich Congo. For this to continue, sea access is vital, but yet there is an obstacle to this goal - there is but one large seaport in all of the Congo. Unfortunately, recent developments in Leopoldville have left our main port at Matadi non operational. We must find a way to export our goods or else our fragile economy could slip further into collapse."

COG_Luanda_Port:0 "Economic Support from Portugal"
COG_Luanda_Port_desc:0 "A solution to our financial problems lies in opening up to powers outside of Mittelafrika, especially Portugal, which is an undeniable maritime trading power that is also close to us territorially thanks to the colony of Angola to the south. With their economic support we can develop our economic assets and solve our financial crisis while being less dependent on the Germans, which some of the more pro-German members of our administration criticize."
COG_Trade_Mission_Portugal:0 "Send a Trade Mission to Portugal"
COG_Trade_Mission_Portugal_desc:0 "With the influence of the Kaiserreich ever continuing to waver and wane here on the Dark Continent, the appeal of German business ties has diminished. Unlike Germany, Portugal still largely remains in control of its African holdings to our east and west. Their support and economic assistance is essential to maintaining our independence, and so a trade delegation shall be sent to Lisbon to discuss a possible deal."
COG_Pink_Map_Negotiations:0 "Pink Map Negotiations"
COG_Pink_Map_Negotiations_desc:0 "With the evermore chaotic world situation developing as it has, Portugal has begun to pursue its old colonial claim to our region.

COG_POR_Submission:0 "O Congo é Nosso"
COG_POR_Submission_desc:0 "Despite protests from anti-imperialist elements within the nation, our regime has decided to work with the Portuguese. We have accepted Portuguese protection in exchange for broad autonomy and economic assistance. Let us reap the benefits of this controversial agreement and put our new funds to good use to build up the Congo with the help of our new benefactors, the Congo is now theirs as much as it is ours."
COG_Herminestadt_Luanda_Railroad:0 "Expand the Herminestadt-Luanda Railway"
COG_Herminestadt_Luanda_Railroad_desc:0 "Herminestadt and Portuguese Angola are separated by a mere few hundred miles of relatively clear and flat terrain - a practical stone’s throw away on this massive continent, and yet no rail connections exist. With our ample manpower reserves fueling our labour force and Portuguese financial backing funding the project, we shall have a rail line at last that connects Angola and Congo like never before, de-isolating our primordial paradise just a little more."

COG_Support_Kongo:0 "Support the Manikong"
COG_Support_Kongo_desc:0 "Kitanga has always been at least nominally part of the colony of the Congo. This presents both advantages and disadvantages - on one hand, we retain connections to the elite of Kinshasa where the new Kongolese regime is based, on the other, that gives them a basis on which to assert control over us. We must come to an agreement with the Manikong to stop this."
COG_Send_Division_Manikongo:0 "Arm the Tribes"
COG_Send_Division_Manikongo_desc:0 "It is in our best interest to ensure that the regime in Kinshasa survives its present conflict. While we possess few arms, we should send what we can spare to them."
COG_Boma_Port:0 "The Port of Boma"
COG_Boma_Port_desc:0 "Infrastructure is already in place to carry goods from the Congo, the river port city of Boma. We should approach the Mamikong about reopening these old routes on a permanent basis."
COG_Join_Kongolese_War:0 "Join in the Kongolese Civil War"
COG_Join_Kongolese_War_desc:0 "As Kinshasa and Kivu fight, they both grow weaker. We can now strong arm our old allies in Kinshasa for recognition in exchange for support in their current conflict."

COG_German_Connections:0 "Rekindle Connections with the Kaiserreich"
COG_German_Connections_desc:0 "German rule was beneficial for the Mwami and the the Congon ruling class. We should continue to work closely with them."
COG_Daressalam_Port:0 "German Bailout"
COG_Daressalam_Port_desc:0 "In order to develop our falling economy and meet the needs created by our fragile financial situation, we should ask our German friends for a bailout, some criticize that this will make us more dependent on the Germans, but it is the simplest and most effective solution to our problems."
COG_Katanga_Tangyanika_Railroads:0 "Construct the Congo-Tanganyika Railway"
COG_Katanga_Tangyanika_Railroads_desc:0 "After our previous decision to ask for a bailout from the Germans, it is quite necessary that we continue our economic development alongside them. For this purpose it was decided by our administration and the central government of Mittelafrika to build a new railroad connecting Lubumbashi and Dar-Es-Salaam.  Such a project would have cost us a considerable amount of money, but the Germans have offered a generous financial support to this project which is mutually beneficial to us."

Self-sufficiency, local cooperation with other African states, and constructing our own native industry shall be key goals for our new economy.  What few funds we have should be directed, in partnership with our allies, towards the exploitation of the natural bounty of this land, for our own profit.

Though he started the Congo’s modernization and civilizing processes, turning the Congo into a profitable venture for rubber production, ivory sourcing, and mining, he did so through committing brutal acts against the native Congolese. Though harsh, Leopold II’s rule showed that in the Congo, profitable results required sacrifice, and so we will replicate his methods in a more modern and less barbaric way in order to further his civilizing mission here in the Congo."

From gold and silver to iron and uranium deposits to rubber tree forests that stretch for acres and underground deposits of oil and natural gas, the Congo is one of the most bountiful paradises on this planet - a true Eden on Earth. To ensure these resources are efficiently extracted and processed, the UMHK and other resource conglomerates in the Congo shall coalesce together into a central economic planning board, becoming an official arm of the state as the chief economic bureaucracy of the Congo.

Once again, we must rely on this colony's immense population to fuel the coming war effort and fill out our divisions. We must conscript the natives to work both in the factories and to hold a gun on the frontline, for without their manpower, our crusade to retake Brussels is doomed to fail.

Since then rubber plantations have grown to stretch across much of our colonies once-stocked and healthy rubber forests. Primarily in Bas-Congo, these plantations already stretch for hundreds of acres, producing liquid cash with each bucket of sap collected.

COG_German_Influence_desc:0 "With their victory in the Weltkrieg, Flanders-Wallonia and the Congo were forced to swear subservience to the new world hegemon. Though the Flandro-Wallonian administration in the Congo was allowed to stay and the reign of the Vrijstaat allowed to continue, the Kaiserreich quickly began to sink its greedy teeth into this resource-rich primordial oasis. With each passing moment, the German Empire further digs its claws into the Congo ever deeper, furthering their influence and fulfilling their own ambitions at the cost of the long-standing Flandro-Wallonian dominance that has existed since Leopold’s regime. Despite their best efforts, however, the influence of these Flandro-Wallonian imperialists and settlers is waning fast. \n\nThis atmosphere of crumbling chaos has come to minorly benefit the Congo, supplying the Force Publique with weapons and the colonial administration with economic aid, but has also greatly destabilized the colony and the very foundations of Flandro-Wallonian rule while also greatly inflaming native tensions who continue to riot and strike against colonial rule. An end to this struggle for dominance must be reached if the Vrijstaat is to survive at all."

congo.20.d:0 "Ash plumes filled the pristine Katanga skies as the fires started by the Mwami’s forces spread to consume Kamina’s Southern district. The capital of the local colonial administrative province, Kamina was the local jewel of the Flandro-Wallonian regime, with a burgeoning merchant quarter and a vibrant tapestry and woodworking industry fueled by skilled native workers now employed by the colonials. All of this prosperity has been erased in the wake of the Mwami’s wrath, for he has resolved himself to make himself known in the minds of the imperialists forever as this aging king passes through his twilight years. On the eve of this week’s dawn, Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila commanded his forces to break their usual guerilla tactics to instead rally and march on the Kamina in a show of force. Quickly overwhelming the meager Force Publique garrison defending the city, these savage and bloodthirsty native warriors have begun to entrench deep in the heart of the city and along its Northern reaches as they burn the rest of this colonial hive to the ground. \n\nAs a result, hundreds of loyal colonials have been slaughtered and much of our economic and military assets within the city have been completely destroyed. We must now decide how best to deal with this act of violence, and with Governor-General Ryckmans’ regime barely holding together as in, this surely will be a test for his administration, for should he fail, the higher-ups back in Europe always have a list of possible replacements waiting..."

The German high colonial office has decreed that the Mwami and his meager band of loyalists is too small a threat to require direct aid from Germany, especially in such a dire time as this. With the fallout of Black Monday and rising tensions in Europe, the Kaiserreich is far too busy abroad to deal with us here in Afrika. It seems we are on our own."

Led by Franz Ritter von Epp, Reinhard Heydrich, and other disillusioned veterans within the Mittelafrikan administration and military. Long seeking their own power and sensing our growing position of weakness, von Epp has begun to make political moves within our regime, confirming our long-held suspicions that ‘the Kaiser’s Hand’ seeks power in the Congo for himself. Making their distaste for our rule official, von Epp and the NKR have officially denounced the Ryckmans administration, and have begun to openly and actively campaign both against Ryckmans and for von Epp as the next Governor-General of the Vrijstaat. Whether this posturing will remain empty threats or escalate into an actual political challenge remains to be seen, but with von Epp’s honors and reputation, he is not an opponent we want."

With the Southern reaches of the city completely ablaze, we have sent what few engineers and support staff to fight the blaze to keep it from spreading further into the city as our main detachments of the Force Publique move in around the flanks and the Northern end to begin the siege. \n\nSlaughtering what few Mwami loyalists that were foolish enough not to seek refuge inside the inner-city, the FP consolidated their position and formed a mighty blockade around the rest of the city as they send in their initial recon teams to scout out the internal situation of the Mwami’s forces and to assess the state of Kamina’s defences. Now, it is only a matter of time before the enemy makes their move, or simply surrenders to our clearly superior forces."

With this atmosphere of division and in-fighting, we have been presented the perfect opportunity to strike as chaos consumes their ranks. As the preparations were finalized, Commander of the FP Léo Petillion began ordering our troops all along the Northern border of the city to begin the march as the flanks were covered by our supporting garrisons in the East and West. With this closing pincer, we shall push the Mwami’s forces back into the inferno they caused that still consumes the Southern districts. With their only avenue of escape cut-off and with their troops ready to mutiny and nearly out of supplies, the Mwami’s forces have become a cornered and wounded fox, and now all we need do is deliver the final blow!"

The city still burns, with artillery fire from our assault only adding to the inferno, with the fires now spreading into the city-center and the Eastern district as well. In the areas of the city not ablaze, rubble and the dead litter the streets where clean-up operations are slowly underway, and the smoke and stench from this horrific site can be seen and smelt for miles as the vultures and hyenas come to the city to feast upon the bounty of carrion. \n\nAcross the colony, the Ryckmans Regime has received nothing but backlash and criticism over this calamity, with much of the Vrijstaat blaming the Governor-General for the wanton destruction of a provincial capital and the deaths of hundreds of civilians - both colonials and native Congolese. With this newest disaster only being the latest in a long series of missteps and controversies, anticolonial sentiment is once again on the rise and many have begun to call for Ryckmans to resign and for another, more respected and competent colonial to take the reins of power, while others have even begun to call for native rule. Though Ryckmans is still solidly in command, and those who call for his resignation have little power, he and his administration must shape up and be wary, for the cracks are starting to show."

congo.27.t:0 "A Return to the Status Quo"
congo.27.d:0 "At last, after a long clean-up operation and reconstruction campaign, the city of Kamina has largely been restored, save for large amounts of tribal housing and farmlands that were forever lost in the raging inferno. The dead have been buried, the walls and merchant quarter have been restored, and the garrison forces have been relieved and replaced. Though outrage against the Ryckmans Regime is still raging, it has lessened since the initial conflict, and the relative calm that once existed here has begun to return. However, the Vrijstaat is still a disconnected, unstable, and chaotic colony, and new dangers are always awaiting around the corner..."
congo.27.a:0 "Colonial order is restored...for now."

congo.28.t:0 "The Great Leopoldville Riots"
congo.28.d:0 "With ire and discontent towards the colonial regime only growing with Ryckmans’ recent blunders, the nascent and infantile Congolese nationalist and home-rule movements have begun to skyrocket in popularity, largely driven on by a new generation of young firebrands both sick of the Évolués and their complacency, and with the colonials and their horrific and oppressive rule. With rising figures such as Joseph Kasa-Vubu and Moïse Tshombe championing regionalist ideas in opposition to nationalist unifiers like Daniel Kanza and Jean Bolikango as young radicals like Joseph Kasongo, Cyrille Adoula, and Isaac Kalonji leave their lives steeped in Western education and influence to stoke the fires of Socialist agitation, everywhere within the Congo has seen rising nativist agitation. However, this conflict and unrest is better showcased nowhere else than within the capital of the Vrijstaat - the great and grand African metropolis of Leopoldville. \n\nWith the recent controversies playing their part in furthering the colony-wide unrest, Leopoldville has become the chaotic and churning cauldron that lies at the source of this conflict, ready to bubble over and pour out of the city and into the wider Congo. At dawn this morning, the local Force Publique garrison under Armand Huyghé and Émille Janssens were met with far more than the regular protests and rabble as tens of thousands of angry ‘Kinshasans’ as they call themselves began to march on the colonial capital. Armed with captured colonial equipment and factory tools, this mass of native Congolese swarmed across the city, looting and rioting as they went in a pure and violent expression of anti-colonial sentiment that has been building for years. Notably, one local known as Leonard Mpoyi has made a name for himself by leading a charge into the FP garrisons, stealing weapons and supplies and distributing them to the other protestors. Though the situation has not spiraled out of control just yet, the FP remains every-vigiland, and more troops from outside the capital are being relocated closer to the city to act as support. Though these riots will likely be put down soon and these locals will return to their normal lives, this massive demonstration has shown our administration that the natives of the Congo are getting serious about sovereignty, and that their independence movements have clear leaders now pulling the strings behind the scenes."
congo.28.a:0 "We must stay vigilant!"

congo.29.t:0 "Anti-Ryckmans Sentiment on the Rise"
congo.29.d:0 "Through damage control and careful diplomacy, we have attempted to fix the public-relations nightmare that the ‘Folly at Kamina’ has caused - and it has been a complete and utter failure. Disapproval and outrage against the Ryckmans’ Regime has never been higher, and what was once small and disconnected calls for new leadership or a change in direction have evolved and coalesced into a violent torrent of public outrage calling for Ryckmans’ resignation. Though the colonial administration has so-far pushed back on these calls for a new order in the Vrijstaat, they have still begun to prepare candidates for replacement just in case. Among the various Force Publique veterans, colonial administrators, and Old Guard generals in the running, two names have risen to the top above all others - Léo Petillion, one of the leading figures of the FP and the Hero of Kamina, and Franz Ritter von Epp, leading figure of the NKR and the ‘Kaiser’s Hand’ here in the Congo. Though Ryckmans is still Governor-General and his word is still law, he must watch his back lest his allies stab him in the back and throw him to the wolves as a scapegoat for the colony’s latest missteps."

Through clever use of the Force Publique and by utilising the population of Herminestadt, the colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans was able to hold on to colonial rule. Now, a formal request has been made by his government for support from our country. In the chaos that ensued after Black Monday, most of our citizens living and working in the Congo were able to escape to Herminestadt where the central power of our mining operations is located. Reports from the missions indicate that around 10.000 of our colonials were able to retreat to Herminestadt where they proclaimed Pierre Ryckmans as their colonial governor. While our government isn't able to launch a full scale offensive to liberate our citizens, the colonials have requested that we sent them weapons, ammunition and food supplies so they can hold off the African war chiefs."

The Catholic missions and colonial Old Guard have proposed that Pierre Ryckmans or his valued right-hand man Léon Pétillon take this prestigious position while the overbearing monopoly that is the UMHK has instead urged the voters to choose Edgar Sengier instead. In sharp contrast to both these movements, the new and growing African Workers Party, under the lead of Léonard Mpoyi and Danizel Kanza, has also announced their bid for the position as well and have been seen swaying voters among the cité indigène. Though after this election, [COG.getleader] will still be securely in charge of the Congo, he will have new advisors and allies he must now listen to if the Congo is to stay whole and stable."

congo.71.d:0 "Dominer pour Servir - Dominate to Serve - is the personal doctrine, and notable book, of Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans, as well as one of the mottos of the Flandro-Wallonian colonial regime. These words embody the colonial mission here in the Vrijstaat, for the ultimate loyalty to their nation and their countrymen is to dominate the African continent, or at least the Congo colony, and all those who reside in it. This harsh doctrine is for the good of the Crown and for the good of the colony, for with colonization comes civilization, or so they say. \n\nIn response to the Mwami’s recent occupation of Kamina, the Ryckmans Regime has declared its intent to double-down on their doctrine of domination for profit and patriotism, flying in the face of recent calls for liberalizing measures to appease the rowdy savages. The Trinité Coloniale must be preserved at all costs, and the Ryckmans Regime is intent on doing everything in their power to uphold this mighty imperialist dynasty. Now if any Congolese group truly seeks independence, their only path to it shall be through violence, for it seems the era of White colonial rule is here to stay."

congo.72.d:0 "Word has returned from Garanganze capital of Bunkeya where the Mwami, outraged by our demands while licking his wounds from our last engagement in Kamina, has ripped apart our letter stripping him of his titles - a part of the new ‘Dominer pour Servir’ movement - and has instead given the order to remobilize his tattered and ragged forces. Due to their loss in Kamina earlier this year, his troops are widely undersupplied and lacking in even the most basic of equipment. Meanwhile, the Force Publique, though still widely armed with Weltkrieg-era weapons, has been preparing for this rising tide of unrest with new supplies from requisitioned Europe. It would seem that conflict within the Congo is far from over, and the Force Publique has been ordered to the lands of the Mwami once more to put down this foolish and aging king."
congo.72.a:0 "We march on Bunkeya!"

congo.73.t:0 "The Mwami Has Fled Once Again!"
congo.73.d:0 "Realising that his position in Bunkeya was indefensible, the Mwami has given the order for his forces to retreat to the old fortress at Munema where they will entrench themselves and wait for our forces to arrive, for they know well they cannot hope to beat us in an open fight now that their forces are so overexerted and under-supplied. Meanwhile, the first trucks loaded with our troops have arrived in Bunkeya, and the city has been mostly secured without much bloodshed or pushback. A temporary airstrip has been created to accommodate the incoming Flandro-Wallonian paracommandos while a new plan of action is being formalised by the general staff of the Force Publique under Armand Huyghé and Émille Janssens."

congo.74.t:0 "The Final Assault on Bunkeya"
congo.74.d:0 "Honouring his legacy and the legacy of the Msiri, the Mwami had decided to refuse our last-minute offer to end this bloodshed and had chosen to die fighting the colonials like his ancestor Msiri did during the Stairs Expedition. In response to this decision and our forces growing anger over the loss of their fellow comrades in the Force Publique, General Émille Janssens had given the order to bomb the Munema fortress with planes and artillery before following up with a combined push by Flandro-Wallonian paracommandos and Force Publique foot soldiers. \n\nThe ancient fortress surely was not at all capable of resisting this type of modern, combined warfare and was first expected to fall within hours. However, in our foolish overconfidence, we had ordered our forces to wait to advance for the moment our bombs stopped falling on the old fortress, and in this brief window, the Mwami and a small detachment of his vanguard and closest advisors were able to slip away in old tunnels beneath the surface. The Mwami’s forces are routed, but his slippery chief has escaped our grasp once more, enraging the FP leadership. Regardless, his movement is too fractured to be any threat now, or so we hope."

Accompanied by loud music and even a performance of the Force Publique orchestra, the stadium has started to fill up with more than 50.000 Katangese already inside and more than 20.000 waiting outside. With a burning sun shining on the supporters, the match began with a goal from Mokuna against the Flemish-Wallonian keeper. The Beerschot attackers were able to turn the tide around at the 42 minute mark scoring two goals against the failing Herminestadt defence, placing the score 2-1 at half-time. During the second half, three more attacks by Beerschot were blocked by the Herminestadt defence and Mokuna was able to score another goal at the 76 minute placing the final score at 2-2.

She countered that due to the reforms pushed by UMHK after the Black Monday scandal, many of the workers can't afford their life necessities anymore and that she resulted in stealing to sustain her family.

Insisting that they are naturally protected against low oxygen environments due to their mountainous home and don't need the 'Chambres à Vapeur' to acclimate to the situation down below, many of these men have died from loss of oxygen or malaria and secretly buried away from the general public. Now the study has leaked out to the population of Herminestadt resulting in a massive strike against the UMHK until better working conditions can be guaranteed.

Due to the expansion of the corporation over the years however this combination is no longer viable for the entire firm leading to loopholes and unjustified punitive measures against the wrong miner. After the economic crisis of 1936, many of the miners are now completely at the mercy of the company, depending on them for food, social facilities, accomodation. To cut back their losses, the UMHK decided to cut back spending for these facilities, causing a general decline in the welfare of the Katangese and increasing calls for better loans and houses now that the economy is back in upswing."

In Herminestadt, the situation is escalating with multiple shops and cafes run by colonials getting thrashed and a general strike in the UMHK. The colonial government is debating whether to take this opportunity to finally complete the nationalisation of the UMHK, forcing the company to directly change its policy and offer better working conditions to the native workforce."

When Léonard Mpoyi and his colleagues however started presenting their evidence to the gathered council, Amour Maron shot the man next to Mpoyi point blank and ordered the Force Publique to open fire on the strikers.

It's unclear who could have targeted the much adored père who was responsible for the introduction of football in the colony but reports indicate that a radical member of the [ROOT.GetName] tribe may have detonated the bomb to express his distrust of the ever increasing power of the Catholic Church.

conbel.2.d:0 "Bunkeya, the faltering jewel of the Garanganze people, lies nestled deep within the Congo-Vrijstaat's southern jungles. Once a bustling center of trade and culture during the reign of the Yeke Kingdom, Bunkeya has long since stagnated in its fall from prosperity. The rule of the joint Flandro-Wallonian-German mission has cast a dark cloud over the colony. Though these Europeans brought the light of civilization, with all of its accompanying technologies and accouterments, they have also brought death and decay. The colony and its native people are overworked by its overseers who use the natives as cheap labor, harvesting the vast natural and mineral riches of the Congo. Though this system has created vast amounts of material wealth for the Flandro-Wallonians, and for Mitteleuropa as a whole, it has also drawn the ire of many natives in the colony. Most prominent among the dissidents of the colonial regime is the Mwami and his loyal followers. The Mwami is the local, rightful ruler to these lands in the eyes of the natives, and his insurrectionary activities continue to be a thorn in the side of our administration and threaten the very stability of our stake here. Before it is too late, a direction must be chosen if the colony is to survive. Whether we crush the Mwami or decide to tolerate their existence, we must be certain it is the correct path. Despite the growing dark clouds on the horizon, both here in the colony and back home on the European mainland, our colonial government must steer itself on a direct and measured course if it is to survive the coming storm."

conbel.5.d:0 "We have received word from our subordinate colony of the Congo-Vrijstaat. For months, Pierre Ryckmans and his administration have fought tooth and nail with the Mwami of the southern Congo in Garanganze. Time and time again, peace talks have almost succeeded, only for such hopes to be dashed by another rise in violent conflict: the region has not known peace or stability for what feels like ages. Finally, through either compromise or force, the last of the Mwami’s forces have been quelled, and it seems peace has been brought to the Congo once more. Whether this peace will last, however, is yet to be seen."

Functioning as a sort of "middle-class" in the colony, the Évolues complete vital functions key to keeping the colony running, from fields such as nursing to engineering. In recognition of their great and patriotic service to the Flanders-Wallonian colonial empire, the Évolues of the Congo colony have finally been awarded for their long and unwavering service. Their reward shall take the form of better housing, better pay, and greater freedoms and rights within the colony. They will also be granted representatives in the colonial congress who, while holding no voting power, can act as observers so the native voice can at least be heard in colonial meetings. Though our more cynical citizens see this as no more than a master petting its obedient dogs, others view this as a small but important step on the road to African self-determination."

Among these various break-off groups, and perhaps most surprisingly, it seems that the mining concerns of the UMHK and their lobbyists and cronies in the capital have risen up in Katanga and declared our current government dead, with the Force Publique garrison in the capital of Leopoldville doing the same, citing our regime’s weakness and inaction. These rebels claim the current administration has kowtowed to the whims of natives and non-important groups for too long, restraining the colonial dream and its basal goals. The UMHK have seized parts of Elisabethville as well as their mining and harvesting operations across the colony and refuse to deescalate the situation while the FP have seized control of the capital and the rest of Bas-Congo, taking the vital port of Matadi with them. \n\nIn response, our cabinet has come up with two possible solutions to our problems. The first option is to simply do nothing and let these rebels continue their operations in peace, with proponents for this plan claiming tensions will cool in the coming weeks and that direct military action would be too hasty or drastic, for these are our colonial brothers, and to fire on them would be madness. Alternatively, the main opposition to this plan is to ride out and crush this insurrection now before it can grow out of hand. The debate raged far into the next morning but by the end of the conference, a clear victor stood among the factions."

Now victorious, our forces may lick their wounds as we work to rebuild our nation that lies nestled in the heart of the Dark Continent. While moving towards reconstruction, the question of our international alignment has come up numerous times, and many in our administration feel that we will need allies in order to maintain order and security.

With faith in Ryckmans’ regime faltering with each misstep in policy or each new native riot that breaks out, many within the colonial administration and settler population wish to wipe clean the current administration and replace it with a more competent one. However, Ryckmans has long stood as a stalwart defender of Congolese interests over favoring either Berlin or Brussels, and if he were to be voted out, the Vrijstaat would likely greatly swing towards one of these two benefactors for aid and legitimacy. \n\nTo replace Ryckmans stands two main alternatives, each pursuing their own agendas. Fighting for increased German interests and control in the Congo is the famed Franz Ritter von Epp, hero of the Weltkrieg and Knight of the German Empire. Under his rule, the Vrijstaat would work towards closer cooperation and even possible full integration into the wider Mittelafrikan patchwork itself, giving the Kaiserreich full access to the Congo’s riches. Alternatively, the Flandro-Wallonian candidate is someone far less controversial than this Kraut - the Force Publique commander Léo Pétillon. Pétillon stands as a staunch pro-Flandro-Wallonian nationalist and minor technocrat - the perfect scion to unleash upon this unruly colony. Whoever is chosen, they will be shouldered with the immense responsibility of administering the Dark Heart of Africa."

From Leopoldville to Haut-Katanga, Force Publique detachments and settler militias wage war against the few remaining German holdouts still left infecting our pristine Eden. At the head of this vile imperialist serpent is the infamous Franz Ritter von Epp, the Kaiser’s highest official in the Vrijstaat, who has ruled over the Congo since Governor-General Ryckmans was replaced. Despite his power, prestige, and links to the German Empire, von Epp has still been increasingly pushed back as his influence and power wanes in this atmosphere of rising chaos and violence. The Congo has reached a fever pitch of anti-German sentiment, and now even the dark, twisting jungles can’t hide these Krauts now.

The foolish Flandro-Wallonians could not hope to handle this chaos-filled primordial paradise, and as such they have lost their mandate to rule over the Congo to our more able administration. \n\n However, with the Epp regime now thoroughly cemented in their position as the new hegemons of the Congo, a final choice on the future of this Eden must be made. Long has this region been a hotbed for separatism, anti-colonialism, and general unrest between both the various native groups and the colonists themselves. To disrupt this carefully-balanced status quo would be suicide to our new regime, or at least many of our more cautious ministers and generals feel so, and so we coulld heed their warnings and merely continue the rule of the old Congo Colony under a the new moniker of the Kongo Freistaat, reserving our autonomy and nominally still accepting the co-rule of our Flandro-Wallonian allies. Alternatively, the far more fervent loyalists, diehard monarchists, and other dedicated ministers within our camp instead seek to go with an opposite approach. These loyalists instead hope to merge the Congo into the wider Mittelafrikan megacolony, integrating Leopoldville directly with Dar-Es-Salaam, and fully uniting the central expanse of Africa under the Iron Cross of the Kaiserreich. \n\nDistinct from these two options however exists a third camp, championed by von Epp himself, who instead seek a middle-ground option. Seeking to cast-off the shared rule of the Flandro-Wallonians, who have proven all to clearly to be poor colonial leaders and incapable of ruling over the Congo, and to instead create a new, purely Afro-German state at the center of this Dark Continent to serve as the new, Germanized crown jewel of the Kaiser’s African ambitions. Under this plan, von Epp would rise as the new Staathalter of a unified and autonomous Deutscher Zentralafrikanischer Staat, finally freeing the Congo from the shackles of lesser rulers and races, and introducing the full might of German culture and governance to these lands while keeping a separate and distinct identity from wider Mittelafrika. Whatever the choice may be, the future of the Congo shall be dictated by the Kaiser as the Dark Heart of Africa falls sway under the Iron Eagle of the Reich."

With Epp comes hundreds of new administrators, generals, bureaucrats, economists, and many more colonial assets - all from a German background and all loyal to Epp and the Kaiser over any former Flandro-Wallonian regime. With these hordes of Huns, Epp seeks to entirely wipe away the last administration that was run by Ryckmans, for Epp sees Ryckamans and his lackeys as nothing but a pack of soft-handed fools unfit for the rigours of colonial duty. As his replacements come in, the Congo shall be increasingly Germanized, bringing with them the ideas of Prussian militarism and pride and German excellence to this wild frontier. Though many fear this may cause a new wave of instability within the colony, many more feel as though the arrival of these Germans is a long overdue one, and with their arrival, perhaps the Congo can finally know some semblance of law and order."

conbel.22.d:0 "Hans Otto Georg Hermann Fegelein has long been a fixture in von Epp’s entourage, serving with the honored commander since his own induction into the German Colonial Service. Despite opportunistically serving under one of the most respected officers in the Kaiserreich however, Fegelein is far from the model soldier von Epp trained him to be. \n\nFegelein’s career in the Mittelafrikan colonies has been mired by one controversy and disciplinary hearing after another, each one more nutritious than the last. From overly harsh punishments towards his own soldiers to committing wholesale slaughter of French and African civilians in the swamps of the Congo, Fegelein has committed more acts of cruelty against both colonials and Africans than most, and yet he still remains in his high position. Fegelein, despite his many flaws and deranged pleasures, is admittedly an efficient, if excessively brutal, colonial administrator and quite the effective military commander to boot, and his usefulness tied with the general aloofness of the Mittelafrikan regime has kept him from being court martialed. \n\nFegelein’s most recent exploit to receive widespread attention and ire from his superiors has caused quite the political quagmire. It seems that after a long weekend of drinking local spirits, chewing khat, and smoking opium with his gang of rough riders and savage soldiers, Fegelein and his crew got into a scuffle with some local African tribals. Getting into a confrontation outside a local biergarten, Fegelein and his men began to harass a group of tribals with racial remarks that soon escalated into physical violence. After beating the Africans senseless and making off with some of their valuables, Fegelein’s posse was chased down by both colonial officers and armed Askari. It would seem that the group of Africans they assaulted and mugged were of royal blood, being the kin of a local Baluba paramount chief that has long been loyal to German rule and particularly to von Epp. To give off the facade of accountability, the colonial officials arrested Fegelein and his men, forcing them to give back the various trinkets and cash stolen from these royals. However, the situation has since spiraled into a minor diplomatic crisis between the German administration and the local chiefs, and von Epp is now up to his neck in bureaucratic annoyances and diplomatic posturing, much to his chagrin. As a result, Fegelhein has been temporarily jailed to maintain some goodwill with the Baluba while this blows over, though his ‘cell’ is more like a quaint and spacious apartment. However, a few of his men did not fare so well, and have been offered up to higher sentences and punishments as a scapegoat for Fegelein - a fact hidden from the Baluba delegation. \n\nSoon, this shall all blow over as von Epp diligently and expertly handles the situation, but many wonder how many times Fegelein can escape true punishment for his misdeeds."

Now thoroughly in charge of the Congo, von Epp must make a choice on where to take this reacquired jewel of Afrika. Sure, von Epp has sworn a lifelong duty to the Kaiser and the German Empire, but the failings of this now-dying empire are as clear as day, and have left von Epp shaken, with his loyalties falling into question. Before this catastrophe, it would have been no choice or even thought for von Epp to immediately send communications to Berlin, reaffirming his loyalty to the Crown and notifying the Kaiser that the Congo was once again thoroughly in German hands, and this is still a choice that lies before the infamous ‘Kaiser’s Hand.’ If he were to bend the knee to Berlin once more, he could choose to accept reality and merely reinforce the Congo, or even go on some grand crusade to reconquer the lands of Mittelafrika and restore the old colonial order. Such decisions would earn him great honors and rewards from the Kaiser and his countrymen, but such a victory pales in comparison to the glories that await von Epp should he turn his back on this decaying imperialist power and instead blaze a new path forth atop his own ambitions. Denying the faltering light of the Kaiser, von Epp could stride forth and retake the lands of Mittelafrika for himself and for his loyal allies and fellow colonials who have proven themselves in Afrika - the world’s last great frontier! The choice is up to von Epp of course, but what shall he choose - to rekindle a dying empire, to accept the grim reality of post-Collapse Afrika, or deny both these paths to chase his destiny and former Germanic glories for the good of all Germans left on the Dark Continent?"

Before this newly-assembled council lay the names of many men who this group may crown, but only one can be emperor, and much debate and thought must go into this decision. Once elected, our new emperor shall become the public facade of our nation - a beacon of stability, tradition, and piety - as von Epp still continues to truly run the nation and its military from the shadows. \n\nWith preparations finished, the chambers to the new imperial senate, built on the grounds of the old colonial office in Leopoldville, buzzed to life with anxiety and expectation as the long and arduous voting process began. Though many, many names have been put forward by the various ex-colonials, paramount chiefs, Bishops, NKR loyalists, and other allies of von Epp, only a few stand any real shot at winning. The most obvious choice to many, and to von Epp himself, is to elect the honorable Crown Prince of Bavaria Rupprecht, whose experience already as a monarch and as a friend of von Epp make him the perfect candidate. In opposition to this, a small group of Belgian ex-colonials and remnants from the Force Publique and UMHK have instead floated the name of the young Prince Badouin, the infantile son of Leopold III, son of Albert, of Flanders-Wallonia, who would likely prove to be easy to control due to his young age and inexperience. \n\nWith these royals already accounted for, that leaves the less likely but still prominent candidates in the running. The various native interest groups and paramount chiefs-turned-electors seek to crown devoted Kamerunian monarchist and German loyalist Alexander Duala Manga Bell while von Epp’s loyalists in the NKR have begun to float names like Hermann Fegelein, von Epp’s right-hand man, as a possible candidate. Meanwhile, non-monarchist Belgian remnants instead call for devout Catholic and nationalist Leon Degrelle to be elected, while some have even been calling for von Epp to simply be crowned himself, for only he has proven his skill and gaul as he moves to retake all of German Africa. \n\nThough who sits on the throne shall matter for little aside from public image and legitimacy, this election is still monumentally important, for it shall dictate who will become the face of our new Holy African Empire.

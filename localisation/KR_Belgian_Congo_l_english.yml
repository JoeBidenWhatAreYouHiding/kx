### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_PIERRE_RYCKMANS_DESC:0 "The Highborn Lord Pierre, 1st Graff Ryckmans, has served the Flandro-Wallonian government for most of his life, as has his family before him for generations back home in Flanders. Born in 1891, Ryckmans comes from a family of esteemed lawyers and politicians, with his father Alphonse serving as a prominent senator in the Flandro-Wallonian Senate as a member of the Catholic Party. His father’s views deeply impacted Ryckmans from a young age, going on to study philosophy at the Catholic University of Leuven before hopping around schools between Germany, Ireland, and Flanders-Wallonia before the horrors of the Weltkrieg began, inspiring him to voluntarily enlist. Originally assigned to the Yser Front, Ryckmans long held an idealized admiration for the Dark Continent and applied to transfer to the colonies for overseas service as soon as he was able. It was here on the battlefields of Africa that Ryckmans made a name for himself as a sound tactician and leader as he fought back against both European soldiers and Mwami warriors, paving the way for his future colonial career post-war. After briefly returning home to finish his law degree and to write and publish the first of his literary works and memoirs, Ryckmans returned to the Congo and was soon elected to become the mayor of Élisabethville - one of the Congo’s largest cities and the main administrative center in the colony. Now, having proven his effectiveness and worth, Pierre Ryckmans serves as Governor-General of the Congo Vrijstaat. Under his leadership, colonial rule shall be maintained at all costs as Ryckmans attempts to drag the ailing Vrijstaat into the modern era."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_CONGO_DESC:0 "Albert I is known by many monikers: Le Roi-Chevalier, Der Koning-Soldaat, Heir to Leopold, and the Exiled King of the Flandro-Wallonians. These titles and honorifics have been bequeathed to him by his people’s adoration, his Godsent birthright, and his valorant acts in the Weltkrieg; and yet this noble ‘Soldier King’ has languished in exile while a German pretender sits on his throne. With the collapse of the previous colonial order under the ‘stewardship’ of the Kaiser’s forces, the Congo Vrijstaat has once again fully returned to the hands of its rightful Flandro-Wallonian masters, free from German meddling for the first time in decades. With this return of the proven pre-Weltkrieg status-quo, the Frandro-Wallonian loyalists within the Vrijstaat made overtures to their exiled king, who has long lived in Canada with the bulk of the Entente exiles, welcoming the Knight King Albert I back to the lands of Leopold’s free state and the center of the once mighty Flandro-Wallonian colonial empire. Though still far from Brussels and his throne, Albert I, rightful King of the Flandro-Wallonians, shall use the Congo as his new staging ground as he and his forces gather their strength to finally overthrow the vile German-backed regime that has stolen his homeland and his birthright from him. The mistakes of the Weltkrieg will be undone as Albert readies to fight for his people and his nation against the wicked Hun for the second time in his honored life."
POLITICS_VON_EPP_DESC:0 "With a career forged in war and colonial conquest, few men are more fit to lead one of the Kaiser’s glorious Afrikan colonies than Franz Ritter von Epp. A Bavarian man through and through, Epp was born in Munich in 1868 to famous realist painter Rudolf Epp, but quickly departed from his father’s artistic pursuits and joined the Munich Military Academy after graduating from school, beginning his storied military career. First seeing life action during the Boxer Rebellion, he would later see multiple deployments across Africa and Asia, most notable of which was his role in the vicious war against the Herero and Namaqua peoples of Südwestafrika. After this long term of colonial service, Epp was drafted into the fires of the Weltkrieg, seeing action in Serbia, Romania, Italy, and France, displaying such valourous and heroic acts that he was knighted by the Kaiser himself following the end of the war. Since then, von Epp has received higher and higher positions throughout His Majesty’s empire, and has now found himself as Staathalter of all of Mittelafrika. Under his rule, German interests shall be paramount above all else as Dar-Es-Salaam draws closer to Berlin."
POLITICS_VON_EPP_CONGO_DESC:0 "With a career forged in war and colonial conquest, few men are more fit to lead one of the Kaiser’s glorious Afrikan colonies than Franz Ritter von Epp. A Bavarian man through and through, Epp was born in Munich in 1868 to famous realist painter Rudolf Epp, but quickly departed from his father’s artistic pursuits and joined the Munich Military Academy after graduating from school, beginning his storied military career.

Since then, von Epp has received higher and higher positions throughout His Majesty’s empire, and has now found himself leading the colonial administration of the Congo. Under his rule German interests shall be paramount above all else as Leopoldville draws closer to Berlin."
POLITICS_LEO_PETILLON_DESC:0 "Léon ‘Léo’ Pétillon is a career civil-servant and once-staunch ally of Pierre Ryckmans, but following his predecessor’s fall from grace, Pétillon has risen to become the new Governor-General of the Congo. Born in 1903 in Esneux, Léo spent his youth slowly training to become a lawyer before joining the Ministry of the Colonies for colonial service in 1929. Since then, Pétillon steadily rose through the ranks of the colonial hierarchy due to his ties to chief ministers in the Flandro-Wallonian parliament and his sharp aptitude for colonial governance. With the fall of the previous cabinet, Pétillon was chosen as the natural successor to Ryckmans’ failed attempt at pseudo-military rule under the Force Publique, and with his technocratic beliefs established during his time as a lawyer and his staunch adherence to Catholicism well-known, the new Governor-General has been seen by many as the humanizing face the Vrijstaat has long sorely needed. Now, the people of the Congo watch Pétillon like a hawk, hoping to see if he is the blessing he truly seems to be."
POLITICS_RUPRECHT_CONGO_DESC:0 "Of noble birth and already familiar with matters related to royalty, Rupprecht, King of Bavaria following his father's death in 1921, is the first elected emperor of the Heiliges Afrikanisches Reich. Born in 1869 into aristocracy as the oldest child of Ludwig III, the last King of Bavaria, and proving himself in the Weltkrieg as an able soldier and commander, this Bavarian blue-blood was chosen by the Prince Electors after much campaigning from von Epp himself, who both respected Rupprecht as a close friend and as a true noble. Not holding any specific desire to truly rule the nation, Rupprecht has been content to be von Epp’s puppet, with their friendship and common military heritage cementing a firm bond between them. Together, these Bavarian boys are the new lords of Africa, and under their rule, civilization shall finally be brought to this Dark Continent."
POLITICS_BELL_CONGO_DESC:0 "The son of Kamerunian native royalty, a pious Catholic, and a devout loyalist to the German colonial regime, the Prince Electors felt that Alexander Duala Manga Bell would be the perfect candidate to appease the African population of our new Holy African Empire. Taking the throne as our first emperor and taking the name Alexander I, Manga Bell is a close friend of von Epp, both serving together in the German colonial service before the Collapse. Initially striking up an acquaintanceship over their mutual respect for one another, the two have come to grow into close friends and allies, with von Epp and Alexander ruling as practical equals - something no one in von Epp’s inner-circle expected. Under Alexander I, this new empire shall strive to create a true atmosphere of African-colonial cooperation and mutual respect, emulating the example set by its two patriarchs, and under Alexander’s rule, modernity and stability shall finally reign here in Africa without losing any aspect of our diverse and syncretic culture."
POLITICS_VON_EPP_KAISER_DESC:0 "Saving German colonialism and imperialism within the Congo itself, Franz Ritter von Epp took control of the Congo in its darkest hour and steered it to safety and stability. Since these displays of heroism and apt command, von Epp has risen to become respected, if not beloved, within the Congo by many. Turning his back on the Kaiser he once swore fealty to after becoming disillusioned with the festering Kasierreich, von Epp set out to create his own fiefdom in Africa. Establishing the Heiliges Afrikanisches Reich and by rallying the Elector Counts, von Epp has brought true prestige and civilization to the Dark Continent. With the Prince Electors’ decision to elect von Epp in a unanimous vote, this Bavarian wardog received the greatest promotion he has received yet over the course of his vast and decorated military career, as he ascended to become our first emperor. Now ruling as Franz I, von Epp has achieved his dreams of creating a new Catholic, Germanic homeland free of the failures of the dying Reich that rots from its core in Berlin. By bringing together Germans, Flandro-Wallonians, Africans, and all others within our new empire under our new Emperor’s banner, true salvation and stability shall finally reign here in Africa’s Dark Heart."
POLITICS_THE_BABY_DESC:0 "Elected by the Prince Electors as a compromise candidate with the Flandro-Wallonian remnants that still control much of the economic apparatus of our new empire, the young Emperor Baudouin I has been elected as the first high sovereign of the Holy African Empire, despite being just a boy. Born in 1930, he is the grandson of the Soldier King Albert and the son of Albert’s heir Leopold III. As one of the only candidates presented by the Prince Electors of true royal blood, Baudouin gives our strange and ostracized Empire a sliver of legitimacy within the eyes of the European monarchies, not like that matters to our glorious new realm anyway. One day he may also sit on his ancestors’ throne back in Brussels, but for now this child-emperor is perfectly content being the Suzerain of Africa. Despite being a puppet of von Epp and his ambitions, Baudouin is none the wiser and has taken to his ‘Uncle Eppy.’ Together, the two have come to be adored in the eyes of many of their subjects, and Baudoin has become the darling of the nation. With this duo at the helm and with the Prince Electors behind them, stability and continued cooperation between our various factions is all but assured."
POLITICS_FEGELEIN_DESC:0 "How Hermann Fegelein has come to rule over Africa as its new emperor is quite the story, and one he regales often to any and all who will hear it. A devout loyalist to his commanding officer Franz Ritter von Epp, Fegelein has served his old mentor and friend since his youth. Born in 1906 as Hans Otto Georg Hermann Fegelein, he has been crowned as Hermann I, taking his preferred name of Hermann over Hans, by von Epp and the Prince Electors in order to maintain a tight bond between von Epp’s inner circle. A fiercely intelligent and capable military commander specializing in cavalry and fast attack tactics, Fegelein’s quick wit and skill have served him well. Though he may merely be a figurehead and a puppet to von Epp and his ambitions, ‘Hermann I’ takes his crown seriously and his new position with pride, wishing to serve both his new subjects and his old master without failure. Taking to this new life swiftly, Hermann I has already proven to be an able ruler, or at least an able puppet, and has also taken to the perks and privileges of royal life with great gusto. Though von Epp still treats him as he always has and though many within the nation merely see him as a pretender needed to keep stability and prestige, Fegelein cares not. As he walks the streets, his new subjects chant ‘Fegelein! Fegelein! Fegelein!’ in adoration of their new emperor, and he waves back at them - knowing in his heart that he is their savior."

COG_Dominer_Pour_Servir:0 "Dominer pour Servir"
COG_Dominer_Pour_Servir_desc:0 "'Dominate to Server'. These simple words define the colonial policy that the old Belgian government decreed in the Congo. The Congolese are our children and we have to raise and lift them so they too can enjoy the virtues of Western Progress. This is a slow process and while it hopes to reward the Congolese in the end, colonial rule isn't supposed to disappear for many more years."
COG_Restoration_Missions:0 "Restoration of the Missions"
COG_Restoration_Missions_desc:0 "Due to aggressive German policies against the power of the catholic church, many of our mission posts have been abandoned.

COG_Elections_Herminestadt:0 "Allow Free Elections in the Congo"
COG_Elections_Herminestadt_desc:0 "The only way to consolidate power and satisfy our German overlords is to allow for free and fair elections within the colony.

COG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap:0 "Abolish the Invisible Colour Gap"
COG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap_desc:0 "While unlike the British or French colonies there never was a distinct colour gap in Congo, a glass ceiling blocked the Congolese from reaching high administrative or political positions.

COG_Limit_Native_Careers:0 "Limit Native Careers"
COG_Limit_Native_Careers_desc:0 "Unlike many of the other colonial powers, the UMHK allowed natives to operate the heavy machinery and held large training programs to successfully educate the workforce.

COG_Centre_Extra_Coutumiers_desc:0 "While the system of Chefferies worked well in the past, the growing population and the questionable loyalty of the cheffs has pushed the government to create their own economic centres on the countryside.

COG_Technical_University_Herminestadt:0 "Technical University of Élisabethville"
COG_Technical_University_Herminestadt_desc:0 "Due to the large growth of the UMHK over the last years, they have offered the government a large amount of funds to help in the creation of a technical university in Élisabethville.

COG_Access_To_The_Sea_desc:0 "Our economy is primarily based around the sale and export of the various resources and materials extracted from the rich Congo. For this to continue, sea access is vital, but yet there is an obstacle to this goal - there is but one large seaport in all of the Congo. Unfortunately, recent developments in Leopoldville have left our main port at Matadi non operational. We must find a way to export our goods or else our fragile economy could slip further into collapse."

COG_Luanda_Port:0 "Economic Support from Portugal"
COG_Luanda_Port_desc:0 "A solution to our financial problems lies in opening up to powers outside of Mittelafrika, especially Portugal, which is an undeniable maritime trading power that is also close to us territorially thanks to the colony of Angola to the south.

COG_Diamond_Mines_Kivu_desc:0 "With our control over the region of Kivu being fully established, we have secured the exclusive right to exploit some of the world's most lucrative diamond mines. We should get started immediately and break ground on the known untapped deposits and seams while we expand the few current mines operating on-site. Additionally, we shall send new survey teams out into the surrounding jungles and hills to prospect for new sources.

With this harsh reality realized, our Vrijstaat is truly alone. Rather than cave at the idea of this isolation, we shall instead use it to our advantage.

Sure, we have been free in name, but never in reality,being slaves to the imperialist ambitions and greed-fueled desires of monarchs and politicians thousands of miles away from here. This perverse arrangement has gone on long enough, and now we have solidified our sovereignty against these corrupt overseers to rectify this egregious situation.

Though he started the Congo’s modernization and civilizing processes, turning the Congo into a profitable venture for rubber production, ivory sourcing, and mining, he did so through committing brutal acts against the native Congolese. Though harsh, Leopold II’s rule showed that in the Congo, profitable results required sacrifice, and so we will replicate his methods in a more modern and less barbaric way in order to further his civilizing mission here in the Congo."

Luckily, the Congo’s vast stores of natural resources and amazing environments shall provide us with everything we could possibly need, for these jungles and deltas are among the most rich and verdant in all the world.

Though the pursuit of good governance and greater profit is all well and good, they are nothing next to godliness. Christianity uplifts and it civilizes, and so the Church and missionaries shall be given full access to our great state to proselytize and establish themselves as they please, for they will be our states tool to civilize the Congolese savages. The Congo shall be Christ’s kingdom in central Africa!"

Without their armed masses, we would be tossed to the wolves and torn apart by the savages and mongrels that stalk the African wilderness. The Force Publique shall become a key arm of the state, out-ranking many government and civilian institutions as an official branch of the government.

From gold and silver to iron and uranium deposits to rubber tree forests that stretch for acres and underground deposits of oil and natural gas, the Congo is one of the most bountiful paradises on this planet - a true Eden on Earth. To ensure these resources are efficiently extracted and processed, the UMHK and other resource conglomerates in the Congo shall coalesce together into a central economic planning board, becoming an official arm of the state as the chief economic bureaucracy of the Congo.

Though this alliance failed once, it will not fail again, for we and our fellow exiles know that our crusade is holy and righteous, for we shall not rest until the lands of our ancestors are cleansed of radicalism and foreign hegemonies.

Nearly 30,000 African soldiers fought for the Congo in that horrific war, and it was with these native lives that the Congo lived and died with. Once again, we must rely on this colony's immense population to fuel the coming war effort and fill out our divisions. We must conscript the natives to work both in the factories and to hold a gun on the frontline, for without their manpower, our crusade to retake Brussels is doomed to fail.

Since then rubber plantations have grown to stretch across much of our colonies once-stocked and healthy rubber forests. Primarily in Bas-Congo, these plantations already stretch for hundreds of acres, producing liquid cash with each bucket of sap collected.

Despite their best efforts, however, the influence of these Flandro-Wallonian imperialists and settlers is waning fast. \n\nThis atmosphere of crumbling chaos has come to minorly benefit the Congo, supplying the Force Publique with weapons and the colonial administration with economic aid, but has also greatly destabilized the colony and the very foundations of Flandro-Wallonian rule while also greatly inflaming native tensions who continue to riot and strike against colonial rule.

congo.0.d:0 "For decades, the Flandro-Wallonians have been the sovereign lords of the Congo, since the reign of Leopold II to the modern Ryckmans regime enforced by the Force Publique. However, since ‘Belgium’s’ loss in the Weltkrieg, their nation and their empire have been subservient to the Kaiser’s will, for even Wilhelm’s own son sits upon the Belgian throne. With this new war-forged reality in place, the newly-minted Flandro-Wallonians were allowed to keep their colonial regime within the Congo intact and their hierarchies in one piece, but a new German element was forced into the system as overlords to the ingrained Belgian regime. \n\nOver the years since the Weltkrieg, German influence has increasingly weathered the foundations of the Flandro-Wallonian regime, and the current Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans has let the situation slowly spiral out of hand. With traditionalist insurrectionists waging a guerilla war in Katanga, Askari and small Socialist groups actively protesting and campaigning for independence in Kivu and the Capital, and with religious fanatics and rogue mercenaries gnawing at our roots in the North and West, the Vrijstaat’s current situation is dubious to say the least. Governor-General Ryckmans must quickly deal with the major issues affecting the colony lest it fall into chaos, yet with the mismanagement of Dar-Es-Salaam looming over us, it may be outside our control. Regardless, our regime must soldier on and preserve the Trinité Coloniale of God, Gold, and Civilization lest we collapse into savagery and chaos as the ever-present Hun further forces its presence."

The capital of the local colonial administrative province, Kamina was the local jewel of the Flandro-Wallonian regime, with a burgeoning merchant quarter and a vibrant tapestry and woodworking industry fueled by skilled native workers now employed by the colonials. All of this prosperity has been erased in the wake of the Mwami’s wrath, for he has resolved himself to make himself known in the minds of the imperialists forever as this aging king passes through his twilight years. On the eve of this week’s dawn, Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila commanded his forces to break their usual guerilla tactics to instead rally and march on the Kamina in a show of force. Quickly overwhelming the meager Force Publique garrison defending the city, these savage and bloodthirsty native warriors have begun to entrench deep in the heart of the city and along its Northern reaches as they burn the rest of this colonial hive to the ground. \n\nAs a result, hundreds of loyal colonials have been slaughtered and much of our economic and military assets within the city have been completely destroyed. We must now decide how best to deal with this act of violence, and with Governor-General Ryckmans’ regime barely holding together as in, this surely will be a test for his administration, for should he fail, the higher-ups back in Europe always have a list of possible replacements waiting..."

Led by Franz Ritter von Epp, Reinhard Heydrich, and other disillusioned veterans within the Mittelafrikan administration and military. Long seeking their own power and sensing our growing position of weakness, von Epp has begun to make political moves within our regime, confirming our long-held suspicions that ‘the Kaiser’s Hand’ seeks power in the Congo for himself. Making their distaste for our rule official, von Epp and the NKR have officially denounced the Ryckmans administration, and have begun to openly and actively campaign both against Ryckmans and for von Epp as the next Governor-General of the Vrijstaat. Whether this posturing will remain empty threats or escalate into an actual political challenge remains to be seen, but with von Epp’s honors and reputation, he is not an opponent we want."

With the Southern reaches of the city completely ablaze, we have sent what few engineers and support staff to fight the blaze to keep it from spreading further into the city as our main detachments of the Force Publique move in around the flanks and the Northern end to begin the siege. \n\nSlaughtering what few Mwami loyalists that were foolish enough not to seek refuge inside the inner-city, the FP consolidated their position and formed a mighty blockade around the rest of the city as they send in their initial recon teams to scout out the internal situation of the Mwami’s forces and to assess the state of Kamina’s defences. Now, it is only a matter of time before the enemy makes their move, or simply surrenders to our clearly superior forces."
congo.23.a:0 "Tighten the perimeter and starve them out!"

congo.24.t:0 "The Assault on Kamina"
congo.24.d:0 "After cutting off their supply lines and starving their forces of basic necessity for weeks, the Mwami’s loyalist have fallen to salvaging the city of Kamina for supplies through looting in order to survive, turning much of the city against their occupation as their would-be saviours transform into new oppressors. With this atmosphere of division and in-fighting, we have been presented the perfect opportunity to strike as chaos consumes their ranks. As the preparations were finalized, Commander of the FP Léo Petillion began ordering our troops all along the Northern border of the city to begin the march as the flanks were covered by our supporting garrisons in the East and West. With this closing pincer, we shall push the Mwami’s forces back into the inferno they caused that still consumes the Southern districts. With their only avenue of escape cut-off and with their troops ready to mutiny and nearly out of supplies, the Mwami’s forces have become a cornered and wounded fox, and now all we need do is deliver the final blow!"
congo.24.a:0 "Fix bayonets! We enter Kamina at once!"

congo.25.t:0 "The Mwami Retreats"
congo.25.d:0 "Charging at the Mwami’s disorganized lines, our loyal troops in the Force Publique crumbled the morally-broken natives, pushing them into the Southern blaze as Commander Petillion led his men in a savage reprisal campaign against the Mwami’s troops. Broken and routed, the few surviving native troops fled through back alleys and sewer passages to escape, taking with them the Mwami who was personally leading the forces within the city. Despite this snake slipping through our fingers once more, the bulk of his forces have been slaughtered or captured, and though Kamina still burns, we stand victorious!"
congo.25.a:0 "The future's looking bleak for these savages. Chase them into the jungles!"

congo.26.t:0 "Victory, but at What Cost?"
congo.26.d:0 "With the horrific bloodshed of Kamina and the Mwami’s gambit now behind us, the aftermath of such a disaster has come to follow. The city still burns, with artillery fire from our assault only adding to the inferno, with the fires now spreading into the city-center and the Eastern district as well. In the areas of the city not ablaze, rubble and the dead litter the streets where clean-up operations are slowly underway, and the smoke and stench from this horrific site can be seen and smelt for miles as the vultures and hyenas come to the city to feast upon the bounty of carrion. \n\nAcross the colony, the Ryckmans Regime has received nothing but backlash and criticism over this calamity, with much of the Vrijstaat blaming the Governor-General for the wanton destruction of a provincial capital and the deaths of hundreds of civilians - both colonials and native Congolese. With this newest disaster only being the latest in a long series of missteps and controversies, anticolonial sentiment is once again on the rise and many have begun to call for Ryckmans to resign and for another, more respected and competent colonial to take the reins of power, while others have even begun to call for native rule. Though Ryckmans is still solidly in command, and those who call for his resignation have little power, he and his administration must shape up and be wary, for the cracks are starting to show."
congo.26.a:0 "We must be careful, for the first deep cracks in Ryckmans’ regime are beginning to show."

congo.27.t:0 "A Return to the Status Quo"
congo.27.d:0 "At last, after a long clean-up operation and reconstruction campaign, the city of Kamina has largely been restored, save for large amounts of tribal housing and farmlands that were forever lost in the raging inferno. The dead have been buried, the walls and merchant quarter have been restored, and the garrison forces have been relieved and replaced. Though outrage against the Ryckmans Regime is still raging, it has lessened since the initial conflict, and the relative calm that once existed here has begun to return. However, the Vrijstaat is still a disconnected, unstable, and chaotic colony, and new dangers are always awaiting around the corner..."
congo.27.a:0 "Colonial order is restored...for now."

congo.28.t:0 "The Great Leopoldville Riots"
congo.28.d:0 "With ire and discontent towards the colonial regime only growing with Ryckmans’ recent blunders, the nascent and infantile Congolese nationalist and home-rule movements have begun to skyrocket in popularity, largely driven on by a new generation of young firebrands both sick of the Évolués and their complacency, and with the colonials and their horrific and oppressive rule. With rising figures such as Joseph Kasa-Vubu and Moïse Tshombe championing regionalist ideas in opposition to nationalist unifiers like Daniel Kanza and Jean Bolikango as young radicals like Joseph Kasongo, Cyrille Adoula, and Isaac Kalonji leave their lives steeped in Western education and influence to stoke the fires of Socialist agitation, everywhere within the Congo has seen rising nativist agitation. However, this conflict and unrest is better showcased nowhere else than within the capital of the Vrijstaat - the great and grand African metropolis of Leopoldville. \n\nWith the recent controversies playing their part in furthering the colony-wide unrest, Leopoldville has become the chaotic and churning cauldron that lies at the source of this conflict, ready to bubble over and pour out of the city and into the wider Congo. At dawn this morning, the local Force Publique garrison under Armand Huyghé and Émille Janssens were met with far more than the regular protests and rabble as tens of thousands of angry ‘Kinshasans’ as they call themselves began to march on the colonial capital. Armed with captured colonial equipment and factory tools, this mass of native Congolese swarmed across the city, looting and rioting as they went in a pure and violent expression of anti-colonial sentiment that has been building for years. Notably, one local known as Leonard Mpoyi has made a name for himself by leading a charge into the FP garrisons, stealing weapons and supplies and distributing them to the other protestors. Though the situation has not spiraled out of control just yet, the FP remains ever-vigilant, and more troops from outside the capital are being relocated closer to the city to act as support. Though these riots will likely be put down soon and these locals will return to their normal lives, this massive demonstration has shown our administration that the natives of the Congo are getting serious about sovereignty, and that their independence movements have clear leaders now pulling the strings behind the scenes."
congo.28.a:0 "We must stay vigilant!"

congo.29.t:0 "Anti-Ryckmans Sentiment on the Rise"
congo.29.d:0 "Through damage control and careful diplomacy, we have attempted to fix the public-relations nightmare that the ‘Folly at Kamina’ has caused - and it has been a complete and utter failure. Disapproval and outrage against the Ryckmans’ Regime has never been higher, and what was once small and disconnected calls for new leadership or a change in direction have evolved and coalesced into a violent torrent of public outrage calling for Ryckmans’ resignation. Though the colonial administration has so-far pushed back on these calls for a new order in the Vrijstaat, they have still begun to prepare candidates for replacement just in case. Among the various Force Publique veterans, colonial administrators, and Old Guard generals in the running, two names have risen to the top above all others - Léo Petillion, one of the leading figures of the FP and the Hero of Kamina, and Franz Ritter von Epp, leading figure of the NKR and the ‘Kaiser’s Hand’ here in the Congo. Though Ryckmans is still Governor-General and his word is still law, he must watch his back lest his allies stab him in the back and throw him to the wolves as a scapegoat for the colony’s latest missteps."

These words embody the colonial mission here in the Vrijstaat, for the ultimate loyalty to their nation and their countrymen is to dominate the African continent, or at least the Congo colony, and all those who reside in it. This harsh doctrine is for the good of the Crown and for the good of the colony, for with colonization comes civilization, or so they say. \n\nIn response to the Mwami’s recent occupation of Kamina, the current colonial regime under [COG.getleader] has declared its intent to double-down on their doctrine of domination for profit and patriotism, flying in the face of recent calls for liberalizing measures to appease the rowdy savages. The Trinité Coloniale must be preserved at all costs, and the Vrijstaat and its government are intent on doing everything in their power to uphold this mighty imperialist dynasty.

Due to their loss in Kamina earlier this year, his troops are widely undersupplied and lacking in even the most basic of equipment. Meanwhile, the Force Publique, though still widely armed with Weltkrieg-era weapons, has been preparing for this rising tide of unrest with new supplies from requisitioned Europe. It would seem that conflict within the Congo is far from over, and the Force Publique has been ordered to the lands of the Mwami once more to put down this foolish and aging king."

Meanwhile, the first trucks loaded with our troops have arrived in Bunkeya, and the city has been mostly secured without much bloodshed or pushback.

However, in our foolish overconfidence, we had ordered our forces to wait to advance for the moment our bombs stopped falling on the old fortress, and in this brief window, the Mwami and a small detachment of his vanguard and closest advisors were able to slip away in old tunnels beneath the surface.

congo.79.d:0 "With our war in Africa going poorly, the Congolese began to gain ground, and now have near-complete control over our African colonies. This dire situation has begun to cause our economy to hemorrhage, and the people at home ache for peace, citing that this war is useless to those in need at home. With this in mind, many within our cabinet have begun to urge us to sue for peace with the Congolese, though that would likely mean ceding most of our African holdings to them. The alternative however, would require us to rally the troops and launch a full-scale invasion of Africa’s Dark Heart - an idea no one cherishes. With our backs to the wall and instability mounting, what shall we do?"

In exchange for ending all hostilities, they would be willing to cede their nearby African colonies to us, no strings attached. Should we accept this generous offer of surrender, for their deal gives us everything we wanted in the first place, or shall we simply deny these fools and crush them under our boots?

#Flavour

congofla.1.t:0 "Football in the Congo"
congofla.1.d:0 "Due to Belgian influence and Catholic missionaries from West-Flanders, football is slowly becoming the most important religion in the Congo. Organised by Père Raphaël de la Kethulle football matches and small championships are held throughout Élisabethville. Through growing mining cités and the continued education policy of our governor, the père hopes to improve social promotion of the Africans and has requested the government to further expand his vision by the creation of the Association Sportive Congolaise."
congofla.1.a:0 "Approve the organisation."

congofla.2.t:0 "Recognition from the Flemish-Wallonian Football Association"
congofla.2.d:0 "The FWFA has eagerly observed the growing popularity of football and the Congo and has decided to pump further funding into the Association Sportive Congolaise, upgrading its infrastructure, providing better support and even allowing for promotion into the Flemish-Wallonian cup. To further strengthen the bonds between the two organisations, the Beerschot club has announced their visit to Élisabethville to face off against the best of our nation. To show off the successful return of the colonial regime, plans for a new station are being drafted named after Adalbert I."
congofla.2.a:0 "Show them that the Congo has entered the 20th century!"

congofla.3.t:0 "King Adalbert Stadium"
congofla.3.d:0 "Built under the careful supervision of père de la Kethulle and funded by the Association Sportive Congolaise, hundreds of workers have been building for months to finish the prestige project of the Colonial government. Due to the père hundreds of Katangese school children have volunteered to aid in the construction as well hoping to one day be able to become world stars and play in the Flemish-Wallonian league. Built for over 50.000 supporters the stadium is supposed to become the centre of the Élisabethville sport associations with an athletics club planned as well."
congofla.3.a:0 "Slowly the building grows."

congofla.4.t:0 "Élisabethville-Beerschot"
congofla.4.d:0 "Finally the big day has approached, Beerschot has flown from Brussel to Élisabethville to play against the Élisabethville club who was able to defeat Bunkeya in a close 4-3 last month. Accompanied by loud music and even a performance of the Force Publique orchestra, the stadium has started to fill up with more than 50.000 Katangese already inside and more than 20.000 waiting outside. With a burning sun shining on the supporters, the match began with a goal from Mokuna against the Flemish-Wallonian keeper. The Beerschot attackers were able to turn the tide around at the 42 minute mark scoring two goals against the failing Élisabethville defence, placing the score 2-1 at half-time. During the second half, three more attacks by Beerschot were blocked by the Élisabethville defence and Mokuna was able to score another goal at the 76 minute placing the final score at 2-2. Ecstatic with the beautiful performance their team was able to present the Flemish-Wallonians, celebrations continued deep into the night together with the Beerschot supporters."

congofla.5.t:0 "Muhemili Abeli against the UMHK"
congofla.5.d:0 "After getting caught for stealing a bed, 7 chairs, 5 tables and even a washbasin, Muhemili Abeli has been brought to trial for repeated theft and trade with the black market. She countered that due to the reforms pushed by UMHK after the Black Monday scandal, many of the workers can't afford their life necessities anymore and that she resulted in stealing to sustain her family. Support for her case has been growing in the cité indigène where many more miners have fallen on tough times after the firing of 300 miners last year."
congofla.5.a:0 "Start aid measures."

congofla.6.t:0 "Further scandals in the UMHK"
congofla.6.d:0 "A study in the Élisabethville paper has been published outlining the atrocities committed by the UMHK against the Hutu population of Rwanda. By promising them wealth and success, many unemployed men have travelled to Élisabethville to be employed in the mines. Insisting that they are naturally protected against low oxygen environments due to their mountainous home and don't need the 'Chambres à Vapeur' to acclimate to the situation down below, many of these men have died from loss of oxygen or malaria and secretly buried away from the general public. Now the study has leaked out to the population of Élisabethville resulting in a massive strike against the UMHK until better working conditions can be guaranteed. Over in the Colonial government, debate is also occurring over the replacement of the Chefs in the mine of question to deter exploding anti-colonialist thoughts."
congofla.6.a:0 "Fire all the Overseers."

congofla.7.t:0 "Conflict within the UMHK"
congofla.7.d:0 "In continuation of the pre-Weltkrieg colonial policy, the UMHK has once again dedicated itself to a combination of complex bureaucracy and a general patronising attitude towards it's workers. Due to the expansion of the corporation over the years however this combination is no longer viable for the entire firm leading to loopholes and unjustified punitive measures against the wrong miner. After the economic crisis of 1936, many of the miners are now completely at the mercy of the company, depending on them for food, social facilities, accomodation. To cut back their losses, the UMHK decided to cut back spending for these facilities, causing a general decline in the welfare of the Katangese and increasing calls for better loans and houses now that the economy is back in upswing."
congofla.7.a:0 "Discuss with the UMHK board of directors."

congofla.8.t:0 "Workshop burned down"
congofla.8.d:0 "Near the Ruashi mines, fires have burned down multiple workshops causing the work to come to a complete stop. It looks like it was a deliberate act of arsonry by some of the workers as a protest against the low wages and old housing facilities."
congofla.8.a:0 "Improve the housing facilities."

congofla.9.t:0 "UMHK demolishes a cemetery"
congofla.9.d:0 "In their recent expansion of the cobalt mines in South-the Congo, a group of Flemish-Wallonian construction engineers has accidentally destroyed a local cemetery causing outrage amongst the population who claim that the colonials have no respect for their culture and traditions and are purely here for profit. In Élisabethville, the situation is escalating with multiple shops and cafes run by colonials getting thrashed and a general strike in the UMHK. The colonial government is debating whether to take this opportunity to finally complete the nationalisation of the UMHK, forcing the company to directly change its policy and offer better working conditions to the native workforce."
congofla.9.a:0 "Nationalise the UMHK."
congofla.9.b:0 "Leave the company independent."

congofla.10.t:0 "General strike of Élisabethville"
congofla.10.d:0 "After yet another large amount of lay-offs at the UMHK without compensation, hundreds of miners have gathered in the Stade Roi Adalbert to confront the mayor of the city and discuss possible repercussions for the UMHK. Due to a planned visit to Bunkeya however, Pierre Ryckmans wasn't able to meet with the strikers and has sent his deputy Amour Maron to handle the situation. When Léonard Mpoyi and his colleagues however started presenting their evidence to the gathered council, Amour Maron shot the man next to Mpoyi point blank and ordered the Force Publique to open fire on the strikers. Over 50 miners were shot dead with hundreds of wounded. The strike has been quelled but for how long...?"
congofla.10.a:0 "Increase the Force Publique garrison in the cité indigène."

congofla.11.t:0 "Mutiny in the Élisabethville Barracks"
congofla.11.d:0 "Instigated by the aggressive reaction of Amour against the striking workers of the UMHK, Premier sergent-major Ngoie Mukalabushi has revolted against the colonial administration working together with Mpoyi to undermine the Flemish-Wallonian regime and bring full independence to the Congo. Hundreds of miners following Mpoyi have joined forces with the mutinous Force Publique, forcing themselves a way into the white quarter to topple the regime."

congofla.12.t:0 "Death of Jeanie Prentice"
congofla.12.d:0 "Arriving in Congo in 1900 as part of the English [ROOT.GetName] evangelical mission, Jeanie Prentice greatly defined the influence of the church in the Congo. When she finally died last friday, she was the oldest living colonial in Congo and loved by both the colonials as the Katangese."
congofla.12.a:0 "A sad day for the Congo."

congofla.13.t:0 "Assassination attempt of Père Raphaël"
congofla.13.d:0 "At 5.16 pm today a car bomb shook Élisabethville when the car that was supposed to transport Père Raphaël from the colonial headquarters to the Stade Roi Adalbert exploded killing the driver and wounding 8 more people. It's unclear who could have targeted the much adored Père who was responsible for the introduction of football in the colony but reports indicate that a radical member of the Garanganze tribe may have detonated the bomb to express his distrust of the ever increasing power of the Catholic Church. His attempt seemed to have caused the opposite with more and more citizens deciding to abandon their tribal past and become part of the growing population of évolués in the cities."
congofla.13.a:0 "Thank God he wasn't hurt."

congofla.14.t:0 "An Announcement of Pragmatism"
congofla.14.d:0 "In a groundbreaking announcement, Governor-General Ryckmans has called for a sudden shift in the ‘Politique Indigène,’ or native policy, of the Vrijstaat. Organizing a meeting of the local paramount chiefs, tribal monarchs, and other autonomous indigeneous leaders within the Congo, Ryckmans and his administration hopes to soothe native-colonial relations once and for all to prevent more chaos and unrest from spreading within our colony. Seeking to adopt a policy of pragmatic association, the Governor hopes that by working with these local leaders instead of curbing their influence at every turn may be far more conducive to a stable and functional Vrijstaat. These leaders will be given further rights and autonomy as the colonial administration adopts a more agreeable and less oppressive attitude towards them. \n\nTo solidify this new atmosphere of cooperation, Ryckmans has called for a grand meeting and feast to be held in Leopoldville, inviting each and every of the hundreds of local tribal rulers, chiefs, and representatives from across our colony’s vast expanse. Giving a toast thanking each and every of the countless leaders by name, Ryckamns was nearly winded by the end of the feast’s inaugural speech, but with this token symbol of respect given and these new pragmatic policies passed, Ryckamns hopes to earn his true goal from these new policies: loyalty from the notoriously unruly native majority, but only time will tell if his new stance pays off."
congofla.14.a:0 "Let us hope these Blue Bloods and their colonial allies have our best interests at heart."

congofla.15.t:0 "Deals from a Smoke-filled Room"
congofla.15.d:0 "In a dank and crusty motel room in the heart of Elisabethville, Edgar Sengier and Governor Ryckmans smoked fat cigars and drank chilled brandy while hashing out a series of new deals and compromises to ensure the Vrijstaat’s economy, mainly fueled by Sengier’s UMHK, runs smoothly as ever. Promising a slew of incentives and special exemptions for UMHK operations and properties, Ryckmans hopes to win the loyalty of these captains of industry with bribery and flattery, for without the help of these rich Belgians, the Vrijstaat’s economy would completely collapse. Though this will further tie ourselves to the whims of these greedy entrepreneurs and industrialists, it is a necessary evil to secure our prosperity and stability, and it’s not like we won’t benefit ourselves from these deals, for the UMHK and its dealings can be quite lucrative indeed."
congofla.15.a:0 "Let's hope these deals amount to more than just some drunk colonials rambling in a room."

congofla.16.t:0 "Dancing on the Edge of a Knife"
congofla.16.d:0 "The Congo exists in a state of limbo, stranded between the great beacons of influence that are Brussels and Berlin, the two European capitals that lord over the Vrijstaat. With the Ryckmans regime stuck in the middle of this imperialist dichotomy, the ruling administration of the Vrijstaat is constantly pulled towards one liege or the other due to foreign influencers playing a game of tug-o-war for the riches of our tropical paradise. However, the Congo colony continues to survive, and Flandro-Wallonian influence still holds strong in the face of the German hegemony in a carefully maintained balance entirely due to Governor Ryckmans tactful leadership and his ability to play the two imperialist powers off each other for the wider benefit of the Vrijstaat itself. Though he is loyal to both his new masters and his old homeland, Ryckmans himself puts his new home above all, and will ensure that the greed and ambitions of Flanders-Wallonia and the Kaiserreich do not tear his beloved Vrijstaat apart."
congofla.16.a:0 "Torn between Berlin and Brussels, we will find our place thanks to Ryckamns."

congofla.17.t:0 "Ryckmans’ Vrijstaat"
congofla.17.d:0 "With chaos and bloodshed long behind our noble colony, Pierre Ryckmans and his administration have done the seemingly impossible and tamed the wild Congo. Through pragmatic policy with the native Congolese, prosperity-inducing economic legislation, and pious adherence to the Christian faith, the Vrijstaat has evolved from a rich but crumbling colony on the brink of collapse to a stable bastion of Flandro-Wallonian and German imperialism.With the Governor seemingly pulled from his downward spiral and slapped into some sense after his long bout as an ineffectual administrator, Ryckmans has proven himself able to lead this massive colony, and now must continue his work to bring civilization and modernity to this Dark Heart of Africa. Though the road will still be fraught with danger and agents of malcontent, the people of the Congo can breathe a sigh of relief as they put their faith in Governor Ryckmans."
congofla.17.a:0 "The Colonial Trinity holds firm under Governor-General Ryckmans!"

congofla.18.t:0 "Plan Décennal"
congofla.18.d:0 "With his administration now finding its footing, Governor Léon Pétillon has decided to go through with his ambitious economic reform scheme named ‘Plan Décennal’, or the Ten-year Plan. Mainly a modernization and westernization scheme, Plan Décennal seeks to, as the name suggests, revolutionize and massively expand the Congo’s economic and industrial sectors within a decade, bringing newfound prosperity and affluence to all the Congo. Never before has such an ambitious economic plan been seen here in Mittelafrika, especially one that would bring such widespread assistance and growth, for Pétillon’s plan not only seeks to aid the colonial population, but the vast majority of the Congo’s citizens as well, for in his eyes no living soul in this colony is exempt from assistance and the light of civilization. Functioning like a temporary planned economy built around a foundation of pro-entrepreneurial and Christian capitalist ideals, this 10-year Plan, if successful, would be one of the greatest economic miracles the world has ever seen, dragging tens of millions of Africans and colonials out of poverty on a scale never before witnessed. With the initial stages of the plan beginning to go into effect, the people of the Vrijstaat wait with bated breath to see if Pétillon’s scheme pays off, or if it fails like so many other past colonial ventures."
congofla.18.a:0 "A fool-proof plan to industrialize and modernize our new homeland!"

congofla.19.t:0 "A Technocratic Colonial Order"
congofla.19.d:0 "An avowed Christian Technocrat with ties to the Flandro-Wallonian Parti Catholique and Parti Social Chrétien, Governor Léon Pétillon has long been open about his unique views on good governance. With enough power and influence now to bring these ideas to reality within the Congo, Pétillon has moved to reorganize the ruling administration under the Governor’s position along Technocratic lines. Calling for competent and colonial intelligentsia, technical experts, and educated holymen to run the economy and the colonial administration, these experts would organize themselves into sectors based on their own expertise and be responsible for overseeing and managing said sectors. Arguing that this system is not only more rational, but also far more productive, efficient, and above all, more conducive to a stable colonial order. To aid in the organization efforts of this new system, Pétillon and his friends in the PSC and PC back in Wallonia have also organized a system of voluntary Christian unions, allowing our workers to organize and cooperate without the threat of Socialism looming over our heads. With this new Technocratic system in place, Governor Pétillon hopes to modernize and civilize the Congo in the most efficient and productive way possible."
congofla.19.a:0 "Perhaps now colonial incompetence will be a thing of the past."

congofla.20.t:0 "Reaping the Rewards of Piety"
congofla.20.d:0 "Governor Léon Pétillon is a Catholic first and a colonial leader second, for this pious child of God has always put his faith in the Lord above all other concerns and duties. Not one to be inconsistent, Pétillon has applied this near-zealous appreciation for his religion to his colonial policy and diplomacy with the Vrijstaat’s lieges. Drawing on ties and allies made during his time in Flanders-Wallonia, Governor Pétillon garnered a great deal of support, foreign aid, and other useful political tools. Coming from the Catholic Church itself as well as his allies in Wallonia’s largest Christian parties, this endless stream of support is instrumental in keeping Pétillon’s regime afloat and stable. Maintaining these ties is of the utmost importance to the Wallonian Technocrat, and he has even been known to shirk other colonial duties simply to appease these benefactors, leaving their influence on the Vrijstaat undeniable. Let us hope Governor Léon Pétillon does not become a puppet to these pious allies."
congofla.20.a:0 "A pious Congo is a stable Congo."

congofla.21.t:0 "The Belgo-Congolese Community"
congofla.21.d:0 "The crowning jewel of Governor Léon Pétillon’s efforts in the Vrijstaat is the idea of a ‘Communauté Belgo-Congolaise’, or Belgo-Congolese Community. An abstract concept more so than a set and single plan, this idea calls for a new order to overtake the Vrijstaat - one poised to take into account the needs and desires of both the African and Colonial populations equally and without bias. This ‘community’ would slowly endeavor to build a moderated and syncretic Congolese identity, formed from the two diverse halves that make up its whole, while simultaneously promoting a new equal standing among the Vrijstaat’s various ethnic and economic groups. Though fostering such a warm atmosphere of coexistence and cooperation shall be difficult to say the least in such a diverse and unruly colony, it is a necessity if the Vrijstaat is to survive. This evolution shall help transform this colony into a true modern nation-state, and Pétillon will lead us there!"
congofla.21.a:0 "Through cooperation and understanding, the Congo shall flourish!"

congofla.22.t:0 "The Prussian Eagle Soars Over the Congo"
congofla.22.d:0 "With von Epp’s ascension to the position of Governor-General of the Congo, the Prussian Eagle of the Kaiserreich has once again begun to soar across this vast jungle as it did during the Weltkrieg as our troops invaded its borders to fight off the Entente-aligned Belgian regime of old. With the Eagle’s return, ideas of Prussian Militarism and Germanic pride have begun to explode in popularity among the German colonials and their loyal Askari. To act on this growing wave of pro-German sentiment as well as the sudden influx of German military men, von Epp has enacted a mass militarization push across the colony, to finally bring the Vrijstaat’s military up to the standards of the Kaiserreich. Through new drills, training regimes, and even an entirely new officer class, the military of this colony shall come to exemplify the Prussian ideal as troops both green and veteran are imbued with this new spirit in newly constructed training camps across the nation. With this reaffirmed Prussia spirit, the Congo shall become a great bastion of German colonialism here at the heart of the Dark Continent, and the ruling regime shall be more secure than ever as more pro-German souls line up to defend their colony."
congofla.22.a:0 "We embrace the pride of Prussia and the legacy of Frederich the Great!"

congofla.23.t:0 "The Colonial Consolidation Act"
congofla.23.d:0 "In a shocking address to the entire Vrijstaat, Governor-General Franz Ritter von Epp has declared a nation-wide crackdown on native separatism and radicalism. Using the rising tide of Pan-Afrikanism, African Nationalism, and other dangerous ideas as an excuse to consolidate his grip over the colony, von Epp and his regime have begun to remove dozens of previously-honored native Congolese officials from office, replacing them with loyal Germans as they themselves are thrown into dark jails and prisons hidden throughout the Congo’s quagmire of jungles and swamps. Breaking many treaties and chiefly alliances along the way, von Epp has managed to anger most of the natives within the Congo, but with his renewed support from Berlin and the rising tide of Germanic militarism, the native Congolese can do little to stop von Epp and his ambitions."
congofla.23.a:0 "To preserve the colonial system, certain past privileges must be erased..."

congofla.24.t:0 "Rise of the ‘Koloniegaue’"
congofla.24.d:0 "To further consolidate his hold over the Congo, Franz Ritter von Epp has taken inspiration from the old pride of the Germanic race - the Holy Roman Empire. Copying and adapting the old Gau, or state, system, the Congo will be divided up into a bunch of semi-equal states and autonomies, each under the command of a loyal ally to the Kaiser’s Hand that shall answer only to von Epp and the Kaiser. These governors shall be drawn from von Epp’s allies in the NKR, his loyal generals and friends in the Force Publique, and even the occasional paramount chief or askari veteran that has proven their loyalty to the colonial system. This system of neo-feudalism shall work to better organize the Vrijstaat while delegating the great burden of administering this vast expanse. Though this new system shall take a while to fully set up, it has been a great first step on the road to a truly stable, truly German Congo."
congofla.24.a:0 "A new order, taking notes from an honored past."

congofla.25.t:0 "A New Südsiedlung"
congofla.25.d:0 "Modeled on the historic Ostsiedlung, or East Settling, that flooded thousands of Germans from the old Holy Roman Empire into their newly conquered lands of Eastern Europe, von Epp has called for a new mass immigration wave to the Congo, calling it the Neue Südsiedlung. This ‘South Settling’ is one part an attempt to rekindle the dying colonial spirit that once infested all of Germany and its loyal citizens, and one part mass immigration push aimed at displacing the current Flandro-Wallonian colonials and administrators with noble, loyal citizens of pure German stock. The Congo shall become like the Ostland colonies of the HRE or the Wild West of old America - a new, rugged frontier full of opportunity for those brave and cunning enough to seize it for themselves, and along the way, von Epp’s Congo shall increasingly be Germanized, only solidifying the regime of the Kaiser’s Hand."
congofla.25.a:0 "May this new wave of German settlement finally bring this land under the Kaiser’s control."

congofla.26.t:0 "Our Only True and Righteous National Institution"
congofla.26.d:0 "The Roman Catholic Church has long been a staple of our civilizing mission here in the Congo. Forming a third of the colonial trinity, it is no shock that we should grant them their rightful due. Be it the granting of vast swaths of land to use how they see fit, the sponsoring of missionary orders to bring the light of Our Blessed Lord to the entirety of the Congo, our lordship over the Congo has done more for the Church than any in history. With our sudden expansion of the Church's influence within the Congo, many have begun calling for the formal establishment of a Congolese Hierarchy. Since 1919, the Congo has been under an Apostolic vicariate based out of Leopoldville, a measure meant to only last until the local population has become significant Catholic to warrant the installment of a bishop. With our population now nearly half catholic, many feel the time has come to move forward, and create a series of Dioceses around the Congo.  While such a move is normally reserved for the Church,  due to our massive entanglement, we could in essence coerce the Church to establish these various dioceses. Of course such an action would undoubtedly cause a bit of strife, after all these dioceses would no doubt begin recruiting native bishops, an act that could start sprouting ideas of independence, an abhorrent idea to anyone within our administration. Regardless, the Church is no stronger than even within the Congo, and it will only be a matter of time until a native hierarchy is established, no matter our decision."
congofla.26.a:0 "The time is not yet ripe to end the vicariate."
congofla.26.b:0 "Vivat Christus Rex! The Congo is ready for her own hierarchy."

congofla.27.t:0 "Drag the Force Publique into Modernity"
congofla.27.d:0 "With the horrors of the Congo Crisis and the instability of the last few years behind us, it has become glaringly obvious that our military needs to be reformed and modernized if we are to continue to survive in this ever-changing world. Just last week, Governor [CON.getleader] took a tour of the local arsenal and military base located within the capital of Leopoldville. What was supposed to be a regular excursion for publicity turned into a full inventory search as the Governor was shocked to find that most of the capital’s arsenal - the main arsenal in the colony - was still largely stocked with antique museum pieces and relic weapons leftover from the Weltkrieg and before. This harsh realization has sent the Governor and his regime into a frenzy, starting a mass modernization effort across the Vrijstaat in order to bring the mighty Force Publique up to today’s standards. Though this effort will be quite expensive and take a while to fully finance and complete, it will be well worth it to ensure the Congo is secured and safe. As we erect these new factories, gunsmiths, military academies, training fields, weapons labs, and other facets of a contemporary military, we will know that our money is going to a worthy use."
congofla.27.a:0 "A modern and fierce fighting force fit for our Congo."

congofla.28.t:0 "The Legacy of the First Free State"
congofla.28.d:0 "Though the age of the first Free State is long behind us, that does not mean its legacy needs to die. The old order may have been brutal and archaic in its methods, but its raw efficiency, its level of stability, and the respect it commanded cannot be overlooked, and instead must be emulated! Leopold II was the greatest monarch the Belgian people have ever known, and we must look to this titan of imperialism as an example to match and even surpass if possible. We shall copy his techniques and the techniques of the colonial regime and Force Publique he once lorded over, modernizing them along the way so they can be folded into our doctrine and policy and implemented into the use in the Vrijstaat. We shall rekindle this lost colonialist spirit while making profits hand over fist, forging the current Vrijstaat into a refined and perfected form of its old self. We shall make the old king Leopold II proud, and we shall tame this wild Congo once and for all, bringing civilization and civility to this jungle quagmire through any means necessary."
congofla.28.a:0 "Sire, we will not mess it up this time, for the power is in our hands alone!"

congofla.29.t:0 "The Belgo-Congolese National Army"
congofla.29.d:0 "Though we emerged victorious from the recent calamities and chaos that consume our colony, we did not do so unscathed. The conflicts we now emerge from, we did so licking our wounds and thanking God for our hard-fought victory. The Force Publique, though it has served us well for decades, was humiliated on more than one occasion in the recent past, for their aging tactics and equipment revealed a major weakness in our doctrine. \n\nIn order to address these shortcomings, Governor-General [COG.getleader] has announced his intention to entirely reform the Force Publique, tearing down the old order and replacing it with a new, fully fleshed-out, and modernized national army. No longer shall the Vrijstaat be only protected by a mere security force. Our new armed forces shall apply the latest tactics and supplies from the homeland in Europe and use them to great effect against our enemies here on the Dark Continent. By empowering and expanding the White Officer class to control this ever-growing army and its unruly masses of African conscripts, we shall forge the soldiers of our Vrijstaat into an army to envy all Africa."
congofla.29.a:0 "From an antique security force to a modern masterpiece of combined arms."

congofla.30.t:0 "Colonial Self-Sufficiency No Matter the Cost"
congofla.30.d:0 "If our noble and free state is to make it anywhere in the world, we are going to need to have a modern and booming economy to fuel our ascent into modernity. Luckily for us, within the Congo there exists a company large and prosperous enough to finance this surge for self-sufficiency - the UMHK. Comprising just over 70% of our national economy, the UMHK is one of Africa’s largest companies, for no company moves as much ore and as much precious minerals as these industrious colonials. Composed of a mixed council of Belgian, Anglo, German, and even Dutch and French economists and business leaders, the UMHK’s Board of Directors is an imposing force to bargain with, but Governor-General [COG.getleader] is determined to make these corporatists bend. Through hard diplomacy, hostile business negotiations, and even through the threat of force from the Force Publique, our regime has made these captains of industry see the light, and with their aid, we shall build the Congo into a self-sustaining and free-standing new nation here in Africa."

In a grand meeting in the capital, Governor [COG.getleader] has worked tirelessly through days of debate and politicking in order to secure oaths of loyalty and support from the main paramount chiefs and prominent Congolese leaders. In exchange for sweeping reforms to Belgo-Congolese relations, increased autonomy and economic freedoms for most tribal kingdoms and protectorates, and other token concessions, these various Congolese groups have promised to provide men and supplies to the coming war effort. However, these small changes to the overall colonial relationship with the native Congolese was not the tipping point that allowed such a historic deal - for that, the colonials had to promise that the Congo as a whole would be granted self-rule under the colonial regime once and if Brussels was retaken, effectively making the Congo an equal, self-represented entity within the Belgian colonial empire. Though this compromise angered much of the Force Publique’s officer corps and military staff, as well as our more conservative colonial administrators, it was a necessary concession to ensure the support and loyalty of these much-needed native groups. Together, through gritted teeth and uneasy cooperation, we shall retake our homeland, and then we can reapproach this delicate situation."

Those who had survived the brutal raid woke to find their village in shambles, their compatriots and family members murdered, and the culprits nowhere to be found despite leaving taunting graffiti and plenty of evidence behind. This attack worryingly is not the first of its kind, for anti-German sentiment has been on the rise for weeks now with no end in sight, and though it does not seem the Belgian colonials are directly behind this wave of hate crimes and violence, they do not seem too keen on putting a complete stop to it, for less Germans admittedly makes their jobs easier as their main rivals no longer jockey with them for power. Worse still, it would seem many of these attacks are perpetrated by members of the Force Publique, further bloodying their hands and worsening their reputation with the people. We must be wary of this rising tide of racial unrest, and hope that it does not jeopardize our national stability."

Watching the vibrant Congolese sun setting over his new crop-filled fields and cattle-filled pastures, he sat with his wife as they talked over their day while he swigged from his drink and pulled smoke from his pipe heartily. Together, they surveyed the fruits of their hard labours just outside their quaint farmhouse on the savannah - a picturesque snapshot of the new Congolese arcadian idyll. \n\nNot being anyone special or unique, he and his family were just one of the hundreds of families, either German or Belgian in origin, that have made their way to the Vrijstaat in recent months in reaction to the colony’s new policy of renewed frontierism. Calling for a renewed settlement and colonization drive, the regime of Governor-General [COG.getleader] has moved to showcase the Congo as the perfect place for any seeking a fresh start. Incentivizing this settlement with land grants, seed funds, lowered tax rates, bundles of starting equipment - including tools, camping gear, hunting rifles, beasts of burden - and whatever else these new colonials would need, the government has poured everything it can spare to attract new European souls into the Vrijstaat. Those that do come are the heart of a new generation of colonial settlement in the Congo, reigniting the spirit that drove similar events such as the Scramble for Africa or America’s Manifest Destiny. Like their Wild West, the Congo has become Africa's new wild land of opportunity and danger, exciting and thrilling our countrymen both here and abroad, and attracting new thrill-seekers, gamblers, or even just those seeking a new life or a second chance, all for the benefit of our colony."

congofla.39.t:0 "A Pious Vrijstaat United By Faith"
congofla.39.d:0 "To say the Congo was without faith would be perhaps one of the most idiotic statements one could make. Be it the Catholicism of the Belgians and French, the Lutheranism of the Germans, or even the myriad faiths of the natives, be it pagan or syncretic, the people of the Congo are at their core a people of faith. With the recent conclusion of the civil war however, that faith has been greatly shaken in all but the most ardent believers. What kind of loving God or Gods would allow the evils, the horrors, the atrocities that followed in the wake of the civil war?\n\nThis question, and the reality of life in the post-war Congo has begun many to openly question their faiths, with some turning to agnosticism and in the worse cases, atheism. This poses two problems for us, the first being political in nature, the other more spiritual.  Politically speaking, atheism and agnosticism is dangerous in the fact that it calls the whole civilizing mission into question. While before we could vaguely justify our actions in terms of spreading both the Gospel and Western Civilization to these poor souls. If atheism were to become the norm, that justification is gone, and the nasty ideas of 'Freedom' and 'Independence' would no doubt spread like wildfire among the natives, perhaps allowing that demonic ideology of Syndicalism to spread to these primordial soils.. Should such an event take place, our rule would end quicker then it began. It was only due to their inexperience that the Kivu revolt failed, should it happen again, we would stand nearly no chance. On the spiritual side, atheism and growing agnosticism poses perhaps the largest threat to man's immortal soul. While sin is a horrible action that cuts man off from God, man can always return God viva repentance. For the atheist and agnostic however, the way back is much harder, and salvation is nigh impossible.\n\nWith these problems in mind, and in hopes of bringing unity that has been lost since the civil war, the Vrijstaat under [COG.GetLeader] has begun a series of programs to restore both trust in God and to bring deeper religious unity amongst the various groups that inhabit the Congo. While taking all forms and shapes, everything from missionary tours to easing religious restrictions, the most prominent of these programs is the so-called 'Light out of Darkness' program.  In essence, the program seeks to answer the question of why God allows evil to occur. Taking inspiration from both Catholic and Protestant sources, the program answers this question by stating it takes great pain for good to come about. Christ's passion was a horrid, bloody thing, but if it had not occurred man would not have been saved, and Christ would not have risen from the dead. So too must the Congo suffer a similar passion, but in the end after so much strife and horror, she will rise again, more glorious and powerful than before.\n\nWhile the programs are still in their infancy, unity among the various Christian groups within the Congo has never been higher, and it is predicted that in only a few years, the faith and morale of the Congolese will be higher than ever before."

The aging but sharp general entered the Kaiser’s chambers, where the old monarch sat upon his throne, surrounded by advisors clamoring for his attention and answers while servants waited quietly in the wings like mice, waiting for the Kaiser’s command to bring him what he desired. As the Kaiser's Hand approached the throne, which rested atop a small flight of stairs in the center of the chamber, hoisting the Kaiser above all those around him, the aging emperor surveyed the old, loyal general who now walked up to him. \n\nAnnouncing the death of the Mittlelafrikan project as the fires of the Collapse consume its dying carcass, von Epp swiftly bent the knee and began to swear his loyalty to the Kaiser and to Germany once more, as he had all those years ago when we was first knighted and honored by Willy himself. Kissing the ring of the Kaiser before finally rising, von Epp swore to his liege that so long as he himself still draws breath, there shall be no peace for the enemies of the Kaiser in Africa, and that from his new exile home in the Congo, von Epp would continue the Kaiser’s African ambitions, even if it’s the last thing he would do. With their meeting over, von Epp said farewell to his favored liege and embarked back on a trek back to Leopoldville, for the Kaiser’s Hand had much to do and prepare for.

Forsaking his Kaiser and his homeland, von Epp has announced that in the wake of Mittelafrika’s collapse, he is turning his back on the Kaiserreich for good. Instead, von Epp seeks to chase his own desires and ambitions within his new fiefdom in the Congo, fully renouncing his oath of loyalty to the German Crown. \n\n Finally done reading, the Kaiser was sent into a blind rage, practically frothing at the mouth in a deranged tantrum over the loss of not only one of the Kaiserreich’s most important colonial possessions, but also over the loss of one of his most favored generals and one of his oldest friends. Collapsing to the floor exhausted, the Kaiser fixed himself and his attire, and began to exclaim wildly that Africa was not lost and that the Kaiserreich would last a thousand years or more - ravings of madman backed into a corner and forced to face the crumbling reality around him.

The exact details of von Epp's meeting with His Holiness are unknown, but it is believed the Archchancellor sought his blessing for his attempts to revive the Holy Roman Empire on the African continent. While we can't be certain, just two short days after the meeting, the Successor of Saint Peter announced his complete and total support for von Epp's crusade, asking any and all faithful Catholics who could, to make their way to von Epp's Congo, and aid him on his journey. Further, the Bishop of Rome granted to the future Holy African Emperor the title of King of the Romans, a title once held by the Holy Roman Emperors of old.

Taking heavy inspiration from the ancient coronations of the Holy Roman Emperors, both Roman and German, the coronation is too a fairly simple affair. Following the Liturgy of the Word but before the Liturgy of the Eucharist, Patriarch Scalais is to preform the rite. The Rite starts by the asking of six simple questions; Will he defend the holy faith, will he defend the Holy Church, will he defend the realm, will he maintain the laws of the Empire, will he maintain justice? and will he show due submission to the Pope? If the Emperor-elect responses in the affirmative to all, with his hand on the Altar of God, the Patriarch shall anoint him with Holy Oil and prayer for and over him. Following this, the Emperor shall be invested in the royal regalia, and at last the crown of the Holy African Empire shall be placed on his head, confirming his role and granting him the sole legal right to rule these lands, for God and Nation.\n\nThe Imperial Regalia to be used in the actual rite is mostly of European origin, most coming from the old Holy Roman regalia, held in Austrian treasuries by the Hapsburgs, whom sent them as gifts following the Pope's total endorsement of the Empire. The largest exception of this is the actual crown of the Emperor of all Africans. The crown itself has been forged from elements all throughout the realm. The Cross at the top of the crown is made from the melted down spears that belonged to loyal Askari chiefs, while the detailed base has been forged from a mix of bras from force publique soliders and melted shackles from the era of Leopold's tyranny. As for the varied jewels that decorate the crown and give it color, they come from various miners who donated them on behalf of the Union Minere de Haut-Katanga  The helm of the crown, a small golden thing send and blessed by the Pope himself, is the sole part to not be from Africa.\n\nWith the Coronation of the Emperor, our goals here on the Dark Continent are nearly complete, thanks be to God.

Modeled on the historic HRE, this new empire rises over the ashes of the old Mittelafrikan order, seeking to bring prosperity, culture, tradition, and respect to the various peoples and colonial remnants of Africa. \n\nRejecting European ties fully, Erzkanzler von Epp seeks to forge this HAR into a formidable and respected new empire free from the sins and failures of the old monarchs and republics that have failed the modern West. Forming a new Imperial Diet and breaking the lands of our former-colony into new Reichsgau, or imperial states, the political and social landscape of Africa shall slowly move to emulate the old HRE’s order.

This atmosphere of neo-feudalism mixed with pious adherence to Catholicism, a reforged colonial economic system based on rampant mercantilism, and a resurging martial emphasis,  has coalesced into one of the most bizarre and unique political entities on the planet. As if he had just taken pages from history and applied them to a modern setting, Erzkanzler von Epp has created an insane fusion of European tradition and elective monarchism with imperialist policy and colonial economics.

An impenetrable redoubt at the core of Africa, the Congo colony is no longer the verdant and tropical wildscape many have come to view it as, for the green flora and blue skies have been replaced by grey concrete and black smog. The nation’s open fields, savannahs, and rolling hills are covered in Weltkrieg-style trench systems and bunkers while the mountains are peaked with watchtowers and fortresses, always aiming artillery batteries and anti-air guns in an unending watch. Dams and river outposts along the Congo bristle with guns and defences, serving as relay stations and strongpoints for ever-patrolling rivercraft crewed by elite marines. Even the jungles have not been left untouched, with thousands of square miles of forest being filled with booby-traps like pitfalls and swinging-log traps, turning the primordial wilderness into a hellscape where even a single wrong step can mean instant and violent death. Under von Epp, this Dreadfort has become infamous across the Dark Continent and the wider world as one of the most well-defended and impossible-to-invade areas on Earth, and from within the fortress-city of ‘Neue-Wilhelmsburg,’ or what was once Leopoldville, von Epp commands this living, breathing, nation-wide fortification with unyielding vigilance and attention to detail. Not a single inch of border goes unpatrolled, and not one meter of our colony is not fortified or modified for defence in some way.

The Vrijstaat has been bled dry and worked to the bone to carry us home, and now many, even among those within our own government, believe it is time to grant the Congolese their due. Though granting them self-rule would not mean independence, they would still be given a greater deal of autonomy than the modern colony has ever had, allowing it to function as a virtually independent state as long as it followed the economic whims and foreign policy plans of Brussels.

More then that however, the Pope declared that the same man who was to be Archbishop of Leopoldville was to be the Latin Patriarch of Africa, nominal head of the entire African Church. This Latin Patriarchate of Africa, a move that has been decried by almost all sides within the Church, has become the 11th such Patriarchate within the Latin Rite of the Church. In practicality, this title will have very little effect on the actual governance of the Church within Africa, as all Bishops will still answer directly to the Pope in Rome.\n\nFuthermore, the Pope has announced that Félix Scalais, current Apostolic Vicar of the Congo, is to be invested as the first Archbishop of Leopoldville, and thus Patriarch of Africa.

Even with the advent of colonialism, and the spreading of Gospel and growth of the One True Church to much of the Dark Continent, these customs have survived, and in many ways have even thrived, by way of syncretism. Mixing and muddling the beauty of Christianity with their fowl pagan practices, many so-called 'African' churches have sprung up since the carriers of the True Gospel first landed on these fair shores. Spreading their paganism among the people, these heretics have done nothing but endanger the immortal soul of everyone who hears their poisoned gospel. The reason why this heresy has spread so far is quite obvious, especially to the hardened missionary; it maintains the traditions the natives have held since time immemorial.\n\nTo help solve this most pressing of issues, a group of priests, headed by newly ordained Father Joseph Malula, have proposed a radical solution to this predicament. This group of priests has suggested the introduction of what they are calling the 'Zaire Use', a heavily modified version of the normal Latin Mass, that they claim will be able to turn the tide against the growth of 'Africanized' Christianity. In short, the Zaire Use would see the use of traditional African music, dance and even vestments within the Mass. Most radical of all, the Mass would not be prayed in Latin, but in the language of the people, be it Kituba, Lingala, Swahili or Tshiluba.\n\nWhile obviously a radical change in course from our historical strictness with the use of the Latin Rite, such a change would surly be boon to our attempts to bring the One True Faith to the Congo.

Far too many photographers lack the eye for true humanity that is so often required to compose a great shot, but the famed Casimir Zagourski has no such issue or lack of skill. \n\nBorn into the Clan of Ostoja - a Polish knightley nobles - Casimir Zagourski - then Kazimierz Zagórski, served in the Imperial Russian air force before fleeing the nation as the Reds rose in 1917. Though the Reds failed, Zagourski did not return to his homeland, and instead moved to Leopoldville in 1924, gallicizing his name upon arrival and opening up his own film studio. \n\nAs a photographer, Zagourski travelled all around Africa on numerous treks and safaris as he photographed native peoples by the thousands. \n\nHoping to showcase Africa’s ‘disappearing’ natives, who he and many other anthropologists and chroniclers felt were going extinct and having their unique cultures erased under the pressures of colonial rule. Now an older man, having finished his last major excursion in 1937 which saw him out in the field for months on end, Zagourski has compiled all of his albums and best photos into a single, collective exhibition he has dubbed ‘L'Afrique qui Disparaît’, or ‘The Africa that is Disappearing.’ Showing off both cultural beauty and the horrors of colonialism, this exhibition has set fire to the worlds of art, anthropology, and colonial administration, shocking and enlightening curious minds across the world."

However, all must perish - event titans and stars as illustrious as he - and Zagourski is no different. Surrounded by loved ones and some of his close friends and allies he had picked up during his time on safari deep in the heart of Africa, Casimir Ostoja Zagourski gave up the ghost last night in his sleep at the tender age of 61 after a long bout with failing health spurred on by the heat and disease of the Bush. Famed for his photographic exhibition ‘L'Afrique qui Disparaît’ that both shocked and thrilled the world with uncensored depictions of both vibrant African cultures and brutal colonial oppression and neglect, Zagoruski is regarded as one of the best photographers of his generation. With his passing, the nation mourns, as do the millions of people whose hearts and minds he touched with both his photos and with his genuine love and respect for all of Africa’s diverse peoples."

The interconnected patchwork of tribal chiefdoms, protectorates, and colonial holdings has seemingly deteriorated overnight, and darkness reigns across Afrika. Within our own borders, various seperatist movements have taken the opportunity to revolt against our rightful rule! To the north in Coquilhatville, a mercenary state rises to oppose our rule, while to the east, the Kivu Clique and the native Congolese seek to throw off the shackles of colonialism. Seizing on this moment of weakness, Leopoldsville to the west has seceded, taking our only sea access with them, while the Miners Union of the south jungles have declared autonomy from our administration to further their own interests.

conbel.2.d:0 "Bunkeya, the faltering jewel of the Garanganze people, lies nestled deep within the Congo-Vrijstaat's southern jungles. Once a bustling center of trade and culture during the reign of the Yeke Kingdom, Bunkeya has long since stagnated in its fall from prosperity. The rule of the joint Flandro-Wallonian-German mission has cast a dark cloud over the colony. Though these Europeans brought the light of civilization, with all of its accompanying technologies and accouterments, they have also brought death and decay. The colony and its native people are overworked by its overseers who use the natives as cheap labor, harvesting the vast natural and mineral riches of the Congo. Though this system has created vast amounts of material wealth for the Flandro-Wallonians, and for Mitteleuropa as a whole, it has also drawn the ire of many natives in the colony. Most prominent among the dissidents of the colonial regime is the Mwami and his loyal followers. The Mwami is the local, rightful ruler to these lands in the eyes of the natives, and his insurrectionary activities continue to be a thorn in the side of our administration and threaten the very stability of our stake here. Before it is too late, a direction must be chosen if the colony is to survive. Whether we crush the Mwami or decide to tolerate their existence, we must be certain it is the correct path. Despite the growing dark clouds on the horizon, both here in the colony and back home on the European mainland, our colonial government must steer itself on a direct and measured course if it is to survive the coming storm."

For months, Pierre Ryckmans and his administration have fought tooth and nail with the Mwami of the southern Congo in Garanganze. Time and time again, peace talks have almost succeeded, only for such hopes to be dashed by another rise in violent conflict: the region has not known peace or stability for what feels like ages.

Functioning as a sort of "middle-class" in the colony, the Évolues complete vital functions key to keeping the colony running, from fields such as nursing to engineering. In recognition of their great and patriotic service to the Flanders-Wallonian colonial empire, the Évolues of the Congo colony have finally been awarded for their long and unwavering service. Their reward shall take the form of better housing, better pay, and greater freedoms and rights within the colony. They will also be granted representatives in the colonial congress who, while holding no voting power, can act as observers so the native voice can at least be heard in colonial meetings.

conbel.7.d:0 "It seems that with the collapse of Mittelafrika, the various forces across the Congo that have long undermined our rule have taken this moment of chaos and weakness to declare their independence from the main Vrijstaat. Among these various break-off groups, and perhaps most surprisingly, it seems that the mining concerns of the UMHK and their lobbyists and cronies in the capital have risen up in Katanga and declared our current government dead, with the Force Publique garrison in the capital of Leopoldville doing the same, citing our regime’s weakness and inaction. These rebels claim the current administration has kowtowed to the whims of natives and non-important groups for too long, restraining the colonial dream and its basal goals. The UMHK have seized parts of Elisabethville as well as their mining and harvesting operations across the colony and refuse to deescalate the situation while the FP have seized control of the capital and the rest of Bas-Congo, taking the vital port of Matadi with them. \n\nIn response, our cabinet has come up with two possible solutions to our problems. The first option is to simply do nothing and let these rebels continue their operations in peace, with proponents for this plan claiming tensions will cool in the coming weeks and that direct military action would be too hasty or drastic, for these are our colonial brothers, and to fire on them would be madness. Alternatively, the main opposition to this plan is to ride out and crush this insurrection now before it can grow out of hand. The debate raged far into the next morning but by the end of the conference, a clear victor stood among the factions."

While moving towards reconstruction, the question of our international alignment has come up numerous times, and many in our administration feel that we will need allies in order to maintain order and security.

With faith in Ryckmans’ regime faltering with each misstep in policy or each new native riot that breaks out, many within the colonial administration and settler population wish to wipe clean the current administration and replace it with a more competent one. However, Ryckmans has long stood as a stalwart defender of Congolese interests over favoring either Berlin or Brussels, and if he were to be voted out, the Vrijstaat would likely greatly swing towards one of these two benefactors for aid and legitimacy. \n\nTo replace Ryckmans stands two main alternatives, each pursuing their own agendas. Fighting for increased German interests and control in the Congo is the famed Franz Ritter von Epp, hero of the Weltkrieg and Knight of the German Empire. Under his rule, the Vrijstaat would work towards closer cooperation and even possible full integration into the wider Mittelafrikan patchwork itself, giving the Kaiserreich full access to the Congo’s riches. Alternatively, the Flandro-Wallonian candidate is someone far less controversial than this Kraut - the Force Publique commander Léo Pétillon. Pétillon stands as a staunch pro-Flandro-Wallonian nationalist and minor technocrat - the perfect scion to unleash upon this unruly colony.

At the head of this vile imperialist serpent is the infamous Franz Ritter von Epp, the Kaiser’s highest official in the Vrijstaat, who has ruled over the Congo since Governor-General Ryckmans was replaced. Despite his power, prestige, and links to the German Empire, von Epp has still been increasingly pushed back as his influence and power wanes in this atmosphere of rising chaos and violence. The Congo has reached a fever pitch of anti-German sentiment, and now even the dark, twisting jungles can’t hide these Krauts now.

The foolish Flandro-Wallonians could not hope to handle this chaos-filled primordial paradise, and as such they have lost their mandate to rule over the Congo to our more able administration. \n\n However, with the Epp regime now thoroughly cemented in their position as the new hegemons of the Congo, a final choice on the future of this Eden must be made. Long has this region been a hotbed for separatism, anti-colonialism, and general unrest between both the various native groups and the colonists themselves. To disrupt this carefully-balanced status quo would be suicide to our new regime, or at least many of our more cautious ministers and generals feel so, and so we coulld heed their warnings and merely continue the rule of the old Congo Colony under a the new moniker of the Kongo Freistaat, reserving our autonomy and nominally still accepting the co-rule of our Flandro-Wallonian allies. Alternatively, the far more fervent loyalists, diehard monarchists, and other dedicated ministers within our camp instead seek to go with an opposite approach. These loyalists instead hope to merge the Congo into the wider Mittelafrikan megacolony, integrating Leopoldville directly with Dar-Es-Salaam, and fully uniting the central expanse of Africa under the Iron Cross of the Kaiserreich. \n\nDistinct from these two options however exists a third camp, championed by von Epp himself, who instead seek a middle-ground option. Seeking to cast-off the shared rule of the Flandro-Wallonians, who have proven all to clearly to be poor colonial leaders and incapable of ruling over the Congo, and to instead create a new, purely Afro-German state at the center of this Dark Continent to serve as the new, Germanized crown jewel of the Kaiser’s African ambitions. Under this plan, von Epp would rise as the new Staathalter of a unified and autonomous Deutscher Zentralafrikanischer Staat, finally freeing the Congo from the shackles of lesser rulers and races, and introducing the full might of German culture and governance to these lands while keeping a separate and distinct identity from wider Mittelafrika. Whatever the choice may be, the future of the Congo shall be dictated by the Kaiser as the Dark Heart of Africa falls sway under the Iron Eagle of the Reich."

With these hordes of Huns, Epp seeks to entirely wipe away the last administration that was run by Ryckmans, for Epp sees Ryckamans and his lackeys as nothing but a pack of soft-handed fools unfit for the rigours of colonial duty. As his replacements come in, the Congo shall be increasingly Germanized, bringing with them the ideas of Prussian militarism and pride and German excellence to this wild frontier.

conbel.22.d:0 "Hans Otto Georg Hermann Fegelein has long been a fixture in von Epp’s entourage, serving with the honored commander since his own induction into the German Colonial Service. Despite opportunistically serving under one of the most respected officers in the Kaiserreich however, Fegelein is far from the model soldier von Epp trained him to be. \n\nFegelein’s career in the Mittelafrikan colonies has been mired by one controversy and disciplinary hearing after another, each one more nutritious than the last. From overly harsh punishments towards his own soldiers to committing wholesale slaughter of French and African civilians in the swamps of the Congo, Fegelein has committed more acts of cruelty against both colonials and Africans than most, and yet he still remains in his high position. Fegelein, despite his many flaws and deranged pleasures, is admittedly an efficient, if excessively brutal, colonial administrator and quite the effective military commander to boot, and his usefulness tied with the general aloofness of the Mittelafrikan regime has kept him from being court martialed. \n\nFegelein’s most recent exploit to receive widespread attention and ire from his superiors has caused quite the political quagmire. It seems that after a long weekend of drinking local spirits, chewing khat, and smoking opium with his gang of rough riders and savage soldiers, Fegelein and his crew got into a scuffle with some local African tribals. Getting into a confrontation outside a local biergarten, Fegelein and his men began to harass a group of tribals with racial remarks that soon escalated into physical violence. After beating the Africans senseless and making off with some of their valuables, Fegelein’s posse was chased down by both colonial officers and armed Askari. It would seem that the group of Africans they assaulted and mugged were of royal blood, being the kin of a local Baluba paramount chief that has long been loyal to German rule and particularly to von Epp. To give off the facade of accountability, the colonial officials arrested Fegelein and his men, forcing them to give back the various trinkets and cash stolen from these royals. However, the situation has since spiraled into a minor diplomatic crisis between the German administration and the local chiefs, and von Epp is now up to his neck in bureaucratic annoyances and diplomatic posturing, much to his chagrin. As a result, Fegelhein has been temporarily jailed to maintain some goodwill with the Baluba while this blows over, though his ‘cell’ is more like a quaint and spacious apartment. However, a few of his men did not fare so well, and have been offered up to higher sentences and punishments as a scapegoat for Fegelein - a fact hidden from the Baluba delegation. \n\nSoon, this shall all blow over as von Epp diligently and expertly handles the situation, but many wonder how many times Fegelein can escape true punishment for his misdeeds."

Despite his scandalous social reputation and fascination with the controversial Völkisch movement, Röhm has been protected by von Epp due to his loyalty and unmatched skill as an officer, with a deep but professional friendship developing between them for decades as a result. Though Röhm spends much of his free time amidst the seedy nightscene of the capital, he is always ready for duty each morning as dictated by the all-powerful von Epp. Lacking aspirations to rule of his own, Röhm diligently follows his fellow Bavarian as they seek to mold the Dark Heart of Afrika to their own whims."

Now thoroughly in charge of the Congo, von Epp must make a choice on where to take this reacquired jewel of Afrika. Sure, von Epp has sworn a lifelong duty to the Kaiser and the German Empire, but the failings of this now-dying empire are as clear as day, and have left von Epp shaken, with his loyalties falling into question. Before this catastrophe, it would have been no choice or even thought for von Epp to immediately send communications to Berlin, reaffirming his loyalty to the Crown and notifying the Kaiser that the Congo was once again thoroughly in German hands, and this is still a choice that lies before the infamous ‘Kaiser’s Hand.’ If he were to bend the knee to Berlin once more, he could choose to accept reality and merely reinforce the Congo, or even go on some grand crusade to reconquer the lands of Mittelafrika and restore the old colonial order. Such decisions would earn him great honors and rewards from the Kaiser and his countrymen, but such a victory pales in comparison to the glories that await von Epp should he turn his back on this decaying imperialist power and instead blaze a new path forth atop his own ambitions. Denying the faltering light of the Kaiser, von Epp could stride forth and retake the lands of Mittelafrika for himself and for his loyal allies and fellow colonials who have proven themselves in Afrika - the world’s last great frontier! The choice is up to von Epp of course, but what shall he choose - to rekindle a dying empire, to accept the grim reality of post-Collapse Afrika, or deny both these paths to chase his destiny and former Germanic glories for the good of all Germans left on the Dark Continent?"

Though the trek was long and fraught with danger, with numerous guerilla forces assaulting von Epp’s convoy along the way, von Epp finally arrived in Leopoldville, where he was greeted with a city consumed in inferno and racial violence as the remaining colonials, both Belgian and German, fought back against the rising Congolese tide. With von Epp and his veterans joining the fray, the Europeans were able to turn the tide and cleanse the city of separatists, securing von Epp’s hold over the city. Now, with his rule consolidated, von Epp has begun to send patrols and squads into the jungles to slowly take back his new domain. Though the local Flandro-Wallonians may not be fully happy under the yoke of the Germans once more, their united front is their only hope at survival."

conbel.26.t:0 "Flandro-Wallonians Furious Over the von Epp Regime’s Return"
conbel.26.d:0 "With the arrival of Franz Ritter von Epp and his German reinforcements, the Flandro-Wallonian remnants have begun to vocally exclaim their opposition to von Epp’s new government while moving to mobilize their attachments of the Congo’s colonial military. Sengier and his UMHK, along with the remaining forces of the Force Publique and any other remaining Belgian colonials not already in the German camp, have pushed back on von Epp’s attempts at complete dominance, and now speak of war. Stating that the Collapse is no cause for a complete reshuffling of the colonial hierarchy, the Flandro-Wallonian colonials argue that such a mass shift would only cause more chaos and degradation to the fragile imperialist remnant. Despite von Epp’s ambitions, he will have to face these Belgians in battle, for they do not seem keen at bending the knee to his will or the Kaiser’s." 
conbel.26.a:0 "To arms, for it seems we will have to fight for our claim to the Congo."

conbel.27.t:0 "The New Collegium Electorale of the Congo"
conbel.27.d:0 "With the consolidation of von Epp’s regime in the Congo, our great and honorable leader has declared his intention to name the new Prince-Electors of the Congo, creating a new Electoral College to eventually vote on a new Emperor for our growing empire. With many loyalists and allies, both old and new, clamoring for a position, von Epp has had to make hard decisions and shrewd checks of loyalty, for not only does each Elector get a vote, but also a piece of the Congo now, and if their plan is successful a piece of Mittelafrika later. \n\nAfter a long and thorough period of contemplation, von Epp named his initial list of Prince-Electors, though more would eventually need to be named if their reconquest of Africa proved successful. \n\nDrawing from all corners of the Congolese political atmosphere, von Epp has assembled a colorful and diverse cast of loyalists to his cause. From the remnants of the NKR, the likes of Hermann Fegelein, Kai-Uwe von Hassel, Josef Terboven, and many others have been made new Princes, as have local native allies such as Alexander Duala Manga Bell, Moïse Tshombe, Daniel Kanza, and the Mwami of Katanga, along with many other loyal Askari generals and Paramount Chiefs. Not stopping there, von Epp also named a few Force Publique veterans such as Armand Huyghé and Émille Janssens. Not stopping with his homage to the Holy Roman Empire there, von Epp has also announced that certain cities like Elisabethville and Matadi would become Free Cities, led by prominent economic figures in the Congo like Edgar Sengier and Jules Cousins. Taking it further, new Catholic Bishoprics and Diocese have been erected by favored priests and holy figures, as well as the likes of devout colonial missionaries such as Diedrich Hermann Westermann. These new members of the Imperial Electoral College of Africa shall aid Franz Ritter von Epp in his goals to bring civilization and Catholicism to the great and varied peoples of Africa, serving as a beacon of stability and modernity. More importantly, these honored souls will soon cast their vote to decide the first Emperor of our new Congo-borne African empire."
conbel.27.a:0 "May these new ‘Große des Reiches’ do von Epp proud!"

conbel.28.t:0 "Electing our New Holy African Emperor"
conbel.28.d:0 "With the Prince-Electors gathered in Leopoldville and the foundations of our new administration set, Chief Elector Franz Ritter von Epp has called for a new imperial diet to be held so that the first emperor of our new Reich can be chosen. Before this newly-assembled council lay the names of many men who this group may crown, but only one can be emperor, and much debate and thought must go into this decision. Once elected, our new emperor shall become the public facade of our nation - a beacon of stability, tradition, and piety - as von Epp still continues to truly run the nation and its military from the shadows. \n\nWith preparations finished, the chambers to the new imperial senate, built on the grounds of the old colonial office in Leopoldville, buzzed to life with anxiety and expectation as the long and arduous voting process began. Though many, many names have been put forward by the various ex-colonials, paramount chiefs, Bishops, NKR loyalists, and other allies of von Epp, only a few stand any real shot at winning. The most obvious choice to many, and to von Epp himself, is to elect the honorable King of Bavaria Rupprecht, whose experience already as a monarch and as a friend of von Epp make him the perfect candidate. In opposition to this, a small group of Belgian ex-colonials and remnants from the Force Publique and UMHK have instead floated the name of the young Prince Badouin, the infantile son of Leopold III, son of Albert, of Flanders-Wallonia, who would likely prove to be easy to control due to his young age and inexperience. \n\nWith these royals already accounted for, that leaves the less likely but still prominent candidates in the running. The various native interest groups and paramount chiefs-turned-electors seek to crown devoted Kamerunian monarchist and German loyalist Alexander Duala Manga Bell while von Epp’s loyalists in the NKR have begun to float names like Hermann Fegelein, von Epp’s right-hand man, as a possible candidate. Meanwhile, some have even been calling for von Epp to simply be crowned himself, for only he has proven his skill and gaul as he moves to retake all of German Africa. \n\nThough who sits on the throne shall matter for little aside from public image and legitimacy, this election is still monumentally important, for it shall dictate who will become the face of our new Holy African Empire. With our new emperor on the throne and von Epp at the helm of the state and the military, our ambitions here will not merely die in the Congo’s jungles and swamps, for whoever sits on that throne shall be the beacon that illuminates the way to our destiny!"
conbel.28.a:0 "Rupprecht of Bavaria is the obvious and most legitimate choice."
conbel.28.c:0 "There is one man fit for this throne, and it is von Epp himself!"
conbel.28.b:0 "To appease the natives, Alexander Duala Manga Bell shall be crowned."
conbel.28.e:0 "To appease the Belgians, the young Prince Baudouin shall be crowned."

conbel.29.t:0 "The Iron Eagle Flies Home"
conbel.29.d:0 "Deep within the city-spanning palatial-fortress that had become Leopoldville as the polluted acid-rain caused by the factories nearby spattered on the concrete that had enveloped the area, Staathalter of Zentralafrika Franz Ritter von Epp quietly stared out the nearest window. Looking over the lands he was ordered by some far-off Kaiser to administer and govern, von Epp felt no pride or sense of accomplishment, no joy or gratification; all he felt was boredom. The Congo, with all its secrets and riches, had begun to bore the old veteran, for von Epp was always a man of action, a man of war, and sitting idly in a neutral and self-sufficient colony brought him nothing but tedium. Dreaming of new conquests and of new sights, new glories for both himself and his beloved Fatherland, von Epp breathed his last few breaths of Congolese air as he stood up from his desk and began to walk down to his car, where his driver awaited to ferry him to the nearest airstrip. Leaving this hazy, rainy, tropical quagmire, von Epp prepared to return home to Berlin in order to once again join the true fight. In his stead, his loyal lackey and right-hand man, the infamous nationalist Ernst Julius Günther Röhm, shall take his place as the Staathalter of Zentralafrika. Perhaps this rising officer can make a better time for himself in this eden than von Epp ever could."
conbel.29.a:0 "Hopefully he left this paradise in capable hands."

conbel.30.t:0 "A Helping Hand"
conbel.30.d:0 "Since the end of the Congo Civil War a short time ago, the nation has finally begun to return to some kind of normality, at least in some sectors. All around, this primeval Eden still burns, and chaos still reigns. Be it viruses running rampant, poverty stricken families fleeing to the cities in hopes of finding scraps, or the various wildfires lit during fighting still burning, the nation is nowhere close to truly being free of conflict. Even during this chaos, it seems our people are not without aid. Be it the International Red Cross, the Salvation Army or any number of other charity groups, Christian or otherwise, have all converged on the Congo following the civil war to aid in reconstruction. While their aid cannot hope to steam the tide by itself, the very presence of these groups gives hope to our people. Hope, that in the future, the Congo will be rebuild, hope that the chaos will end, hope that normality will prevail."

conbel.31.t:0 "Röhm’s Regime"
conbel.31.d:0 "With Ernst Julius Günther Röhm now serving as the Staathalter of Zentralafrika, and with his initial duties from the administrative change now finally finishing up, it is finally time to decide on a future direction for the Congo. Long an ally, friend, and underling of von Epp, Röhm has been a dedicated member of the Neue Kolonialregierung for years. However, with his old superior now gone back to Berlin, if Röhm were to ever blaze his own path ahead, now would be the time. Long tinkering with ideas of German Nationalism, Paganism, racial supremacism, and Right-wing Populism, Röhm could put these ideas to the test here in our eden, creating the Kongolesische Vaterlandspartei to form the official and organized foundation of his new ideology and regime. However, such a change would not be viewed too kindly by von Epp or our colonial masters, not to mention how the millions of Congolese locals would react. Perhaps it is best to just stick with von Epp’s status quo established by the NKR."
conbel.31.a:0 "We shall forever heed the word of von Epp. Stay with the NKR."
conbel.31.b:0 "It is time for Röhm and Congolese Völkism to rise. Heil the KVP!"

conbel.32.t:0 "The New Staathalter’s Secret"
conbel.32.d:0 "Staathaler Röhm rules with an iron fist, holds German Nationalism and racial supremacist ideas in his heart, and is as ruthless and as veteran as any German veteran of the Weltkrieg. He serves with honor and rules without remorse or mercy, but there is one secret soft-spot the Staathalter possesses. Hidden away from the public eye and outside of the limelight, Röhm frequents bars and brothels in the darkest hours of the night, meeting friendly guests and enjoying himself as any man of power is known to do. \n\nHowever, it is said that it is not the beautiful and exotic women of the Dark Continent that Röhm wants, or even the whitest ewes of the colonialist centers, for Röhm prefers the company of a more masculine kind. Keeping it hidden in order to preserve his strongman image and his credibility among his Völkist cronies, no matter how hard he tries to hide it, there are always whispers. Even now, all across the colony, gossiping wives and whispering workers shared hushed tones over Röhm’s nocturnal escapades, only infuriating our new Staathalter. Perhaps he should try harder to keep his secrets if they are so damaging to his image."
conbel.32.a:0 "Scandalous!"

conbel.33.t:0 "Public Reaction to the KVP"
conbel.33.d:0 "As Staathalter Röhm has moved to organize his new KVP, the local Congolese have only met this news with outrage. Furious over the Germans trying to establish a colonial regime reminiscent of the barbarity shown at the hands of Leopold or worse, Congolese citizens and native members of the Force Publique have begun to riot throughout the colony. Though these pockets of rabble will prove to be no match against the might of the full German war machine, they still have done their damage, and it will be sometime until the colony is stable and at peace enough for Staathalter Röhm to carry on with his Völkist dream."

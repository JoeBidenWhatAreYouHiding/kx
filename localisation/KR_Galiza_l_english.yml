### Focuses ###
GLC_focus:0 "Galician Focus Tree"

GLC_Liberty:0 "Nós, Nomeámonos!" 
GLC_Liberty_desc:0 "The fledgling Galician nationalism, long obscured in the shadow of its more prominent cousins in Catalonia and Basque Country, has finally had its unexpected fulfillment. With the support of Basque and Catalan militias, the Galician patriots have seized control of the wayward region, forcing the Ferrol garrison to surrender. Already, exiled Galician nationalists from the New World are making their way to our shores to join the fray, and for the first time ever since the independent Galician realms, this Atlantic province of Spain is free. The war against Spain looms in the horizon, but loyal sons of Galicia are prepared to defend their newfound libery to the end."

GLC_A_Corunan_Factories:0 "The Crown of Atlantic Coast"
GLC_A_Corunan_Factories_desc:0 "A Coruña, the crown of Atlantic, is hardly the industrial giant of Iberia, but even this backwards region has some semblance of industry. While limited in scope to consumer goods, civilian hardware and textiles, it is nonetheless capable of supplying some equipment and necessary goods for our rebellion against the Spanish regime. Similarly, whatever material can be scrounged up from the Ferrol garrison and dockyards for military use will be immediately shipped to the militia units of our provisional army, so that they do not need to go into battle armed with shovels and pitchforks."

GLC_Batallon_Literario:0 "Raising a New Batallón Literario"
GLC_Batallon_Literario_desc:0 "Batallón Literario is a military unit type native to Galicia, that has existed in one form or another since the mid-1600s, though the most notable iteration of this venerable martial tradition was the one formed in 1808 to fight against the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte. It is usually made up of students and faculty members of the university of Galicia, and the new Batallón Literario will take a similar shape of volunteers. While these men will hardly be more experienced or trained than those of their militia counterparts, it is hoped that their nationalism for Galicia propels them into battle with great fervour, and that through their education, they may be able to become the officers and commanders of the future Galician national army."

GLC_Summon_Our_Celtic_Brothers:0 "Our Brothers at the End of the Earth"
GLC_Summon_Our_Celtic_Brothers_desc:0 "Galicia is one of the most debated regions of Iberia in its origins, as Galicians are often considered to be Celtic in origin, and while the language they speak is not Celtic indeed, we do share the heritage rather proudly alongside our Portuguese brothers. As such, the Lusitanian regime, while not particularly interested in the republicanism and love of democracy that the Galicians espouse, is nonetheless likely to assist us out of sheer support for their formerly Celtic brethren and the bond that our small province shares with the Portuguese as the most Atlantic lands of Iberia."

GLC_Bring_the_Diaspora_Home:0 "The Cuban Diaspora Returns Home!"
GLC_Bring_the_Diaspora_Home_desc:0 "When the Second Republic was squashed, many Galicians fled Spain out fear for military repressions, especially those who had been active in Galicianist sectors. However, now that the rebellion is in full swing and the Spanish control over the peninsula is fading, Galicians from all over the globe are returning to their homeland en masse, eager to take up arms for the liberation of their beloved province. Most are coming from the island of Cuba, where large quantities of Galicians fled to even during the Primo de Rivera era, and where they formed communities of Galicians yearning for a liberated homeland. With their help, the ranks of Galician militias are swelling to untold heights."

GLC_Disarm_Guardia_Civil:0 "Wrest Guardias Out of Spanish Control"
GLC_Disarm_Guardia_Civil_desc:0 "Many Guardia Civil officers here in Galicia support the Madrid regime, but there are also a lot of those who yearn back to the freedom that was promised during the republican years. Many who do not consider themselves Galicians, may still be wooed with the promise of better civil rights, freer economic potential and the restoration of the ideals of the Spanish Republic, and thus we must do our best to attract these ideological drifters among the police force into our ranks."

GLC_Seize_Spanish_Assets:0 "Loot the Carcass of Castilian Imperialism"
GLC_Seize_Spanish_Assets_desc:0 "Many businesses of Spanish nationalists are located here in Galicia, ripe for the taking for the new regime’s war effort. From companies owned by loathsome lapdogs of Madrid to the lands of wealthy land owners, all will be seized from these traitors to the province they claim to love yet refuse to support in independence. We cannot allow such vipers a moment to breathe, or they will strike their venomous fangs into the freed skin of Galicia and poison its soil with their hateful existence." 

GLC_Haven_for_Exiled_Republicans:0 "Haven of Exiled Republicans"
GLC_Haven_for_Exiled_Republicans_desc:0 "The Spanish Republicans may have been driven from their lands to the New World or democratic bastions of Europe, but they are welcome in the newly independent republic of Galicia. Like the Spanish republicans, we dream of a peninsula free from tyrants and despots, be they military leaders of crowned noblemen. Though some republican Spaniards may find it distasteful to support a separatist regime, others see it as the only chance for an Iberian state that embodies the values of the perished Second Republic, and are willing to fight for a cause that is not their own if it gives them a chance to strike at the Madrid regime." 

GLC_Raise_The_Irmandinos:0 "The Irmandiños Ride to Ruin Once More"
GLC_Raise_The_Irmandinos_desc:0 "The Irmandinos, medieval anti-Castilian peasants, are the closest Galicia has had to an independence militancy during its long existence, and thus, if our army is to draw inspiration from somewhere, it is from these brave warriors of Galicia. As such, the name of Galician militias today draw their origin from them, and while our current warriors may hold slightly more sophisticated weapons and use more modern tactics, their bravery and loyalty to Galicia is only second to the brave Irmandinos of yore." 

GLC_Second_Rexurdimento:0 "Second Rexurdimento Begins!"
GLC_Second_Rexurdimento_desc:0 "The Galician Rexurdimento, or Renaissance, is perhaps the sole reason Galicianism and Galician nationalism exists at all. Spearheaded by titans of the local literature scene such as the mother of Galicianism Rosalía de Castro, the ever-productive Manuel Curros Enríquez and the academic pioneer Valentín Lamas Carvajal, this renaissance would see Galicianism become a veritable form of Iberian identity politics, and its repercussions are felt today in the independent Galician nation today. With figures such as Castelao, Pedrayo and Risco behind our new state, the second Rexurdimento is right around the corner for Galicia!" 

GLC_Fan_the_Flames_of_Budding_Galicianism:0 "Fan the Flames of Galicianism"
GLC_Fan_the_Flames_of_Budding_Galicianism_desc:0 "The Galicianists have long supported the independence project, but it has remained a somewhat small movement of Galician-speaking intelligentsia. However, with our independence well underway, it is time to spread the love of Galicia to the peasants, workers and regular people of Galicia as well, so that all can share the love of Galician culture and art." 

GLC_The_End_of_Seculos_Escuros:0 "Seculos Escuros Come to an End"
GLC_The_End_of_Seculos_Escuros_desc:0 "The battles are over, the guns fall silent and as the dust settles, Galicia stands strong, proud and most importantly, free. We have proven our enemies wrong and sceptics must now swallow their bitter words about the true power of Galician nationalism, for despite its humble beginnings, it now leads an entire nation in this corner of Iberia. Our trials have only just begun, but perhaps the greatest peak on our way have now been scaled." 


GLC_VNG_victory:0 "Populist Patriots of VNG Take Lead!"
GLC_VNG_victory_desc:0 "For as long as any of us remember, the Spanish flag has hung over the lands of Euskadi, keeping Basques chained to their dying empire. When the Republic was proclaimed four years ago, we expected the more liberal Spaniards to honour our customs, but that project was a short-lived and chaotic disaster, and only brought back the harsh military rule that again stomped on our independence. The new king claimed to bring more freedoms to us, but spat in our face with the rejection of the reforms. We have taken matters into our own hands, and while the future is uncertain, Basques have finally removed the shackle of Madrid."

GLC_Red_Chieftain:0 "Red Chieftain"
GLC_Red_Chieftain_desc:0 "Bilbao, our largest settlement, has long been a developing city. Its factories and mills churn out products day and night, everything from weapons to ships to civilian goods. The provisional government has decided to enact emergency nationalisation of these factories to supply us with everything we need to stop a potential Spanish invasion into our lands."

GLC_Reel_in_PG_Left_Flank:0 "Pulling in PG's Progressives"
GLC_Reel_in_PG_Left_Flank_desc:0 "The Iron Ring of Bilbao is a set of fortifications and bunkers around the entire Basque territory that was originally meant to defend our lands from possible Communard invasion, but our government has expanded it secretly for years now in case Spain would ever fall into a situation where we could proclaim independence. While nowhere near complete, these labyrinthine constructions could shelter our soldiers and civilians alike should the enemy over the border seek to threaten our freedom."

GLC_Clearing_Up_Confusion:0 "Our Shifty Leanings Solidified"
GLC_Clearing_Up_Confusion_desc:0 "The Spanish Guardia Civil had many of its troops posted on our lands, and the border with France was manned by some of Spain’s most loyal soldiers. When Alfonso was shot, these troops scrambled for the heartlands of Spain, and only a skeleton crew was left behind to keep us in check, a garrison that we easily defeated when our revolt began. There remains many guns and other weapons in storage, left by the Spaniards, and it would be a sin to leave them to rust in the warehouses. Basque patriots will put them to good use against their former owners."

GLC_Totalism_in_Aesthetics_Only:0 "Totalism in Aesthetics Only"
GLC_Totalism_in_Aesthetics_Only_desc:0 "Ertzana is the local police force of Basques hastily established from those native Guardia Asalto and Guardia Civil troops, who were present here when the instability and chaos engulfed Spain. While merely a militia by the standards of national militaries, these policemen are willing to die for our country and must serve as a first line of defence as we create a proper military force."

GLC_Galician_Right_to_Wine:0 "Defenders of Dionysos' Gift"
GLC_Galician_Right_to_Wine_desc:0 "The government of Euskadi has seen it fit to utilize volunteer tradesmen gathered from both our main parties of EAJ and EAE but also from the trade union ELA to further extend the Iron ring of Bilbao. We cannot build quite as strong fortifications in this short timespan as the main body of the Iron Ring has, but every bunker and trench helps in this difficult situation."

### Events ###
GLC.2.t:0 "Status of Labour Parties in Elections"
GLC.2.d:0 "With Galician independence secured, the provisional government led by Partido Galeguista has announced elections, but with much of the government dominated by conservative figures such as Vicente Risco, Ramon Otero Pedrayo and Xosé Filgueira Valverde, some have questioned whether the socialists of Unión Socialista Galega and the anarchists led by Ricardo Mella would be allowed to take part in the elections. Partido Galeguista itself is in an internal crisis on the matter with the liberals and social democrats within the party calling for the allowing of socialist parties while the conservatives see it as a dangerous and risky move. The Castelao government is struggling to find an answer to the situation, given that the socialists and anarchists supported the rebellion against Spain but also pose a threat to the continued existence of liberal democracy in the new Galician republic. While USG and the anarchists alone most likely do not have the popularity and party outreach to gather the hearts and minds of Galicians to pull a victory, many conservatives especially in Partido Republicano Agrario and Dereita Galeguista have called for immediate protests should the socialist entry into elections be allowed. The precarious political situation in Galicia demands immediate response, and the provisional government must reach an agreement or the situation may cause a worsening crisis."
GLC.2.a:0 "Allow socialist entry into elections."
GLC.2.b:0 "Shelter our liberty from these revolutionary elements."

GLC.3.t:0 "Week of Woes"
GLC.3.d:0 "With our decision to ban the socialists and syndicalists from participating in elections, the local branch of CNT-FAI and its allies in USG have proclaimed nation-wide strikes. While they have been unable to truly halt the Galician economy due to rather large number of non-union workers and the reluctance of non-socialist unions to join their actions, these strikes have nonetheless disrupted the dockyards, fledgling industrial sector and canneries of Galicia, causing some economic setbacks and even brief fisticuffs between anarchists and the paramilitary forces of Vicente Risco and Antonio Losadas, the Irmandades Nazonalista Galego. However, left-leaning members of the Galician political scene, especially the leader of Vangarda Nazionalista Galego, Álvaro de las Casas Blanco, have been vocal in their support for these strikes, calling the ban unconstitutional. Some claim that de las Casas is only using this to attract worker votes for his minor party, and the man does have a rather long and storied past as a populist, but he is not alone. Basílio Álvares, the leader of Galician agrarian movement, has been supportive of the strikers, no doubt because of his interest in agrarian socialism, and while rest of the Galician left-wing scene has been ambivalent or supportive of the line of Partido Galeguista, these two dissident voices have considerably weakened the government position. As such, some of the more hawkish anti-syndicalists in the government have begun to call for a police crackdown on the strikes, seeing the possibility of a revolution as only a matter of time. However, the more moderate members of the provisional government do not see this as a possibility, and in their view, the government can either attempt to negotiate with the strikers to achieve a middle ground, or simply reverse the ban as a sign of goodwill."
GLC.3.a:0 "The ban was a bad idea, we must give in."
GLC.3.b:0 "Perhaps we can negotiate a deal to end the riots without reversing the ban."
GLC.3.c:0 "This is a clear sign of syndicalist agitation for a revolution, crush them!"

GLC.4.t:0 "Crimson Banners Rise Over Galicia"
GLC.4.d:0 "As the Galician police forces were deployed to quell the on-going dockyard and industrial strikes, it soon became apparent that the anarchists under Ricardo Mella and the socialists of USG had come prepared. Police attempts to break the picket lines and drive the workers out from their blockades were met with aggressive counter-attacks, with police batons met with volleys of bricks and stones. Police officers soon found themselves overwhelmed by the strike guards, who had armed themselves with industrial tools, fishing harpoons and even with the few firearms that they had access to, and while the police deployed few of their exceedingly rare Bilbao armoured cars to the scene, they found themselves driven back by improvised firebombs. The worker militias captured revolvers, pistols and Destructor carbines from wounded or surrendering officers, and as the paramilitary groups converged upon the government buildings in areas like Ferrol, A Coruña, Vigo and Lugo, they were met mostly by demoralised and wholly outnumbered groups of former Guardia Civil officers and local policemen. Neither side was particularly interested in shedding blood, but it seemed more and more likely by the moment. The provisional government, watching the situation unfold, was paralysed by indecision, with the workers demanding their immediate surrender or a violent revolution would overthrow the regime either way. The police force was ready to open fire and put an end to the revolution, but this would inevitably lead to horrible casualties on both sides, forever staining the reputation of the provisional government, while a surrender would lead to a socialist takeover. The choice lay heavy on the heads of the provisional government, and as the emotionless barrels of two opposing sides stared at one another, the time for difficult decisions had arrived."
GLC.4.a:0 "The government, wishing to avoid a massacre, surrenders."
GLC.4.b:0 "The police open fire, and after a brief battle, the proletarian dead litter the fields."

GLC.5:0 "Enter Risco"

However, as the leadership of the rebellion, led by the venerable anarcho-collectivist Ricardo Mella, as well as his close ally Xohán Xesús González and daughter Urania Mella, were making their way to officially announce their victory, the worker militias in A Coruña were met by a new foe. The nationalist paramilitary group Irmandades Nazionalista Galego, trained in secret to face the Spaniards before the Galician independence war, had arrived, led by the eccentric far-right nationalist Vicente Risco and his right-hand man Antonio Losada, and they demanded an immediate disbanding of the revolutionary militias or a full-scale attack by the ING would begin. The proletarian masses, drunk with the newfound power, responded with immediate hostility at the demands of these reactionary nationalists, and a clash occurred between the two forces. The police forces, at least those who had not yet been disarmed, joined the side of the ING, and carnage followed as clashes between the two sides turned into firefights. However, given the lack of firepower and amateurish nature of the two militias, not even the leaders of either movement could tell which side was truly winning, and in the confusing melee, shots and blows were exchanged until one side broke into a rout, sealing the fate of Galicia to the winner’s hands.

Centrist big-tent parties, Partido Republicano Gallego of Anton Villar Ponte and Partido Galeguista of Alfonso Castelao, represent liberal currents within Basque society, with PRG advocating for a federalized Galician state and heavy contacts with the other new Iberian minority states of Catalonia and Euskadi. Partido Galeguista in turn is seeking to Europeanize Galicia and develop it both culturally and economically in the direction of truly modern state.\n\nRepresenting Galician right in turn are three parties, Irmandades da Fala led by Valentín Paz Andrade, made up of liberal conservatives and traditionalists. They support traditional Galician values and especially the cultural development of the new nation, and some rumours are also circulating about a potential installation of Galician monarchy should IdF triumph in the elections.

The rigours of leadership had been too much for the man, especially considering that he had already had a close brush with the death in 1924 but had survived thanks to the good care Mella had received while in exile in the French Commune. With Mella dead, a young nation in mourning and his funeral plans in full swing, the leadership question of Galician new government has come to the forefront of daily politics, with the provisional chairman of the Confederación Rexional Galaica, Jose Villaverde Velo, announcing that syndicalist elections, similar to those of the French model, would be held to determine who would step into the large shoes left behind by Ricardo Mella. Villaverde may be chosen to lead CRG in the upcoming elections, while Xohán Xesús González has been marked as the leader of the socialist USG. Others, such as the more moderate Federación de Sociedades Gallegas , Agrarias y Culturales of Ramón Suárez Picallo, the feminist Vanguardia Femenina of Urania Mella and the national syndicalist Bloque Social Campesino led by Santiago Montero Díaz have all announced their aim to take part in the elections, though whether they can campaign enough support remains to be seen. The FSGAC represents the interests of peasantry, artisans and craft unionists in Galicia, with ties to Partido Galeguista, and the organisation was originally started in exile but developed into a veritable force in Galicia proper. The BSC is a new entry into Galician politics, with Santiago Montero merging his own admiration of the Spanish national syndicalist Ramiro Ledesma with his long-time fascination with communism to create a nationalist, pluralist and rather authoritarian state, though he vows to respect the status of Galicia as a nation itself. Finally, the free women of Urania Mella represent a break-up between the CRG and the feminist forces, who have grown tired of the paternalistic attitudes of the anarchist cause. The election, while heavily favouring the CRG, is likely to be a contested affair nonetheless, and many fear the future if BSC is able to seize control, but for now, the situation remains stable."

There are peasants in these lands who still live in stone buildings that were made in the style their ancestors used during medieval times, there are farmers who use ploughs with designs dating back to Roman times, and there are villages that have never heard of socialism, anarchism or collectivism. There is a blight of the mind afoot in Galicia, and this blight is ignorance, a blight to be fully rooted out. Thankfully, with the revolution complete and the territory of Galicia under Ricardo Mella’s benevolent rule, these relics of the past can be finally pushed aside so that a new society can rise in its place. The Galician people must be taught the simple paradigm of our thought, the great ideals of Ricardo Mella. To him, collectivism is the sole guiding principle capable of bringing true liberty to the people, rejecting communism in the name of freedom and rejecting individualism in the name of solidarity.\n\nThe collectivist model of Mella affirms that the man is an absolute master of his work, and humanity is the absolute sovereign of the productive forces of nature. By giving humanity and man their due can collectivism be achieved. The new collectivist society of Galicia will emphasize freedom of the individual as part of a greater society, allowing them to create and produce without overbearing instructions and pressure from the state. Where certain societal functions and tasks are in need of doing, but remain beyond the means of individuals to fulfill on their own, the associations, unions and other groups will develop to complete these tasks, with free association at the centre of the function of these organisations.\n\nThe new anarchist society will not take from the individual what is their due, but instead provide them the economic state in which they can best fulfill themselves in a way that it benefits both them and the society at large, and as the ultimate sign of the newfound Galician liberty, these men will be able to freely choose whether it is their place to remain as part of the society or to depart it and harvest the sweat of their brow to themselves alone. While many ideologies and groups may bear the name of collectivism, it is only Mella’s original brainchild that shall ensure the upholding of true prosperity for all without ruthless oversteps."

The charlatans and fanatics of the old order shall be swept from their redoubts in churches and atheneums, 
until only those with the best interests of the people on their minds can lead people towards salvation. Once this collapse of faith is complete, and the smoke and mirrors of Christianity is brushed aside, the mind of Galicians shall become fertile soil for immortal human development.\n\nHeroes of the revolutionary struggle of the past and today will be celebrated, to be formed as an ideal to follow in the future, and the bankruptcy of beliefs brought about by the destruction of primitive faiths will be replaced with the true path to individual freedom and rationalist liberty. The leadership under Mella understands that for the average Galician peasant, this will be a terrifying journey, one that involves the complete dismantling of everything that once constituted their worldview, and as such, they may feel the need to rebel, to contest the future proclaimed by Mellistas.\n\nBut for the good of mankind, and more specifically in the contest of Galicia, for the good of the Galicians themselves, the new anarchist cause must continue to sign the hymns of liberty and educate the people through free and widespread educational institutions build in villages and towns throughout the nation. Once the average peasant has the means to learn, without pressure and coercion from a state or religious entity, it is hoped that they will do so out of curiosity and genuine wish.

However, while the collapse of the regime itself was bloodless, the anarchists and socialists of the new regime have been quick to mete chaotic justice upon landlords and rich business owners, these bandits in crimson cloaks were soon dealt with. However, with these measures came the question of just how revolutionary Mella’s new Galicia would be, and to that, the father of Galician anarchism already had an answer.\n\nTo him, the age old question of evolution versus revolution in left-wing political circles was not a question in itself, as Mella’s view on the matter was that they are not a direct answer to every situation but instead revolution is but a mere addition to evolution. The societal, political and economical realities of the current situation would determine the response, and only a revolution born out of essential ideals could bring about a just and equal society, instead of aggravating the Caesarianism of states.\n\nEvolution is an implacable, ever creeping force to Mella, which has throughout history removed despots born from absolutism in place of constitutional monarchs, disposed monarchs for parliamentary republics, brought slaves into serfdoms and serfs into proletariat, and in due time, will produce a society in which men are equal and the old forms of government are forgotten as the utopia of Anarchy sets in. Mella’s revolutions exist where they are needed, as part of the evolution towards anarchy, not as a separate process from it.\n\nJust like nature’s great mountain chains grow slowly over millenia, they can sometimes be quickly changed following a volcanic eruption, and such is also the role of revolutions. As such, with Galicia under his grip, the new anarchist territory will undergo the transformation towards anarchy not through a blanket revolutionary mentality but by allowing regional circumstances to determine the rapidity of the evolution"

This is what Ricardo Mella asked already in 1906, when the dreams of anarchism in Galicia were but mere lofty dreams of a committed man and his close circle. For many Galicians, they ring true just as hard today as they did during those years, and for all the talk of equality, liberty and progress that the republic of Spain espoused during its few years of existence, nothing seemed to change.\n\nThe Spanish monarchy, disinterested in the plight of the common man, was completely complacent as millions starved and fought among each other for a scrap of food or a piece of bread, and the republicans simply replaced this unfeeling crowned noble with a new buffoon to worship. As time has passed, the moniker the ruling caste has held has of course changed, but true change for the men and women with empty stomachs and weary bodies has never occured. The people yearn nothing more than to have enough bread to live by, a roof over their head and work to give them a purpose, and yet, the caste that holds all the power, the inquisition of the sated, cares little for them, inventing distractions and deceitful ideologies born from the arch-deceiver itself, the civilisation, to keep the people huddled in their misery.\n\nThis caste holds no more power over Galicia now, and as long as Mella’s old body allows him to, he will ensure that the illusions crafted by the state will hold no meaning in Galicia, and only once every human being on this wayward province has had their base needs met, can society again consider things like science and art worth pursuing. But these luxuries must not come at the cost of the average man, but instead they shall supplement the existence of the liberated spirit no longer yearning for a warm meal every waking hour of their lives."

However, much work remains to be done, and Ricardo Mella’s Nueva Utopia calls the loyal sons of the CRG to fulfill. In his dreams, Mella sees a Galicia of the common man, crafted by those uncouth and rough men who have toiled the lands and braved the seas of the Atlantic coast for millenia. A Galicia of the worker, not led by the idle priests, the greedy masters, the bloodthirsty military men or the red-clad tyrants. In Mella’s vision, a new Galicia will transform everything from societal traditions to city structures.\n\nA new Galicia, built from stone and concrete, will have cities with dedicated housing districts, factory districts, bustling market and most importantly, space for people to live and work freely. Gone are the cramped and noisy cities of the past, replaced with wide streets, large gardens separating buildings from one another, innovations of modernity such as electric stations and water pumps providing for all the needs of the Galicians. The entire city is transformed into a celebration of humanity and its ingenuity, its magnificent ability to create and toil for the community. The industrial sector houses billowing chimneys and gigantic machines that toil day and night to provide for the people, employing fewer and fewer workers as automation becomes the aim for industrial development.\n\nOn a societal level, the people of Galicia are educated to abandon the need to police the actions of others, so that individuals can live their lives without being policed by their peers into living a life of servitude towards the societal conventions and taboos. The superstitions of the past are banished in the great atheneums of the new era, which house the encyclopaedic knowledge of the human race and transfer ás much of this knowledge as humanely possible onto the generations of the future.\n\nThis will allow children to pursue their desired course of life, perhaps producing unequal results but with the same capabilities given to them by the society from which they sprang forth. The new societal model produces a new man, a renegade among humanity, who fights in co-operation with his comrades so that the new state of being is brought to all mankind to share. The painful reality of the matter is that the fading health of Ricardo Mella will not allow him to see this transformation happen, and he has fully come to accept it, but thanks to his efforts in Galicia, the first seeds of this New Utopia have been sown."

Mella has long been highly critical of the so called ‘illegalists’, who utilize the anarchist theory of propaganda of the deed as justification to steal, rob and murder perceived enemies. In the eyes of Mella, they are merely continuing the regimes of spoliation and oppression that the revolutionary order was aimed to overthrow, and a true anarchist society has no place for such chaotic and violent excesses.\n\nMella considers violence at best an unfortunate last straw of an anarchist uprising, and in times of peace, the society of the anarchists is one of freedom and solidarity between men, not one where those with the power can exert their dominance over others through the barrel of a gun. Wrapping murderous intent into an ideological justification makes it no less condemnable, and in the new Galicia, such acts of wanton violence will receive their fair punishment from the communal courts."

Galician anarchists as a whole have been relatively hesitant to take part in the violent actions of the Catalan and Andalusian counterparts, and while there have been those especially within the circle headed by José Moreno that called for a more direct and violent struggle against state and capitalism, Villaverde has for the most part managed to contain the most excessive outbursts of anarchism in Galicia.\n\nHowever, while the CRG chairman has been a strong ally of the Spanish moderate anarchist wing headed by the likes of Ángel Pestaña, Joan Peiró and Salvador Seguí, he never officially joined the project of Pestaña to establish a legitimate anarcho-syndicalist party in Spain. With Galicia under the anarchist masses now, Villaverde has abandoned his previous hesitancy towards the matter, and the union has been transformed into a party-union hybrid, influenced by the ideas of Seguí and the French unionist movements, with the idea of participating in elections and maintaining legitimacy through democratic means. Villaverde has also adopted Pestaña’s ideas on mass action, where the societal revolution would be carried out on the streets through immense agitation, social work and constant organisation of the workers, until one day all the remnants of inequality and capitalist system are washed away thanks to the sheer popular will.\n\nThis popular will shall also be harnessed against the gravest threat to all moderate anarchists, the reactionary and revolutionary tyrants and despots of the world. Under Villaverde and his new vision for CRG, Galicia shall rise to become a bastion of liberty, denouncing the conservatives and nationalists of the right as well as the red-tinted butchers of national syndicalism alike, and should they ever attempt to destroy the newfound freedom of Galicia, they will become the target of the liberated people’s divine wrath.

In fact, the union has struggled to conquer the mainland itself, with many agrarian societies aligning more closely with parties such as ORGA, Partido Galeguista and the left-wing agrarians of Basilio Álvarez.\n\nMuch of CRG’s support comes from the coastal towns and cities of Ferrol, A Coruña and Vigo, with the federal unions Federación Regional Marítima, Sindicato El Despertar Marítimo and Sindicato de Industria Pesquera pulling in nearly half of the entire wider union’s membership. Given Galicia’s lack of industry, many fishermen and sailors have began to pressure the leadership of the union, especially the ruling chairman José Villaverde Velo, into taking a more active role in marine affairs. José Moreno and Claro José Sendón, noted troublemakers within the CRG known for advocating for a far more revolutionary and violent turn within the union, have been calling for Villaverde to take action and utilise the talents of the Galician maritime fleet to help the wider Internationale in their struggle for the international revolution.\n\nMonero and Sendón posit that Galicians could use their fleet to covertly attack capitalist shipping, becoming in essence red pirates of yore, pulling from the tradition of Galician corsairs such as Buenaventura Marcó del Pont Bori and Benito Soto Aboal, though with far less self-serving greed and far more revolutionary necessity. According to the pair of radicals, and their rather enthusiastic supporters among the various naval unions, the best way for Galicia to contribute is to arm its merchant ships and use them as raiders against the pillagers, for all goods destined for places like Hamburg, Fiume and Algiers would better serve the revolution here and in the three large Internationale nations. However, such actions would cause repercussions from foreign powers, and Galicia does not possess a great fleet of actual warships to defend itself with, despite the efforts of the Ferrol shipyards.

This mineral is tungsten, and due to its incredible hardness and various other qualities, such as unparalleled heat resistance, a further refined tungsten carbide is used in construction and metalworking. It is also very important to the war efforts of various nations, as tungsten can be utilised in different types of artillery ammunition, typically in the form of armour-piercing composite rigid rounds, where a tank or field gun shell has a tungsten core meant to pierce enemy armour through sheer kinetic energy alone.\n\nIn addition to its offensive use, it is also used as a compound for various highly sophisticated or effective tools and materials. The large powers of Europe have been quick to utilise the material to its maximum capacity in their war machines, but this new ‘Wolfram fever’ ,as the hunt for more tungsten has been colloquially called, has taken a completely new turn lately. The German empire, with its global empire of exploitation, has been sourcing its tungsten from the Chinese concessions and its client state of Burma, but with the Chinese warlords returning to their warlike ways and the German colonial holdings in Asia increasingly threatened by the Japanese, the source of German tungsten may very well be at risk. On European soil, only two nations possess a great deal of tungsten to this day, first and most important being the Kingdom of Portugal, and second being Spain. However, with Galician independence, we have now inherited over seventy percent of Spanish tungsten thanks to the Mines of San Finx.\n\nNeedless to say, the Communards have been incredibly interested in this bounty, and the CRG government is more than happy to deliver, but first, the numerous issues with the mines have to be addressed. The living conditions of workers are abhorrent, with the original English administration of the mines from the company, San Finx Tin Mines Limited, completely ignoring the damages caused by the particles released from the mining of the material, which caused silicosis in the workers. Similarly, smuggling and rowdy behaviour is a daily woe in the camp, because there is not enough housing and even living space for the numerous workers.\n\nWith further funding coming from the Internationale to restart the mining operations, of course aided by the fact that there is no longer good-for-nothing owners skimming most of the profits to line their pockets, perhaps the mines can finally offer their bounty without compromising the well-being of the miners. With their help, the inevitable war with the Kaiserreich is bound to be an easy one, with the Galician tungsten effortlessly piercing the Panzers of Wilhelm in battle. "

However, like her father, Mella has never been afraid to voice her discomfort with the way things are run in Galicia, and ever since the revolutionary victory against the bands of Risco and the feeble bourgeois republic, she has been pushing CRG and other left-wing parties to actually honour their promises for the women of Galicia. When the provisional revolutionary government did not react to her calls quickly enough, Mella broke with CRG and founded her own anarcha-feminist organisation known as Vanguardia Femenina, which has since gained a following among those women of Galicia who feel that the main union and various other parties are not doing enough for the cause of female emancipation.\n\nRecognising the threat of splintering, chairman Villaverde and various other union leaders from regional branches, such as the agrarian leader Ezequiel Rey Turnes and Robustiano Collazo Álvarez, director of the Sindicato de Industria Pesquera, have convened on the topic of women’s unionism. These leaders of Galician anarchism came to the conclusion that unless the syndicates started to compromise with Mella’s view, it would create increased rivalry among the feminists and regular syndicalists, and given that a large part of CRG is women, the repercussions could be immense. In a time when CRG faces unprecedented rivalry from other left-wing parties such as Unión Socialista Galega and Bloque Social Campesino, Mella’s organisation could be our downfall.\n\nAs such, the chairmen of the various federal unions agreed upon further negotiations with Mella to bring the Vanguardia Femenina back under CRG control, or at the very least, into a coalition with it. Initial negotiations with Mella were relatively tense, with the feminist propagandist very aware of her better negotiation position, but eventually a compromise was reached, and VF was integrated as the women’s section of CRG after large concessions were made on the part of Villaverde and various other union leaders.

The first one to land such a blow from our wayward province was Antonio Soto, known accurately as ‘El Gallego Soto’ in his adopted homeland of Argentina, or perhaps more fittingly, Patagonia, where he now stands as the leader of the Patagonian Workers’ Front, fighting against the Buenos Aires regime. The exploits of Soto allowed for the Patagonian workers to drive back their overlords in La Anita farm during the Second Patagonian Strike, but Soto had been active in anarchist politics since his teenager years, and participated in labour battles against the authorities from a young age.\n\nIt may appear surprising that Soto is such a prominent figure in Argentine syndicalist politics, but in truth, many Argentinian socialist and syndicalist figures can draw their ancestry to the Galician immigrants, and many current leaders of their cause are direct Catalan or Galician first-generation immigrants, driven to the New World by the crackdowns of dictator Primo de Rivera and later on, the one-party rule that followed the Sanjurjada coup. Now, Argentina has languished under a dictator not much different from the Spanish caudillo, with their Manuel Carlés, whose political program seeks to squash any rights of the workers.\n\nSoto’s resistance mirrors our fight for recognition, and thus large diplomatic cooperation has begun with the Patagonian workers, with some Galician syndicalist leaders even floating the idea of forming a volunteer battalion to be sent to fight in Patagonia, though this was quickly shot down since the Madridian threat is too large for us to contest. Still, Soto has become something of a folk hero to the new Galician syndicalist order, and propaganda posters bearing his face are seen at street corners and bulletin boards throughout the cities of Galicia, almost as frequently as those of the independence war’s martyrs or the venerable Galician anarchist Ricardo Mella. The Argentine connection is an inspiration for Galician syndicalists and as long as Soto’s struggle continues, the homeland will stand in support for the Patagonian workers to the bitter end."

However, despite the utopian vision of Mella, there are realities to the Galician experience with anarcho-syndicalism that makes this imaginary future rather unbelievable in the eyes of the conventional unionists of the Atlantic coast. Instead of being hell-bent on creating factories and urban planning marvels, we must focus on creating a better life in accordance of the Galician life.\n\nFrom the small hamlets of fishermen to the idyllic rural villages of central Galicia, CRG representatives must abandon lofty ideals of massive churning cities with districts for different forms of production and leisure, and instead focus on improving the existing infrastructure, dismantling sources of inequality and expanding the tools available to the peasants, fishermen and artisans of the territory. That way, we do not alienate the common people, many of whom still view us with suspicion due to their religious nature and reliance on local elite, and instead show them the fruits of anarcho-syndicalism in action.\n\nThe new utopia promoted by CRG and its leader, chairman Villaverde, is one that respects the age-old tradition of Galicia with a modernising touch, but without the rather excessively transformative idealism of Mella. Perhaps one day this noble land is industrialised to such degree that Mella’s vision can be put into reality, but for now, the Nova Utopia of our greatest syndicalist hero will be tweaked and downgraded to such a degree that it can be reliably achieved."

While CRG is hardly supportive of a Galician nation state, the union’s leaders have began to look into the wider Galician diaspora with dreams of unification.\n\nAfter all, so many within the Galician diaspora left Europe after the various capitalist exploitations ruined the economy of our province, and many emigres were young, working age men of anarchist or socialist leanings.\n\nThese union leaders, especially those with ties to the New World such as the returning Galicianist syndicalist Ernesto Atanasio Janeiro, Orencio Abalde Rodríguez and Desiderio Comesaña Prado, founder of the Sociedad Obrera de Cultura and Ateneo Obrero de Divulgación Social, have been promoting unity with the wider Galician diaspora, especially with Argentina.\n\nThey posit that the Galician community overseas is already in some ways anarchist in its nature, with its local communities and interest groups rescinding their Galician nationalist identity towards the establishment of a Galician national state, focusing more on serving the interests of the Galicians in their local communities instead, promoting collaboration between all types of ideological Galician diaspora members for the sake of finding a common ground for the Galician people.\n\nThis has led to curious situations where liberals, conservatives, socialists and anarchists have banded under the common flag to pursue the best possible outcomes for Galicians in their new home. As such, supporters of this unity with the diaspora promote a highly decentralised, anational entity which would support Galician communities all around the globe without a state. However, many are not convinced, claiming that such focus towards the Galician people, even if not inherently statist, would be a grave insult to the international workers’ movement and its aim for an united Earth without needless distinctions between peoples."

GLC.113.t:0 "For a More Democratic Military of Galicia"
GLC.113.d:0 "The Galician anarcho-syndicalists were some of the first groups to organise militia groups following the uprising against Spain and the Bourbon crown in particular, and while this was not stemming from a nationalist sentiment compared to most other militia groups in the Galician forces, the anarchist fighters proved to be just as fierce combatants as their nationalist counterparts. However, now that the fighting has subsided, many militias have been disbanded or merged into the newly established Galician army, but with the anarcho-syndicalists in control of the local government, many have began to demand that the army be either completely abolished or at least heavily decentralised so that another hierarchic vestige of the state is weakened.\n\nInstead, CRG leadership and especially capable military men such as the famed Leonese guerilla Marcelino de la Parra as well as our homegrown FAI member and main militia commander José Moreno, have argued that instead of a centralised military, Galician forces should be formed into local defense groups known milicias confederais. These militias would oversee different sections of Galicia during times of war, focusing on securing their own local villages, municipalities and towns from enemy attack, committing to guerilla warfare if an area is occupied or integrating themselves into wider battle columns if the battlefield necessities call for it.\n\nSimilarly, the entire military structure will undergo a degree of reorganisation, with chain of command becoming more democratic as officers are voted for by the men who serve under their leadership. More conservative or statist officers have voiced concerns that this will break the quality of the officer corps as now leaders of entire platoons and companies can be chosen based solely on how good of a crowd pleaser they are, yet many consider it a better test of leadership if the officers can be kicked out through popular vote instead of having to go through military bureaucracy.\n\nThere is still a degree of debate on whether women should be allowed to hold a rank within the army, with supporters of this noting the example of Esperanza Rodríguez Gómez, a captain of the Milicias Populares Galegas during the independence war, as well as many women fighters who rose up during the war spontaneously to battle for the fate of Galicia free from Spain. Traditional gender roles have influenced many within the critics of this changed, but some have also noted that the women’s role as supporters to the war effort is too important to change for the sake of getting more bodies to the frontlines."

GLC.150.d:0 "The Galicianist movement has seen its greatest triumph in the independence of our fair and beautiful young land, but its work is far from over. Whether it is through the creation of stable and functional new state or the cultural evolution of budding second Rexurdimento into a blooming flower of new Galician golden era, the Galicianist movement of all shades and ideological leanings will have decades worth of inspiration from our victory. However, with independence of Galicia, there has been a considerably more prominent shift in the two constituent parts of Galicianism. The young patriots of Galicia are completely electrified from the independence, and have been driven into a frenzy of patriotism, holding rallies, political gatherings and impromptu nationalist celebrations all over our great nation.\n\nWhile the old guard of Galicianism was originally enthusiastic about this national rejuvenation, they have become somewhat critical of this fervour, claiming that the youth reformism is pushing the ideological background of Galicianism into avenues it was never meant for. However, despite the inherent conservative and traditionalist leanings of Antón Losada Diéguez, the president of Galicia, he has been an outspoken supporter of this young patriotic expression. Losada views it as a means to push Galicianism further, to light the fire within even the oldest political chieftains so that the love of our young nation can transform it to ever greater heights. To Losada, the young hearts of Galicia will carry the flag with such pride that it allows for an ever more rapid realization of our national ideals, and thus it is not only the task of the youth to carry out, but an obligation of the old guard to also adopt a similar mindset.\n\nThe Old Guard, who laid the seeds of Galicianism into the fertile soil of Galicia must now rejuvenate the movement in accord with the new patriots, so that one day, these brave idealists are prepared to take the reins themselves. What Galicianism has already achieved is rather remarkable, but in Losada’s vision, it is not enough to be content with what has already been achieved, but in what the movement can create if it is supported to the utmost capacity that Galicia can muster."

GLC.151.d:0 "Antón Losada is a man of tradition, and his position as a manor lord has always made him a lover of high culture, especially that of Italian origin. But where works of Dante and Leopardi are dear to his heart and above the works of German contemporaries in a rather considerable margin, Losada’s love for the peasantry of Galicia finds no equal even in these great works of literature. To him, the peasants of Galicia are not just the inhabitants of the land, but its soul and spirit, as directly tied to it as the crops they grow, the mountains they live amongst and the sea that washes the rocks of Galician coast every minute of every day. Losada ties this belonging of the peasants to the Galician language, and posits that the central peculiarity of Galician is its great assortment of words related to farming, the eternal tradition of our lands.\n\nThe city dwellers may have their own ideals and traditions, but their ways do not come close to the primordial culture of the Galician village, and thus, with Partido Republicano Agrario fully in control, the cities will be forced to relinquish their dastardly grip upon the rural countrysides, so that the true soul of Galicia no longer languished under the dominance of urban elites. Villages, rural roads and other infrastructure will be the main source of development programs, while national holidays celebrating the seasonal changes will be created to venerate the ancient profession.\n\nCultural programs will be opened in villages and rural towns so that the lowliest peasant or tenant farmer of Galicia will have access to the pearls of Galicianism, and agrarian improvement programs will be performed with the help of local scientific institutions so that the toilers of our native land can have the best possible means to work the earth. It is hoped that these measures will truly light the fire of Galicianism in the hearts of the peasantry, and make them realize just how much this fair land is the creation of their century-old traditions and ways of life, just as Losada has realized during his life."

GLC.152.t:0 "A New, Natural Galicia"
GLC.152.d:0 "After the right-wing agrarians took power in Galicia, one of the central tenets of the party soon evolved to be the dismantling of the artificiality of modern life. For too long had mankind been deceived with the ideal that to be modern and create progress in society, a society needed to direct more and more towards centralisation, large cities, big industrial complexes and uniformity of nationalities. The Galician agrarians reject this notion. The currency societal conflict, a social war between the workers and capitalists, stems from this very problem, for the workers are forced into large lifeless cities, and the capitalists see only profit to be had in larger and larger production lines and manufactories. The societal order is so intertwined with this development trajectory, that if the workers were to overthrow the capitalist ruling class, they would achieve very little, for the industrial nation would still remain and simply create new rulers demanding more and more production.\n\nGalician nationalism, as it stands, is against these delusions of true progress, and wishes that a society could return to a more natural state, one where the smog-filled cities and tight living quarters are instead viewed as the entrapments of a world run by capital and greed, not the true progress of mankind. A true paradise of the Galicianists is the verdant and fertile rural lands of this beautiful province, and the lifeblood of the movement stems not from the cities and factories but from the humble peasant villages. As such, massive efforts have been put into achieving a larger traffic towards a more rural life, with an expansion on land sales towards single-family farmers, with compensation paid to the landowners, as well as the hiring of agricultural experts, who are able to determine where more arable land could be found.\n\nHowever, president Losada and his supporters do realize that a modern nation cannot run without factories to some extent, and thus programs have been started that would see the expansion of a more naturalised city infrastructure. Given the low amount of industrialisation in Galicia, this should be relatively easy to achieve. The goal of the entire large scale transformation is to alter the consciousness of Galicians, to abandon economic development as the only worthwhile cause in the world, so that they may embrace God’s wonderful creations on Earth."

GLC.153.t:0 "Example of Terence MacSwiney"
GLC.153.d:0 "The Galician cause for independence does have its own martyrs and heroes, but when compared to its Catalan and Basque counterparts, violent resistance towards Madrid rule was rather rare until it exploded in the revolt against the Castillans not too long ago. As such, while Partido Republicano Agrario has erected monuments for the heroes of this resistance war, there are other martyred souls not related directly to the Galician fight for freedom who have also received a curious tribute from Antón Losada and his party. One such figure has been Terence MacSwiney, former mayor of Cork and hero of the Irish independence, who Losada aims to honour with a statue of his own in one of the larger cities of Galicia. A man Losada has revered since the Easter Rising in Ireland, MacSwiney to Losada represents the face of human persistence and resistance that is not driven by momentary fervour but from a deep nationalist sentiment.\n\nIn Losada’s eyes, nationalism in this world is often born from force and interest of various factions, not because it comes from a deep love for the fatherland but because it benefits one group or another. This type of nationalism is thus worthless compared to one that comes from the adoration of one’s place of birth and the stubbornness to see the region freed, as MacSwiney demonstrated. Having been imprisoned for his beliefs, MacSwiney was left to rot in prison and eventually starved to death, but every torturous moment in that slow decay was, in Losada’s eyes, spent to ensure that the nation MacSwiney revered would one day be free.\n\nIt is this immense spiritual fortitude that Losada deeply admires, and in these post-independence days, when Galicia returns to a degree of normality and seeks to assert itself as a member of the global network of nation states, Losada seeks to emphasize and usher in an era of spiritual nationalism, unbending in the most difficult times, so that every man and woman in this beautiful land may have the tools needed to give their all so that the white and blue flag may wave over the Atlantic coast forevermore."

GLC.154.d:0 "Galicia has never been a real cradle of Carlism unlike regions such as Basque Country, Navarra and Andalusia, but the traditionalist movement has nonetheless had some influence in the region. Before his nationalist and republican turn, president Losada was a Carlist himself, and his status as a large landowner and wealthy nobleman made him one of the key supporters of the cause in this wayward region. Given their immense hatred for the Madrid Alfonsists and deep-rooted belief in local autonomy, or fueros, the Galician Carlists for the most part supported the war against Spain, with some notable exceptions such as Jesus Cora y Lira, one of the main supporters of Carlos Pio for a Carlist pretender.\n\nThe movement has never been particularly interested in democracy or republicanism, but even during republican years, numerous Carlists participated in elections and sought to influence the new system to adopt more Carlist-adjacent ideological leanings without the need for a Carlist uprising. With Losada’s moderate traditionalist party in the rise in Galicia, many Carlists have been attracted to it, some even outright joining it such as the moderate Carlist militant Manuel Cerezales González and the eccentric José María Castroviejo. However, this recent influx of Carlists into the party of Losada has made some question whether he plans to install a Carlist monarchy here in Galicia now that the party holds power, though Losada himself has been adamant on his republican positions.\n\nNonetheless, some of the Carlists have suggested that the party adopts a more traditionalist line of thinking alongside its agrarian and nationalist ideals. This would be a rather moderate form of Integrism, a Spanish variation on the Lusitanian integralism which espouses a radically decentralized, deeply pious and politically accidentalist form of traditionalism. Losada himself has been relatively hesitant to pursue this direction, but there is some degree of support among the various cliques of PRA towards such an ideological renewal."

GLC.155.t:0 "Democracy with a Hint of Theocracy"
GLC.155.d:0 "A key part of president Losada’s program for Galicia is his aim to Galicianize the Church and Christianize Galicia. In his view, the nationalism of Galicia is a force that can rejuvenate the local church, so long reeling under the influence of the wider Spanish Catholic community. Similarly, in his view, a Galicia that does not seek spiritual unity brought about by a strong Catholic society is doomed to fall for the predations of larger nations, such as Portugal and Spain. As such, Galician church will be detached as heavily as possible from the Spanish church, made easier by the fact that many high-ranking Spanish administrators and clergymen escaped the region following the uprising against Madrid, and some, such as the reigning archbishop, had been assassinated by revolutionary reds.\n\nWith the rise of Fernado Quiroga, a local Galician member of the clergy, to the position of archbishop of Santiago, it would appear that Losada’s first step in the plan is well in motion, and Partido Republicano Agrario has expended considerable funds setting up seminary schools and other facilities for church personnel training here in Galicia, hoping to attract further local recruits to supplement or replace Spaniards. Similarly, programs aimed at renovating or expanding existing infrastructure of the church in various parishes, as well as repairing damage caused by the war and the following political chaos, have been begun all around the nation, with the aim of creating jobs as well as bringing people closer to the church. Under Losada’s rule, the Galician way of life will become as tied to religion as possible, and religion shall become as tied to the nationalist cause of PRA as possible.\n\nThe process will take ages, of course, and much of the clergy will obviously resist these changes, but without such drastic alteration of the church, we will forever have to deal with a rebellious priestly class aligned with the false shepherds of Madrid. The most fervent Catholics in the party have even suggested that to truly create a Catholic Galicia worthy of God’s grace, we should follow a similar model to the Andorran co-prince system, where the member of the lay politicians serve as the head of government while the archbishop of Santiago shall serve as the nominal head of state. While unorthodox, and deeply resented by members of the left, this change could further solidify the Christian-centric nature of Galicia"

The caciques of Galicia, who have for so long dominated the politics of rural villages and towns, shall receive no mercy in the matter, with their ill-begotten goods and hoarded lands being redistributed to the poorest populations of Galicia or pushed into programs aimed at creating traditionalist welfare around the nation.\n\nNo longer can these political playboys dominate the nation’s politics through their corruption and thuggish tactics, and those who have not had the good sense to flee shall be expelled or imprisoned for their past actions.

However, a factor which sets Losada apart from his liberal counterparts was his readiness to use force for the independence of Galicia, with Losada’s training with the militias of Irmandades Nazionalista Galego to ensure that if the time would ever come, Galicians would be ready to fight for the freedom of their land. The Irmandades fought alongside the more ad hoc militias of the nation during the war for independence, and their exploits are the stuff of legends that will inspire the newly established Galician army for decades to come, but as the importance of ING grows, so does the influence of its most famed member. Losada may have been the man behind much of the organisation and training of the paramilitary group, but over the years, his close ally and friend Vicente Risco has grown to exert more and more power within the militia group.\n\nCurrently, while Losada and other members of the ING still command much respect within the group, it has developed to become little more than the personal tool of posturing for Risco as he attempts to push his own, very eccentric if not borderline esoteric agendas on the young Galician state. If Losada and the other more moderate members of the ING, such as Valentin Paz, are to allow Risco to continue his nonsense, there is no telling when he earns enough power to become more than a nuisance. While he is a respected writer and politician, Risco is too prone to extremist ideas to be allowed to do his own thing without supervision, though some argue that he should be kicked out altogether because he is a liability and an easy talking point to the enemies of PRA to use as a political tool. However, without his support, the ING may lose a considerable amount of its supporters and of course, the political clout of Risco, which could be devastating to the PRA popularity."

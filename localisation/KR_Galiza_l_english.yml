### Focuses ###
GLC_focus:0 "Galician Focus Tree"

GLC_Liberty:0 "Nós, Nomeámonos!" 
GLC_Liberty_desc:0 "The fledgling Galician nationalism, long obscured in the shadow of its more prominent cousins in Catalonia and Basque Country, has finally had its unexpected fulfillment. With the support of Basque and Catalan militias, the Galician patriots have seized control of the wayward region, forcing the Ferrol garrison to surrender. Already, exiled Galician nationalists from the New World are making their way to our shores to join the fray, and for the first time ever since the independent Galician realms, this Atlantic province of Spain is free. The war against Spain looms in the horizon, but loyal sons of Galicia are prepared to defend their newfound libery to the end."

GLC_A_Corunan_Factories:0 "The Crown of Atlantic Coast"
GLC_A_Corunan_Factories_desc:0 "A Coruña, the crown of Atlantic, is hardly the industrial giant of Iberia, but even this backwards region has some semblance of industry. While limited in scope to consumer goods, civilian hardware and textiles, it is nonetheless capable of supplying some equipment and necessary goods for our rebellion against the Spanish regime. Similarly, whatever material can be scrounged up from the Ferrol garrison and dockyards for military use will be immediately shipped to the militia units of our provisional army, so that they do not need to go into battle armed with shovels and pitchforks."

GLC_Batallon_Literario:0 "Raising a New Batallón Literario"
GLC_Batallon_Literario_desc:0 "Batallón Literario is a military unit type native to Galicia, that has existed in one form or another since the mid-1600s, though the most notable iteration of this venerable martial tradition was the one formed in 1808 to fight against the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte. It is usually made up of students and faculty members of the university of Galicia, and the new Batallón Literario will take a similar shape of volunteers. While these men will hardly be more experienced or trained than those of their militia counterparts, it is hoped that their nationalism for Galicia propels them into battle with great fervour, and that through their education, they may be able to become the officers and commanders of the future Galician national army."

GLC_Summon_Our_Celtic_Brothers:0 "Our Brothers at the End of the Earth"
GLC_Summon_Our_Celtic_Brothers_desc:0 "Galicia is one of the most debated regions of Iberia in its origins, as Galicians are often considered to be Celtic in origin, and while the language they speak is not Celtic indeed, we do share the heritage rather proudly alongside our Portuguese brothers. As such, the Lusitanian regime, while not particularly interested in the republicanism and love of democracy that the Galicians espouse, is nonetheless likely to assist us out of sheer support for their formerly Celtic brethren and the bond that our small province shares with the Portuguese as the most Atlantic lands of Iberia."

GLC_Bring_the_Diaspora_Home:0 "The Cuban Diaspora Returns Home!"
GLC_Bring_the_Diaspora_Home_desc:0 "When the Second Republic was squashed, many Galicians fled Spain out fear for military repressions, especially those who had been active in Galicianist sectors. However, now that the rebellion is in full swing and the Spanish control over the peninsula is fading, Galicians from all over the globe are returning to their homeland en masse, eager to take up arms for the liberation of their beloved province. Most are coming from the island of Cuba, where large quantities of Galicians fled to even during the Primo de Rivera era, and where they formed communities of Galicians yearning for a liberated homeland. With their help, the ranks of Galician militias are swelling to untold heights."

GLC_Disarm_Guardia_Civil:0 "Wrest Guardias Out of Spanish Control"
GLC_Disarm_Guardia_Civil_desc:0 "Many Guardia Civil officers here in Galicia support the Madrid regime, but there are also a lot of those who yearn back to the freedom that was promised during the republican years. Many who do not consider themselves Galicians, may still be wooed with the promise of better civil rights, freer economic potential and the restoration of the ideals of the Spanish Republic, and thus we must do our best to attract these ideological drifters among the police force into our ranks."

GLC_Seize_Spanish_Assets:0 "Loot the Carcass of Castilian Imperialism"
GLC_Seize_Spanish_Assets_desc:0 "Many businesses of Spanish nationalists are located here in Galicia, ripe for the taking for the new regime’s war effort. From companies owned by loathsome lapdogs of Madrid to the lands of wealthy land owners, all will be seized from these traitors to the province they claim to love yet refuse to support in independence. We cannot allow such vipers a moment to breathe, or they will strike their venomous fangs into the freed skin of Galicia and poison its soil with their hateful existence." 

GLC_Haven_for_Exiled_Republicans:0 "Haven of Exiled Republicans"
GLC_Haven_for_Exiled_Republicans_desc:0 "The Spanish Republicans may have been driven from their lands to the New World or democratic bastions of Europe, but they are welcome in the newly independent republic of Galicia. Like the Spanish republicans, we dream of a peninsula free from tyrants and despots, be they military leaders of crowned noblemen. Though some republican Spaniards may find it distasteful to support a separatist regime, others see it as the only chance for an Iberian state that embodies the values of the perished Second Republic, and are willing to fight for a cause that is not their own if it gives them a chance to strike at the Madrid regime." 

GLC_Raise_The_Irmandinos:0 "The Irmandiños Ride to Ruin Once More"
GLC_Raise_The_Irmandinos_desc:0 "The Irmandinos, medieval anti-Castilian peasants, are the closest Galicia has had to an independence militancy during its long existence, and thus, if our army is to draw inspiration from somewhere, it is from these brave warriors of Galicia. As such, the name of Galician militias today draw their origin from them, and while our current warriors may hold slightly more sophisticated weapons and use more modern tactics, their bravery and loyalty to Galicia is only second to the brave Irmandinos of yore." 

GLC_Second_Rexurdimento:0 "Second Rexurdimento Begins!"
GLC_Second_Rexurdimento_desc:0 "The Galician Rexurdimento, or Renaissance, is perhaps the sole reason Galicianism and Galician nationalism exists at all. Spearheaded by titans of the local literature scene such as the mother of Galicianism Rosalía de Castro, the ever-productive Manuel Curros Enríquez and the academic pioneer Valentín Lamas Carvajal, this renaissance would see Galicianism become a veritable form of Iberian identity politics, and its repercussions are felt today in the independent Galician nation today. With figures such as Castelao, Pedrayo and Risco behind our new state, the second Rexurdimento is right around the corner for Galicia!" 

GLC_Fan_the_Flames_of_Budding_Galicianism:0 "Fan the Flames of Galicianism"
GLC_Fan_the_Flames_of_Budding_Galicianism_desc:0 "The Galicianists have long supported the independence project, but it has remained a somewhat small movement of Galician-speaking intelligentsia. However, with our independence well underway, it is time to spread the love of Galicia to the peasants, workers and regular people of Galicia as well, so that all can share the love of Galician culture and art." 

GLC_The_End_of_Seculos_Escuros:0 "Seculos Escuros Come to an End"
GLC_The_End_of_Seculos_Escuros_desc:0 "The battles are over, the guns fall silent and as the dust settles, Galicia stands strong, proud and most importantly, free. We have proven our enemies wrong and sceptics must now swallow their bitter words about the true power of Galician nationalism, for despite its humble beginnings, it now leads an entire nation in this corner of Iberia. Our trials have only just begun, but perhaps the greatest peak on our way have now been scaled." 


GLC_VNG_victory:0 "Populist Patriots of VNG Take Lead!"
GLC_VNG_victory_desc:0 "For as long as any of us remember, the Spanish flag has hung over the lands of Euskadi, keeping Basques chained to their dying empire. When the Republic was proclaimed four years ago, we expected the more liberal Spaniards to honour our customs, but that project was a short-lived and chaotic disaster, and only brought back the harsh military rule that again stomped on our independence. The new king claimed to bring more freedoms to us, but spat in our face with the rejection of the reforms. We have taken matters into our own hands, and while the future is uncertain, Basques have finally removed the shackle of Madrid."

GLC_Red_Chieftain:0 "Red Chieftain of Noia"
GLC_Red_Chieftain_desc:0 "Bilbao, our largest settlement, has long been a developing city. Its factories and mills churn out products day and night, everything from weapons to ships to civilian goods. The provisional government has decided to enact emergency nationalisation of these factories to supply us with everything we need to stop a potential Spanish invasion into our lands."

GLC_Reel_in_PG_Left_Flank:0 "A Regal Coalition of Nationalist Orthodoxy"
GLC_Reel_in_PG_Left_Flank_desc:0 "The Iron Ring of Bilbao is a set of fortifications and bunkers around the entire Basque territory that was originally meant to defend our lands from possible Communard invasion, but our government has expanded it secretly for years now in case Spain would ever fall into a situation where we could proclaim independence. While nowhere near complete, these labyrinthine constructions could shelter our soldiers and civilians alike should the enemy over the border seek to threaten our freedom."

GLC_Clearing_Up_Confusion:0 "Aristocratic and Populist Vanguard"
GLC_Clearing_Up_Confusion_desc:0 "The Spanish Guardia Civil had many of its troops posted on our lands, and the border with France was manned by some of Spain’s most loyal soldiers. When Alfonso was shot, these troops scrambled for the heartlands of Spain, and only a skeleton crew was left behind to keep us in check, a garrison that we easily defeated when our revolt began. There remains many guns and other weapons in storage, left by the Spaniards, and it would be a sin to leave them to rust in the warehouses. Basque patriots will put them to good use against their former owners."

GLC_Totalism_in_Aesthetics_Only:0 "Totalism in Aesthetics Only"
GLC_Totalism_in_Aesthetics_Only_desc:0 "Ertzana is the local police force of Basques hastily established from those native Guardia Asalto and Guardia Civil troops, who were present here when the instability and chaos engulfed Spain. While merely a militia by the standards of national militaries, these policemen are willing to die for our country and must serve as a first line of defence as we create a proper military force."

GLC_Galician_Right_to_Wine:0 "Defenders of Dionysos' Gift"
GLC_Galician_Right_to_Wine_desc:0 "The government of Euskadi has seen it fit to utilize volunteer tradesmen gathered from both our main parties of EAJ and EAE but also from the trade union ELA to further extend the Iron ring of Bilbao. We cannot build quite as strong fortifications in this short timespan as the main body of the Iron Ring has, but every bunker and trench helps in this difficult situation."

### Events ###
GLC.2.t:0 "Status of Labour Parties in Elections"
GLC.2.d:0 "With Galician independence secured, the provisional government led by Partido Galeguista has announced elections, but with much of the government dominated by conservative figures such as Vicente Risco, Ramon Otero Pedrayo and Xosé Filgueira Valverde, some have questioned whether the socialists of Unión Socialista Galega and the anarchists led by Ricardo Mella would be allowed to take part in the elections. Partido Galeguista itself is in an internal crisis on the matter with the liberals and social democrats within the party calling for the allowing of socialist parties while the conservatives see it as a dangerous and risky move. The Castelao government is struggling to find an answer to the situation, given that the socialists and anarchists supported the rebellion against Spain but also pose a threat to the continued existence of liberal democracy in the new Galician republic. While USG and the anarchists alone most likely do not have the popularity and party outreach to gather the hearts and minds of Galicians to pull a victory, many conservatives especially in Partido Republicano Agrario and Dereita Galeguista have called for immediate protests should the socialist entry into elections be allowed. The precarious political situation in Galicia demands immediate response, and the provisional government must reach an agreement or the situation may cause a worsening crisis."
GLC.2.a:0 "Allow socialist entry into elections."
GLC.2.b:0 "Shelter our liberty from these revolutionary elements."

GLC.3.t:0 "Week of Woes"
GLC.3.d:0 "With our decision to ban the socialists and syndicalists from participating in elections, the local branch of CNT-FAI and its allies in USG have proclaimed nation-wide strikes. While they have been unable to truly halt the Galician economy due to rather large number of non-union workers and the reluctance of non-socialist unions to join their actions, these strikes have nonetheless disrupted the dockyards, fledgling industrial sector and canneries of Galicia, causing some economic setbacks and even brief fisticuffs between anarchists and the paramilitary forces of Vicente Risco and Antonio Losadas, the Irmandades Nazonalista Galego. However, left-leaning members of the Galician political scene, especially the leader of Vangarda Nazionalista Galego, Álvaro de las Casas Blanco, have been vocal in their support for these strikes, calling the ban unconstitutional. Some claim that de las Casas is only using this to attract worker votes for his minor party, and the man does have a rather long and storied past as a populist, but he is not alone. Basílio Álvares, the leader of Galician agrarian movement, has been supportive of the strikers, no doubt because of his interest in agrarian socialism, and while rest of the Galician left-wing scene has been ambivalent or supportive of the line of Partido Galeguista, these two dissident voices have considerably weakened the government position. As such, some of the more hawkish anti-syndicalists in the government have begun to call for a police crackdown on the strikes, seeing the possibility of a revolution as only a matter of time. However, the more moderate members of the provisional government do not see this as a possibility, and in their view, the government can either attempt to negotiate with the strikers to achieve a middle ground, or simply reverse the ban as a sign of goodwill."
GLC.3.a:0 "The ban was a bad idea, we must give in."
GLC.3.b:0 "Perhaps we can negotiate a deal to end the riots without reversing the ban."
GLC.3.c:0 "This is a clear sign of syndicalist agitation for a revolution, crush them!"

GLC.4.t:0 "Crimson Banners Rise Over Galicia"
GLC.4.d:0 "As the Galician police forces were deployed to quell the on-going dockyard and industrial strikes, it soon became apparent that the anarchists under Ricardo Mella and the socialists of USG had come prepared. Police attempts to break the picket lines and drive the workers out from their blockades were met with aggressive counter-attacks, with police batons met with volleys of bricks and stones. Police officers soon found themselves overwhelmed by the strike guards, who had armed themselves with industrial tools, fishing harpoons and even with the few firearms that they had access to, and while the police deployed few of their exceedingly rare Bilbao armoured cars to the scene, they found themselves driven back by improvised firebombs. The worker militias captured revolvers, pistols and Destructor carbines from wounded or surrendering officers, and as the paramilitary groups converged upon the government buildings in areas like Ferrol, A Coruña, Vigo and Lugo, they were met mostly by demoralised and wholly outnumbered groups of former Guardia Civil officers and local policemen. Neither side was particularly interested in shedding blood, but it seemed more and more likely by the moment. The provisional government, watching the situation unfold, was paralysed by indecision, with the workers demanding their immediate surrender or a violent revolution would overthrow the regime either way.

The nationalist paramilitary group Irmandades Nazionalista Galego, trained in secret to face the Spaniards before the Galician independence war, had arrived, led by the eccentric far-right nationalist Vicente Risco and his right-hand man Antonio Losada, and they demanded an immediate disbanding of the revolutionary militias or a full-scale attack by the ING would begin. The proletarian masses, drunk with the newfound power, responded with immediate hostility at the demands of these reactionary nationalists, and a clash occurred between the two forces. The police forces, at least those who had not yet been disarmed, joined the side of the ING, and carnage followed as clashes between the two sides turned into firefights. However, given the lack of firepower and amateurish nature of the two militias, not even the leaders of either movement could tell which side was truly winning, and in the confusing melee, shots and blows were exchanged until one side broke into a rout, sealing the fate of Galicia to the winner’s hands.

The rigours of leadership had been too much for the man, especially considering that he had already had a close brush with the death in 1924 but had survived thanks to the good care Mella had received while in exile in the French Commune. With Mella dead, a young nation in mourning and his funeral plans in full swing, the leadership question of Galician new government has come to the forefront of daily politics, with the provisional chairman of the Confederación Rexional Galaica, Jose Villaverde Velo, announcing that syndicalist elections, similar to those of the French model, would be held to determine who would step into the large shoes left behind by Ricardo Mella. Villaverde may be chosen to lead CRG in the upcoming elections, while Xohán Xesús González has been marked as the leader of the socialist USG. Others, such as the more moderate Federación de Sociedades Gallegas , Agrarias y Culturales of Ramón Suárez Picallo, the feminist Vanguardia Femenina of Urania Mella and the national syndicalist Bloque Social Campesino led by Santiago Montero Díaz have all announced their aim to take part in the elections, though whether they can campaign enough support remains to be seen. The FSGAC represents the interests of peasantry, artisans and craft unionists in Galicia, with ties to Partido Galeguista, and the organisation was originally started in exile but developed into a veritable force in Galicia proper. The BSC is a new entry into Galician politics, with Santiago Montero merging his own admiration of the Spanish national syndicalist Ramiro Ledesma with his long-time fascination with communism to create a nationalist, pluralist and rather authoritarian state, though he vows to respect the status of Galicia as a nation itself. Finally, the free women of Urania Mella represent a break-up between the CRG and the feminist forces, who have grown tired of the paternalistic attitudes of the anarchist cause. The election, while heavily favouring the CRG, is likely to be a contested affair nonetheless, and many fear the future if BSC is able to seize control, but for now, the situation remains stable."

GLC.100.d:0 "The Galician society is in many ways a very traditionalist and backwards culture. There are peasants in these lands who still live in stone buildings that were made in the style their ancestors used during medieval times, there are farmers who use ploughs with designs dating back to Roman times, and there are villages that have never heard of socialism, anarchism or collectivism. There is a blight of the mind afoot in Galicia, and this blight is ignorance, a blight to be fully rooted out. Thankfully, with the revolution complete and the territory of Galicia under Ricardo Mella’s benevolent rule, these relics of the past can be finally pushed aside so that a new society can rise in its place. The Galician people must be taught the simple paradigm of our thought, the great ideals of Ricardo Mella. To him, collectivism is the sole guiding principle capable of bringing true liberty to the people, rejecting communism in the name of freedom and rejecting individualism in the name of solidarity.\n\nThe collectivist model of Mella affirms that the man is an absolute master of his work, and humanity is the absolute sovereign of the productive forces of nature. By giving humanity and man their due can collectivism be achieved. The new collectivist society of Galicia will emphasize freedom of the individual as part of a greater society, allowing them to create and produce without overbearing instructions and pressure from the state. Where certain societal functions and tasks are in need of doing, but remain beyond the means of individuals to fulfill on their own, the associations, unions and other groups will develop to complete these tasks, with free association at the centre of the function of these organisations.\n\nThe new anarchist society will not take from the individual what is their due, but instead provide them the economic state in which they can best fulfill themselves in a way that it benefits both them and the society at large, and as the ultimate sign of the newfound Galician liberty, these men will be able to freely choose whether it is their place to remain as part of the society or to depart it and harvest the sweat of their brow to themselves alone. While many ideologies and groups may bear the name of collectivism, it is only Mella’s original brainchild that shall ensure the upholding of true prosperity for all without ruthless oversteps."

The charlatans and fanatics of the old order shall be swept from their redoubts in churches and atheneums, until only those with the best interests of the people on their minds can lead people towards salvation. Once this collapse of faith is complete, and the smoke and mirrors of Christianity is brushed aside, the mind of Galicians shall become fertile soil for immortal human development.\n\nHeroes of the revolutionary struggle of the past and today will be celebrated, to be formed as an ideal to follow in the future, and the bankruptcy of beliefs brought about by the destruction of primitive faiths will be replaced with the true path to individual freedom and rationalist liberty. The leadership under Mella understands that for the average Galician peasant, this will be a terrifying journey, one that involves the complete dismantling of everything that once constituted their worldview, and as such, they may feel the need to rebel, to contest the future proclaimed by Mellistas.\n\nBut for the good of mankind, and more specifically in the contest of Galicia, for the good of the Galicians themselves, the new anarchist cause must continue to sign the hymns of liberty and educate the people through free and widespread educational institutions build in villages and towns throughout the nation. Once the average peasant has the means to learn, without pressure and coercion from a state or religious entity, it is hoped that they will do so out of curiosity and genuine wish. Perhaps this will finally dispel the fears that come from the end of the Catholic era. After all, as Mella puts it, there is no sunset without a sunrise."

However, while the collapse of the regime itself was bloodless, the anarchists and socialists of the new regime have been quick to mete chaotic justice upon landlords and rich business owners, these bandits in crimson cloaks were soon dealt with. However, with these measures came the question of just how revolutionary Mella’s new Galicia would be, and to that, the father of Galician anarchism already had an answer.\n\nTo him, the age old question of evolution versus revolution in left-wing political circles was not a question in itself, as Mella’s view on the matter was that they are not a direct answer to every situation but instead revolution is but a mere addition to evolution. The societal, political and economical realities of the current situation would determine the response, and only a revolution born out of essential ideals could bring about a just and equal society, instead of aggravating the Caesarianism of states.\n\nEvolution is an implacable, ever creeping force to Mella, which has throughout history removed despots born from absolutism in place of constitutional monarchs, disposed monarchs for parliamentary republics, brought slaves into serfdoms and serfs into proletariat, and in due time, will produce a society in which men are equal and the old forms of government are forgotten as the utopia of Anarchy sets in. Mella’s revolutions exist where they are needed, as part of the evolution towards anarchy, not as a separate process from it.\n\nJust like nature’s great mountain chains grow slowly over millenia, they can sometimes be quickly changed following a volcanic eruption, and such is also the role of revolutions. As such, with Galicia under his grip, the new anarchist territory will undergo the transformation towards anarchy not through a blanket revolutionary mentality but by allowing regional circumstances to determine the rapidity of the evolution"

This is what Ricardo Mella asked already in 1906, when the dreams of anarchism in Galicia were but mere lofty dreams of a committed man and his close circle. For many Galicians, they ring true just as hard today as they did during those years, and for all the talk of equality, liberty and progress that the republic of Spain espoused during its few years of existence, nothing seemed to change.\n\nThe Spanish monarchy, disinterested in the plight of the common man, was completely complacent as millions starved and fought among each other for a scrap of food or a piece of bread, and the republicans simply replaced this unfeeling crowned noble with a new buffoon to worship. As time has passed, the moniker the ruling caste has held has of course changed, but true change for the men and women with empty stomachs and weary bodies has never occured. The people yearn nothing more than to have enough bread to live by, a roof over their head and work to give them a purpose, and yet, the caste that holds all the power, the inquisition of the sated, cares little for them, inventing distractions and deceitful ideologies born from the arch-deceiver itself, the civilisation, to keep the people huddled in their misery.\n\nThis caste holds no more power over Galicia now, and as long as Mella’s old body allows him to, he will ensure that the illusions crafted by the state will hold no meaning in Galicia, and only once every human being on this wayward province has had their base needs met, can society again consider things like science and art worth pursuing. But these luxuries must not come at the cost of the average man, but instead they shall supplement the existence of the liberated spirit no longer yearning for a warm meal every waking hour of their lives."

However, much work remains to be done, and Ricardo Mella’s Nueva Utopia calls the loyal sons of the CRG to fulfill. In his dreams, Mella sees a Galicia of the common man, crafted by those uncouth and rough men who have toiled the lands and braved the seas of the Atlantic coast for millenia. A Galicia of the worker, not led by the idle priests, the greedy masters, the bloodthirsty military men or the red-clad tyrants. In Mella’s vision, a new Galicia will transform everything from societal traditions to city structures.\n\nA new Galicia, built from stone and concrete, will have cities with dedicated housing districts, factory districts, bustling market and most importantly, space for people to live and work freely. Gone are the cramped and noisy cities of the past, replaced with wide streets, large gardens separating buildings from one another, innovations of modernity such as electric stations and water pumps providing for all the needs of the Galicians. The entire city is transformed into a celebration of humanity and its ingenuity, its magnificent ability to create and toil for the community. The industrial sector houses billowing chimneys and gigantic machines that toil day and night to provide for the people, employing fewer and fewer workers as automation becomes the aim for industrial development.\n\nOn a societal level, the people of Galicia are educated to abandon the need to police the actions of others, so that individuals can live their lives without being policed by their peers into living a life of servitude towards the societal conventions and taboos. The superstitions of the past are banished in the great atheneums of the new era, which house the encyclopaedic knowledge of the human race and transfer ás much of this knowledge as humanely possible onto the generations of the future.\n\nThis will allow children to pursue their desired course of life, perhaps producing unequal results but with the same capabilities given to them by the society from which they sprang forth. The new societal model produces a new man, a renegade among humanity, who fights in co-operation with his comrades so that the new state of being is brought to all mankind to share. The painful reality of the matter is that the fading health of Ricardo Mella will not allow him to see this transformation happen, and he has fully come to accept it, but thanks to his efforts in Galicia, the first seeds of this New Utopia have been sown."

Mella has long been highly critical of the so called ‘illegalists’, who utilize the anarchist theory of propaganda of the deed as justification to steal, rob and murder perceived enemies. In the eyes of Mella, they are merely continuing the regimes of spoliation and oppression that the revolutionary order was aimed to overthrow, and a true anarchist society has no place for such chaotic and violent excesses.\n\nMella considers violence at best an unfortunate last straw of an anarchist uprising, and in times of peace, the society of the anarchists is one of freedom and solidarity between men, not one where those with the power can exert their dominance over others through the barrel of a gun. Wrapping murderous intent into an ideological justification makes it no less condemnable, and in the new Galicia, such acts of wanton violence will receive their fair punishment from the communal courts."

Galician anarchists as a whole have been relatively hesitant to take part in the violent actions of the Catalan and Andalusian counterparts, and while there have been those especially within the circle headed by José Moreno that called for a more direct and violent struggle against state and capitalism, Villaverde has for the most part managed to contain the most excessive outbursts of anarchism in Galicia.\n\nHowever, while the CRG chairman has been a strong ally of the Spanish moderate anarchist wing headed by the likes of Ángel Pestaña, Joan Peiró and Salvador Seguí, he never officially joined the project of Pestaña to establish a legitimate anarcho-syndicalist party in Spain. With Galicia under the anarchist masses now, Villaverde has abandoned his previous hesitancy towards the matter, and the union has been transformed into a party-union hybrid, influenced by the ideas of Seguí and the French unionist movements, with the idea of participating in elections and maintaining legitimacy through democratic means. Villaverde has also adopted Pestaña’s ideas on mass action, where the societal revolution would be carried out on the streets through immense agitation, social work and constant organisation of the workers, until one day all the remnants of inequality and capitalist system are washed away thanks to the sheer popular will.\n\nThis popular will shall also be harnessed against the gravest threat to all moderate anarchists, the reactionary and revolutionary tyrants and despots of the world. Under Villaverde and his new vision for CRG, Galicia shall rise to become a bastion of liberty, denouncing the conservatives and nationalists of the right as well as the red-tinted butchers of national syndicalism alike, and should they ever attempt to destroy the newfound freedom of Galicia, they will become the target of the liberated people’s divine wrath.

In fact, the union has struggled to conquer the mainland itself, with many agrarian societies aligning more closely with parties such as ORGA, Partido Galeguista and the left-wing agrarians of Basilio Álvarez.\n\nMuch of CRG’s support comes from the coastal towns and cities of Ferrol, A Coruña and Vigo, with the federal unions Federación Regional Marítima, Sindicato El Despertar Marítimo and Sindicato de Industria Pesquera pulling in nearly half of the entire wider union’s membership. Given Galicia’s lack of industry, many fishermen and sailors have began to pressure the leadership of the union, especially the ruling chairman José Villaverde Velo, into taking a more active role in marine affairs. José Moreno and Claro José Sendón, noted troublemakers within the CRG known for advocating for a far more revolutionary and violent turn within the union, have been calling for Villaverde to take action and utilise the talents of the Galician maritime fleet to help the wider Internationale in their struggle for the international revolution.\n\nMonero and Sendón posit that Galicians could use their fleet to covertly attack capitalist shipping, becoming in essence red pirates of yore, pulling from the tradition of Galician corsairs such as Buenaventura Marcó del Pont Bori and Benito Soto Aboal, though with far less self-serving greed and far more revolutionary necessity. According to the pair of radicals, and their rather enthusiastic supporters among the various naval unions, the best way for Galicia to contribute is to arm its merchant ships and use them as raiders against the pillagers, for all goods destined for places like Hamburg, Fiume and Algiers would better serve the revolution here and in the three large Internationale nations. However, such actions would cause repercussions from foreign powers, and Galicia does not possess a great fleet of actual warships to defend itself with, despite the efforts of the Ferrol shipyards.

This mineral is tungsten, and due to its incredible hardness and various other qualities, such as unparalleled heat resistance, a further refined tungsten carbide is used in construction and metalworking. It is also very important to the war efforts of various nations, as tungsten can be utilised in different types of artillery ammunition, typically in the form of armour-piercing composite rigid rounds, where a tank or field gun shell has a tungsten core meant to pierce enemy armour through sheer kinetic energy alone.\n\nIn addition to its offensive use, it is also used as a compound for various highly sophisticated or effective tools and materials. The large powers of Europe have been quick to utilise the material to its maximum capacity in their war machines, but this new ‘Wolfram fever’ ,as the hunt for more tungsten has been colloquially called, has taken a completely new turn lately. The German empire, with its global empire of exploitation, has been sourcing its tungsten from the Chinese concessions and its client state of Burma, but with the Chinese warlords returning to their warlike ways and the German colonial holdings in Asia increasingly threatened by the Japanese, the source of German tungsten may very well be at risk. On European soil, only two nations possess a great deal of tungsten to this day, first and most important being the Kingdom of Portugal, and second being Spain. However, with Galician independence, we have now inherited over seventy percent of Spanish tungsten thanks to the Mines of San Finx.\n\nNeedless to say, the Communards have been incredibly interested in this bounty, and the CRG government is more than happy to deliver, but first, the numerous issues with the mines have to be addressed. The living conditions of workers are abhorrent, with the original English administration of the mines from the company, San Finx Tin Mines Limited, completely ignoring the damages caused by the particles released from the mining of the material, which caused silicosis in the workers. Similarly, smuggling and rowdy behaviour is a daily woe in the camp, because there is not enough housing and even living space for the numerous workers.\n\nWith further funding coming from the Internationale to restart the mining operations, of course aided by the fact that there is no longer good-for-nothing owners skimming most of the profits to line their pockets, perhaps the mines can finally offer their bounty without compromising the well-being of the miners. With their help, the inevitable war with the Kaiserreich is bound to be an easy one, with the Galician tungsten effortlessly piercing the Panzers of Wilhelm in battle. "

However, like her father, Mella has never been afraid to voice her discomfort with the way things are run in Galicia, and ever since the revolutionary victory against the bands of Risco and the feeble bourgeois republic, she has been pushing CRG and other left-wing parties to actually honour their promises for the women of Galicia. When the provisional revolutionary government did not react to her calls quickly enough, Mella broke with CRG and founded her own anarcha-feminist organisation known as Vanguardia Femenina, which has since gained a following among those women of Galicia who feel that the main union and various other parties are not doing enough for the cause of female emancipation.\n\nRecognising the threat of splintering, chairman Villaverde and various other union leaders from regional branches, such as the agrarian leader Ezequiel Rey Turnes and Robustiano Collazo Álvarez, director of the Sindicato de Industria Pesquera, have convened on the topic of women’s unionism. These leaders of Galician anarchism came to the conclusion that unless the syndicates started to compromise with Mella’s view, it would create increased rivalry among the feminists and regular syndicalists, and given that a large part of CRG is women, the repercussions could be immense. In a time when CRG faces unprecedented rivalry from other left-wing parties such as Unión Socialista Galega and Bloque Social Campesino, Mella’s organisation could be our downfall.\n\nAs such, the chairmen of the various federal unions agreed upon further negotiations with Mella to bring the Vanguardia Femenina back under CRG control, or at the very least, into a coalition with it. Initial negotiations with Mella were relatively tense, with the feminist propagandist very aware of her better negotiation position, but eventually a compromise was reached, and VF was integrated as the women’s section of CRG after large concessions were made on the part of Villaverde and various other union leaders.

The first one to land such a blow from our wayward province was Antonio Soto, known accurately as ‘El Gallego Soto’ in his adopted homeland of Argentina, or perhaps more fittingly, Patagonia, where he now stands as the leader of the Patagonian Workers’ Front, fighting against the Buenos Aires regime. The exploits of Soto allowed for the Patagonian workers to drive back their overlords in La Anita farm during the Second Patagonian Strike, but Soto had been active in anarchist politics since his teenager years, and participated in labour battles against the authorities from a young age.\n\nIt may appear surprising that Soto is such a prominent figure in Argentine syndicalist politics, but in truth, many Argentinian socialist and syndicalist figures can draw their ancestry to the Galician immigrants, and many current leaders of their cause are direct Catalan or Galician first-generation immigrants, driven to the New World by the crackdowns of dictator Primo de Rivera and later on, the one-party rule that followed the Sanjurjada coup. Now, Argentina has languished under a dictator not much different from the Spanish caudillo, with their Manuel Carlés, whose political program seeks to squash any rights of the workers.\n\nSoto’s resistance mirrors our fight for recognition, and thus large diplomatic cooperation has begun with the Patagonian workers, with some Galician syndicalist leaders even floating the idea of forming a volunteer battalion to be sent to fight in Patagonia, though this was quickly shot down since the Madridian threat is too large for us to contest. Still, Soto has become something of a folk hero to the new Galician syndicalist order, and propaganda posters bearing his face are seen at street corners and bulletin boards throughout the cities of Galicia, almost as frequently as those of the independence war’s martyrs or the venerable Galician anarchist Ricardo Mella. The Argentine connection is an inspiration for Galician syndicalists and as long as Soto’s struggle continues, the homeland will stand in support for the Patagonian workers to the bitter end."

However, despite the utopian vision of Mella, there are realities to the Galician experience with anarcho-syndicalism that makes this imaginary future rather unbelievable in the eyes of the conventional unionists of the Atlantic coast. Instead of being hell-bent on creating factories and urban planning marvels, we must focus on creating a better life in accordance of the Galician life.\n\nFrom the small hamlets of fishermen to the idyllic rural villages of central Galicia, CRG representatives must abandon lofty ideals of massive churning cities with districts for different forms of production and leisure, and instead focus on improving the existing infrastructure, dismantling sources of inequality and expanding the tools available to the peasants, fishermen and artisans of the territory. That way, we do not alienate the common people, many of whom still view us with suspicion due to their religious nature and reliance on local elite, and instead show them the fruits of anarcho-syndicalism in action.\n\nThe new utopia promoted by CRG and its leader, chairman Villaverde, is one that respects the age-old tradition of Galicia with a modernising touch, but without the rather excessively transformative idealism of Mella. Perhaps one day this noble land is industrialised to such degree that Mella’s vision can be put into reality, but for now, the Nova Utopia of our greatest syndicalist hero will be tweaked and downgraded to such a degree that it can be reliably achieved."

While CRG is hardly supportive of a Galician nation state, the union’s leaders have began to look into the wider Galician diaspora with dreams of unification.\n\nAfter all, so many within the Galician diaspora left Europe after the various capitalist exploitations ruined the economy of our province, and many emigres were young, working age men of anarchist or socialist leanings.\n\nThese union leaders, especially those with ties to the New World such as the returning Galicianist syndicalist Ernesto Atanasio Janeiro, Orencio Abalde Rodríguez and Desiderio Comesaña Prado, founder of the Sociedad Obrera de Cultura and Ateneo Obrero de Divulgación Social, have been promoting unity with the wider Galician diaspora, especially with Argentina.\n\nThey posit that the Galician community overseas is already in some ways anarchist in its nature, with its local communities and interest groups rescinding their Galician nationalist identity towards the establishment of a Galician national state, focusing more on serving the interests of the Galicians in their local communities instead, promoting collaboration between all types of ideological Galician diaspora members for the sake of finding a common ground for the Galician people.\n\nThis has led to curious situations where liberals, conservatives, socialists and anarchists have banded under the common flag to pursue the best possible outcomes for Galicians in their new home. As such, supporters of this unity with the diaspora promote a highly decentralised, anational entity which would support Galician communities all around the globe without a state. However, many are not convinced, claiming that such focus towards the Galician people, even if not inherently statist, would be a grave insult to the international workers’ movement and its aim for an united Earth without needless distinctions between peoples."

However, now that the fighting has subsided, many militias have been disbanded or merged into the newly established Galician army, but with the anarcho-syndicalists in control of the local government, many have began to demand that the army be either completely abolished or at least heavily decentralised so that another hierarchic vestige of the state is weakened.\n\nInstead, CRG leadership and especially capable military men such as the famed Leonese guerilla Marcelino de la Parra as well as our homegrown FAI member and main militia commander José Moreno, have argued that instead of a centralised military, Galician forces should be formed into local defense groups known milicias confederais. These militias would oversee different sections of Galicia during times of war, focusing on securing their own local villages, municipalities and towns from enemy attack, committing to guerilla warfare if an area is occupied or integrating themselves into wider battle columns if the battlefield necessities call for it.\n\nSimilarly, the entire military structure will undergo a degree of reorganisation, with chain of command becoming more democratic as officers are voted for by the men who serve under their leadership. More conservative or statist officers have voiced concerns that this will break the quality of the officer corps as now leaders of entire platoons and companies can be chosen based solely on how good of a crowd pleaser they are, yet many consider it a better test of leadership if the officers can be kicked out through popular vote instead of having to go through military bureaucracy.\n\nThere is still a degree of debate on whether women should be allowed to hold a rank within the army, with supporters of this noting the example of Esperanza Rodríguez Gómez, a captain of the Milicias Populares Galegas during the independence war, as well as many women fighters who rose up during the war spontaneously to battle for the fate of Galicia free from Spain. Traditional gender roles have influenced many within the critics of this changed, but some have also noted that the women’s role as supporters to the war effort is too important to change for the sake of getting more bodies to the frontlines."

Whether it is through the creation of stable and functional new state or the cultural evolution of budding second Rexurdimento into a blooming flower of new Galician golden era, the Galicianist movement of all shades and ideological leanings will have decades worth of inspiration from our victory. However, with independence of Galicia, there has been a considerably more prominent shift in the two constituent parts of Galicianism. The young patriots of Galicia are completely electrified from the independence, and have been driven into a frenzy of patriotism, holding rallies, political gatherings and impromptu nationalist celebrations all over our great nation.\n\nWhile the old guard of Galicianism was originally enthusiastic about this national rejuvenation, they have become somewhat critical of this fervour, claiming that the youth reformism is pushing the ideological background of Galicianism into avenues it was never meant for. However, despite the inherent conservative and traditionalist leanings of Antón Losada Diéguez, the president of Galicia, he has been an outspoken supporter of this young patriotic expression. Losada views it as a means to push Galicianism further, to light the fire within even the oldest political chieftains so that the love of our young nation can transform it to ever greater heights. To Losada, the young hearts of Galicia will carry the flag with such pride that it allows for an ever more rapid realization of our national ideals, and thus it is not only the task of the youth to carry out, but an obligation of the old guard to also adopt a similar mindset.\n\nThe Old Guard, who laid the seeds of Galicianism into the fertile soil of Galicia must now rejuvenate the movement in accord with the new patriots, so that one day, these brave idealists are prepared to take the reins themselves. What Galicianism has already achieved is rather remarkable, but in Losada’s vision, it is not enough to be content with what has already been achieved, but in what the movement can create if it is supported to the utmost capacity that Galicia can muster."

But where works of Dante and Leopardi are dear to his heart and above the works of German contemporaries in a rather considerable margin, Losada’s love for the peasantry of Galicia finds no equal even in these great works of literature. To him, the peasants of Galicia are not just the inhabitants of the land, but its soul and spirit, as directly tied to it as the crops they grow, the mountains they live amongst and the sea that washes the rocks of Galician coast every minute of every day. Losada ties this belonging of the peasants to the Galician language, and posits that the central peculiarity of Galician is its great assortment of words related to farming, the eternal tradition of our lands.\n\nThe city dwellers may have their own ideals and traditions, but their ways do not come close to the primordial culture of the Galician village, and thus, with Partido Republicano Agrario fully in control, the cities will be forced to relinquish their dastardly grip upon the rural countrysides, so that the true soul of Galicia no longer languished under the dominance of urban elites. Villages, rural roads and other infrastructure will be the main source of development programs, while national holidays celebrating the seasonal changes will be created to venerate the ancient profession.\n\nCultural programs will be opened in villages and rural towns so that the lowliest peasant or tenant farmer of Galicia will have access to the pearls of Galicianism, and agrarian improvement programs will be performed with the help of local scientific institutions so that the toilers of our native land can have the best possible means to work the earth. It is hoped that these measures will truly light the fire of Galicianism in the hearts of the peasantry, and make them realize just how much this fair land is the creation of their century-old traditions and ways of life, just as Losada has realized during his life."

GLC.152.d:0 "After the right-wing agrarians took power in Galicia, one of the central tenets of the party soon evolved to be the dismantling of the artificiality of modern life. For too long had mankind been deceived with the ideal that to be modern and create progress in society, a society needed to direct more and more towards centralisation, large cities, big industrial complexes and uniformity of nationalities. The Galician agrarians reject this notion. The currency societal conflict, a social war between the workers and capitalists, stems from this very problem, for the workers are forced into large lifeless cities, and the capitalists see only profit to be had in larger and larger production lines and manufactories. The societal order is so intertwined with this development trajectory, that if the workers were to overthrow the capitalist ruling class, they would achieve very little, for the industrial nation would still remain and simply create new rulers demanding more and more production.\n\nGalician nationalism, as it stands, is against these delusions of true progress, and wishes that a society could return to a more natural state, one where the smog-filled cities and tight living quarters are instead viewed as the entrapments of a world run by capital and greed, not the true progress of mankind. A true paradise of the Galicianists is the verdant and fertile rural lands of this beautiful province, and the lifeblood of the movement stems not from the cities and factories but from the humble peasant villages. As such, massive efforts have been put into achieving a larger traffic towards a more rural life, with an expansion on land sales towards single-family farmers, with compensation paid to the landowners, as well as the hiring of agricultural experts, who are able to determine where more arable land could be found.\n\nHowever, president Losada and his supporters do realize that a modern nation cannot run without factories to some extent, and thus programs have been started that would see the expansion of a more naturalised city infrastructure. Given the low amount of industrialisation in Galicia, this should be relatively easy to achieve. The goal of the entire large scale transformation is to alter the consciousness of Galicians, to abandon economic development as the only worthwhile cause in the world, so that they may embrace God’s wonderful creations on Earth."

GLC.153.d:0 "The Galician cause for independence does have its own martyrs and heroes, but when compared to its Catalan and Basque counterparts, violent resistance towards Madrid rule was rather rare until it exploded in the revolt against the Castillans not too long ago. As such, while Partido Republicano Agrario has erected monuments for the heroes of this resistance war, there are other martyred souls not related directly to the Galician fight for freedom who have also received a curious tribute from Antón Losada and his party. One such figure has been Terence MacSwiney, former mayor of Cork and hero of the Irish independence, who Losada aims to honour with a statue of his own in one of the larger cities of Galicia. A man Losada has revered since the Easter Rising in Ireland, MacSwiney to Losada represents the face of human persistence and resistance that is not driven by momentary fervour but from a deep nationalist sentiment.\n\nIn Losada’s eyes, nationalism in this world is often born from force and interest of various factions, not because it comes from a deep love for the fatherland but because it benefits one group or another. This type of nationalism is thus worthless compared to one that comes from the adoration of one’s place of birth and the stubbornness to see the region freed, as MacSwiney demonstrated. Having been imprisoned for his beliefs, MacSwiney was left to rot in prison and eventually starved to death, but every torturous moment in that slow decay was, in Losada’s eyes, spent to ensure that the nation MacSwiney revered would one day be free.\n\nIt is this immense spiritual fortitude that Losada deeply admires, and in these post-independence days, when Galicia returns to a degree of normality and seeks to assert itself as a member of the global network of nation states, Losada seeks to emphasize and usher in an era of spiritual nationalism, unbending in the most difficult times, so that every man and woman in this beautiful land may have the tools needed to give their all so that the white and blue flag may wave over the Atlantic coast forevermore."

GLC.154.d:0 "Galicia has never been a real cradle of Carlism unlike regions such as Basque Country, Navarra and Andalusia, but the traditionalist movement has nonetheless had some influence in the region. Before his nationalist and republican turn, president Losada was a Carlist himself, and his status as a large landowner and wealthy nobleman made him one of the key supporters of the cause in this wayward region. Given their immense hatred for the Madrid Alfonsists and deep-rooted belief in local autonomy, or fueros, the Galician Carlists for the most part supported the war against Spain, with some notable exceptions such as Jesus Cora y Lira, one of the main supporters of Carlos Pio for a Carlist pretender.\n\nThe movement has never been particularly interested in democracy or republicanism, but even during republican years, numerous Carlists participated in elections and sought to influence the new system to adopt more Carlist-adjacent ideological leanings without the need for a Carlist uprising. With Losada’s moderate traditionalist party in the rise in Galicia, many Carlists have been attracted to it, some even outright joining it such as the moderate Carlist militant Manuel Cerezales González and the eccentric José María Castroviejo. However, this recent influx of Carlists into the party of Losada has made some question whether he plans to install a Carlist monarchy here in Galicia now that the party holds power, though Losada himself has been adamant on his republican positions.\n\nNonetheless, some of the Carlists have suggested that the party adopts a more traditionalist line of thinking alongside its agrarian and nationalist ideals. This would be a rather moderate form of Integrism, a Spanish variation on the Lusitanian integralism which espouses a radically decentralized, deeply pious and politically accidentalist form of traditionalism. Losada himself has been relatively hesitant to pursue this direction, but there is some degree of support among the various cliques of PRA towards such an ideological renewal."

GLC.155.d:0 "A key part of president Losada’s program for Galicia is his aim to Galicianize the Church and Christianize Galicia. In his view, the nationalism of Galicia is a force that can rejuvenate the local church, so long reeling under the influence of the wider Spanish Catholic community. Similarly, in his view, a Galicia that does not seek spiritual unity brought about by a strong Catholic society is doomed to fall for the predations of larger nations, such as Portugal and Spain. As such, Galician church will be detached as heavily as possible from the Spanish church, made easier by the fact that many high-ranking Spanish administrators and clergymen escaped the region following the uprising against Madrid, and some, such as the reigning archbishop, had been assassinated by revolutionary reds.\n\nWith the rise of Fernado Quiroga, a local Galician member of the clergy, to the position of archbishop of Santiago, it would appear that Losada’s first step in the plan is well in motion, and Partido Republicano Agrario has expended considerable funds setting up seminary schools and other facilities for church personnel training here in Galicia, hoping to attract further local recruits to supplement or replace Spaniards. Similarly, programs aimed at renovating or expanding existing infrastructure of the church in various parishes, as well as repairing damage caused by the war and the following political chaos, have been begun all around the nation, with the aim of creating jobs as well as bringing people closer to the church. Under Losada’s rule, the Galician way of life will become as tied to religion as possible, and religion shall become as tied to the nationalist cause of PRA as possible.\n\nThe process will take ages, of course, and much of the clergy will obviously resist these changes, but without such drastic alteration of the church, we will forever have to deal with a rebellious priestly class aligned with the false shepherds of Madrid. The most fervent Catholics in the party have even suggested that to truly create a Catholic Galicia worthy of God’s grace, we should follow a similar model to the Andorran co-prince system, where the member of the lay politicians serve as the head of government while the archbishop of Santiago shall serve as the nominal head of state.

The caciques of Galicia, who have for so long dominated the politics of rural villages and towns, shall receive no mercy in the matter, with their ill-begotten goods and hoarded lands being redistributed to the poorest populations of Galicia or pushed into programs aimed at creating traditionalist welfare around the nation.\n\nNo longer can these political playboys dominate the nation’s politics through their corruption and thuggish tactics, and those who have not had the good sense to flee shall be expelled or imprisoned for their past actions.

However, a factor which sets Losada apart from his liberal counterparts was his readiness to use force for the independence of Galicia, with Losada’s training with the militias of Irmandades Nazionalista Galego to ensure that if the time would ever come, Galicians would be ready to fight for the freedom of their land. The Irmandades fought alongside the more ad hoc militias of the nation during the war for independence, and their exploits are the stuff of legends that will inspire the newly established Galician army for decades to come, but as the importance of ING grows, so does the influence of its most famed member. Losada may have been the man behind much of the organisation and training of the paramilitary group, but over the years, his close ally and friend Vicente Risco has grown to exert more and more power within the militia group.\n\nCurrently, while Losada and other members of the ING still command much respect within the group, it has developed to become little more than the personal tool of posturing for Risco as he attempts to push his own, very eccentric if not borderline esoteric agendas on the young Galician state. If Losada and the other more moderate members of the ING, such as Valentin Paz, are to allow Risco to continue his nonsense, there is no telling when he earns enough power to become more than a nuisance. While he is a respected writer and politician, Risco is too prone to extremist ideas to be allowed to do his own thing without supervision, though some argue that he should be kicked out altogether because he is a liability and an easy talking point to the enemies of PRA to use as a political tool.

The Carlist allies of Losada Dieguez have solidly aligned with the nationalists of Vicente Risco on the party’s right flank, but they are far from hegemonic, and a new clique of liberals has risen in the party’s left. While not left-leaning enough to align with the socialist and progressive agrarians of Basilio Álvarez, they are nonetheless committed to the liberation of Galician peasants and the protection of rural values, and while the leader of the faction, Leandro Pita Romero, is a man of deep liberal convictions, he has been a member of the group since its inception.\n\nWhile Losada generally agrees with the right flank of the grouping more, Pita’s influence on the economic program of the group cannot be understated, for his leadership role in the agrarian association Asociación Xeral de Gandeiros de Galicia has given him immense experience with the peculiarities and unique quirks of Galician agriculture. Pita’s civic profession as a lawyer has given him a great skillset on the political field as well, allowing us to better persecute the various political cliques left over from the collapse of Count Romanones’ empire of greed. Pita’s association with the liberal centrist politician Manuel Portela Valladares, a member of the Spanish liberal core, has also given him far more sway among the Spanish liberals of Galicia than his rivals in parties like Partido Galeguista and ORGA.\n\nPortela Valladares may not have the national name recognition of figures such as Alejandro Lerroux or Manuel Azaña, but he is nonetheless an influential liberal within Galicia, well capable of bridging the divide between Spaniards and Galicians, and thus Pita’s association with him could be a boon by itself. However, Pita himself is among the most versatile members of PRA, obviously mostly focused on legal matters, agricultural and livestock issues as well as economic ones, but his talents reach well beyond these. Pita has worked as a writer and editor for numerous magazines throughout Galicia, and his mastery of the press could certainly support PRA’s cause. Thus, while met with increased complaints from the party’s right, Pita’s success as a member of PRA has been rather important for the continued influx of liberals into the organization."

However, PRA under Losada is in the unenviable position where it is still small party, and a triumph in elections means little if Losada and his allies are unable to forge a distinct identity and political position within the Galician ideological battlefield. However, to maintain the party’s grip on power, the question of alliances has been risen once more, and numerous possibilities have been brought forth.\n\nOn the surface level, allying with the progressive agrarians of Basilio Álvarez might appear like the most logical solution, but these agrarians are known to be rather radical in nature and Álvarez himself has associated with both the arch-devil Alejandro Lerroux as well as the communists of Beningo Álvarez. Nonetheless, at least on matters of economy and agrarian development, there is common ground to be found between our parties. Next logical group would be the nationalist conservatives of Dereita Galeguista, but their main drawback is the rather shifty loyalties of DG.\n\nMany rumours indicate that their true allegiance is not with A Coruña but with Madrid.

Finally, the conservative liberals and Christian nationalists of Otero Pedrayo are an option, though many within PRA hold them in contempt for their liberalism and academic nature.

Many within the cultural circles of Galicia consider him a man of immense potential, perhaps one of the few who could truly eclipse the literature giant of the right, Ramón Otero Pedrayo, yet it is as if de las Casas himself is set to sabotage his prospects at every turn. His inconsistent leanings, his seemingly never-ending flexibility and the ever-driving need to be in the spotlight have made him appear opportunistic and shifty to many, not to mention his nature as a man of eternal contradictions.\n\nDe las Casas is seemingly  a man of the left, supporting socialist and left-wing republican ideals of federalism and anti-caciquismo, economic redistribution and various other programs in consort with communists and moderate socialists. Yet others claim that he is indeed merely a conservative masquerading as a progressive, pointing to his days as a monarchist, soldier in the Rif war and his many dealings with the likes of Dereita Galeguista’s leadership and Vicente Risco, conservatives or traditionalists to the bone. He is simultaneously a strong defender of the republican ideal, having given back his honours to the Spanish crown before becoming an avid conspirator to see the Bourbons overthrown, yet he also perceives aristocracy as the ultimate system in many ways.\n\nA snobbish upstart to some, a dangerous populist radical to others and yet a man of great cultural merit and potential to most despite these qualities, de las Casas is a mixture of his eccentric beliefs and seems to change his ideals whenever it suits him the best. But for all his opportunism and shrewd political eye, de las Casas possesses a singular characteristic which has made him the darling of the post-independence Galicia. The leader of VNG was, to the very end of the monarchy’s futile effort to maintain control over Iberia, an independentist, who would stop at nothing to see the verdant hillsides and groves of Galiza freed from the barbaric rule of the Spaniards."

Given his highly impressionable character, de las Casas has always been drawn to political movements that present themselves in flamboyant and extravagant fashion. It is thus no large surprise that during his recent visit to the Commune of France, despite his rather moderate stance on left-wing policies, de las Casas was quickly enthralled by the audiovisual extravaganza with which the Communard organisations presented themselves. While the mass demonstrations and abrupt avant-garde visuals of the French syndicalists, anarchists and Jacobins mesmerized the Galician populist, there was no contest on the group that left the largest impression on the foreigner.\n\nThe Sorelians, with their militant parades, aggressive rhetoric and especially their use of flags, banners, ribbons and various other paraphernalia associated with the movement was enough to make de las Casas a committed Sorelian, at least for a little while. However, after returning to Galicia, he found the local Totalists dull and far too much of an academic local clique, and quickly abandoned all hopes of shaping a true Sorelian movement here in Iberia. His moderation would return, but the memory of the grand parades in Paris never truly left him, and de las Casas has thus far sought to emulate all that he saw in the Internationale’s beating heart in the small towns and cities of Galicia. Ultreyas march on the streets to the beat of drums, large banners with political slogans and big promises etched to them flying over this group of Galician youth. New uniforms with plenty of medals and commemorative ribbons have been made for the finest supporters of Álvaro de las Casas, and even the president himself tends to adorn as many trinkets and tokens on his suits whenever representing his nation, much to the amusement or, more often, bemusement of foreign dignitaries.\n\nMany within and outside of Galicia find the maximalist visuals of the party at odds with the relatively vague and modest political platform it espouses, but to the moderates of Galicia, this is seen as a respite from the on-going radicalisation globally. Perhaps VNG is the Totalist trajectory purpose-built for Galicia, to contain the worst impulses of the Internationale’s totalitarians by converting their movements into little more than visual and auditive noise in the Galician context. But to the supporters of VNG and the Ultreyas, the new representation of the movement of de las Casas is a breath of fresh air, bringing much needed dynamism and youthful enthusiasm to the often stale and predictable Galician political scene."

However, one union that has recently pledged its wholehearted support for de las Casas and his VNG is the winemakers’ platform Unión de Cosecheros del Ribero de Avia. The reason for this sudden show of support stems from de las Casas’ long-lasting love for the town of Ribero, where he has a large estate acquired years ago when he was still actively working in Argentina.\n\nThe Riberan estate was his primary holiday home, and during his long stays in the region, he became acutely aware of the plight of the viticultural workers and employers in the town. Galicia has never been the most profitable wine region in Iberia, and Catalan, Valencian and Aragonese wine regions are easily capable of outproducing it annually. However, the vineyards of Ribero are a great source of pride for the town, and thus VNG has pledged to enact protectionist measures to ensure the future of Galician wine, so that no proud Galician patriot is forced to merely buy Catalan wine for their needs. While UCRA is hardly a massive union in any way, dwarfing in comparison to even regional branches of the anarcho-syndicalist Confederacion Rexional Galaixa, its inclusion into the ranks of VNG has made de las Casas’ claim of the party’s support for Galician workers far less flimsy than it previously was.\n\nMany within the Vangarda now hope that more local agrarian organisations and groups would join de las Casas’ movement, but given the grip that Losada’s and Álvarez’s agrarians hold on these regional groups, this might be far too optimistic of a development to hope for. Nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction, and perhaps with further victories, the proletariat and peasantry of Galicia can be lured away from the syndicalist politics of CRG and its cronies."

However, despite his collaboration with the members of that faction of the hegemonic PG, Ramón Martínez López and Xoan Xesús González, de las Casas has also maintained close contact with the traditionalist right of Galicia, especially Anton Losada Dieguez and Vicente Risco. Given that many within the left-wing of PG have jumped ship to join VNG, it is hardly an option to create an alliance with PG or its two offshoots, Organización Republicana Gallega Autónoma and Partido Nazonalista Republicán Galego, who view de las Casas as a dangerous populist, or at best, an opportunistic schemer. However, for de las Casas, these opinions matter little, for his old allies on the Galician right would take the option of a coalition with the new government of VNG without a doubt.\n\nThis may seem odd at first given de las Casas’ left-leaning ideals, but the two groups share a strong commitment to the Galician nationalism and neither is particularly happy to serve under the former hegemon PG. The flexible ideology of de las Casas is also one of the key pillars to the possible coalition’s success, especially given that the populist has worked on numerous projects of Losada and Risco in the past, be they the Nos magazine or the Irmandade Nazonalista Galego organisation. ING and Losada’s Partido Republicano Agrario would serve as the central coalition partners with VNG, though there is also the provision of adding Dereita Galeguista, the corporatists of the Galician right, as de las Casas was a member of that group in the past as well, in fact one of the founders of the organisation.\n\nHowever, the coalition may run into issues with the various new initiates to VNG, especially as they tend to be less ideologically varied and vague as de las Casas himself is. Nonetheless, the party leader insists that it is needed if VNG is to formalise itself as the new leading group of Galicia, especially given that despite its surprise victory in the elections, it is still a minor party in the grand scale of Galician politics. In his eyes, de las Casas believes that his new party and its more moderate platform will allow these traditionalist nationalists to participate in Galician politics without causing wider issues in the society with their radical views. How well the coalition will work, remains to be seen, but whatever the result, it has most certainly taken the Galician politics by a storm."

GLC.174.t:0 "An End to the Linguistic Debate"
GLC.174.d:0 "The linguistic question of Galicia is one that each of the parties posits their own reaction to, with the radical left and radical right, such as the communists of Benigno Álvarez and the nationalists of Vicente Risco taking a hardliner anti-Spanish stance, while other extremists such as Manuel Souto Vilas advocating for total Spanish dominance. Most, such as PNRG, ORGA and the agrarians, advocate for Spanish language autonomy and relatively lax application of the two languages depending on the context. However, few have as peculiar of an answer to the question as the leader of VNG, Álvaro de las Casas, and his close allies and collaborators. To de las Casas, both languages have their merits, and as the politician himself does, they should be used for different means.\n\nDe las Casas believes that the Spanish is simply more advanced in matters of statecraft, legal debates and other political or administrative duties, given that Castilian has been in use since the Middle Ages. While de las Casas might have been an independentist his entire political career, he has never had an issue with Spanish language itself, and he has written numerous articles, books and theatrical plays using the language. However, de las Casas does not wish to issue a dominance of the Spanish tongue over Galician, and instead encourages the further development of Galician in arts.\n\nIn fact, if the Spanish language is to be the primary language of politicians, traders and juridical experts, then Galician shall be the language of poets, writers, philosophers as well as the common daily use language. To de las Casas, the best use of Galician is in the creative field, where it shall develop further and rise to earn its place among the larger languages of the world, while Spanish works the role it has done thus far in Galicia. This split has been met with quite a bit of confusion, though most play it off as one of de las Casas’ odd idiosyncrasies. However, to many moderates and Spanish citizens of Galicia, it has been met with praise for its unorthodox solution to the rather divisive dilemma, and even those who find it odd are simply happy to see the language debate become a thing of the past."

GLC.175.t:0 "Solidifying the Shiftiness of VNG"
GLC.175.d:0 "The Vangarda Nazonalista party is almost as much of a paradox as its leader Álvaro de las Casas. Made up, nominally, of the left-wing of Partido Galeguista’s dissidents, intellectual and cultural allies of de las Casas and enthusiastic supporters of the Ultreya youth group, it is an odd bunch, even before one factors in the conservative allies of VNG, such as the traditionalist parties Partido Republicano Agrario and Irmandade Nazonalista Galego. De las Casas seems to fluctuate between his commitment to left-wing progressivism and nationalist conservatism, and many of his close supporters are not entirely sure what mood he leans towards during the day.\n\nThis odd mixture of ideals, which de las Casas refers to as his own aristocratic populism or socialism, has been a divisive feature of the VNG since its very beginning, and many demand that the shifty party leader finally opens his particular ideals for all to see, so that the party may move onwards with an unified platform. The most logical decision, especially after the recent influx of Partido Galeguista voters to the Vangarda, would be to continue the course officially under radically nationalist progressivism, not fully adopting socialism as an ideology but fighting for the republican ideals full throttle, within the bounds of the Galician society of course. Another option would be to integrate various Christian progressives and even socialists, especially those within the orbit of Basilio Álvarez, adopting Christian socialism as the official ideology of the party.\n\nHowever, de las Casas is personally perhaps the most interested in mixing his personal Christian faith with the conservative and populist practices and his interest in socialist politics, creating a curious mix of paternal or aristocratic socialism, making his policies more acceptable to his nationalist and conservative allies on the right. The final option would be to mix the nationalist radicalism of de las Casas and his right-wing allies in the PRA and ING, and combining it with the progressive economic ideals of de las Casas and his left-wing allies to create a perfect blend of patriotism."

GLC.176.t:0 "Ultreias, the Next Generation"
GLC.176.d:0 "One of the central objectives of Vangarda Nazonalista has always been the spreading and development of the Galician culture, stemming from the group’s numerous artists, writers and dreamers, the leader Álvaro de las Casas and one of the central young figures of the Ultreya youth movement, Xosé María Álvarez Blázquez, being such poets and writers as well. The Ultreias, or Agrupación Xuvenil Galeguista Ultreia as they are officially known, is a youth movement originally started by de las Casas and some of his associates, such as Camilo Díaz Valiño, Xosé Filgueira Valverde and Vicente Risco, which in its base form was meant to be an apolitical tool to teach patriotic love for the lands of Galicia to the nation’s youth. However, after his rise to power in Galicia, de las Casas has fully annexed the organisation into VNG, as the youth group had already been in the decline for nearly half a decade as its rivalry with the Partido Galeguista’s youth wing Federación de Mocidades Galeguistas intensified to the point that Ultreias became practically sidelined.\n\nWith their adoption as VNG’s youth front, however, their activity has revitalised and cells of the group once thought lost have been reactivated. Inspired originally by the Palestra, a youth group roughly analogous to the Scouts of Anglo world, as well as the Basque Mendigoixales, the Ultreias are aimed at boys aged twelve to eighteen, with the promotion of healthy activities such as hiking, sports and cruises along the Galician coast as its main non-political goal. However, political activities related to the spread of Galicianism are also undertaken, and Ultreias go out during weekends to sell books written in the local language to folks all over the nation. Similarly, adoration for the homeland is cultivated through collective reading of local classics as well as new publications from the Seminario de Estudos Galegos.\n\nSome groups such as the one in the town of Tui, led by professor Manuel Fernández Costas, also do practical scientific work with excavation, as the boys would leave their homes in the break of dawn, head to the local hill and dig into it in hopes of finding remnants of the ancient Castro culture of Galicia. While the integration of the Ultreias into the fabric of VNG has been met with criticism from some more apolitical members of the group, as well as those belonging to other parties, such as Xosé Filgueira and Camilo Díaz, members of Dereita Galeguista and Partido Galeguista respectively, others hope that it will help revitalise the operations of the Ultreia, providing practical education and much needed activities to the youths of the nation, paving way for a whole new generation of patriots in the future."

GLC.177.t:0 "Demolishing the Dynastic Structures of Galician Politics"
GLC.177.d:0 "The Galician democratic foundations were met with a completely unforeseen dilemma when the radical populist Álvaro de las Casas was elected as the nation’s first truly democratic president at the head of his Vangarda Nazonalista party. The election of de las Casas, man known for his immense ambition and hunger for power almost as much as for his ever-shifting allegiances, was a shock to the entire nation, and many feared that his Totalist-sympathies would guide Galicia towards dangerous and undemocratic directions. Yet this future has not come to pass, and now, Galicia enjoys a wholly revitalised democracy, no longer dominated by the former hegemon Partido Galeguista. The clique-riddled and elitist politics of the past, lorded over by the academians of PG, ORGA and PNRG, are behind us, and today, the demagogue, populist and agitator are the organs of the people’s will.\n\nPolitics belong to the grassroots, and de las Casas, always with two fingers on the pulse of the nation’s daily life, delivers on the demands of his people at the turn of a dime, shifting his positions to meet the expectations of Galicians. This has, of course, made the day-to-day politics of the nation far more unpredictable, and the dynastic parties, if one can call the old centrist groups that, are struggling to keep up with the whirlwind that is the VNG party under its Red Chieftain. The radical traditionalists of Vicente Risco have found themselves neutered by their coalition with the Vangarda, while the traditionalists of Anton Losada struggle to push their policies under the shade of de las Casas’ newfound power.\n\nThe socialists and syndicalists struggle to garner support from the proletariat, drunk with the paternalistic yet benevolent economic policies of the VNG. There is no niche VNG cannot fill, and where the Ultreias of de las Casas go, the beating drums, colourful banners and evocative slogans of their parades capture the hearts and minds of the Galician people. The Red Chieftain and his followers seem unbeatable, but in this new dynamic environment they have created, popular attitude may shift like a leaf in the wind, and thus VNG must utilise every trick up its sleeves to ensure further streaks of victories if it wishes to truly transform Galicia into the enigmatic vision of de las Casas."

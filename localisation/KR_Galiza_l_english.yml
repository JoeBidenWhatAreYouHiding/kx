### Focuses ###
GLC_focus:0 "Galician Focus Tree"

GLC_Liberty:0 "Nós, Nomeámonos!"
GLC_Liberty_desc:0 "For as long as any of us remember, the Spanish flag has hung over the lands of Euskadi, keeping Basques chained to their dying empire. When the Republic was proclaimed four years ago, we expected the more liberal Spaniards to honour our customs, but that project was a short-lived and chaotic disaster, and only brought back the harsh military rule that again stomped on our independence. The new king claimed to bring more freedoms to us, but spat in our face with the rejection of the reforms. We have taken matters into our own hands, and while the future is uncertain, Basques have finally removed the shackle of Madrid."

GLC_A_Corunan_Factories:0 "The Crown of Atlantic Coast"
GLC_A_Corunan_Factories_desc:0 "Bilbao, our largest settlement, has long been a developing city. Its factories and mills churn out products day and night, everything from weapons to ships to civilian goods. The provisional government has decided to enact emergency nationalisation of these factories to supply us with everything we need to stop a potential Spanish invasion into our lands."

GLC_Batallon_Literario:0 "Raising a New Batallón Literario"
GLC_Batallon_Literario_desc:0 "The Iron Ring of Bilbao is a set of fortifications and bunkers around the entire Basque territory that was originally meant to defend our lands from possible Communard invasion, but our government has expanded it secretly for years now in case Spain would ever fall into a situation where we could proclaim independence. While nowhere near complete, these labyrinthine constructions could shelter our soldiers and civilians alike should the enemy over the border seek to threaten our freedom."

GLC_Summon_Our_Celtic_Brothers:0 "Our Brothers at the End of the Earth"
GLC_Summon_Our_Celtic_Brothers_desc:0 "The Spanish Guardia Civil had many of its troops posted on our lands, and the border with France was manned by some of Spain’s most loyal soldiers. When Alfonso was shot, these troops scrambled for the heartlands of Spain, and only a skeleton crew was left behind to keep us in check, a garrison that we easily defeated when our revolt began. There remains many guns and other weapons in storage, left by the Spaniards, and it would be a sin to leave them to rust in the warehouses. Basque patriots will put them to good use against their former owners."

GLC_Bring_the_Diaspora_Home:0 "The Cuban Diaspora Returns Home!"
GLC_Bring_the_Diaspora_Home_desc:0 "Ertzana is the local police force of Basques hastily established from those native Guardia Asalto and Guardia Civil troops, who were present here when the instability and chaos engulfed Spain. While merely a militia by the standards of national militaries, these policemen are willing to die for our country and must serve as a first line of defence as we create a proper military force."

GLC_Disarm_Guardia_Civil:0 "Wrest Guardias Out of Spanish Control"
GLC_Disarm_Guardia_Civil_desc:0 "The government of Euskadi has seen it fit to utilize volunteer tradesmen gathered from both our main parties of EAJ and EAE but also from the trade union ELA to further extend the Iron ring of Bilbao. We cannot build quite as strong fortifications in this short timespan as the main body of the Iron Ring has, but every bunker and trench helps in this difficult situation."

GLC_Seize_Spanish_Assets:0 "Loot the Carcass of Castilian Imperialism"
GLC_Seize_Spanish_Assets_desc:0 "the gnuts." 

GLC_Haven_for_Exiled_Republicans:0 "Haven of Exiled Republicans"
GLC_Haven_for_Exiled_Republicans_desc:0 "The Absolutists and Militarists of Madrid are our enemy, not the Spanish themselves." 

GLC_Raise_The_Irmandinos:0 "The Irmandiños Ride to Ruin Once More"
GLC_Raise_The_Irmandinos_desc:0 "The Irmandinos, medieval anti-Castilian peasants, return to beat the shit out of Spanish imperialists." 

GLC_Second_Rexurdimento:0 "Second Rexurdimento Begins!"
GLC_Second_Rexurdimento_desc:0 "The Absolutists and Militarists of Madrid are our enemy, not the Spanish themselves." 

GLC_Fan_the_Flames_of_Budding_Galicianism:0 "Fan the Flames of Galicianism"
GLC_Fan_the_Flames_of_Budding_Galicianism_desc:0 "The Absolutists and Militarists of Madrid are our enemy, not the Spanish themselves." 

GLC_The_End_of_Seculos_Escuros:0 "Seculos Escuros Come to an End"
GLC_The_End_of_Seculos_Escuros_desc:0 "The Absolutists and Militarists of Madrid are our enemy, not the Spanish themselves."

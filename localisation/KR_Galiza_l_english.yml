### Focuses ###
GLC_focus:0 "Galician Focus Tree"

GLC_Liberty:0 "Nós, Nomeámonos!" 
GLC_Liberty_desc:0 "The fledgling Galician nationalism, long obscured in the shadow of its more prominent cousins in Catalonia and Basque Country, has finally had its unexpected fulfillment. With the support of Basque and Catalan militias, the Galician patriots have seized control of the wayward region, forcing the Ferrol garrison to surrender. Already, exiled Galician nationalists from the New World are making their way to our shores to join the fray, and for the first time ever since the independent Galician realms, this Atlantic province of Spain is free. The war against Spain looms in the horizon, but loyal sons of Galicia are prepared to defend their newfound libery to the end."

GLC_A_Corunan_Factories:0 "The Crown of Atlantic Coast"
GLC_A_Corunan_Factories_desc:0 "A Coruña, the crown of Atlantic, is hardly the industrial giant of Iberia, but even this backwards region has some semblance of industry. While limited in scope to consumer goods, civilian hardware and textiles, it is nonetheless capable of supplying some equipment and necessary goods for our rebellion against the Spanish regime. Similarly, whatever material can be scrounged up from the Ferrol garrison and dockyards for military use will be immediately shipped to the militia units of our provisional army, so that they do not need to go into battle armed with shovels and pitchforks."

GLC_Batallon_Literario:0 "Raising a New Batallón Literario"
GLC_Batallon_Literario_desc:0 "Batallón Literario is a military unit type native to Galicia, that has existed in one form or another since the mid-1600s, though the most notable iteration of this venerable martial tradition was the one formed in 1808 to fight against the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte. It is usually made up of students and faculty members of the university of Galicia, and the new Batallón Literario will take a similar shape of volunteers. While these men will hardly be more experienced or trained than those of their militia counterparts, it is hoped that their nationalism for Galicia propels them into battle with great fervour, and that through their education, they may be able to become the officers and commanders of the future Galician national army."

GLC_Summon_Our_Celtic_Brothers:0 "Our Brothers at the End of the Earth"
GLC_Summon_Our_Celtic_Brothers_desc:0 "Galicia is one of the most debated regions of Iberia in its origins, as Galicians are often considered to be Celtic in origin, and while the language they speak is not Celtic indeed, we do share the heritage rather proudly alongside our Portuguese brothers. As such, the Lusitanian regime, while not particularly interested in the republicanism and love of democracy that the Galicians espouse, is nonetheless likely to assist us out of sheer support for their formerly Celtic brethren and the bond that our small province shares with the Portuguese as the most Atlantic lands of Iberia."

GLC_Bring_the_Diaspora_Home:0 "The Cuban Diaspora Returns Home!"
GLC_Bring_the_Diaspora_Home_desc:0 "When the Second Republic was squashed, many Galicians fled Spain out fear for military repressions, especially those who had been active in Galicianist sectors. However, now that the rebellion is in full swing and the Spanish control over the peninsula is fading, Galicians from all over the globe are returning to their homeland en masse, eager to take up arms for the liberation of their beloved province. Most are coming from the island of Cuba, where large quantities of Galicians fled to even during the Primo de Rivera era, and where they formed communities of Galicians yearning for a liberated homeland. With their help, the ranks of Galician militias are swelling to untold heights."

GLC_Disarm_Guardia_Civil:0 "Wrest Guardias Out of Spanish Control"
GLC_Disarm_Guardia_Civil_desc:0 "Many Guardia Civil officers here in Galicia support the Madrid regime, but there are also a lot of those who yearn back to the freedom that was promised during the republican years. Many who do not consider themselves Galicians, may still be wooed with the promise of better civil rights, freer economic potential and the restoration of the ideals of the Spanish Republic, and thus we must do our best to attract these ideological drifters among the police force into our ranks."

GLC_Seize_Spanish_Assets:0 "Loot the Carcass of Castilian Imperialism"
GLC_Seize_Spanish_Assets_desc:0 "Many businesses of Spanish nationalists are located here in Galicia, ripe for the taking for the new regime’s war effort. From companies owned by loathsome lapdogs of Madrid to the lands of wealthy land owners, all will be seized from these traitors to the province they claim to love yet refuse to support in independence. We cannot allow such vipers a moment to breathe, or they will strike their venomous fangs into the freed skin of Galicia and poison its soil with their hateful existence." 

GLC_Haven_for_Exiled_Republicans:0 "Haven of Exiled Republicans"
GLC_Haven_for_Exiled_Republicans_desc:0 "The Spanish Republicans may have been driven from their lands to the New World or democratic bastions of Europe, but they are welcome in the newly independent republic of Galicia. Like the Spanish republicans, we dream of a peninsula free from tyrants and despots, be they military leaders of crowned noblemen. Though some republican Spaniards may find it distasteful to support a separatist regime, others see it as the only chance for an Iberian state that embodies the values of the perished Second Republic, and are willing to fight for a cause that is not their own if it gives them a chance to strike at the Madrid regime." 

GLC_Raise_The_Irmandinos:0 "The Irmandiños Ride to Ruin Once More"
GLC_Raise_The_Irmandinos_desc:0 "The Irmandinos, medieval anti-Castilian peasants, are the closest Galicia has had to an independence militancy during its long existence, and thus, if our army is to draw inspiration from somewhere, it is from these brave warriors of Galicia. As such, the name of Galician militias today draw their origin from them, and while our current warriors may hold slightly more sophisticated weapons and use more modern tactics, their bravery and loyalty to Galicia is only second to the brave Irmandinos of yore." 

GLC_Second_Rexurdimento:0 "Second Rexurdimento Begins!"
GLC_Second_Rexurdimento_desc:0 "The Galician Rexurdimento, or Renaissance, is perhaps the sole reason Galicianism and Galician nationalism exists at all. Spearheaded by titans of the local literature scene such as the mother of Galicianism Rosalía de Castro, the ever-productive Manuel Curros Enríquez and the academic pioneer Valentín Lamas Carvajal, this renaissance would see Galicianism become a veritable form of Iberian identity politics, and its repercussions are felt today in the independent Galician nation today. With figures such as Castelao, Pedrayo and Risco behind our new state, the second Rexurdimento is right around the corner for Galicia!" 

GLC_Fan_the_Flames_of_Budding_Galicianism:0 "Fan the Flames of Galicianism"
GLC_Fan_the_Flames_of_Budding_Galicianism_desc:0 "The Galicianists have long supported the independence project, but it has remained a somewhat small movement of Galician-speaking intelligentsia. However, with our independence well underway, it is time to spread the love of Galicia to the peasants, workers and regular people of Galicia as well, so that all can share the love of Galician culture and art." 

GLC_The_End_of_Seculos_Escuros:0 "Seculos Escuros Come to an End"
GLC_The_End_of_Seculos_Escuros_desc:0 "The battles are over, the guns fall silent and as the dust settles, Galicia stands strong, proud and most importantly, free. We have proven our enemies wrong and sceptics must now swallow their bitter words about the true power of Galician nationalism, for despite its humble beginnings, it now leads an entire nation in this corner of Iberia. Our trials have only just begun, but perhaps the greatest peak on our way have now been scaled." 


GLC_VNG_victory:0 "Populist Patriots of VNG Take Lead!"
GLC_VNG_victory_desc:0 "For as long as any of us remember, the Spanish flag has hung over the lands of Euskadi, keeping Basques chained to their dying empire. When the Republic was proclaimed four years ago, we expected the more liberal Spaniards to honour our customs, but that project was a short-lived and chaotic disaster, and only brought back the harsh military rule that again stomped on our independence. The new king claimed to bring more freedoms to us, but spat in our face with the rejection of the reforms. We have taken matters into our own hands, and while the future is uncertain, Basques have finally removed the shackle of Madrid."

GLC_Red_Chieftain:0 "Red Chieftain"
GLC_Red_Chieftain_desc:0 "Bilbao, our largest settlement, has long been a developing city. Its factories and mills churn out products day and night, everything from weapons to ships to civilian goods. The provisional government has decided to enact emergency nationalisation of these factories to supply us with everything we need to stop a potential Spanish invasion into our lands."

GLC_Reel_in_PG_Left_Flank:0 "Pulling in PG's Progressives"
GLC_Reel_in_PG_Left_Flank_desc:0 "The Iron Ring of Bilbao is a set of fortifications and bunkers around the entire Basque territory that was originally meant to defend our lands from possible Communard invasion, but our government has expanded it secretly for years now in case Spain would ever fall into a situation where we could proclaim independence. While nowhere near complete, these labyrinthine constructions could shelter our soldiers and civilians alike should the enemy over the border seek to threaten our freedom."

GLC_Clearing_Up_Confusion:0 "Our Shifty Leanings Solidified"
GLC_Clearing_Up_Confusion_desc:0 "The Spanish Guardia Civil had many of its troops posted on our lands, and the border with France was manned by some of Spain’s most loyal soldiers. When Alfonso was shot, these troops scrambled for the heartlands of Spain, and only a skeleton crew was left behind to keep us in check, a garrison that we easily defeated when our revolt began. There remains many guns and other weapons in storage, left by the Spaniards, and it would be a sin to leave them to rust in the warehouses. Basque patriots will put them to good use against their former owners."

GLC_Totalism_in_Aesthetics_Only:0 "Totalism in Aesthetics Only"
GLC_Totalism_in_Aesthetics_Only_desc:0 "Ertzana is the local police force of Basques hastily established from those native Guardia Asalto and Guardia Civil troops, who were present here when the instability and chaos engulfed Spain. While merely a militia by the standards of national militaries, these policemen are willing to die for our country and must serve as a first line of defence as we create a proper military force."

GLC_Galician_Right_to_Wine:0 "Defenders of Dionysos' Gift"
GLC_Galician_Right_to_Wine_desc:0 "The government of Euskadi has seen it fit to utilize volunteer tradesmen gathered from both our main parties of EAJ and EAE but also from the trade union ELA to further extend the Iron ring of Bilbao. We cannot build quite as strong fortifications in this short timespan as the main body of the Iron Ring has, but every bunker and trench helps in this difficult situation."

GLC.2.t:0 "Status of Labour Parties in Elections"
GLC.2.d:0 "With Galician independence secured, the provisional government led by Partido Galeguista has announced elections, but with much of the government dominated by conservative figures such as Vicente Risco, Ramon Otero Pedrayo and Xosé Filgueira Valverde, some have questioned whether the socialists of Unión Socialista Galega and the anarchists led by Ricardo Mella would be allowed to take part in the elections. Partido Galeguista itself is in an internal crisis on the matter with the liberals and social democrats within the party calling for the allowing of socialist parties while the conservatives see it as a dangerous and risky move. The Castelao government is struggling to find an answer to the situation, given that the socialists and anarchists supported the rebellion against Spain but also pose a threat to the continued existence of liberal democracy in the new Galician republic. While USG and the anarchists alone most likely do not have the popularity and party outreach to gather the hearts and minds of Galicians to pull a victory, many conservatives especially in Partido Republicano Agrario and Dereita Galeguista have called for immediate protests should the socialist entry into elections be allowed. The precarious political situation in Galicia demands immediate response, and the provisional government must reach an agreement or the situation may cause a worsening crisis."
GLC.2.a:0 "Allow socialist entry into elections."
GLC.2.b:0 "Shelter our liberty from these revolutionary elements."

GLC.3.t:0 "Week of Woes"
GLC.3.d:0 "With our decision to ban the socialists and syndicalists from participating in elections, the local branch of CNT-FAI and its allies in USG have proclaimed nation-wide strikes. While they have been unable to truly halt the Galician economy due to rather large number of non-union workers and the reluctance of non-socialist unions to join their actions, these strikes have nonetheless disrupted the dockyards, fledgling industrial sector and canneries of Galicia, causing some economic setbacks and even brief fisticuffs between anarchists and the paramilitary forces of Vicente Risco and Antonio Losadas, the Irmandades Nazonalista Galego. However, left-leaning members of the Galician political scene, especially the leader of Vangarda Nazionalista Galego, Álvaro de las Casas Blanco, have been vocal in their support for these strikes, calling the ban unconstitutional. Some claim that de las Casas is only using this to attract worker votes for his minor party, and the man does have a rather long and storied past as a populist, but he is not alone. Basílio Álvares, the leader of Galician agrarian movement, has been supportive of the strikers, no doubt because of his interest in agrarian socialism, and while rest of the Galician left-wing scene has been ambivalent or supportive of the line of Partido Galeguista, these two dissident voices have considerably weakened the government position. As such, some of the more hawkish anti-syndicalists in the government have begun to call for a police crackdown on the strikes, seeing the possibility of a revolution as only a matter of time. However, the more moderate members of the provisional government do not see this as a possibility, and in their view, the government can either attempt to negotiate with the strikers to achieve a middle ground, or simply reverse the ban as a sign of goodwill."
GLC.3.a:0 "The ban was a bad idea, we must give in."
GLC.3.b:0 "Perhaps we can negotiate a deal to end the riots without reversing the ban."
GLC.3.c:0 "This is a clear sign of syndicalist agitation for a revolution, crush them!"

GLC.4.t:0 "Crimson Banners Rise Over Galicia"
GLC.4.d:0 "As the Galician police forces were deployed to quell the on-going dockyard and industrial strikes, it soon became apparent that the anarchists under Ricardo Mella and the socialists of USG had come prepared. Police attempts to break the picket lines and drive the workers out from their blockades were met with aggressive counter-attacks, with police batons met with volleys of bricks and stones. Police officers soon found themselves overwhelmed by the strike guards, who had armed themselves with industrial tools, fishing harpoons and even with the few firearms that they had access to, and while the police deployed few of their exceedingly rare Bilbao armoured cars to the scene, they found themselves driven back by improvised firebombs. The worker militias captured revolvers, pistols and Destructor carbines from wounded or surrendering officers, and as the paramilitary groups converged upon the government buildings in areas like Ferrol, A Coruña, Vigo and Lugo, they were met mostly by demoralised and wholly outnumbered groups of former Guardia Civil officers and local policemen. Neither side was particularly interested in shedding blood, but it seemed more and more likely by the moment. The provisional government, watching the situation unfold, was paralysed by indecision, with the workers demanding their immediate surrender or a violent revolution would overthrow the regime either way. The police force was ready to open fire and put an end to the revolution, but this would inevitably lead to horrible casualties on both sides, forever staining the reputation of the provisional government, while a surrender would lead to a socialist takeover. The choice lay heavy on the heads of the provisional government, and as the emotionless barrels of two opposing sides stared at one another, the time for difficult decisions had arrived."

GLC.5:0 "Enter Risco"
GLC.5.d:0 "The order was given, and the police forces of the Galician republic lay down their arms, surrendering the nation to the workers. However, as the leadership of the rebellion, led by the venerable anarcho-collectivist Ricardo Mella, as well as his close ally Xohán Xesús González and daughter Urania Mella, were making their way to officially announce their victory, the worker militias in A Coruña were met by a new foe. The nationalist paramilitary group Irmandades Nazionalista Galego, trained in secret to face the Spaniards before the Galician independence war, had arrived, led by the eccentric far-right nationalist Vicente Risco and his right-hand man Antonio Losada, and they demanded an immediate disbanding of the revolutionary militias or a full-scale attack by the ING would begin. The proletarian masses, drunk with the newfound power, responded with immediate hostility at the demands of these reactionary nationalists, and a clash occurred between the two forces. The police forces, at least those who had not yet been disarmed, joined the side of the ING, and carnage followed as clashes between the two sides turned into firefights. However, given the lack of firepower and amateurish nature of the two militias, not even the leaders of either movement could tell which side was truly winning, and in the confusing melee, shots and blows were exchanged until one side broke into a rout, sealing the fate of Galicia to the winner’s hands. As the dust settled, the last side standing was revealed to be..."

glc.20.d:0 "With Galicia finally free of Castilian oppressive rule, we can organize the first republic properly and hold our first elections. Six parties have announced that they will run in the upcoming elections, representing both wholly Galician parties and former members of larger Spain-wide parties.\n\nRepresenting left-wing democrats is the Vangarda Nazonalista Galega, led by Álvaro de las Casas, advocating for a moderate socialist and heavily nationalist reformation of Galician society. Centrist big-tent parties, Partido Republicano Gallego of Anton Villar Ponte and Partido Galeguista of Alfonso Castelao, represent liberal currents within Basque society, with PRG advocating for a federalized Galician state and heavy contacts with the other new Iberian minority states of Catalonia and Euskadi. Partido Galeguista in turn is seeking to Europeanize Galicia and develop it both culturally and economically in the direction of truly modern state.\n\nRepresenting Galician right in turn are three parties, Irmandades da Fala led by Valentín Paz Andrade, made up of liberal conservatives and traditionalists. They support traditional Galician values and especially the cultural development of the new nation, and some rumours are also circulating about a potential installation of Galician monarchy should IdF triumph in the elections. They are opposed by the conservative movement of Ourense, Partido Nazonalista Republicán de Galicia, a highly republican Galician party seeking to strengthen the new state’s cultural identity, religious institutions and maintain public order and traditions in the region.\n\nThe final party to run in the elections is the Dereita Galeguista, a highly nationalist, political Catholic breakaway of Partido Galeguista, who left over religious issues and alliances with left-wing parties in PG.

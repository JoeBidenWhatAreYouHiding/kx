### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "Serving as a hero and leading figure within the bloody Mexican Revolution, Emiliano Zapata is one of the most respected, as well as one of the most divisive, figures in the nation. Born in Morelos in 1879, Emiliano Zapata Salazar was born into a well-off and popular family of mestizo famers. This rural upbringing greatly influenced his later views, but despite popular claims that he began life as an impoverished child of native blood, Zapata’s upbringing was decently comfortable. Regardless, after receiving basic education and with the death of his father while Zapata was just 16, the future hero of Mexico was forced to shoulder the burden of caring for his family, starting off on a series of odd jobs and entrepreneurial ventures. \nWith the rise of the Porfirio Díaz regime, Zapata and his local town of Anenecuilco - long a hotbed of anti-elitist thought - began to once more vigorously protest the expanding hacienda system, and after meeting with Díaz to a discuss possible deal, Zapata and his allies were arrested and conscripted into the Federal Army - a sentence that would come to benefit him given the great martial experience it granted him. After returning home, Zapata was elected as the new chief elder of his hometown with the retirement of Josė Merino, and would continue to rally his allies against the hacienda system and against the Díaz regime until the Mexican Revolution finally broke out a few years later. Allying with Pancho Villa and later Álvaro Obregón, Zapata proved to be a masterful guerilla tactician, and with his help, the Socialists came out victorious in the war. \nFollowing the Mexican Revolution and after three back-to-back PLM presidents, Zapata broke their political monopoly and achieved victory in Mexico's 1932 Presidential election with his PNA. Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through economic incentives and with Mexican oil on offer, has fostered close diplomatic ties with the Third Internationale. However, his vaguely Socialist stances and deeply Socialist allies have angered many, causing radical anti-Socialists and antagonized democratic elements to assemble and take action across the nation. With instability and civil strife rearing their ugly heads once more, Zapata and his regime must take care, for a coming storm is brewing over Mexico once more."
POLITICS_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "General Plutarco Elías Calles was born on 25 September 1877 to an alcoholic bureaucrat father. Calles took his surname from his aunt's husband, who's family raised him following the death of his mother; it was from his secular school-teacher uncle where Calles learned his distain for religion and the church, influencing his politics in his later life. His adolescence was not easy, the stigma around him being an orphan and his family's low social status drove Calles to be a hard worker, moving around many jobs throughout his youth. Upon the arrival of the Mexican Revolution, Calles would join Madero and serve as a police commissioner under him, allowing him to rise through the ranks to the position of Governor of Sonora. Upon the rising of the Constitutionalist Army, Calles sided with Carranza, but as Carranza's power base fell, Calles joined with fellow Sonoran general Alvaro Obregon in rising against him, eventually cementing a position in Obregon's cabinet as a minister of Finance. An ardent supporter of Trade Unions and Social Democracy, Calles was given a prime position in the administration of Zapata when he was elected President. Calles often urged Zapata to take a hard line against the church, however these requests have often fell on deaf ears from the President; with the growing rift between the two figures on the church issue leading some to speculate that the tragic assassination of Zapata was done on Calles' orders. Regardless of whether Calles is responsible for Zapata's death, he now has complete control of the Mexican government, and has successfully pinned the death of Zapata on a group of reactionary generals. The totalitarian and rabidly anti-clerical tone of Calles's rhetoric have gone beyond any of Mexico's mainstream socialist politicians, and his rejection of agrarianism and support for full integration of indigenous Mexicans could represent a radical new direction for Mexico if implemented."
POLITICS_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "Born as José Doroteo Arango Arámbula in Durango in 1878, few know him as anything else besides Francisco ‘Pancho’ Villa now. Revolutionary hero, agrarian, folk figure, and near-saint in the eyes of many of Mexico’s northern poor, Pancho Villa is as Mexican as they come. Though his early life is shrouded by self-cast mystery, it is known that he received little schooling at a local church as a boy before becoming a farmer and agricultural worker in a variety of disciplines, later even becoming the foreman of a U.S rail company laying new track near the border. Moving around for this work, he returned to Durango when only 16 in order to murder the man accused of raping Pancho’s sister, stealing a horse after the murder and putting him on the wanted list of the Rurales of the Porfriato. Due to his connections with powerful figure Pablo Valenzuela, Villa was spared execution and instead was forcibly enrolled in the Federal Army. Months later, he would desert and flee to Chihuahua, eventually changing his name while on the run to Francisco ‘Pancho’ Villa, though whether he took the name from his grandfather or another bandit is disputed. Living life on the run as a bandit for years, Villa would eventually find purpose after meeting Abraham González de Hermosillo y Casavantes, and through him, Madero himself. These detractors of the Díaz regime would turn the young Villa on the path to becoming a true patriot, dropping his selfish bandit lifestyle to rise as a freedom fighter and revolutionary for the people of Mexico. Barely 30 when the Revolution finally broke out, Villa rode the wave of shifting sides and civil conflict, fighting against Huerta, Obregon, and Carranza, joining the side of his long-term friend and political ally Emiliano Zapata, and eventually rising to stand atop the victor’s pile when the fighting finally ended. Still serving in the army and keeping his charismatic outlaw-like personality and reputation, Pancho Villa helped guide the Mexican Revolution with his Agrarian ideas and calls for land reform until finally winding up as President himself. Long detesting power and politics, even hating his brief time as governor of Chihuahua after the Revolution ended, Pancho Villa is known by his endless legion of supporters as the Mexican Robin Hood or ‘La Cucaracha’, and under this hesitant yet charismatic hero, Mexico and her people will finally know true freedom and prosperity, supported by egalitarian land reform and the ejidos system, without having to fear the rise of authoritarianism and overbearing governance ever again."
POLITICS_PABLO_GONZALEZ_GARZA_DESC:0 "Born on May 5th, 1879 in Lampazos de Naranjo, our General Pablo Gonzalez Garza came from humble beginnings, with his parents being mere shopkeepers. Garza became an orphan at 6 years old, yet still managed to receive a scholarship from a prestigious military academy.\n\n In 1911 Garza joined with Francisco I. Madero against Díaz, and subsequently joined the rebellion against Pascual Orozco, then joining against Victoriano Huerta.\n\n Despite gaining the title of "the general who never won a victory", Garza became a rising military star within Mexico. As Carranza's front collapsed Garza assassinated his late ally and leader of the constitutionalist front defecting to Obregón; Mexico's legitimate President, and marking the end of the Mexican Revolution.\n\n Throughout the years that followed Garza made his opposition to the growing Agrarian Socialist front of Zapata and Villa known; with many suspecting that Garza was responsible for the death of President Zapata. General Garza waited for the opportune moment to cleanse his beloved Mexico of socialist corruption; with the success of a military coup in Mexico, he is poised to do just that."
POLITICS_JOSE_URQUIZA_DESC:0 "Jose Antonia Urquiza, fervent catholic and anti-socialist, has outmaneuvred his ostensible allies within the Mexican military to assume control of the presidency. President Urquiza is as certain to promote faith in his Sinarquist regime as faith in God Himself."
POLITICS_VINCENTE_TOLEDANO_DESC:0 "Titan of the Mexican revolutionary Left, the Mexican trade union movement would probably not be as developed without Vicente Lombardo Toledano.\n\nGovernor of Puebla for more than a year, secretary and close confidant of former president and revolutionary hero Emilio Zapata, a distinguished professor of literature, a recognized and respected union organizer, and now the head of the Mexican nation, no one can deny Toledano's vast experience in a variety of fields, all of which have one thing in common: the improvement of the living conditions of the common people.\n\nToledano leads the Partido Popular Socialista, modelling most of its policies on European Syndicalism, while maintaining some purely Mexican characteristics. Their main policies included the federalization of Mexico and the creation of a true direct workers' democracy through the unions, large infrastructure construction programs and mass urbanization, all while still protecting the peasants and supporting the ‘Ejidos’ created by Zapata.\n\nAlthough Toledano presented himself as a charismatic but rather classical syndicalist, those closest to him could not help but notice his authoritarian tendencies and his affection for Leninist theory. Some say that Toledano imagine himself as the "Lenin of the West", the only guardian of Marxist orthodoxy, surrounded on all sides by bourgeois and revisionists, a man who would not be afraid to make the sacrifices necessary to transform Mexico into a true socialist industrial paradise, and finally, one day, achieve Communism. The future will soon reveal if these rumors about this singular syndicalist are true..."
POLITICS_DONA_ITURBIDE_DESC:0 "A descendant of the failed Austrian campaign in Mexico more than a hundred years ago, Doña María Josepha Sophia de Habsburgo-Itúrbide has been crowned Empress of the new Mexican Monarchy. She traces descent from both Mexico's final indigenous Emperor, Agustín de Iturbide, and the adopted son of Maximillian. As an Austrian, her ascension to the throne has fostered closer ties between Austria and Mexico. Though she may be a devout Catholic, Doña María has openly stated her opposition to a Church-lead state. Instead, she uses her influence to persuade officials into pursuing more secular policies of governance, including the freedom of religion. Despite small dealings and suggestions to her cabinet now and again, the Empress is apolitical, choosing to let her ministers deal with the minutiae of governance and instead making diplomatic visits to regional powers in Central America, as well as ones to Europe and beyond. Whether or not the new Empress can right the wrongs of her ancestors or fall in a similar fate remains yet to be seen."
POLITICS_DON_LUIS:0 "Don Luis Moctezmua-Marcilla de Teruel y Gómez de Arteche has been crowned Emperor of the Fourth Mexican Empire. His legitimacy is based upon descent from the Ninth Aztec Tlatoani, Moctezuma II, linking the original Aztec empire with the two Empires that succeeded it. Thus, he lacks the dynastic links that could entangle Mexico's fate with that of another. Yet, the new King still looks backward; while he is a devout Catholic and noted Carlist sympathizer, he refuses to forget his Aztec heritage and his birthright which is the Aztec Empire of old. He has centuries of injustice to rectify and an empty seat on the stage of Latin America to fill. By taking the reins of Mexico, he is one step closer to fulfilling his ambition, and with God’s guidance, he will resurrect what was once his ancestor’s Empire, in a new, syncretic form."
POLITICS_PASCUAL_RUBIO_DESC:0 "Reform and revolution are often not good friends in the socialist vocabulary, but for Pascual Rubio, the two complement and are mutually necessary to each other, and he is living proof of that.\n\nThe son of landowners and lawyers, young Rubio was able to enter the Michoacan University of Saint Nicholas of Hidalgo, where he developed his political ideas. As a mere student, Pascual was already a fierce opponent of the dictatorial regime of Diaz and participated in clandestine demonstrations, quickly becoming a revolutionary. He joined Zapata and the revolutionaries in their just struggle during the Revolution. His calm attitude and conciliatory nature allowed him to rise to the top of the PLB, the Partido Laborista Mexicano, promoting a doctrine of democratic socialism that would serve both peasants and workers, promising bread, greater democracy, land reform, more funds for the education of the poor and the improvement of native rights.\n\nFrom a simple student to the leader of Mexico, Rubio has come a long way, but throughout his life he has always kept his love for his people and his country and is now in a position to change things for the better." 
POLITICS_JUAN_ALMAZAN_DESC:0 "When one hear the word 'revolutionary' they often think of socialists, yet Almazan is a proud revolutionary and an equally proud anti-socialist.\n\nThe son of a Catalan landowner, Juan Andreu Almazan cultivated a love for the land and his country from a young age, when as a student he worked tirelessly for Madero's presidential campaign, hoping to end the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz, which was leading Mexico to its demise. The overthrow was ultimately successful, but after many twists and turns and the execution of Madero, it seemed clear that Zapata was nothing more than a bloody socialist who would sell his country to France and England. Almazan rallied to Felix Diaz, son of the deposed dictator. After the socialists consolidated their power for good, Almazan and his PRUN party joined the Liga Democrata to oppose the tyrant.\n\nAfter the fall of the dictatorship that claimed to be a democracy, the Mexican people finally made their voices heard and voted for Juan Andreu Almazan. Now in power, Almazan intends to apply his program smoothly, the creation of a true democracy where no form of socialism will remain and the establishment of a corporatist economy. With the support of the army and the masses thanks to his populist rhetoric, Almazan intends to guide Mexico towards its rightful place in the world, alongside the other great powers" 
POLITICS_MIGUEL_VALDES_DESC:0 "The new president of Mexico is not really the kind of man one imagines when thinking of a Mexican head of state, he is indeed young and is not one of the many 'revolutionary generals' of the Mexican Revolution who dominate the political scene.\n\nMiguel Alemán Valdés is, however, one of the main figures of the Liga Democrata as one of the main leaders of the Partido Liberal Constitucionalista, leading a liberal and centrist faction promoting great plans of economic liberalization and industrialization of Mexico as well as an emphasis on the preservation of fundamental freedoms, while claiming the legacy of the hero Francisco Madero.\n\nValdés succeeded in gaining the presidency thanks to the support of the middle classes and businesses, both large and small. His presidency looks bright, despite the fact that the opposition has criticized his lack of experience and his alleged corruption and nepotism, which are barely concealed, as his cabinet is composed largely of many university friends close to the president. Nevertheless, Valdés remains determined to make Mexico one of the most modern and prosperous countries in the world." 
POLITICS_ADOLFO_HUERTA_DESC:0 "After a long and storied political career, Felipe Adolfo de la Huerta Marcor has finally risen to the highest position in the land; the position of Mexican President. Born in a prominent family, Huerta originally studied music, before getting involved in local politics; eventually joining the Constitutionalist Movement. Becoming Carranza's chief clerk and eventually provisional governor of Sonora. As Carranza's power base slipped and Obregón took the reigns of Mexico, Huerta served diligently within the President's cabinet, however was never considered as a possible successor to Obregón. Huerta was instrumental in the founding of the Partido Liberal Constitucionalista, a party founded from the ashes of several old order Liberal parties. The victory of Zapata and the foundation of the Liga Democratica drove the PCP underground, however the fall of the Socialist Regime and the restoration of Democracy launched the PCP back into the center-stage of Mexican politics. With Huerta and the PCP now firmly in power, Huerta will bring free market capitalism and middle of the road Liberalism to a Mexico long ravaged by Socialists and Reactionaries."
POLITICS_MORIN_DESC:0 "Manuel Gómez Morín, founder and Presidential candidate for the Partido Acción Nacional, has risen to Mexico's highest office following free and fair Democratic Elections. Born on February 27th 1897 in Mexico's, Morín's father died when he was young, leaving his widowed mother to move to Chihuahua, and eventually Guanajuato; the city where he finished his studies. His academic career continued when he was accepted into the Law Program at the National University of Mexico, where he befriended figures such as Miguel Palacios-Macedo, Daniel Cosío Villegas and Vicente Lombardo Toledano. In 1918 he became a Lawyer, working in several prestigious law offices and going on to help rebuild Mexico's financial system following the revolution. After the victory of Zapata in Mexico's Presidential Election, Morín, along with several others founded the PAN, however the party received little support at first. That begun to change as Mexico democratized, allowing the PAN's support base to expand. Now in power, Morín's policy will be the policy of 'National Accion', a policy of refusing to commit to either the left or the right, rather adapting their political lean depending on what's best for the Mexican Nation"
POLITICS_MANUEL_CAMACHO_DESC:0 "'The Gentleman President', Manuel Ávila Camacho, was born in a large middle-class family in the town of Puebla in 1891. A prominent revolutionary General, Manuel, along with several of his brothers joined the Army when the Mexican Revolution arrived, with Manuel quickly rising to the position of colonel by 1920. After his service in the military, Camacho joined the political scene; collaborating with moderates within the PLM and leading an liberal faction of the Liga Democratica in private. Following the Counter-Revolution, Camacho gained the nomination of the Partido Constitucional Progresista and became their candidate for president, securing a smashing victory in Mexico's first truly Democratic Election. A steadfastly moderate, diplomatic and well-mannered president, Camacho has advanced a policy of reconciliation with the Church, expanded civil liberties and social services. Camacho's policy has also been one of industrialization, as he aims to transform Mexico from an undeveloped backwater to a true industrial powerhouse. Under his watch, Mexico will remain a nation of moderate politics, with any party or group that opposes democracy and our constitution being rightfully banished from Mexico's political scene"
POLITICS_LAZARO_CARDENAS_DESC:0 "Lázaro Cárdenas del Río of the moderate Partido Laborista Mexicano has achieved victory in Mexico's presidential election. A revolutionary general, governor and once a staunch ally of the devil Calles, the counter-revolution and subsequent restoration of Mexican Democracy has led Cárdenas to backstab Calles' ideals, campaigning on a platform of reconciliation with Zapatistas and the Catholic Church alike. Cárdenas has also promoted indigenous, art and tourism in Mexico, while fighting against the oil companies that have robbed the Mexican people for so long. Famously cutting his own salary in half, shutting down casinos and brothels, and riding through the country on horseback instead of armored car, Cárdenas exemplifies the Mexican spirit of bravery and fearlessness. With Cárdenas in power Mexico will straddle the middle line between the socialist regime of old, and the democratic regime of today."
POLITICS_LAZARO_CARDENAS_TOT_DESC:0 "Lázaro Cárdenas del Río has succeeded President Plutarco Elías Calles after his tragic death . A revolutionary general, governor and ally of the late president Calles, Cárdenas now seeks to tear down everything his predecessor has built, and finally bring Democracy back to Mexico. Cárdenas has also promoted indigenous, art and tourism in Mexico, while fighting against the oil companies that have robbed the Mexican people for so long. Famously cutting his own salary in half, shutting down casinos and brothels, and riding through the country on horseback instead of armored car, Cárdenas exemplifies the Mexican spirit of bravery and fearlessness. With Cárdenas in power Mexico will know freedom and democracy once more."
POLITICS_FIDEL_VELAZQUEZ_DESC:0 "For Fidel Velázquez Sánchez the Revolution did not end in 1920, the overthrow of the dictator and the return to stability was not enough, it was necessary to look across the Atlantic and take example from our French and British comrades and their syndicalist model.\n\nAs one of the founder and main leader of the Confederación de Trabajadores de México, it is not surprising that Fidel is considered one of the guardians of syndicalist orthodoxy in Mexico, having observed the miracles of the syndicalist system during his numerous trips to France and Great Britain, where he even met great figures of the trade unionist movement such as Sébastien Faure or Arthur Horner. He was then determined to one day make his country adopt this perfect socialist model, preaching industrialization, the need for a reorganization of the state on a federal model, the need for unionization and the preservation of workers' rights above all.\n\nNow in power, thanks in large part to the support of the workers of the great urban centers, Fidel finally has the opportunity to transform Mexico according to his dreams and to make Karl Marx proud of this new workers' paradise."
POLITICS_EMILIO_GIL_DESC:0 "If loyalty had a name, it would be Emilio Portes Gil.\n\nBorn to a family of Dominican descent in Ciudad Victoria, life was not always easy for Emilio. While studying in law school he was drawn, like many other young men, into the flames of the Mexican Revolution, where he played a minor role at first. However, it was in 1915 that everything changed, when Gil met for the first time Plutarco Elias Calles, the man who would later be called El Jefe Maximo, who took him under his wing. From that moment on, Gil remained faithful to his mentor, assisting him with the best of his abilities and ensuring the correct application of the Jefe's policies, which he always found to be just and full of wisdom, he became one of Calles' close friends and confidants, always completing the tasks that his mentor entrusted to him. The good Jefe did not fail to thank him for his loyalty by entrusting him with the leadership of the Party and the Senate, which made his good friend one of the most powerful men in Mexico, some calling him the eminence grise of the regime.\n\nIf many were shocked by the death of El Jefe, perhaps Emilio was the only one who was truly saddened by the death of his friend. However, Calles' death did not mean the death of the regime! And soon, using his many connections, Emilio Portes Gil managed to emerge from the shadows and rise to the presidency, determined to faithfully continue the work of El Jefe no matter what it’ll took."
POLITICS_EUFEMIO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "For most politicians, the moment they come to power is one of joy and hope, but for Eufemio Zapata it is rather a tragedy.\n\nBorn in 1873, six years before his younger brother Emiliano Zapata, Eufemio was able to experience the suffering and poverty endured by the peasantry and the rural world during the Diaz regime, and it was only natural that he participated with his brother in the Revolution, becoming his faithful henchman. Appointed head of the revolutionary government after Emilio's ascension to the presidency, Eufemio had no interest in politics and left all decision making to the government. He prefers a hedonistic life for which he became very famous, having a reputation as a macho man with large popularity among Mexican women with whom he do not hesitate to have numerous affairs, he is also very fond of the bottle.\n\nHis lifestyle could have gone on indefinitely, but the brutal murder of his brother quickly turned him upside down, as Eufemio was elevated to a Presidency he never wanted. Now interim President, Eufemio leaves the vast majority of decision making in the hands of the cabinet, except in one specific area: the fate of his brother's killer, whom he intends to make pay for his crime."
POLITICS_VASCONCELOS_DESC:0 "The great Cultural Caudillo of the Mexican Revolution and one the most influential and controversial figures of modern Mexico, José Vasconcelos Calderón is a complicated man. Born in 1882 in Oaxaca into a pious Catholic family, Vasconcelos had a standard upbringing until his mother died when he was only 16. After her death, the family moved to the border with America in Coahuila, leading to Vasconcelos getting an English education across the border in Eagle Pass, Texas. Becoming bilingual and learning to reject Anglo culture as the border grew unstable due to conflicts between Mexico and America, the first seedlings of his future theory of the cosmic race would be planted. Going on to an elite high school in Mexico City and later entering law school, Vasconcelos would continue to educate and immerse himself within the philosophical, ideological, and cultural movements of the wider West, and after graduating, he would find himself taking a job at an American law firm in Washington, D.C, preferring to learn in America rather than wallow under the Porfiriato which he loathed. Participating in anti-DÍaz political movements abroad, Vasconcelos returned to Mexico after DÍaz was ousted in the fires of Revolution as Madero took the presidency. Staying in Mexico until Madero’s death, Vasconcelos joined the broad movement to fight against the Huerta regime, but was forced to flee to Europe. Here he met with other cultural intellectuals and figures such as Gabrielle D’Annunzio and fellow exiles Doctor Atl and Julio Torri, further fueling his syncretic ideas until Huerta was overthrown and he could return to Mexico. \nFollowing the final victory of the Revolution, and after all the shifting sides, Vasconcelos eventually found himself on the side of the Anti-Socialists, falling in with the Synarchointegralist coalition. Due to his cultural significance, popularity, and charisma, Vasconcelos quickly rose to dethrone the Integralists’ founder and main leader Abascal and now leads the wider Integralist movement in Mexico. Far from a standard Integralist, Vasconcelos fuses revolutionary and sometimes even Liberal or Leftist thought into his wider culturally-based plan for all of Latin America and the wider world. At the forefront of his new movement is his idea of the ‘cosmic race,’ or new racial identity grounded in Ibero-American and Mestizo cultures made to stand distinct against the rest of the world in a new super-culture that will one day grow to include all of humanity in one, mixed, and syncretic racial identity dominated by the most aesthetically pleasing cultural and social traits from the wider whole. Now, with all of Mexico at his back, the Cultural Caudillo will guide the nation and all of wider Latin America towards this ultimate goal."
POLITICS_EMERGENCY_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "With Pablo Gonzalez Garza dead, cowardly assassinated by a Socialist traitor frustrated to see the Mexican people liberated, the clique of generals under his command quickly began to fight to take over the power from the late Marshal. An emergency council composed of the most distinguished officers was therefore quickly formed to prevent our beautiful country from falling into total anarchy, our countryside being already infested with Socialists waging an incessant guerrilla war.\n\nAmong the many generals taking the leadership position is Felix Diaz, nephew of the famous Porfirio, wishing to revive the glorious era of the Porfiriato, and Juan Barragan, close and confidant of Garza, who claims to want to follow in the footsteps of his late mentor.\n\nHowever, a leader must be appointed very soon if we want to prevent our country from falling into the hands of red tyrants again..."
POLITICS_GOLDSHIRTS_DESC:0 "The syndicalists tyrants were finally overthrown by the unwavering will of the Mexican people and the loyal Goldshirts! Now that the enemies of Mexico are either dead, in exile, or fighting a desperate guerrilla war, it is only fitting that the Goldshirts lead the nation.\n\nHowever, the rifts between the Young Guard and the Old Guard are resurfacing in the wake of our victory as the final vote approaches to determine who will lead us. Soon the uncertain fate of the movement and the entire Mexican nation will be decided..."
POLITICS_ASA_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "After years of intense, courageous and relentless struggle, the forces of the AAS finally managed to save Mexico from decadence and the Red peril! However, the only thing that unified our movement was the struggle against a common enemy, and now that this struggle has been completed, tensions and disputes are resurfacing among our members.\n\nWe are indeed divided between the Integralists led by Abascal and Vasconcelos who want a return to a pious monarchy and the creation of an organic society, the Synarchists led by Urquiza who want a Catholic Republic based on a National-Corporatist model, not to mention the fanatical Goldshirts who are proudly anti-Christian, themselves divided between a Young Guard wishing to transform Mexico into a hyper-centralized Neo-Aztecs state and the Old Guard promoting an alliance with the landowners and the creation of a new Mexican Nationalism, not to mention the various smaller groups that are also part of our alliance.\n\nAll these divisions cannot last forever, compromises will undoubtedly be necessary, but a solution to this tense political situation must be found quickly if we hope to save our country..."
POLITICS_SALVADOR_ABSCAL:0 "Salvador Abascal Infante, the orignal founder of the Partido Integralista Nacional, who has long played second-fiddle to the great Cultural Caudillo Vasconcelos, has finally risen to lead his Party once more. Abascal was born on May 18th, 1910 in Morelia, one of 11 children, Abascal would go on to Law school, and eventually become a judge. The Socialist wave that took control of Mexico following Zapata's Presidential Victory, as well as the exploding popularity of 'Integralist' Movements in Europe and Latin America drove Abascal to found the PIN a party which advocated the establishment of an 'Organic' Catholic Mexican Monarchy. Despite founding the party, Abascal quickly lost favor with the party as Vasconcelos joined and rose to the top of the movement, reducing Abascal to Vasconcelos' right hand man within the party. However, despite Vasconcelos' massive popularity within the party and Mexican society, Abascal has forced his mentor into a forced retirement as he takes the reigns of the party once more. Under his watch, the ideals of Organic Integralism will be implemented to their fullest extent."
POLITICS_ROQUE_GARZA_DESC:0 "Born on March 23rd 1885, Roque Victoriano González Garza has once again risen to the position of Mexican President and Commander in Chief. An early supporter and assistant of Madero, eventually joining Pancho Villa's forces after Madero was murdered. For around 5 months Roque assumed the position of Mexican President, eventually returning to private life after his term expired. After the Revolution, Roque co-founded the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista with Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco, and helped lead his movement against the revolutionary government of Zapata, notably helping raid a Syndicalist party headquarters on horseback. Now, with Zapata dead and the Goldshirts ruling over Mexico, Roque struggles within his party against the radical Carrasco and his insane Aztec-revivalist ideas, to bring stability and unity and modernity to our beloved Mexico"
POLITICS_CARRASCO_MEGA_LARP_DESC:0 "Taking the name of the first Aztec Tlaotoani and founder of the Aztec Empire Itzcoatl, Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco has abandoned his Spanish heritage entirely to embrace the true culture of Mexico. Rising to lead the restored and reforged ‘Neo-Aztec Empire,’ Itzcoatl II seeks to guide what was once Mexico into a new age free of colonial taint and foreign influences. Taking complete control of the state with the aid of his loyalists within the New Guard of the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista while betraying his once-ally Roque Garza, a new triple alliance - or Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān - has been formed; not of three different Mexica clans, but of three new pillars to uphold the new empire: faith, people, and nation. With the revived Aztec faith supporting our people and bolstering our new national identity, Itzcoatl II’s new empire shall surely not fail as the man once known as Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco takes the future of the Mexica people solely in his grasp."
POLITICS_CARRASCO_DESC:0 "Champion of the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista and the new Mexican state, Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco is the current strongman and national father of our revitalized nation. Born in Chihuahua in 1890, Carrasco was born under the shadow of the Porfiriato. Entering the national scene after a standard upbringing during the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, Carrasco initially fought alongside the likes of both Pancho Villa and Huerta, flipping sides and swapping allegiances before breaking off to form his own nationalist paramilitary that became the Gold Shirts of the ARM. Slowly growing his movement from a simple gang of nationalist brigands into a well-oiled and highly veteran military force, the ARM eventually transitioned to become a party and national movement. With his ally Roque Garza aiding him, the ARM seized power from Pablo Garza in the wake of his coup after Zapata’s assassination, and after the ARM’s own internal power struggle was concluded, Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco stood alone. Now, with all of Mexico in the palm of his hand, a new Mexico shall be forged in a baptism of fire. With his pre-colonial tastes and eccentricities well-known within the party and with no one powerful or influential enough to further provide obstacles, Carrasco plans to guide Mexico towards its classical and rightful heritage, embracing Aztec and Mexica culture while removing all traces of colonialism, Socialism, free Capitalism, and Catholicism from the nation."
POLITICS_MARIA_III_DESC:0 "Once just the youngest daughter of María Josepha Sophia de Iturbide, María Gisela Josefa Erna Isabela Tunkl-Iturbide was prepared to live an easy life as a noblewoman free from any major responsibility. Modest, devoutly pious, and reclusive from the public eye, the youngest of the three Marías lived with her mother and sister in peace. However, their calm life was abruptly ended as the Revolution was halted by General Garza and sent flying in a new, more conservative direction. As Mexico once again went through societal upheaval, our nation was rocked by political confrontations until the nationalist ARM seized power. Seeking to secure their grip on the nation, the ARM slaughtered dozens of Mexico’s most powerful and influential figures, including the mother and older sister of María Gisela. Sneaking away from the massacre as one of the few survivors, María Gisela and a small band of loyalists such as Porfirio Diaz Ortega began to plot their revenge. Allying with a fanatical cult dedicated to the Mexican Folk Catholic deity Santa Muerte, - a cult that also views María Gisela as the very embodiment of their beloved Lady of Death - María Gisela and her clique rose to prominence in Mexico’s northern wastes, waging a guerilla war against the traitorous ARM. Finally slaying those that murdered her family and seizing power themselves, María Gisela’s supporters moved to revive Mexican monarchism, proclaiming the Third Mexican Empire with her as their first Empress. Taking the regal name Maria III in reverence and respect for her slain mother and sister, this young but devoted new monarch shall lead this holy but infantile empire and her new subjects to great heights under God and the Lady of Death."
POLITICS_MARIA_III_NORMAL_DESC:0 "With the passing of her beloved mother María Josepha, the young María Ana Wilhelmina Adolfina Sofía Tunkl-Iturbide now rises as María II. Just like her mother, María Ana is a pious and traditional woman deeply devoted to the Catholic Church and her subjects, though she is not as conservative as her mother was. Expected to stray from politics like our former and foundational Empress, the new Empress María II shall rise as the new rallying figure of our Mexican monarchy as the court and administration around the Crown truly carry out the day-to-day runnings of the empire."
POLITICS_KAHLO_DESC:0 "Master artist, poet, and theorist, Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón is known nation-wide as one of the greatest Mexican artists to ever live. Born to a White father and Mestizo mother in 1907, Kahlo was afflicted and haunted by illness and disease as a young girl, but endeavored to carry on in order to support her large family. Taking to art at a young age, she constantly filled her sketchbooks and notebooks with drawings and doodles as she worked outside school to help ease the financial burden placed on her family, but always considered art to be a hobby as she wrestled with her own health issues. Working as a stenographer after graduating high school, Kahlo became the apprentice of artist Fernando Fernández, working on her artistic talent while bringing in extra cash for her kin without taking art seriously as a possible career path. This would all change though when at the age of 18, Frida was involved in a severe bus accident that would leave her body crippled for life, giving her chronic pain and health issues without end. Though this agony would have cracked lesser women, Kahlo endured, diving into her art as her condition left her bed-ridden and with little else to do. Stuck in that bed, Kahlo honed her artistic skill and political theories, developing the earliest ideas of the Mexicayotl Movement as the Mexican Revolution raged and the later Carrasco Regime rose. A supporter and ally of Pancho Villa, Emiliano Zapata, Ricardo Magón, José Vasconcelos Calderón, Vicente Toledano, Manuel Camacho, and Lázaro Cárdenas, Frida Kahlo, her life-long partner Diego Rivera, and her allies in the Triple Alliance Elite are expected to bring about an Indigenous cultural, artistic, and spiritual revival linked to ideas of non-ethnocentric and non-supremacist Indigenous Nationalism, Mexican Agrarianism, and Social Progressivism. Let us hope that the new Triple Alliance she builds is more stable, prosperous, and peaceful than the last one."
POLITICS_JUAN_BARRAGAN_DESC:0 "Born to a long line of military men, Scholars, Emperors and Presidents, including Major General Miguel Francisco Barragan, Juan Barragan Rodriguez was destined to follow in their footsteps and has become the latest in his family to reach political prominence in Mexico. As a fresh lieutenant, he took up arms against Victoriano Huerta, leading one of the most decisive battles that ushered the end of the Tragic Ten. After the end of the golpe, Barragan joined Venustiano Carranza’s General Staff, acting as a chief of the San Luis Potosi Corps. While there, Barragan met Pablo Gonzalez Garza, and the two would eventually join the Constitutionalist Army together. The heir to Carranza and Garza, the new Generallismo is likely to take an approach that mirrors the policies of his Constitutionalist roots, but some warrant that he will go even further than the brutality seen in the Tragic Ten. Succeeding General Garza after his brutal assassination, our new 'Generalissimo' Juan Barragán aims to continue everything his late predecessor stood for, continuing the Partido Auténtico de la Revolución Mexicana's iron-fisted military rule over the Mexican state."
POLITICS_FELIX_DIAZ_DESC:0 "Félix Díaz, nephew of the late Gentleman Dictator Porfirio Díaz, has come to the helm of Mexican Politics, and has brought the Porfiriato back to Mexico, in a brand new form. Under Díaz he served in various low-level positions in his uncle's regime, such as Congressman or Inspector-General of Mexico City's police. After his Uncle's regime fell he led a failed rebellion against Madero and received the death penalty, however he had his sentence commuted by Madero. Eventually fleeing into exile, first to New York and then to Havana and finally to Berlin with several other counter-revolutionary officers. Many of the exiled officers were inspired by the German Prussian Constitutional system, and believed that a Monarchy would be the most stable system for Mexico, even putting forward his cousin Porfirio Díaz Ortega as a potential candidate for Mexican Emperor, seeing him as the true heir of Porfirio Sr. Now, with Mexico firmly under Félix Díaz's grasp following General Garza's tragic death, all wonder if Mexico's new Generalissimo will restore the bring a new breed of monarchism to Mexico, or if he will bring back the Porfiriato back to Mexico, in a brand new form"
POLITICS_PORFIRIO_DIAZ_ORTEGA:0 "An unorthodox candidate for the Mexican throne, Porfirio Diaz Ortega has nonetheless become the first Mexican Emperor from a Dynasty not connected to the old Aztec Empire, or the Austrian House of Iturbide. The fourth son of General Porfirio Díaz, Ortega mainly served as an military engineer, and helped contribute to several infrastructure projects across Mexico. Upon the fall of his father to power, Ortega moved to Europe, eventually settling with his cousin Félix in Germany. There, Ortega was exposed to the growing clique of monarchist sympathizers, who pushed him as a potential candidate for the Mexican throne, a truly Mexican candidate unlike the Moctezumas or Iturbides. Being pushed heavily as a candidate by his cousin helped sway the Regency Council to crown him as Mexican Emperor, and now with the House of Díaz as Mexico's ruling Dynasty, the Porfiriato has returned to Mexico in a brad new form, despite the probable fact that a Díaz on the Mexican Throne would made the late Gentleman Dictator roll in his grave."
POLITICS_LUIS_ARCHBISHOP_DESC:0 "If there was anyone who loved democracy and loved what the Republic once had the potential to be in Mexico, that man would be Archbishop Luis María Martínez. Born on June 9, 1881, His Grace was a dutiful cleric, eventually being made an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Morelia. Following the death of Archbishop Pascual Díaz, Martínez would take his place as the preeminent Bishop within Mexico.\n\nFollowing the Synarchointegralist victory over the Revolutionary Democracy of Zapata, the new government would eventually move to make the Primate of Mexico, the Archbishop of Mexico, the supreme authority over the state. With this new found authority, His Excellency has begun to make subtly moves against the Synarchointegralist government in the hopes of restoring Democracy, daring to not act directly as to protect his power. With a clear rift growing between the Primate and the government nominally serving in his name, it will not be long until he democracy loving Bishop and the Single-Party rule of the Synarchointegralists finally come to blows. Should the Primate restore true republicanism to his beloved homeland, the future of his position as Primate will no doubt be the main question of politics, and if the Archbishop has the strength to do away with the position remains to be seen."
POLITICS_DARIO_ARCHBISHOP_DESC:0 "A man of Faith, Family and Justice, Archbishop Miguel Darío Miranda is a model Christian, and an example to all the faithful of Mexico, and also their undisputed sovereign. Born on the Feast of Saint Nicholas, December 19, 1895, before becoming the foremost Bishop within Mexico, Archbishop Miranda made a name for himself, due to both his teaching and his exemplar work in the field of Social Justice. Upon assuming the mantle of Mexico's Primate, the first and last voice within Mexico, at the direction of the Synarchointegralist government, the Archbishop set out to single handly reform Mexico's welfare and school systems. Holding no interest in actually ruling the nation, leaving most of the day to day in the hands of his 'advisors,' His Excellency spends what little time he does in politics working to rebuild the welfare and school systems to ensure they are in line with Catholic teaching, and to provide valuable and accessible education for all. Under His Grace, Mexico is quickly becoming a model Catholic nation, an example for all to follow."
POLITICS_JESUS_ARCHBISHOP_DESC:0 "If the ASA was formed to battle the growing Socialist menace in Mexico in the person of Zapata, than Archbishop José de Jesús Angulo del Valle was born to completely purge Mexico of any and all Socialist infestation and return her to her rightful King and Master. Born June 24, 1888, Archbishop del Valle dedicated his life at an early age to serving the people of God, eventually landing himself as a missionary priest in Mexico's most impoverished regions. It was during this period of his life he first fostered his Divine Anger against demonic Socialism and it's uninformed ilk. Traveling and living with the poor, His Grace claims to have seen the ones left behind by the various Socialist governments that claimed to represent them, thus birthing his nigh uncontrolled hatred for the ungodly spawn that is Socialism. Upon being appointed as uncontested Head of State of Mexico by the Synarchointegralist government, the Archbishop set out to finally bring his vision of a pure Mexico into being. Personally taking over and leading all efforts to rid Mexico of Socialism of any kind, many have begun questioning his true plans with the Synarchointegralists. Fearing that he is simply using them as a tool to purge Mexico, a thing to be discarded upon no longer need them. Regardless of his true loyal to the Synarchointegralist movement, under Primate del Valle, Mexico shall be totally cleansed of Socialist influence, or shall not be at all."

MEX_new_economic_policy_idea_desc:0 "The Nueva Política Económica, or NEP, was created by the post-Revolutionary government as an expediency measure aimed at breathing life into our war-ravaged economy. Mixing state-run Socialist and small-scale Capitalist policies together into a cohesive and syncretic economic plan, the NEP has been a shaky attempt by the new regime to forcibly bring prosperity to Mexico. Using both free market and nationalized industries and methods, the NEP has been met with mixed results, and now the nation must decide whether to continue these drastic, fused policies, or must a Great Break be organized to dive Mexico headfirst into its crimson future."

MEX_revolution_economic:0 "The Revolution’s Economic Fallout"
MEX_revolution_economic_desc:0 "The Revolución Mexicana blew apart the old order and from the ashes our new society has risen, but this crimson transformation did not come without a price. The revolution completely destabilized and reshaped the nation, and has taken a heavy toll on Mexico’s overall ability to function, primarily when it comes to our economic sector which was absolutely decimated in the conflict. Our industry was ravaged and scavenged by fighters and opportunists on all sides, roads, railways, and telegraph lines are in ruin, and those farms and ranches that weren't ransacked by Zapata's militias were burned in a Scorched Earth policy to starve out the revolution. It will take an extensive and thorough reconstruction effort to stitch the country back together again and restore Mexico's economy to working order."

MEX_revolution_military:0 "Outdated and Unmotivated Military"
MEX_revolution_military_desc:0 "Mexico has seemingly been cursed for the better part of a century with an inability to properly modernize, industrialize, or militarize, with the woefully underdeveloped state of our armed forces serving as a blatant and sore example of this ineptitude. From doctrine to logistics and even up the entire chain of command, the whole of Mexico's military might is compromised. This military inadequacy has progressed to the point that Mexico might be markedly unprepared for the realities that another major conflict would bring. \n\nWe face a harsh reality - half of our own armaments date back to the first Weltkrieg or earlier as literal museum pieces, the navy is little more than a boutique fleet defending our closest coastal waters and interior waterways, and the air force is all but non-existent. However, not all hope is lost. With the Revolution having wrested control of the nation's industry and with the increased attention paid to the nation’s domestic oil wealth, it is possible, and vital, that Mexico evolve beyond the ad hoc nature of Zapata's militias and towards a more modern and efficient military structure."

MEX_asa_rebellion:0 "Rebellion of the Alianza Antisocialista"
MEX_asa_rebellion_desc:0 "Since the Revolution toppled the regime of Victoriano Huerta and Porfirio Díaz, Mexico has seen new faces rise and fall until war hero Emiliano Zapata was elected, with each new leader attempting to drive the post-Revolutionary state into their desired direction. All along the way and regardless of who held the reigns of power, the nation has been plagued with an increasingly radicalized right-wing coalition of anti-Socialist nationalist cliques. \n\nComposed of a wide array of right-wing and far-right movements, the AAS is chiefly represented by the staunchly traditionalist militia of the Partido Nacional Integralista (PNI), the ultra-religious synarchists of the Partido Fuerza Popular (PFP) and the racial ideologues of the anti-clerical, anti-establishment Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista (ARM), and along with other smaller groups, this anti-Leftist coalition shares little in common aside from their shared hate for Socialism. While the right-wing triumvirate is far from a stable alliance, with both the PNI and PFP loudly voicing their disdain for the ARM, their presence shows an ever growing antipathy with the revolutionary government of Zapata and the Syndicalists. With their attacks only growing more bold as the Red regime continues to lord over Mexico, many fear the AAS will plunge the nation back into war. If these ultra-nationalist fifth columnists aren't dealt with swiftly, Mexico might find itself at the mercy of yet another counter-revolution."

MEX_dl_opposition:0 "Opposition from the Liga Democrática"
MEX_dl_opposition_desc:0 "Although the transition of power in Mexico to a Socialist Republic was far from peaceful, the election of 1932 that saw Zapata's rise to power meant that the ex-incumbents of the former republican establishment would once again be relegated as a fringe group, leaving them as a marginalized but very vocal political opponent dedicated to serve as a roadblock to anything the Socialist government intended to put forward. Making matters worse, it is not just the conservative right of the previous establishment that are against the government of Zapata, for many liberal and moderate politicians and parties are joining the Liga Democrática, voicing their desires for change. Harkening back to the Carrancistas of the Revolution, these republicans and constitutionalists believe the sitting government to be one step too close to mob rule. The current administration certainly has a lot of work to do to broker an accommodation with these whimpering republicans, lest the infantile Socialist regime suffer yet another setback on their path to securing Mexico's political future."

MEX_church_question:0 "The Question of the Church"
MEX_church_question_desc:0 "Since the days of the original Spanish Conquest, the presence of the Catholic Church has had a profound and ever-present influence on the culture and traditions of contemporary Mexico. Although the Syndicalist government of Zapata has made a concerted effort to secularize Mexico, the Catholic Church still holds great power over the hearts and minds of the Mexican People. It is clear that, unless some kind of an accord with the clergy and it's faithful laity is met, a more direct and forceful means of addressing the "Opiate of the People" may have to be contemplated. Until then, the secular and pious populations of our state are at each other's throats, and with baseless rumors spreading that Zapata wishes to push for full anti-clericalism as pro-Church groups continue to radicalize, Mexico has been pushed to balance on a razor’s edge."

MEX_fateful_day_desc:0 "As our brave and popularly elected President Emiliano Zapata Salazar prepares for his address to the nation, our people sit at the edge of their seats in impatient awe as this hero of the Mexican Revolution readies himself. Our noble President is to give a speech to his constituents, explaining to them his future plans for our noble people's republic. Despite his nerves, and some rumors of violent detractors being distributed throughout the crowd outside in the Zócalo, President Zapata readies himself to speak to his people. Surely nothing will go wrong on this beautiful, picturesque day..."
MEX_zapata_slain:0 "Zapata Slain!"
MEX_zapata_slain_desc:0 "Shock and horror have spread throughout the nation with the news that our President Zapata has been slain! Murdered where he stood at the podium, shot down and forced to wither away in a pool of his own blood before thousands of his loving subjects, this national hero has been reduced to a mere rotting corpse. Now, with his brother Eufemio Zapata taking temporary charge of the nation as a largely apolitical interim President, our Mexico stands at a crossroads while our foes circle like wolves, waiting for their chance to strike..."
MEX_zapata_lives:0 "The Caudillo Lives!"
MEX_zapata_lives_desc:0 "Despite the vile intentions of the gunman, President Emiliano Zapata has survived the assassination attempt during his address to the nation. Now, with the national government on high alert and paranoid about additional reactionary attacks, all of Mexico is alert and in chaos. It is now up to President Zapata and his close allies to wrest back control of Mexico."

MEX_find_the_killer_desc:0 "With the nation in turmoil and the national government in chaos, a nation-wide manhunt has begun to find the man who shot Zapata. As public enemy number one, this unknown assassin has become the most wanted man in the nation. With the paranoid government, as well as vigilantes and even would-be supporters of this mad man now on the search across the country, it is only a matter of time before the triggerman is found."
MEX_future_of_mexico:0 "The Uncertain Future of Mexico"
MEX_future_of_mexico_desc:0 "Mexico now finds itself at a crossroads. With the Zapata regime now thrown into chaos and with reactionary, republican, monarchist, and Christian groups -among others - taking this opportunity to cause mayhem once again, our once pristine people’s republic has been dragged into the chaotic pit of the unknown. The future of our nation and of our people now hangs in the balance as varied forces across the nation prepare to do battle for the heart of Mexico once more. We have no choice but to march into this abyss, ignorant to the possibilities but prepared for the unknown as best we can."

### Zapata Lives ###
MEX_zapatas_last_years:0 "Zapata Lives!"
MEX_zapatas_last_years_desc:0 "Despite the best attempt by the verminous would-be assassins, President Zapata has survived his close brush with death. Now, more determined than ever to implement his final ambitions for Mexico in his final term, the enraged and ever-dedicated Emiliano Zapata shall bring order, peace, and his brand of agrarian Socialist democracy to Mexico, no matter the obstacle or pushback. Zapata lived, Zapata lives, Zapata will live!"
MEX_declare_martial_law:0 "Declare Martial Law"
MEX_declare_martial_law_desc:0 "In order to bring order to Mexico in the wake of the calamitous assassination attempt while also seeking to snuff out his reactionary detractors once and for all, President Zapata has delcared a state of martial law. With curfews, armed patrols, the suppression of certain civil liberties, and more, Mexico has been turned into a police state nearly overnight. Though President Zapata swears it to be a temporary measure, that has still done little to assuage fears, but we have faith in Zapata to know what he is doing as he seeks to restore peace and calm to the nation."
MEX_infiltrate_goldshirts:0 "Infiltrate the Gold Shirts"
MEX_infiltrate_goldshirts_desc:0 "The Gold Shirts are a band of anti-theist, nationalist radicals and brigands functioning as a paramilitary and a loosely-organized political body that seek to spread their twisted ideology through violence and fear. In order to safely take down this vile organization, we shall send elite troops to go undercover to infiltrate the Gold Shirts and other groups within the Alianza Antisocialista. From within, we shall kill these harmful tumors before they become too dug in."
MEX_deploy_militias:0 "Deploy the Militias"
MEX_deploy_militias_desc:0 "Furthering his decree of martial law, President Zapata has ordered the many disconnected and disorganized Socialist militias under his command to spread out into the Mexican countryside in order to spread the will of Zapata as well as to keep the peace. These armed minutemen - many veterans of the Revolution themselves - shall bring order and peace back to Mexico, even if they must bring it at the end of a gun."
MEX_DL_crackdown:0 "Crackdown on the LD"
MEX_DL_crackdown_desc:0 "The Liga Democrática is a corrosive force of Liberal, Conservative, and Reactionary democrats banded together in hopes of restoring a non-Socialist republican democracy here in Mexico. Though some among their ranks are ideologically similar to our ranks, they are still traitors to the Revolution, and as such, we must crackdown on their activities at once. From banning their parties to restricting their right to organize, we shall crush these naive and corrupt republicans as we show them the true meaning of democracy."
MEX_reassure_populace:0 "Reassure the Masses"
MEX_reassure_populace_desc:0 "Though our administration has taken steps recently that may seem uncharacteristic of Zapata and his originally stated goals for Mexico, that has only been done in the face of such calamity so as to preserve stability in our society. We must reassure the masses of this truth, and promise them that an end to these restrictions and drastic temporary measures will soon come to an end. All we must do first is finally and fully secure Mexico."
MEX_supervise_ejidos:0 "Expand the Ejido Program"
MEX_supervise_ejidos_desc:0 "The collectivized and cooperative farming plan aimed at increasing production and worker quality of life known as the Ejido system has been one of the hallmarks of the Zapata administration, with the President pushing for their expansion, use, and greater funding since he first took office. However, now in a temporary position of unmatched power and authority, Zapata has taken the opportunity to finally double-down on the Ejido programs active within the nation. Nearly all agricultural production shall soon be tied to this system in one way or another as the President finally achieves his dream of nation-wide agricultural reform."
MEX_socialist_democracy_secured:0 "Socialist Democracy Secured?"
MEX_socialist_democracy_secured_desc:0 "Through harsh methods and tough choices, President Zapata has finally secured peace and order in Mexico once again following the attempt on his life, but at what cost. Civil liberties have been suffocated under martial law as the streets and badlands run red with the blood of our reactionary enemies. The jails are filled with democratic agitators, and the Ejido system - once voluntary and optional - is now choking out every other sector of our agricultural industry. Though Mexico is at peace, and though we may prosper, it has been achieved through a compromise on Zapata’s original image - a compromise he forged himself as he bastardized his own ideas. Socialist Democracy has been secured, but as Zapata’s final term slowly comes to its end, many wonder how he will be remembered - as the Hero of the Mexican Revolution, or as a tyrant that allowed his own mortal fears to cause him to become what he hated. Perhaps his party, or another, can resolve this dichotomy in the next elections."

## Democratic League Initial ##
MEX_DL_dl_victorious:0 "Victory of the Liga Democrática!"
MEX_DL_dl_victorious_desc:0 "With the forces of authoritarianism and radical Socialism now laid to rest, the Liga Democrática - or Democratic League - has risen as the heralds of our new future. Mexico shall once again know the liberty and freedom associated with true and fair democracy as we move forward to create a pure republican system. With the wide and varied democratic coalition that is the DL creating a provisional government to guide Mexico through the process of democratization, soon the bedrock of our new republic shall be decided upon and laid as we slowly march to create a new constitution and hold our first free elections."
MEX_DL_military_question:0 "The Military Question"
MEX_DL_military_question_desc:0 "With our national history of military coups, revolutions, war, and violence being so prolific in the minds of all members of the DL, this temporary governing body has decided to reorganize our armed forces into a modern apolitical military. However, what to do with our former generals has caused quite the internal debate. We must decide to simply force the Old Guard to retire, or possibly allow them a each a pardon if they agree to disavow any and all political ties they may have once held. Regardless, we must foster a strong next generation of generals and admirals as we build a loyal and apolitical force to defend the nation."
MEX_DL_restore_the_monarchy:0 "Restore the Monarchy"
MEX_DL_restore_the_monarchy_desc:0 "After fierce debate and almost-violent argumentation between ministers within the Liga Democrática, the future executive structure of the nation has finally been decided. Shocking many, and deeply angering the more liberal and progressive ministers within the provisional government under the DL, it has been decided that the Mexican monarchy - not seen since 1867 - shall once again rise to grace this Earth. Supported heavily by members within the PRUN and PAN, a new imperial system based upon the First Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide shall rise from Mexico City and stretch to all corners of our nation. Now, all that is left to do is lay the groundwork of this new monarchy before we are able to crown our new King and Emperor, and before we can hold parliamentary elections."
MEX_DL_term_limits:0 "Parliamentary Term Limits"
MEX_DL_term_limits_desc:0 "We cannot allow ‘democratically’ elected leaders to continue to control the course of the nation for decades at a time, for that would only steal power away from our eventual sovereign and the people as it amasses in the hands of corrupt republicans. Due to the nature of parliamentary politics, elected Prime Ministers will have one shot at re-election during their term and, unless a snap election is called, they are held every 5 years. In effect, this means the maximum amount of time a Prime Minister can serve is 10 years, though they can always be recalled early by the parliament or by our monarch if need be. Along with this, all members elected to Parliament can only serve up to two terms, be it consecutive or otherwise. This will ensure that no elected official can cement themselves into the halls of power for too long, and that at the end of the day, the monarch will have the greatest say in any debate."
MEX_DL_constitutional_monarchy:0 "An Enlightened Constitutional Monarchy"
MEX_DL_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "Though we march to restore the monarchy in all its glory, we cannot let it fall prey to the same ills that plagued it in the past. Though our first empire was a constitutional monarchy on paper, it was plagued by a parliament that did not want to compromise or cooperate, leading to the old monarchy being ineffectual, hamstrung by legal challenges, and eventually to it being deposed in just over a year. We must right these past wrongs, and work to create a monarchy that truly obeys the constitution and a parliament that only aids the monarchy in their shared duty of caring for the people and the state."
MEX_DL_apolitical_judges:0 "Apolitical Judicial Practices"
MEX_DL_apolitical_judges_desc:0 "In order to build a fair and unbiased judicial system, we must only allow apolitical judges from ever serving on the bench. From the lowest county court to the Supreme Court of Justice, all hopeful judiciaries must disavow any and all political connections before being sworn in, and must stay politically-detached and unbiased for the length of their service, lest they be found out as biased charlatans and removed from office by the monarchy."
MEX_DL_a_new_constitution:0 "Draft a New Constitution"
MEX_DL_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "The vile constitution penned after the vitriolic Mexican Revolution is a putrid document of Liberal naivety and Socialist infection. We cannot allow this deeply flawed document to form the basis of our new constitutional monarchy. Instead, the majority of delegates within the DL have decided that a new constitution is to be drafted from scratch, based slightly on our first constitution penned at the Congress of Anahuac, as well as drawing influence from the German and old 1906 Russian constitutions as well. Enshrining what it means to be Mexican in our newly restored Empire, this new constitution will form the framework of our modern monarchy."

MEX_DL_mass_exiling_desc:0 "Though we have taken control of the nation and begun to cement the authority of our reborn monarchy, Socialist vermin and anti-monarchist elements still roam the nation as bandits, criminals, or loud-mouthed detractors. In order to stabilize the realm and to rid ourselves of these parasites, we shall legally exile them all from our borders. Our loyal troops shall roam the nation in search of those foolish enough not to leave on their own accord, and drive these rats from our restored empire."
MEX_DL_the_kingdom_of_mexico:0 "A Monarchy Reborn"
MEX_DL_the_kingdom_of_mexico_desc:0 "Like it was 1822 or 1864 all over again, monarchism has been brought back to Mexico like a phoenix from the ashes. Though we have yet to name our monarch - though it is likely to be Maria Josefa de Iturbide, the preparations are well underway as we announce to our people and the world that the Third Mexican Empire - or if we so choose, the new Kingdom of Mexico - now rises from the ashes of its predecessor. With Socialist bandits still roaming the nation and with the parliamentary framework of our new government still being established, this is but a first step on the road to our new destiny."
MEX_DL_enter_the_cities:0 "Cleanse the Cities"
MEX_DL_enter_the_cities_desc:0 "The many cities of our nation, from Mexico City to Tijuana, serve as dens for our detractors and hives of Socialist unrest. In order to prepare the nation for republicanism, each and every city in the nation shall be patrolled and cleansed of violent partisans and bandits. Only with our major urban population centers under our control can we truly begin to effectively and efficiently administer this nation in full."
MEX_DL_secure_the_countryside:0 "Corral the Countryside"
MEX_DL_secure_the_countryside_desc:0 "Though our cities may be slowly coming under our control, the countryside of Mexico is still a wild and lawless place. With mesas, deserts, mountain ranges, jungles, and more wild expanses crawling with enemies of the state, we must march in our loyal troops in order to secure these hinterlands. Republicanism shall stretch to reach every corner of Mexico, and we shall ensure it through any means necessary, for no one can tame these wilds but us."
MEX_DL_democracy_secured:0 "Democracy Secured"
MEX_DL_democracy_secured_desc:0 "With our cities leashed and our countryside tamed, democracy has been secured in this wild land. Republicanism is now free to flourish in our newly cleansed nation, and any foe large enough to form an obstacle to this free and fair destiny has been dealt with through legislation or by the protectors of the state. Now, Mexico and its people march into their new, equal destiny, without fear of retaliation from our violent detractors."
MEX_DL_maintain_the_presidency:0 "Maintain the Presidency"
MEX_DL_maintain_the_presidency_desc:0 "Though past presidents have certainly failed this nation and our people, that is not to say that the idea of a presidential republic is flawed - just that the men we have allowed to rule in the past have had their own interests at heart instead of the needs and will of their constituents. To rectify these past grievances against democracy, we shall keep the position of President, and ensure that only sound, uncorrupt men come to hold the position. Only then, with a paragon of republican justice holding the reigns of power, can our democratic republic and our nation truly be free."
MEX_DL_presidential_republic:0 "An Illuminated Presidential Republic"
MEX_DL_presidential_republic_desc:0 "Republicanism is the most noble and fair system of governance in history, and we shall wrap Mexico in the warm embrace of democracy in order to bring this noble system to our own people. Centered around an elected president and with a uncorrupt congress at their back, our government shall rise above the ills of the past to guide our new Mexican Republic into a fair and free future."
MEX_DL_prohibit_reelections:0 "Prohibit Re-Elections"
MEX_DL_prohibit_reelections_desc:0 "In order to safeguard democracy for generations to come, the same elected leaders will not be allowed to dominate the political landscape for decades. Going forwards, all future Presidents of Mexico shall only be allowed to rule for one term of a yet-undetermined length. After their term is up, or if removed from power by congress early, it will be up to their leading party to raise another candidate to take their place in the following elections. With this policy in place, no longer shall ‘democratically’ elected presidents be able to rule for years without competition or pushback."
MEX_DL_reform_the_constitution:0 "Reform the Constitution"
MEX_DL_reform_the_constitution_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Constitution signed after the conclusion of the Mexican Revolution may have its flaws, and may reek of Socialism’s taint, but it stands as a stable framework for the ministers of the Democratic League to build off of. By editing this tainted document to fit our needs and by incorporating our own ideas of fair republicanism, as well as notes from the American, Brazilian, and Canadian constitutions, we shall forge a new and reformed document ready to serve as the foundation for our new democracy."
MEX_DL_democratic_judges:0 "A Democratic Judiciary"
MEX_DL_democratic_judges_desc:0 "To keep our judiciary free of corruption and wholly dedicated to upholding democratic virtues and freedoms, all judges in the nations, from the Supreme Court of Justice all the way down to the smallest county court, must be sworn and dedicated members of one of our allowed democratic parties - though while on the bench they will be expected to leave all biases at the door. In this way, we shall hopefully keep radical influences and corruption from seeping into our justice system while providing fair, unfettered justice to any and all in the nation."
MEX_DL_the_republic_of_mexico:0 "A Republic Reaffirmed"
MEX_DL_the_republic_of_mexico_desc:0 "Like the noble and free eagle that soars across our skies, serving as one of the oldest symbols of our nation, our newly reforged republic too freely soars as fair and free democracy is brought to the people of Mexico. Under the provisional unity government of the Liga Democrática, republicanism is finally free to blossom and flourish across our lands. With the constitutional convention and later our first fair elections both looming, soon the voices of the Mexican people shall finally be heard and heeded."
MEX_DL_mass_arrests:0 "Traitors to Stand Trial"
MEX_DL_mass_arrests_desc:0 "Though we have allowed open elections, only banning the most radical of groups and allowing even moderate Socialists to freely compete, our nation is still filled with anti-democratic elements from both sides of the aisle that seek to smother our infantile republic before it can truly take flight. To preemptively deal a vital blow to these groups, loyal soldiers and police forces shall be sent into the badlands to capture these banditos and bring them to justice. Only behind bars, or if they run a shallow grave, can these vile Socialist and reactionary radicals truly be of no threat to our democracy."
MEX_DL_emergency_elections:0 "Convocar un Nuevo Congreso Constituyente"
MEX_DL_emergency_elections_desc:0 "With true democracy finally returning to our Mexico, a new Constituent Congress has convened to draft a new Constitución Política de México - or Political Constitution of Mexico. From our first independent congress under the Spanish -  the Congress of Anahuac - to the liberal Constitution of 1857, and even to our most recent one drafted in the wake of the Mexican Revolution, constitutionalism has been deeply embedded into Mexican ideals of republicanism and democracy for centuries. With our ministers and politicians convening in the capital to draft this hallowed document before our first elections can be held, the nation awaits eagerly for the official birth of our reforged republican system!"

Though there have been some minor security concerns, Garza cares not, for the savior of Mexico seeks to speak to his people, and we must oblige. Let us hope that this speech is remembered for years to come as Pablo Garza seeks to remold Mexico in his image."

MEX_deciding_our_destiny_desc:0 "With Garza solidifying his hold over the Mexican government more and more with each passing day, the time has finally come for this hero of Mexico to decide the future path and structure of this reforged nation. Will he follow the legacy of the great Porfirio, or will he step into a new legacy all his own?"
MEX_never_again:0 "Never Another Porfirio!"
MEX_never_again_desc:0 "Shunning the tainted legacy of the liberal dictator Porfirio Díaz, General Garza has begun to style himself as his own brand of strongman President. Seeking to shackle a puppeted sham democracy under his own brand of militarist and conservative Republicanism, Garza will blaze a new path forward for Mexico entirely free of past mistakes."
MEX_the_president_approving_candidates:0 "The President’s Approved ‘Candidates’"
MEX_the_president_approving_candidates_desc:0 "Moving to fulfill his ambition of puppeting democratic practices behind the facade of a strong and unified Mexican political system, President Garza has allowed other parties to participate in our Republic. However, each party and candidate must be approved by Garza behind the scenes, ensuring that only allies and friends of the President ‘run’ against him. This shall ensure the continued domination of the Garza Administration while putting on enough of a democratic show to appease and quiet the masses."
MEX_convince_the_judges:0 ""Coerce the Courts"
MEX_convince_the_judges_desc:0 "Through bribery and blackmail, intimidation or quiet ‘replacements’ and early retirements, President Garza shall bend the Judiciary of Mexico to his whims and will. The Supreme Court of Mexico shall be a loyal, chained dog to Garza’s regime, ensuring only the laws he supports pass while also guaranteeing that all his enemies meet true justice as defined by Garza."
MEX_arrest_them_all:0 "Arrest All Detractors"
MEX_arrest_them_all_desc:0 "All across Mexico, detractors, radicals, and firebrands spread toxic lies about our regime and about President Garza. We must move to silence these vermin lest they do permanent damage to our regime’s image. Each and every one of these traitors shall be arrested and imprisoned, where they can do hard labor or stare at the walls as they contemplate their infectious deeds."
MEX_a_strong_presidency:0 "Hide Executive Powers"
MEX_a_strong_presidency_desc:0 "The position of the executive must be the strongest and most dominant political position with Mexico if our Republic is to function in an orderly manner without unnecessary obstacles and hitches, but that does not mean we must be obvious about it. Though President Garza must play the part of a President bound by elections and checks and balances, we shall know the truth. Behind closed doors, it is President Garza and only Garza who has any authoritative or final say, and it is this fact that must be hidden from the masses at all costs."
MEX_revisit_the_constitution:0 "Revisit the Constitution"
MEX_revisit_the_constitution_desc:0 "Seeking to undo the damage of the Revolution without throwing out the entirety of this foundational document - a move that would anger millions across Mexico - it has been decided that we shall edit the current Constitution to fit our needs. With President Garza’s oversight and constant input, a new Constitution shall be amalgamated from edited aspects of the previous document."
MEX_a_presidential_republic:0 "A Presidential ‘Republic’"
MEX_a_presidential_republic_desc:0 "With sham democracy shackled to the whims of the executive and with the legislature and judiciary within his pocket as well, President Garza has created his own vision of Mexican Republicanism. This new Republic without democracy behind a facade of unity and cohesion has done the hard things necessary to bring order and peace to our nation. Now, may President Garza lead us to new prosperity as he guides Mexico by his hand alone."
MEX_send_in_the_army:0 "Military Peacekeeping Operations"
MEX_send_in_the_army_desc:0 "Utilizing his deep links to the armed forces, President Garza has authorized the usage of military peacekeeping operations within urban centers and other hotspots of anti-Garza rhetoric. Through intimidation, and violence too if need be, these proud Mexican patriots shall serve the President loyally and without devotion as they use rifle and saber to bring order and peace to Mexico."
MEX_secure_the_countryside:0 "Pacify the Countryside"
MEX_secure_the_countryside_desc:0 "With our armed forces deployed to the cities and other population centers or industrial zones, the time has come to turn our attention to the countryside. All across the rural expanse of Mexico are thousands of small communities, isolated villages, and other disparate populations - many of whom control and operate our agricultural sector. In order to maintain food supplies while also consolidating Garza’s hold over all of Mexico."
MEX_mexico_secured:0 "Mexico within Pablo’s Palms"
MEX_mexico_secured_desc:0 "President Pablo Garza has brought law, order, and security to the vast and wild expanses of Mexico. Though he may have used harsh and shadowy tactics, these were necessary steps that had to be done in order to truly bring peace and prosperity to the masses. Now that the hard part is done, President Garza shall continue to consolidate all of Mexico within the palm of his hand in order to bring glory to both himself and to his new republic."
MEX_a_new_diaz:0 "The New Díaz!"
MEX_a_new_diaz_desc:0 "Seeking to recapture the golden age that was the Porfiriato, President Pablo Garza has decided to embrace the legacy of the late liberal autocrat President Porfirio Díaz. Borrowing from Díaz’s policies while adding in his own twists and ideas, President Garza will fuse old ideas with new lessons learned in order to drag this war-torn nation back towards greatness."
MEX_an_imperial_presidency:0 "An Imperial Presidency"
MEX_an_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "In an authoritarian and paternalistic system that borders on imperial majesty, President Garza will emulate the emperor-like attitude and powers exercised during the Porfiriato. As the unquestioned leader and guide of the nation, Garza shall use his wise intuition and vast experience to make the hard decisions Mexico needs to make, all without being bothered by obstacles such as checks and balances."
MEX_completely_new_constitution:0 "Forge a New Constitution"
MEX_completely_new_constitution_desc:0 "In order to truly bring the ideas of Díaz back to life, a new Constitution shall be written, custom-tailored to align with the ideas of the Porfirio while be adapted to the modern realities of post-Revolution and post-counter-revolution Mexican society. With this new document, the very framework and foundation of this new imperial-inspired republic shall rise according to the doctrine of Díaz filtered through the contemporary filter of Garza."
MEX_the_new_pabliriato:0 "Usher in the ‘Pabliriato’"
MEX_the_new_pabliriato_desc:0 "In a move declared grossly ambitious and disrespectful by many archaic fossils within the old guard, President Garza has begun to raise his own cult of personality as Díaz once did, going so far to being using the term ‘Pabliriato’ - a play on the term Porfiriato used to describe the 31-year long reign of former President Díaz. This ultimate move to emulate the Díaz government shall fully marry our new Mexican republic to the ideas of our past golden age while pairing them to the image of President Garza. Perhaps even with time, the Pabliriato will come to eclipse its predecessor as the true Mexican golden age."
MEX_reestablish_reelections:0 "Reestablish Re-Elections"
MEX_reestablish_reelections_desc:0 "In order to keep peace and faith within his government, President Garza has allowed for re-elections to return to Mexican Republicanism. Though his own position shall be quietly secured with rigging and tampering, the other positions in Mexican local and national government shall be open to elections. However, term lengths for most positions is to be anywhere from 5 to 10 years, and the only figures with any real chances of winning shall be only those the President allows, though all this and more will be kept dark from the public. With these steps, we shall create the illusion of free democracy while ensuring President Garza’s dominance."
MEX_executive_over_the_judiciary:0 "A Judiciary Under the Executive"
MEX_executive_over_the_judiciary_desc:0 "In order to ensure there are no obstacles in the way of President Garza’s ambitions while also ensuring his enemies are dealt with in a legal manner, the judicial system shall be fully shackled to the executive branch. With the courts at his beck and call, powerless to deny him his every whim, President Garza shall have an incomparable ability to manipulate all of Mexican society to match his vision."
MEX_execute_them_all:0 "No Quarter for Traitors"
MEX_execute_them_all_desc:0 "Traitors to the state lost their right to jury and mercy the moment they began conspiring against the President.

All hail Garza, all hail the new Mexico!"

MEX_JUNTA_death_of_the_marshall_desc:0 "Tragic news has rung out across all of Mexico as Generalissimo Pablo Garza - the man who saved Mexico from the vile post-Revolution government - finally passes away. Leading the interim government as its chief strongman and trailblazer, our movement now flounders and fractures with the loss of the great Marshal as Mexico City erupts into chaos. Now it is up to us to stabilize the nation, set a course towards peace, and decide the future of Mexico in his stead, wherever that might lead us."
MEX_JUNTA_an_emergency_session:0 "An Emergency Session"
MEX_JUNTA_an_emergency_session_desc:0 "With Garza dead and with the initial chaos over his death now subsiding within Mexico City, an emergency session of the national government has been called in order to decide the future political and organizational structure of our new Mexican state as the rest of the nation further collapses into disarray. With competing factions and ideologies vying for power in order to decide the nation’s fate as it all crumbles around us, all must be in attendance and ready for a long round of debate, because we are not leaving the Capitol until this matter is finally put to rest."
MEX_JUNTA_maintain_the_plan:0 "Trust in the ‘Republican’ Plan"
MEX_JUNTA_maintain_the_plan_desc:0 "In unsurprising news, the strongly militarist Republican faction of the emergency congress has won out. These generals and conservative politicians - most with links to PARM - have decided to bring the original plan set by Pablo Garza to pass. As such, a new Mexican Republic shall be born - one free of the Liberal and Democratic vices that ruined the past attempts at such a system - under a paternalistic and authoritarian executive position, and backed by the mighty Mexican military."
MEX_JUNTA_restore_the_presidency:0 "Re-Empower the Presidency"
MEX_JUNTA_restore_the_presidency_desc:0 "The Presidency is as much of a title as it is a position, and as such it shall be restored to its former glory so that our executive may command the respect, attention, and loyalty it deserves. The title of President should hold the same prestige and power as it did during the Porfiriato or other great periods of autocratic Mexican history. This hallowed position must be empowered and raised to new heights so that all in Mexico obey our President’s commands and ambitions for the State."
MEX_JUNTA_rewrite_the_constitution:0 "Adapt the Old Constitution"
MEX_JUNTA_rewrite_the_constitution_desc:0 "The previous, pre-Revolution Constitutions of 1824 and 1857 were almost perfect on their own. However, they fell prey to certain democratic and progressive traps that would certainly spell doom for our new Mexican Republic. As such, we shall move to adapt these old, proven, but slightly flawed documents in order to provide a new framework for our new form of Mexican non-Democratic Republicanism."
MEX_JUNTA_a_presidential_republic:0 "A Presidential ‘Republic’"
MEX_JUNTA_a_presidential_republic_desc:0 "A new breed of Mexican Republicanism has been born under our stewardship - one inspired by the conservative Liberalism and paternalistic nature of the Porfiriato that also abstains from national-level democratic practices under the uncompromising vision of an incredibly strong executive position. With a legislature and the judiciary system shackled to this new executive, the idea of checks and balances has been replaced by the ingenious guidance of our chosen President. Long live the President, and long live the new Mexican republic!"

MEX_JUNTA_elections_every_10_years_desc:0 "Though largely sworn off from democratic practices at the national level, a compromise has been reached with vocal opponents to such a strong executive as our new system demands. Each President shall be elected for 10 years at a time, while term-limits have been done away with for the executive seat. This system shall ensure that our chosen President can lead without obstruction or obstacle so that they may see their ambitions and plans come to fruition, while also paying lip service to those who decry our constant efforts to further empower the Presidency."
MEX_JUNTA_reduce_judicial_independence:0 "Shackle the Judiciary"
MEX_JUNTA_reduce_judicial_independence_desc:0 "The Mexican Supreme Court and its lower courts have always been problematic, constantly getting in the way of Presidential ambitions for decades and throughout numerous different regimes. Though many of them mean well, simply wishing to see their version of Justice ring true, many more are simply corrupt ideologues or sellouts, fulfilling their own ambitions and stuffing their own pockets to the detriment of all Mexican society. These judges must be shackled to and subservient to the newly empowered executive position. Only then will they be unable to pursue their selfish and greedy goals, instead forced to be loyal servants and aides to the President."
MEX_JUNTA_strict_punishments:0 "Strict Punishments and Swift Justice"
MEX_JUNTA_strict_punishments_desc:0 "With the Judiciary shackled to the whims of the Presidency, we are now free to pursue our own righteous concepts of justice. The new legal system for Mexico shall be rather simple, and strict to ensure maximum effectiveness of our edicts and punishments. All first offenders for any felony shall face temporary imprisonment, while a second offense will doll out longer prison sentences coupled with hard labor. However, any of those foolish or brazen enough to meet a third offense, or simply if they commit a crime deemed severe enough, then all that shall await them is a swift death before meeting true Justice before God."
MEX_JUNTA_dominate_the_cities:0 "Subjugate the Cities"
MEX_JUNTA_dominate_the_cities_desc:0 "Though Mexico City has been brought back under our control, large cities, urban centers, and other population centers all across Mexico rage against our new government. We must bring order to these vital nodes that dot across our vast expanse, for these cities hold the bulk of our population and industry, and without them there is no Mexico."
MEX_JUNTA_secure_the_countryside:0 "Tame the Hinterlands"
MEX_JUNTA_secure_the_countryside_desc:0 "With order being brought to the cities, one way or another, it is now time to begin taming the rural wildlands of Mexico. Though sparsely populated and resistant to integration, with many isolated or intensely rural regions holding more loyalty to the Church over any barely-seen government, this vast swathe of varied terrain holds the bulk of our agricultural production. As an army marches on its stomach, so too does a nation, and so we must bring order to these badlands and boondocks in order to secure Mexico and its future. "

MEX_JUNTA_stability_desc:0 "Mexico has been brought to order, relatively, by our hand and through our might. Many may still resist the radical changes we have made to Mexico in such a short period of time, but the majority of the masses are beginning to see things our way. Though there is still much work to be done, and though we still have unrest to quell, we have achieved a level of effective governance not seen for years in these lands, so now let us continue this great labor as we further carry Mexico to greatness."

MEX_JUNTA_a_monarchist_alternative_desc:0 "In a surprising turn of events that shocked many in the nation and the emergency congressional session, the monarchist proposal first tabled by General Félix Díaz has come out on top against their once-dominant Republican rivals.

MEX_JUNTA_only_removed_by_a_vote_of_noconfidence_desc:0 "The position of Chancellor shall serve as the right-hand of the new monarch, sworn to serve the masses and the Crown with unwavering dedication and loyalty. A man so entrusted with such power cannot be expected to abide by normal laws, nor can they be impeded in their service to the restored Throne. As such, the only way for a Chancellor to be removed from office without a formal resignation will be by a Vote of No-Confidence held by the new Parliament and then accepted by the Crown. This shall ensure that no removal is hasty or poorly throughout, cementing national power within the hands of the Crown and the Chancellor below it."
MEX_JUNTA_bribe_the_judges:0 "’Justice’ Greased by Graft"
MEX_JUNTA_bribe_the_judges_desc:0 "The Supreme Court of Mexico and the justices of its various lower courts have long been against a monarchist restoration, being among the most ardent supporters of the failed Republican faction. However, with the corruption and greed within their ranks being a well-known secret, perhaps an increase in their wages and some cushy incentives can change their tune. With the Judiciary in the pocket of the Crown, there shall be no legal obstacles to our righteous edicts."

MEX_JUNTA_a_strict_code_of_law_desc:0 "Though the Judiciary is in our pocket, that doesn't mean they still cannot do their jobs! In order to aid the ambitions and motions of the Crown and the Chancellor, the Mexican legal code shall be redrafted, ensuring our just laws are harsh on the real enemies of the Crown and the people while being malleable to meet the fluctuating needs of the monarchy. This new move must be respected, for it is necessary to ensure the Crown can rule without issue, and as such this new legal code shall have a stricter enforcement than ever before without second chances."

MEX_JUNTA_a_title_for_the_leader_desc:0 "Though we have decided to restore a Mexican monarchy, the nature of this monarchy is still to be determined. One of the most defining debates we need to resolve first is as to what the title of our new monarch should be. We could look towards past glories and revive the old imperial system under a new Emperor or Empress, or we could look to new glories free from past mistakes, making the first true Mexican Kingdom under our chosen King or Queen. Whatever we decide on, it shall come to form the very identity of the Crown and the nation, and so we must choose carefully."
MEX_JUNTA_a_new_constitution:0 "Pen a New Constitution"
MEX_JUNTA_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "In order to accommodate this new monarchist system, a new Constitution must be drafted entirely free of past mistakes. Drawing inspiration from similar documents drafted in Vienna and Berlin, we shall handcraft a new framework form-fit for our new realities. This process shall be guided by the leading figure of the Monarchist faction  General Félix Díaz, and by his hand this new document, ‘La Constitución de Mexicana’, shall rise to nurture and support the restored Crown."
MEX_JUNTA_a_constitutional_monarchy:0 "A ‘Constitutional’ Monarchy"
MEX_JUNTA_a_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "Our monarchy shall be bound to the new Constitution in theory, but in practice, the Crown and the Chancellor shall rule Mexico as they see fit, taking the recently penned document as more of a suggestion than final law.

However, with this restoration comes many questions that must be answered - most pressing of which is who should reign as our first monarch on this restored throne, and what should be the system and ideas we impose under this crown? With questions like these and many more, we must tread carefully as we move to choose a monarch and a future direction for our new Mexico."

The reigning Duke of Moctezuma, Luis has the purple blood of Spanish nobility and Aztec royalty within his veins, being the direct descendant of Emperor Moctezuma II, the ninth Tlatoani of the old Aztec Empire. With this heritage, it is the Duke’s birthright to hold this title, this crown, and this throne, so by God we shall grant it to him, once again putting a Moctezuma in charge of Mexico."

As the fourth, and only surviving, adult son of the titanic founding father of modern Mexico Porfirio Díaz, ‘Porfirito’ as his father called him shall now lead the nation as Porfirio I of the newly established House of Díaz.

However, seeking to draw attention to his ancestor and perhaps the greatest Aztec Emperor of all, Emperor Luis has raised Moctezuma I up as his chief inspiration and new symbol of the restored monarchy. Unlike his descendent Moctezuma II who waged war and expanded the Empire to its maximum extent, Moctezuma I ruled over a period of unprecedented peace within the Triple Alliance. This era of peace saw great scientific, cultural, spiritual, and economic advances that would raise the Triple Alliance as an empire not only of bloodshed, sacrifice, and conquest, but one of sound governance and brilliant advancements that led to the greatest golden age the empire would experience before eventually falling to the Spanish. It is this legacy that Mocetezuma I created, one of peace, progress, and prosperity, that our new Empire shall strive to emulate."

We must smooth over relations between the Hispanic and Nahua-speaking populations, along with all the other indigenous peoples of Mexico, in order to build a truly cohesive society.

If that is the case, we can show his sick little posse how the Spanish tamed the fangs of Quetzalcoatl with more than just the Cross.

We shall move to revitalize and spread the Anahuac culture, or the modernist, Socialist, and indigenously-rooted culture of Mexico City to the wider nation, creating a cosmopolitan Amerindian culture for all Mexicans to embrace and cherish."

MEX_conserve_native_church_desc:0 "The Native Mexican Church is the proposed spiritual body that seeks to combine certain Christian ideas and practices with the faith and culture of the indigenous Nahuatl peoples. First formed as a confederation of multiple Kalpulli, or Socialist communes echoing indegenous cultural practices, and now stands as the most rapidly growing religion in Mexico. We shall move to officially support this new syncretic faith and help it to spread throughout Mexico in hopes that we can amend the difference between our two distinct cultural halves."
MEX_house_of_sun:0 "Praise the House of the Sun"
MEX_house_of_sun_desc:0 "The House of the Sun, also called the In Kaltonal, is the Nahautl term for the Native Mexican Church, and describes the sun worship typical in the religion. With the religion spreading throughout Mexico quite rapidly due to it appeasing both the Christian and Indigenous halves of our society, we shall go ahead and name this new faith the state religion of Mexico. All the old folk saints and Vatican-ordained saints shall be transferred over to this new faith, given traditional names, and paired to similar Aztec and Toltec deities. We will build a new religion accepted by all and dominant throughout all Mexico in order to unite the people and the culture like never before."

MEX_aztec_elite_desc:0 "The group of artists, intellectuals, and philosophers that truly rule the nation behind the unifying visage of the Great Tōltēcātl and Tecuichpoch Frida Kahlo are named the Aztec Triple Alliance Elite. So named after the original Aztec Empire’s true name, this cabal of thinkers, cultural titans, and revolutionary heroes are the true governing and administrative force behind the new regime. By their will and by their secretive word, the new Mexicayotl Movement and the new Mexico bends to their whim, and with the nationally beloved Kahlo as the face of this clique, none shall stand it our way as we progress Mexican society away from the preposterous lunacy of Carrasco and the ARM and towards the light of Indigenous Socialism."

MEX_lost_languages_desc:0 "The Uto-Aztekan language group describes the multitude of languages used by both the citizens of the Aztec Empire and the wider nations, clans, tribes, and other human settlements around them. Stretching from the American Southwest to northern Central America, this language family is as diverse as it is ancient. We shall move to revive all the languages of this ethnolinguistic family, particularly among the Nahautl subgroup. Though it will take many, many years and tons of effort, we shall slowly work to replace the dominance of Spanish-borne Mexican with the indiegnous tongues of the People."
MEX_mexican_values:0 "Indigenous Culture and Mexican Values"
MEX_mexican_values_desc:0 "As we progress towards this new conception of indigenous values and culture, we should be careful to never forget the history and odyssey that brought us to our current realities. Though we are native at heat, Spanish imperialism and European colonization still runs hot in our blood and in our history. Instead of burying this past and pretending it never happened, we shall move to reconcile the damage and benefits this unique path has brought us as we work to fuse our Mexican and European-borne reality with our Indigneous history."
MEX_modern_agrarianism:0 "Archaic Agrarianism Made Modern"
MEX_modern_agrarianism_desc:0 "Tweaking the long-standing Ejido system to fit the needs of the People, we shall move to usher in a new agricultural revolution in Mexico. Mechanization and modernization shall be the name of the game as we try to bail Mexico out of the Dark Ages and into the contemporary age. By modernizing the agricultural practices of our ancestors, such as the Chiampa system, and pairing it with new technological advances, we shall build an agrarian economy to be the envy of all other Agrarian regimes around the world."

MEX_recreate_kalpulli_desc:0 "The Kalpulli were native communes and communities that worked in a sort of proto-feudalist and proto-communalist system, providing food, manpower, sacrifices, and other supplies for the Toltec and Aztec empires, along with other Mesoamerican communities, while the main city-states, or altepetl, oversaw the production and administration of urban goods and services. We shall work to modernize and incorporate this system of Kalpulli communes working in unison with Altepetl urban centers, creating an efficient, egalitarian, and anti-authoriaian system of societal organization where each settlement and commune specializes and works in tandem with their constituent parts - a true Socialist and semi-Anarchist system invented centuries before the writings and theories of Marx realized once more."

MEX_rebuild_lost_empire_desc:0 "The Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān, or Triple Alliance, was the greatest civilization the New World ever saw. Excelling at war, science, civic planning and administration, and agriculture, and growing to become the dominant culture and religious force of their region, the original Triple Alliance is truly something to envy and awe. Though the vile copy created by Carrasco has been cast down, that does not mean that we should stop trying to return to these former glories. We shall rebuild the once-great empire of the Mexica, incorporating ideas from the Olmecs and the Toltecs, as well as from our own Socialist influences in order to rebuild and surpass the glories, culture, and industrial and economic might lost all those centuries ago when the Conquistador first reached shore."

MEX_red_aztecs_desc:0 "Casting down the false Tlatoani Carrasco and building a new paradise in his place, Frida Kahlo and the Triple Alliance Elite have created a Socialist paradise here in Mexico. By embracing the culture and religion of the original Aztec, Toltec, Olmec, and other Mexica peoples, the identity of the Nahua has been revived and the people rejoice under an egalitarian dictatorship of the Proletariat. Socialist democracy reigns under the Great Tōltēcātl Frida Kahlo, and peace and prosperity have finally won out over all other dark forces. Now, let us continue on this journey as we try to build a new Aztlān - one free of vice and pain, and one supported by the egalitarian and indigenous culture of our rebirthed people."

Not seen since the time of Maximilian I de Iturbide in 1867, it is finally time for us to return to our God guided monarchist path. However, this new monarchy shall be different from those of the past, guided by new ideologies and deepened experiences. Now all that is left to decide is which of our two constituent parties shall rise as the heralds of the restored Crown."

Though neither Urquiza’s vision or the Synarchist dream originally had any monarchist aspirations, by cooperating with the Integralists and by implementing our own ideas, we shall tailor-make a monarchist system to form-fit our new Mexico and its realities."

Though most do not conform to our views, there still are many radicals within their ranks that do. We shall take these radicals into the Unión Nacional Sinarquista as our newest formal members, allowing them to form paramilitaries and other blocs of influence to further our cause. With these brave patriots crossing the aisle, we hope that many of their comrades and fellow soldiers will take their example to mind and follow them into our arms."

MEX_ITG_our_own_democracy_desc:0 "In order to quiet the masses and give our loyal subjects some modicum of say in the government, no matter how small or ineffectual, we shall create our own shackled democracy under the Crown. Not a full one-party system in theory, in practice the Unión Nacional Sinarquista shall dominate, loosely tied to our allies in the Partido Integralista Nacional as part of the dominant ‘Alianza Antisocialista.’ Below us, various pre-vetted Right-wing parties will be allowed to organize and ‘run’ in our elections, such as the PARM or PRUN, but they shall never hold a real chance at ever seizing any amount of power from Urquiza’s Synarchists."
MEX_ITG_the_true_hero:0 "The True Hero!"
MEX_ITG_the_true_hero_desc:0 "Our first sovereign monarch, the honorable Agustín de Iturbide, was the greatest national father, independence figure, and leader our nation has ever had. However, despite this history, his name has been besmirched and his legacy has been dragged through the mud; his contributions to our Mexico overshadowed by the efforts of past figures like Hidalgo and Morelos and other Secular or Liberal fools. We must elevate this true son and hero of Mexico to the righteous and lofty height he deserves! Agustín I is the greatest Mexican to ever live, and our new monarch and Urquiza shall do everything in their power to live up to his wise and noble image."
MEX_ITG_maintain_labor_laws:0 "Maintain Revolutionary Labor Laws"
MEX_ITG_maintain_labor_laws_desc:0 "Though the Mexican Revolution was a massive step backwards for Mexican society, it also brought with it some small amount of wise legislation and practical changes. Particularly, the Revolutionary labor laws and worker protections were sound initiatives, though some may have gone too far or been too overzealous in their adherence to theoretical Socialism. We shall trim the caustic laws from this legal codex, but keep the real meat of their intention and goals, creating a syncretic mix of Synarchist and Socialist economic protections that should benefit all true Mexican patriots without proliferating laziness or other bad habits brought on by Leftist thought."
MEX_ITG_a_mixed_economy:0 "Mixed National Syndicalist Economics"
MEX_ITG_a_mixed_economy_desc:0 "In a fusion of Left and Right Syndicalism, we shall bring a truly mixed economy here to Mexico, for the good of all Mexicans. Through utilizing a reformed Ejido system and agricultural cooperatives along with privately owned estates and corporate units lording over other ranches, our agricultural industry shall blossom like never before. Through the introduction of some Corporatist, some Socialist, and even some minor Capitalist reforms, all blanketed with the visage of and purified of their taint by our noble Synarchism, and by only utilizing the good, and excising the bad from these diverse policies and schools of thought, we shall reach true prosperity."

MEX_ITG_recovered_from_the_depression_desc:0 "The Americans and their terrible economic practices fueled only by greed and pursuit of personal profit morally and financially bankrupt their nation, teaching them a harsh lesson they needed to learn but dragging the rest of the global economy down with them. The Great Depression hit Mexico like a truck, skyrocketing poverty and unemployment rates as our economy sank to rock bottom - a terrible situation only further worsened by our own Revolution. Since then, numerous regimes have worked to undo the damages, but have not succeeded until now! We have undone the damage done to our economy and have come out all the better for it. Now, as we dash into our new future, we shall bring about an economic miracle unlike the New World has ever seen!"

With a mixed economy built around National Syndicalist economics, we have brought untold profit and prosperity to our empire. Mexico’s first emperor and national father Agustín I de Iturbide has been elevated to the rightful position of heroism and respect that he truly deserves. Socialism and extremism have been eradicated from the state, and the Catholic Church has risen to support us without question due to our devout faith in the Lord. Our Synarchist Empire of Mexico has risen from the filth, cut away the damaging impurities, and kept all that makes Mexico truly strong and unique. Under Urquiza and our restored monarch, ‘El Imperio Mexicano’ shall reign in perpetuity!"

MEX_ITG_monarchist_catholicism_desc:0 "In order to build up the monarchy to be a pure, pious, and just institution, we shall incorporate Catholic social teachings and Church doctrine as part of the framework of the restored Crown. Fighting against unjust oppression, and for human dignity, Catholic morals, social justice, wealth redistribution through charity and other non-Socialist methods, and much more, these humanizing policies will help prop up the monarchy as the true and divine manifestation of the people’s will it is meant to be without letting corruption, selfish ambition, and sin from getting in the way."
MEX_ITG_complete_cooperation:0 "Complete Cooperation with the Church"
MEX_ITG_complete_cooperation_desc:0 "The Catholic Church is our greatest ally, and we should work to formalize and advance our cooperation, integrating their influence and power directly into the monarchy. Clergymen shall become trusted advisers and servants of the state while the Catholic Church of Mexico is directly integrated into our administration as an equal arm of the state loyal only to the Pope and the Crown.

MEX_ITG_distributism:0 "Catholic Distributism"
MEX_ITG_distributism_desc:0 "In line with Integralist doctrine, Christian Distributism along the lines of Catholic social teaching shall form the basis of our new economic system. Cooperatives and member-owned mutual organizations shall come together with small businesses and Mexican corporations in order to cooperate and together build a new prosperous and pious financial, consumer, and industrial system for Mexico. Though some of our enemies have decried this move as inching dangerously towards Christian Socialism, we have assuaged their fears, for our Catholic Distributism is wholly anti-Socialist; instead, it is merely populist out of dedication to God and inline with the teachings of Christ on charity and other economic aspects over any ideologue or temporal thinker."
MEX_ITG_corporatist_economy:0 "An Organic Corporatist Economy"
MEX_ITG_corporatist_economy_desc:0 "Taking our dive into Integralist economics even further, we shall create a nation-wide system of Organic Corporatism. In this system, each and every corporate organizational unit and other collective organization - be it our guilds, our Christian unions, our corporations, our collectives, or any other sector of the economy - shall function as an autonomous ‘organ’ within the state. In this decentralized structure, each organ will be free to administer their set trade and workspace or estate as they see fit, either collectively or by decree of the manager in charge in line with the wishes of his workers, depending on the specific unit. All they must do in return is adhere to the guidelines set by the central government and pay their predetermined tithe or tax to the state in whatever form the Crown asks for. With all of our corporate units functioning as a healthy system of organs, those that fail can be easily dealt with and corrected without disturbing the rest of the system, and cooperation between classes shall be fostered instead of conflict between them, only bolstering our profits."

They shall be elevated to become the new landed and titled aristocracy of Mexico, and with these new aristocrats at our side supporting the Partido Integralista Nacional and the Crown, there is nothing our new monarchy cannot achieve, and there will no longer be reason for the established dynasties of the world to continue looking down their nose upon us!"

With the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City being repaired and renovated to undo the damages of the Revolution, the Crown and the Partido Integralista Nacional shall raise Her high above our heads and back into our hearts once again as the shining beacon of piety and Godliness for all of Mexico to bask in."

With decentralized Organic Corporatism dominating the economy, with the Catholic Church more closely integrated into our regime than ever before, and with vile ills such as Democracy, Socialism, and Atheism utterly annihilated, Mexico has never been more prosperous or pure. With the new Mexican nobility at their side and with the Crown restored above them, the Partido Integralista Nacional of Vasconcelo and Abascal shall be the heralds of our new destiny as our restored Organic Empire strides into our God-guided destiny."

Although Urquiza may lack experience, he more than makes up for it with his cunning intellect and his fiery ambition to save Mexico and restore it to a place of glory at all costs.

The Ejidos will be transformed into corporate units as opposed to Socialist ones, and by pulling from the ideas of Charles Maurras, the Cercle Proudhon, the ANI, and the Falange, among many others, Urquiza and his Synarchists will build a unique economic system that puts Mexicans and Mexico first above all others, all without the need to stoop to Socialism and its ills."

With foolish notions like Democracy and Liberalism well and truly dead, this ‘republic’ finds its stability from the noble Catholic Church and from a fervent and loyal Mexican nationalism that Archduke Vasconcelos has advocated for and spread since taking office. Standing as a true embodiment of the idea of Accidentalismo - or the position that considers the state form of a nation irrelevant - Vasconcelos shall build Mexico with or without is promised monarch, at least for now, for it would seem the Archduke has great plans for Mexico regardless of who or even if someone sits on the throne."

Stating that he will announce to all when he feels Mexico is truly ready, Archduke Vasconcelos shall remain as the de-facto leader of Mexico until then, guiding this ‘republic’ towards its eventual royal destiny.

That inherently corrupt and exploitative system has been erased, replaced by rational centralized governance and the guidance of our faith in God. Now free of Socialism, Liberalism, and Democracy, Mexico’s new age can finally begin anew without obstacles or rancid influence gnawing away at our foundations and at our traditions.

Though first forced into this republican position, our Archduke has come to take his role in stride, slowly preparing the Mexican nation and its people for the eventual arrival of their promised monarch. Though Archduke Vasconcelos still promises this day will still one-day come, he still assures the nation that this day is not today. Mexico is still a wild and unpredictable land still in need of breaking and taming - a job that is far below the divine nature of our future monarch. Instead, it is up to the Archduke to handle this messy task, getting his hands dirty so the future heirs to the throne do not have to.

With allies in the Church and among Mexico’s captains of industry, Garza shall bring prosperity and order to Mexico, and this new era - this ‘Garziato’ - shall endure as another great age to rival or even surpass the awe-inspiring glory of the Porfiriato."

MEX_laissezfaire_economy_desc:0 "With the foundations of our new republic laid and with the PRUN firmly in control of the nation’s destiny, the time has to enact their planned economic reformation program. Calling for a Corporatist system to serve as the framework of our new economic system, big businesses and corporate units made up of agricultural, laborer, martial, and scientific groups shall come to dominate Mexico’s financial system. With their organized expertise and sheer-size now behind our economic destiny, Mexico shall surely rise to a new prosperous age of profit and progress."
MEX_red_scare:0 "El Temor Rojo"
MEX_red_scare_desc:0 "The Socialists that stalk our nation want nothing more than to destroy us and the noble republic we have built! We need to make sure all true Mexicans know that these vile Reds are no allies or friends, but instead they are wolves in sheep’s clothing waiting for their moment to pounce. In order to win over the masses and show them the truth, a statewide campaign of terror against Socialism in all its forms shall be organized in order to scare our populace into fearing the Red Devil and learning the truth. With the people properly educated on Socialism’s vile influence and on our side, we shall work towards the total eradication of Leftist thought in Mexico."
MEX_destroy_synarchists:0 "Eradicate Radical Nationalism"
MEX_destroy_synarchists_desc:0 "Perverted forms of noble Nationalism, such as Integralism, Synarchism, and the filth spewed by the AAS, are putrid and sickening ideologies far too closely attached to vaguely-Lefitst economic principles, anticlericalist attitudes, and/or radical ideas that corrupt the Catholic faith. However, they are also dying ideologies that have slowly lost the vast majority of their support bases. These sick and dying schools of thought just need the last nail to be hammered into their coffins in order to make sure these deluded extremists are never a threat to this country, and never sully our pure form of patriotic nationalism, ever again."
MEX_destroy_reds:0 "Rout the Reds"
MEX_destroy_reds_desc:0 "Now that the republic is mostly secure, nearly free of radicalism and its dangerous temptations, it is finally time to deal a final blow to the radical Left. Though these forces proliferated and flourished following the Mexican Revolution, they have grown decadent, corrupt, and traitorous. With the last of their numbers still alive either rotting in jail or hiding out in sun-blasted caves, we shall scour the nation completely of these miscreants. All radical Leftists now already allowed within our democracy shall be brought before a jury or the sword. Mexico is of God, not of Marx!"
MEX_support_the_church:0 "Deepen Ties to the Church"
MEX_support_the_church_desc:0 "Now that the Socialists have been ousted and true democracy reigns, we need to help the Church to rebuild itself after the repression they were victim to under the Socialist administration. By aiding this holy Catholic institution, we will not only gain the support of devout Catholics across the nation, but also place a great debt upon the Church that they will have to repay. Above all however, it is our duty as the truly faithful to repair and rebuild God’s own Earthly tether and aid His clergy and flock."
MEX_catholic_identity:0 "A Pious Catholic Identity"
MEX_catholic_identity_desc:0 "For centuries, Catholicism has been an integral part of Mexican culture and identity. Long before our independence from Spain, we were a devout Catholic nation, and this pious heritage was only recently robbed from us during the Mexican Revolution. Roman Catholicism shall be enshrined as the official faith of the state, and the atheist policies of the former regime shall be completely torn down and reversed. Mexican culture is Catholic by nature, and that is what it always shall be!"
MEX_protectionist_economy:0 "Economic Protectionism"
MEX_protectionist_economy_desc:0 "Though our economic activities on the world stage are important, our resources and the profitability of our own domestic markets are even more so. We need to protect our economy from foreign interests and vultures by becoming independent and self-sufficient like the thunderous economies of the USA, Germany, or the combined powers of the Entente. Only through protectionist practices that benefit our own above the foreign, such as strong tariffs and import quotas, can true prosperity be attained."
MEX_privatization:0 "Mass Privatization"
MEX_privatization_desc:0 "Now that fair and free democracy has been ushered in and the old Socialist regime has been uprooted, we can finally begin to undo their nationalization efforts by selling off business, industry, and other slices of our economic infrastructure to the people. Finally, those with sound business sense, and the resources and know-how to efficiently utilize these economic sectors, will be allowed to prove it, granted they can afford the upfront cost. Privatized capitalism shall once again be ushered into Mexico!"
MEX_end_the_ejido_system:0 "End the Ejido System"
MEX_end_the_ejido_system_desc:0 "The Ejido system - a system of communal agricultural cooperatives created in the wake of the Mexican Revolution and massively expanded under the Zapata presidency - is a very flawed system. It would be far more practical to re-privatize the agricultural sector and allow farmers and businesses to work their own parcels of farmland as before. We shall uproot this final legacy of the Revolutionary government and free Mexico’s farming system from the vices of Socialism."
MEX_new_ranches:0 "New Ranches for a New Mexico"
MEX_new_ranches_desc:0 "A vast majority of the old ranchero class have come to our government with an enticing proposal. They have offered to voluntarily give up the Ejido system - for it was never too popular with the farmer majority anyway - and have offered voting support to our party as a solid bloc, if our administration were to fund a series of new, modernized ranches to be built across the nation. The hope is that this move will mobilize our agricultural sector en masse by placating our farmer class while giving them the tools to efficiently feed the nation and build more profitable, larger producing farms and ranches."
MEX_neoliberalism:0 "Classical Liberalism"
MEX_neoliberalism_desc:0 "The new Liberal era in Mexico can finally begin with our election, and it is our duty to bring about this new golden age for our people. Under the PLC, free market Capitalism, open civil liberties, economic freedom, and cultural liberalism shall finally be peacefully ushered into our Republic. With the ideas of John Locke, David Ricardo, and José María Luis Mora now forming the basis of our new administration, the people of Mexico shall finally know true freedom, liberty, profitability, and prosperity!"
MEX_media_support:0 "Charm the Media Apparatus"
MEX_media_support_desc:0 "The (mostly) Liberal-minded media certainly played their role in our election, and with our long-standing cooperative relationship being what it is, we should move to ‘officially’ tie ourselves to this powerful tool of public manipulation. With underhanded deals and backroom talks, we shall wed the Mexican media apparatus to our administration, effectively creating our own ‘Liberal’ propaganda machine on the back of graft, political favors, and bribery. With the media under our sway, the PLC shall become the darling of the public’s eye while our new allies demonize our rivals and expose our enemies with the blinding light of journalism. Though they won’t always be reporting the whole truth, it is for the best to maintain stability - and our rule."
MEX_free_market_economy:0 "The Freer the Market..."
MEX_free_market_economy_desc:0 "...the freer the people! Only through a free, unfettered market can our economy be truly fair and thrive. Without governmental intervention or unnecessary amounts of red-tape or oversight, our financial system and industrial sectors will be able to flourish and pump out profit and goods like never before. Only through a truly free market can all of Mexico and its people follow suit."
MEX_invest_in_the_industry:0 "Expand Commercial Industries"
MEX_invest_in_the_industry_desc:0 "We need to invest in our civilian industry in order to jumpstart our faltering economy, for the Revolution and the government that followed did nothing but wreak havoc on our once-profitable system. Though this will be far from complete handouts, it will provide the step-up our commercial business and industries need in order to function once more and start turning a profit."
MEX_invest_in_heavy_industry:0 "Domestic Heavy Industry Plans"
MEX_invest_in_heavy_industry_desc:0 "The military is as important to the nation as it is expensive to maintain. However, it must be done lest our armed forces fall even further behind the times. In order to ensure our martial prowess and readiness for war, military industry shall be expanded across the nation and reformed to be more efficient. Only with a strong, modernized, and well-supplied military industrial complex can Mexican democracy truly be safe."
MEX_mexico_industrialized:0 "The Industrious Mexican Miracle"
MEX_mexico_industrialized_desc:0 "Though our reforms are far from over, they have already begun to pay dividends. All around the nation, the black smog of progress fills the air as more factories and refineries spark their furnaces for the first time. An economic miracle on a scale not seen since the Industrial Revolution has blossomed here in Mexico, and only through continuing this mass industrialization push can we truly continue to profit and progress into a profitable modernity."
MEX_progressive_thought:0 "Truly Progressive Thought"
MEX_progressive_thought_desc:0 "Progressivism is a relatively new idea to our republic - a fine medium between radical Leftist reforms and the slow, hollow promises of Liberalism. Regardless, progressive thought must be spread and expanded to form the basis of our society’s values. No longer can reactionary and conservative beliefs force our nation and our people into the muddy mire of the past. Only through progressivism can we truly progress into our destined future!"
MEX_civil_liberties:0 "Expand and Enshrine Civil Liberties"
MEX_civil_liberties_desc:0 "Protecting civil liberties is one of the most important duties of fair, progressive democracy. That is why our administration is to put our utmost effort in making sure civil liberties are respected and greatly expanded by enshrining them into law through legislation while protecting them at all costs through sharp governance and with an able, loyal police force. From freedom of speech to freedom of religion, all innate rights of man shall be upheld by the state without deviation."
MEX_interventionist_economy:0 "Promote Economic Interventionism"
MEX_interventionist_economy_desc:0 "The economy is like a river - every so often its natural course must be corrected and altered in order to promote optimal flow. We must enshrine this interventionist principle into the foundations of our administration, interfering in the economic process when it is called for in order to promote optimal levels of fairness and competition so that productivity and profitability remain as high as possible without trampling the masses under unnecessary greed."
MEX_secure_democracy:0 "Secure and Safeguard Pure Democracy"
MEX_secure_democracy_desc:0 "Now that elections have been held and democracy has truly risen, we need to make sure no coup or revolution ever endangers our infantile democracy ever again. Unbiased electoral watchdogs shall be created to ensure a fair and free democratic process, while our military and police institutions shall be cleansed of their political leanings so that they may rise to become true, unbiased, and apolitical arms of the republic. Democracy is a noble institution, and our new regime shall work to uphold it, no matter the outcome of any fair vote."
MEX_social_security:0 "The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social"
MEX_social_security_desc:0 "Every citizen of our republic needs to know that the state has their back when things get hard. We shall create a welfare apparatus that acts as a safety net supporting all true citizens of Mexico, based on similar systems in America and Europe. In order to organize and administer this new system, the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - or the Mexican Institute of Social Security - shall rise to take care of the people who need it most, as they need it."
MEX_universal_healthcare:0 "Universal Healthcare for All Mexicans"
MEX_universal_healthcare_desc:0 "Taking our new social security program one step further, we have moved to bring ‘free’ universal healthcare to all Mexican citizens. Healthcare, like the social security program, shall be paid through the taxes already levied against our people, and private companies will no longer be allowed to profit off the pain and misery of the masses. With this system in place, we can focus on steady and stable population growth free from fears of an ineffectual or overstretched private healthcare system dropping the ball on our citizens when they need it most."
MEX_social_democracy:0 "Deradicalized Social Democracy"
MEX_social_democracy_desc:0 "As we distance ourselves from the other, more radical Leftist parties, we must ensure that we do not compromise on our vision simply to appease our detractors. Mexico’s destiny is that of Social Democracy - a socially-responsible and welfare-supported capitalist economic system paired with a fair, free, and progressive Democratic form of governance. This fusion of Liberal and Leftist policies shall serve Mexico greatly - standing one foot in the future and one foot in the Revolutionary past. We shall undo the mistakes of the former Socialist government while upholding the few things they did right, all without falling prey to radicalism."
MEX_moderate_the_left:0 "Moderate the Left"
MEX_moderate_the_left_desc:0 "As more and more Socialists, Syndicalists, Anarchists, and other Leftist radicals jump ship from their failing parties and join in with our PLM, we need to publicly and loudly re-proclaim the moderate stances of our party. Though radicals may move into our ranks, the core vision of the PLM will never waver! We are firmly a party of Social Democracy and pro-Labor policies - a far cry from the radical Socialism of the Revolutionary government that preceded our republic and various parties that supported them. Radicalism and extremism have no place in our modern Mexico!"
MEX_moderate_socialist_economy:0 "The Pink Pearl of the Americas"
MEX_moderate_socialist_economy_desc:0 "Though we have implemented varying Socialist, Progressive, and Laborist policies, our nation is still Capitalist - at least in part. We have proven that a fusion of Capitalism and Socialism is not only possible, but profitable. With a mix of privatization and nationalization, our economy and our people have thrived like never before. Our Mexican Republic shines as a pink pearl of Social Capitalistic excess - a luminous beacon in a dark world."
MEX_meet_with_the_pna:0 "Cooperate with the PNA"
MEX_meet_with_the_pna_desc:0 "The PNA - the Partido Nacional Agrarista -  is the largest Socialist party of any kind in Mexico. Long have they dominated Leftist thought and the wider Leftist movement in the nation, but their big-tent approach means their vast body is open to being poached. We shall work with both party leaders above the table and disillusioned individual ministers under the table in order to draw as much of the PNA into our ranks. Given we are the reformist solution, many of their revolutionary-minded radicals find our vision irreconcilable, but we are sure we can win over the bulk of their party to our cause, in time."
MEX_meet_with_the_pmt:0 "Break Bread with the PPS"
MEX_meet_with_the_pmt_desc:0 "The PPS - the Partido Popular Socialista - is the largest Syndicalist party in the nation. Given their position playing second-fiddle to the PNA of Zapata for so long, they are eager to throw off his reputation and work with our government. We will reach out to these moderate Syndicalists and Laborists, incorporating some of their least radical ideas into our legislation while their members join our ranks."
MEX_meet_with_the_pnr:0 "Defang the PNR"
MEX_meet_with_the_pnr_desc:0 "The PNR - the Partido Nacional Revolucionario - may be the smallest of the three main Socialist parties in the nation, but they are also the most infamous, the most radical, and the most violent. In an effort to prevent these overzealous extremists from destroying our nation from within, we shall move to hold diplomatic talks between our ranks in order to placate their most violent urges. Though we may receive some heat from the other parties for talking with the PNR, hopefully it will be worth it if we can simply earn their begrudging support - even if just among their more moderate members."

MEX_second_election:0 "The Second Free Mexican Elections"
MEX_second_election_desc:0 "With our republic surviving the term of our first fairly elected executive, democracy has well and truly flourished in our new republican state. As the next elections come and go, a new administration shall rise to take the place of the old stewards of democracy, and all Mexicans shall bear witness to the noble democratic process. Though far from perfect, our republican system is the best hope for our nation and our people, so may it last in perpetuity for many terms to come!"
MEX_PRUN_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PRUN"
MEX_PRUN_second_term_desc:0 "With the ever-untrustworthy machinations of democracy playing out once again in yet another election cycle, our Partido Revolucionario de Unificación Nacional has once again come out on top. With our mandate secured democratically twice now, we are free to rule this republic as we see fit, with little opposition able to stand in our way. Under our assured rule, conservatism, militarism, and non-radical nationalist fervor shall flourish as our corporatist economy continues to turn a great profit for the nation."
MEX_Integrate_PARM:0 "Absorb the PARM"
MEX_Integrate_PARM_desc:0 "The Partido Auténtico de la Revolución Nacional is a militaristic nationalist party largely composed of veterans, soldiers, military staff, and other like-minded conservatives that has been barred from democratic elections within the nation in order to promote the supposed apolitical nature of the armed forces. However, their ranks may find a kindred soul in our PRUN, which holds dear many of the same beliefs and policies. We shall move to absorb the majority of the PARM to both bolster our support base and to guarantee our protection while further entrenching our party’s ties to the military apparatus."
MEX_Almazans_Populism:0 " Almazan's Populism"
MEX_Almazans_Populism_desc:0 "Juan Andreu Almazán is one of the most influential and respected names within the party, and though he may not lead us anymore, his politics still deeply influence our policy. His ideas on implementing expansive conservative populism to win over the masses has proven popular within the party, and with our democratic mandate enshrined, we are free to pursue his more radically populist economics in order to bring fair profit to all Mexicans. Sheltered and supported by the state and by the PRUN, our populace surely can’t fail!"
MEX_PAN_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PAN"
MEX_PAN_second_term_desc:0 "Secured now twice by democratic process, the mandate of our Partido Acción Nacional has been upheld despite our many foes. By choice of the people, our Catholic heritage and staunch anti-radicalism shall continue unopposed while our protectionist approach to economics proceeds with wavering. Through privatized capitalism and agricultural reform, we have once again won over the masses, and now we shall make good on our electoral promises. Mexico’s stance as a proud Conservative, Capitalist, and Catholic nation shall continue under the guidance of the PAN!"
MEX_Integrate_Catholic_Youth:0 "Integrate Catholic Youth"
MEX_Integrate_Catholic_Youth_desc:0 "Across the nation, there exists numerous Catholic and Christian youth groups, student associations, and other organizations eager to aid the PAN and our regime. We shall incorporate these pious youths into the official PAN hierarchy as the new youth wing of the party. Here at our side, they shall help soften our public image while providing an easy breeding ground to proliferate our ideas, ensuring a reliable voter base and platform to reach the national youth for generations to come."
MEX_Christian_Democracy:0 "Pure and Pious Christian Democracy"
MEX_Christian_Democracy_desc:0 "Incorporating ideas of Social Catholic Teachings, traditional Christian values, and other pious philosophies into both our legislation and the very structure of the party and nation shall ensure that our democracy does not stray from God’s chosen path for the Mexican people. This syncretic system of conservative Catholic stances on moral, social, and cultural issues that takes a more socially-informed stance on economic and labor issues is surely what our people need to survive and thrive in this blessed, pure republic, and with our mandate secured, there is no one to stop us."
MEX_PLC_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PLC"
MEX_PLC_second_term_desc:0 "Standing as the bastion of Liberalism in Mexico and once again defending our democratic mandate, the Partido Liberal Constitucionalista has been chosen yet again by the masses to lead our democracy. Professing classical liberalism, unrestricted capitalism, and immense agricultural and industrial reforms, this economics-focused party has won over the masses with its delivered promises of profit and prosperity. With their second term now confirmed, Mexico shall truly be ushered into its new Liberal age."
MEX_Embrace_Maderos_Image:0 "Embrace Madero's Image"
MEX_Embrace_Maderos_Image_desc:0 "Perhaps the most famous and greatest Liberal of our age, the late former-President Francisco Ignacio Madero González is a hero to Mexican democracy and liberalism. A champion of civil liberties, capitalist reform, and social justice, Madero embodied everything the modern PLC professes. We shall glue ourselves to his noble, beloved image and raise Madero as the national hero he should be recognized as by all. Following his plans for the nation and by masking ourselves behind his legacy, we shall enshrine our position as the heralds of Mexico’s proud Liberal renaissance."
MEX_Rebrand_Liberalism:0 "Rebrand Mexican Liberalism"
MEX_Rebrand_Liberalism_desc:0 "Liberalism has been slandered and defaced by Mexican regimes for decades, sullying our image and our platform. We must repair the image of Liberalism in the eyes of the masses, and the only way to do so is with popular reforms and profit-making policies. Only by making good on our promises to bring modernity and prosperity to the Mexican people can we truly rebrand our image."
MEX_PCP_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PCP"
MEX_PCP_second_term_desc:0 "Supported by popular mandate, the Partido Constitucional Progresista has yet again secured the right to rule our republic. As champions of progressivism and industrialization, the PCP shall continue their push to create a true, fair, and Liberal Mexican interventionist welfare state without falling prey to the radicalism that has come to infect the PLM, and without the self-serving hunger for profit of the PLC. As the defenders of the common man, the PCP shall utilize their hard-won popularity to continue to transform Mexico into a profitable, fair, and safeguarded Capitalist republic."
MEX_The_Revolution_Fulfilled:0 "The Revolution Fulfilled"
MEX_The_Revolution_Fulfilled_desc:0 "Though the Mexican Revolution eventually was a failure, with Zapata’s regime being overthrown violently, the ideals of this honorable conflict have not died out. Instead, they have found a home here in the PCP. Though we are not nearly as radical as Zapata, our party aligns well with the views of the initial victors of the conflict under Álvaro Obregón. Though Obregón’s PLM radicalized in his absence, our PCP has stayed true to these less-extreme ideas. We shall be the heralds of this Progressive agenda, and under our rule, the Revolution shall finally be proven successful."
MEX_The_Peoples_Liberalism:0 " The People's Liberalism"
MEX_The_Peoples_Liberalism_desc:0 "Our PCP has transformed what it means to be Liberal. We have modified Liberalism to fit our needs and, far more importantly, the needs of our people. This populist form of Liberalism has come to dominate Mexican politics as a palatable, less extreme middleground between Socialist and mainline Liberal politics, for both have become to be viewed as predatory and opportunistic. With civil liberties enshrined, a welfare state established, and a new modernized culture sweeping the nation, we have utilized this ‘People’s Liberalism’ to transform our republic, and to metamorphose the Mexican masses into a prosperous and modern people like never seen before."
MEX_PLM_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PLM"
MEX_PLM_second_term_desc:0 "After stealing support from the radical Left while winning over the Mexican masses with popular reforms, the Partido Laborista Mexicano has seemingly proven that moderate Socialism and Laborist policy truly is the way to bring Leftist politics into Mexico without obstacles. By denying the revolutionary tendencies of the wider Left and by strictly adhering to their syncretic Social Democratic principles, the PLM has come to secure yet another term through fair republican elections. With the masses at their backs and the wider Left throwing in their support, the PLM has become a dominant bloc, ensuring their victory for many terms to come."
MEX_Integrate_the_Red_Militias:0 "Integrate the Red Militias"
MEX_Integrate_the_Red_Militias_desc:0 "Throughout the countryside and across the hinterlands, Socialist militias still organize and convene to act against our republic - both peacefully and violently depending on the group. In order to bolster the dominance of the PLM while providing another additional arm of security to the republic, we shall move to integrate these militias into our regime as the official militant arm of the party. This shall allow us to by-pass the restrictions calling for an apolitical armed forces, while giving our party a loyal defense force - a necessary act in many of our ministers’ eyes given the reactionary tendencies and conservative sympathies of our armed forces."
MEX_Mexican_Laborism:0 "Mexican Laborism"
MEX_Mexican_Laborism_desc:0 "True democratic Laborism has been introduced to our republic. This small taste of Socialist policy has proven to be very popular among the masses, granting our industrial, agricultural, and unskilled labor force the protections, incentives, and rights they need to thrive and survive in our modern republic. Never shall the simple laborers - the backbone of our very nation - be trampled underfoot by their government ever again. Pro-labor and moderate Socialist policies are the way of Mexico’s future, and the people of our republic best prepare for the peaceful advent of this semi-Socialist system, for it is the only future Mexico needs."
MEX_ban_socialist_parties:0 "Ban Socialist Parties"
MEX_ban_socialist_parties_desc:0 "As yet another republican term draws closer to its end, our regime has seen fit to preemptively act against the resurgent Socialist menace and their allies among the Mexican Left. In order to ensure the sanctity and safety of our democracy, all far-left parties, from radical groups like the PPS, PMT, and PNR, to more moderate groups like the PLM and PNA, shall be barred from all future national and local elections. Only with these vile Reds blocked from participating in our democracy can Mexico truly be free and safe."
MEX_no_bans:0 "Preserve Multi-Party Pluralist Politics"
MEX_no_bans_desc:0 "Despite our preconceived biases and political leanings, we cannot jeopardize fair and free democracy simply by banning our detractors and rivals from running against us. We must prove on the political stage that we are the right choice for Mexico, and it shall be up to the people to see through the lies and siren songs of the radical Left and Right to our professed truths. Only with true competition and ample choice can fair and free pluralist democracy truly thrive."
MEX_ban_authoritarian_parties:0 "Ban Reactionary Parties"
MEX_ban_authoritarian_parties_desc:0 "As the wheels of democracy continue to turn, we must take precaution over the rising strength and influence of the reactionary Right. These authoritarians and nationalist extremists have no place in our modern Mexican republic. To preserve and safeguard our democracy, far-right parties such as PRUN and PARM, or the various groups within the AAS, shall be banned from running in future elections both on national and local level. Only then can the Mexican people finally be free of reactionary taint."
MEX_real_democracy:0 "Unfettered Mexican Democracy"
MEX_real_democracy_desc:0 "With the finalized framework of our republic coalescing as yet another democratic term runs its course, we have taken the necessary measures needed to ensure that a fair, free, and untampered republican process can flourish in our Mexico. Despite a history of violent coups and revolutions, our reforged democracy is hopefully here to stay. With the people’s voices finally being heard without meddling from outside sources or from paranoid, power-hungry parties, unfettered democracy has finally been ushered into our once-wild nation. Now, we look to the shining future as our democracy marches forwards in perpetuity, finally purified of corruption and self-serving ambitions, for for the first time in our history, the people of Mexico finally have all the say."
MEX_dominant_party_democracy:0 "A Dominant-Party Democracy"
MEX_dominant_party_democracy_desc:0 "As we formalize the structure of our country for generations to come, we have taken precautions necessary to ensure the nation and its institutions care for the masses however necessary - even when the masses themselves do not know what is best for them. As elections are continuously held, one party - our party - shall come to dominate the electoral system, whether through legitimate means or underhanded tactics. Despite this ‘betrayal’ of the supposedly fair democratic process, we shall ensure that the people’s voices are well and truly heard - we just will only listen to those voices that make sense or agree with our positions - for that is our duty as the stewards of this noble, ‘fair’ land."

Calles firmly believes that the way forward for Mexico is for him to seize total power over the nation, ushering in a set of reforms that will transform Mexico into a true revolutionary state, which he has dubbed 'The Maximato.' Under this Totalist state and Calles’ PNR, Mexico shall be guided into its new destiny as we shed our past and embrace our new Red future!"
MEX_new_economic_policy:0 "Nueva Política Económica"
MEX_new_economic_policy_desc:0 "Mexico's economic policies have changed very little in the last decade. We shall not stand for it any longer! Calles has decided to take our economy towards a new revolutionary height with his ‘New Economic Policy.’ This new system will bring a nationalized Socialist planned economy to Mexico supported by small amounts of Capitalism and private ownership in order to jumpstart our fledgling financial system."
MEX_peoples_factories:0 "People's Factories"
MEX_peoples_factories_desc:0 "We've had a mixed economy in our country since the Revolution, allowing private ownership of factories but enforcing several regulations and workers’ rights on the industrialists. However, Calles sees this as a corruption of our revolution, and has ordered us to begin a collectivisation process of the industry - save for the most vital industries which are to be nationalized, in order to truly allow the people to own the fruits of their labour and for peak efficiency and fairness to reign in our economy."
MEX_peoples_mines:0 "People's Mines"
MEX_peoples_mines_desc:0 "Like it happened with our industry, our mines were also mostly in the hands of private investors. These foreign capitalists shall profit from the exploitation of our workers no further, as we shall collectivise the mining operations across Mexico. The Proletariat of the Maximato shall own the means of production and the treasures of the earth beneath them."
MEX_control_ejidos:0 "Control the Ejidos"
MEX_control_ejidos_desc:0 "The Ejidos are by definition already a collectivised system of agricultural management, and we're very pleased with that. However, these Ejidos work independently, with goals that tend to differ from the good of all Mexicans. We shall bring all Ejidos of Mexico under our centralized control in order to coordinate their activities with the greater good of Mexico in mind."
MEX_by_crom:0 "Support CROM"
MEX_by_crom_desc:0 "The 'Confederacion Regional Obrera Mexicana' has been for a long time an ally of Calles.

Since the CGT stood with our enemies, we only stand to gain from this."

MEX_enforce_article_27_desc:0 "Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution states that the property and the waters included within the national borders are property of the Nation and, as such, the Nation has the right of imposing dictates to private owners in order to defend Public Interests.

MEX_calles_laws_desc:0 "Officially, the 'Ley Calles' - or Calles Laws - will now be in effect with the goal of controlling and limiting Catholic worship in Mexico, as well as limiting the influence of the Catholic Church. These laws shall reduce the number of priests to one for each six thousand inhabitants, add the need for a state licence in order to serve as priest, and add the need to register at a local office where the preaching will take place. These heavy restrictions shall stange Catholicism and its vile, corrosive influences, slowly freeing Mexico from the grasp of this Opiate of the Masses."
MEX_socialist_education:0 "A Purely Socialist Education"
MEX_socialist_education_desc:0 "Mexico still has the old school system from before the revolution with only a few slight tweaks and reforms being pursued. This is not what Calles has envisioned for Mexico, and as such, he has ordered the nation to begin a major re-restructuring of our education system.

We shall revoke civil liberties from the clergy, including the right of trial by jury, outlaw certain religious orders that do not align with our views, and deprive them of property rights with the goal of creating a true atheist state.

This was an advantage in order to manage meager coalitions and pesky compromises within the sickly revolutionary democracy. However, Calles is a reformist and needs all the authority he can get in order to achieve his mighty ambitions for the Maximato. To that end, he has proposed a reform that allows the President to have untold amounts of executive power, effectively making Calles the most powerful man in the nation with no equal and little checks and balances on his grasp. Mexico shall be one with Calles, and Calles shall embody the new Mexico."
MEX_loyal_military:0 "A Loyal and Fanatical Military"
MEX_loyal_military_desc:0 "The reason for our success during the revolution was the disloyalty of military elements that switched sides to our cause. While back then that became very useful for our cause, nowadays we consider it a possible threat to our stability. With this in mind, we shall reward loyalty to our government in the military and punish dissenting officers, with demotions if necessary and with harsher tactics if our hand is so forced. With new training and ideological indoctrination measures, we shall transform the Mexican armed forces into a feverishly loyal and terrifyingly effective arm of the Maximato while ensuring their total dedication to Calles."
MEX_direccion_federal_de_seguridad:0 "Dirección Federal de Seguridad"
MEX_direccion_federal_de_seguridad_desc:0 "While we now enjoy the newfound loyalty of our armed forces, we need to create something to keep the civilian population and the military in check as well, just in case they change their minds and decide to overthrow us. To that end, we shall create a paramilitary force, the 'Dirección Federal de Seguridad,' which shall be under the direct command of our President. This paramilitary shall only answer to Calles, serving as his personal bodyguard, death squads, and secret service. Under their watch, even our army shall be kept in check as Calles builds a new Mexico atop a foundation of fear, strength, and intimidation."
MEX_lead_the_pnr:0 "Centralize the Apparatus of State"
MEX_lead_the_pnr_desc:0 "The 'Partido Nacional Revolucionario' is the party which currently supports Calles. However, Calles doesn't lead the PNR, and that has led to some heated arguments between him and other influential figures within the party. To solve this, we shall make Calles leader of the party, for after all, he is already the Head of State. There's no reason why he shouldn't be the head of the party that rules with him, and there is little stopping him if the PNR were foolish enough to refuse. With Calles at the helm of the party, he shall be free from any obstacle as he moves to centralize the state and greatly weaken federalism and the positions of his frequent rivals - the state governors - in order to consolidate power within the hands of the President."
MEX_political_commisars:0 "Political Commissars"
MEX_political_commisars_desc:0 "Now that our takeover is complete, we need to secure the loyalty of the army. Even if troops and officers assure us of their loyalty, we need a vanguard body to keep them in check in case they change their minds if and when we let our guard down. These commissars shall serve as a bridge between the party and the army, ensuring utmost loyalty and dedication to the Maximato within our ranks, on penalty of punishment or death."
MEX_control_congress:0 "Control Congress"
MEX_control_congress_desc:0 "The Congress in our country was meant to secure representation for our citizens. However, factionalism and petty squabbles have hindered reforms and led to an incapable, ineffectual, and near totally useless congress. Calles and the PNR shall take complete control of the congress, in order to help them 'solve' their differences and be able to pass our reforms without any further problems. Congress shall just become another tool of Calles, adding to his legitimate facade and enabling his rise to total power even more."
MEX_cult_of_personality:0 "The Personality Cult of El Jefe Máximo"
MEX_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Plutarco Calles - or El Jefe Máximo as he likes to be called - has managed to consolidate his position and the position of his PNR, rising to become the undisputed leader of Mexico. His role in reforming Mexico into a new Totalist paradise cannot be debated either, for never has Mexico been so united, safe, and prosperous under such a capable strongman. We shall reward his wisdom and commitment to the greater Mexican good by instating a massive propaganda campaign to uphold his image. Calles’ face shall become the face of Mexico itself as our people and the state uplift El Jefe Máximo as the demigod of the Revolution he truly is."
MEX_purge_reactionary_thought:0 "Purge Reactionary Thought"
MEX_purge_reactionary_thought_desc:0 "Our country has had its progress delayed due to the traditionalist and reactionary culture of its people. Now that we have succeeded in transforming Mexico into a more modern and collectivist society, we now should focus on shaping the culture of future generations, so that these reactionary thoughts don't disrupt future progress. A new Mexican identity and culture shall be born - one free of the taint of Catholicism, conservatism, liberalism, reactionary nationalism, and other deluded false ideas - that supports and uplifts the ideas held dearly to El Jefe Máximo and his Maximato."
MEX_perfect_dictatorship:0 "La Dictadura Perfecta"
MEX_perfect_dictatorship_desc:0 "Calles has achieved what once seemed impossible: A dictatorship that is not only tolerated by the people, but even beloved by the common man. El Jefe Máximo is slowly but surely turning into a national figure that will inevitably be written down in the history books as a revolutionary reformist and true hero to Mexico. As the national father of our rebirthed nation, Plutarco Calles has created the perfect dictatorship, and shall now guide this stable ship into the unknown but bountiful waters of our new destiny!"

MEX_death_of_calles:0 "The Death of El Jefe"
MEX_death_of_calles_desc:0 "After a decade of heartbreak over the loss of his beloved Natalia and after the rigors of statecraft ground down his health and will, the beloved Plutarco Calles - our El Jefe Máximo - has finally given up the ghost. In the wake of his passing, a power vacuum has been cut open within the Maximato and the PNR, with Lázaro Cárdenas, Emilio Portes Gil, and Manuel Perez Treviño all jockeying for power and control over the party and the state. Only one can rise to take the place of El Jefe, and now all of Mexico waits for the day their new strongman will rise above the others to lead our nation into its new destiny."
MEX_President_Cardenas:0 "President Cárdenas"
MEX_President_Cardenas_desc:0 "Outmaneuvering the revisionist Gil and the fanatical Treviño, Lázaro Cárdenas now stands where Calles once stood, but it is not a position he intends to maintain. A divisive figure, Cárdenas both lauds Calles as a hero for saving the ideas of the Mexican Revolution from reactionary forces, but also frames him as a tragic villain that was consumed by his lust for power and his desire to save his nation, losing sight of what truly mattered - the wellbeing and will of the Mexican people. To right the wrongs of the past, Cárdenas has begun to dismantle the Maximato from within in order to return noble and free democracy to our people."
MEX_Dissolve_Congress:0 "Dissolve Calles’ Corrupt Congress"
MEX_Dissolve_Congress_desc:0 "Standing as President of the Maximato and with power consolidated within his own hands, Lázaro Cárdenas has begun the process of dismantling the Maximato from his seat of near-absolute power. Moving to dissolve the PNR-dominated congress in order to allow free elections, Cárdenas has announced his own candidacy in the revitalized Partido Laborista Mexicano for the coming elections, and now, thanks to our new President, Mexico once again marches towards fair, pure democracy."
MEX_President_Gil:0 "President Gil"
MEX_President_Gil_desc:0 "Rising past the naive Cárdenas and the loyalist Treviño, Emilio Portes Gil has taken Calles’ position as leader of the state. Despite his close relationship with Calles and his position within the upper echelon of PNR party leadership, Gil is a noted ‘revisionist,’ seen as a humanizing force within the Calles regime while still being devoted to the party line. As President of the Maximato, Gil is expected to uphold the image of Calles as a just and noble national father, wiping his darker deeds under the rug as he expands the power of the legislature and raises the whole PNR as the collective leadership of Mexico."
MEX_An_idealized_Calles:0 "An Idealized Calles"
MEX_An_idealized_Calles_desc:0 "Despite his extreme measures and proclivity to utilize force to get his way, Plutarco Calles - our beloved El Jefe - was a true Mexican patriot! By order of President Gil, the record of Calles’ more unscrupulous or less popular decisions and acts shall be wiped from the record so that future generations only know Calles as the perfect strongman he tried to be, instead of the flawed and multifaceted man he truly was. We do this to protect Mexico and to give our nation a national father to find pride in without raising him to any other-wordly status - transforming El Jefe into an earthly symbol for all of Mexico to rally behind. Though the PNR shall always know the truth, the people of Mexico will be spared from this reality, given an idealized El Jefe to always look up to."
MEX_Expand_the_Senates_Power:0 "Expand the Senate's Power"
MEX_Expand_the_Senates_Power_desc:0 "The legislative body of Mexico has withered under the domination of Calles and the PNR - a course that shall now be reversed by President Gil. Under Calles’ rightful successor, the senate shall be granted new powers as the position of the executive is eroded. However, the senate too is still largely dominated by the PNR, so in reality this will simply shift power from Gil - a lone member of the PNR - to the larger body of both the party and the government. This will humanize the face of our regime while bringing it token amounts of republican representation - a huge step for the once-totalitarian Maximato."
MEX_All_under_the_Party:0 "All Under the Party"
MEX_All_under_the_Party_desc:0 "As President Emilio Portes Gil slowly erodes his own position of power, the power of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario only grows. With each chip away at the position of the executive, Gil melds more and more into the wider body of the PNR, taking the spotlight off of himself as he marches the Maximato towards collective rulership. Under the command of our dominant and deeply entrenched party, Mexico shall benefit from the brilliant mind of not one strongman, but many, all unified and working in sync to do what is best for Mexico, our people, our party, and our future. With the party of Calles metamorphosing into a solid, insurmountable bloc like a revolutionary Totalist oligarchy, the Maximato shall enter a new age unlike anything seen before while the PNR rises to become the face of the nation."
MEX_President_Trevino:0 "President Treviño"
MEX_President_Trevino_desc:0 "Crushing the pathetic revisionists Gil and Cárdenas, Manuel Perez Treviño now holds Mexico in his palm as the new Calles. A devout loyalist to the late El Jefe Máximo, Treviño is expected to continue what Calles started by leading the PNR without deviation from his predecessor’s plan for Mexico. By elevating El Jefe to a position of national reverence that borders on worship and by further solidifying power within the hands of the executive, Treviño shall be Mexico’s new strongman - an honorable and steadfast replacement for our fallen Caudillo."
MEX_Our_Martyr:0 "Our Martyr"
MEX_Our_Martyr_desc:0 "Plutarco Calles was the greatest Mexican to ever live! He lived and died for our sins so that Mexico would be born anew under a pure and strong Maximato - the greatest form of government on this planet. El Jefe will never be forgotten, for he shall be elevated to a status fitting of his near-divinity. The spirit of El Jefe Máximo is the embodiment of the new Mexican national consciousness and of the true ideals of the Mexican Revolution; he shall be the perfect martyr to unify the state even further and to bond our Maximato like never before. Calles shall live on in eternity as the symbol of our new Mexican state - a nationalist icon for a nationalist Mexico!"
MEX_Curtail_the_Senates_Power:0 "Curtail the Senate's Power"
MEX_Curtail_the_Senates_Power_desc:0 "The legislature of Mexico has rotted as the Maximato has risen to greatness. Under Calles, the PNR dominated all branches of the government, strangling revolutionary representative democracy in order to preserve unity and to safeguard El Jefe’s vision for Mexico. With Calles gone, he left the task of fully crushing this naive system unfinished - a task it is now up to President Treviño to complete. The legislative and representational system of Mexico shall become fully and completely dominated by President Treviño and the PNR, for no longer will our Maximato be hindered by the naive pursuit of or reverence for democratic freedoms. With the senate out of the way, all power shall be free to flow into the hands of the PNR and the executive."
MEX_A_Supreme_Leader:0 "A Supreme Caudillo"
MEX_A_Supreme_Leader_desc:0 "El Jefe may be dead, but a new and capable Caudillo has risen to take his place. President Manuel Perez Treviño, now free from the shackles of political opposition, has now begun to amass all power of governance within his own hands. Rising to become a new breed of totalitarian autocrat, President Treviño is prepared to go to greater lengths than even Calles was to achieve total power. With all of Mexico in the palm of his hand, Treviño - the new Caudillo of the Maximato - has risen to become not only the most powerful man in the nation, but once of the most dominant politicians on Earth, for there are few nations on Earth that have allowed one man to hold as much power and influence over their own nation as President Treviño has. Under this new Supreme Leader, Mexico shall be safe as we safeguard the true Revolution and lead the Maximato into eternity."

His promised progressive and industrialist reforms along Orthodox Syndicalist lines tailored specifically to the Mexican nation have won over the populace.

MEX_union_laws:0 "Ley Federal de Trabajo"
MEX_union_laws_desc:0 "Currently, Mexico has rather old laws regarding work and working conditions. We shall enact a 'Federal Work Law' which specifies the individual's rights in the workplace, the labour conditions that can be put forward by companies to their employees, and the role of the state as a mediator in case these regulations are not fulfilled. These new laws shall protect the Mexican worker better than ever before, for the backbone of the nation must be supported and safeguarded at all costs."
MEX_urbanization:0 "Mass Urbanisation Program"
MEX_urbanization_desc:0 "The economic growth that our nation has experienced in the last few years has focused a lot of its economic buildup in the cities, which has in turned increased their population to the point they no longer can hold their populations while upholding social benefits, welfare, and services. We shall begin a program of urbanisation in order to expand the cities and their capacity with the benefit of our citizens in mind. Hopefully, this will improve their quality of life while also allowing our population to soar to new heights without sacrificing personal wellbeing."

MEX_infrastructure_act_desc:0 "Mexico has a very rough terrain which has made private efforts to improve the national infrastructure unprofitable for their interests. With this in mind, we have to enact a national infrastructure act with the goal of improving logistics within our country, for after all, no one's going to do it for us. The Comisión Vial Revolucionaria Mexicana - or the Mexican Revolutionary Highway Commission - shall be created as a official bureau of the state, whose job it will be to lay lay down new state-financed roads across Mexico, finally connecting our disparate population centers to each other and to our vital military, industry, and agricultural sectors."
MEX_federalism:0 "Syndicalist Federalism"
MEX_federalism_desc:0 "Mexico has, for some time now, been a federal nation, with many states under our banner. However, most of them have been subjected to closely following the central government without much autonomy at all, leading to a very inefficient and overexerted bureaucracy.

MEX_teacher_unions_desc:0 "Teachers unions have been fighting for better budgets for education since 1919. Considering the changes in administration we have gone through since the end of the Revolution, it would be fair, and even beneficial, if we fulfilled their demands and granted them further funding, powers, and protections. In their hands lie the future of our children, and by empowering their unions, they shall be more inclined to loyally and efficiently educate our future generations under a good, rational, and Socialist curriculum."
MEX_empower_unions:0 "There is Power in a Union"

However, if we truly want to enter the modern age and fully apply the innovations our European brothers have made for Socialism, we have to begin a transition towards an industrialized society. Direct union democracy, collective bargaining, federalist principles, and other major tenants of Syndicalism shall come to fuse our democracy and our industry and unions into one syncretic whole dedicated to directly and truthfully representing the will of the unionized masses. The herald of this transition shall be President Toledano, and the foundation of it shall be Syndicalism!"

Though the Ejidos system still causes friction, many have begun to show signs of profitability and efficiency, so to further Socialize and Syndicalize our agri-industry, unions must be brought to our farmers and ranchers. Taking advantage of our momentum, we will create a national agricultural union - the 'Confederación Nacional Campesina' or 'CNC' - so that even the rights of the lowliest of farmers are secured in our country. With all of our farmers organized into one united and strong bloc, there is no stopping them from achieving their Syndicalist justice while supporting our growing state."

We shall reward their loyalty by granting them official state support in order to help them win their fight against their rival labor organization in the CROM.

As such, it falls short in certain aspects when put into practice, especially when considering countries outside that continent. However, we've found those flaws in their theories and we shall correct them as we go, creating our own version of Mexican Syndicalism that puts our needs and goals first above any foreign dream or idea.

MEX_Red_Tinted_Democracy_desc:0 "With multiple terms having now passed with our Revolutionary Democracy still standing, reality has sunk in with most Mexicans that this form of fair, representative, and Socialist form of government is here to stay. The ideals of the Mexican Revolution have been upheld and brought to fruition, and now the masses rejoice for their voices are well and truly heard. Though we are still only just beginning on our journey into Socialis, we do so with hope in our hearts and with the peace of mind that our Mexican democracy is well and truly safe. Let us now walk into our new shared future, together, as one Mexican people."

# SocDem #
MEX_socdem_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PLM"
MEX_socdem_second_term_desc:0 "The Partido Laborista Mexicano has clinched another democratic term, once again ensuring that Mexico walks the moderated path to Socialism. With a party policy seeking to balance our agrarian past with our industrialized future, the PLM hopes to guide Mexico into the land of balanced, moderated, and non-radical Socialism while adhering strictly to mainline democracy. Now, only time will tell if this pink rose of Social Democracy flourishes or finally wilts under the pressure of statehood."
MEX_Balance_Agrarianism_Industralization:0 "Balance Agrarianism and Industrialization"
MEX_Balance_Agrarianism_Industralization_desc:0 "In order for Mexico to well and truly prosper, an equal balance must be struck between our competing economic sectors. The rising tide of industrialization is important, but it mustn’t suffocate our long-standing agrarian industry. Both sectors must be expanded, modernized, and made more efficient without one rising in importance or in attention over the other. Only with these two halves in sync can our Mexico truly prosper and reach modernity."
MEX_The_Pink_Rose:0 "The Pink Rose Blossoms"
MEX_The_Pink_Rose_desc:0 "From a revolutionary seed into a blossoming pink rosebush, our Mexican democracy has been through much peril and tribulations, but we have come out on top, unwilted and flourishing like never before. Moderate Socialism has been brought to Mexico by democratic referendums of her people, and it is here to stay. Our republic is a shining pink beacon to the world proving that non-radical Socialism truly is the way to lasting peace and prosperity. We have achieved our initial reforms and goals, and have brought freedom, liberty, and prosperity to the Mexican people, and though this has just been a first step, our foundations are secure. This pink rose has firmly planted root, and no force of reactionary thought or corruption shall uproot this beautiful bloom."

# RadSoc #
MEX_radsoc_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PNA"
MEX_radsoc_second_term_desc:0 "The Partido Nacional Agrarista has come out on top yet again, continuing the legacy of Zapata and Pancho Villa. Expected to further expand the Ejido system of collective farming and to solidify Mexico as a truly agrarian nation, the PNA has their mandate, and now it is time they put it into action. Under their watch, the farmers, ranchers, and wider peasantry of Mexico - our very society’s backbone - shall find the prosperity they deserve."
MEX_entrench_Ejido_System:0 "Entrench the Ejido System"
MEX_entrench_Ejido_System_desc:0 "The collective farming system known as the Ejidos must come to fully dominate our agricultural system. The Ejidos have increased agricultural efficiency, have a better return on investment each season for our farmers, and have fostered cooperation between our workers while increasing output, at least after the growing pains of such drastic reorganization has passed. The legacy of Zapata shall be continued as the Ejido system is fully entrenched into our society. Collectivized farming is the future, and the PNA shall be our guide to this agrarian destiny."
MEX_Our_Bright_Fields:0 "Our Bright Fields"
MEX_Our_Bright_Fields_desc:0 "These golden fields before us go on for untold miles as they glisten in the sunlight, reflecting the sun’s rays as well as the rays of hope from the masses of Mexico. These masses hope for prosperity and freedom, for liberty and a peaceful future. For generations, they have waited on these empty hopes and dreams under oppressive regime after oppressive regime, but all that has been undone with the birth of our republic. Now, with the aid of the PNA, the masses of Mexico have planted these hopes in the ground and nurtured them until they became reality, growing both new verdant fields and a new prosperous society that upholds our traditions without falling prey to the mistakes or inefficiencies of the past. These bright fields are our past, our present, and our future, and as long as they continue to glisten in the sun each harvest season, Mexico and its people shall be alright."

# Synd #
MEX_syndie_second_term:0 "Second Term of the PPS"
MEX_syndie_second_term_desc:0 "The Partido Popular Socialista has secured another term democratic term, and now seek to further drive Mexico towards their fusion of Mexican Socialism and Syndicalism. Under the PPS, Mexico shall march towards total unionization as the workers and laborers of Mexico are finally uplifted and given the representation and welfare they have long deserved. With their union allies in the CTM, Mexico shall cast off all reactionary thought, capitalist notions, and predatory policy to become the Proletarian Republic our people deserve."
MEX_Unite_All_Unions:0 "Unite All Unions Under the CTM"
MEX_Unite_All_Unions_desc:0 "In order to better organize the various unions of our growing Syndicalist system, the Confederación de Trabajadores de México shall be created. This confederation of labor unions shall stand as one of the main pillars of the PPS’ rule, allowing the party to better organize and administer the growing sea of unions that has come to fill the nation. With all voices, all representatives, and all unions flowing into one main body, we shall ride into our Socialist destiny without fail."
MEX_The_Woker_Base:0 "A Proud Proletariat"
MEX_The_Woker_Base_desc:0 "The worker base of our Mexican republic has been uplifted! Finally, their voices can all be heard, and each has a representative that carries these voices to the ears of those in power. A near-perfect representative Red democracy has been formed here on their backs, with our prosperity being the fruit of their labors and hardships. These heroes of Mexico shall finally be given the recognition, the respect, and the benefits they deserve, for they are the lifeblood of our very nation. Without this solid backbone of trusted, uplifted, and proud proletarians, our journey towards true Syndicalism and Socialist utopia would surely collapse into dust. Mexico is finally a nation of, by, and for its workers."

###Reconquista###
MEX_Reconquista:0 "La Reconquista de la Cesión Mexicana"
MEX_Reconquista_desc:0 "With the Yanquis embroiled in a devastating civil conflict, perhaps the time has come to avenge the loss of the old Northern Territories that we suffered during the Mexican-American War and the chaos that surrounded it. We will bleed the Federales dry and smash aside their bickering radicals in order to secure the lands we lost almost a century ago. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the Mexican Cession, and the Texas Revolution shall all be avenged!"
MEX_California:0 "The March to Alta California"
MEX_California_desc:0 "With our first foray across the border and into American land being successfully and with part of the North secured, it is time for the second stage of the Reconquista to begin! We now march West and North to retake the true crown jewel of the West Coast - Alta California. We will not be stopped from reclaiming our destiny! Viva Mexico!"
MEX_Texas:0 "Cross the Rio Grande"
MEX_Texas_desc:0 "As we successfully perform our first crossings into Yanqui territory, the time to undo the Texas Revolution and the American integration of Texas is finally at hand. With this next phase of the Reconquista now in motion, we shall cross the Rio Grande and march into El Paso and beyond, crushing any resistance in our wake as we move to reclaim our rightful clay!"
MEX_WCC:0 "Take Back New Mexico"
MEX_WCC_desc:0 "The Western Command Center lies to the North - lording over our rightful clay that is Santa Fe de Nuevo México. They sit exposed, with their soft underbelly directly pointed at our armed forces. We shall march into the beautiful, arid lands of Nuevo México and take back the ‘American Southwest’ for our own people, finally undoing the vile Cession of 1848!"
MEX_Reorganize_The_North:0 "Reorganize the North"
MEX_Reorganize_The_North_desc:0 "Much has changed in the Old North since we left in 1848. People, cities, infrastructure - everything is nearly unrecognizable. However, reintegrating the North this will surely be no challenge for our strong and united Mexico, for we have already gone through the rigors of multiculturalism and thus have the experience to know how to handle the Yanquis and all the trouble they will bring. We shall tame this northern expanse just as we tamed the wilds of Mexico, and the gringos shall be brought to heel."
MEX_Women:0 "Our Policy on Yanqui Women"
MEX_Women_desc:0 "The laws on women differ between our nation and the former United States - differences that will have to be rectified in this new status quo we find ourselves in. Whether it be on their right to own property, their right to vote, or whatever else, the rights and laws of the Northern women will have to be hashed out and legislated or de-legislated to fit the needs and expectations of their new nation - our Mexico."
MEX_Religion:0 "The Status of Anglo Religions"
MEX_Religion_desc:0 "As with so many other Northern cultural elements that have come into question following the Reconquista, the largely Protestant religions of the North have now come to the forefront of the debate. One wrong decision or misstep, and we might have given the gringos another reason to take up arms against us, so we must delicately approach this situation lest these heretical Yanquis get uppity."
MEX_Language:0 "The Language Question"
MEX_Language_desc:0 "Mexico may have a multicultural and multilingual past, but the fact remains that the new Northerners speak in a tongue that is foreign from our own. As such, they are mostly free to conspire against us. Some hardliners claim we should introduce harsher sanctions on the English language, while their critics claim it will turn the Yanquis even further against us. We need to solve this debate and fast to set us on our course of integration."
MEX_Hollywood:0 "What to do with Tinseltown?"
MEX_Hollywood_desc:0 "The heart of the American film industry - the decadent and infamous Hollywood - has now come under our control. An economic paradise and cultural beacon as well as a den of debauchery and sin, Hollywood is one of our most division acquisitions in the Reconquista, with just as many calling for it to be burned to the ground as there are people calling for us to repurpose it for our own uses. As part of our larger reorganization of the Northern Territories, we have to decide what to do with it."
MEX_Alamo:0 "The Alamo Question"
MEX_Alamo_desc:0 "With Tejas now in the possession of its rightful owners, the old Misión San Antonio de Valero, or Misión de Álamo, has returned to our hands. For us, the Alamo is a symbol of perverted Holy ground, national humiliation, and wretched treason. However, for the Anglo-Texans, it persists as an enduring symbol of freedom. The question now stands; do we leave it be, or do we tear it down?"
MEX_Natives:0 "Our Stance on the Northern Natives"
MEX_Natives_desc:0 "The retaken territories in the North contain a lot of Native Americans, from the Navajo and Pueblo to the Commanche and Mojave, who have all now come under our control. However, some of these Amerindians are resentful of being under yet another foreign country, while others are instead thankful we have liberated them from Yanqui oppression. We, however, still aren't sure how to properly deal with them - a debate we must now work out."
MEX_Secret_Police:0 "Establish the Guardia Fronteriza"
MEX_Secret_Police_desc:0 "In order to quell the Anglo Rebellion, the Intelligence Ministry has proposed the establishment of a new secret police, in order to disrupt their activities and break up the seperatist Anglo cells. Such an agency will not only turn the tide against the rebellion, but it will also give any other internal subverters and Yanqui terrorists pause the next time they think about raiding our settlements. On the surface, they shall don the mask of the ‘Guardia Fronteriza de la Reconquista Mexicana’ - or the Border Guard of the Mexican Reconquest - a normal government agency dedicated to border safety. However, under the surface they shall operate above the law as the state’s own secret police who will wage an underground war against Anglo rebels in service of the nation."
MEX_Vigilantees:0 "Recruit Vigilantes"
MEX_Vigilantees_desc:0 "Perhaps the solution to end the Anglo Rebellion is not establishing a secret police after all, for such a move would likely only anger the Yanquis and sow more distrust within our nation. Instead, our eyes turn to an alternate proposal; namely, recruit loyal Tejanos, Amerindians, and just about any other volunteer into vigilante gangs. These volunteer brigades shall be used as an informal and independently organized arm of the state who shall utilize their own methods to handle the Yaunqui menace while keeping our own hands clean. We shall fight these bandits and rebels with bandidos and rebels of our own."
MEX_End_The_Rebellion:0 "An End to the Yanqui Rebellion"
MEX_End_The_Rebellion_desc:0 "We have taken the necessary measures, and the tide of the rebellion has been turned. It is time to end this uprising once and for all. The losses of 1845, 1846, and 1848 have all been avenged - Mexico is finally whole once more, and with our new policies and ordinances, the gringo menace is nothing but a distant memory. After our final death blow has been dealt, Mexico will be truly safe and secure, restored to its former territorial glory. Peace has nearly been brought to the expansive and wild North, and now the Mexican eagle soars from California to the Yucatan, reborn like a phoenix from the ashes and ready to face its new future head on!"
MEX_Looking_Outwards:0 "Looking Outwards and Onwards"
MEX_Looking_Outwards_desc:0 "With the lands of the Reconquista restored both to our hands and to order, and with our internal troubles dealt with and our economy improving, it is finally time to properly take a look at Mexico's status on the world stage and for ways to improve our international position. Destiny is dawning for our people and our nation, and we are now prepared to grasp it, so let us take this new destiny in stride as we blitz towards our new future!"
MEX_Push_Our_Broader_Claims:0 "Push Our Broader Claims"
MEX_Push_Our_Broader_Claims_desc:0 "All across the New World and beyond, there lies lands that are rightfully ours! From the jungles of Central America to the islands of the Caribbean or the Philippines, these Hispanic lands are our fellow sons of Spanish Colonialism. It is our duty to reunite these lands in order to better our shared race, culture, and heritage. ¡Andale!"
MEX_Unite_Cosmic_Race:0 "Unite the Cosmic Race"
MEX_Unite_Cosmic_Race_desc:0 "Seeking to put the ideas put forth in his ‘La Raza Cósmica’, José Vasconcelos has begun preparations to unite the cosmic and syncretic Fifth Race under our united banner. As we seek to bring together the depressed race that inhabits the Hispanic-Mestizo world, we shall blend together our images to forge a new identity entirely separate from any that have come before us. Onwards to the universal era of humanity; onwards to Universópolis!"
MEX_Destiny_of_Latin_America:0 "Mexico's Rightful Place in North America"
MEX_Destiny_of_Latin_America_desc:0 "For far too long has Mexico played second-fiddle to the other powers of North America, but this legacy stops now! We shall rise to dominate the New World as we dethrone the crumbling Americans from their long-held position as hegemon of the Americas. Now is the time for Mexico to take its rightful place in the sun!"
MEX_sunset_invasion:0 "The Sunset Invasion"
MEX_sunset_invasion_desc:0 "Centuries ago, the foul Hernán Cortés and his Conquistadors sailed across the Atlantic and brought ruin to the old Triple Alliance. At first, our people, our priests, and even our tlatoanis felt that these wielders of exploding sticks capable of murdering our ancestors from afar were the Teotls themselves - our gods come to grace their people while riding atop massive four-legged beasts astride scores of guardians in shining armor. Oh how wrong our ancestors were. The Conquistadors wrought havoc upon our empire, bringing about the collapse of our very civilization and the enslavement of our culture and history to the foul hispanics. With the rise of our new Triple Alliance however, there is a chance that we could finally exact our revenge on these false Teotls after all these years. Come our fellow Aztecah, we shall bring about the setting sun of the foul Hispanic dominators once and for all!"
## Military ##
# Army #
MEX_army_modernization:0 "Modernize the Ejército Mexicano"
MEX_army_modernization_desc:0 "The Mexican armed forces are still using outdated equipment from the Weltkrieg-era, and our military doctrines and tactics have also fallen behind the times over the past decade. We have to move forward from the Revolution if we are to project our influence over the Americas once more. Our nation is a major player in North and Central America economically and diplomatically, so our army must be able to back up our words."

MEX_guerilla_warfare:0 "Guerra de Guerrilas"
MEX_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "Mexico's terrain is extremely harsh with various deserts, mountain ranges, and jungles. Already during the Mexican Revolution, guerrilla tactics have proven to be highly effective in such terrain which doesn't permit for large, heavily-equipped armies. While we continue our industrialization efforts, establishing local militias and guerilla training will keep our regime safe for now."
MEX_zapatas_training:0 "Zapata's Legacy"
MEX_zapatas_training_desc:0 "It was thanks to Emiliano Zapata's excellent military tactics that we managed to defeat the counter-revolutionaries. His guerrilla tactics and logistical genius have successfully defeated the federalist forces, and he provides a great foundation to build upon our army. If we follow his teachings, no army will be able to penetrate the heart of Mexico."
MEX_night_ambushes:0 "Hunters of the Night"
MEX_night_ambushes_desc:0 "An invading army can get overwhelmed or lost when encroaching on the mountainous mazes that dot the Mexican countryside. This hopelessness can be multiplied tenfold when they are harried at night by complete darkness, accompanied by the flashes of our rifles. We should undergo extreme night training regiments so our soldiers become hunters of the night, as deadly as the stalking jaguar, ambushing enemy forces and slinking back into the night like ghosts."
MEX_citizen_soldier:0 "Citizen Soldiers"
MEX_citizen_soldier_desc:0 "A guerilla force should not only be made up of professional soldiers, but every citizen should also be able to participate in the fight against the enemy. Every citizen has a duty to protect their beloved country, resorting to the trusty Mondragon, which will be given to every servant of Mexico. With special citizen militias, we can make sure that every citizen will be able to fulfill his or her duties to Mexico."
MEX_decentralized_command:0 "Adapt the Revolutionaries' Doctrines"
MEX_decentralized_command_desc:0 "It is difficult to command a guerilla unit in the deserts of Sonora or the jungles of Yucatan from Mexico City, and precious hours and minutes can be lost waiting for commands to come in from hundreds of miles away. Our command structure should be more decentralized with local commanders having enough autonomy to perform well during guerilla attacks."
MEX_recon_scouts:0 "Vigila las Dunas"
MEX_recon_scouts_desc:0 "An invading army fears the ambush, where the strength of numbers and firepower means nothing against the element of surprise an abject terror. However, coordinating a perfect ambush is difficult, even for a veteran unit. To help facilitate this, elite scout units will be trained to locate and corral enemy armies like sheepdogs."
MEX_small_unit_tactics:0 "The Basic Unit of the Army"
MEX_small_unit_tactics_desc:0 "Guerilla units have to be flexible and small. Large platoons or divisions do not allow this, and in turn, are not feasible for our army. We must decentralize all of our armed forces, and our military schools must evolve small unit tactics that prioritize mobility and flexibility over standard army formations and procedures."
MEX_die_standing:0 "Die Standing"
MEX_die_standing_desc:0 "Not a single meter of Mexican soil shall fall to the counter-revolutionaries and the imperialists! Our glorious soldiers shall defend every corner of Mexico, and they shall never yield! Mexico shall stay free, no matter the cost."

MEX_legacy_of_the_revolution:0 "Legacy of the Revolution"
MEX_legacy_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Mexican Revolution was one of the largest military events in the recent history of our continent. Together with its sheer size, it has also brought new military tactics and weapons to Mexico. We should build up our army on the lessons learned from the war."
MEX_improve_soldiers:0 "Promote the Heroico Colegio Militar"
MEX_improve_soldiers_desc:0 "In order to train the next generation of Mexican officers, we shall grant great funding to the Heroico Colegio Militar and implement a series of officer competency tests in order to weed out those placed in our ranks through nepotism. The academy shall work in tandem with our current military and government to ensure we have a steady flow of intelligent, calm, and calculated recruits to lead our men in the future."
MEX_desert_training:0 "Learn from División del Norte"
MEX_desert_training_desc:0 "One of our largest rivals on the American continent is the United States of America, which tries to undermine Mexico's freedom. The Mexican-American border is mostly made of deserts and arid mountains, so we should train our soldiers to stop the US forces in this hostile environment. Luckily, the División del Norte is expert at fighting in these conditions, so we shall expand these desert riders and have them teach the rest of the army."
MEX_jungle_training:0 "Yucateco Stratagems"
MEX_jungle_training_desc:0 "The revolution started out in the jungles of Southern Mexico, and the revolution shall be spread through the jungles of Central and Latin America. Our army should focus on adapting to this extremely hostile terrain, as it will form the battlefield of the future wars."
MEX_solderas:0 "Soldaderas"
MEX_solderas_desc:0 "During the Mexican Revolution, many women fought for the principles of the revolution. These 'soldaderas' have proven their strength and will on the battlefield, but women are still frowned upon in the military. We should end this discrimination and permit women to fight in our armed forces."
MEX_future_of_war:0 "Future of Warfare"
MEX_future_of_war_desc:0 "The future of warfare is dependent on the future of the equipment used. In order to prepare for the conflicts of tomorrow, which will undoubtedly challenge the integrity and freedom of Mexico, we will need to think today about the future of equipment."
MEX_industrial_warfare:0 "Invest in Productos Mendoza"
MEX_industrial_warfare_desc:0 "While the strength of our Mexican soldiers is high, the strength of a Mexican artillery piece is even higher. We need to equip our army with heavy infantry-support weapons to improve its fighting capabilities against a regular enemy force."
MEX_mechanized_warfare:0 "Request DINA Armor Designs"
MEX_mechanized_warfare_desc:0 "While the strength of our Mexican soldiers is high, and while the strength of a Mexican artillery piece is even higher, the strength of a Mexican tank is the highest! We need to mechanize our forces so that no regular enemy force can defeat us."
MEX_trundlers_of_the_sonora:0 "Trundlers of the Sonora"
MEX_trundlers_of_the_sonora_desc:0 "If there is one thing that modern conflicts have taught Mexico, it is that the armored tank will be the harbinger of victory. We must ensure that the Mexican armor corps are superb to those of the northern Yankees. We shall be impervious defensibly, and unstoppable offensively."
MEX_reapers_of_borders:0 "Reapers of the Border"
MEX_reapers_of_borders_desc:0 "Mexico must be kept safe from all sides - Pacific, Caribbean, North, and South. Every inch of Mexican heartland will be paid for by the enemy, in gallons upon gallons of spilt blood, blood spilt by our great, patriotic men."

MEX_general_staff:0 "Herederos de Guadalupe Victoria"
MEX_general_staff_desc:0 "The most effective fighting force is a professional, well regulated regular army, such as the army that Guadalupe Victoria led in order to free us from the Spanish centuries ago. However, our armed forces are quite the opposite. We need to reform most aspects of our army in order to move past this period of revolutionary rabble to be more organized like our national forefathers, and we should start with the general staff and the command structure."
MEX_modern_division_structure:0 "Study Imperial German Order of Battle"
MEX_modern_division_structure_desc:0 "A modern division has a complicated structure, meanwhile a Mexican division is just a few infantry battalions. We need to completely restructure the division template of the Mexican armed forces."
MEX_military_college:0 "Create the Escuela Superior de Guerra"
MEX_military_college_desc:0 "One major aspect of what makes a professional army is a trained and large officer corps. Our army is short on experienced officers on all levels of the command structure, so we will need to expand our military colleges to train more officers. We shall begin this initiative by creating the Escuela Superior de Guerra in the capital, serving as the centerpiece of our new officer training programs."
MEX_professional_army:0 "Memories of the Great Caudillos"
MEX_professional_army_desc:0 "The goal of our major military reforms is to create a professional, modern army like that organized by the great independence heroes Santa Anna or Vicente Guerrero. While we will aspire to create a modern army by improving our equipment and tactics, a professional army can only be achieved if every soldier knows his duties and is willing to fulfill them under any condition."
MEX_centralized_command:0 "A New Age Beyond the Revolution"
MEX_centralized_command_desc:0 "If we give local commanders too much autonomy, our armed forces and HQ will drown in chaos once we meet the enemy as no one will know what exactly is happening. We need a regulated and centralized command structure to properly lead the army."
MEX_logistics:0 "Conquest of the Impassable"
MEX_logistics_desc:0 "Due to our harsh terrain and underdeveloped infrastructure, it will be difficult to properly supply a large army with much heavy equipment. We need special units which oversee and organize the supply lines to keep our army always fully equipped."
MEX_flexiable_planning:0 "Elastic Plans and Flexible Strategies"
MEX_flexiable_planning_desc:0 "Helmuth von Moltke the Elder accurately said that 'no battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy', and that has been perfectly proven by the chaotic battles of the Mexican Revolution. Our plans need to be flexible so that they can adapt to new circumstances quickly."
MEX_siempre_leales:0 "Siempre Leales"
MEX_siempre_leales_desc:0 "The Mexican military will always loyally serve Mexico, no matter the cost. It will always protect our beautiful nation, in war or in peace, from any threat, foreign or internal. 'Siempre Leales', Always Loyal."

# Navy #
MEX_navy:0 "Expand the Armada de México"
MEX_navy_desc:0 "Our naval forces will not be able to challenge the navies of the Entente and of the United States, but its fighting power is not to be underestimated. Our nation has a large coastline, and our navy is ready to defend it."

MEX_grand_navy:0 "The Gulf for Mexico!"
MEX_grand_navy_desc:0 "There are no jungles or mountains to hide in for the navy. While fighting with small, concealed units is a viable tactic for the ground forces, our naval forces will need to win naval engagements with large ships with even larger firepower."
MEX_naval_glory:0 "Support the Heroica Escuela Naval Militar"
MEX_naval_glory_desc:0 " We should take pride in our naval forces which bravely defend the shores of Mexico and move to support our grandy navy. A new naval military academy shall rise in order to train the next generation of midshipmen and admirals so that we are ever ready at the helm and on the waves."
MEX_battleships:0 "Reverse-Engineer the Anáhuac"
MEX_battleships_desc:0 "The sight of the Anáhuac is enough to impress most people and its 234mm guns are larger than any artillery pieces that our ground forces field. She is the largest ship of our navy, yet it is more than three decades old and will not be able to compete with modern capital ships. We need to develop our own proper battleship to serve as the new flagship of our navy."
MEX_battle_cruisers:0 "Invite Foreign Naval Engineers"
MEX_battle_cruisers_desc:0 "Our naval industrial capacity is quite limited, so it will prove a difficult task to build up a force consisting of large battleships. We should accompany our larger capital ships with smaller but effective battlecruisers, and utilize foreign experts to help us figure out how best to do so."
MEX_carriers:0 "Commission the Castillo Breton"
MEX_carriers_desc:0 "A new ship type has emerged during the Weltkrieg, the carrier! Initially meant for sea planes, new large carriers have the capacity of a small airfield and can now support the naval forces with large, torpedo and bomb carrying, aircraft."
MEX_naval_aircraft:0 "Expand the New Fuerza AeroNaval"
MEX_naval_aircraft_desc:0 "The air force has become a vital part of the military. While some doubt the effectivity of aircraft to perform precision strikes, most are convinced that they will play a major role in the future ground and naval battles. The navy has requested the formation of a naval aviation branch."

MEX_marines:0 "Fuerza de Infantería de Marina"
MEX_marines_desc:0 "Sometimes, it is easier to bypass the enemy forces by sea than to fight through entrenched lines in difficult terrain. While naval operations like the Battle of Gallipoli have failed, the invasion from the sea might become a viable military tactic."

MEX_protect_trade:0 "Unfettered Gulf Riches"
MEX_protect_trade_desc:0 "Our navy will simply never be able to compete with the major navies of the world, so instead of trying to compete nonetheless, we should focus on defending our trade lines within the Gulf, in the Caribbean, and across the Pacific instead. While we can't beat the US fleet, we can beat pirates and raiders."
MEX_coast_guard:0 "Búsqueda y Rescate Marítimo"
MEX_coast_guard_desc:0 "Our nation has a large coastline, both along the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, which provides enough hiding places for raiders and smugglers. We need to patrol our coasts to stop these criminals. The new Maritime Search and Rescue organization shall handle these tasks with great efficiency as we focus on other tasks."
MEX_destroyers:0 "Purchase Old Spanish Vessels"
MEX_destroyers_desc:0 "A large battleship is not very suited for convoy escort missions. Instead, we should invest in small escort destroyers which can protect our convoys will being cost-efficent and reliable."
MEX_heavy_cruisers:0 "Make Good on the 1932 Naval Plan"
MEX_heavy_cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers form the middle ground between battleships and destroyers. They are jack of all trades, but they still are subdivided into various classes. In case we ever need to engage a more regular fleet, we will need heavier cruisers to serve as 'mini-battleships'."
MEX_submarines:0 "Study the Imperial U-Boat"
MEX_submarines_desc:0 "We will need to protect our trade lines, but that doesn't stop us from raiding the trade lines of our enemies. Submarines are perfectly suited for convoy raiding missions, swimming along silently like the sea snakes and eels that fill our waters, so we should invest more into the silent death from below the sea line."
MEX_light_cruisers:0 "A Modern Zaragosa"
MEX_light_cruisers_desc:0 "A heavy cruiser is well suited for engaging as a regular fighting vessel, but most of our adversaries won't be fielding anything heavier than destroyers or similar ships. In order to save on resources, light cruisers are the way to go."

# Air Force #
MEX_air:0 "Fund the Fuerza Aérea Mexicana"
MEX_air_desc:0 "Originally formed as the Arma de Aviación Militar in 1915, the Mexican Air Force has been instrumental in suppressing rebellion. However, in the dawn of a new era, one where Mexico shall triumph, its air force must reflect the upcoming golden age."
MEX_pilot_training:0 "Point to El Colegio del Aire"
MEX_pilot_training_desc:0 "Our air force is still quite small so we lack trained pilots. An aircraft is useless if the pilot doesn't know how to fly it. We need to expand our aviation training courses."
MEX_air_ports:0 "Construct the Aeropuerto Central"
MEX_air_ports_desc:0 "Built on the site of the Llanos de Balbuena which has been used for auernaturical experiments for decades, the new Mexico City Central Airport shall rise to be the crowning jewel of our nation’s aeronautical infrastructure. With this massive airfield and others like it rising all across Mexico along with many more smaller airstrips and runways, we will come to blanket the skies with our aircraft."
MEX_air_defense:0 "Sterilize the Skies"
MEX_air_defense_desc:0 "We aren't the only ones to build up an air force... far from it actually. Our air force will most likely be on the defense if we have to face the major counter-revolutionary and imperialist air forces, so we should aid them from the ground."

### Events - start up ###

mexico.1.t:0 "The Golden Eagle of the South"
mexico.1.d:0 "Mexico’s history is long, rich, and exceedingly diverse, but has been plagued by one main invariable and nearly unending reality - War. Whether it be against America in 1845 or against itself in 1857, Mexico’s history has been defined by rival thinkers and ambitious idealogues launching war after war and revolt after revolt in fleeting attempts at imposing their own form of government on the rest of the country. This atmosphere of unabated conflict momentarily ended with the rise of Porfirio Díaz, who secured power by appeasing both Conservatives and Liberals across the nation, leading Mexico through an age of unparalleled modernization and advancement, but also an age of inequality and intense social strife. \n\nLike all dictators though, he wasn’t eternal and was deposed in 1911 in a mostly bloodless revolution, but his followers didn’t stay idle, and they would attempt to restore the old dictatorship, with Victoriano Huerta leading a counter-coup in 1913. This move threw the country into the throes of a real civil war, and thus the Mexican Revolution fully began. \n\nAmid the chaos and ever-shifting web of deals and alliances, three main sides coalesced: the populist alliance of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, the constitutionalist clique of Venustiano Carranza and Álvaro Obregón, and finally the 'Porfirist' camp led by Victoriano Huerta and Manuel Mondragón."
mexico.1.a:0 "Then what happened?"

mexico.1200.t:0 "A New Year Dawns for the Southern Eagle"
mexico.1200.d:0 "After years of intense fighting, Victoriano Huerta and his alliance were defeated in 1915, even though peace seemed impossible for a moment as the American intervention and their landing in Veracruz led to a short ceasefire between most factions to kick the Yankees out. With Huerta deposed, a conference was called by the Populists, who invited the Constitutionalists to form a new United Government. Despite their overtures however, Venustiano Carranza would reject the offer. Soon after, Álvaro Obregon defected from Carranza’s clique when he was shown possibly-falsified evidence by an officer that Carranza planned to have him assassinated. After this defection, Carranza was left with virtually no allies, and was swiftly defeated by 1916. However, President Woodrow Wilson of the United States, deciding that Carranza was better than the 'Socialists' in the Populist army, sent weapons and troops to Carranza’s stronghold in Veracruz while also making small expeditions into the nation through the border. This new gringo intervention led to tensions and even more defections within Carranza’s camp as information about this deal began to leak to the wider public. Finally, in 1920, Pablo González Garza assassinated Carranza and defected to the camp of the now elected President Álvaro Obregón, finally ending the Mexican Revolution. \n\nThankfully, Obregon was able to form a United government by supporting Pancho Villa’s governorship of Chihuahua and by appointing Emiliano Zapata as Secretary of Agriculture, and after two successive presidents since the revolution hailing from Obregon’s PLM (those being Francisco R. Serrano and Luis N. Morones), Zapata and his PNA were elected in 1932. \n\nWhile he is broadly popular, Zapata’s election also led to the creation of the Alianza Antisocialista and the Liga Democrática, with both groups violently opposing his somewhat radical, Socialist views. With Zapata’s fourth year in office just beginning and with tensions rising across the nation, Mexico sits on a razor’s edge once more. Whether it will finally break the cycle of unending strife and warfare, or if it succumbs to its seemingly inescapable destiny once again is another question."

### Events - assassination and first elections ###

mexico.2.t:0 "An Assassin Strikes at Zapata!"
mexico.2.d:0 "Breaking news has struck Mexico City like lightning, for it would seem that disaster has befouled President Zapata’s address to the nation. While standing atop a stage, speaking from a lectern to a massive crowd of thousands before him that filled the Zócalo, a bone-chilling crack ripped through the air, silencing the crowd before a second crack sent Zapata toppling to ground. A lone gunman, hidden among the masses, fired two shots at the President from less than 30 feet away - an embarrassment to his security detail of Constitutional Guards. Even more embarrassing, in the ensuing panic, it would seem that the assassin escaped without a trace, which will certainly have to be dealt with later. As the news of this horrid attack spreads throughout the nation like a thunderous wave, the wounded Zapata has been rushed off to the Iglesia y Hospital de Jesús Nazareno in order for doctors to attempt to save his life. With the nation still reeling from this horrid atrocity, the people weep while the opportunistic wolves circle, and many throughout the country now wonder what will become of the Tiger of the South."
mexico.2.a:0 "With the round missing vital organs, Zapata survives the attempt on his life."
mexico.2.b:0 "Dios mío! Zapata has been slain!"

mexico.3.t:0 "The Death of Zapata"
mexico.3.d:0 "Despite desperate attempts to save his life by our most skilled doctors, President and war hero Emiliano Zapata Salazar has been slain. The lone assassin that fired upon him has now become his murderer, and while the nation mourns, our government is organizing a nation-wide manhunt to catch his killer. With the sudden nature of this power vacuum, our regime had to act quickly to prevent total collapse. As such, our slain President’s brother and confidant Eufemio Zapata has risen as interim president. However, with his famous distaste for command and politics well known and evident, many can already predict that Eufemio will soon give up power to more capable, and more ambitious, hands. \n\nOnly two main groups in our government have any chance of being chosen by Eufemio to take control of the nation in this dire time. The front-runner of the race is Plutarco Calles - infamous political chameleon and party leader of the Totalist PNR. A known strongman and opportunistic authoritarian, Calles has been waiting for his chance to seize power. Opposing him are the power duo of Francisco ‘Pancho’ Villa - famed Revolutionary hero and Agrarian Socialist - and Vicente Lombardo Toldeano - one of the foremost Labor leaders in the nation - who together have promised to form a broad coalition government to oppose Calles’ influence. Both these two giants of the Mexican Left were loyal friends and allies to the late Zapata, and this friendship also extends to his brother, our interim President. However, the power and pressure of Calles erodes all bonds, even those of family and friendship, and many have begun to doubt Eufemio’s ability to resist Calles’ ambition."
mexico.3.a:0 "Plutarco Calles is appointed as temporary Prime Minister."
mexico.3.b:0 "Pancho Villa and Vicente Toledano form a coalition government."

mexico.300.t:0 "The Broad Coalition"
mexico.300.d:0 "In an attempt to resist the oppressive influence of Plutaro Calles and his PNR, Pancho Villa and Vicente Toledano have come together to head a broad coalition of all Leftists and Progressive parties in Mexico. With varying political groups from pink Liberals and Social Democrats to Orthodox Syndicalists and Agricultural Laborists coming together under a massive banner, chaos was inevitable from the start. Despite its noble intentions, the coalition is deteriorating fast, with even the veteran Pancho Villa and esteemed Vicente Toledano both struggling to keep the peace. Unless they can perform a diplomatic miracle and finally foster cooperation birthed from desperation and necessity, their pipedream of a coalition will surely collapse."
mexico.300.a:0 "Against all odds, this big-tent holds firm!"
mexico.300.b:0 "The coalition collapses before it can truly achieve anything."

mexico.301.t:0 "The Military Coups the Coalition"
mexico.301.d:0 "Pancho Villa and Vicente Toledano, despite their best efforts, have been beaten. Despite their experience and best intentions, they were too busy arguing with each other and the other members of the coalition instead of cooperating with each other to work towards an amicable solution for all. Disgusted with their ineffectiveness and sensing the opportunity to strike at this disorganized, shameful, and unprofessional example of ‘leadership,’ a military force led by General Pablo Garza marched into Mexico City early today in order to secure Mexico from inaction and ineptitude. Seizing the government apparatus, Garza and his troops have moved to arrest most of the Socialist government while instituting nation-wide martial law. It would seem that the ideals of the Mexican Revolution are finally dead, for Socialism is no-more in Mexico."
mexico.301.a:0 "How could this happen?"

mexico.302.t:0 "Calles’ Demands"
mexico.302.d:0 "Eufemio Zapata may be interim President, but he desperately does not want the job. A man with no appetite for rule or ambition for power, Eufemio merely wants to find the man who shot his brother. Noticing the perfect opportunity to worm himself in, Plutarco Calles has whispered in Eufemio’s ear, promising to let him lead the investigation into Emiliano Zapata's death if he would just resign and name Calles as the next President. Though Eufemio may be blind to it, this is exactly what Calles has been waiting for, and now the ‘Jefe Máximo’ is just inches away from peacefully obtaining control over Mexico."
mexico.302.a:0 "All I want to do is catch the man who shot my brother. Appoint Calles!"
mexico.302.b:0 "Eufemio overlooks all selfish desires for vengeance, and rises to lead Mexico in its darkest hour."

mexico.303.t:0 "Calles Marches"
mexico.303.d:0 "Despite his best intentions, Eufemio Zapata is doomed, for even though he resisted the siren song of the Jefe Máximo and rose to take his brother’s place despite his own indifference to authority, that has not stopped Calles from getting what he desires. As Eufemio takes his seat at his late brother’s desk within the Palacio Nacional, hundreds of loyal PNR militants and other fervent and violent allies to Calles marched on the capitol. With the Constitutional Guard stretched thin with the on-going manhunt and with the military conveniently nowhere to be found, the Palacio Nacional is largely undefended and unprepared for an attack of such magnitude. \n\nWith Plutarco Calles leading the charge, the compound was quickly overrun, and for the second time in under a year, a Zapata has been slain - shot dead by Calles himself when Eufemio tried to pull a gun on him in a final act of defiance. With the capital under his control and with the second Zapata dead, El Jefe Máximo has finally achieved his lifelong ambition of leading Mexico."
mexico.303.a:0 "Zapata has been slain! Again."

mexico.304.t:0 "Villa Attempts A Countercoup"
mexico.304.d:0 "With Calles having seized power over the nation, chaos and disorder have spread throughout Mexico, for Calles has as many enemies as he does allies and supporters, if not more so. All across our countryside and within our less-supportive cities, Socialist banditos revolt against the rule of El Jefe Máximo. Though varied in their beliefs and disorganized, the vast majority of them have coalesced around the charismatic Pancho Villa, serving as his new Villistas. Though he desires no real position of power, he has risen to do what he believes must be done to safeguard the future and tradition of Mexico. Riding towards Mexico City with a volunteer army at his back, Pancho Villa rides not only to save the nation, but to save the very future of Mexico. However, Calles is not alone in his struggle, and has an army of his own waiting for the vile Socialists to arrive. Now, it is only a matter of time before only one is left standing to lead the nation."
mexico.304.a:0 "Pancho Villa saves the nation from the villainous Calles."
mexico.304.b:0 "Plutarco Calles crushes Pancho Villa and his forces."

mexico.305.t:0 "Garza Attempts A Coup"
mexico.305.d:0 "As Calles continues to consolidate his grip on the nation, beating back any challenge or foe, it has come down to General Pablo Garza to save Mexico from this chameleon’s slick ambitions. Marching into Mexico City with the Constitutionalist Army at his back, General Garza seeks to fight the battered but stalwart Calles for the right to decide Mexico’s fate. With these two strongmen and titans of Mexican governance now doing battle openly in the streets of the capital, it is only a matter of time before a victor stands alone among the rubble. As the forces of Garza and Calles clash like packs of savage, determined beasts, the very destiny of our nation dangles in the balance."
mexico.305.a:0 "Garza saves the nation from Calles’ tyranny."
mexico.305.b:0 "Calles destroys Garza and his men, finally securing Mexico in his grasp."

mexico.306.t:0 "The Question of Villa's Candidacy"
mexico.306.d:0 "With Pancho Villa leading his new Villistas to victory over the villain Calles and his paramilitaries, a new dawn rises over Mexico. Plutarco Calles - El Jefe Máximo - has finally been cast down after his betrayal of Eufemio Zapata, and Socialist democracy has been brought back to dominance once again. With Pancho Villa serving as the interim President, new elections have begun to be organized. However, Pancho Villa himself holds no real desire to hold office or run in the elections, though that has not stopped his allies and compatriots, who have been trying to lift him up as a unity candidate in these rough and uncertain times. With the date of the emergency elections looming, Pancho Villa must make his choice."
mexico.306.a:0 "Despite his apprehension, Pancho Villa decides to run in the elections."
mexico.306.b:0 "Pancho Villa decides to retire from political life with the respect of the nation behind him."

mexico.5.t:0 "Manhunt for the Gunman"
mexico.5.d:0 "Though the man who shot Zapata was able to escape during the initial chaos of the tragic event, our loyal police force was able to track him down to a small bar and motel in the slums of Tlalzipatli at the heart of the capital. Here, the triggerman was gunned down by pursuing police, but not before they could squeeze some vital information out of him. Though he did not give up any names, it would seem that this terrorist did not act alone, likely being supported by one of any number of known criminal groups, defectors, or other enemies of the state. Though it is not much to go on, we now know others are responsible, and one criminal’s death is not enough until everyone responsible for this attack is brought to justice. Under command of the government, every inch of Mexico City and the surrounding region shall be scoured until the group behind the attack on Zapata is found!"
mexico.5.a:0 "We must find these terrorists."

mexico.6.t:0 "The Assassin’s Cohort is Found"
mexico.6.d:0 "Following the only sound lead in weeks, our investigators were finally able to track down the group behind Zapata’s attackers. It turns out that the operation was organized, funded, and planned by a clique of far-Right military leaders and nationalists, who had taken umbrage with Zapata's reforms and sought to tear down the Socialist regime. With this cabal exposed, arrested, and now behind bars, they will be granted the only justice traitors of their ilk deserve - the hot searing of fired brass and lead."
mexico.6.a:0 "They will meet a traitor's death."

mexico.7001.t:0 "Searching for the Assassin"
mexico.7001.d:0 "With the attempt on Zapata’s life still so fresh in the minds of the public, the nation is still in a frenzy as nearly every man, woman, and child searched for the assassin. With most leads coming up as dead ends, we have decided to focus on search effort on one of two possible avenues of investigation. The most obvious one, and the option supported by the vast majority of our administration, is to investigate the nationalist reactionaries in the AAS, such as the Gold Shirts or the Synarchists. While a wise plan, there have been rumors circulating around that the true mastermind behind the attack is none other than famous chameleon and power-hungry revolutionary Plutarco Calles. If this were to be true, it could send shockwaves through Leftist Mexican politics and the wider nation, so we must be deadly certain if we want to pursue this line of thought."
mexico.7001.a:0 "Look into Calles."
mexico.7001.b:0 "Nonsense, the reactionaries are the prime suspect."

mexico.7.t:0 "The Assassin’s Cohort is Found"
mexico.7.d:0 "Following the only sound lead in weeks, our investigators were finally able to track down the group behind Zapata’s attackers. It turns out that the operation was organized, funded, and planned by Plutarco Elías Calles and his PRN. Calles sought to eliminate Zapata in order to weaken the nation, strengthen his own position of power, and to take him one step closer to being able to seize power. While Federal Police had attempted to arrest him, it appears that Calles was wise to our operation. As police units approached Calles' base of operations, they found it abandoned. With Calles no where to seen, and with chaos gripping the nation, the manhunt has been postponed, although a bounty has been placed on Calles' head. Until we can restore order to the nation, Calles is as good as gone, at least for now.   "
mexico.7.a:0 "They will meet a traitor's death."

mexico.8.t:0 "The Funeral of Zapata"
mexico.8.d:0 "Today in Mexico City, a massive and ornate funeral was held for Emiliano Zapata. In honour of the fallen President, almost every shop and storefront in Mexico has been closed, flags across the nation have been lowered to half-mast, and memorials have popped up across the nation. In every corner of the state, the public grieves over this national loss, mourning their fallen hero. No group in Mexico mourns this loss more deeply than the poor and rural masses who he won over with his populist reforms, with many of them coming to the capital to pay their respects and say their peace to their fallen leader. With a national monument being erected in his honor near the Zócalo, Zapata has been interred in a massive state-built mausoleum decorated with lush plant life, beautiful mosaics, and murals of his exploits painted by David Siqueiros and Diego Rivera. With this Hero of the Revolution finally buried and honored after his violent death and the chaos surrounding it, the Tiger of the South may finally rest in peace."
mexico.8.a:0 "He died on his feet, never ceasing to bring prosperity and equality to our people."

mexico.9.t:0 "Negotiating with the LD"
mexico.9.d:0 "Ever since the end of Zapata’s term, there has been worried discussion about what comes next for Mexico. The currently standing ‘Socialist democracy’ only exists tentatively due to the Establishment, made up of the PLM, PNA, and PPS, cooperating to pass a law years ago that banned anyone related to the Liga Democratica from running in democratic elections. Not unfounded, for policies like this have been exceedingly common in Mexican history, that does not change the fact that our position in power is precarious. In order to safeguard our party from further failures while also widening our support base, [root.getleader] has opened up talks with the prominent members of the LD, seeking to earn their support - perhaps even letting them run in elections once again - in order to safeguard Mexican democracy from radical forces that would undo everything our Revolution has achieved. Let us just hope these negotiations don’t fail."
mexico.9.a:0 "Hopefully with their support, we can maintain our form of democracy."

mexico.900.t:0 "Decree on the Secularization of Government"
mexico.900.d:0 "Today Pascal Rubio has announced the PLM’s new program in regards to the Catholic Church. Already on tenuous ground since the Syndicalists took over the Church and Government have maintained an uneasy coexistence but now it seems that peaceful unease has come to an end. The outright persecution feared by many however appears not to be. The PLM, while not exactly happy with religion in concept, realizes the deep link Mexican society has with the Church. Nevertheless the PLM also realizes the undue influence the Church has traditionally exercised on the government. To counter this the PLM has announced it will desecularlize the last bastions of the government by stripping out oaths to faith still required in many public offices and removing the government employed priests. While both these relics of a long gone era have been more or less ignored by a vast majority of government workers, the fact they existed at all was still a problem, a problem that has now been solved. Other than that however they have allowed the Church’s influence on many Mexicans private life to remain. While this has angered the more militant atheists in Mexico to the vast majority of Mexicans not ready to give up a faith they are so deeply tied to, it is a welcome relief."
mexico.900.a:0 "A Wall Between Church and State"

mexico.901.t:0 "Peace at Last"
mexico.901.d:0 "Many devout Mexicans have lived on eggshells since the Revolution. While the government has more or less separated itself from the Church the fear of a total and complete crackdown was always there. Especially due to Calles’s influence and vocal hatred for the Church. However, with [root.getleader] in charge their fears have been nullified somewhat. While [root.getleader] himself is distrustful of the Church, he is still a working class man at heart. Many men like him across Mexico are devout Catholics and while [root.getleader] professes a cool loathing of the Catholic Church, he can still never bring himself to outright oppose it. Instead, according to a recent law, the informal walls between Church and State have been put to law. However, [root.getleader] has pledged to not go further with it for now. All across Mexico a sigh of relief can be heard and the seemingly inevitable clash between the Church and the State has been avoided, and true Secularism has been achieved. For now at least."
mexico.901.a:0 "An Amicable Agreement"

mexico.902.t:0 "A New Status Quo"
mexico.902.d:0 "Since the PPS’s assumption of power many Mexicans rightfully wondered what their policy towards the Church would be. Since the Revolution the State has promised to clear up the status of the Church in relation to the state but until now has been hesitant. That hesitancy has however gone by the wayside. Now the PPS has announced it has reached an agreement with the Church. In recognition of the Church’s long tradition of helping the poor they would be left alone by and large. Catholic-Syndicalist Unions which have already sprung up, run by priests friendly to the Syndicalist cause, will be recognized by the government as well. In return for this the Church has agreed to end its traditional influence on the government. This has been met with sighs of relief from most Mexicans as a conflict between the Church and the state would inevitably turn violent. Instead however, peace has come again and the Church and PPS march into the future, hand in hand and ready to improve the lives of every Mexican."

mexico.2200.d:0 "After one of the most brutal conflicts on Mexican soil since the Revolution, our forces, the forces of Christ the King and of His Holy Church, have emerged victorious. Despite the best attempts of the secular state to completely destroy the Church from Mexico, the opposite has occurred, and the stain of Secularism at last has been cleansed from our fair shores. With our holy and righteous victory however, comes a question, a question of governance. Since even before La Cristiada began, our movement had been greatly divided amongst itself. Having no true unifying leader besides General Gorostieta and having no true goal other than the Defense of the Faith, supporters of everything from a purely Catholic Integralist state, a slightly more Christ-centered Republic or even a theocratic state centered around the Primate of Mexico, the Archbishop of Mexico City, make up our ranks. With this being the case, the Liga Nacional Defensora de la Libertad Religiosa, our de-facto ruling body, in light of our recent victory, has called an emergency meeting to discuss the future of the Mexican government.\n\nDue to the impromptu nature of the LNDLR's meeting, not all important figures from the War could make it, but a quorum had been reached, and the meeting was able to go ahead as planned. Fairly quickly, it become obvious that two factions would come to dominate, namely those in favor of restoring the Republic under the leadership of the Partido Acción Nacional, and those in favor of creating an Organic society in line with Integralist principles. Those in favor of restoring the Republic, including General Gorostieta, believe that the cause of Mexico's ills lay not with the Republic but the poisonous leftist thought that overtook it. Proclaiming democracy to be the greatest freedom, these Republicans wish to elevate and protect the Church, but within a democratic framework. Opposed to them, the Integralists seek to completely dismantle the existing governmental structure and bring forth a truly Catholic, Integral and Organic state. Although they are internally divided between Monarchist and Republican factions but united in propose, the Integralists represent the most extreme end of the Cristero Movement. As the voting ends and the ballots are tallied, it is clear that..."

Suffering from failing health and mental deterioration after the death of his beloved wife Natalia in 1927, Calles has been in a slow, steady decline for over a decade - a decline only accelerated by the rigors of statecraft. As an illustrious state funeral is planned for the father of the Maximato, a power struggle has broken out within the PNR as his closest advisors all jockey with each other to see who shall succeed their fallen leader. Among the clawing and competing masses within the Partido Nacional Revolucionario, three names have risen to the top, with each standing a solid chance at succeeding Calles as the next leader of Mexico - Lázaro Cárdenas, Emilio Portes Gil, and Manuel Perez Treviño. \n\nThe heart of the competition lies between the Revisionist Emilio Portes Gil and the Calles-loyalist Manuel Perez Treviño. Gil seeks to reduce the powers of the President while both expanding the power of the national senate and repealing the harshest of Calles’ old reforms, bringing Mexico under the collective rulership of the PNR behind his presidential facade. In opposition to him, Treviño seeks to uphold the ideals of the Maximato as Calles left them, upholding his reforms while further weakening the non-executive branches of government and uplifting Calles as Mexico’s national father and greatest martyr. \n\nIn stark contrast to both of them, Lázaro Cárdenas stands as the most distinct of the three - a true dark horse despite his close relationship with the late Calles. Disavowing the tyranny his former friend succumbed to, Cárdenas calls for the complete dissolution of the Maximato and of the PNR-dominated congress so that new emergency elections can be held to bring pure democracy back to Mexico. With these three titans of the Mexican Far-Left competing, it truly is any man’s game, but only one can rise to become the true heir to Calles."

Cities throughout Mexico have come to have murals painted on public buildings while prominent public sqaures are filled with statues and paintings in a similar vein. The Murals cover numerous topics mixing social and political messages with Mexican nationalism and cultural exceptionalism or revivalism, and now The 'Big Three' that are seen as the leaders of the movement - Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros - stand as the most prominent cultural figures of our modern age.

Toledano’s opponents have denounced this move as a naked power grab. By undercutting these delegates Toledano is fabricating a reason to have them removed. When they are replaced, they warn, it will be with Toledano loyalists who will give the country and the Revolution away to the aspiring dictator. These alarmists however are few in number and are not taken seriously. Toledano has been a loyal agent of the Revolution since its beginning, there is no way he has been faking it. Is he?"

To a still very religious country this has been met with worried glares. The Church has also traditionally been a political force as well as a social one in Mexico as well. By striking at it now Toledano can send it reeling just long enough to secure total power for himself, at least according to his detractors. To Toledano’s supporters the Church had this coming for a long time. As a traditionally conservative organization they continued existence in a progressive and Revolutionary state like Syndicalist Mexico was a relic of an era long past.

He then announced the replacements for the Staff, a cabal of Generals who have shown fanatical loyalty to Toledano in the past. This move has shocked the many, but none more so than the Army. Having watched Toledano’s creeping authoritarianism with unease, many feel this is a step too far. After the announcement reports of insubordination and conspiracy in the Army sprouted up like weeds.

Some reports say he was rounded up and shot in the street by the military while others maintain he has escaped to Sonora and gone into hiding. What is known for sure though is he is no longer in control of Mexico. The coup plotters, a cabal of military officers and political leaders, have maintained they will hand power back to the rightful government led by Fidel Velasques and the PPS.

He has declared that enemies to the Revolution are everywhere and as such a state of emergency must be maintained “for the foreseeable future”. The State of Emergency gives Toledano near dictatorial powers in Mexico and, in a Constitutional loophole, can only be revoked by the President. While some in the military and the Congress have lodged vigorous and ominous protests, their options to oppose Toledano are limited. By and large however this declaration has been met with sad resignation by the people. Tired of war and instability, few are willing to rise against “The Comandante” as Toledano has come to be called. Toledano for his part now has unfettered and unlimited power in the state. With all the levers of power in his hands he can do whatever he likes and he has sworn he will drag Mexico into the future if he must, kicking and screaming all the way."

They are the Alianza Antisocialista - a loose coalition of Synarchists, Integralists, Corporatists, and other far-right groups banded together with their shared hatred of Socialism despite their diverse array of members - and the Liga Democrática - a diverse camp of various non-Socialist democratic and republican elements that have resisted the Red Tide since the Revolution began. Allying with either group would certainly beholden us to some of their views and ideas, but both have proven their effectiveness in combating the Socialist menace, so some compromise might still be worth their talents. However, despite their ferocity and usefulness, there have been rumors that should we cooperate with these groups, some of the more zealous amongst them may attempt their own seizure of power.

The largest group of these detractors are within ARM, or Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista. More commonly known as the Camisas Doradas, or ‘Gold Shirts’, ARM is a reactionary paramilitary-turned-political party headed by Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco and Roque González Garza - of no relation to General Pablo González Garza.

With local police forces and national guard being overwhelmed, and with treachery within the ranks of the main army now all too common, it would seem that ARM has a solid chance at seizing the city. \n\nShould ARM take the capitol, then soon all of Mexico will too fall to the ambitions of Garza and Carrasco.

The two main camps left within the clique are the Integralists of PIN - Partido Integralista Nacional - led by José Vasconcelos Calderón and Salvador Abascal, and the Synarchists of UNS - Unión Nacional Sinarquista - led by José Antonio Urquiza, and they compete for influence daily. The Sinarquistas are devoutly Catholic, viscously anti-democratic, and rabidly nationalistic, favoring national syndicalist, populist, and mixed economics, while the Integralistas are Catholics as well, and largely, but not exclusively, monarchists pushing for a decentralized, ‘organic’ Mexico similar to the Spanish and Portuguese Integralist movements.

For years, José Vasconcelos Calderón has led PIN without fail, and thanks to his leadership, an Integralist Mexico has been born. However, some have come to doubt this aging hero’s ability to command the nation in this turbulent time, for the current world stage requires each nation to have an almost mercurial flexibility and adaptability to survive - something this old dog set in his ways may not be capable of. Wanting to push Vasconcelos into an early, but still respected, retirement, this clique of doubters has found a possible replacement in Vasconcelos’ protege Salvador Abascal, whose name has been floated as a suitable heir to Vasconcelos’ vision.

Following more mainline corporatist, nationalist, and other contemporary third position principles, Garza is seen as the moderate within ARM to many. On the other hand, Nicolás Carrasco is the far more radical of the two, being even more nationalist and ardently anti-Christian while espousing revivalist ideas about Mexico’s pre-colonial past.

Given her illustrious heritage, she is quite famously the granddaughter of Salvador de Itúrbide (himself grandson of our first emperor Agustín and an adopted son of our second monarch Maximilian I). Doña María would be most appreciated by the traditional Catholics and conservative politicians within our government, and would put us on good relations with the various European powers still beholden to monarchical formalities, while also serving as an easy puppet due to her soft and pious nature and desire to stay out of politics. Alternatively, a 'nativist' clique has emerged, supporting the claims of Don Luis Moctezmua-Marcilla de Teruel y Gómez de Arteche - current holder of the Spanish title of Duke of Moctezuma - a true blood descendent of the last Aztec emperor Moctezuma II. Don Luis holds great sympathies with the Carlists and Integralist ideas, but is not dedicated to them in any way, preferring to rule as a social conservative and authoritarian monarch. Finally, a third clique has arisen that harkens back to the Porfiriato - the era of Porfirio Díaz’s rule - and as such have risen Porfirio Diaz Jr - nicknamed ‘Porfirito’ by his late father - as a candidate representing a new and purely Mexican line. The young Díaz is expected to emulate the legacy of his father as a dictatorial conservative Liberal and Mexican nationalist.

Forming around the Partido Revolucionario de Unificación Nacional, or PRUN, this regime would still fully be beholden to the whims and will of Garza, but would do so behind a thick facade or shackled republicanism and false democracy. Alternatively, General [MEX.GetLeader] could instead rule with an iron fist, continuing the junta and consolidating it into a full stratocratic regime. Regardless, only Garza now controlled the destiny of Mexico and its people, and now it was up to [MEX.GetLeader] once again to determine the direction of the nation."
mexico.361.a:0 "Only total military rule can save Mexico now!"
mexico.361.b:0 "Allow a shackled civilian government to form behind PRUN."

mexico.46.t:0 "Garza's Speech"
mexico.46.d:0 "As the sweltering sun began to peek over the caps of the Sierra Madre in the distance and as the lively streets of Mexico City stirred and woke on this cool morning, the heart of the capitol was electrified to life as General Pablo González Garza began his long-awaited speech. Standing atop the front steps of the Palacio Nacional, Garza looked out at the crowd filling the Plaza del Zócalo - the main square of Mexico City continuously in use since the time of the Aztec and Mexica - and began to exclaim his future plans for the nation to the wider public. As a new sun of a new day dawned over the capitol, Garza exclaimed that a new dawn was rising for all of Mexico as a whole, heralding a new age for our war-torn yet stalwart state, and met with cheers and chants of support from the growing mass of citizens that stood before him. \n\nHowever, not all in the crowd were so ecstatic over Garza’s energizing rhetoric, for the crowd concealed a dark plot that was about to unfold. As Garza continued to gesticulate and posture, an armed and masked agent slowly made his way to the front of the crowd, and with Garza’s retinue of bodyguards all distracted and enthralled by Garza’s magnetic words, the hooded figure was able to get uncomfortably close to Garza’s lectern. With Garza reaching the climax of his prepared speech, the crowd was whipped up into a frenzy, and in that rising moment of celebration, hope, and the lively energy of life, a thundering shot rang out, immediately killing any jubilation and replacing it with sheer terror. Drawing first silence then screaming horror from the crowd, the assassin’s work was done, and as Garza collapsed, the masked figure fled as some of Garza’s guards followed in pursuit. With attendants rushing to Garza’s aid and with many already fearing the worst, the future of Mexico has once again been gambled away on an assassin’s bullet."
mexico.46.a:0 "The round struck an artery, and Garza bled out on the stage."
mexico.46.b:0 "The round misses anything vital, and Garza is expected to pull through."

mexico.460.t:0 "Replacing Our National Father"
mexico.460.d:0 "General and national savior Pablo González Garza has been shot dead during his long-awaited address to the nation, and now all of Mexico recoils in horror we are once again cast into the fires of the unknown. With Garza’s tragic death at the hand of this murderer, the reins of power have once again been left idle after yet another assassin leaves their mark on our history. In the wake of this chaotic turn of events, a new successor must be quickly chosen to take Garza’s place, for Mexico needs a strongman to guide it now more than ever! \n\nBefore our administration lies two possible heirs to Garza’s position: Félix Díaz and Juan Barragán - both proven loyalists to Garza during his life, and now dedicated heralds for the late hero’s vision. Félix Díaz is more ‘old-school’, following the ideals of the infamous Porfirio Díaz and the Porfiriato as a champion of liberal-conservative authoritarianism. Opposing him, Juan Barragán is far more of a populist authoritarian, and notably is a direct descendent to the House of Moctezuma. Regardless, of who is chosen, allies of Garza can have some peace of mind, for both Díaz and Barragán pay great lip-service to the late hero of Mexico, and both are expected to largely follow Garza’s plans for the nation, with their own small flair added to the mix. Now all that is left to do is choose who shall replace our fallen leader."
mexico.460.a:0 "Félix Díaz shall take Garza’s place and lead Mexico."
mexico.460.b:0 "Juan Barragán will steer the nation in Garza’s stead."

mexico.461.t:0 "Restore the Monarchy?"
mexico.461.d:0 "With the death of Generalissimo Pablo Garza, our nation has been cast adrift without direction yet again as two general factions vie for influence. Though varied themselves, these two camps each seek to pull Mexico in a new direction - one free from the horrors and failures of the Revolution. \n\nThe first camp, the more factionalized of the two, consists of different monarchists of all different types, all pushing for their own form of a new imperial system with their own candidate as the new Monarch. If they were to win, there are three main candidates who could sit on the throne, most obvious of which is María Josepha Sophia de Iturbide. Descendent of Maximillian and a pious Catholic herself, María Josepha would make the perfect constitutional monarch for this new Mexico, or so her supporters claim. Rivaling her loyalists are the nativist supporters of the Duke of Tultengo Don Luis Moctezuma, who is the current ruler of the noble House of Moctezuma and blood-relative to perhaps the greatest Aztec emperor. They support a benevolent though authoritarian monarchy under Don Luis that revives some of the less barbaric policies of the First Empire of Mexico - the Aztec’s Triple Alliance. Finally, seeking to slide past both of these established nobles, the new House of Diaz seeks to establish a brand new Mexican monarchy based on modern Mexican nationalism and the glories of the Porfiriato. Headed by the son of the great Porfirio Diaz, Porfirio Jr. picked up monarchist tendencies during his frequent travels to the Kaiserreich visit the tomb of his father and German nobles, and now this young hero of Mexico’s armed forces seeks to follow in his late father’s footsteps in order to usher in a new Mexican golden age. \n\nFar more united than their monarchist counterparts, the Republican faction may have their disagreements as to how a new Mexican republic shall look, but they have largely maintained a unified front in order to combat the elitist influence of the monarchists. Only one faction can win out however, so who shall rise to lead Mexico into this new age once again as Garza is laid to rest?"
mexico.461.a:0 "A new Mexican monarchy shall rise from the pages of history!"
mexico.461.b:0 "Monarchism has only failed Mexico time and time again. We march towards Republicanism!"

mexico.462.t:0 "A Choice of Direction"
mexico.462.d:0 "With the nation in the palm of his hand, General Garza alone was to decide the destiny of this nation and the fate of the Mexican people. Before him lay two paths forward on how to rule Mexico in these new and uncertain times. Garza could either embrace the glories of the past, pulling on the image and rhetoric of the great Liberal dictator Porfirio Díaz, or he could blaze his own path forwards, creating a military junta under his conservative iron fist. So, which way Mexican man?"
mexico.462.a:0 "Create a new military junta under Generalissimo Garza!"
mexico.462.b:0 "Look to past glories to build a new Porfiriato under General Garza!"

mexico.61.t:0 "The New Constitution"
mexico.61.d:0 "In Mexico City today a new constitution was unveiled today. The Constitution of [GetYear] is rather similar to the 1917 Constitution, though it is also different in a number of ways. Notably it does not contain the same anti-clericalism, land reform and other radical parts that made up the 1917 constitution. It is regarded as a more moderate, more democratic constitution. While there is great fanfare in Mexico City, in a number of rural towns the new constitution was met with obvious disdain."
mexico.61.a:0 "A new day rises in Mexico."

mexico.62.t:0 "The Legacy of the Revolution"
mexico.62.d:0 "The legacy of the Mexican Revolution has been something that has been up for debate within the Mexican Congress. Some regard the whole revolution as terrible and we should condemn it as a backwards step. Others wish though that we should condemn just the radicals like Zapata and Villa for destroying Mexico. What shall be decided?"
mexico.62.a:0 "Condemn just Zapata and other Radicals."
mexico.62.b:0 "Condemn the whole revolution."

mexico.63.t:0 "Anti-Native Law"
mexico.63.d:0 "A law has been proposed that would repeal the various laws that Zapata passed for the indigenous Mexicans. The law has a great deal of support from those in power among the right wing that regard the laws as just another policy that Zapata did to destroy Mexico. However, this naturally will not please the various indigenous Mexicans, notably the Maya and their allies in the Yucatan."
mexico.63.a:0 "Pass the law."
mexico.63.b:0 "Don't pass the law."

mexico.6301.t:0 "A Desert Rat is Found"
mexico.6301.d:0 "Hiding out in the badlands of Mexico’s Sonoran Desert, squatting in a rocky outcropping too small to be called a real cave, Mexico’s most hated man, Plutarco Calles, sat alone with his thoughts. On the run for weeks after being connected to the attempt on Zapata’s life, Calles has bounced from town to town, village to village, wasteland to wasteland, all to escape the long arm of the Law that was running him down like a dog. \n\nAwake for 37 hours straight and concentrated on starting a fire, Calles could almost be forgiven for not hearing the riders approach. Before he could even turn his head to see who fired the shot, the left side of his skull burst into a crimson pulpy mist before he slumped to the ground and let out his last, gurgling breath. \n\nThe riders that had shot him were local police, out looking for highwaymen and bandits on the trails, never expecting to come across the most wanted man in Mexico and not even knowing who they had shot until walking up to inspect the corpse. Tying up what was left of Calles’ body and throwing it over the back of one of their horses, the police quickly rode off to the nearest town in order to phone the capital of the tremendous news."
mexico.6301.a:0 "A fitting end for such a scoundrel."

mexico.6302.t:0 "Canabal Cuts off Junta Forces in Tabasco"
mexico.6302.d:0 "Lording over the state he once was governor in and where he ruled as a ‘Socialist Tyrant’ as noted by locals, General Canabal has proclaimed his opposition to the ruling regime in Mexico city, refusing to allow Junta forces through and into the Yucatan peninsula beyond. The loss of control of this vital chokepoint has cut off the bulk of our Junta’s forces from the Yucatan Peninsula, putting our control over the whole region in jeopardy. While Canabal's position as Governor can only last so long before he is dislodged by Junta forces, his resistance has rendered us powerless in the Yucatan peninsula as forces opposing us in all forms consolidate control over the vast region. Already riots and protests against the government have exploded through Mérida, and the vast native populace of the Peninsula, who has been nominally loyal to President Zapata have been steadfast in opposing the forces of the Junta. While this opposition is officially non-violent, an increase in violence is expected within the position as Yucatan teeters on the verge of lawlessness."
mexico.6302.a:0 "Our Control over Yucatan slips further."

mexico.6303.t:0 "Gold Shirts Clash with Maya Militias in Yucatan"
mexico.6303.d:0 "In a maelstrom of chaos and bloodshed, Maya militias in the Yucatan have reportedly gotten into numerous bloody clashes with local Gold Shirts under the direction of the Aztec-Inspired Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco. This ironic revival of an ancient rivalry between the Mayans and Aztecs has further plunged the Yucatan peninsula into fighting and bloodshed, as Mayan militants under the once disgraced Francisco May Pech officially denounce the central government in Mexico city. As the violence continues to spread, chaos and mayhem have followed suit as the southern tip of Mexico further plunges into chaos."
mexico.6303.a:0 "Absolute pandemonium!"

mexico.6304.t:0 "Salvador Alvarado Refuses to Recognize the Central Government"
mexico.6304.d:0 "In a move half-shocking and half completely expected, General Salvador Alvarado - Socialist Caudillo and Governor of Yucatan - has publicly and officially refused to follow the will of the federal government in Mexico City. Citing decades if not centuries of Mexican oppression and cultural erosion against the native Yucatecos, Alvarado has gone just shy of declaring full independence. With tensions running high, all in the nation expect war with these southern firebrands to break out soon."
mexico.6304.a:0 "Someone just shoot that traitor already!"

mexico.64.t:0 "The Yucatan Rebellion"
mexico.64.d:0 "Finally breaking the last seal that held back total mayhem, General Alvarado has declared an independent Yucatecos Republic in the Yucatan Peninsula, breaking free from our will and revolting against our government. Citing previous conflicts such as the Cruzob Revolts and the Caste War, the people of the Yucatan are done with being stuck under the Mexican boot, and now shall fight for their right to rule themselves. With shots already being fired and with blood already being spilled, there is no stopping this war now as Mexico suffers yet another secessionist crisis."
mexico.64.a:0 "We shall destroy these traitors! To arms!"
mexico.64.b:0 "Libertad o Muerte! (Play as Yucatan)"

mexico.640.t:0 "Mexican Troops on the Move"
mexico.640.d:0 "Though a war was declared when our state broke free from Mexico City, there has not been any serious mobilization or conflict, with only small skirmishes over the border or between recon teams being common. However, all of that shall soon change, for our intel indicates that the Mexicans are now mobilizing, preparing to amass troops at the border in order to strike us down in one fell swoop. We must prepare our defenses and ready the men, for this revolution is finally about to truly begin."
mexico.640.a:0 "Libertad o Muerte!"

mexico.65.t:0 "Mexico is Unable to Pacify the Yucatan"
mexico.65.d:0 "While [MEX.GetLeader] promised to defeat the Rebellious Yucatan in less than year, it is clear by now that is no longer the case. The fact that our armies have been driven back and ceasefire is in place, means that [MEX.GetLeader] must watch his back as various rivals might very well move to replace him."
mexico.65.a:0 "We must watch our backs."

mexico.66.t:0 "Yucatan Manages to Survive"
mexico.66.d:0 "We have managed to drive out the Mexicans and for the first time, we are now a free and independent republic. Now that the war is over, we can focus on rebuilding the country, of course we must never let our guard down against the Mexicans that we will seek to take our land."
mexico.66.a:0 "Viva Yucatan!"

mexico.67.t:0 "The Yucatan is Pacified"
mexico.67.d:0 "The traitors and rebels in the Yucatan have been put down and the region has been pacified. The region will never again be a source of trouble for Mexico."
mexico.67.a:0 "Viva Mexico."

mexico.68.t:0 "Rejoin Mexico?"
mexico.68.d:0 "Though we have fought hard to preserve our independence, that does not seem to be a realistic option now as the war drags on and the Mexicans refuse to recognize our total independence. Some have suggested that we should broker a deal with the Mexicans, asking for amnesty and autonomy in exchange for peace. With the war taking its toll on their side as well, they are likely to accept, so all that is left to do is to decide what we should do."
mexico.68.a:0 "Let us rejoin Mexico, for it is our only option. (Tag Switch to MEX)"
mexico.68.b:0 "Let us continue the fight for Independence! Libertad o Muerte!"

mexico.69.t:0 "The Yucatan Ends their Rebellion"
mexico.69.d:0 "Seeing the writing on the wall, the Yucatecos rebels have finally sued for peace, offering autonomy and amnesty for full annexation. We of course have graciously accepted, now wishing to waste more Mexican lives in war we have already won, and not wanting to damage our newly returned property as well. Now, let us move on from this dreadful war for the good of all Mexicans."
mexico.69.a:0 "Viva Mexico!"

mexico.70.t:0 "The Yucatan Fights On"
mexico.70.d:0 "Spitting in our faces, the Yucatecos guerillas have ignored or rejected every call for surrender we have put forward, refusing to give up the fight for their peninsula. Their stubborness has left us with two options - either continue the war and waste more Mexican lives for a useless strip of jungle, or recognize their right to independence and back out of the war to focus on greater ambitions. What shall we do?"
mexico.70.a:0 "They shall be destroyed."
mexico.70.b:0 "Accept Yucatan's independence."

mexico.700.t:0 "Mexico City Falls to the Yucatan"
mexico.700.d:0 "In a stunning display of military ineptitude that borders on the comical, the Mexican armed forces have been beaten time and time again by the infinitely smaller Yucatecos guerilla force. Being pushed all the way back to Mexico City itself, this has been one of the greatest military humiliations, or underdog victories, in recent history, and now they are at our mercy. We can either restore Socialism in Mexico under President Alvarado, or we can retreat back to our newly independent Yucatan while dissolving the Mexican government and leaving the nation to completely collapse upon itself. Whatever we decide to do, the fate of all Mexico now lies within our hands."
mexico.700.a:0 "Restore Socialism in Mexico with Alvarado at its helm!"
mexico.700.b:0 "Dissolve the Mexican Government and leave the nation to the wolves!"

mexico.701.t:0 "Regaining Control of the State"
mexico.701.d:0 "With our stunning and humiliating loss against the Yucatan, Mexico has now fallen into chaos as the government is dissolved and the entire societal apparatus collapses. Mexico teeters on the verge of complete anarchy and lawlessness, but there is still hope. A small group of committed Socialists have banded together in order to save the dying government, and now have attempted to proclaim a new Mexican government entirely separate from the sins of the past. However, despite their good intentions, it may already be too late."
mexico.701.a:0 "Socialists wrestle control of Mexico once more."

mexico.702.d:0 "Shock. Horror. Calamity and oh the humanity, Mexico has fallen. Shattered by outside forces, humiliated, and left to rot and die like a carcass left in the Sonoran sun for the buzzards, our Mexican state ceases to exist. In its place, dozens of warlord cliques and opportunistic states of all shades have risen to try and take up the mantle of a new Mexico or to carve out their own identity and destiny free of past sins and failures. Awash with violence, suffering, and chaotic political power-grabs, Mexico is now a sundered land, alien to even its most intimate natives."

mexico.108.d:0 "With the foundation of our Anti-Socialist state now decided upon by the Integralist and Synarchist members of our coalition, the time has come to answer the final and largest question that has loomed over all of our heads. With the Integralists clamoring for a monarchy as the larger Synarchist clique instead push for a nationalist republic, our coalition has threatened to fracture numerous times through this strenuous interim period, but luckily some compromises have been made in order to appease the larger group. The two choices that lie before us as an Imperial-style Republic dominated by the Synarchists with some vague promises to crown a monarch ‘eventually’, or a strong Monarchy pushed by the Integralists with an accompanying parliament to support the monarch. Regardless of what we choose, the fates of the Synarchist and Integralists are bound together, so now we just have to make our final decision for the good of the whole AAS."

One such name that has invited some attention was that of General Pablo Garza, hero of the Counter-Revolution and slayer of the Zapata government, who has been granted the title of Archduke of Oaxaca to much fanfare. Though there was some pushback, most see this as a natural choice, for Garza is one of the greatest strongmen in modern Mexican history.

mexico.1102.d:0 "Today, the Archdiocese of Mexico announced with great remorse that Pascual Díaz Barreto, Archbishop of Mexico since 1929, has passed away from this mortal life. Dying of colitis in the dark reaches of the night, the Archbishop's seat now lies vacant, and with his passing, Auxiliary Bishop Maximino Ruiz y Flores has taken over administrative duties, until the Holy See in Rome declares a replacement for Archbishop. In his time as Archbishop, Barreto was perhaps one of the most vocal opponents to Zapata's government, due to his apparent Socialism and a perceived  lack of regard for the Church. It should come as no surprise then that he threatened in late 1935 to excommunicate Zapata and all in government if they failed to disavow Socialism, although this never materialized. Along with his opposition to the government, under the Archbishop the Church turned a blind eye to the ASA and their various actions against the Republic. While never outwardly supporting them, Barreto also never said anything against the ASA and on a few occasions it seems he actively encouraged members of the Church to join the paramiltary.\n\nReactions to the death of the Archbishop have been meet with almost as many mixed reactions as there are people in Mexico. Those to the Left and even a few in the center of the political sphere have almost celebrated his death, decrying his involvement with the ASA as paramount to treason. Those to the Many to the Right have come out of the woodwork to describe their deep sadness at the loss of one of Mexico's most ardent anti-Socialist public figures. At the same time, others in the Right have joined the Leftists in celebrating the death of a man who's Church keeps Mexico in the shackles of faith.  Regardless, with his passing a large hole has been opened within the Hierarchy of the Mexican Church, a hole that only the Successor of Saint Peter himself can fill."

Exactly why the Bishop of Rome would pick such a man as he to be the next Archbishop will ultimately remain only for the Pope and God to know, but it is not hard to guess why. Martínez, especially for a Man of the Cloth, is outspoken in his support for the LD, and even to a minor exact the Revolutionary Democracy that came to dominate Mexico. With the Pontifex Maximus's own support for such governments himself, it comes as no surprise as to why Martínez would be chosen.

mexico.114.t:0 "Defining the Powers of the Primate"
mexico.114.d:0 "With the Government granting His Grace, the Archbishop of Mexico, the title of 'Primate,' officially making him the supreme authority in Mexico, many are beginning to debate just what that actually means. While yes, as the supreme authority in the land would technically mean that the Primate could make political decisions binding on the entirety of the country, in effect this has yet to happen. Indeed, as of now, the newly minted Primate has done nothing but rubber stamp the various decrees and laws of the Synarchointegralist government, leading many to wonder if more clarity on just what the Archbishop's title actually means for the day to day running of the country.\n\nTo that effect, the President and the Archbishop himself have called together the minds of the movement to fully clarify this title. As was to be expected, the movement has split in twain over this issue. All are in agreement that officially, the Primate is to be the head of Mexico, but beyond that all disagreement lies. A majority at the meeting, seemingly including even the Archbishop, believe that the title should stop at Head of State, and should hold no real temporal authority. While somewhat of a convolved scheme, in effect this faction wishes to see the Primate as something of a Figurehead Monarch, such as the Monarch of Great Britain before the Syndicalist Revolution. In opposition to these 'Figureheadists' are those who wish to see the Primate be granted actual supreme authority. Very much in the minority, those in the 'Ultramontanist' faction wish to grant the Primate the finally word in all decisions, and unchecked power in political matters. Declaring that the Church is above the state already, they view granting the Primate true Temporal Authority to be a logical conclusion. Regardless, the President must make his choice before confusion over takes Mexico."

mexico.114.b:0 "The Primate is our figurehead, and nothing more."

mexico.115.t:0 "Archbishop Martínez's 'Tendencies'"
mexico.115.d:0 "Since assuming the title of Primate, and since being granted ultimate power within Mexico, His Excellency Luis María Martínez has become more and more vocal in his opposition to Synarchointegralist rule. Starting first as off-the-cuff comments during the Holy Mass, has now turned into whole sermons solely about the glory of democracy and liberty, in direct contrast to the single party rule of our state. While the Primate is well with in his rights to do this, he is our Temporal Head after-all, it is becoming something of a bother. While most knew he was against our state, a select few believe that the Primate may be gearing up for an attempt to restore democracy, and think that the President should step in while he still can and 'remind' the Primate who put him in power in the first place. While such an action would fly in the face of the established order, and would be a direct violation of State-Church relations, many fear we may not have another chance."
mexico.115.a:0 "The Primate is well within his rights to make these comments."
mexico.115.b:0 "Arrange a private meeting with 'His Excellency' to end this, once and for all."

mexico.116.t:0 "A Democratic Surge"
mexico.116.d:0 "Much to the shock of the leadership of our government, it would seem that Archbishop Martínez's comments have begun resonating with the people of Mexico. Much as those few members of government feared, it would appear that the Archbishop may truly be plotting a coup against our righteous control over the republic. In a near conformation of this suspicion, Primate Martínez has been seen meeting with leaders of the nigh defunct Liga Democractia, which had nearly reached nonexistence before the Primate's rise. With tensions between the government and the Primate brewing to an unheard level, it seems that the clock is ticking before the Primate makes his move, and it may be our last chance to put the Archbishop in his place before we lose everything we have fought to build. "

mexico.116.b:0 "Legal mandates be damned! Put the Archbishop in his place!"

mexico.117.t:0 "The Torch of Liberty Burns Once More"
mexico.117.d:0 "In a move fully expected with the political gambling over the pat few weeks, His Excellency, the Primate of Mexico, Luis María Martínez, has exercised his vast political authority and has dismissed the Synarchointegralist government. Along with this great dismissal, he has appointed the Liga Democractia to led a provisional government, until free elections can be safely held. Thus with one swift stroke, Synarchointegralist rule has ended, and democracy has been restored. However, despite this glorious triumph for Liberty, there remains one question to be answered. That question of course being the position of Primate itself. While democracy itself was saved by the Primate, and indeed the Primate himself is a vocal adhered to the ideals of democratic republicanism, there is no guartentee that the next Primate will feel the same. Thus, a large group within the LD has approached the Archbishop, and asked him to peacefully hand over his temporal authority, allowing the reformation of a true Republic. While the Primate would normally gladly follow through with this, another group approached him and asked him to maintain his authority, if not in a less powerful manner. Believing that a uniting, unpolitical, figurehead to be the key to keeping Mexico from falling apart once more, they wish to maintain the Primate as something of a Constitutional Monarch. Finally, the thought to simply maintain his vast powers has popped into the Archbishop's head more than once, after all who better to safeguard democracy than the man who restored it? Regardless, it falls to the Primate to make this decision, and the Primate alone."
mexico.117.a:0 "The Primate elects to rule as a Constitutional 'Monarch'."

Immigrating to Mexico at the age of 17 with his brother and uncle, Nonaka settled in Oaxaca, working on a coffee plantation before tiring from the harsh work and traveling briefly to the United States. Upon his return, he settled in the northern state of Chihuahua, being taken in by a local family who would eventually adopt him, baptizing him with the name José Genaro Kingo Nonaka before he took on training as a nurse in a local hospital. \n\nLater, while visiting a fellow Japanese immigrant in 1911, Nonaka became stranded and cut-off from any possibility of returning home quickly as the Battle of Casa Grandes broke out. Caught in the middle of the hellstorm, Nonaka jumped into action, tending to the wounded and eventually saving the life of the famed Francisco Madero after he was shot in the hand. Subsequently recruited into Madero’s army, Nonaka became a war hero as he worked with titans like Pancho Villa as an army doctor throughout the conflict before settling into his own medical practice as the Chief Nurse of the Ciudad Juárez Civil Hospital, even serving as a principal founder of the Instituto Nacional de Cardiología. \n\nA lover of photography as well, Nonaka has been recently hailed as a fine artist for his archival photos of the Revolution and rapidly developing locales such as Tijuana on top of his numerous military and medical accolades. Even settling down with a fine Mexican wife named Petra Garcia Ortega who served alongside him as a nurse and having five children all their own, Nonaka has proven to be one of the archetypal examples of a successful and patriotic Mexican immigrant. Let us hope that our own homegrown samurai protects Mexico for years to come."

The Conference in Mexico City, originally organized by the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista, was conceived as a means to end the rivalry between Mexico's Nationalist political strata. Such an end was mediated by the paramilitary militia of the Camisas Doradas - the Gold Shirts - who proceeded to storm the building with automatic weapons, killing anyone and everyone in sight. The Synarchists, Integralists, Republicans, and the old Royal Family themselves, personally invited by the Integralists, were all in attendance, and none were spared from the cruelty of the Gold Shirt's assault as they gunned down anyone they perceived as a potential enemy of the state. \n\nIn the wake of this atrocity, the nation has been placed under the control of a temporary council led by the Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista, assuming full control of the apparatus of state under a new, nationalist government. Now, with Mexico in the palm of their hands, these firebrands are hellbent on swiftly and permanently eliminating all threats to the new revolutionary state in Mexico, both within and without."

With their hardline, Right-wing rhetoric, fanatical Anti-Catholic doctrine, and their controversial views of "Hispanidad", many nations around the world have voiced their outrage, with no one voicing their displeasure more loudly than the Austrian Empire, whose extended family among the Mexican royalty, the Iturbides, were among those slain in the Gold Shirt's revolution."

From the Clergy to the Nunnery to simple Church volunteers, the Christian faithful of Mexico have found themselves targets of the Gold Shirt's wrath, as anyone found is promptly lined up against the nearest wall and gunned down if they aren’t shot as they try to flee first. Going even further, the ARM has begun to target various missions and churches across metropolitan Mexico, burning each and every single house of worship to the ground. \n\nAs the death tolls rises and the fires rage across Mexico's inner cities, it is clear that the Gold Shirt's anti-clerical crusade is only just beginning, with the only real exception to these recent pogroms being the numerous spread-out Catholic missions that dot the rural countryside, which have been largely ignored due to their relative isolation from Mexican society, at least for now.

Not only willing to face the sun-blasted deserts, the desperate masses to the South have begun braving the thick jungles of Southern Mexico and Central America rather than face the wrath of the Gold Shirts, with refugees and partisans alike now shielding themselves beneath the vast jungle canopy west of the border to Guatemala. \n\nWhile hunting down these shirkers and dissenters has become troublesome out in the fringes of the countryside, the interim government is confident this rabble will be brought into line and subsequently terminated, no matter how long it takes."

As the count ended, the bodies of all of the principle leadership of both the Integralists and Synarchists are accounted for, as are the bodies of the royalist pretenders to the Second Mexican Empire, being the Lady Maria Josepha and her eldest daughter, Maria Anna. However, the status of Maria Josepha's youngest daughter, the Lady Maria Gizela, remains perplexingly uncertain. Despite a thorough search of the building at the site of the massacre, as well as an equally thorough search throughout Mexico City, the would-be heir to Mexico's imperial throne has seemingly vanished into thin air.

mexico.146.d:0 "While the ultra-nationalist militia of the Camisas Doradas has shown themselves to be incorruptible allies of the revolution, the question of the allegiance of the military to the ARM is far from certain. Most notably, where it pertains to the old guard among the counter-revolutionary army, this dilemma was seemingly sparked by the rumors of impudence and insubordination exhibited by the renowned General Félix Diaz. Himself the nephew of the late, great General Porfirio Diaz - hero of the revolutionary war against Emperor Maximilian, and later, the President of the newly founded Republic of Mexico - it is little wonder that a man like Félix Diaz, like many other generals with a family history of military service, would perhaps become prideful with such a prestigious lineage. His own cousin, Porfirio Díaz Ortega, is similarly proud of his family's service to the Mexican people, and is also said to have voiced his own reservations about the ARM regime in private. This supposed insolence has sparked some outrage among the general officer corps most loyal to the cause of the Gold Shirts, the most vocal among them being Field Marshall Saturnino Cedillo, a long time rival of both the Generals Diaz, decrying their alleged disloyalty as tantamount to treason."

In light of this, the ARM leadership has promoted the august field marshal General Saturnino Cedillo to the position of Chief of the Mexican Army - a position he has sought since the revolution against the Syndicalists - in the hopes of ridding Mexico of this insane and unpredictable new threat. \n\nWhile the exact nature of the Cult and its leadership remains unknown, the implication of treason on the part of the Generals Félix and Porfirio Diaz in aiding the assassins in Colonia Doctores clearly points to a conspiracy within the counter revolutionary army. On the order of the ARM government, General Cedillo has set out with a contingent of the Gold Shirt's Militiamen with the goal of arresting and interrogating the Cousins Diaz to uncover the full extent of the Santa Muerte Plot."

mexico.148.t:0 "Señora de las Sombras"
mexico.148.d:0 "In the shadows of Mexico's great cities, in the vast wildlands of barren deserts and dense jungles, there persists a reverence to a grim and frightening folk legend. One with roots dating back to the age of the Spanish conquest. One that the rural poor of Mexico worship as a goddess. One that goes by a multitude of names: The Skinny Woman, The Bony Lady, The White Sister, The Godmother, Mictēcacihuātl, the Lady of Shadows, and many, many others. But the name that most know her by is that of Mexico's Patron Saint of Death: Santa Muerte. \n\nOnce upon a time, she had been little more than an urban legend, revered only by banditos on the run in the desolate seclusion of Mexico's northern deserts. To hear her name invoked now, however, serves little more than as a means to frighten young children by the campfire with fantastical tales of Mexico's own grim reaper. However, with the situation in the country so desperate, and with so many fleeing the chaos wrought by the Gold Shirt, this has begun to slowly change. As more desperate souls disappear into the wilderness, known to many as the hallowed grounds of Santa Muerte and her faithful, our scouts have begun to report that many, both among refugees and partisan alike, have taken to seeking solace in the bosom of Mexico's Goddess of Death. \n\nIt is possible that the long term psychological damage of the ARM's terror tactics are having an effect on Mexico's oppressed population, driving so many to adhere to the dogma of an otherwise obscure folklore. Although the ARM government has scarcely addressed the slow rise in popularity of the worship of Santa Muerte in the hinterlands, believing it to be little more than frightful superstition, many among the soldiery are growing restless at the notion that the Lady of Death and her followers might pose far more real of a threat than anyone realizes."

mexico.149.d:0 "The issues the ARM government faces in consolidating their hold over Mexico have only continued. Recent council meetings in Mexico City have been stymied by an increasing ideological conflict between the principal members of the ARM's leadership. The root of this inter-party schism stems from the minds of the revolutionary general Roque González Garza and the paramilitary militia leader Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco, with the former having come to represent the so-called ‘Old Guard’ among the ARM. and the latter representing a cabal called the ‘New Guard’. \n\nThis rivalry within the ARM seems to be a manifestation of a long-running series of disagreements between Garza and Carrasco regarding the cultural and societal future of the Mexican people. Carrasco and his New Guard have spoken candidly of creating a Latin-American utopia, culminating in a complete cultural revolution that would serve as a resurrection of the ancient traditions of the Aztecs, even going so far as to reconstitute the Mexica Religion, including many of its archaic and almost barbaric customs, as Mexico's official state religion. Carrasco's apparent vision of Mexico reincarnated as the mythic Aztlān has disturbed a number of those among the ARM as a whole, and many of them have flocked to the side of General Garza and the Old Guard, with Garza himself echoing their concerns, and has instead insisted on maintaining the party line and secular doctrine of the revolution, urging his cohorts not to indulge in delusional fantasy and dogma. It is clear in the arguments between Garza and Carrasco that the ARM is far more dysfunctional than it appears, and with the regime's recent problems in pacifying the countryside, the ARM may find itself vulnerable to yet another counter-revolution."

mexico.150.d:0 "Continuous efforts by our administration to suppress and persecute the remnants of our political enemies have highlighted a crucial flaw in the ARM's powerbase. Since assuming control of the country, almost the entirety of the ARM's political power has been centered around the urban elite of Mexico's metropolitan cities, with the municipal apparatus of Mexico City itself firmly under the control of the ARM and its allies. However, the problem both the Gold Shirt militias and the state military all keep coming back to is in extending our influence beyond the metropolitan center of the country into the mountains, jungles and deserts that surround us. Mexico itself has always been known as rural country to the rest of the world, and with the nation being relatively under-industrialized compared to other nations like the United States, combined with the intense lack of modern roads or rail-lines, any large scale attempt exert our influence outside of the cities has been difficult as communications break down and logistics becomes bogged down by Mexico's historically difficult terrain. \n\nIndeed, these issues plaguing our efforts of consolidation are beginning to mirror other failing states such as the Ottoman Empire. More and more, the hinterlands to the North and South are rapidly becoming a cauldron of instability, with both the military and the militia's failures to bring the countryside to heel now beginning to reflect poorly on the legitimacy of the government. More worryingly, reports have begun to amass of corruption emanating from the military's outposts in these distant hinterlands, only weakening the ARM’s cause even further. Something must be done!"

These brave and disconnected houses of worship have provided shelter and succor to the oppressed and destitute of Mexico, well away from the chaos in the capital, hidden in the shade of the natural barriers of jungle canape and desert mountain ranges of the badlands. But another phenomenon has begun to manifest out in the fringes of the Mexican backwater. \n\nSanta Muerte, the Latin deity of death long since driven underground by the likes of Syndicalists and Republicans alike, has seen a resurgence among the refugees and dissidents in the badlands in a manner that is unprecedented, but perhaps not without reason. With the desolation of Mexican people targeted by the tyranny of the ARM regime, and with such cruel and merciless destruction done against the Latin-Hispanic way of life and tradition, many left stranded in the wilderness and hiding from the Gold Shirts are utterly without hope, nevermind faith, from having had their entire livelihoods decimated by the ARM's ruthless reign. In such tragic circumstances, it is of little wonder that faithful of Mexico, having seen both their faith and their families all but wiped out, would than seek answers, comfort, or perhaps even the promise of revenge, in the grim dogma and dark promises of the Mexico's enigmatic DoÃ±a Bella Sebastiana. \n\nIt is not just the refugees that have gradually come under of the followers of Santa Muerte; many among the deserted soldiery and dissenting soldadera have taken to venerating Santa Muerte and a growing number of brothers and sisters among the clergy and the nunnery have taken to incorporating Santa Muerte and her teachings into their sermons, this strange mixing of the faiths of Mexico's downtrodden is slowly growing in popularity."

One dedicated to the ideals of Hispanic superiority and absolute authority in the state, the party, and the leadership, and there is nothing the revolution in Mexico City is unwilling to do to further that cause. Such ambitions carry a heavy price for the people of Mexico, and from their suffering, a new and shadowy organization has come to the forefront of Mexican politics. \n\nFrom the depths of the jungles and beneath the hills of the great deserts, these proud and fanatical followers of Santa Muerte have proclaimed themselves to be the true protectors of Mexico. Zealous, capable, cunning, and utterly devoid of fear, they are nuns, priests, doctors, farmers, miners, soldiers, soldadera, and more. Men, women, children and all, risen from the ashes, uplifted from carnage wrought by the brutality of the ARM, and all willing and ready to lay down their lives in the name of God, Jesus Christ, and the promise of vengeance against the plague bacilli of Roque and Carrasco. All they do is in the name of the enigmatic La Dama Poderosa, a name given to Santa Muerte, but also one given to the apparent and mysterious leader and prophet of this new latin faith. Some in the badlands call them Los Iluminados, or ‘The Illuminated Ones’, while others compare their strange and ominous beliefs to the old heresies of medieval Spain, calling them ‘Cathars’ for their intense devotion and the inclusion woman priestesses among their faithful. Many others, however, simply know them as the Cult of Santa Muerte, and with the ARM regime so exposed and stretched thin, many in Mexico City anxiously lie in wait, staring out from behind the cracked adobe walls of their haciendas, watching the trees and hills beyond for this new, looming threat."

He has extended an offer of aid in organizing a nationalist rally in Colonia Doctores, extolling the virtues of the revolution and the party as a means to, hopefully, reestablish party legitimacy to the people of Mexico in the wake of the army's recent pacification campaign of the Badlands. While some among the Council grumble at being reminded of their recent failings, none can deny the damage dealt against the ARM's reputation in the recent months. While some among the officer corps still question the validity of Diaz's overtures, with Field Marshal Cedillo - a bitter rival and cousin of Diaz - openly questioning the motives behind Diaz's sudden change of heart. Nonetheless, the recent chaos in the countryside means that a public display of power and solidarity is sorely needed. \n\nThe question that follows now is to whom the responsibility of speaking to the Mexican people falls?

In this reality, combined with the struggle of maintaining stability in the major cities simultaneously, it was only a matter of time before something like this would happen. The matter of Diaz's arrest will have to wait for the time being, for the pressing issue of maintaining control over metropolitan Mexico is of higher priority. If the ARM and the army begin to lose the major cities to the mob, the stability of the government itself might be in jeopardy. \n\nWhile the army would simply prefer to march on the city and end the unrest, the recent attack by Santa Muerte has everyone on edge and the ARM administration fears the Cult might be involved in the chaos in the city, possibly planning a trap for the army. At the same time, however, it was also the site of one of the major battles of the revolution against the Porfiriato, and as a result, the ARM is compelled to save face with the army so that such a monument to the counter-revolution does not potentially fall into the enemy's hands.

Whereas the august, collected voice of the veteran field marshal once spoke with calm conviction, Félix Diaz now spoke with a fiery and indignant rage at the ARM Regime, openly and furiously denouncing the crimes of the Gold Shirts as the second coming of Hernán Cortés, decrying their treatment of the people of Mexico, most especially their systematic killing of Catholics, as tantamount to cultural genocide. At this, the Generalissimo called upon the patriotic warriors of the Counter-Revolutionary army to take up arms against the Camisas Doradas, to expunge the plague bacillus of the ARM, lest they place every man, woman and child of Mexico at the mercy of the firing squad. \n\nAt the end of the broadcast, Diaz implored the people of Mexico, with the fire and passion the old Porfiriato were known for, to remember their history, to remember their heritage and their dignity in the face of ungodly tyranny, and finally, and most disturbingly of all, he called on the men and women of Mexico to defend their homeland in the name of family, country, God......and the Empress.

The uprising in Veracruz is the most pressing issue at the moment in their eyes and requires immediate concern. \n\nThe present strategy placed forward to Cedillo and the General Staff is a decisive and swift put down of the malcontents downtown. This would resemble a direct march into the city, forcing a speedy surrender and dealing out harsh punishment to those who resist. Liking the plan, the government is adamant that, at this stage, violent reconciliation in the face of the rebel threat is of utmost importance for the preservation of the Mexican State, no matter what the rabble might think. Field Marshal Cedillo is not so convinced of this notion though. The stern-faced Chief of the Army is of the belief that Santa Muerte has set a trap for the army amidst the chaos in the streets, and believes that a more methodical, meticulous encirclement of Veracruz would be the best method of dealing with the uprising. Cedillo is convinced that the Santa Muerte cult are responsible for inciting the commonfolk to riot, and likely have agents within Veracruz. He professes that a thorough sweep of the city, avoiding the main areas of unrest in favor of a deep search, street by street, house by house, room by room, is what should take precedence in order to uncover any agent of the rebellion."

While the Field Marshal's plan was meant to be a less aggressive and dangerous answer to a direct assault on the city, the army chief's plan of slow encirclement is far from a passive response. Using suppression tactics and sheer brute force, anyone suspected of involvement with Santa Muerte, legitimately or otherwise, has been executed, often including even the families of those suspected of involvement with Cult. \n\nAs cruel and uncompromising as the advance into Veracruz was, the results of Cedillo's meticulous rampage proved successful. Numerous individuals identified as acolytes and priestesses of Santa Muerte were discovered collaborating with agitators in the mob, supplying them with rudimentary weapons and bombs and organizing the rioters to strike targets of interest in the city. With the resistance cells in the city pacified, the morale of the rioters had been sapped as the army slowly closed in on the city center. By day's end, the army of General Cedillo marched into the plaza of the city center.

What awaited them was something far more sinister than they could have imagined, far beyond mere matters of state and sovereign, and would descend on them like the wrath of god. \n\nUnder the scorching heat of the morning sun, the army marched into the city center, where the bulk of the mob simmered in the pale orange light of the burning buildings that surrounded them. The rabble glared at General Cedillo with barely contained hatred as he ordered the crowd to disperse and return to their homes, quietly and orderly. The noise that greeted the Field Marshal's dictum was nothing human; a thunderous, ear-splitting roar as the mob rose up at once to charge at the lines and lines of riflemen before them, their number seeming to spawn out of the ether.

What ensued was a carnage unlike any Mexico has ever seen. \n\nThe rifles of Cedillo and his men cracked at the oncoming mob, killing dozens in the first volley, and still, the people came on, armed with little more than improvised melee weapons or bare-fists as their numbers continued to charge Cedillo's men. The fanaticism displayed by the rioters was no less terrifying; scores of unarmed men charged at soldiers armed with rifle and bayonet only to be cut down without the slightest concern for their own mortality, woman wrapped their arms around soldiers and held them in place as their comrades immolated them both with firebombs fill with kerosene, and at the height of the attack, an elderly man drove a truck filled with dynamite right into a contingent of soldiers moments before a flaming cocktail utterly obliterated the whole lot of them.

If such estimates are to be believed, and Tultengo's influence to be accounted for, the prospects of a native revolt in Mexico are very grim indeed, and with the fires of Veracruz still fresh in everyone's mind, the ARM regime, fearing that their southern flank has been compromised, has ordered a full withdrawal from southern Mexico, ordering General Cedillo to reinforce at his stronghold at San Luis Potosi to prepare for a potential strike against the Yucatan while the Gold Shirt's militias work to consolidate and fortify Mexico City in the event another uprising."

General Cedillo, meanwhile, seems to have been taken aback by the zealotry and cunning displayed by the Santa Muerte Cult and their allies, so much so that he has begun to eye the civilian population in San Luis with suspicion, paranoid that if the cult could influence the people of Veracruz so corrosively, can the same thing happen in San Luis? \n\nIt is because of this fear that General Cedillo suggested a method of striking against the rebels directly. Rather than reinforcing their ranks and fortifying San Luis, and potentially leaving themselves vulnerable to enemy infiltration, Cedillo proposes instead to order a lockdown of the area and prepare an artillery bombardment against the city itself from a fortified position overlooking San Luis. Cedillo argues that the rebels, given that their fanaticism was shown to be almost psychotic at Veracruz, would not respond to the bombardment of San Luis rationally, making the enemy abandon their plans in the city in favor of a suicidal assault the army's fortified position, recklessly throwing their lives away to protect the people in San Luis. Naturally, the general staff was horrified by the implications and ramifications of such a brutal plan, both by the plan's eerie resemblance to General Erich von Falkenhayn's unsuccessful strategy of attrition in the German offensive at the Battle of Verdun in the Weltkrieg, as well as the obvious potential for immense numbers of civilian casualties of the population still trapped in the city."

The Nahua, the proud and indefatigable sons and daughters of the Aztec Empire, fiery and defiant, flying crop dusters and decades-old biplanes, flying so close to the ground they flew below the height of the buildings, almost kissing the street as they descended upon Cedillo's army from the air. The plane's pilots and passengers strafed the exposed soldiers with submachine guns and firebombs. At this, the paranoia espoused by Saturnino Cedillo was tragically and frighteningly proven right; just as the Nahua begun their attack, soldiers among the reconstituted army, conscripted into our ranks from the citizenry of the city, turned their rifles on their companeros, screaming ‘Morir Es Vivir!’ as their rifles cracked against their traitorous air-bound comrades roaring overhead. It was not long before the city of San Luis Potosi was a mirror image of Veracruz; burnt and burning buildings, dead and dying soldiers, and the people, cunningly bewitched by the rebel air assault, began running out of their shelters, rioting in concert with the rebel's assault, trashing and burning all in their path.

What happened next was something no one could have predicted; aircraft, outmoded biplanes for the most part, appeared over the horizon and began besieging the artillery emplacements from above just as the first of the rebels came roaring out of the jungle into the northern hills, harrying the defensive line with sniper fire, mortar fire, rifle fire and makeshift firebombs as the aircraft strafed the artillery emplacements with fly-by sub machine gun fire. Through it all, the drumfire of Cedillo's bombardment thundered against the city below, slowly and ruthlessly reducing San Luis to rubble as the creeping barrage continued to rake the city. But in this great duel of wits between General Cedillo and Santa Muerte's militia, the so-called Strongman of San Luis showed himself to be correct in his assumption of the recklessness of the rebel threat. Men and women were mowed down in human wave assaults to see the army dislodged from the heights, and the archaic state of the aircraft besieging the army meant that they were vulnerable to machine gun fire and were rapidly shot out the sky. By nightfall, dead bodies and burnt-out planes lined the hillside, the cannonade had ceased, the army worked to put out the fires in the city, and victory had been achieved."

That moment has finally arrived, formulating itself into even more of a threat than anyone realized. The Catholics, the remnants of the Christian faithful of Mexico isolated in the badlands to the North and hitherto untouched by the ARM's purges, have begun to resurge. \n\nFather José Reyes Vega, Catholic priest, legendary Catholic general, and an avowed enemy of Saturnino Cedillo, long thought to have died in exile, has returned, and with him, not only has he brought the militant zealotry and dogma of the Church he once fought for, but his zeal has only further intensified by a newfound faith in Santa Muerte and her teachings. In a radio broadcast wrought with the solemnity and imperturbability the priesthood is known for, he called upon the faithful warriors of Mexico, any and all who kneel before the light of the Lord, to once more rise again in open rebellion. Going further, he has proclaimed the formation of the so-called ‘Knights of Sonora’ - a new order of militants, ensconced in the deserts of northern Mexico where, like the Calatravans, Teutons and Templars before them, they have proclaimed a renewed holy war against the ARM regime. Additionally, they have formally announced their support for Maria III and called for the faithful to join them in their march on Mexico City, believing that, as Maria III herself proclaimed, God marches with them, and that the end of the Gold Shirt's persecutions is at long last at an end. \n\nIn response to Vega's broadcast, the ARM, fearing this northern revolt will soon join with the southern rebellion in an assault on the Capital, immediately ordered all available regiments of both the counter-revolutionary army and the Gold Shirt's militias to Mexico City."

mexico.171.t:0 "The March on Mexico City"
mexico.171.d:0 "Trepidation filled the air in Mexico City. Even as the common people tried to go on about their day, ignoring the soldiers marching, the armored cars patrolling the streets, the snipers on the rooftops, the checkpoints, the road blocks, they could feel as though something was different and looming. Both the army and the ARM administration must have felt it too as the members of the ARM leadership awaited an update from General Cedillo, who himself sat outside the capitol building with his army in the city center, watchful for any sign of corruption. \n\nIt was then that the first reports from the forward scouts over the radio made it clear to both the General and the government that something was coming just as dark-clothed figures appeared in the distance. They were of all colors; soldiers and shipwrights, doctors and priests, cultists and Catholics, old men and women to young girls and boys, all dressed in black, from elegant, embroidered suits and gowns all the way down to the tattered garb of tramps. They painted their faces like it was the Day of the Dead, beautiful as they were frightening. They marched in complete and utter silence through the streets of the city, leaving many of the soldiers near-dumbfounded, as much by their sheer numbers as by the ominous calm they displayed as they marched. And at the center of it all marched the beating heart of this silent rebellion: the Cousins Diaz were there, at the head of a contingent of Soldaderas, Don Tultengo marched, surrounded by his brave Nahua patriots. Father Vega too marched, flanked by his pious Sonoran Knights, and finally, the lady Maria III herself, dressed in the blue tunic, iron breastplate, and steel pickelhaube of a viennese cuirassier. Not the gown of a mere Habsburg courtier, but the garb of a true Kaiserin, an Empress. Having had enough of Maria III's impudence, a furious General Cedillo gave the order to open fire on the crowd, and from the radio, came a single, cold reply:"
mexico.171.a:0 "Morir Es Vivir!"
mexico.171.b:0 "Siempre Leales!"

mexico.172.t:0 "México Sobre Todo"
mexico.172.d:0 "At the center of Mexico City, under heavy rainfall, the first army volley opened fire across the plaza, followed by the screams of the condemned as the first of the marchers fell dead by the army’s bullets; their blood congealing in the mud under the feet of their compatriots before being swept away in the rain and before more their numbers were cut down to size. The crowd fractured seemingly in an instant, many of them scattering at the army's assault, and still more fell to the volley. Father Vega and his Catholics fell first, then the younger Porfirio Diaz. The Nahua ferociously tried to defend Don Tultengo before they too were gunned down as their king was captured by the Gold Shirt's militia men, the sound of their rifles booming in concert with the cracking of thunder. \n\nWhen the storm finally did subside, so too did any doubt that the army, and the ARM alongside them, had won the day. Upon his inspection of the massacre, Saturnino Cedillo would come upon a wounded Félix Diaz kneeling before the body of Maria III, the would-be Empress having been shot more than a hundred times, laying on her back in a great pool of human blood, her arms wrapped around the bodies of her faithful and her face as white as the Bony Lady herself. \n\n’Plans can change, even divine ones.’ Cedillo is rumored to have said to a defeated General Diaz before executing him on the spot. The victorious General Cedillo, cavalier at his success, rode back to the capitol building on horseback to inform the ARM government of their triumph, and upon his arrival, in an act mirroring Erich Ludendorf's Siege of Liege, greeted the leadership of Mexico by banging on the council chambers with the hilt of his saber, delivering the news that the Cult of Santa Muerte, along their insurrection, was no more."

mexico.173.t:0 "The Deluge"
mexico.173.d:0 "It was a great thunderstorm raging in the skies over Mexico City that heralded the end of the ARM regime. As an enraged Saturnino Cedillo screamed into his radio that the oncoming rebels be stopped dead in their tracks, the soldiery, meanwhile, sapped of all loyalty to ARM or their revolution, meekly lowered their rifles, bowing their heads, some even kneeling before the crowd as they made their journey forward, with the remainder of the Gold Shirts scattering like rats out of fear for their mortal souls. As the precession gathered near the door to the capital building, the Lady Maria Gizela de Iturbide von Habsburg, long thought to have died the night of the Gold Shirt Massacre, now stood before the building where her mother and sister were murdered, her face painted like a skull, the rose-covered visage of La Calavera Catrina, rainwater glistening off the steel of her breastplate, the flash of lightning reflecting off her spiked Pickelhaube helmet, a leather-bound bible clutched in one hand, and a gold-encrusted Gasser revolver in the other. This was the new face of authority in Mexico, this was the face that would uproot the balance of power in the so-called "free world", both in this life, and the next. \n\nField Marshal Saturnino Cedillo, at last, fell silent, the bellicose and ruthless Chief of the Army, the would-be architect of Maria's demise, stood at the foot of the door to the Capital, flanked by the few loyal militiamen of the Gold Shirts that hadn't fled already - the absolute last line between the ARM and the retribution that was to soon overtake them. ‘You frighten me, General, and you have caused me great pain.’ the Lady told him, her cultured, Viennese accent clashing with the gothic figure that stood before him. ‘Now, you see how crude such things are as weapons, for both Fear and Pain only exist to be defeated.’ At this, she placed the bible against Cedillo's face before perforating it, and him, with a bullet. By the time the storm subsided, the bodies of every surviving member of both the Gold Shirts and the ARM administration would be hanging from every street lamp in Mexico City. A new American empire has been unleashed as the Eagle of the South finally rises once more."

Initially thought to have been slain in the ARM's putsch a year prior, the sole surviving member of Iturbide dynasty found shelter among the enigmatic Cult of Santa Muerte, and with Maria III's ascendance to the throne, now with a populist revolt backing her, she is determined to reforge Mexico into an empire in something more than name.

The question, in brief, is what is too become of Mexico's Judicial and Legislative branches. What should have been a fairly simple issue, has become a focal point of division within movement, as both the Old and New Guard factions have taken a hard=line approach to the question. Carrasco and his New Guard support completely doing away with the 'Secondary Branches.' Believing that Mexico can only be great if the Presidency has the power to reform without any hindrance, the New Guard is frim in their stance that only a strong executive and stop Socialism for all time. This want to do away with checks and balances is viewed by many within the Old Guard as not-so-hidden attempt to create a dictatorships of one man. In defense of the preexisting government stands the Old Guard. While still seeking a great reformation of Mexican society, the Old Guard wishes to maintain Judiciary and Legislature though perhaps in a more streamlined form. Doing this to maintain legitimacy among other reasons, the Old Guard would see a Mexican Republic truly tempered and prepared for the modern world. Regardless, if the government is to avoid the fate of so many other Mexican governments, a choice must be made."

Under his leadership, Mexico is now free of the plagues of Socialism and Liberalism, and instead our nation now lies in the secure and noble comfort of nationalism and anti-European thought. Long holding a love for Mexico’s pre-colonial past, Carrasco has been known to dabble in Mexica and Aztec culture quite heavily, with his passion becoming obsession in the eyes of many. With these long-standing biases and interests only deepening as Carrasco delved deeper into Mexico’s past, and with his unparalleled level of current control, Carassco has taken this time as opportunity to revamp the cultural and national identity of the state towards a more post-classical, pre-colonial foundation. \n\nWith the initial ideas and new decrees in place, Mexico has already begun to shed its ‘Western’ influenced identity, and now the only debate is how far Carrasco should go. He could simply pay lip service and deep homages to the once noble Aztec empire and other Mesoamerican aspects of our culture, similar in ways to Mussolini’s famed love for ancient Rome. However, if left unleashed and unshackled, Carrasco wishes to not only harken to, but fully embrace and revitalize the culture and very essence of the fallen Aztec Empire as the new identity for our rebirthed state. Such a dramatic shift would likely cause immense growing pains, but with Carrasco already forcing many of his colleagues to refer to him as ‘Tlatoani,’ or King in Nahuatl, such a dramatic shift may be inevitable at this point..."

mexico.176.d:0 "With the revival of Aztec practices and Mexica beliefs, Tlatoani Itzcoatl II has decided to revive the 52-year cycle that is the Aztec Calendar of Sacrifice. With each of the 18 months and the final 5-day fast of Nemontemi each calling for a specific ritual or sacrifice in order to ensure specific occurrences, phenomena, and natural boons, this spiritual guide shall serve as the basis of our return to the Aztecs’ renowned sacrificial practices. These ideas, though seemingly barbaric, are based upon Mexica principles of paying tribute, or ‘tequitl’, to the many Teotl in the pantheon in exchange for gifts and continued existence. From the payment of these tributes - most precious of all being ‘chalchiuatl’ or blood and literally meaning ‘most precious water’ - the old empire and now our restored one shall be revitalized and sustained on sacrifice. \n\nFrom the child sacrifices honoring Tláloc in Atlacacuallo to the fiery executions dedicated to Xiuhtecuhtli in Xocotlhuetzin, all of our past traditions are to be observed and followed as closely as possible. With this claim however, many have come to wonder if our Tlatoani shall take his final right at the end of the cycle which calls for autosacrifice to ensure the rising of the sun and the continued survival of the empire, though Itzcoatl II has dodged these questions at all cost. Regardless, the vicious and bloodthirsty reputation of our people have been restored, and sacrifices honoring the Teotl have already begun in earnest. \n\nHeading into battle in one of our newly revived ‘flower wars’ - or wars with both allies and enemies used primarily for ritual and the gathering of sacrificial tributes - the high priests of Mēxihco-Tenōchtitlan have called for a preliminary sacrifice to grant the Teotls’ blessing upon our mighty warriors. The ‘Quetzalcoatls’, or high priests who bear the name of our patron god as their title - ordered loyal Cuachicuqeh (the loyal temple guard and most prestigious military order in the empire) to retrieve 100 prisoners from the temple complexes in order to prep them for traditional sacrifice. Placed atop a stone mantle at the peak of the rebuilt Great Pyramid, these souls were adorned in ritualistic garb and body paint before an obsidian athame was used to disembowel their torsos and excise their still-beating hearts. All one hundred hearts were to be offered up as tribute to the Teotl of War and the Sun Huitzilopochtli so that the great eagle lord would grace us with victory in the coming struggle. May their blood, our blood, the blood now given to the Teotls, be enough to grant us temporary divinity!"

mexico.1768.d:0 "The Borgia Group are a group of pre-Columbian religious and historic codices written by the Aztecs on their religion and empire. The codices - just one group of a large number of codices on the fallen empire - are named after the late Cardinal Borgia, who once studied them before the Vatican took ownership, along with other influential Mexican figures. They contain pictographs and passages about all aspects of the Aztecs and their culture and spiritual practices, as well as information on Aztec daily life, history, art, science, architecture, sacrifices, and more, but were lost to the Europeans decades ago. \n\nHowever, it would be our luck that shortly before our revolution, the main documents of the Group - the Codex Borgia (also called the Codex Youhualli Ehecatl), along with the Codex Cospi, the Codex Fejervary-Mayer, the Codex Laud, the Codex Vaticanus B, the Codex Porfirio Diaz, and the Aubin Manuscript - were in Mexico City being studied by historians, archeologists, and the Clergy. With the chaos surrounding our rise, the now-eradicated clergymen charged with safeguarding the books were slain, and these hallowed tomes have since fallen into our hands, joining Carrasco’s ever-growing collection of ancient Aztec codices. \n\nWith the knowledge and spiritual advice within the vellum pages now at our disposal, Carrasco and his Aztec-inspired New Guard have begun to further spread the revived faith of the old Mexican Empire, further forcing the nation to revere the Teotl pantheon and he raised himself to be one of these divine beings in the flesh. Even though we have recovered valuable pieces of our history, it has only served to fuel ‘Itzcoatl’s’ delusions of grandeur."

Taking this plan to its ‘logical’ extreme, Huey Tlatoani Itzcoatl II has even ordered that all cities, states, and other places in the realm be changed to use their Nahuatl names and spelling. Though this has certainly confused most in the nation as millions struggle to grapple with the new language, that has not stopped our ingenious Huey Tlatoani from instating this plan, for he swears that this is truly the best way forward for our new Mexico."

All across Mexico, loyal elites, generals, politicians, religious leaders, and business magnates shall be raised to be the new aristocracy of this new and truly native Mexican monarchy. To support these new noble houses, new warrior societies such as the Eagle and Jaguar castes of old shall be reformed, modernized and adapted to the modern realities of war.

This new ‘triple alliance’ is that of faith, nation and people, for this represents the creed of our movement and the three central pillars of our ideology. Supported by the Nahua faith and our strength under the Teotl, devoted to the Mexican nation and Aztec Empire, and ever caring to the masses, this new triple alliance stands united under the Crown of the Feathered Serpent that our Huey Tlatoani Itzcoatl now wears.

Most interestingly though so far of all these revivalist movements has been the environmentalist push to restore the old zoo and aquarium of Moctezuma, and to repair the ecological damage done to the great Lake Texcoco. The heart of the Aztec Empire and home to the largest city in North America, the lake once stretched far and wide across the Anahuac, but has since shrunk and grown polluted due to industrialization and poor agricultural practices. Even more serious still, the lake is one of the only places in the world where wild axolotls live and breed. These small, fully aquatic salamanders may seem insignificant, but are said to be the manifestation of the dog-headed Xolotl, one of the gods of death in the Aztec pantheon responsible for guiding lost souls to the underworld. Loving the little creatures, [MEX.GetLeader] has supported both plans openly, and has pushed for sustainable chiampas farming to continue in the lake, which historically provided an easy food source for the axolotls, while all industrialization and dumping being done in the lake were ceased by law.

Absolutely antithetical to the movement the ARM and Carrasco are trying to pursue, we must decide on how to deal with these traitors to our own brand of revolution."

All others involved in the movement will be offered a simple choice: join the ranks of our military and prove your loyalty, or face the same fate as your former leaders.

Under the guiding light of Frida Kahlo and the Triple Alliance Elite, a new age has dawned for the Triple Alliance - an age of Socialist egalitarianism, Agrarian economics tied to our past but modernized to fit our current realities and needs, and of respectful and adapted Nahua cultural revival. The Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān will finally be bathed in red; not the dirty, tainted red of our enemy’s blood, but the bright and hopeful red of indigenous Socialism and revolutionary republican democracy under the crimson beacon that is Kahlo."

With Kahlo rising as Tecuichpoch II, she will become our national matriarch and the face of our new nation and Mexicayotl Movement, though her health issues and constant need for attentive care leaves her unable to truly lead. Functioning more as a high priestess, cultural leader, nationalist icon, and spiritual figure, Kahlo will continue to work on her art and studies in order to build a strong and independent Mexican identity while the rest of the Triple Alliance Elite work to undo the horrors of the Carrasco’s regime under the ARM and build a true Socialist and Indigenous utopia here in Mexico."

Diving into this new Socialist indignous culture we have created, Rivera has begun a series of murals, sculptures, and paintings all aimed at expressing our new identity. Working with Kahlo along with David Alfaro Siquerios and José Clemente Orozco, this new artistic movement of Mesoamerican revivalism shall become the foundation of our new cultural renaissance.

mexico.188.d:0 "Founded by Frida Kahlo, Laurette Séjourné, Diego Rivera, Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza, and Pancho Villa, the Triple Alliance Elite are the true administrative body of the new Mexicayotl regime. Due to Kahlo’s multiple health issues, she has largely been relegated to being a spiritual and cultural leader only as the rest of the Elite administer the nation and our progress on the road to true Socialism. Many of the main members of this movement only joined due to it being the largest and strongest body of Socialist resistance against the Carrasco regime, and as such, the loyalty to our Indigenous identity varies within the group. Despite this uneasiness, a few key figures have risen to lead this movement while fully or partially adopting the new ideas professed by Kahlo, chiefly being Pancho Villa, Ricardo Magón, José Vasconcelos Calderón, Vicente Toledano, Manuel Camacho, and Lázaro Cárdenas. This diverse union of Socialists and Cultural Icons may have had little in common before our rise, but due to the dire circumstances Mexico was pushed to under the rule of the so-called Itzcoatl II, they have each come to embrace the Mexicayotl Movement in their own ways. Each of these heroes shall work to bring about a proletarian paradise here in Mexico, even if it must mean that they need to embrace Indigenous Nationalism and Artistically-based Socialism as a result. Under the guidance of Kahlo and the Triple Alliance Elite, our new Mexico shall reach true paradise."

mexico.189.d:0 "As we come back into control over the lands of the Maya, the Maya-inspired artists and poets of Yucatan and Guatemala have begun to openly support our new regime. Relieved over the collapse of the vile Carrasco regime, the Maya-blooded artist Carlos Mérida, Andrés Curruchich, and Rafael Yela Günther, among others, have begun to create new Indigenous art to support our cultural renaissance. Creating new sculptures, murals, and paintings depicting legends and images from wider Mesoamerican indigenous history, these artistic geniuses shall join the ranks of Kahlo and Rivera as we continue to expand our new Indigenous-based culture. \n\nCuriously, these artists has endeavored on a new combined project, seeking to figure out how the ancient Olmecs, Toltecs, Mayas, and more were able to construct such monolithic stone structures and artworks without modern tools, or even without things as simple as the wheel or beasts of burden. Starting their work by trying to replicate the famous monolithic stone heads of the Olmec, we shall wish these artistic geniuses the best of luck on their work for our culture."

mexico.190.t:0 "Remembering Our Rivals"
mexico.190.d:0 "The P'orhépicha Empire, also called Iréchikwa or the Purépecha Empire, was a pre-Columbian polity that existed around the modern Mexican state of Michoacán, as well as parts of Guanajuato, Guerrero, and Jalisco. During its day, it was the second-largest state in all of Mesoamerica, only outdone by the Aztecs themselves. The Aztecs and other Nahua called them Michhuahcān, or those from the place of fishers, and the two empires were known to be fierce rivals. Blocking Aztec expansion northwards and coming to be intensely defensive of their land, the P'orhépicha Empire was possibly the first truly territorial civilization in Mesoamerican history. Though they were eventually eclipsed by the Aztecs and faded into history, these fellow indigenous peoples held distinct cultural and social traits from their neighbors, even being famous for being one of the few Mesoamerican cultures to use metal tools and weapons - a feat even the Aztecs never accomplished. \n\nAs we continue to grow and develop this new pan-indigenous culture, we must remember to include all aspects of our history, and not just the famous parts as Carrasco and his fiends did. We will move to bring attention to this fallen empire and many other lost and forgotten Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Mixtec of Eight Deer Jaguar Claw or the Teotihuacan, the Zapotec, the Toltec, the Olmec, and more, reviving some of their cultural and religious beliefs while ensuring that all remember these ancestors of our modern Mexico."

mexico.191.d:0 "With a woman at the helm for the first time in Mexico’s history, and with the ideas of the Mexican Revolution slowly returning to our society, Frida Kahlo has moved to exert her cultural influence in order to bring about a new tide of Feminist thought. Painting new self-portraits, paintings, and murals while delivering speeches to the masses, Kahlo wishes to accelerate the natural social progression of our new movement in order to ensure all receive the benefits of this new state, regardless of their gender. \n\nTo aid her in this odyssey, Kahlo has chosen a group of select women to aid her in spreading these egalitarian socioeconomic views. Though this group has initially been made up mostly of other artists and academics that Kahlo had already known, including famous anarchist and writer Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza who serves under Frida in the Triple Alliance Elite, a few previously undersung names have also entered this new clique. Isabel Ramírez Castañeda, famous for her archeological and ethnological work on the ancient Nahua and their folklore, has recently joined the movement, and her expertise in the ancient histories of our ancestors will surely prove to be highly valued by our cause. With fine women like these aiding our beloved Tōltēcātl, there is nothing that our newly harmonized society will not be able to accomplish."
mexico.191.a:0 "All true Mexicans shall be honored, no matter their gender or identity."

mexico.192.t:0 "The Word of the House of the Sun"
mexico.192.d:0 "Alongside our new political and cultural movement, a new spiritual revolution has also begun to take hold. Guided by Frida Kahlo, who has been endowed with the honorific of Tecuichpoch II after the daughter of Moctezuma and famed priestess, has risen to take lead of a new church. Called the In Kaltonal, or House of the Sun or the Native Mexican Church to outsiders, this new religion under Tecuichpoch II represents a neo-shamanist revival of traditional indigenous beliefs such as solar worship and polytheism fused with contemporary cultural and religious ideas pulled from the Mexican masses, creating a custom-made and form-fit religion for the Mexican people that pulls on all aspects of our history to create a spiritual union all can embrace. \n\nAiding Kahlo in the creation of this new church is María Sabina Magdalena García the a Mazatec curandera, or traditional shaman and healer. Sabina is famed for being the first contemporary curandera and sabia, or ‘one who knows’, to share their knowledge with the Western world, letting non-indigenous Mexicans and even Americans and Europeans to witness her truths. Sabina’s teachings revolve around a life-giving and mind-clearing ritual known as the Velada, which involves the usage of hallucinogenic and entheogenic natural substances such as psilocybin-bearing mushrooms and salvia, and are known to heal the mental anguish of any and all who partake in her healings. With María Sabina joining Kahlo in the creation of this neo-shamanistic and humanist spiritual revival, we shall cleanse the reputation our religion has due to the barbaric practices of Carrasco, building a peaceful, traditional, religion for all under the Sun!"
mexico.192.a:0 "All hail Tecuichpoch II! All hail the Curandera! All hail the Sun!"

mexico.193.t:0 "A Strange Coalition"
mexico.193.d:0 "When the ARM of Carrasco dove further and further into villainy and totalitarianism, certain conservative and traditionalist figures that once went along with his antics found themselves reaching their breaking point. Abandoning the ARM, these figures, such as José Vasconcelos Calderón and Don Luis Moctezuma-Marcilla de Teruel y Gómez de Arteche, found themselves afloat in the rapidly changing Mexican society of Carrasco, that is until our own Mexicayotl Movement arose. Finding some common ground in our cultural ideas and unity goals, these figures - once our foes - soon became some of our closest allies. Though our politics may differ, we share the same desires for a strong, unified, and cohesive Mexican culture and society, and so these old enemies have become our allies, at least for now."
mexico.193.a:0 "The enemy of our enemy are our new friends."

mexico.194.t:0 "The Functions of the Aztec Triple Alliance Elite"
mexico.194.d:0 "Starting as a small group of Socialist-aligned politicians, artists, philosophers, academics, and veterans of the Mexican Revolution that fought alongside the likes of Zapata, the Aztec Triple Alliance Elite have risen from being a minor resistance movement warring against the false tlatoani Carrasco to being the dominant political force in Mexico. Led by Diego Rivera, Pancho Villa, Ricardo Magón, José Vasconcelos Calderón, Vicente Toledano, Manuel Camacho, Luis Moctezuma-Marcilla de Teruel y Gómez de Arteche, and Lázaro Cárdenas and using the beloved Frida Kahlo as a unifying figure and honorary ‘empress’ and high artisan. With this cultural and spiritual figure serving as the face of the new government, the Triple Alliance Elite work towards their idea of a ‘Nueva Mexicanidad’ society. Though many of the members of the Triple Alliance Elite would rather pursue their own avenues towards Socialism, they have little choice for only together can they undo the damage of Carrasco’s vile authoritarianism and rebuild the ideals of the Revolution, and so Kahlo shall remain as our true, but largely powerless, head of state while Socialist democracy is reintroduced to Mexico. \n\nLocal and state governments, as well as the national government serving under the Tōltēcātl, will once again change with the demands of the people, and the ideas of the Mexican Revolution shall be reintroduced back into wider society. Under the Triple Alliance Elite, Mexico shall now walk a fine and fused line between Revolutionary Socialist Democracy with an Agrarian and Indigenous focus while also maintaining, humanizing, and reforming this new Aztec republic to fit the needs and desires of the masses without losing sight of our Mexica, Toltec, and Olmec ancestry."
mexico.194.a:0 "A fusion of traditional Mesoamerican culture and Mexican Socialist Revolutionary thought."

mexico.195.t:0 "Incorporating Chicano Nationalism"
mexico.195.d:0 "The Chicanos are a new generation of Mexican-Americans that have long pushed for equality and civil rights as they languished under the control of the Yanquis. Champions of social reform and political inclusion, and of indigenous cultural, spiritual, and philosophical revival, the Chicanos are the embodiment of what the Mexicayotl Movement is trying to achieve across all of Mexico. Even using the Aztec holyland of Aztlan as their given name to the region of the American Southwest they inhabit, the Chicanos would be the perfect cultural group to uphold and make public as they provide an example for all of Mexico to follow. The movement has also seen popular growth without our intervention due to young firebrands, such as the young labor leader and Chicano activist Cesario Estrada Chavez, spreading their rhetoric across the lands of the American Cession, with new unions such as the National Farm Workers Association and the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee spreading the good word of this cause and our wider Mexicayotl Movement. The Chicanos and wider ‘Chicanosim’ shall be accepted by the state, and their ideas spread far and wide throughout all Mexico, so that all Mexicans within our new Triple Alliance can embrace our resurgent indigenous identity. "
mexico.195.a:0 "Preservation of one’s own culture does not require contempt for other cultures."

mexico.196.t:0 "On the Status of the Catholic Church"
mexico.196.d:0 "The ARM of Carrasco were famously anti-theist, taking their hate of religion and Catholicism so far that they began their Aztec revival in large part to replace the Catholic-dominated culture that had taken root here. Banning the Catholic Church, slaughtering the clergy, and moving to bring about an oxymoronic pagan-secularist revival, the ARM was cruel and unjust in their bloody persecutions. However, it was not long before their rise that the ideals of the Mexican Revolution were the ones chipping away at the Catholic foundation. It is no secret that many within the Revolutionary government tried to bring about secularism or even total atheism to Mexico, with many of the men now leading from within the Triple Alliance Elite being involved in anti-religious demonstrations and acts during our civil war. \n\nWhile we may not like the Church, it is part of Mexico’s history and identity - so much so that our own new spiritual revival takes some inspirations and notes from Catholic doctrine - and as such, we must decide what to do with it. Should we continue the ARM’s ban on the Catholic Church and the Christian religion, or shall we allow our people to freely choose their faith once again? No matter our decision, our new neo-shamanist faith will still be the only religion accepted, promoted, and spread by the state."
mexico.196.a:0 "Continue the ban. The one true faith is our neo-shamanist revival."
mexico.196.b:0 "Freedom of religion shall reign once more."

mexico.197.t:0 "Elections Under the Matriarch"
mexico.197.d:0 "Though Frida Kahlo, or as the people more and more frequently refer to her as the Matriarch or Tecuichpoch II, rules as the absolute head of state of Mexico, she largely only acts as a cultural and spiritual figure, and as a unifying face for the nation. Beneath her, Mexican Revolutionary Democracy is still beating fast and strong, for the lifeblood of republican freedoms and the ideals of the Revolution are safe her in this new regime. Though the Aztec Triple Alliance Elite was formed and is staffed by a wide coalition of Mexican Leftists and other cultural figures, the time for this coalition to finally split has come. Without vitriol and on agreeable terms, the coalition has fractured to give way to true pluralist democracy in Mexico once again. Now, elections are to be held, and the underlying doctrine of the Mexicayotl Movement shall now be solidified. Though the ideals of Kahlo will remain our framework and foundation, who is elected shall decide the new direction our democracy moderately crawls to under the guidance of the Matriarch and the Triple Alliance Elite. \n\nComing from this fracture are four main political entities. The largest and most dominant faction is the Anarchist-Agrarian coalition headed by Pancho Villa, Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza , and Ricardo Magón, and seeks to expand upon the ideas of Villa and Zapata aided by the non-Syndicalist anarchism of Magón and Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza. Their main rivals are the Social Democratic coalition headed by Lázaro Cárdenas and Pascual Ortiz Rubio, preaching moderate Socialism and Progressivism mixed with some Market Socialist and Liberal ideas, and the Anarcho-Syndicalists of Fidel Velázquez Sánchez and Gerardo Murillo Cornado, more commonly known as Dr. Atl. The dark horse of these elections are the European-inspired Marxists of Vicente Lombardo Toledano, Narciso Bassols García, and Indian immigrant Manabendra Nath Roy, who preach a fusion of Marxism and mild Syndicalism. Regardless of who wins out, we shall always air on the moderate side and follow the doctrine set forth by Tecuichpoch II, for only she knows the true destiny and best course for Mexico."
mexico.197.a:0 "The Social Democratic coalition of Cárdenas and Rubio wins out."
mexico.197.b:0 "The Anarchist-Agrarian coalition of Villa, Belén Gutiérrez, and Magón takes the win."
mexico.197.c:0 "The Syndicalists of Sánchez and Dr. Atl clutch a victory."
mexico.197.e:0 "The European-inspired Marxists of Toledano, Bassols, and Roy seize the day."

mexico.198.t:0 "Realities of Being the Matriarch"
mexico.198.d:0 "Reigning as the great Tōltēcātl, the beloved Tecuichpoch II, and the shining Matriarch of this new Mexico under the Mexicayotl Movement and the Triple Alliance Elite, Frida Kahlo is the face of the nation. However, despite all her influence and power of the minds of the masses, our high artisan largely serves only to guide the cultural and spiritual development of our society, with great aid from her brilliant art. Politically, she merely serves as a final stamp or veto for most procedures, for the Socialist democratic government of her partial design mainly rules in her stead. \n\nThough she is a devout Leftist and Revolutionary, her frail body and crippled condition largely leaves her unable to be a true, dominant executive. Struck by a trolley car at the age of 18, and suffering from health issues since birth before that, Kahlo is forced to spend large amounts of her life bedridden, painting on her special slanted easels designed for her by her father and dictating the cultural lifeblood of this new Socialist Aztec Republic from the safety of her own home. When she is able to be mobile, it is accompanied with great pain and the usage of clumsy braces, and only usually for public appearances, special ceremonies, important matters of state, or - most dominantly - when she is creating her larger masterpieces such as her famous murals, etchings, and frescoes. Though she shall guide our nation forever always, she must do so from the sidelines and shadows as the face of our new paradise."

Featuring mysterious and charismatic luchador enmascarado - or masked wrestlers - that never reveal their identities, and who do high-flying acrobatics and aerial moves to crush their foes, Lucha Libre fights are truly a sight to behold. With the great rivalry between El Santo and the Blue Demon - Mexico’s two most famous masked wrestlers - heating up, the nation is on the edge of its seat as yet another season of Lucha Libre comes to their local towns and homes through the radio.

However, with the borders now drastically shifted, these practices have continued, but in far different locales than the deserts of Northern Mexico. \n\nEmulating the past, it would seem that a new Tijuana has been born in the American border town of Klamath Falls, Oregon. The once quiet and quaint town has begun to rapidly expand, becoming a new urban center of sex, drugs, partying, gambling, vice, sin, and more for all the hedonistic Americans and Mexicans living near the border seeking to escape the boring monotony of their daily lives, even if only just for one blacked-out evening."

After being together for over a decade, the pair of creative geniuses have called it quits, ending both their romantic and artistic partnership. The nation is torn as to who to support in this mess, as well as on the opinion as to whether or not their art shall improve with this tragedy.

Barely divorced for even a year, the pair of artistic masters have once again announced that they are back together, remarrying in a quiet ceremony last week. Though the nation adores the art that these two masters of the brush can create, most in Mexico are largely over all the drama that has surrounded this story, with many openly exclaiming that they do not care about the love life of two artistic freaks. Though their art shall endure and their impact on our new culture shall always be felt and revered, many have begun to move on from these attention-hogging muralists for newer, more interesting avenues of excitement."

Varied in their patronage and reasons for being elevated, all are seen as heroes in the minds of the various outlying Mexican communities that revere them. However, a vast group of not only Norteños, but of Mexicans all over the nation, have come together to raise and revere another new folk saint; one of dubious reputation. \n\nPancho Villa is one of the greatest heroes of the Mexican Revolution as well as our skirmishes against the Americans, and has proven himself for decades to be a true guardian of the Mexican commonfolk. This reputation and his accomplishments and charisma have led many Mexicans to revere Pancho Villa as a Folk Saint himself, claiming that despite his Secularist and Socialist positions, he has proven himself to be the true champion of Mexico’s poorest and most oppressed citizens. Furthermore, many of the wild, bandit-like Norteños idolize his ability to humiliate both American and Federal Mexican forces, further adding to his popularity. However, many within our mostly conservative and pious court see Pancho Villa as a dangerous revolutionary and atheistic scoundrel, while Pancho Villa himself does not seem to keen over the idea as well, long hating the limelight and politics. The decision lies with the Crown under Maria III as to whether or not Pancho Villa should be raised as a fellow Folk Saint alongside Santa Muerte."

This revered healer and and curandero was famous for performing operations that caused no pain without the need of anesthesia, and for discovering many new cures tied to natural sources such as the Peruvian pepper tree or the large, sulfur-rich medicinal mud pool he would use as a pit to cure his patients in. Also known for using special cajitas and materias, or special followers born with a natural and innate ability to channel his God-given powers. A miracle worker of the modern Mexican age, El Niño Fidencio shall be sorely missed, but never forgotten. To honor this miracle healer, Empress Maria III has moved to name El Niño Fidencio as an official Folk Saint recognized by the Crown. Now, he shall join the likes of Santa Muerte and Maximón in the pantheon of new saints we give thanks and prayer to for their guidance and protection."

Others like her, such as our very own Juan Soldado, who was seen as nothing more than a rapist when, in truth, he was innocent and framed, and as such should be revered on the same level as a true Saint. However, now it appears that the Church’s feelings about our Saints have quickly turned around in the face of our Empire’s new strength. They have finally agreed to our demands of officially canonizing and patronizing our own Folk Saints. The elitist Catholic hierarchy shall no longer judge our brand of Folk Catholicism, and have now stated that if our faith allows the Catholics of the Americas to remain loyal to the Catholic faith, then there is no reason to fight against. This, in the eyes of our beloved Maria III, has been seen as a win for Mexico and for Santa Muerte. Now, we can truthfully proclaim that Santa Muerte is the one, true Patron Saint of Mexico!"

Despising his time as Governor Chihuahua but staying on in order to keep his oath to protect and bring prosperity to the people, Villa would rather stay out of the limelight. It would be just his luck then that one of Zapata’s final wishes for his term was to groom Pancho Villa to be his successor, for the Great Zapata only entrusted his old ally and friend with the herculean task of carrying on the Revolution without letting it backslide in reactionary thought or fall to authoritarianism. \n\nForced into a role he does not want and into a political dogfight he does not wish to participate in, Pancho Villa has been denied the quiet ranchero retirement he so longs for, and has been forced into the rat-race that is national level Mexican politics. Grooming his unkempt and wild appearance for the first time in years, this lord of banditry and master of guerilla warfare now had to once-again navigate the pitfalls and treachery of Mexican politics, in hopes of winning the next elections to fulfill Zapata’s dream. Begrudgingly acting like a tamed and well-mannered politician, Pancho Villa - going by his formal name Francisco for the first time in ages - would attempt to bring this dream of a Revolutionary, Democratic, Agrarian Socialist utopia to his beloved and native land."

mexico.225.d:0 "Sitting in a rather nice-looking but uncomfortable chair fashioned in some strange modernist style from Socialist America, President Francisco ‘Pancho’ Villa respectfully gave his answers to the hatted Yank interviewing him. Answering the current topic on what were his religious views and how did we balance them with his commitment to Socialism, Villa answered with ‘I’m not Catholic, Protestant, or Atheist. I am a free-thinker. I only believe in a superhuman power; but I like to respect all beliefs.’ This powerful answer earned an inspired chuckle from his interviewer - one John ‘Jack’ Silas Reed, one of the father’s of the American Socialist Revolution - as Reed began to ask the next question. \n\nAs the interview went on for over an hour, the pair talked about all manner of topics ranging from political to personal, forming a bond and cordial relationship. With the interview at its end, President Villa signed off by stating that he respects the American nation and their comital to the Socialist Revolution and to equality, hoping that the two nations could put aside their long-held differences and grudges in order to bring the light of Socialism to all of America, together."

mexico.226.d:0 "As the Catholic terrorists continue their foolish crusade against our righteous attempts to suppress the Church and it's antiqued school of thought, it seems that their mask of being noble crusaders is finally slipping in the mind of the public. This is due to their recent attack on a passenger train which they allegedly believed was carrying gold, weapons and reinforcements for the front. Their attack, led by the murderous and womanizing priest, José Reyes Vega, was seemingly only going to be a hit and run, but as our own forces responded to the attack, Vega's brother was killed, turning the alcoholic priest into a blind rage. In this rage, he ordered and than personally lit the wooden passenger cars, killing 51 civilians. While a horrid tragedy, this is not the first time Vega has as acted like this, as it has been reported that he ordered the execution of prisoners of war, via stabbing to 'preserve ammo.' With their own leadership acting like the heartless criminals our government knows them to be, a campaign to get the public to see the same way we do is underway, as it has been since the start of the uprising. Should these terrorists carry on acting like this, we'll be able to drive public support for them to zero, which due to the nature of the atrocity is already at an all time low."

New populist economic programs shall be created under the Crown to care for the masses and to sway the poor and downtrodden to our side. Furthermore, new education, health, and other societal reforms will begin to show the noisy Republicans what benefits they are missing by now swearing loyalty to our new, benevolent imperial system. We will bring about a resurgence of monarchist sympathy and support by showing the masses how to truly rule fairly and carefully. Though the Crown shall be the final say in all matters, that does not mean we shall fall to total authoritarianism or autocracy. The Crown is here to help our people and guide us into a new, unmatched golden age of prosperity and good-feelings, not to bend Mexico to some power-hungry ambitions."

Leaving behind their former barbarity, we will take the best aspects of the old Aztec faith and culture, such as their art and cultural customs, and fuse them with our new, Catholic realites.

Their best, most beneficial policies shall be revived, and their image shall be the type of constitutional monarch our María molds herself too.

From various war heroes, generals, politicians, police officers, and more, Emperor Porfirio shall name his new nobility. However, not too surprisingly, the Emperor has also moved to raise the entire Díaz family into nobility alongside him. With his cousin Felix becoming one of the most respected and highest titled nobles in Mexico now, Emperor Porfirio has also raised him to be the new leading officer of the Federal Army of the Crown, further solidifying his family’s grip over Mexico.

A Seminarian from the town of Sahuayo, Michoacán, Río is perhaps the perfect example of what the cancer of superstition and religion can do a person. Turning a once peaceful man into a bloodthirsty rebel, the men who held Sanchez del Río believed that only by renouncing his faith, in his home town to boot, would be the only way to pacify him. José Luis’ uncle, a vocal supporter of government in a community otherwise full to the brin with Catholic rebels, took it upon himself to get his nephew to renounce his faith. Soldiers stationed in Sahuayo escorted Sanchez del Río to a military outpost to begin his re-education. Our first attempts to re-educate him proved to be fruitless, thus with his Uncle’s relented permission, our men tortured his resistant nephew in hopes of breaking him. After days of torture, he showed no signs of breaking, so as a last attempt, the soles of his feet were cut and he was forced to walk around town with soldiers escorting him to prevent any would-be heroes from trying to free him. At the end of his tortured walk, a dug out grave was prepared for him in the cemetery with his family there to witness his last chance to redeem himself. As his uncle painfully asked him to renounce his faith and thus save his life, the stubborn rebel only shouted ‘Viva Cristo Rey!’ in response. With this final offer refused, José was summarily executed and buried in the prepared grave."

In order to garner loyalty from these natives, a public initiative has been pushed by the Crown and Church to liken Santa Muerte to the Aztec goddess of death Mictēcacihuātl. Being the main consort of the main Aztec death deity Mictlāntēuctli who rules over the underworld realm of Mictlān, the beautiful and haunting Mictēcacihuātl is the perfect goddess to liken our beloved Bony Lady to.

Likely seeking to keep the ideas of the Revolution alive by being the first major democratic figures to voice their support for our new monarch, these mainstay figures of Mexican Leftism and heroes of the Revolution have begun to embed themselves into the Crown’s cabinet so that they may begin to spread their vaguely Socialist ideas within the new government. With their announcement, more and more Leftists and Revolutionaries across Mexico have begun to proclaim their support for the Crown, rapidly displacing the idea that Monarchism is an innately Right Wing idea here in Mexico. Now, it is only up to time to see if their efforts are worthwhile."

Clara de la Rocha is to be declared a hero of our new Mexico, and her and her family shall enjoy all the benefits fitting for a patriot of her stature.

General Jaramillo served in the Revolution and is a noted supporter of Lázaro Cárdenas, and has been a dedicated though moderate Agrarian Socialist himself for many years.

All he has ever done in his life has been in service of this great nation, and he has risked life and limb time and time again in order to safeguard the state and its people from radicalism and other predatory, opportunistic forces. However, no matter what he does, political and religious extremists from all across Mexico’s diverse population continue to assail our nation, preventing Garza from bringing prosperity to all true children of Mexico. No matter how hard these radicals may try though, our Generalissimo has a way of dealing with this rabble. \n\nLeading various Socialists, Synarchists, Cristeros, Integralists, and more to far and distant lands in Mexico, Garza would subject most to work as laborers to serve their just time, but for the truly devilish, he saved a special punishment. Taking these particular unsaveables to Mexican airstrips or up into the Sierra Madre, Garza and his forces would give these radicals the free trip of a lifetime. Taking them up in cargo planes or towards mountaintop cliffs, Garza would give each and every one a free trip to the bottom; a one-way ticket to a face-first meeting with the ground. Simple, effective, clean, and most of all theatrical, Garza got a small and professional sense of satisfaction from sending his extremist enemies and traitors to Mexico on these true trips of a lifetime, for not only does it eliminate the competition, for it also further safeguards the nation with each falling radical."

Discussing possible trade contracts and other assorted business as they drank their tequila and smoked their cigars, the relative calm was disturbed by a shrill cry at the bar’s door. Bursting in full of piss and vinegar, a local extremist protester began to drunkenly heckle Garza as his guards moved in to prevent him from getting fully into the building, but Garza motioned for them to allow him in. \n\nLetting this poor drunk bastard dig into himself, Garza sat there quietly as the bumbling fool verbally dug himself a deep and deeper hole. Ending the hiccup-laiden barrage by hocking a loogie at Garza’s face, all in the room though the General would kill him right there. Instead, Garza smiled, congratulated his new ‘amigo’ on his bravery, and excused himself from the table. Standing before the activist, Garza offered to talk to him about the real issues privately in the beer garden out back, to which the inebriated fool happily obliged, ready to further voice his long list of complaints. \n\nBeing led out into the garden alone with Garza, the protester prepared to once again dig in, but the General had other plans as he rested his hat on the nearby bench. Quickly, quietly, and smoothly without hesitation or hitch in movement, Garza gracefully pulled his revolver from its holster beneath his jacket, pressed it deep into the activist's gut, and pulled the trigger, using his fat drunkard’s paunch to dampen the sound of the shot. As the now-silent protester hobbled over and bled out, the only noise to now escape his lips was gurgling gasps for air as Garza motioned over to two nearby guards to clean up the mess. Wiping off the barrel of his gun and his cheek of powder residue and a bit of blood, Garza readjusted his collar, donned his hat once more, and walked back inside to finish his meeting."

Furthermore, both Porfirio Díaz Jr. and Felix Díaz have been offered positions within the government and at the top of the military hierarchy under Garza himself, both to respect their efforts in safeguarding Mexico and to earn their loyalty as well as the respect of the masses, many of whom still see the late Díaz as a near god-like figure. Additionally, Garza shall also continue to emulate the Liberal Dictator archetype that Porfirio embodied, implementing many of the Porfriato's policies while also styling himself in a way similar to how Díaz once did.

Proclaiming the beginning of a new Mexican nation, - the revolutionary ‘República Socialista Federativa Soviética de México’ or the Mexican Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as modeled on Lenin’s failed revolutionary state in Russia - Camarada Toledano now will continue his march towards true Communism as theorized by Marx, Lenin, and now himself. The true heir to both these titans, he has fulfilled their wishes, implementing many of Lenin’s own directives and ideas as outlined in such documents as the April Theses and the Soviet Decrees, and now our Proletarian paradise truly marches in unison towards true Communist utopia.

Loyal militias and police roam the streets and countryside looking for rebels and would-be assassins as a nation-wide curfew forces all to hide away in their homes by the time the scorching Mexican sun sets. Though Zapata lives, and though the Revolution lives on, some cannot help but to wonder at what cost. The ideals of the heroic revolutionaries that saved Mexico from tyranny are now compromised, increasingly backsliding with each new day the nation lives under this new paranoid tyranny.

With his reputation as the freedom-loving hero of the Revolution only being sullied more with each passing day, and with the nation largely returned to the revolutionary status quo, perhaps it is finally time to end these harsh laws in order to save face at the end of his term. However, the rural countryside still may harbor traitorous snakes, so maybe it would be best to keep these laws in effect just a little while longer as Zapata finishes out his term. With new elections being organized in preparation already, the laws won't stay in effect long regardless of what happens.

Eufemio Zapata, fellow revolutionary but one who disdains the limelight or any notion of political power or responsibility, has recently gotten into some hot water, and now requires his younger presidential brother to bail him out. \n\nGoing out on another one of his famous benders, Eufemio Zapata got exceedingly drunk one night, went to the home of a rival general, and proceeded to scold and beat the father of said rival before puking in their garden and returning to the Palacio Nacional to crash on his brother’s couch. Even forgetting what he did due to the blackout he drank himself into, Eufemio now has numerous Mexican generals up in arms, with the son of the beaten man - one Maximino Camacho - promising to kill Eufemio should he get the chance. Using his powers and influence as President, Zapata has been able to smooth the situation over, giving Camacho a promotion as compensation and putting his own brother on temporary military leave until the entire mess blows over. Regardless of outcome though, this has just been another showing of Zapata’s personal biases, further tarnishing his reputation."

Famous artists like Fermin Revueltas, Diego Rivera, José Orozco, David Siqueiros, Aurora Reyes Flores, Carlos Merida, Juan O’Gorman, Alfredo Ramos Martinez, Jose Chavez Morado, and of course Frida Kahlo, among many others, shall all be rewarded handsomely for their work in the name of the state, and all in the nation now await what amazing new masterpieces these masters of the brush shall craft next!"

However, it is the physical pain and emotional agony that she has experienced that drive her to make such beautiful, emotional, and raw masterpieces. This terrible health history has sadly also led her to be frail, even having to end her own ambitions of becoming a doctor in the past which put her on the track to being an artist in the first place, and it would seem that her recent work has been too much on the artist. With Comandante Toledano’s strict deadlines for the portraits she paints as well as for the murals she works on with her husband Diego Rivera, Kahlo has thrown herself fully into her work recently in order to paint new masterpieces for the state, causing her to overexert herself and faint at her last portrait session painting Toledano himself. This news has left many worried and angry at Toledano, but the medical team working on Kahlo has assured all that she will be fine with some bedrest - something she has become used to in her arduous but inspiring life."

Only doing so to try and maintain his own strongman image which is what keeps the extremists and traitors at bay, it would seem that one artist did not heed Toledano’s warning. \n\nJosé Clemente Orozco is one of the three titans of Mexican Muralism alongside Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros, and as such he stands as one of the most popular men in the nation. Ever the famous caricaturist as well, it would seem with some of our recent policies being outside of Orozco’s comfort zone, the bold artist took it upon himself to paint a large mural mocking Toledano in the center of the Zócalo - the main square of Mexico City. This massive piece has served to be the climax of a wave of anti-Toledano art that has swept various urban centers in the nation, but the previous art was little more than graffiti compared to this newest work. \n\nThere are three ways the state could go about this. We could either ignore the whole thing, allowing Orozco and the other bandito artists their artistic freedoms, or we could actually do something about it. Moving to tear down the mural instead, we could let Orozco off with a warning, or throw him in a prison cell for a while to soften him up, letting him serve as an example to all not to protest the Toledano regime. With there being no doubt that Orozco painted it, having signed it himself, it is now up to Toledano to decide what to do."

Stating that suppressing personal freedoms and rights in such a blatant and biased way goes too far, these rioters demand justice lest they continue their rampage across Mexico’s largest cities as the countryside remains largely unaware or uncaring to all the commotion.

Rail will run over every mile of our vast wilderness as we link the nation like never before using new technologies and old to bring about a true Communist utopia for the noble working class.

Not many of these refugees are as high-profile as Viktor Nogin though. Nogin, a Russian Bolshevik, fled to Mexico shortly after it seemed that the Revolutionaries were certain to win, and eventually they did. For years, Nogin has lived under the radar, quietly living his life while even more quietly espousing his same old radical views. However, Nogin has now come to our government, seemingly paranoid, and begging for help. Nogin claims that he is being followed, purportedly by Russian agents out to assassinate this so-called ‘traitor.’ Whether he is to be believed is a different story, and a decision only Comandate Toledano can make. He could give Nogin a military commission given his proven Socialist record, allowing him to lie low with a militia under his command who would also be able to guard him. Alternatively, we could just allow Nogin to stay within the capital, setting him up in a cushy apartment where we could easily retrieve him if need be. Finally, we could simply just force Nogin out of the nation, avoiding an international incident and ridding ourselves of this Russian mess."

The deal was so close to finishing, but was impeded when it came to the Russians’ attention that Viktor Nogin - the traitorous Bolshevik that fled the Motherland in her time of need - was alive and in hiding in Mexico on approval of our government. Seeking to rectify the situation as quickly as possible, Toledano called Nogin into his office in the Palacio Nacional, and was prepared to send Nogin into an easy exile. However, fearing for his life, Nogin refused to leave, and begged Toledano to allow him to stay in hiding in the badlands of our rural countryside. Foolish to think he would be safer here, Nogin was truly hopeless, for Toledano was desperate to secure a partnership with Russia at any cost. \n\nNeeding to mop up the loose end as quickly as he could before he could do more damage to our national relationship with these potential allies, Toledano casually walked around his office while trying to convince Nogin to leave one last time before he grabbed the closest heavy thing to him - an icepick mounted on the wall from his time scaling the peaks of the Sierra Madre - and smashed it into Nogin’s noggin. Hacking away at the skull of the cowardly Bolshevik, Toledano beat Nogin to death, cracking open his cranium with the icepick as he beat him again and again until Nogin stopped squirming and crying out in agony. Calling out to his guards to clean up the aftermath, Toledano readjusted his collar, wiped the blood from his hands, and sat down at his desk to phone Moscow, shakily waiting to tell them that Nogin would no longer be an issue."

In a prestigious ceremony complete with pomp and excess, Toledano presented a crucifix to the Archbishop, but it was no ordinary crucifix. Made of gold and formed in the shape of a Soviet Hammer and Sickle, the crucifix was even etched with crimson red glyphs and detailing. Furthermore, a small image of the crucified Jesus was attached to the handle and face of the hammer, completing this odd fusion of Catholic and Communist imagery. Though presented as a sincere gift, many believe this to have been Toledano’s form of a joke - a mockery of the Church he reviles put on display for the entire nation to see, and with the recipient powerless to deny this heartfelt gift. This stunt is just another showing of Toledano’s complete mastery over the Catholic faith as he further continues to bastardize the Gospel into Marxist propaganda in order to control the pious and conservative masses of our state."

However, interestingly enough, José Vasconcelos - the Cultural Caudillo and another leading member of the Synarchointegralist coalition - has been spared. Instead, Vasconcelos has been ‘rewarded’ for his great cultural contributions and societal significance by being subjected only to house arrest. Though he shall live on a rather cushy estate under constant guard, at least he has been spared the foul fate that shall befall his former allies soon. Furthermore, numerous other political enemies and rivals of Toledano have all met similar fates of public execution, life imprisonment, or house arrest, notably with Fidel Velasquez - the young Syndicalist who took over Toledano’s moderate PPS has he moved onto this Marxist journey - being shot dead personally by Toledano, only to be later hung from a tree in his own home town, with Toledano forbidding anyone to take the body down on penalty of death. Moderates seen as a threat have been jailed as well, leaving the government nearly entirely full of Toledano loyalists and begrudging supporters, inching Comandante Toledano one step closer towards total power."

Meanwhile, across the nation to the South, Canabal - long a political ally of Calles who served under him during the Revolution - has led his Red Shirts on raid after raid against local Catholic cells. However, ever the schemer, Calles has also moved to not only allow these two radically opposing paramilitaries to keep their old rivalry, but has even moved to fan the flames of conflict between them.

mexico.266.d:0 "Formed in in 1925, the Iglesia Católica Apostólica Mexicana, also known as the ICAM, was created by self-proclaimed Patriarch José Joaquín Pérez Budar, himself a former Catholic priest, in direct opposition to the Catholic Church's monopoly on the minds of the Mexican people. While not differing that much from the Catholic Church in doctrine, save for a lack of belief in damnation and supporting married clergy among other small things, they differ greatly in their attitude towards the Government. While the Papists are either down right hostile or at least unsupportive of the Revolutionary Government, the ICAM has been nothing but friendly. While they disapprove of some of our more socialistic policies, the ICAM is perhaps our most vocal supporter in the religious scene of the country. While most of the support is due to us sharing a common enemy within the Catholics, there is another reason. Around the time of their foundation, el Jefe supported their bids to take over smaller Catholic parishes with both men and weapons. While almost always ending in failure, the ICAM perhaps believes that by supporting us, they can repay the debt owed to Calles. With this being the cause, and with our fight against the Roman Catholic Church stepping up with every passing day, members of el Jefe's cabinet have suggested that we patronize this Catholic breakoff. While doing so would technically be against the Constitution, as it forbids favoritism in the sphere of Religion, it would be a great boon to us, as it would allow us to replace the foreign and dangerous Catholic Church with one that is both only national and one that could be easily controlled with a few 'investments' such as the ones proposed.

Our beloved martyr and national father shall never be forgotten, nor shall anyone come to besmirch his name or tarnish his perfect legacy now that Calles is gone. The personality cult around the late Calles shall only expand, practically becoming a new ‘rational’ state religion without faith as the Party under Treviño forces all in the nation to uphold a perfect image of El Jefe.

Emilio Portes Gil, the new successor to El Jefe, has moved to soften the image of the Party and the future of the Maximato, thanking Calles for all he had done to safeguard Mexico, but also stressing the importance that we must move on from his savage past. In a secretive speech addressed only to the Party, Gil revealed many ugly truths about El Jefe, and though many in the nation are already aware of these truths, the Party has still decided to keep quiet about this new directional shift. In the public eye, the ‘hidden’ evils of Calles shall be swept under the rug as all the good he did is amplified and spread as his surviving legacy. As we do this, Gil shall slowly erode the position of executive in the Maximato, melding the face of the nation into the larger Party as a whole. As one unified and faceless entity, the Party shall lead the Maximato along a new, less totalitarian but still highly authoritarian future that seeks to preserve the good of El Jefe while fully purging, erasing, and forgetting his failures as we move on into Mexico’s altered destiny."

Though not an easy task due to the nation’s long Catholic and folk-religion history, we have made great strides in this goal. Houses of worship all across Mexico burn or lie in a pile of blackened cinders, while others have been converted for different uses by the Party. The Catholic Clergy has largely been purged or sent into exile, and most lay people have had the common sense to drop their loose affiliation with any religion rather than facing the consequences. However, some still cling to these lies of the past. In private homes, abandoned buildings, and isolated farms, small pockets of private religious practice still exist. In small groups or alone, people hide away and pray to their dying gods, using the last of the theological literature still left unburned as their guide. Though we will not waste any more supplies and resources, or reputation for that matter, baring into every residence in Mexico searching for theists, we shall still eradicate these vermin if, when, and wherever they are found."

However, despite Garza's usually firm grip on the Mexican political scene, some groups have fallen through the cracks.\n\n Recently, a covert headquarters for the Partido Popular Socialista has popped up in the heart of Mexico City. Enraged at the news that these agents of Paris were able to set up a headquarters right under our noses, Roque became determined to stamp out this Socialist filth. At sunrise, President Garza departed on horseback with several of his allies to find and destroy the PPS's new headquarters.\n\n At the brink of dawn, Garza and his men descended, and after a brief shootout with some armed rebels, Roque's men ransacked the building, tracking down any stray members, burning their files, shooting any poor sap left inside and finally burning the building down once they had finished.\n\n Once the structure was reduced to nothing but ash and dust, Roque and his band departed, knowing that another covert group of Paris-Directed agents has been put down for good."

Notable, Roque has also refused to don the traditional Sombrero and beige shirt of the Camisas Doradas paramilitary, instead wearing a proper suit woven by Mexico City's finest tailor, accompanied by the Presidential Sash traditionally worn by our head of state, complemented by the best dress-shoes and pelt fedoras the Mexican State has to offer."

Supposedly related to Moctezuma I and other Aztec nobles, Barragán has long dabbled in ideas of Mexica revivalism, and now with a state to call his own, he can do just that. Already close friends with the Duke Luis of Tultengo, Juan Almazán, and to other modern Mexicans of noble Mexica blood, General Barragán has moved to have the ARM radical Carrasco executed for his radical bastardization of Aztec culture. Barragán has even moved to implement some moderate policies and programs from the First Empire.

At a checkpoint in Jalisco, two women were recently arrested after guards found that they had hidden away weapons and religious contraband within their own bodies. Filling their lower cavities with bibles, knives, small firearms, small crucifixes, and other paraphernalia all wrapped in corn husks, these Cristero smugglers were keen on passing these dangerous items on to the active insurgency.

With Presidente Eufemio becoming enraged at the lack of respect these reactionaries have shown towards his dead brother, he began to speculate that maybe the Synarchists had something to do with Zapata’s death. Alas, instead of pursuing this avenue of investigation, he decided to do what he always does - drown his problems away with tequila and find the easy way out. \n\nAs the Synarchists continued their protest in the states of Jalisco, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Guanajuato, Presidente Eufemio continued to live up to his drunkard repudiation, sending federales to crush the revolts while he sulked in the capital. Setting up police patrols with light support in order to deal with these protests in a quick and swift crackdown, Eufemio believed that these reactionaries were only a small organization and wouldn't prove much of a threat. However, it would seem that he drastically underestimated their numbers, for the majority of the time our federales were outnumbered by these protestors. All the while these crackdowns continued, and instead of looking into the death of his brother more carefully, the drunkard Eufemio sat in the National People’s Palace, drinking away his troubles and sorrow over the death of his beloved younger brother Zapata as these reactionaries continued to wreak havoc on our revolutionary republic."

However, the first step in such a plan has been to uplift what he calls the ‘depressed race’ that are the Iberoamericans into something more - the Cosmic Race, for only our depressed race has undergone the struggles and history needed to be moldable and universal.

While integeration will be a long and hard process, the walls between two peoples have been torn down, and in their place shall rise a new Catholic Union, the envy of the Orthodox and Protestant worlds."
mexico.292.a:0 "Vivat Christus Rex!"

mexico.293.t:0 "Mexico Requests the return of the Cession."
mexico.293.d:0 "Our Southern Neighbor, and our Brothers in the Lord, have formally requested the return of the Cession lost in the Mexican-American War. Citing our shared Catholic Faith among other things, the southern SynarchoIntegeralists are dead set on the return of this land, and have made vague threats of war should we refuse to hand over the land."
mexico.293.a:0 "We would never give up 1/3 of our country for anything, Catholic or not!"
mexico.293.b:0 "Of course! One step closer to true Catholic unity."

mexico.294.d:0 "In a move to shock the world, America has formally offered to return the Cession, in recognition of our shared Catholic Faith, in exchange for a lump sum and the creation of a military pact. Due to the sudden and unexpected nature of this event, almost all within the government are overwhelmed. Due to this, we have taken a bit of time to respond the only thing we can in this scenario, that being an overwhelming YES."
mexico.294.a:0 "Well, that escalated quickly."

mexico.295.t:0 "An End to the Regency?"
mexico.295.d:0 "It has been nearly ten years since the SynarchoIntegeralist movement first seized power within Mexico. In that time, Mexican, no, the entire world, has been radically changed. From a Godless Socialist Republic to the foremost example of Integralist purity, much has changed indeed. Along with this radical change however, came promises. Among these promises was one that some day, roughly ten years down the line, the Republican structure of Mexico would be undone, and the Monarchy restored. Indeed, the very Republic itself was and has been radically transformed, into what amounts to an Empire without an Emperor. With that ten year timeframe coming ever closer to ending, a whirl of political movement as taken the capital by storm. Almost all within the government, save perhaps the most inner circles, have begun preparing for the fulfillment of the Regent-Republic, with the Monarchy finally being restored. However, not all share this sentiment. Indeed, those most inner of circles surrounding Vasconcelos, and even Vasconcelos himself have begun privately questioning if the Restoration should in fact take place. While yes, the world has indeed changed, and Mexico herself come close to Catholic purity, the global situation is still one of chaos. This being the case, many have begun quietly whispering and plotting to extent the Regency, not just any amount of time, but indefinitely. While both sides to this question believe themselves in the right, only Vasconcelos can determine the fate of Mexican Monarchism."    
mexico.295.a:0 "The time has finally come, Long live the Empire!"
mexico.295.b:0 "Even with the regime secure, too many threats linger to allow for the Restoration to yet take place."

mexico.296.t:0 "Honoring Forgotten Revolutionaries"
mexico.296.d:0 "The Mexican Revolution was a long, hardfought conflict that saw the rise and fall of many heroes, but time has forgotten many of these figures due to controversy and prejudice. Many women and non-conventional revolutionaries have had their tale nearly erased from history, but the state has moved to rectify this issue by honoring these soldiers as heroes of the Mexican state. Though many shall be receiving their medals posthumously, one such figure to receive their medal and honors in person is Amelio Robles Ávila. Born a female, Ávila has lived as a man for most of his life, earning a name for himself by making true of his promise to shoot any person to call him a woman on more than one occasion. Serving under Pancho Villa during the Revolution, Ávila is an Agrarista loyalist, though has shied away from politics and the limelight since the end of the conflict, instead spending his time as mercenary, farmer, and rural vigilante. Ávila, along with many other forgotten figures, will never again have their name lost to time as we honor another generation of Mexican heroes."    
mexico.296.a:0 "We salute these heroes of the Revolution."

mexico.297.t:0 "The Little Maurras"
mexico.297.d:0 "Our proud integralist government has recently been approached by a rather singular intellectual. This man, named Guisa y Acevedo Jesús, is also an integralist theorist and nationalist politician, but he distinguishes himself by proclaiming himself 'Maurassian', from the ideology of the leader of the Action Francaise in France, Charles Maurras, author, poet, philosopher and one of the main intellectuals of integral Nationalism, having inspired many movements such as Acción Española in Spain or the REX movement in Belgium.\n\nDespite this influence, it was largely confined to Europe and had little influence in the world and in our Mexican lands. But Guisa y Acevedo Jesús escaped this rule, since he was exiled after the socialist takeover, he was able to be a disciple of the Master of Action Française, becoming close to him and even being called "Le Petit Maurras", dreaming of a Mexican Catholic integralist decentralist monarchy based on the Maurrasian model. He returned from exile after the fall of the socialist government where he animated several newspapers and conferences, giving his ideology a voice that it never had.\n\nAlthough some people denounce his strong ties of friendship with notorious socialists such as Diego Rivera or David Alfaro Siqueiros, no one can doubt his devotion to the fatherland and his anti-socialism. Many have asked our government to grant him economic aid so that he can continue his work, others have even proposed to grant him the post of Minister of Foreign Policy, and a minority has asked us to make Maurrasism our official ideology, a radical change that could bear fruit..."
mexico.297.a:0 "Give him funds for his work and express our sympathies!"
mexico.297.b:0 "Let's give this honorable intellectual a place in our government!"
mexico.297.c:0 "Make this Mexican Maurras a minister and make Maurrassism the official state ideology!"

mexico.298.t:0 "Bombing of the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe"
mexico.298.d:0 "Today, just after daily Mass was finishing in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, various pilgrims and locals alike were paying homage to the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe given to Juan Diego in 1531. As many do, a man placed an assortment of the most beautiful flowers, directly underneath the Holy Tilma. With this being a common sign of reverence, most thought noting of it. However, hidden within the arrangement was a bomb. After roughly 5 minutes following the arrangement being placed, the bomb went off, damaging the stairs of the altar, and causing slight damage to a few panels of stained glass. Thankful, no one was hurt in the blast, what's interesting however is that the actual image, the believed target of the bomb, was also not harmed in anyway. The most damaged thing, appears to have been a crucifix, which was horribly bent.\nGoverment reaction to this tragedy has followed in the hours since the attack, with President Zapata condemning it in a speech. Plutarco Elías Calles, the political chameleon of Mexico, has also condemned the attack, but only in a half-hearted manner. Due to this, and due to Calles' own radical anti-Catholic stances, many have placed the blame of the bombing on him or his allies. Due to a lack of evidence however, no action can truly be made against him, even if the rumors are true. Regardless, this attack shows all to clearly the religious strife which plagues the nation, and despite the best attempts of the government to stop sectarian violence, it is still alive and well in Mexico. Indeed, sections of the ASA have used the attack as further evidence of the government's goal to 'bring an end to the Catholic Church in Mexico.' Unless we are able to get a handle on the growing religious unrest in the nation, this attack may just become a new normal."

mexico.299.t:0 "The Last True Red Vaquero"
mexico.299.d:0 "A committed ally of Zapata and a devout follower of his specific strain of Democratic Agrarian Socialism, Pancho Villa has stayed loyal to his old friend as he continues his efforts to build a better and freer Mexico. However, new ideas from across the border have begun to influence our leader. From the American states of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, a new form of syncretic, environmentalist, and agrarian leftism called Cowboy Communalism has started to spread thanks to the efforts of the American entertainers Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Cisco Houston, Bess Lomax, and Will Geer, and the Mexican-American activists Emma Tenayuca, Fernando Palomares, and Rosendo Dorame. Spreading the idea that vaqueros and cowboys of the old Wild West were some of the first true Socialists in the New World, these Cowboy Communalists work together to build an egalitarian Socialist state built off of frontier democracy, agrarianism, ranching, and a love for the frontier - all similar ideas to what Pancho Villa himself espouses, causing Pancho to fall in with this strange international group as many in the movement are drawn to him due to his reputation and image as the last true Red Vaquero. So, should Pancho Villa stick closely to the party doctrine as laid out by his close compatriot Emiliano Zapata, or should he embrace this strange form of Cowboy Socialism in order to foster greater forms of Leftist Unity and to preserve Mexico’s wild frontier?"
mexico.299.a:0 "Stick closely to the ways of Zapata." 
mexico.299.b:0 "Support this idea of the Red Vaqueros."

mexico.3001.d:0 "Today, in the early hours of the morning, Her Imperial Majesty, María I de Iturbide passed away in her sleep. While at this time, her exact cause of death is still unknown, it is believed she simply died of old age, although some within the government believe that she may have been poisoned, citing her recent vetoing of a bill that would have curtailed the Church's control over the nation's healthcare system, one of the few times she ever made use of her veto power. Regardless, with our Monarch's passing,  the heir to the Throne, María I's eldest daughter, María Ana Tunkl-Iturbide prepares to assent to her mother's place. While the late Empress had wished for her young grandson, Maximilian, to inherit the Throne, due to his young age his own mother, the Empress' second daughter, expressed a desire for her sister to inherit, to prepare her son for his inevitable rule as Emperor.\n\nRegardless, María Ana Tunkl-Iturbide, taking the regal name of María II, has ascended to the Throne, being quickly coronated in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe by the Archbishop. Prepared to rule much like her mother before her, her first act as Empress has been to declare a week of mourning, along with declaring the late Empress' birthday to be a national holiday. Along with this, the Empress has allegedly asked the Church to being an investigation into her mother, and if found worthy, to begin the process of canonization. In any case, Mexico has a new monarch, long may she reign!"

Although talks of a possible ceasefire would seem like the obvious option, some within our command are convinced that the forces which have foolishly chosen to support the collapsed Mexican entity have been severely weakened, and they are confident that our armies are more than capable enough to take out the entire alliance. The decision is up to the highest heads of our government, should we call for peace or shall we continue the fight?"

## Democratic Events ##
mexicodemocratic.1.title:0 "Start of the Constitutional Convention"
mexicodemocratic.1.desc:0 "The Nuevo Congreso Constituyente has convened in Mexico City in order to hold a new Constitutional Convention. Here, the ministers of the Liga Democrática will, through shrewd debate and carefully orchestrated cooperation, outline the framework of our rebirthed republican system with a new democratic constitution - the Constitución Política de México. As delegates from all major parties, from PRUN to the PLM, arrive and cross the Plaza del Zócalo into the National Palace, the final preparations are being made before this historical convention can be held. With an initially agreed-upon plan for the proceedings being known to all before we begin, the general framework of our future constitution is already partially agreed upon. However, this does not mean that this meeting of the New Constituent Congress will be any short or quick affair - days upon days of debate, compromise, and argumentation are expected, and the process could easily evolve into a multi-week ordeal. Regardless of the time it takes, at the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention, we shall have a secure republican foundation off of which we can safely launch our first fair and free elections. Now come, let us make history!"
mexicodemocratic.1.a:0 "Let the Convention begin!"

mexicodemocratic.2.title:0 "Fate of the Socialist Radicals"
mexicodemocratic.2.desc:0 "Now that most of the radical Leftists that once harassed and suppressed our nation, from the banditos of Pancho Villa to the fanatics of Zapata, have all either been captured, killed in the process, or for some lucky few, simply knowing where their current holdout is, a final decision must be made on what to do with these Socialists. Before us stands three clear, cut and dry options, and each holds their own weight. We could simply execute them all, ridding Mexico of their viral taint but also establishing a bloody reputation that many within the nation will come to revile or even fear. Alternatively, we could simply exile these extremists, forcing them all into whatever wastes lie outside our nation, to be some other nation’s problem. However, there is always the possibility that they will return and in greater force. The third option, seen as the middle ground to many, is to simply put them all on trial and sentence them to lifelong prison sentences as traitors of the state. While we would have to take care of these whelps within their protective cells, it would not lower our regime to be murderers like those we are trying to persecute, and not leave them to potentially return with support if exiled. With the ministers of the LD torn over this issue, it is unsure which group will come out on top."
mexicodemocratic.2.a:0 "Execute them all! We have munitions to spare."
mexicodemocratic.2.b:0 "Arrest them officially and put them before a ‘fair’ trial."
mexicodemocratic.2.c:0 "Exile these traitors from the sacred soil of Mexico."

mexicodemocratic.3.title:0 "Fate of the Nationalist Radicals"
mexicodemocratic.3.desc:0 "With true democracy and Republicanism returning to Mexico at great last, true peace and justice are just that much closer/ With this great victory for justice and peace, questions now arise about the fate of the extremist, nationalist, traitors of the ASA. Though many in our cabinet have pushed for simply exiling them, that is not an option in this case, for no place on Earth currently would openly accept a bunch of failed, unorganized, and thoroughly beaten Mexican nationalists into their ranks. Instead, we have two main routes to enforce justice on these rabble rousers. We can put down each one of these dogs with a round inscribed with their own name - one for every traitor in the bunch. However, this would likely set a bloody precedent others in the nation could look to as a dangerous example. As an alternative, many have instead suggested holding a show trial, condemning each of these radicals to stand before a judge and jury and be sentenced to life in prison. Though a less satisfying and more expensive form of justice, it would go a long way in sealing our legitimate image in the eyes of the masses. What shall we do?"
mexicodemocratic.3.a:0 "Execute them all! We have munitions to spare."
mexicodemocratic.3.b:0 "Arrest them officially and put them before a ‘fair’ trial."

mexicodemocratic.4.title:0 "The Campesino War"
mexicodemocratic.4.desc:0 "While democracy has been restored and a new age of peace is dawning over Mexico, we cannot fully celebrate just yet, for the Campesino Wars still rage in the countryside. The Campesinos, or tenant farmers of the crumbling Ejido system and other agricultural cooperatives and rented parcels, have raged against the urban-centered government for far too long, and something must finally be done. With our renewed strength and newfound stability, we are in a opportune position to finally end this peasant uprising. We can either march our troops directly into their largest known strongholds, eradicating their numbers and decimating their organization structure despite the likely high amount of casualties that will affect both sides. In contrast, we could instead approach their leaders peacefully, and through compromise and cooperation we could attempt to work towards a peaceful resolution without spilling a drop of innocent blood. With our administration free to do as they wish in this instance, it is truly up to us how we should handle the Campesinos."
mexicodemocratic.4.a:0 "No negotiations! March into the countryside and set fire to their deluded dream."
mexicodemocratic.4.b:0 "Call for a ceasefire so we can negotiate agreeable terms."

mexicodemocratic.5.title:0 "State of the Army"
mexicodemocratic.5.desc:0 "The foolish move to make our armed forces an independent and unchecked arm of the state is the very move that allowed the forces of Garza to overthrow the ruling socialist regime. Now that republicanism has been reintroduced and with civilian leaders back in control, many ministers of the LD have become preoccupied with the fear of it happening again. We need to finally decide what to do with the army: let the dangerous but long-standing status quo ride - possibly earning the military’s loyalty but keeping them open as a possible rogue agent, or force the entire armed forces under the civilian rule of the republican government, which will likely anger the military, but greatly reducing the likelihood of a military coup plaguing Mexico ever again."
mexicodemocratic.5.a:0 "Let them be, we need their support."
mexicodemocratic.5.b:0 "Enforce civilian rule. The army is an arm of the state, not the state itself."

mexicodemocratic.6.title:0 "Fate of the Church"
mexicodemocratic.6.desc:0 "Now that the anti-clerical Socialists have been ousted from power, we need to decide how religion shall fit into our new constitution? The two most obvious choices are quite simple on paper: a Secular Mexico or a Catholic Mexico. However, the underlying debate could not be more complex. Catholicism is part of Mexico’s history and tradition, being brought here by Spanish colonials long before a ‘Mexico’ even existed. It has formed one of the pillars of Mexican society for centuries, and despite the Socialist’s attempt to eradicate it, Catholicism is still alive and well in the nation, forming one of the bedrocks of our culture. Regardless, many modernists, liberals, and moderate republicans all argue that while Catholicism is important to Mexican life, it should in no way interfere with our government, and despite many of them being devout Catholics themselves, they have vehemently pushed for a Secular state with religious freedoms instead. The question is still hotly debated among the ministers of the LD at the convention, but in the end, only one side can come out on top."
mexicodemocratic.6.a:0 "State Catholicism is only natural for a pious land such as Mexico!"
mexicodemocratic.6.b:0 "In the pursuit of modernity and equality, Mexico shall be Secular!"

mexicodemocratic.7.title:0 "Debate Over Republican Term Lengths"
mexicodemocratic.7.desc:0 "With democratic elections slowly being prepared in the background as this convention drags on, we need to preemptively decide how long a republican term shall be, keeping in mind that each executive can only sit for one full term at maximum. Like all debates within the convention, this too is split along party lines, with Liberals like those in the PLC championing a 4-year term, while Social Democrats and Progressives from the PCP and PLM are pushing for 5 years. Finally, the Conservatives of the PRUN and PAN have called for the largest term length at 6 years each. With each having their merits and drawbacks, what should we go with to solidify republican electoral term limits for generations to come?"
mexicodemocratic.7.a:0 "Go with the Liberal plan of 4-year terms."
mexicodemocratic.7.b:0 "The Progressives make a point. Go with 5-year terms."
mexicodemocratic.7.c:0 "The Conservatives are quite convincing. 6-year terms it will be."

mexicodemocratic.8.title:0 "Power of the Executive"
mexicodemocratic.8.desc:0 "With term limits determined and the general framework of our republic coming into formation, we need to decide how much power the head of government will have. Do we need a strong Executive or do we weaken its power? A strong executive is favored by the Conservatives, who view the position as above the other branches of government, being the main vehicle of change in the future republic. However, the Progressives and Liberals fear a strong executive will erode democracy and give way to authoritarianism. They propose instead that the executive should be shackled to the other branches of the government as an equal, with fair checks and balances between the branches to keep all in check. This proposal is seen as weak and naive by the Conservatives, who feel that without a strong executive, the nation will be at the slow mercy of a legislature that never acts quickly or decisively when needed. Both sides have made their points, and now it is up to the final internal vote among the LD."
mexicodemocratic.8.a:0 "A strong executive means a strong state! Grant the executive sweeping powers."
mexicodemocratic.8.b:0 "The executive is merely the mouthpiece of the people. Weaken their power."

mexicodemocratic.9.title:0 "A Unitary Mexico or a Federalized Mexico?"
mexicodemocratic.9.desc:0 "Mexico already has states - 28 in fact - and they are not going anywhere. However, with the Constitutional Congress in session, there is an opportunity to change what being a ‘state’ of Mexico truly means. The two main camps of the argument are whether Mexico should be fully federalized, similar to the system of the once-noble United States of America, or should we push for a unitary system through centralization as much as possible. Though the states would still exist, in this centralized system, they would be little more than organizational units for census data and election planning. A middle-ground between these two camps has risen as well, seeking compromise so that unity can be maintained. This moderate group calls for all states to be granted limited autonomy, with more troublesome states getting slightly more than the loyal states of the interior, in order to promote as much cohesion and unity as possible without hampering the rights of the people or the job of the government. With the debate still hotly argumented, the outcome is unclear, but soon a choice must be made."
mexicodemocratic.9.a:0 "States shall be little more than organizational units. Total centralization is the way."
mexicodemocratic.9.b:0 "States will be given limited autonomy, but will still mostly bend to the Federal government."
mexicodemocratic.9.c:0 "States are to have wide autonomy, similar to our northern neighbors."

mexicodemocratic.10.title:0 "The Final Debate: Republic or Monarchy?"
mexicodemocratic.10.desc:0 "The final, and by-far the most important and impactful decision of the entire Constitutional Convention, is to be finally decided after what feels like an eternity of debate: whether Mexico should be a Democratic Republic or a Republican Monarchy. The last few decades of instability and violent chaos have proven to many that the Republic model is unsustainable, prone to stalling, corruption, and military coups. These disillusioned democrats instead cry out that only under the restored Crown republicanism truly thrive in Mexico without falling prey to villainous taint. So dedicated to the cause, these Monarchists have even gone as far as to contact the heiress to the throne, Maria Josefa de Iturbide. Despite their jump at the chance to restore the monarchy, many within the LD still have their reservations, with most of the Liberals and Progressives decrying this move as an act of tyranny and a backhand to everything they have worked so far to achieve. These devoted republicans feel as though the only way for Mexico to truly escape the bonds of its past is to break into modernity with a free and fair democracy. With the debate over this question reaching new heights of vitriol and violence, a decision must be made soon lest the entire convention collapse into a brawl."
mexicodemocratic.10.a:0 "Mexico is to be a pure Democratic Republic, now and forever!"

With a strong, enlightened, but mediated monarch at the helm, and with a sound constitution and a shackled parliament under their control, Mexico shall be guided into our illustrious future under the leadership of a true noble. Now, all that is left is to decide whether to harken back to the Imperium of the Iturbides, creating the Third Mexican Empire, or shall we start fresh on a clean slate, creating the first Kingdom of Mexico?"

With the Primate of Mexico, Luis María Martínez, electing to maintain his position as head of state, Mexico is to be transformed into a Monarchy, under the rule of the Primate of Mexico, the Archbishop of Mexico City. Unlike under Synarchointegralist rule, the Primate is to be a nearly powerless position, only able to exercise control in times of great national emergency. Power shall instead be invested in the National Assembly, which shall then go on to elect a Prime Minister and a cabinet. Based on the Westminster Model, with heavy influence from the United States' Constitution and minor influence from the Kaiserreich, the new Mexico is to be one of Freedom, Liberty, Justice and Faith, watched over and protected by the Primate."

mexicodemocratic.19.desc:0 "From within the ranks of the military, and from the reactionary, nationalist, and Catholic Right, various figures and politicians have come together to form a new party - the Partido Revolucionario de Unificación Nacional. Headed by popular war hero Juan Andreu Almazán - a noted Conservative populist, staunch militarist, and noble nationalist - the PRUN is expected to stand as the bastion of the Mexican Right in the looming republic, using Corporatist economics to bring prosperity to Mexico while using their ties with PARM and the military in order to keep law and order from decaying the fickle beast that is democracy."
mexicodemocratic.19.a:0 "The Old Guard is ready."

mexicodemocratic.20.title:0 "Policy of the PAN"
mexicodemocratic.20.desc:0 "A new party has risen up within the congress - the Partido Acción Nacional. First and foremost a Catholic party, these Capitalist Conservatives are led by former UNAM rector Manuel Gómez Morín. With a main body formed by clergymen, pious Catholics, and Christian Conservatives, the PAN is popular with many within the massive Catholic majority, and as such, they stand a good chance at sweeping the elections. Through interventionist policies in the economy and through repairing the state’s relationship with the Church, the PAN seeks to bring pius Catholic democracy and non-predatory capitalism to our new Mexican republic."
mexicodemocratic.20.a:0 "The Conservatives quickly mobilize."

mexicodemocratic.21.title:0 "Policy of the PLC"
mexicodemocratic.21.desc:0 "Organized from the ashes of many old Liberal parties and groups, the Partido Liberal Constitucionalista seeks to bring about a Liberal renaissance here in Mexico. Led by the famous politician Adolfo de la Huerta, these ‘New Liberals’ of the PLC seek to usher in a new industrial and agricultural revolution here in our infantile republic, completely reforming the farming and ranching industries while massively industrializing. Simultaneously, the PLC is also heavily pushing for expanded Secularism, civil liberties, social justice reform, and unfettered free market capitalism. Under their brilliant guidance, Mexico will shine like a luminous Liberal beacon for this whole dark world to bear witness to, atop an unending mountain of profit."
mexicodemocratic.21.a:0 "The New Liberals try their luck."

mexicodemocratic.22.title:0 "Policy of the PCP"
mexicodemocratic.22.desc:0 "The numerous Progressives and disillusioned Socialists in the Constitutional Convention have coalesced into a single group, headed by pragmatic statesman Manuel Ávila Camacho. Together, these soft Liberals have formed the Partido Constitucional Progresista, which has attracted more progressive Liberals from the PLC and the ‘Right-wing’ Leftists that have fled the PLM’s rising radicalism. Preaching for mass industrialization, the creation of a true welfare state, and the promotion of economic interventionism, these pink Liberals and Progressives seek to bring true freedom and liberty to Mexico’s people. Preaching for civil and basic human rights over any God on a wholly Secular platform, the PCP seeks to win over the masses of Mexico with fair capitalism and a massive expansion to personal liberties, all safely swaddled in their social safety net. Whether the PCP can actually provide these progressive promises however, remains to be seen."
mexicodemocratic.22.a:0 "The Progressives are increasing in number"

mexicodemocratic.23.title:0 "Policy of the PLM"
mexicodemocratic.23.desc:0 "Like a phoenix from the ashes, the PLM - Partido Laborista Mexicano - is once again rising. Once the party of Obregon, the old PLM faltered before the ‘might’ of Zapata, and faded into a mere supporting role as history passed them by. However, since party-leader Lázaro Cárdenas del Río’s denunciation of radical Socialism, the PLM has begun to see a remarkable resurgence by offering a moderate, non-radical, and non-revolutionary alternative to Mexico’s historically violent Socialist movements. On a platform of pure Social Democracy, fair Social Capitalism, and the creation of a full welfare state, the PLM under Lázaro Cárdenas has risen to become the most popular democratic party in Mexico, standing a good chance of sweeping the entire election. With more former Leftist extremists jumping ship from their own parties, deradicalizing in order to join the PLM’s ranks, this labor movement seems almost unstoppable as it seeks to charge into our new destiny."
mexicodemocratic.23.a:0 "The Left is making its move once again."


mexicodemocratic.27.title:0 "A Clandestine Meeting"
mexicodemocratic.27.desc:0 "Our new leader [MEX.getleader] was recently called to a private meeting by previous Junta leader General Pablo Garza without first mentioning his intentions. Cautiously, our President agreed to meet with Garza, only bringing a small entourage of a handful of bodyguards for protection. Upon their arrival, [MEX.getleader] was shocked to find themself and the General were not alone, for aside from their poses, it would seem Garza had also invited the PLM’s party-leader and infamous Socialist Lázaro Cárdenas. What this meeting was to entail was only our President’s best guess, but it was not long before Garza motioned them all to the central table, only stating ‘We have a deal to discuss.’"
mexicodemocratic.27.a:0 "What kind of deal?"

mexicodemocratic.28.title:0 "A Promising Proposal"
mexicodemocratic.28.desc:0 "Once at the table, Lázaro Cárdenas spoke first, explaining to [MEX.getleader] as to how Cárdenas escaped the anti-Socialist crackdowns. Stating he was only working with Calles because of his great influence, Cárdenas has since-then disavowed radical Socialism and revolutionary action, reforming the PLM along truly moderate lines. However, in order to fully convince Garza of his new deradicalized attitudes, Cárdenas had to prove to them he was truly reformed, and the only way Garza was going to be convinced was if Cárdenas sold out his old allies. If Cárdenas was willing to tell Garza where top officials from Calles’ party, the PNR, were hiding out, Garza was willing to allow the PLM to continue operations."
mexicodemocratic.28.a:0 "Is he saying what I think he is saying?"

mexicodemocratic.29.title:0 "A Great Betrayal"
mexicodemocratic.29.desc:0 "Lázaro Cárdenas further explained to our leader that he himself, as a possible ‘successor’ to Calles - being his former right-hand man - could persuade much of the ministers within the PNR to cross the aisle into the PLM. This move would deal a death-blow to Calles’ support base, removing much of his influence and power over the government. This would seal the PLM’s fate as one of the allowed democratic parties, and eradicate any far-Left extremist threat, but Lázaro Cárdenas’ old friend Emilio Portes Gil would have to die. However, Cárdenas had already grieved for this eventuality long before the meeting was held, and he was ready to trade his loyalty in order to safeguard the Left’s place in our democracy for many generations to come. With our leader in agreement, the plan was ready, for Cárdenas already knew where his old allies were hiding. Now they only need the green light. ‘So’, Lázaro Cárdenas turned to [MEX.getleader], ‘do we have a deal?’"
mexicodemocratic.29.a:0 "Deal! The Totalist monster will be ended at once!"

mexicodemocratic.30.title:0 "A Deal Born in Blood"
mexicodemocratic.30.desc:0 "News came in early this morning that in an isolated, run-down ranch out in Guadalajara, Emilio Portes Gil - infamous leader of the post-Calles PNR - was found dead. Apparently receiving an anonymous tip that his body could be found there, police arrived on the scene to find the Totalist outlaw and crony of Calles lying in a pool of his own blood and brains - killed by a single gunshot to the side of the head. The reasoning behind his death is unclear, but the official story being circulated and promoted by the press and government is that he committed suicide to avoid capture, and a wandering shepard herding his sheep came across the scene by chance, calling it into the police before leaving o not get caught up in some trial. Though some maniacs and conspiracy nuts claim it to be the work of our administration, they simply have no proof to levy such outlandish claims."
mexicodemocratic.30.a:0 "How odd, and extremely fortuitous..."

mexicodemocratic.31.title:0 "A Peculiar Letter"
mexicodemocratic.31.desc:0 "Our leader has received a peculiar letter from the PCP’s party leader - Manuel Ávila Camacho - that has asked for [MEX.getleader] to meet with him over a rather sensitive issue - Camacho’s brother. Maximino Ávila Camacho - the older of the two - is a member of our military staff, and despite his numerous controversies, including dispensing public funds for personal use, attempting to seduce women and frequently getting into fights, is one of the most decorated generals in the nation. However, it would seem as though rumors have begun to spread about his supposed loyalties that the PCP leader wishes to speak to us in private about. We should arrange a meeting with him at once."
mexicodemocratic.31.a:0 "What did the General do?"

mexicodemocratic.32.title:0 "An Interesting Case"
mexicodemocratic.32.desc:0 "Arriving in Mexico City at the Republican Palace, Manuel Camacho began to explain to our leader the gravity of the situation. It would seem that since the Mexican Revolution, General Maximino Camacho has quickly drifted to the far-Right, falling in with the AAS, or at least that is what the rumors have spread. With our military requiring all officers to be apolitical by law, this is grounds for a court martialing if true. However, our leader - ever the beacon of true justice - has decided to hear out this case personally in a private government court rather than to make a decision based on rumors, hearsay, and conjecture. We will get to the bottom of these accusations, and we will find the truth."
mexicodemocratic.32.a:0 "Let's hear him out!"

mexicodemocratic.33.title:0 "The Camacho´s Case"
mexicodemocratic.33.desc:0 "Compiling all the scant evidence before him, [MEX.getleader] has attempted to shine the light of truth upon this sensitive case. While General Maximino Camacho aided Pablo Garza’s coup and the restoration of democracy, he is accused of holding sympathies towards the AAS by fellow officers. They say it is because Camacho is truly an ardent Anti-Socialist, and Camacho pleads that they are simply trying to remove him as an obstacle while trying to make it up the military hierarchy. With too many unknowns within the case and little to no evidence to decide by, [MEX.getleader] called Maximino to the stand to defend himself before a final verdict is made."
mexicodemocratic.33.a:0 "What does General Maximino have to say?"

mexicodemocratic.34.title:0 "Maximino's Speech"
mexicodemocratic.34.desc:0 "Stepping up to the podium, General Maximino Ávila Camacho gave an impassioned speech on his own behalf in a desperate attempt to prove his innocence and loyalty.\n \"I swear with my life that if the AAS or the Socialists ever try to overthrow this democracy made possible by the will of the Mexican people, I will fight them until I win or I die. I may be Right-wing, but I am a soldier, a Mexican, and a patriot first, and that is what really matters in the end.\" \nWith his words ringing true throughout the hall, [MEX.getleader] stood from their chair, turned to the veteran General, and granted him a full pardon of any and all accusations. No matter any past reality, Maximino was made a loyalist that day, even if our leader bent the law a little in order to see true justice come through in the end."
mexicodemocratic.34.a:0 "He was loyal after all!"

mexicodemocratic.35.title:0 "Business Scandal!"
mexicodemocratic.35.desc:0 "It would seem something has gone wrong for Miguel Alemán, for despite being a Liberal pro-business Liberal, he has started a surprise trial against one of the largest Mexican fire-arms manufacturers, Productos Mendoza. Alemán’s case is largely centered around loose accusations that the company supplied and funded the AAS durning their so-called crusade against Socialism. The official charges include gun-smuggling, war racketeering, aiding an outlawed extremist group, and much more, which if proven to be true would certainly destroy the company’s reputation and finances. We must get to the bottom of this at once lest one of the nation’s largest suppliers of firearms may be shut down for good."
mexicodemocratic.35.a:0 "What are you doing Miguel?"

mexicodemocratic.36.title:0 "The Supreme Court Intervenes"
mexicodemocratic.36.desc:0 "Because of the extreme nature of the accusations levied by Alemán against Productos Mendoza, the Supreme Court has taken over the case. With what amounts to treason, these charges do not come lightly, and the state is curious to find the truth at once before any irreparable damage is done. However, the accusing side has done little in the way of showing any real evidence, but Alemán has assured the court that he has something up his sleeve."
mexicodemocratic.36.a:0 "Let's hope you know what you're doing."

mexicodemocratic.37.title:0 "Miguel's Trump Card"
mexicodemocratic.37.desc:0 "Miguel Alemán, at first widely considered to be a liar at the start of this trial, has presented previously-unseen documents to the attention of the court. These papers outline the bookkeeping records of Productos Mendoza, and a specific transaction has been highlighted by Alemán for the courtroom to witness. According to the ledger, AAS operatives threatened the manufacturer, demanding an unmarked shipment of 10,000 Mondragon Riffles and 50 grenades in exchange for the AAS not sending its paramilitaries to raid the factory for supplies, destroying it along the way. The document was signed by the business leaders of the company and by the AAS Council. With this never-before-seen evidence now revealed, the courtroom has been thrown into a tizzy, and a recess was called until the ramifications of this new evidence could be processed.."
mexicodemocratic.37.a:0 "You were right Miguel, but why?"

mexicodemocratic.38.title:0 "Miguel Alemán Wins the Case!"
mexicodemocratic.38.desc:0 "Miguel Alemán, after presenting scathing evidence, has won the case, but at what cost? The leaders of Productos Mendoza have been arrested, and to fill their place, economic ministers from Alemán’s party - the Liberal PLC - have risen to take their place in a ‘temporary’ measure. With another massive manufactory under their control, the men of the PLC are just expected to grow more wealthy as these ‘traitorous’ businessmen face ‘justice.’ Calling it a mere ’act of the law,’ it would seem that Alemán was after a little more than just justice, and the PLC has been revealed as the true winners in all this misery."
mexicodemocratic.38.a:0 "You are a smart bastard Miguel."

mexicodemocratic.39.title:0 "Struggling Along Without UNAM Support"
mexicodemocratic.39.desc:0 "Democracy has been restored and most research facilities have reopened their doors with it, but some do not accept contracts or commands from our new government - the most important of which is the UNAM. UNAM, or the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, is the largest public research university in Mexico, and one of the most important research facilities in the nation. It is also a deeply conservative institution, which pushed back greatly against the former Revolutionary regime and their push for Socialist education. Without their aid, our research initiatives shall struggle along at best, but for now we must make do without them."
mexicodemocratic.39.a:0 "It is time to reestablish ourselves."

mexicodemocratic.40.title:0 "The UNAM Dilemma"
mexicodemocratic.40.desc:0 "The UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México) still has proven to be a thorn in the side of our new government, disobeying research requests from the government, hamstringing our initiatives, and protesting our administration every chance they can get. Distrustful of our new republic after so many bad experiences with the former regime, it is no wonder UNAM distrusts the government in any form. However, we are going to need their facilities and their help if we are to truly jumpstart Mexican technological advancement, and so we must find a way to compromise and cooperate!"
mexicodemocratic.40.a:0 "How can we solve this?"

mexicodemocratic.41.title:0 "Manuel Gómez Morín Intervenes"
mexicodemocratic.41.desc:0 "We have finally found a way into the good graces of the UNAM, for PAN party leader and previous rector of the university Manuel Gómez Morín has offered to mediate negotiations between the government and the university’s board of directors. With Morín’s help, we should be able to finally sway the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México to aid our administration in our national research efforts."
mexicodemocratic.41.a:0 "Let him try, for we have tried everything else."

mexicodemocratic.42.title:0 "A Compromise is Reached"
mexicodemocratic.42.desc:0 "After tense negotiations and interventions from the PAN leadership, we have finally reached an agreement with the UNAM. A noble compromise has been made and is as follows: all research topics and projects the UNAM wishes to cooperate with will be chosen independently by the university and its staff, however all military projects are off-limits, and will be handled solely by government labs. Furthermore, any remaining remnants of the failed Socialist education reforms will be withdrawn from the UNAM completely, allowing them to educate as they see fit.. Finally, thanks to Morín, we have earned the aid of the nation’s largest public research facility."

mexico_req.38.d:0 "Reclaiming the birthright of our nation has been no simple task, but the great expanse of Alta California, Tejas, and the surrounding territories have been reclaimed from the vile Americans, avenging the Spanish-American War of 1848 finally after nearly a century. However, taking in such vast amounts of gringo dominated land has been no easy task. The majority of the population in our new northern states are English speaking "Anglos" who have begun to actively resist our rule. These Yanquis are well armed, well motivated, and well supplied by northern contacts, and as such many within our regime fear that these former Americans will try to rebel against us given the chance. We must keep an eye on these scoundrels and snuff out any resistance before it grows out of hand."
mexico_req.38.a:0 "The Gringos will learn to accept our rule"

mexico_req.39.t:0 "Gringo Riots!"
mexico_req.39.d:0 "The Anglo population in our occupied territories have staged a number of protests against our rule recently, further fanning the flames of discontent and chaos in the North. Ranging from peaceful gatherings and illegal parades to major protests and acts of vandalism and mob violence, these expressions of the people’s will have not gone unnoticed, with our loyal police forces and military doing their best to keep these scenes contained and from spiraling out of hand, but many have still escalated despite our best efforts. Obviously, it will take a substantial amount of time until these gringos accept our rightful rule over Tejas, Nuevo Mexico and Alta California. Until then, we must crack down on these riots and fast, for with every protest and riot, their power only grows."
mexico_req.39.a:0 "Send more police to the northern cities!"

mexico_req.40.t:0 "Actions of the Anglo Resistance"
mexico_req.40.d:0 "The resistance of the Anglo population against our occupation forces only persists, with violence continuing to spread throughout our northern reaches as hope of crushing these gringos easily begins to fade. Once again, terrorist and seperatist groups operating within the Northern Territories have staged a number of attacks against our regime. These hit-and-run attacks are aimed at crippling our infrastructure, our industrial output, and the morale of our forces. With these attacks happening so frequently across the nation, we are stretched too thinly to be able to stop them all, and so must choose which sectors to prioritize and which ones to ignore for the time being. With our forces outworked and understaffed, we will have to abandon the calls for aid and ignore reports of rebel activity sometimes - a hard decision no one wants to make. With another wave of rebel activity being reported across the nation, which call shall we ignore?"

mexico_req.41.t:0 "Major Anglo Offensive!"
mexico_req.41.d:0 "We are under attack! Leaders of the Anglo resistance in the North have launched a major coordinated uprising against our troops! All across the old American Southwest, Anglo rebels and gringo guerillas have risen up against our rule and have begun to assault major northern cities and any fortifications set up by our forces, turning the Northern Territories once again into an active warzone. In response, our forces have already begun the long march to meet their foes, but the vast distances within our enlarged nation means the rebels will have time to dig-in and entrench their positions if we are too slow. Regardless, it would seem the fight for the North is not truly over yet, and so our troops once more shall march into this northern expanse seeking to avenge 1848 all over again."
mexico_req.41.a:0 "¡Oh! Y ahora, ¿Quién podrá defenderme?"

mexico_req.42.t:0 "Attack by Anglo Guerrillas!"
mexico_req.42.d:0 "The Anglo insurrectionists in the North have launched a full-on assault against our occupation forces! Our garrisons and fortifications across the Northern Territories have been raised to high-alert, with many more already facing the Anglo guerillas in battle. It would seem that yet another flashpoint has sparked to life, spilling the blood of both Mexicans and Anglos alike as our forces once more lock antlers and fight to the death. We must push them back!"
mexico_req.42.a:0 "Damn them!"

mexico_req.43.t:0 "The Second Texan Revolution"
mexico_req.43.d:0 "As if it was 1835 all over again, the vile Anglo Texans have once again reared their ugly heads, taking up arms against our regime en masse, and declaring both the Second Texan Revolution and the Second Republic of Texas, in the spirit of Sam Houston and the First Republic of 1836. We must make Santa Anna proud and finish what he started all those decades ago. There will be no Second Alamo, or a second or third or any free ‘Texas.’  Tejas is rightfully Mexican clay, and we will prove it to these gringos again and again with shot and blade until they finally learn this fact. We now ride once again to cross the Rio Grande to end this once and for all. Onwards to Houston!"

mexico_req.52.t:0 "Fate of Hollywood"
mexico_req.52.d:0 "With Alta California finally ours again, our regime needs to decide what to do with its famous film industry, once a pillar of U.S. capitalist propaganda. However, the Comité is divided between multiple different possibilities as to what we could do with this ‘Tinseltown.’ Some believe that we should leave the studios relatively alone, barring a new film censorship and approval board that must assuredly put in place to watchdog this den of excess and hedonism. Citing these sins and Hollywood’s history of graft and expropriation, some hardliners have suggested instead that the area be purged and razed to the ground so that we may build something far more useful for ‘el pueblo’ in its place. While industrialising the studios would boost California's recovery, the studios make a lot of taxable money, and our new citizens Norteños will be upset, which has pushed some others to instead advocate for either complete nationalization of the studios or instead transfer the estate to public ownership of the proletariat. With the groups only agreeing so far that a watchdog must be put in place like discussed, it is anyone’s guess who will come out on top."

mexico_req.53.t:0 "Reorganisation of the Territories"
mexico_req.53.d:0 "National elation over La Reconquista continues in full swing. Unfortunately, overwhelming euphoria is not without its overzealous drawbacks. Recently, certain national activists, civil administrators and other (generally traditionalist) voices have advocated that since the old Northern Territories have returned to us, we should likewise return the nature of their civil administration along revanchist lines - that is, the former U.S. states should be redrawn to match the pre-1848 borders of Alta California, Nuevo México, Tejas, even the Oregon Territory if our new gains allow it. These 'conservatives' argue that such a reorganisation would centralise administration of the old U.S. states and streamline governance over the North while exalting Mexican pride and erasing the estadounidense colonialism over Mexico's ancestral lands. The 'progressive' faction, meanwhile, dismiss these borders as vague even for the time, and further denounce the scheme as archaic, impractical and bound to outrage the Anglos more than ever. Instead, the progressives argue, the established former U.S. State administrations are already functional, well-organised and stable, and therefore should be adopted in full and merely expanded upon. Today, the Comité de Ocupación del Norte is scheduled hold a meeting and to adjourn with a decision on the matter."

mexico_req.54.t:0 "The Fate of the Alamo"
mexico_req.54.d:0 "It was inevitable that the question of that decaying symbol known as the Alamo would arise. As it stands, the Alamo is a rallying point for insurrectionists and a shrine for the old Anglo regime, practically standing as the Mecca of the Anglo resistance. Therefore, a resolution has been called for to renovate the building and thus repurpose its symbolic value — but again, this may only serve to incur the wrath of the gringos. As per the directive of the Comité de Ocupación del Norte, the Alamo will be..."

mexico_req.55.t:0 "The Status of American Indians"
mexico_req.55.d:0 "With a change in government, it is only natural that ostracised groups will seek support from the new government in hopes of finally overturning their fortunes. In this case, it is America's first peoples, with which we share a lineage of American nativity and European colonialism. Deprived of their territory, as well as their sovereignty, Indians now live like zoo animals in reservations, where poverty is rampant, and the proposed Indian Citizenship Act of 1936 does not go far enough in repairing centuries of subjugation. Therefore, we should expand on the act, as it is our moral imperative that we grant assistance to the destitute American Indian and begin lifting them from oppression at last."
mexico_req.55.a:0 "Yes, we stand alongside the oppressed Indian."
mexico_req.55.b:0 "These ‘Indians’ have no place in our Mexico."

mexico_req.56.t:0 "Status of Women in the Territories"
mexico_req.56.d:0 "Anglo women have taken to the streets in planned demonstrations — not against Mexican occupation, but for women's rights. While generally critical of Mexico's actions, suffragists have decided to make the best of our progressive government and have thus petitioned Mexico City to succeed where Washington failed by officially extending Mexico's Constitutional rights of women to the Northern Territories."
mexico_req.56.a:0 "Grant universal rights for all women!"
mexico_req.56.b:0 "Grant women voting rights in all local assemblies!"

mexico_req.57.t:0 "Status of Religion in the Territories"
mexico_req.57.d:0 "While Mexico has historically been a Catholic country, the Anglos take on the religious heritage of England: Protestantism. The people in the Northern Territories — Tejas in particular — are deeply religious, so the Comité must tread carefully as it seeks to tinker with religious policy. It would be foolish, however, to ignore intelligence reports from our spy service which emphasize how the local churches are condoning, aiding and abetting the insurrectionists, many of whom are zealous Protestants themselves."
mexico_req.57.a:0 "Enforce a state religion!"
mexico_req.57.b:0 "Enforce anti-clerical laws!"

mexico_req.58.t:0 "Status of Language in the Territories"
mexico_req.58.d:0 "The majority of both the Mexican and Anglo populations do not speak each other's language, which is already sparking incidents of civil unrest in the Northern Territories and our border states like Baja and Sonorra. While forcing the entire Anglo population to learn and speak Spanish would be impractical to say the least, perhaps some basic public programs could assist our troops and settlers in the North. The principal subject of this session of the Comité is simple. From schools and government operations to restaurants and street signs, what will be the official language that is used for everything within the Northern Territories?"
mexico_req.58.a:0 "Español! The gringos will learn our tongue and they will do it fast!"
mexico_req.58.b:0 "Bilingüe/Bilingual! We will accommodate these Anglos."
mexico_req.58.c:0 "English! We must appease these rowdy Yanqs."

mexico_req.59.t:0 "The Reintegration of the Mexican Cession"
mexico_req.59.d:0 "After many years of extensive resettlement, intensive propaganda efforts, and numerous crushed uprisings, organised rebellion against Mexican governance has largely subsided. While some resistance persists among old militia extremists, Anglos at large have gradually come to terms with our rule and settlers are now a significant minority in the Northern Territories. With Los Territorios Reconquistados firmly under our control, we've won unhindered access to its resources and industry as the Mexican Cession and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo have finally been undone."
mexico_req.59.a:0 "A decades-old humiliation has finally been avenged!"

mexico_req.9.t:0 "Reclaiming Our Lost Territories"
mexico_req.9.d:0 "In 1848, as a result of our defeat in the Mexican-American War, we were forced to cede nearly half of our territory to the United States as per the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in an event known as the Mexican Cession. The reversion of this treaty has been a dream for the Mexican people since then, but now there may finally be a chance of undoing this grave humiliation against our nation. Now, with the USA embroiled in a civil war of its own making, the titan’s back is turned, and now could be our chance to regain our lost lands and reassert Mexican control north of the Rio Grande, from California all the way to Tejas! The Americans can only cede land they still control, however, so we must move quickly!"
mexico_req.9.a:0 "Send the demand for the return of our territories."

Seeking to undo the Mexican Cession, they have amassed their troops at the border and now demand all of the land we still control that was ‘taken’ from them during the Mexican-American War. How should we react?"
mexico_req.10.a:0 "Cede disputed territory, we can't afford another front"
mexico_req.10.b:0 "Never! Those lands are American!"

mexico_req.11.t:0 "The Americans Refuse Our Demands"
mexico_req.11.d:0 "The foolish leadership of the United States has refused to accept our rightful territorial claims. They laugh in the face of our demands for undoing the Mexican Cession, and have gone back to focusing fully on their current conflict - though some within their regime have tried to coax our support through underground channels with territorial promises. These elements instead wish to buy Mexican support in their failing war with promises to give back land taken in the Mexican-American war. With this offer on the table, with their backs still turned, and with their resistance as desperate as ever, what shall we do now to the crumbling titan of North America?"
mexico_req.11.a:0 "Mexico shall rise to take America’s place in the New World; to war!"

mexico_req.110.d:0 "Though our initial try at diplomacy was met with rejection, it would seem Washington has further plans to ensure their survival. Their delegation has returned to us with a simple but interesting counter-offer: in exchange for receiving complete control over the lands of the Mexican Cession back, the Americans wish us to join the Second American Civil War on their side in order to help them beat the Pacific States and the Union State. Though they were clear they did not wish to throw Mexican lives away in the Rust Belt or the Deep-South, for they know we have no claim or interest to such territories, they have asked our armies to give forth full military effort in order to crush their Western foes. If we accept this deal, practically a third of their nation would be ceded to us - a steep cost but it may be the only way for them to win their foolish war. With opportunity knocking once more, what shall our reply be?"
mexico_req.110.a:0 "We shall fight side-by-side to undo the Mexican Cession and save their pathetic nation."
mexico_req.110.b:0 "We would rather die than serve with these Yanquis. Continue the war!"

mexico_req.111.t:0 "Hold Up Our End?"
mexico_req.111.d:0 "We have finally won the Second American Civil War, but before we can bask in the glow of our hard-fought victory, we must first deal with the meddling of the capital. With Washington’s deal with Mexico standing firm, and with the Mexicans proving vital in our final victory, their regime has come knocking about the land we supposedly ‘owe’ them now. With the deal struck and sealed with the spilled blood of both of our soldiers, it would most likely cause another war if we were to betray the Mexicans now. However, many within our administration have no desire to cede the land, citing they too spilled blood protecting this rightfully-American land, and they would be damned before they gave it up. With our hardliners itching for war and with Washington demanding we uphold our end of the deal, we are torn between duty and diplomacy. What shall we do?"
mexico_req.111.a:0 "We must obey Washington’s deal with Mexico City. Cede the land."
mexico_req.111.b:0 "This is rightfully American clay!"

mexico_req.12.t:0 "The Second Mexican-American War"
mexico_req.12.d:0 "Our refusal to accept the Mexican territorial claims after we fought and died together in the 2ACW was the last straw, and now we must pay the expected price. Mexico has already begun to consolidate its spread out forces into a new frontline, and Mexico City has already wired a declaration of war to Washington as we speak. We have held firm to this rightful clay, but have plunged our already war-ravaged nation into yet another conflict just moments after it had finished its last one. Now, troops of the National Guard, together with volunteers from the local population, are being mobilised to repel the initial Mexican assaults as the Second Mexican-American War springs to life!"
mexico_req.12.a:0 "All America shall know is war."

mexico_req.120.t:0 "Mexico Demands ‘Tejas’"
mexico_req.120.d:0 "Seeking to reclaim lost territories and undo the Mexican Cession, the Mexican government has sent a demand to our regime simply demanding the state of Texas. While most in our cabinet have laughed it off, for none are too keen on ceding our largest and richest state to a foreign nation. However, with the reality of our current war-efforts sinking in, many still do not wish to open up another front. We could try to call their bluff, possibly risking war with Mexico, or we could just simply cede ‘Tejas’ to them for now."
mexico_req.120.a:0 "It's Texas, not Tejas!"
mexico_req.120.b:0 "We must let ‘Tejas’ go for the good of the wider Union."

mexico_req.121.t:0 "The AUS Denies Our Territorial Demands"
mexico_req.121.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Union State government has denied our demand for the return of Tejas, laughing in the face of our claim. This has left us with two simple options: either pack it up and give up our ambitions for Tejas for now, or we could march over the Rio Grande and take our rightful clay by force! What shall it be?"
mexico_req.121.a:0 "Then war it shall be!"
mexico_req.121.b:0 "They have called our bluff; back down."

mexico_req.13.t:0 "Propose the Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico_req.13.d:0 "We've successfully beaten back the Americans and occupied at least part of our rightful territory lost in the Mexican Cession. We can send their humiliated leadership a peace offer now and demand that they surrender any territory we claim and already control, or we can keep on fighting and hope we occupy even more land. However, with the Civil War developing as it is, it may not be wise for us to continue fighting in America, so perhaps it is time to just take what we can and walk away for now, letting the remaining Americans kill themselves without wasting Mexican blood."
mexico_req.13.a:0 "Sue for peace, the people and our soldiers have had enough!"
mexico_req.13.b:0 "We shall keep on fighting, for all our lost land will be ours!"

mexico_req.14.t:0 "The Mexicans Offer Peace"
mexico_req.14.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of the Southwestern States have been lost to the advancing Mexican Army, and with our current situation we are in no position to stop them. The Mexicans have offered us peace, asking to simply keep whatever claimed land they already control in exchange for a complete end to all hostilities. With their troops threatening to advance even deeper into the nation, this might be the time to begrudgingly accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."
mexico_req.14.a:0 "Accept their claims, we must end this war right now!"
mexico_req.14.b:0 "No compromise until we are marching down Mexico City!"

mexico_req.15.t:0 "Signing the Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico_req.15.d:0 "Signed at the Alamo Courthouse, both for reverence of our shared past and for the Mexican government to further humiliate the Americans, a new peace treaty - the Treaty of Acapulco - has been drafted and agreed upon by the Mexican and American delegation. According to the Treaty of Acapulco, the Americans have agreed to cede all Mexican-occupied land in the Southwest to Mexico itself - finally landing us the rightful payback for the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. Any of our territory held by the various American rebels will have to be taken at another time, but for now we have secured a vast swathe of our old land, and now we must organize it."
mexico_req.15.a:0 "Hooray!"

mexico_req.16.t:0 "Propose the Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico_req.16.d:0 "We've successfully beaten back the Americans and occupied at least part of our rightful territory lost in the Mexican Cession. We can send their humiliated leadership a peace offer now and demand that they surrender any territory we claim and already control, or we can keep on fighting and hope we occupy even more land. However, with the war going so well for us, we could just continue the push to finish this for good, though doing so would likely waste more innocent Mexican blood as we progress deeper into the American interior. What shall be done?"
mexico_req.16.a:0 "Sue for peace, the people and our soldiers have had enough!"
mexico_req.16.b:0 "We shall keep on fighting to the bitter end!"

mexico_req.17.t:0 "Peace offer from Mexico"
mexico_req.17.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of the Southwestern USA has been lost to the advancing Mexican Army, and our forces in the region have been decimated. Shockingly, the Mexicans have offered us peace, stating that they will take all of their claimed territory in either our or their control in exchange for a complete end to all hostilities. With their troops threatening to advance even deeper, perhaps this is finally the time to accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."
mexico_req.17.a:0 "Accept their offer. We cannot waste more American lives."
mexico_req.17.b:0 "Decline their offer. We will never abandon these Americans!"

mexico_req.18.t:0 "Signing the Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico_req.18.d:0 "Signed at the Alamo Courthouse, both for reverence of our shared past and for the Mexican government to further humiliate the Americans, a new peace treaty - the Treaty of Acapulco - has been drafted and agreed upon by the Mexican and American delegation.

Any of our territory held by the various American rebels will have to be taken at another time, but for now we have secured a vast swathe of our old land, and now we must organize it."
mexico_req.18.a:0 "Hooray!"

mexico_req.19.t:0 "The Americans Refuse"
mexico_req.19.d:0 "Spitting in the face of our good will, the Yanquis have denied our offer of peace, instead wishing to fight this war to the bitter end. If this is the death they so wish to face, we shall surely grant it to them. We ride for Washington!"
mexico_req.19.a:0 "Fools!"

mexico_req.27.t:0 "The United States Accepts Our Demands"
mexico_req.27.d:0 "Surprisingly, it seems that the Americans were willing to hand over all of the land they seized in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, and with their decision, the Mexican Cession has finally been undone! Their internal problems must be brutal indeed for them to accept such a deal, but it matters not for us, for we Mexico has been made whole once more!"
mexico_req.27.a:0 "Our rightful northern lands were restored!"

mexico_req.28.t:0 "War Against the Pacific States?"
mexico_req.28.d:0 "Another rebel faction of the American Civil War, the Pacific States of America, currently control the Western Seaboard - a vast region that includes our rightful territories of Alta California. Though isolated, they have a strong military, a noble spirit, and an easily defensible swathe of territory. Should we march into our claimed lands here and take what is rightfully ours, or shall we just ignore this Western bastion, brushing it off as too much trouble to deal with."
mexico_req.28.a:0 "We march for San Francisco!"
mexico_req.28.b:0 "We have grown tired of this endless conflict. Ignore these lands."

mexico_req.29.t:0 "Victory Over the Pacific States"
mexico_req.29.d:0 "The Mexican army has overcome the armies of the Pacific States of America and are now in a position to demand their terms. Some in the government want the whole of California to be returned to Mexico but others feel that aggressive demands such as this will lead to another possible war in the future, or even more likely causing the deal to fall through. Instead, we could demand only the southern portion of Alta California, though that would leave much of our claimed land in enemy hands. Finally, we could just press forward with the war effort and throw diplomacy to the wayside, for it is not likely these Yanquis will agree anyway."
mexico_req.29.a:0 "Demand all of California"
mexico_req.29.b:0 "Demand the southern half of California"
mexico_req.29.c:0 "Continue the Offensive, the Pacific coast shall be ours"

mexico_req.30.t:0 "Mexico Demands All of California"
mexico_req.30.d:0 "The Mexicans have thoroughly beaten our forces, and now have come demanding the portion of their claimed ‘Alta California’ we have within our nation. Agreeing to these demands would end the bloodshed, but would require us to cede over half of our territory to a foreign government - a bitter pill to swallow by any margin. What shall be our reply?"
mexico_req.30.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."

mexico_req.32.a:0 "1848 has been avenged!"

mexico_req.33.t:0 "The PSA refuses our demands"
mexico_req.33.d:0 "The PSA has refused to accept our demands for Californian Cession, spitting in the face of our good will. Now, we must be forced to crush every last one of these West Coast Yanquis until every last inch of Alta California is once again under our control."
mexico_req.33.a:0 "We march for Sacramento!"

mexico_req.34.t:0 "PSA Troops Occupy Baja California"
mexico_req.34.d:0 "Under our direct order, loyal troops from bases in South California have crossed the border into Mexico and have occupied the Baja Peninsula. With our troops entrenched and poised to stab deeper into the heart of Mexico, we have Mexico City by the balls. In this position of power, now is the perfect opportunity for us to press our claims on the region while we sue for a peace settlement to our advantage. Alternatively, we could simply press this advantage and march to Mexico City itself to end this, though it's a long way there from Baja."
mexico_req.34.a:0 "Send a peace delegation immediately!"
mexico_req.34.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Mexico City!"

mexico_req.35.t:0 "Peace Proposal from the Pacific States"
mexico_req.35.d:0 "In a brash act flagrantly flying in the face of our national sovereignty, troops from the Pacific States have crossed the border into Mexico and have occupied the Baja Peninsula! With their troops poised to advance deeper into our nation’s interior, they have seized the opportunity and sent envoys to negotiate a peace settlement that is most advantageous to them. Should we accept their claims to Baja California and end the conflict, or shall we fight back against these foreign invaders?"
mexico_req.35.a:0 "Accept their offer. It's only Baja."
mexico_req.35.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Sacramento!"
mexico_req.35.c:0 "Continue the war, we will crush the PSA!"

mexico_req.590.t:0 "Arizona Revolts!"
mexico_req.590.d:0 "With Anglo tensions only rising and with the strength of the resistance only growing, it was only a matter of time before the Northern Territories fell victim to mass, organized rebellion. \n\nOne such rebellion has arisen in the old US state of Arizona, where a Libertarian-influenced but largely apolitical revolt has exploded, taking over key cities across the region such as Phoenix and Tucson already. Led by a mysterious former WCC aeronautics officer-turned-bandit only known to our intelligence office as ''The Man of Water and Gold'', this bandit lord and his gang of rough riders and miscreants have rallied much of Arizona’s Anglo population against us, and have even been able to sway some of the local American Indians to their side as well. We must crush this rebellion quickly before this folk hero gains too much popularity and power!"
mexico_req.590.a:0 "Goldwater’s Arizona shall be destroyed!"
mexico_req.590.b:0 "Freedom for Arizona!"

mexico_req.591.t:0 "Utah Revolts!"
mexico_req.591.d:0 "With Anglo tensions only rising and with the strength of the resistance only growing, it was only a matter of time before the Northern Territories fell victim to mass, organized rebellion. \n\nOne such rebellion has arisen in the old US state of Utah, where a Mormon-influenced coalition known as the ‘Deseret Militia’ has risen up against our mandate, rousing the rest of the region’s Anglo population to do the same. Calling their new movement the New Nauvoo Legion, these Mormon militias and Anglo protestants have devolved into little more than a bandit army. We must crush these vile heretics quickly lest their taint infect all of the Northern Territories!"
mexico_req.591.a:0 "Crush these heretics!"

mexico_req.592.t:0 "California Revolts!"
mexico_req.592.d:0 "With Anglo tensions only rising and with the strength of the resistance only growing, it was only a matter of time before the Northern Territories fell victim to mass, organized rebellion. \n\nOne of the largest of these rebellions has been within the old US state of California, started by a big-tent coalition of various political groups and fueled by American military staff sent in from Washington to instigate rebellion. With various militias hailing from republican, socialist, nationalist, and other varied backgrounds, the diverse resistance movement succumbs to infighting almost as much as it does fight our own forces, but they are bound by their love of American Democracy and that dying nation’s so-called values. We will eradicate these vile rebels, and secure order over the Northern Territories once and for all! "
mexico_req.592.a:0 "It seems the rat’s nest was not thoroughly cleaned out..."

mexico_req.60.t:0 "Altering the Reconquista"
mexico_req.60.d:0 "Despite the predictions of some of our best analysts and eggheads, the Yanquis have not fallen into total collapse and civil conflict like we had so hoped, throwing a major wrench in our international ambitions. Though most of our plans for Northern glory hinged on the Americans falling into civil war, there might be another way. The gringos are still weak, like a beaten dog licking its wounds, with a social and economic situation worse-off than even our own. At this crucial moment, we may be able to entice America to meet with us diplomatically in order to negotiate a deal that would benefit both nations. We wish for the lands lost in 1848 to be returned, so let us at least ask for them before this giant truly wakes."
mexico_req.60.a:0 "Send a diplomatic team to Washington."
mexico_req.60.b:0 "This is not worth our time. Mexico shall turn elsewhere."

mexico_req.61.t:0 "A Ludicrous Deal from the Mexicans"
mexico_req.61.d:0 "Just as we have begun to get back on track, another problem comes knocking on our door. The Mexicans, recently stabilizing themselves, have sent a diplomatic team to the President, offering a substantial payment and extensive economic aid and support in exchange for the lands they lost to us in the Mexican-American War and the following Treaty of Guadlupe-Hidalgo. Though it has been a long time since 1848, the Mexicans still hunger for their lands in the Southwest to be returned to them - mainly Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California, Nevada, and Utah. \n\nThough it seems wild to cede some of our states to a foreign nation, the Mexicans are certainly no foe to ignore, and should negotiations fail, war could always follow on the horizon. To ensure future peace, we could counter-negotiate by demanding an alliance as well, preventing us from getting stabbed in the back, or more our soft underbelly in this case. Alternatively, we could easily just flat-out deny this ridiculous claim, but we cannot be sure if the drums of war will sound shortly after. What shall we do?"
mexico_req.61.a:0 "I suppose we could accept it if they truly can pay a fair price."
mexico_req.61.b:0 "We will accept, but only if they agree to an alliance."
mexico_req.61.c:0 "Are they crazy? Must be something in the water."

mexico_req.62.t:0 "The Americans Agree"
mexico_req.62.d:0 "In spite of even our wildest expectations, the Americans have somehow agreed to our terms. The lands lost in 1848 shall be peacefully handed over in exchange for large amounts of economic aid and a huge payment, restoring our Northern border and making Mexico whole once again for the first time in nearly a century. Though it will take some time to integrate these lands and bring them under our control fully, we can now look to other directions, for the northern giant has been set to slumber."
mexico_req.62.a:0 "The Cession finally undone!"

mexico_req.63.t:0 "The Americans Agree, but with Amendments"
mexico_req.63.d:0 "In spite of even our wildest expectations, the Americans have somehow agreed to our terms, but with the counterdemand that we enter some form of a diplomatic agreement to not pursue war with each other. The lands lost in 1848 shall be peacefully handed over in exchange for large amounts of economic aid and a huge payment, restoring our Northern border and making Mexico whole once again for the first time in nearly a century. Though it will take some time to integrate these lands and bring them under our control fully, we can now look to other directions, for the northern giant has been set to slumber."
mexico_req.63.a:0 "Very well. An alliance for North America’s continued safety."
mexico_req.63.b:0 "We shall merely guarantee each other's independence."

mexico_req.64.t:0 "The Gringos Say No"
mexico_req.64.d:0 "Not shockingly, the Yanquis have denied our request to peacefully purchase the lands of the Mexican Cession lost to us almost a century ago. We are now left with two options. We can either turn our attentions elsewhere, ignoring the Americans and casting this off as an unfortunate but expected loss, or we can try our luck to best the slumbering giant on the field of battle. What shall we do?"
mexico_req.64.a:0 "As expected. Let us turn our attention to more realistic goals."
mexico_req.64.b:0 "Then we shall take these lands by force!"

mexico_req.65.t:0 "Where to Stop"
mexico_req.65.d:0 "Though the fighting in these arid deserts, mountains, and scrublands has been rough, we have been able to occupy the lands of the Mexican Cession. While the battle still rages across the front, we have achieved our goals. We could push for white peace, for the Americans are in no position to deny us, or we could simply fight on until they completely surrender. What should we do?"
mexico_req.65.a:0 "We have gotten what we came for. Sue for peace."
mexico_req.65.b:0 "We ride to Washington!"

mexico_req.66.t:0 "Goldwater Gets Angry"
mexico_req.66.d:0 "Furious over our reclamation of the Southwest, Governor Goldwater of Arizona has begun to instigate rebellious sentiments in our newly returned northern lands. Tensions have already begun to rise quite high as the populations of two nations now must learn to live as one, and ‘The Man of Golden Water’ has been slowly able to gather allies, such as from the independence movement in Texas and the Mormons in Utah, only bolstering his cause. If we do not nip this in the bud soon, we could have a full blown revolt on our hands. Should we begin to covertly sabotage Goldwater’s efforts, or do we believe that will only hurt our image and anger the gringos more?"
mexico_req.66.a:0 "Sabotage Goldwater’s efforts."
mexico_req.66.b:0 "Let them plan. Nothing will come of it. Surely."

ARMY_MEX_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 8, in Anenecuilco, Morelos, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Emiliano Zapata Salazar's military career began shortly after his political activism began, when he was forcefully conscripted into the 9th Cavalry regiment under Alfonso Pradillo in 1908, where he began experiencing the benefits and drawbacks of military life. With the Plan de San Luis going into effect and the death of Pablo Torres Burgos, Emiliano was chosen by the Southern Revolutionary Junta as the new revolutionary chief of the Southern Maderista Army. His first course of action was to take Cuautla from Porfirista forces, which was successful despite suffering heavy casualties. In order to increase recruitment, he promised every soldier who signed up with him a piece of arable land for themselves in exchange for their help in the revolution, and this tactic proved to be extremely successful with the disenfranchised peasants of the Mexican countryside."
ARMY_MEX_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 5, 1878, in San Juan del Rio, Durango, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W José Doroteo Arango Arámbula, better known by his pseudonym, Francisco Villa or his nickname 'Pancho Villa', has become a living legend for the people of Mexico. He started his adventure when Laureano Lopez Negrete, the owner of the Sombretillo Ranch where Doroteo worked, abused his older sister. In reprisal, he shot Laureano, and then evaded capture from the authorities, after which he escaped to the nearby mountains, where he was found by a gang of bandits lead by a man called Francisco Villa. He'd accompany the bandits for years, raiding and pillaging around Durango until Francisco Villa was shot in a firefight, and named Doroteo his succesor to lead the gang. Doroteo then adopted the name of his saviour, and continued his criminal activity. With the leadership of the gang secured, Villa decided to join forces with Ignacio Parra, and started his attempts to stop, sometimes violently, the abuses committed by the landlords to the peasants in Chihuahua. In the late 1910 he'd join the Movimiento Maderista, and through cunning and bravery, 'Pancho Villa' reached the higher ranks of the Mexican Revolutionary Army with the nickname 'The Centaur of the North', and even managed to shortly become Governor of Chihuahua. He'd anger the American government in 1916 after attacking the small town of Columbus in New Mexico, which lead to the Punitive Expedition led by John Pershing, who was never able to catch Villa despite all his efforts. Villa has since then played a major role in the Revolutionary army and Mexico's politics. He is a respected member of the General staff, although he's been seen lately dabbling more on politics than learning military strategy.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Agrarista."
ARMY_MEX_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 25, 1877, in Guaynas, Sonora, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Francisco Plutarco Elías Campuzano, born in an accomodated landlord family, graduated as a teacher in 1894 and dedicated to his teaching profession in Hermosillo and Guaynas, while trying to administrate the family business. When he moved to Agua Prieta, Governor José María Maytorena named him deputy. After the Decena Trágica, Calles began recruiting men from Agua Prieta to oppose Victoriano Huerta and in 1913 would join up the revolutionary forces to fight. Calles ended up under the direct orders of Alvaró Obregon, and became colonel and commander of Hermosillo by late 1913. In October of 1914, Calles successfully defended the city of Naco for three months, managing to hold against all odds, and due to this he was turned into Brigadier General by February 1915. With the success of the Plan de Agua Prieta and Obregon's rise to power, Calles became his second in command, and would become a vital member of the staff for years to come, although he has been seen dabbling more into politics in the recent years.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario.\n-He has a very strict moral standard, and he sees both alcohol and religion as dangerous for the mind of both his soldiers and his people."
ARMY_MEX_JUAN_G_CABRAL_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 3, 1883, in Minas Prietas, Sonora, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Juan German Cabral worked as miner before reaching his twenties, where he moved to Cananea, taking part of the 1906 general strike, where he met his future contacts for the Mexican Revolution. He was one of the first revolutionaries to take up arms against Porfirio Diaz and took part in several of the early battles of the revolution. In May 1911, he took Cananea and Naco, and due to this he was ascended to Cavalry Colonel by Francisco Madero himself. He would become Commander in February 1912, and in 1913 he'd join Victoriano Huerta's forces. He'd be then selected to carry out low risk operations and was generally chosen as military governor by Obregón as a more conciliatory man than his colleagues like Maytorena and Callés. He has since then taken part in several diplomatic missions to other South American countries, and remains a very respected member of the staff, even being known as 'The cleanest military man from the revolution'\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Apathetic to Politics."
ARMY_MEX_PABLO_QUIROGA_ESCAMILLA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 7, 1875, in Cienaga de Flores, Nuevo León, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§W Pablo Quiroga Escamilla incorporated into the constitutionalist army in 1913, and was under the orders of Manuel M. Diéguez. With the Volunteer corp and the 13th Battalion of Lancers, Escamilla lead several expeditions in Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. He assisted in the Battle of Santa Ros, the siege of Guaymas and fight for Oredáin. He was promoted to colonel in 1914, taking part in another series of operations in Silao y Trinidad, Guanajuato, Queretaro and Durango. In 1915 he was promoted to Brigadier General, and would take part in another 25 expeditions throughout the revolution and in the post-revolutionary era. While an experienced member of the general staff, he has been slowly but surely losing interest in his military career, and may be willing to resign soon enough."

He was initially under the command of Gertrudis G. Sanchéz, but would continually switch sides during the revolution until joining the Army of Operations under the command of Álvaro Obregón. He was commendated for bravery at the Battle of Celaya. In 1916, he fought in Morelos and in Mexico City against the Zapatist forces, executing several civilians under the fear that they were gonna betray Obregon's troops. In 1918, he operated in Durango and Chihuahua against the Villistas, and in 1920 he joined the Plan de Agua Prieta, which catapulted him to the rank of Brigadier General. Since then he has been named Headmaster of military education at the Heroico Colegio Militar, and he has held his post since then, encouraging discipline and technical expertise over raw manpower, and propagated sports and cultural activities through popular libraries in the barracks.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His relations with both Zapata and Villa are sour at best. Fighting against them in the revolution have made Joaquin very wary of his new colleagues."

tram.intro.t:0 "Transamur - Provisional Russian State in Vladivostok"
tram.intro.d:0 "Siberia and the Russian Far East had been a major area of conflict during the Russian Civil War, as the location of a short-lived democratic republic, the rising of the 'Czech Legion' and Japanese intervention. While forced to evacuate their forces due to German pressure (as well as intense resistance from local Cossacks), the Japanese remained eager to extend their influence and in 1922 pushed for the establishment of an independent state in the Transamur region. This motion gained the support of the Vladivostok business community, despite the fact that it left them vulnerable to forming an economic dependency on Japan. The majority of the business community however saw economic and diplomatic relations with the rising power in the East as a significant advantage, especially when compared to the alternative of being sucked further into the disorder besetting the rest of Russia. The new nation gained a prominent figurehead in the form of Admiral Kolchak, one of the more successful White Generals of the civil war and the one-time self-proclaimed 'Supreme Ruler of All Russia', who had been forced to flee Russia following his unsuccessful attempt to seize control in 1925. In 1936, the Transamur Republic has become a corporate and militaristic state, and is politically, economically and militarily under the thumb of the Japanese Empire. And yet Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"
tram.intro.a:0 "Interesting..."

tram.1.t:0 "Transamur Breaks Away!"
tram.1.d:0 "The Transamur Republic has taken great offence at our attempts to regulate their internal affairs, and are severing all political ties with us!"
tram.1.a:0 "Destroy them!"
tram.1.b:0 "We can only let them go..."

tram.6.t:0 "Panic in Siberia!"
tram.6.d:0 "The Russian government has proven itself unable to maintain the security of its Siberian territories. We have received word that many local leaders want to secede and join Transamur! There may be international complications but we may never get another opportunity like this!"
tram.6.a:0 "Claim the land up to Lake Baikal!"
tram.6.b:0 "Ask the Japanese Empire for permission."
tram.6.c:0 "This is a bit risky..."

tram.7.t:0 "Transamur's Ambitions in Siberia"
tram.7.d:0 "The growing instability in Russia has been viewed by the leadership of Transamur as an excellent opportunity to finally take control over Eastern Siberia. An official diplomatic representative from Transamur has come to us seeking permission to use force against Russia if they resist their rightful demands regarding Siberia."
tram.7.a:0 "Give them the green light."
tram.7.b:0 "Russia will remain untouched!"

tram.8.t:0 "Japan Accepts Our Siberian Claims"
tram.8.d:0 "The Japanese government have accepted our proposal and given us a green light to seize the Russian Far East from the illegitimate Russian regime."
tram.8.a:0 "Great!"

tram.9.t:0 "Japan Rejects Our Siberian Claims"
tram.9.d:0 "The Japanese government have rejected our proposal."
tram.9.a:0 "Damn! Maybe, we are not ready yet."
tram.9.b:0 "Enough of this! Declare independence!"

tram.10.t:0 "Panic in Siberia!"
tram.10.d:0 "The Soviet government has proven itself unable to maintain the security of its Siberian territories. We have received word that many local leaders want to secede and join Transamur! There may be international complications but we may never get another opportunity like this!"
tram.10.a:0 "Claim the land up to Lake Baikal!"
tram.10.b:0 "Ask the Japanese Empire for permission."
tram.10.c:0 "This is a bit risky..."

tram.11.t:0 "Transamur's Ambitions in Siberia"
tram.11.d:0 "The growing instability in Soviet Russia has been viewed by the leadership of Transamur as an excellent opportunity to finally take control over Eastern Siberia. An official diplomatic representative from Transamur has come to us seeking permission to use force against Russia if they resist their rightful demands regarding Siberia."
tram.11.a:0 "Give them the green light."
tram.11.b:0 "The People's land will remain untouched!"

tram.12.t:0 "Japan Accepts Plans for Siberian Intervention"
tram.12.d:0 "The Japanese government have accepted our proposal and given us a green light to seize the Russian Far East from the Soviets."
tram.12.a:0 "Great!"

tram.21.t:0 "Transamur Invades the Far-East!"
tram.21.d:0 "Transamur has taken advantage of the unrest in Siberia to establish its control over the region. While this is a great infringement on our sovereignty we are currently very weak and may not be able to win a war to reclaim our lands, especially since fighting Transamur may mean fighting Japan as well."
tram.21.a:0 "It is useless to fight over an icy wasteland."
tram.21.b:0 "Come and take it then - who believe in such ruse anyway?"
tram.21.c:0 "What!? Siberia shall always belong to Russia!"

tram.22.t:0 "Transamur Invades the Far-East!"
tram.22.d:0 "Transamur has taken advantage of the unrest in Siberia to establish its control over the region. While this is a great infringement on our sovereignty, we are currently very weak in the Far East and can not hope to win a war to reclaim our lands, especially since we are still caught up in a deadly civil war."
tram.22.a:0 "Damn it!"

tram.23.t:0 "Russia Refuses to Intervene"
tram.23.d:0 "The so-called "Russian Government" have seemingly accepted the fait accompli in Siberia, and have taken no serious military action against our liberation effort."
tram.23.a:0 "A smart choice."

tram.24.t:0 "Russia Responses with Force!"
tram.24.d:0 "The so-called 'Russian Government' have not only refused to give up our rightful lands. Moreover, they have declared war on us and aim to retake Vladivostok."
tram.24.a:0 "War it is then!"

tram.25.t:0 "Reds Purge in the Russian Far East"
tram.25.d:0 "The new-established Soviet regime in Western Russia has shown that it is too weak to control areas distant from its urban heartland. Our troops have successfully seized the Russian Far East from them, purging what little influence they held in the region."
tram.25.a:0 "We shall suffer no leftists in our rightful territory."

tram.26.t:0 "Russia Refuses to Cede the Far-East"
tram.26.d:0 "It appears that although the illegitimate Russian regime recognises our efforts to seize control of Siberia they have refused to withdraw their forces and allow the region to fall into our hands. It appears that we must now make a decision on whether to continue the invasion and risk open war."
tram.26.a:0 "War will solve our disputes!"
tram.26.b:0 "We are not ready for conflict."

tram.42.t:0 "Transamurian Expansion in Siberia"
tram.42.d:0 "Our client state, the Transamur Republic, has established its control over several parts of Siberia. While this is a fine addition to the Co-Prosperity Sphere it is possible that Transamur is becoming too powerful and needs to be restrained."
tram.42.a:0 "Demand Kamchatka and Okhotsk!"
tram.42.b:0 "It is good to have strong client states!"
tram.42.c:0 "[TRM.GetLeader] is too greedy for his own good, it is time to replace him."

tram.47.t:0 "Japan Demands Bases"
tram.47.d:0 "The Japanese have congratulated us on our seizure of Siberia but the Representative of the Mikado states that we should allow Japan to administer Kamchatka and allow them to establish a naval base in the Sea of Okhotsk."
tram.47.a:0 "Yes, we still need Japanese protection."
tram.47.b:0 "It is time to throw off the Japanese yoke!"

tram.48.t:0 "Japan Plots a Coup Against [TRM.GetLeader]!"
tram.48.d:0 "The Japanese believe [TRM.GetLeader] has outlived his usefulness and have approached the elite of Transamur with the plan of backing a coup d'etat to replace him with a more compliant council of business and military leaders."
tram.48.a:0 "Yes, [TRM.GetLeader] should be removed!"
tram.48.b:0 "[TRM.GetLeader] will not go anywhere!"

tram.49.t:0 "Transamur Submits"
tram.49.d:0 "[TRM.GetLeader] has decided to submit and kneel before us. Now, there is an empty office of the Vladivostok governorship, and so we shall find a replacement. There are several available options: Sergei Wojciechowski, Kolchak's right hand. He knows how to suppress the people, but his expansionist vision, almost like of a certain rogue admiral, could be problematic. On the other hand, former Transamur leader, Sergey Semyonov, could return to his work again. A content Cossack ataman, he would be unlikely to cause serious problems. There is also potentially the choice of the General Yui Mitsue who once was in command of Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. An old man deserving of a proper retirement, rule in Transamur would be a good fit for him. Still, several liberal ministers have been suggesting that we should establish a new democratic regime in Transamur instead."
tram.49.a:0 "General Mitsue, you have a new order."
tram.49.b:0 "This Wojciechowski knows how to rule the people."
tram.49.c:0 "Humble servants like Semyonov are always welcome."
tram.49.e:0 "A new Transamur Republic shall rise!"

tram.50.t:0 "A New Order in Transamur"
tram.50.d:0 "The Japanese have decided that [TRM.GetLeader] should now guide us. We have no choice but to submit to their will."
tram.50.a:0 "We are even more dependent now!"

tram.56.t:0 "Panic in Siberia!"
tram.56.d:0 "The Russian government has proven itself unable to maintain the security of its Siberian territories. We have received word that many local leaders want to secede and join Transamur! There may be international complications but we may never get another opportunity like this!"
tram.56.a:0 "Claim Lake Baikal!"
tram.56.b:0 "Ask the Japanese Empire for permission."
tram.56.c:0 "This is a bit risky..."

tram.57.t:0 "Transamur Requests Permission to Seize Irkutsk"
tram.57.d:0 "The growing instability in Siberia was viewed by the leadership of Transamur as an excellent opportunity to finally seize Irkutsk. An official diplomatic representative from Transamur has come to us seeking permission to use force against Russia if they resist their rightful demands regarding this city."
tram.57.a:0 "Give them the green light."
tram.57.b:0 "Irkutsk will remain untouched!"

tram.58.t:0 "Japan Accepts Plans for Irkutsk Intervention"
tram.58.d:0 "The Japanese government have accepted our proposal and given us a green light to seize Irkutsk."
tram.58.a:0 "Great!"

tram.59.t:0 "Transamur Invades Irkutsk!"
tram.59.d:0 "Transamur has sent troops and political specialists into Irkutsk, asserting their claim to leadership over the eastern parts of our state. What shall we do?"
tram.59.a:0 "Let them take this."
tram.59.b:0 "No, this is our land!"

tram.60.t:0 "Russia Refuses to Intervene"
tram.60.d:0 "The so-called "Russian Government" have seemingly accepted the fait accompli in Siberia, and have taken no serious military action against our liberation effort."
tram.60.a:0 "A smart choice."

tram.61.t:0 "Panic in Siberia!"
tram.61.d:0 "The Soviet government has proven itself unable to maintain the security of its Siberian territories. We have received word that many local leaders want to secede and join Transamur! There may be international complications but we may never get another opportunity like this!"
tram.61.a:0 "Claim Lake Baikal!"
tram.61.b:0 "Ask the Japanese Empire for permission."
tram.61.c:0 "This is a bit risky..."

tram.62.t:0 "Transamur Ambitions in Siberia"

An official diplomatic representative from Transamur has come to us seeking permission to use force against Soviets if they resist their rightful demands regarding Irkutsk."

tram.63.t:0 "Japan Accepts Plans for Irkutsk Intervention"
tram.63.d:0 "The Japanese government have accepted our proposal and given us a green light to seize the Russian Far East."
tram.63.a:0 "Great!"

tram.64.t:0 "Transamur Invades Irkutsk!"
tram.64.d:0 "Transamur has sent troops and political specialists into Irkutsk, asserting their claim to leadership over the eastern parts of our state. What shall we do?"
tram.64.a:0 "Let them take this."
tram.64.b:0 "No, this is our land!"

tram.65.t:0 "Soviet Russia Submits"
tram.65.d:0 "The newly-established Soviet regime has shown its weakness. They have decided not to intervene in the Russian Far-East allowing us to retake our rightful land."
tram.65.a:0 "A smart choice."

tram.67.t:0 "Transamur Attempts to Break Free"
tram.67.d:0 "With the recent reconquest of Siberia by Transamur they have become much bolder, trying to forge their own way under the sun. Recently they have moved their capital from Vladivostok to more remote parts of their republic, a clear attempt to minimise our influence. What shall we do?"
tram.67.a:0 "It is good to have strong allies!"
tram.67.b:0 "Try to restore our influence over Transamur!"

tram.68.t:0 "Japan Demands Our Submission!"
tram.68.d:0 "The Japanese feel threatened by our attempts to minimise their influence over our country and they have issued an ultimatum to us in which they demand the cessation of steps threatening their sphere of prosperity."
tram.68.a:0 "Submit before Japan."
tram.68.b:0 "Never!"

tram.80.t:0 "Anti-Kolchak Coup"
tram.80.d:0 "The opposition have started an open revolt against us. Disloyal generals and soldiers, lead by Sergei Wojciechowski, have captured the most important neighbourhoods and now marching right to us. Those who are still loyal to Admiral Kolchak are ready to fight with these filthy traitors."
tram.80.a:0 "Kolchak's guards manage to defeat the rebels."
tram.80.b:0 "The Japanese garrison intervenes."
tram.80.c:0 "Kolchak gets overthrown."
tram.80.e:0 "In the chaos the Mladorossi seize power!"

tram.81.t:0 "Kolchak is Overthrown!"
tram.81.d:0 "Alexander Kolchak, leader of Transamur for more than 12 years, has been overthrown by members of the general staff led by Sergei Wojciechowski and executed by a firing squad. His death opens the field for various possibilities of political change in Transamur including the declaration of a republic, if Sergei Wojciechowski and his staff allows it."
tram.81.a:0 "Sergei Wojciechowski is the new leader of Transamur!"
tram.81.b:0 "A Republic is founded."

tram.84.t:0 "Anti-Kolchak Coup in Transamur!"
tram.84.d:0 "Admiral Kolchak, the long term leader of the Transamur state has been overthrown and assassinated by members of his own general staff. This was used by the democratic opposition to gain control over the state, effectively turning Transamur from a military junta into a democracy. How shall we react?"
tram.84.a:0 "Demand the restoration of a military cabinet!"
tram.84.b:0 "Congratulate the new government!"

tram.86.t:0 "The Duma Elections"
tram.86.d:0 "After several months of preparations the provisional government has completed the arrangements for the first free election in Transamur since 1920. There are 90 seats in national assembly available and various political parties have begun their campaigns. Currently only three parties have a chance of gaining a majority, thus forming a new government. Which one shall prevail?"
tram.86.a:0 "The People's Far East Party!"
tram.86.b:0 "The Party of Popular Freedom!"
tram.86.c:0 "The Zemski Krai Party!"
tram.86.e:0 "The army shall put an end to this chaotic democracy!"

tram.87.t:0 "The Duma Elections"
tram.87.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every four years. The state Duma's term has expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament. There are 90 seats in the Duma available and various political parties have begun their campaigns. Only three parties have a chance of gaining the majority, thus forming a new government. Which one shall prevail?"
tram.87.a:0 "The People's Far East Party!"
tram.87.b:0 "The Party of Popular Freedom!"
tram.87.c:0 "The Zemski Krai Party!"
tram.87.e:0 "The army shall put an end to this chaotic democracy!"

tram.90.t:0 "Yui Mitsui Dies"
tram.90.d:0 "Today, our colonial governor, General Yui Mitsui has died at the age of 79. A number of Japanese loyalists and toadies in the Vladivostok Duma have already called for the direct integration of our country into Japan, becoming a new prefecture of the Empire. However, their words are nothing but meaningless prattle. Everything depends on what Japan will decide to do with us."
tram.90.a:0 "Does it mean we are no longer independent?"

tram.91.t:0 "Yui Mitsui Dies"
tram.91.d:0 "Today, our governor in Transamur, general Yui Mitsuei died at the age of 79. Pro-Japanese politicians in Vladivostok Duma have called for Transamur to be made a new prefecture of our empire. Shall we accept their proposal?"
tram.91.a:0 "Indeed, integrate them."
tram.91.b:0 "Far too costly. Transamur will remain loyal under Semyonov."

tram.92.t:0 "Propose Reunification with Russia?"
tram.92.d:0 "With our chances of overcoming the might of Japan being slim, there have been calls from a number of leading figures within Transamur to set aside our previous rivalry with Russia and join them in order to stave off the Japanese threat. By proposing to join the Russian state peacefully, we could finally end years of isolation imposed on us by Kolchak's belligerence and hopefully avoid subjugation at the hands of Tokyo."
tram.92.a:0 "We must ensure our own survival. Send the proposal."
tram.92.b:0 "Are you crazy?"

tram.93.t:0 "Transamur Proposes Reunification"
tram.93.d:0 "It seems that the traitors in Transamur have finally realised the folly of their actions. Their miserable rump state is at war with Japan and they assuredly have no chance of victory in the face of Japanese military power. Representatives from Transamur have come to us begging us peacefully rejoin our nation, presumably in the hopes of avoiding conquest by Japan. Vladivostok is an important port, no doubt, but, are we ready to confront Tokyo yet?"
tram.93.a:0 "Welcome home Russians."
tram.93.b:0 "It's too risky..."

tram.94.t:0 "Transamur Reunifies with Russia"
tram.94.d:0 "It appears that the traitorous scum in Transamur have managed to temporarily escape their inevitable conquest by reunifying with Russia. Our pride demands retribution for their betrayal, but, is it wise to strike at Russia right now?"
tram.94.a:0 "To war!"
tram.94.b:0 "Transamur isn't worth it."

tram.95.t:0 "Russia Refuses Unification"
tram.95.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to join Russia, negotiations have failed, with the Russian representatives refusing to countenance our peaceful reunification. With vast Japanese forces arrayed against us, it seems that we are on our own."
tram.95.a:0 "Damn."

tram.96.t:0 "Disaster"
tram.96.d:0 "The so-called "Soviet Government" have refused to return our lands. Moreover, they have declared war on us and eager to retake Vladivostok."
tram.96.a:0 "Damn!"

tram.97.t:0 "The Russian Republic Breaks Away!"
tram.97.d:0 "The Russian Republic has decided to leave our sphere of influence and cease all contact with us! Our elaborate military-industrial stranglehold over them and their fetid regime lies in ruins, and it appears that our carefully laid plains for increasing our influence in the Russian Far-East are in tatters."
tram.97.a:0 "Destroy them!"
tram.97.b:0 "We can do nothing, for now."

tram.98.t:0 "Attempted Coup in Transamur"
tram.98.d:0 "News about anti-Kolchak coup in Transamur has recently reached us. It appears that rebels sought to kill Alexander Kolchak, our de-facto puppet leader of the Vladivostok regime, but their best efforts seem to have come to nothing, with the putsch crushed by loyalist guards. Still, Kolchak has made a number of enemies in Transamur and his vulnerability is becoming increasingly clear. Perhaps we should demand that Kolchak resign and assign a new, more pliant leader for Transamur."
tram.98.a:0 "Replace him."
tram.98.e:0 "Kolchak may be a loose cannon, but he's our loose cannon."

tram.100.t:0 "Admiral Kolchak Murdered in Transamur"
tram.100.d:0 "News about anti-Kolchak coup in Transamur has recently reached us. It appears that rebels have successfully killed Alexander Kolchak, our de-facto puppet leader of the Vladivostok regime, and General Wojciechowski has become the new dictator. Although he is less brave and ambitious than his former political rival, Wojciechowski still has great expansionist vision for Transamur. Perhaps we should replace him before he starts a geopolitical crisis?"
tram.100.a:0 "Wojciechowski is the best choice for us."

tram.102.t:0 "Admiral Kolchak Murdered in Transamur"
tram.102.d:0 "The leader of the 1925 coup, rogue admiral Alexander Kolchak was recently killed by his own soldiers during a military coup in his beloved Transamur state. A man of great ambitions, he had contested our rights to rule the Russian Republic until his last breath. With his death, our society become a bit more pacified."
tram.102.a:0 "So, the bastard is gone. Excellent!"

tram.103.t:0 "Transamurian Currency in Harbin"
tram.103.d:0 "Harbin is an important city, placed in the middle of Fengtian's territory, and connects two parts of the Chinese Eastern Railway which our republic sold to the Fengtian government in 1927. But even now lots of the Russians live there and play a significant role in the railway. Since many of them have bonds with us, they prefer to use the more or less stable Transamurian Ruble instead of the fluctuating Fengtian Tael, though its unclear if the transactions with our currency are legal or not. Our Economic Minister has proposed that we should make an agreement with Fengtian, which will allow the usage of the Transamurian Ruble in Harbin, but will permit additional taxation by the Fengtian Government."
tram.103.a:0 "Let's propose it!"
tram.103.b:0 "The current situation is acceptable."

tram.104.t:0 "Transamurian Currency in Harbin"
tram.104.d:0 "Transamur has proposed that we allow transactions between our own currency and the Transamurian Ruble in Harbin, which has the largest Russian population in the whole of the Northeast. The government in Vladivostok says that we will be able to tax these transactions, moreover such an agreement could have a positive influence the industrial development of the city as well as the region, where the local Russian business started to make various investments. But, some members of our government mention that the free use of the Transamurian Ruble can lead to the increase of Harbin's autonomy."
tram.104.a:0 "An agreement will help our economy."
tram.104.b:0 "We don't need this deal."

tram.105.t:0 "Fengtian Accepts"
tram.105.d:0 "The Fengtian Government has agreed to allow the usage of our currency in Harbin. We hope that it will strengthen the economic bonds between our countries."
tram.105.a:0 "Excellent."

tram.106.t:0 "Attacking the Petrograd Regime"
tram.106.d:0 "Too long we've been waiting for a chance to liberate our fellow Russians from the tyranny of corrupted German lapdogs and Bolshevik utopists. Our boys are ready to fight, guns are loaded, and trucks are fuelled. Should we officially declare war on them?"
tram.106.a:0 "To arms!"
tram.106.b:0 "We need another month to prepare an invasion."
tram.106.c:0 "We need another half-year to prepare an invasion."
tram.106.e:0 "We need another year to prepare an invasion."

tram.108.t:0 "Setbacks Against Transamur"
tram.108.d:0 "It seems that we have underestimated our enemies in Vladivostok. Their forces are rolling over Eastern Siberia defeating our troops and capturing the cities. Perhaps it would be wise to consider ceding the lands that they have claimed in exchange for peace between us?"
tram.108.a:0 "They're just wastelands anyway..."
tram.108.b:0 "No! It's just a temporary setback."

tram.109.t:0 "Russia Proposes Peace"
tram.109.d:0 "Our mighty military forces are rolling over Eastern Siberia, liberating cities and people from oppression. These cowards who dare to call themselves the Russian government appear to be willing to cede the lands we previously demanded from them. Should we sign a peace treaty or take advantage of Russian military weakness by continuing the war?"
tram.109.a:0 "A reasonable deal."
tram.109.b:0 "There are no treaties with traitors!"

tram.110.t:0 "Treaty of Irkutsk"
tram.110.d:0 "with the regime in Transamur appearing to reciprocate our overtures for peace, it seems that the conflict is now over. Our forces are evacuating from the ceded lands in the Russian Far-East, leaving Vladivostok in control of large areas of our country. While this is a humiliating setback, there is peace - for now at least."
tram.110.a:0 "We have no choice..."

tram.111.t:0 "Transamur Rejects Peace!"
tram.111.d:0 "It appears that the madmen from Transamur are unwilling to stop spilling the blood of Russians. We must defend ourselves!"
tram.111.a:0 "To arms!"

tram.112.t:0 "Setbacks Against Transamur"
tram.112.d:0 "It seems that we have underestimated our enemies in Vladivostok. Their forces are rolling over Siberia defeating our troops and capturing the cities. Perhaps it would be wise to consider ceding the lands that they have claimed in exchange for peace between us?"

tram.115.a:0 "To arms!"

tram.118.t:0 "Anti-Japanese Demonstrations"
tram.118.d:0 "Today, a major anti-Japanese rally was held in Vladivostok. Crowds of angry protesters have demanded that we end our partnership with Japan and expel their powerful delegation from our country. Special agents have already identified the agitators responsible for this demonstration. Though we should be attempting to crush these subversive elements, we could instead use them to reduce Japanese influence in Transamur."
tram.118.a:0 "We can't afford these propagandists."
tram.118.b:0 "They shall be useful stooges against Japanese dominance."

tram.119.t:0 "Japan Demands Transamur Control"
tram.119.d:0 "With Japanese influence growing every day, we can barely control the country. Today, the Imperial Delegation from Tokyo demanded that the leadership of Transamur resign and allow them to rule the Transamur, a harsh insult indeed. Though doing so would incur the wrath of the powerful Japanese military, we currently still have the opportunity to expel the Delegation and declare our total independence from Japan. The proud people of Transamur are not mere serfs and if we are going to die, we shall die defending our country from this naked imperialism!"
tram.119.a:0 "On the other hand, we can avoid a meaningless bloodshed..."
tram.119.b:0 "We are not their minions! To arms!"

tram.120.t:0 "A Second in Command"
tram.120.d:0 "An entire week has passed since the assassination of Kolchak and the successful military coup. Now, with the political atmosphere somewhat cooler, the opportunity has finally come for Wojciechowski to choose a deputy to help rule his military cabinet. There are three candidates for this post: the current head of government General Semyonov; young and ambitious general Pepelyaev and conservative Admiral Stark. Though fresh blood may gives us a new opportunities, serious ideological differences exist between Wojciechowski and the more liberal Pepelyaev and Stark will potentially lead to tensions later."
tram.120.a:0 "Grigoriy Semyenov will stay in his office."
tram.120.b:0 "Anatoliy Pepelyaev, some fresh blood..."
tram.120.c:0 "Georgiy Stark, a renowned Admiral..."

tram.121.t:0 "White Refugees in Vladivostok"
tram.121.d:0 "After their victory in the Second Russian Civil war, the Reds have begun to terrorise their internal enemies. Many former White forces and their supporters have managed to flee from mainland Russia to join our cause against the Bolsheviks taking advantage of a period of instability and anarchy in Siberia to flee east. Along with soldiers, several well-educated officers have arrived offering their services. No matter their prior political affiliations, together we must strike at the Red Hydra!"
tram.121.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers!"

tram.147.d:0 "The history of the "Young Russian" movement is inexorably tied to its leader, the charismatic aristocrat Alexander Lvovich Kazmbek, born in 1902 to a wealthy noble family of Azeri and Iranian origin. The three ideological phases of the Mladorossi can be closely mapped to Kazmbek's own life and experience; unsurprisingly considering his role as orator and ideologist. As a student activist, Kazmbek helped form the "Union of Young Russia" in 1923. Uniting 29 organisations and 4,000 people, the Young Russians represented the monarchist youth wing. Prone to intellectualism and ideologically vague, its members jointly rejected reactionary Tsarism in favour of a "new and dynamic vision". As secretary, Kazmbek met with Professor Nikolai Ustryalov, once head of the press bureau under Admiral Kolchak. Ustryalov convinced the young aristocrat to throw his support behind the putsch against President Kerensky in 1924. Both fled to Transamur following the coup's failure, taking their respective supporters along with them. Ustryalov became disillusioned with the White movement, and began idolising the Bolsheviks as defenders of Russian sovereignty.\n\nThe formation of the "Union of Young Russians" in 1925 marked the second ideological phase of the Mladorossi. Kazmbek began formulating his thesis of the "Labor Monarchy" under Ustryalov's tutelage. The nascent ideology of the Mladorossi combined an absolute monarchy, Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". During this period of 1925-1933, most Mladorossi were united only by theatrical oath-swearing ceremonies and readership of journals such as "Vivacity!" and "Towards Young Russia". The third phase occurred shortly after Kazmbek's travels to the Syndicalist nations of Europe. Kazmbek was particularly inspired by the proto-Totalism of the French & Italian national syndicalists, as well as the British Mosleyites. On his return, Kazmbek formed the "Mladoross Party" in 1934 as its "Vozhd". His ideas on how to organise the Young Russian State have coalesced into a single-party corporatist model under a Worker-Monarch.\n\nWith a strict party structure and growing paramilitary wing, Kazmbek hopes to achieve control of Transamur, and then his beloved homeland, Russia."

tram.148.d:0 "The All-Russian Nationalist Movement, or as they're commonly referred to, the Natsionalisty, are an ultranationalist political organization who in recent years have become increasingly popular among the citizens on Transamur. Formed in 1931 by local politician and staunch Kolchak loyalist, Konstantin Rodzaevsky, the Natsionalisty have found support amongst Manchurian Russians and monarchist exiles. Young emigres still loyal to the ideals of a Russian Tsardom have flocked to this movement in awe of Rodzaevsky’s fiery speeches denouncing Bolshevism, Kerensky and Western Capitalism. All of which he accuses of degenerating the Russian people whilst declaring loyalty to Admiral Kolchak, the Russian Orthodox Church and a restored Tsardom. Espousing the homegrown ideology of “True Russian Nationalism”, the Natsionalisty have organised its members into a paramilitary force known as the, Black Vanguard, undoubtedly a reference to the Black Hundred.\n\n The Black Vanguard have provided security to Kolchak’s regime and have engaged in rounding up political dissidents as well as prominent members of the Jewish Vladivostok community accused of promoting ''dangerous foreign ideologies''. Admiral Kolchak has allowed for these actions to take place without officially endorsing the movements, perhaps to appease the Japanese authorities wary of an anti-foreign movement."

This move has proved to many that the Mladorossi is nothing but a joke and has greatly damaged our legitimacy in the eyes of the Russian people. But, Kazmbek still holds out hope that a Romanov Claimant will approach us and let us crown him Tsar. However, one positive is that Kazmbek’s position has never been stronger, as there is no Tsar that reigns technically above him; even though the Tsar would hold little real power. However, for now the People’s Tsardom of Transamur will have to remain a Tsardom in name only."

TRM_JAP_INF_TRADE_desc:0 "The Vladivostok regime has become hopelessly reliant on the Japanese Empire, and the tendrils of imperial influence dominate many institutions and aspects of Transamurian society.

TRM_JAP_DEP_1_desc:0 "Our relationship with the Japanese Empire is slowly moving from that of a mutually beneficial partnership, ostensibly at least, to one that bears all the hallmarks of a serious trade imbalance."
TRM_JAP_DEP_2:0 "Increased Dependence on Japan"
TRM_JAP_DEP_2_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly clear to many that our dependence on the Empire of Japan is growing by the day. Ships arrive from Tokyo laden with goods and leave Vladivostok port with empty holds. We have become little more than a market."
TRM_JAP_DEP_3:0 "Extreme Dependence on Japan"
TRM_JAP_DEP_3_desc:0 "Few seriously dispute that our nation is little more than a Japanese lapdog at this point, and the Transamur regime's weakness has gone from an open secret to a blatant fact."

TRM_goods:0 "Welfare State"

TRM_Navy_Old_Ways_desc:0 "A lot of time has passed since the end of the Weltkrieg. Naval thought has changed and new technologies such as carriers and submarines have experienced much development.

TRM_Navy_Cruiser:0 "Develop Cruisers"
TRM_Navy_Cruiser_desc:0 "We are not ready to construct big battleships, so it would be wise to focus on smaller ships such as cruisers. They are one of the keys to naval domination and a worthy initial goal for our fleet."

TRM_Navy_DD:0 "Destroyers of Amur"

TRM_Jap_Inv3:0 "Invite Japanese Instructors"
TRM_Jap_Inv3_desc:0 "While Japanese aid and investment has been highly lucrative, our economy is laughably inefficient compared to that of the land of the rising sun.

TRM_Feng_Dip_desc:0 "The Fengtian regime is also under a great deal of Japanese influence, and thus our ally. Despite this and our close geographic proximity, our nation has diplomatic and economic ties comparable to that of any other with Fengtian.

TRM_Feng_Workforce:0 "Invite Fengtian Workers"
TRM_Feng_Workforce_desc:0 "To the west lie the vast lands of Manchuria ruled by Zhang Zuolin who is our occasional partner and ally. A lot of poor Chinese people are willing to work for us, even for a mere bowl of rice per day.

TRM_Feng_Smugglers:0 "Smuggle Weapons From Triads"
TRM_Feng_Smugglers_desc:0 "Permanent instability in Asia creates good conditions for various smugglers and other criminals. As we need weapons to fight, we'll get it from every possible source.

TRM_Kolchak_Mil:0 "Vladivostok Arsenals"
TRM_Kolchak_Mil_desc:0 "The world is entering an era of global crisis and war unlike any seen in history, even including the Weltkrieg. This war will no doubt test our spirits, so we must be prepared. We must expand our facilities to produce even more equipment."

TRM_Kolchak_Doc:0 "Supreme Ruler"
TRM_Kolchak_Doc_desc:0 "Kolchak claims himself to be the "Supreme Ruler of Russia". For our leader to bolster his image, he needs a strong propaganda machine to help foster an effective cult of personality. Everyone should know about his glorious persona and great deeds. Kolchak must be seen as Father of the Nation in the eyes of his people."

TRM_Yui_Focus_desc:0 "The Japanese have never been welcomed in Transamur. The news that Transamur is to be directly administered from Tokyo by General Mitsue has shocked many in Vladivostok and has caused great consternation amongst many fierce nationalists. It will take a long time and great effort to legitimise this new 'lapdog' regime in the eyes of the people."

TRM_Yui_Jap:0 "Begin Japanisation"
TRM_Yui_Jap_desc:0 "Now that our puppet regime stands on more solid ground, the time has come to take the first steps toward Japanisation of the whole region. A first wave of Japanese colonists has already arrived - made up of teachers, doctors and engineers; their qualifications will help us significantly."

TRM_Yui_Fac:0 "Invite Japanese Workers"

TRM_Pol_Research:0 "Major Education Reform"
TRM_Pol_Research_desc:0 "No matter if it is a dictatorship or a democracy, the aspects regarding education are clear in both cases. No men or women ever won a war, but science did. We must invest as much as possible to give our scientists everything they want."

TRM_Integrate_Bai_desc:0 "Conquering a piece of land is one thing. To make its inhabitants accept you is another thing entirely. It will take us some time to bring order to the Baikal region but if we are successful, we could even declare ourselves a true Far Eastern Republic, displaying our increased strength and dedication to final victory over the illegitimate regime in Petrograd."

### Leaders & Traits ###

POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_TRM_DESC: "By the Grace of God, We, Kirill I, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias, Tsar of Siberia; all of the northern countries Master; and others, and others, and others."
POLITICS_KAZEMBEK_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gFebruary 15th, 1902, in Kazan, Kazan Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Little would have predicted that Alexander Kazembek would end up in the position he is in today. It seems as if his life may just be a lesson on the instability of the universe; of the chaos of politics and human existence. Born to a noble Iranian-Azerbaijani family, Kazembek saw the brunt of the Russian Revolution; something that undoubtably shaped his eccentric political views. However, instead of turning him against the Soviets, the Revolution endeared in him a certain level of respect for the Soviet System. And even though the Red Revolution failed; Kazembek still incorporated parts of the Soviet Ideals into his personal politics. \n\n His charisma and experience as an orator put him at the forefront of the new “Young Russia” group, a group that rejected Reactionary Tsarism in favour of a “New and Dynamic Vision”. As the situation in Russia deteriorated, Professor Nikolai Ustryalov convinced Party Secretary Kazembek to side with Alexander Kolchak and his coup against the Petrograd Government. Kolchak’s coup however failed; resulting in the creation of the state of Transamur; the rump state where Kazembek and Ustryalov fled to. These series of events led to Ustryalov and Kazembek rejecting the ideology of the Whites in favour of the Bolsheviks. This idealization lead to the development of the concept of a “Labour Monarchy”, and a system that combines Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". And as his Ideology grew and Changed, so did the influence of the Mladorossi within Transamur. Their influence grew and expanded, to a point where they could seize power following the Anti- Kolchak Coup. \n\n Now, Kazembek stands as the “Vozd” of the Rump State of Transamur. And though his influence may be currently small, Kazembek has plans to restore the Tsar, and soon reclaim all of Russia."
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_MLAD_DESC: "Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, now Kirill I of Russia, is one of the most troublesome members of the House of Romanov. Strong-willed, ambitious, and determined to seize the throne, he has caused a headache to his first cousin, Nikolay II, several times. It is an open secret that during the February Revolution, Kirill actively worked against the Tsar and the rest of the House, even to the point where he ordered his men to raise the red flag above Petrograd - not because of any dedication to revolutionary ideals, but because of the hopes that he would become regent, or possibly even Tsar, after his cousin's abdication. \n\nAfter the execution of Nikolay and his family, Kirill claimed his rule over the scattered house of Romanov, a claim which was hotly contested by the rest of the family, who claimed that Kirill had no right to a restored Russian throne nor to lead the Russian royal family. By 1929, however, he was ultimately recognized, the untimely death of Grand Duke Nikolay certainly helped. While Kirill begrudgingly pays lip service to the Mladorossi, it truly doesn't matter to him who holds the keys to power; as long as he is in charge in some form. Even if Kirill is under practical house arrest, and not but a powerless figurehead compared to Vozhd."
POLITICS_ALEXANDR_KOLCHAK_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 16th, 1874, in Aleksandrovskoye, St. Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Once a polar explorer and commander in the Imperial Russian Navy, who had also fought in both the Russo-Japanese War and the Weltkrieg, Kolchak is now the self-proclaimed "Supreme Ruler of Russia" in a puppet quasi-state in the Far East, unsuccessfully trying to throw off the shackles of Japanese imperialism. How did he come to such a life?\n\nWhen the civil war was raging in the vast expanses of Russia, Kolchak, in many ways suddenly for himself, was proclaimed the Supreme Ruler of Russia during the putsch in November 1918. Having first arrested the SRS and declared martial law, the imminent catastrophe was stopped by Boris Savinkov, who agreed with Kolchak on the adoption of the SR agrarian reform. The Whites were united and strong. The Siberian army soon merged with other white armies and by the end of 1919 the Bolsheviks surrendered. Having made a difficult choice in favor of Russia, Kolchak made an equally difficult choice, renouncing the supreme power and approving the Second Constituent Assembly in 1920.\n\nHowever, his relations with the newly created Russian Republic's government were quite hostile due to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which they had agreed to and signed, the Japanese Intervention in Transamur and Eastern Karelian Revolt. These relations only worsened in 1925 after Kolchak's unsuccessful coup d'etat against the government of Kerensky's "German lapdogs". The rogue admiral managed to escape from Russia and, ironically, found refuge in the pro-Japanese state of Transamur, the power in which belonged to the Kwantung army and the richest Merkulov family. Having enlisted the support of the ataman of the Transbaikal Cossacks Semenov and the East Siberian Oblastniks, as well as the support of Tokyo, Kolchak again found himself in the chair of the Supreme Ruler, but this time with a clear goal - to finish what he had started and overthrow the Petrograd regime."
POLITICS_SHUMYATSKY_DESC: "Boris Shumyatsky's parents were forced into exile in Siberia because they refused to leave their home. This incident has stuck with Shumyatsky, continually reminding him of the corruption within the Tsarist government based in Petrograd. A former Bolshevik, Shumyatsky was forced to leave Russia upon the conclusion of the Russian Civil War and has become an influential politician within Transamur. Despite his political views shifting towards the right, Shumyatsky continues to pursue the goal of turning Transamur into a welfare state. His past experience as a Bolshevik agitator has helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_MERKULOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §g1870, in Blagoveshchensk, Amur Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! A former leader of the pro-Japanese Provisional Transamur Government, Merkulov and his brother are the richest people in Transamur. Now, as Kolchak no longer stands in his way and democracy has finally returned to Vladivostok, Merkulov, a son of a humble peasant, is eager to lead Transamur to prosperity. His vast and personal connections with the people have helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_WOJ_DESC: "A leader of Czechoslovakian Legion and hero of the Russian Civil War, Wojciechowski has refused to accept the Brest-Litovsk treaty as legitimate. Outraged, he ceased all the contact with the government of the Russian Republic, and left for Transamur where he found many supporters. Formerly the right-hand man of admiral Kolchak, Sergei betrayed and killed his 'friend'. Less aggressive and ambitious than the rogue admiral, and a hardened veteran, Wojciechowski is now ready to advance West."
POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gSeptember 25th, 1890, in Kuranzha, Transbaikal Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! An Ataman of the Baikal Cossacks, Semyonov and his boys had managed to establish a Transabaikal state, currently known as Transamur, in order to fight Bolsheviks who had been agitating in the Russian Far East. His newborn country was soon subjugated by Japan. When Kolchak's coup in 1925 had failed and the had rogue admiral had left Russia for Transamur, Semyonov was forced to resign and continue his career as military commander. However, the 'father-of-state' has managed to return, politically influential. Semyonov's only goal is to see Transamur prosper and, in order to do so, he is unwilling to wage uncertain wars."
POLITICS_YUI_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 27th, 1860 in Kōchi, Tosa Domain, Empire of Japan\n§YPolitical Career:§! An old general, Mitsue is familiar with taking on command as he'd led the Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. A honourable war hero, he has been granted the ultimate gift from the emperor; to peacefully rule over the lands he'd conquered so many years ago. The old man is an isolationist and does not seek to wage any sort of war. With him assuming power as head of Transamur, the dream of a Greater Transamur has died."
POLITICS_MIKHAIL_DITERIKHS: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gApril 17th, 1874 in St. Petersburg, St. Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gMikhail Diterikhs, a hereditary soldier and head of the local ROVS, was known for his extravagant views on the structure of society. Views that he has consistently promoted for decades. A convinced monarchist and supporter of autocracy, Diterikhs sees Russia's salvation in a new Zemsky Sobor, and sees himself as a promoter of traditional Russian Orthodoxy and monarchism. Wishing to divide the state into church parishes as units of self-government, Diterikhs dreams of building a truly Orthodox Russia.§!"
POLITICS_MIKHAIL_DITERIKHS_GENERAL: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gApril 17th, 1874 in St. Petersburg, St. Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gMikhail Diterikhs was born into a family of an artillery colonel and a noblewoman. From birth, he was destined for a military career. He received a good military education and served in various staff positions until the Russo-Japanese War began. During the war, he participated in significant battles such as Mukden and the Shaho River. Later, he was appointed as the head of a department in the Mobilization Division of the General Staff Main Directorate. In this position, he experienced the beginning of the Weltkrieg. During the war years, he served as Chief of Staff of the 3rd Army. In early September 1916, he traveled from Arkhangelsk to Salonika to support the Serbian army. Under his leadership, Bulgarian army units were defeated, resulting in the Allies occupying the city of Monastir on November 19. However, that marked the end of the military successes. After the February Revolution, he was summoned back to Russia and appointed as the head of the headquarters of the Special Petrograd Army. In November 1917, he relocated to Ukraine, where he became the Chief of Staff of the Czechoslovak Corps in March 1918. He traveled with them to Vladivostok. He supported Alexander Kolchak and was appointed as the head of the commission to investigate the murder of the royal family on January 17, 1919. During the final years of the Civil War, Diterikhs held multiple positions including commander of the Siberian Army, commander of the Eastern Front, and chief of staff for Supreme Commander-in-Chief Kolchak. He also played a key role in establishing volunteer formations in the summer and fall of 1919, which were based on the defense of faith. These included the Orthodox 'Druzhinas of the Holy Cross' and the Muslim 'Druzhinas of the Green Banner'.\n\nDuring Kolchak's putsch, Diterikhs supported his former ally and remained in the Far East as the head of the Far Eastern branch of the ROVS. He became one of the leaders of the Siberian Army, unlike many monarchists who remained loyal to Petrograd.§!"
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_KAPPEL_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gApril 28th, 1883, in Tsarskoye Selo, St. Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gVladimir Kappel hails from a noble family of military officers and thus decided to follow the steps of his father, even though he perished in battle when he was still a child. Though educated as a cavalry officer, he graduated with a report how the cavalry is growing obsolete in the face of motorized forces. He served dutifully in the Weltkrieg and participated in the Brusilov Offensive, but his attitude changed when the February Revolution broke out. An avowed monarchist, Kappel remained silent at first, hoping for a restoration of the Romanov order once the situation stabilizes, but soon began to plot with other future White generals. When the Bolsheviks seized power, he was in Perm, and travelled to Samara in order to join the People's Army of Komuch, a republican socialist force which avowed to restore the Constituent Assembly - a monarchist leading a socialist force was a sight to see. \n\nKappel performed his duties with spectacular results - he showed his skill as a calculating tactician and an expert at winter warfare, which allowed him to rout Bolshevik forces several times larger with little difficulty. Bolshevik newspapers even dubbed him "little Napoleon" - the nickname which stuck, however, was "Soldier-General" - a commander who always stayed by his men and fought side by side with a rifle and grenade. After the end of the Bolshevik uprising, Kappel remained in the army and became one of the most important generals in its infantry corps, though soon he decided to join the Kolchak Putsch and found himself in the Far-East. He is a proponent of army motorization and officer corps modernization."

TRM_totalist_party: "Mladorossi"
TRM_totalist_party_long: "Mladorosskaya Partiya\n§LYoung Russia Party§!\n§gThe history of the "Young Russian" movement is inexorably tied to its leader, the charismatic aristocrat Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek, born in 1902 to a wealthy noble family of Azeri and Iranian origin. The three ideological phases of the Mladorossi can be closely mapped to Kazem-Bek's own life and experience; unsurprisingly considering his role as orator and ideologist. As a student activist, Kazem-Bek helped form the "Union of Young Russia" in 1923. Uniting 29 organisations and 4,000 people, the Young Russians represented the monarchist youth wing. Prone to intellectualism and ideologically vague, its members jointly rejected reactionary Tsarism in favour of a "new and dynamic vision". As secretary, Kazem-Bek met with Professor Nikolai Ustryalov, once head of the press bureau under Admiral Kolchak. Ustryalov convinced the young aristocrat to throw his support behind the putsch against President Kerensky in 1924. Both fled to Transamur following the coup's failure, taking their respective supporters along with them. Ustryalov became disillusioned with the White movement, and began idolising the Bolsheviks as defenders of Russian sovereignty.\n\nThe formation of the "Union of Young Russians" in 1925 marked the second ideological phase of the Mladorossi. Kazem-Bek began formulating his thesis of the "Labor Monarchy" under Ustryalov's tutelage. The nascent ideology of the Mladorossi combined an absolute monarchy, Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". During this period of 1925-1933, most Mladorossi were united only by theatrical oath-swearing ceremonies and readership of journals such as "Vivacity!" and "Towards Young Russia". The third phase occurred shortly after Kazem-Bek's travels to the Syndicalist nations of Europe. Kazem-Bek was particularly inspired by the proto-Totalism of the French & Italian national syndicalists, as well as the British Mosleyites. On his return, Kazem-Bek formed the "Mladoross Party" in 1934 as its "Vozhd".§!"

However, many delegates remained in Siberia and lay low, including the first chairman of the presidium, Boris Shumyatsky, who was granted amnesty after the end of the Civil War.

Young emigres still loyal to the ideals of a Russian Tsardom have flocked to this movement in awe of Vonsyatsky’s fiery speeches denouncing Bolshevism, Kerensky and Western Capitalism. All of which he accuses of degenerating the Russian people whilst declaring loyalty to Admiral Kolchak, the Russian Orthodox Church and a restored Tsardom. Espousing the homegrown ideology of “True Russian Nationalism”, the Natsionalisty have organised its members into a paramilitary force known as the, Black Vanguard, undoubtedly a reference to the Black Hundred.\n\nThe Black Vanguard have provided security to Kolchak’s regime and have engaged in rounding up political dissidents as well as prominent members of the Jewish Vladivostok community accused of promoting ''dangerous foreign ideologies''.

### Events ###
tram.intro.t: "Transamur - Provisional Russian State in Vladivostok"
tram.intro.d: "Siberia and the Russian Far East had been a major area of conflict during the Russian Civil War, as the location of a short-lived democratic republic, the rising of the 'Czech Legion' and Japanese intervention. While forced to evacuate their forces due to German pressure (as well as intense resistance from local Cossacks), the Japanese remained eager to extend their influence and in 1922 pushed for the establishment of an independent state in the Transamur region. This motion gained the support of the Vladivostok business community, despite the fact that it left them vulnerable to forming an economic dependency on Japan. The majority of the business community however saw economic and diplomatic relations with the rising power in the East as a significant advantage, especially when compared to the alternative of being sucked further into the disorder besetting the rest of Russia. The new nation gained a prominent figurehead in the form of Admiral Kolchak, one of the most successful White Generals of the civil war and the one-time self-proclaimed 'Supreme Ruler of All Russia', who had been forced to flee Russia following his unsuccessful attempt to seize control in 1925.\n\nIn 1936, the Transamur Republic has become a corporate and militaristic state, highly tied economically to Japanese Empire. And yet Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"
tram.intro.a: "Interesting..."
tram.intro.b: "Tell me more about Transamur Politics"

tram.999.t: "The Oblastniki - Siberian Regionalists"
tram.999.d: "Siberian Regionalism is a political movement to form an autonomous Siberia. Firstly developed in the 19th century by Siberian students, it gained huge popularity during the Russian Civil War with the creation of the Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia. However, the Provisional Siberian Government sacrificed own independence for the sake of consolidation of all possible forces to fight with Bolsheviks.\n\nDuring the rule of Kerensky, though Russia was stated as a federative republic, President has continuosly blocked all resolutions about giving wider autonomy to Siberia and it is still an undeveloped region.\n\nWhile the majority of the Siberia is under control of the Petrograd Regime, most of the Oblastniks, both leftist and rightist have support their former ally - Admiral Kolchak in the putsch as he promised wide autonomy to Siberia and he even invited a prominent Oblastnik - Pyotr Vologodsky to become a prime-minister.\n\nIn 1936 they are still waiting for Kolchak to finally unite Russia under his rule and proclaim Siberian Autonomy. Their resistance increases with their popularity and if it is high enough they can even attempt to overthrow Kolchak."

tram.998.t: "The Japanese Business Interests in Transamur"
tram.998.d: "The Japanese Empire has a huge influence on our country - they were the ones that intervened in the Far-East during the Russian Civil War and expanded their influence in the Transamur Region. In 1922 an independent nation was formed in Vladivostok, supported by local business community. However, everything changed, when in 1925 Kolchak tried to coup the Russian government and was forced to flee to Transamur, supported by Oblastniki and Transbaikal Cossacks.\n\nFinding himself in a partially-recognized state with only ally, Kolchak has nothing to do but establish even stronger economic ties with the Japanese Empire. While formally Transamur is independent, Japanese has a free military access to our territory and provide us with supplies. Our dependence on Japan varies proportionally with the popularity of the Japanese Delegation. If their influence becomes too high, they will try to establish full control over our country."

tram.997.t: "Vladivostok Business Community"
tram.997.d: "The business circles of Vladivostok-namely, the Merkulov Brothers, and other, smaller businessmen, were the basis of Transamur when this state was first proclaimed. Although in 1925 they did not become part of the Kolchak Council of Ministers, in fact, all foreign trade is based on them. Under their control, together with the Kwantung Army, is the port of Vladivostok. This situation allows the Merkulovs to get rich, the Japanese garrison to receive corrupt bribes, and Kolchak can only silently watch the rampant crime. With each visit of the Japanese delegation, the business community is becoming more and more focused on trade with Japan. And it seems that this state of affairs will remain unchanged until Kolchak decides to finally break all ties with the Japanese Empire."

tram.996.t: "DO-ROVS - Siberian Monarchists"
tram.996.d: "General Diterikhs is a convinced monarchist, whose ideas are sometimes even too radical. Disappointed in the decision of the constituent assembly to establish a Republic and not return the tsar to the throne, Diterikhs soon joined Kolchak's putsch in 1925 and ended up in Transamur with him.\n\nHere he founded the so-called 'Far Eastern Branch of the Russian All-Military Union' and settled in Nikolayevsk, where a camp of his 'Crusaders' has been created. In addition, Diterikhs also established military control over the Trans-Siberian Railway near the Rukhlovo station, where the railway connects Primorye with Transbaikalia and Yakutia.\n\nDiterikhs is still more or less loyal to the Admiral, as he hopes that the Supreme Ruler will restore the Monarchy as soon as he takes Moscow. Nobody knows why Diterikhs is so sure of this, but Kolchak should be careful, because if the DO-ROVS is not loyal to the Supreme Ruler, anything can be expected from them."

tram.995.t: "Ataman Semyonov and the Cossacks"
tram.995.d: "Ataman Semyonov is an extraordinary person. Fluent in Buryat and Mongolian, Semyonov has surrounded himself with loyal people and has his own interests in the Far Eastern region. The ataman of the Transbaikal Cossacks, the marching ataman of the Amur and Ussuri Cossacks, Semyonov is the main representative of the interests of the Cossacks in Transamur. Despite the fact that he supported Admiral Kolchak both during the civil war and during the coup, his real intentions are unknown. According to rumors, his Cossack troops are supplied with Japanese weapons.\n\nAt the moment, Semyonov is actually waging a war with the remnants of Bolshevism - the partisans of the NRA, and despite the fact that he supports the oblasts and Buryat autonomists, he is engaged in power struggle with them for power in Transbaikalia. It is not known how loyal the Cossacks are to Kolchak, but the Supreme Ruler knows one thing for sure - you can expect anything from them."

tram.994.t: "NRA - The Last Stronghold of Bolshevism"
tram.994.d: "The Far Eastern People's Revolutionary Army is all that remains of the Red Army in the Far East, if these partisans can be called an army at all. General Blucher, their leader, is undoubtedly a coward. Having been defeated by the Siberian Army, he deserted and hid in the Siberian taiga. Surprisingly, somehow, the partisan movement in Transbaikalia was able to survive until our days. Perhaps the slave conditions of the workers in Chita and Khabarovsk contributed to this, but now the NRA are isolated partisans scattered across Transbaikalia, agitating for a return to Bolshevism. Leading an underground struggle and arranging sabotage, this movement must be destroyed."

tram.993.t: "Disobedient Inorodtsy"
tram.993.d: "The Inorodtsy, literally meaning \"of different origin\" is a special ethnicity-based category of population that receives a special treatment under the law. Relations between the non-Russian population of our country and the government are strained to say the least. Following the Omsk Coup in 1918, national autonomies were abolished and only restored in a significantly truncated form at the insistence of liberal and conservative representatives in the Constituent Assembly. Although they did receive autonomy, it was not in the form that they had desired.\n\nUnder the administration of Admiral Kolchak, autonomy for the Yakuts and Buryats across the Far East was once again significantly restricted. The Buryat-Mongol Burnatskom and the Yakut Regional People's Administration continue to exist, but clearly oppose the authority of the central government.\n\nCurrently, the situation in these areas is quite tense with various acts of sabotage and unrest occurring from time to time.

In 1916 the cooperative opened its own sausage production in order to "improve the quality and price". Cooperative sausage was on sale in February 1917, which immediately reduced the price in private shops by 20 kopecks per pound, and soon private producers were also forced to improve their quality following the cooperative.\n\nHowever, already at the end of 1918 an underground NRA committee was established in Verkhneudinsk. And since then, it is believed that it was thanks to it that the NRA coordinated its subversive actions in the Transbaikalia.

The Kolchak government tolerated him only because of his high patrons from Tokyo, because he was the main conduit of Japanese influence and thanks to him Japan supplied us with various things we needed, be it food or various kinds of weapons. Although these supplies were useful, they made Tranamur more and more dependent on Japan. But now the time has come for us to sever all our ties with the Japanese imperialists, who only want to profit from our country's resources, and to secure this \"treaty\" for severing relations, we will sign it with the blood of the ataman and his cronies.

The generals say that the NRA is a red underdog and must be treated accordingly, and finally to finish off this last splinter of Red October. On the other hand, there are voices saying that the NRA consists of not only Bolsheviks but also Socialist-Revolutionaries and, taking into consideration Pepelyaev's own views, he could find a common language with that part of the NRA and smash the rest of the Bolsheviks.

Others say that the monarchists are the main breeding ground of reaction and, playing on Pepelyaev's feelings, argue that they are in favor of restoring the old serf landlord system, and therefore we should not cooperate with them, but suppress them by all the means we can.

Therefore, we must nationalize it, or our government will come to an end.\n\n- This argument gets us nowhere, so I propose a compromise, so as not to turn away all the big industrialists, then let's nationalize only the military industry? Understand, we need their help, so let's go with that option, okay?\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of reflection, Anatoly said:"

tram.113.a: "A reasonable deal."
tram.113.b: "There are no treaties with traitors!"

tram.114.t: "Treaty of Novosibirsk"
tram.114.d: "With the regime in Transamur appearing to reciprocate our overtures for peace, it seems that the conflict is now over. Our forces are evacuating from the ceded lands in Siberia, leaving Vladivostok in control of large areas of our country. While this is a humiliating setback, there is peace - for now at least."
tram.114.a: "We have no choice..."

tram.115.t: "Transamur Rejects Peace!"
tram.115.d: "It appears that the madmen from Transamur are unwilling to stop spilling the blood of Russians. We must defend ourselves!"
tram.115.a: "To arms!"

tram.118.t: "Anti-Japanese Demonstrations"
tram.118.d: "Today, a major anti-Japanese rally was held in Vladivostok. Crowds of angry protesters have demanded that we end our partnership with Japan and expel their powerful delegation from our country. Special agents have already identified the agitators responsible for this demonstration. Though we should be attempting to crush these subversive elements, we could instead use them to reduce Japanese influence in Transamur."
tram.118.a: "We can't afford these propagandists."
tram.118.b: "They shall be useful stooges against Japanese dominance."

tram.119.t: "Japan Demands Transamur Control"
tram.119.d: "With Japanese influence growing every day, we can barely control the country. Today, the Imperial Delegation from Tokyo demanded that the leadership of Transamur resign and allow them to rule the Transamur, a harsh insult indeed. Though doing so would incur the wrath of the powerful Japanese military, we currently still have the opportunity to expel the Delegation and declare our total independence from Japan. The proud people of Transamur are not mere serfs and if we are going to die, we shall die defending our country from this naked imperialism!"
tram.119.a: "On the other hand, we can avoid a meaningless bloodshed..."
tram.119.b: "We are not their minions! To arms!"

tram.120.t: "A Second in Command"
tram.120.d: "An entire week has passed since the assassination of Kolchak and the successful military coup. Now, with the political atmosphere somewhat cooler, the opportunity has finally come for Wojciechowski to choose a deputy to help rule his military cabinet. There are three candidates for this post: the current head of government General Semyonov; young and ambitious general Pepelyaev and conservative Admiral Stark. Though fresh blood may gives us a new opportunities, serious ideological differences exist between Wojciechowski and the more liberal Pepelyaev and Stark will potentially lead to tensions later."

tram.121.d: "After their victory in the Second Russian Civil war, the Reds have begun to terrorise their internal enemies. Many former White forces and their supporters have managed to flee from mainland Russia to join our cause against the Bolsheviks taking advantage of a period of instability and anarchy in Siberia to flee east. Along with soldiers, several well-educated officers have arrived offering their services. No matter their prior political affiliations, together we must strike at the Red Hydra!"
tram.121.a: "Welcome home, brothers!"

tram.122.t: "More Exiles Arrive in Transamur"
tram.122.d: "A long period of political instability in mainland Russia has caused anarchy to erupt in distant parts of Siberia. With the [RUS.Capital.GetName] regime otherwise occupied containing instability in the West, it is quite difficult for them to exert real power over this region. People are losing hope in their leaders and fleeing to our country. More and more refugees and exiles are joining our cause."
tram.122.a: "Welcome home, brothers!"

tram.123.t: "Send Agitators into Siberia"
tram.123.d: "With the death of Kerensky the political situation in Russia proper is more chaotic than it has been even in recent years. Some of our ministers believe that the opportunity now exists for us to strike again. We should start with sending agents to push our agenda all across the Eastern Siberia. If the people hear us it is inevitable that they will join with us to bring down the corrupt regime in the West."
tram.123.a: "Send the agitators."
tram.123.b: "It's too risky."

tram.124.t: "Results of our Agitation Efforts"
tram.124.goodagit: "Recent reports have reached us making clear that our plan to send agitators into Siberia to spread our ideas was even more effective than we had predicted before. A number of people, many of them armed and military trained, left their homes for our host. We now have enough additional manpower for a good division."
tram.124.agit: "Recent reports have reached us making clear that our plan to send agitators into Siberia to spread our ideas was effective. A number of people, several of them armed, left their homes for our host. We now have enough additional manpower to reinforce existing divisions."
tram.124.badagit: "Recent reports have reached us making clear that our plan to send agitators into Siberia to spread our ideas was ineffective. The people of Siberia, no matter the anarchy taking hold in the country, seem unwilling to abandon their lives and join us for such a hopeless dream. It seems that we have wasted resources for nothing."

tram.125.d: "News of the death of George V, the king-in-exile of the United Kingdom has recently reached the Vladivostok. Once Kolchak's ally, the monarch guaranteed his safety in 1925 until the British Revolution. His son, [CAN_king_first_name] has now ascended to the throne in Canada. Although, neither Kolchak or [CAN_king_first_name] know each other personally, this resetting of relations could be the start of a long period of partnership between our countries. We should send an envoy to negotiate for support."
tram.125.a: "Strong allies are always good."

tram.126.t: "Envoy from Transamur"
tram.126.d: "Today an envoy from the petty military junta of Transamur has come to visit His Majesty, [CAN_king_full_name]. In his speech, the envoy informed us about King George V's previous support of Kolchak's 1925 unsuccessful coup in Petrograd and assured us that this time the rogue admiral will triumph - however, he once again requests support from the Entente. We owe Kolchak nothing, but maybe he's not that useless? How should we answer?"
tram.126.a: "Assure him that he'll get everything he need."
tram.126.b: "Limited support will be enough."

tram.127.fullsupport: "Our envoy has returned with magnificent news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed a deep respect for our cause. The King has promised that we can rely on him for some degree of military support. It seems that the Entente is now an effective partner for our regime."
tram.127.partialsupport: "Our envoy has returned with good news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed a respect for our cause. However, though the King has promised to partially support us, he has refused to give us complete backing. While the outcome is not as great as we had previously hoped, some support from the Entente is most welcome."
tram.127.nosupport: "Our envoy has returned with unfortunate news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed little interest in our cause, to put it mildly. The King said bluntly that we are nothing but a clique of buffoons desperately trying to preserve our rule. He promised absolutely nothing from the Entente and our relationships has definitely worsened."
tram.127.a: "Destination, [RUS.Capital.GetName]!"
tram.127.b: "It's better than nothing!"
tram.127.c: "What a rude person..."

tram.128.t: "Vladivostok Treaty"
tram.128.d: "The war between Japan and Transamur seems to lose any reason it had before. Japanese troops, taking casualties form brave Russian defenders, were unable to conquer Vladivostok for so long time the entire perspective of taming Transamur may now cost more than Transamur can possibly give in return.\n\n[JAP.GetLeader] and [TRM.GetLeader] meets today in Vladivostok to sign a white peace treaty and end all hostilities between these two countries. It seems that Japan has lost its only tool to press Russia. People of Transamur are celebrating this outstanding victory."

tram.128.jap: "Curse you, traitors."

tram.145.t: "A Changing Attitude"

tram.147.t: "The Oblastniki Issue"
tram.147.d: "The Oblastniki are demanding more and more from our government. At first, they demanded their own local committees, than local Dumas, now they are asking for local governors. Their influence - and, therefore, resistance is growing from day to day. But we give them what the Russian Republic never did - the widest autonomy. There are many of Oblastniki in the Council of Ministers, lobbying the separatist influences. Perhaps, we should finally start to limit this pathetic movement?"
tram.147.a: "They better calm down with their demands."

tram.1481.t: "A New Cabinet"
tram.1481.d.kolchaksurvivedthecoup: "Some of the ministers in the government allowed the coup to happen. Kolchak strongly believes that this situation has only happened because of his promises and insufficient rigidity. The new Council of Supreme Ruler will be formed now, and now almost every political organisation is considered to be a threat."

tram.148.a: "Transamur will be free of socialism."

tram.149.t: "Our Relations With the Japanese"
tram.149.d: "From the foundation of our state, Japan was our closest ally. While Kolchak considers current state of relations with Japanese a temporary and necessary measure to be strong, he understands that this position may be considered vulnerable and make his rule illegitimate in the eyes of common Russians. Nevertheless, we need this ties for now and it seems that we will have to cope with the Japanese influence until the Siberian Army enters Moscow."

tram.1491.t: "Down With The Japanese Influence!"
tram.1491.d: "From the foundation of our state, Japan was our closest ally. However, things have changed. The influence of the Japan is becoming more and more overwhelming which make us vulnerable. We must make the right choice once and for all: either we join the Japanese officially or completely cut ties with them."

tram.150.d: "The Transamurian Government has decided to cut ties with us. They sent our delegation back, stopped the trade and are issuing that we should expel our garrisons. While Transamur is becoming stronger and stronger, we should take it back by force - now or never."

tram.152.t: "The Russian Far-Eastern Orthodox Church"
tram.152.d: "After the Kolchak's putsch, most of the Far-Eastern churches united to form the Russian Far-Eastern Orthodox Church - they supported reactionary politics of Admiral Kolchak. After his death, with the willingness of Diterikhs to restore the monarchy, the Church is eager to support this decision."

tram.157.d: "After the Coronation of Kirill I, several Russian generals, including most prominent war heroes - Denikin and Wrangel have escaped Russia for Transamur. With them on our side, it will be much easier for us to restore the power of the Romanov House all across the lands of Russian Empire."

tram.158.d: "The movement of Oblastniki, or Siberian Federalists has been tearing apart the Motherland for decades now.

This decision, however, opens new opportunities for us to finally unite with an unrecognized state in the Far-East. On the other hand, if we don't, some monarchist generals can join their government. Chkheidze has delivered a large speech in the Senate, where he theoretically justified that the restoration of Romanov Monarchy is necessary to achieve popular support of our government. He claims that with the Tsar back, our legitimacy can be secured and a long tradition of monarchy will continue.\n\nThe Senate, however, was divided on this issue. The ones stated that we should not move away from the Orthodox Eurasianist doctrine, but the others believed in Chkheidze's theses. With the prospect of peaceful union with the Far East on the line, his proposal is likely to be passed by the majority of the Senate. However, they can also listen to the opinion of Trubetzkoy and other founding fathers, who are unlikely to support Chkheidze."

tram.200.t: "The Supreme Ruler of Russia"
tram.200.d: "Even during the Civil War, when hordes of bloodthirsty Bolsheviks were trying to throw Russia into chaos, Admiral Kolchak made an important and responsible decision - to become the Supreme Ruler of Russia before the convocation of the Constituent Assembly to unite the forces of the Whites in the fight against the Reds.\n\nThe barely maintained peace between the SRs, Kadets, and Military Generals lasted until the end of the war, and in 1920, after driving out the Bolsheviks, Kolchak, then-Prime Minister Sazonov, and Kerensky were forced to sign the Minsk Treaty. After some time, the second Constituent Assembly was convened, and Kolchak resigned from his position as the Supreme Ruler of Russia.\n\nBut the next 5 years changed everything. First, the ongoing Japanese occupation of Transamur, in which local businesses seized power, effectively turning Vladivostok into a Japanese colony. Secondly, the German \"occupation\" of Russian industry, approved by Kerensky in the name of economic prosperity. Third, the rampant left-wing forces, famine in the Volga region, indulgences for the peasants, alienation of the property of the rich.\n\nAll this led to the event known as the Kolchak Putsch of 1925. And now the admiral has once again taken on the furrows of the Supreme Ruler, leading the Russian State in exile, waiting for the chance to return to Moscow and finally restore order in Russia."
tram.200.a: "And now we are here..."

tram.201.t: "The NRA Partisan Warfare"
tram.201.d: "From the very moment when the Whites seized power in Siberia and the Far East, the Far Eastern People's Revolutionary Army (NRA), funded by the Bolsheviks, operated in the region. With the loss of the Bolsheviks, the NRA continued its activities, but completely went underground, periodically arranging political assassinations and attempts on high-ranking officials. 15 years later, the NRA is still active... and either the lack of DO-ROVS agents, or the incompetence of the Transbaikal Cossacks, or the lack of infrastructure, prevents the exposure and destruction of this terrorist group.\n\nIn addition, the NRA also distributes outright Bolshevik propaganda, which tries to radicalize the workers of the large industrial cities of the Far East: Chita, Khabarovsk, etc. We must identify and destroy all the underground branches of the NRA, get their leadership and execute them before they plunge the Far East into the chaos of Bolshevism."
tram.201.a: "The Bolshevism must eventually die out."

tram.202.t: "Merkulov Brothers"
tram.202.d: "Business circles in Vladivostok are the origins of such a state as Transamur. It was they, sponsored by the Japanese government, who declared the Transamur Protectorate. Everything changed in 1925, when the territory of Transamur radically increased, and in Vladivostok, in addition to them and the Japanese, the Siberian Army of Kolchak, the DO-ROVS, the Cossacks and the Siberian Regionalists appeared. Vladivostok, thus being the capital of Transamur, became a chessboard for all political groups of Transamur. And maybe Kolchak thinks that he is in charge here, but this is a mistake.\n\nAt the head of Vladivostok is the Japanese garrison of the Kwantung army, which guards the port of Vladivostok, and without its permission, no goods enter Vladivostok. But permission is very easy to get, especially if you belong to the Merkulov family - the richest entrepreneurs in the Far East. With a pocket Japanese garrison, the Merkulov brothers are trying not only to subdue the entire Vladivostok trade, but also politics with Spiridon Merkulov's National-Democratic Union being one of the largest allowed political parties in the Far-East."
tram.202.a: "Watch them closely..."

tram.205.t: "Help With Fighting NRA?"
tram.205.d: "In war, all means are good, and to finally finish off the Bolshevik infection in the Far East, we can turn to one of the political groups loyal to us. There are only two options: the Semyonov Cossacks, who will easily deal with the partisans in their native lands, or the Diterikhs DO-ROVS-organized and disciplined military, who almost as much hate the Bolsheviks as we do."
tram.205.a: "We will need Semyonov's help"

tram.206.d: "General Diterikhs declared a crusade against Bolshevism. Armed not only with rifles and ammunition, but also with faith in our Savior Jesus Christ, the vigilantes of the Holy Cross are ready to destroy the cursed heresy of Bolshevism.\n\nDestroying any agitation and propaganda of the partisans of the people's Revolutionary Army, the Squads of the Holy Cross bring light to the uneducated masses of the Far East. Long live the new Inquisition! Long live General Diterikhs! Long live Admiral Kolchak!"
tram.206.a: "It seems NRA is doomed."

tram.207.t: "Cossacks, Armed With Japanese Rifles!"
tram.207.d: "The participation of the Transbaikal Cossacks in the suppression of the partisan war of the People's Revolutionary army brought not only good, but also suspicious rumors. Local residents say that the Cossacks who came to liberate them from the oppression of Bolshevism were armed with Japanese rifles, and some columns consisted of Fentian and Japanese officers. Of course, it is quite strange that the Cossacks are quietly walking around in the presence of foreign armed forces,but there is such a question. How can the locals even know what Japanese rifles look like?"
tram.207.a: "At least they fight NRA"

tram.208.t: "Siberian Regional Council"
tram.208.d: "For too long, we have promised to give the oblasts autonomy without doing anything. Not surprisingly, over the years, their discontent grew more and more. It's time to stop making promises and do something about it. We will form the Siberian Regional Council, or Sibsovet, which will be the authorized body of the Supreme Ruler in the lands with civil administration. This body will have supreme executive and legislative power in these regions, which, of course, will be limited only to the Supreme Ruler and the Council of Ministers."
tram.208.a: "Triumph of Siberian Regionalism!"

tram.210.t: "Zemsky Sobor"
tram.210.d: "In the city of Vladivostok, the Great Zemsky Sobor is held, under the leadership of Voivode Mikhail Diterikhs. In the conditions of the fact that our motherland is enslaved by socialist enemies, we are the last stronghold of the Russian people, who keep in their hearts a fervent love for the Dying Motherland!\n\nThe Zemsky Sobor makes the following decision:\n'Letter of the Amur Zemsky Sobor to the Russian People of the Great Russian Land': We call for national unity around the Vladivostok government, so that God will grant a single Sovereign Leader to the great-power Russian Land. We hand over the supreme power to the Romanov dynasty, so be it!\n\nUntil the arrival of the Russian Tsar in Vladivostok and his coronation as the current tsar of All-Siberia and the Tsar of All-Russia in exile, [ROOT.GetLeader], who was previously elected Voivode of the Zemsky Krai and the Zemsky Rat, will serve as regent. For this, the Sobor is concluded."
tram.210.a: "The Tsar Will Return!"

tram.211.t: "Merkulovs In Power"
tram.211.d: "The richest family in Transamur has finally seized power in the country, even through democratic elections. With Spiridon Merkulov as president and Nikolay Merkulov as prime-minister, both of them are looking with greed at restoring the ties with Japan and expanding their business interest. The Merkulovs are looking forward to enriching themselves rather than claiming to be the legitimate Transamur Government. But, perhaps, if they control all of Russia, they will be even more richer and powerful."

tram.212.t: "Supreme Ruler's Announcement"
tram.212.d: "Today, the Supreme Ruler of Russia, Aleksander Kolchak, announced to the Council of Ministers that in the near future he plans to dissolve the Council of Supreme Ruler and form a new government. Not to say that the news was received by the ministers with enthusiasm, as many of them suspected something was wrong. The main and most reasonable suspicions arose, of course, from Prime Minister Vologodsky, despite his long acquaintance and the position of prime minister in the very first Kolchak government during the civil war.\n\nKolchak does not have many options for forming a new government, but one of the key decisions is to remove regional officials from the government and replace them with either more loyal military or Cossacks, or, conversely, to form a government of 'people's trust'."
tram.212.a: "We'll see"

tram.213.t: "Tensions in Vladivostok"
tram.213.d: "Kolchak's statement, despite its seemingly routine in the political sphere, seems to have led to a crisis among ministers, which affected the overall stability of the country. The news about the formation of a new government has raised the ears of the whole of Vladivostok, and people are wondering who will become the new prime minister under the Supreme Ruler. In addition, citizens are afraid of Japan's interference in the decision of Kolchak. Against the background of small popular unrest and a sharp aggravation of distrust of the Supreme Ruler, slogans of free and fair elections are again heard on the streets."
tram.213.a: "Something is happening"

tram.215.t: "A Delegation From [FROM.GetName]"
tram.215.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has sent us a foreign delegation, asking for an official recognition of our state as legitimate Russian government. The regime of the self-proclaimed Supreme Ruler of Russia may seem to us ridiculous, but if we are feeling free to oppose the [219.Owner.GetAdjective] government in Moscow, we can formally recognize [TRM.GetAdjective] as the legitimate one."
tram.215.a: "We should not recognize this Japanese colony..."
tram.215.b: "They will have our recogniton."

tram.2151.t: "[FROM.GetName] Recognized Transamur!"
tram.2151.d: "We have just received the news that the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has treacherously recognized Vladivostok as the legitimate Russian government and opened embassy. We must stand strong against any threats to our legitimacy and act against them!"

tram.2152.a: "What can we do?"

tram.216.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Recognize Us"
tram.216.d: "The cowardly [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to recognize us and has sent our delegation back to Vladivostok. We'll see what will they do when the boots of the Siberian Army march through Moscow."
tram.216.a: "It's not our problems."

tram.217.t: "[FROM.GetName] Recognized Us"
tram.217.d: "A friendly government of [FROM.GetName] has recognized our government as the legitimate Russian government. This will bring a few more points to the Supreme Ruler's legitimacy in the eyes of the world community."

tram.218.t: "The Trials Begin"
tram.218.d: "Our motherland, once again broken, bloodied and weak, and all through the fault of geeks like Kerensky, Milyukov and others, who sold our country to the Germans for the damned Reichsmark. But apart from them, the country is rotten through and through with socialist ideas that literally poison the air, and the army under the leadership of the incompetent Kornilov was simply ruined. It's time to restore order with a firm hand. May a fair and just trial take place!"
tram.218.a: "All rise for the Honorable Chief Justice"

tram.219.t: "Trial of the Bolsheviks"
tram.219.d: "Several dozen people who have been identified by us directly as members or former members of a group of Bolsheviks, also known as Reds, or Communists, are being tried in the case of a coup d'etat and an attempted coup d'etat. Some of them were not caught or managed to leave the border while the Siberian Army stormed Moscow, but some of the defendants could not escape a fair trial. So, the defendants in the case, Bukharin N. I., Zhukov G. K., Spiridonova M. A., Rykov A. I., and others, are accused of treason to the Motherland, as well as the creation of several party socialist organizations aimed at establishing the power of workers and peasants, as stated. Nevertheless, in fact, these groups of individuals planned to establish their own sole power, destroy and decompose the army, question and ostracize the patriots of the Motherland who still have honor, dignity and conscience. The court ruled. The guilt of the above-mentioned citizens has been proven, the decision of the court in cases of high treason is not subject to appeal or review. Taking into account the circumstances in the form of plans to overthrow specifically the regime of A. F. Kerensky, who was also declared a criminal posthumously, the court softens the decision and appoints a sentence of life imprisonment to the accused."
tram.219.a: "Fair enough."

tram.220.t: "Trial of the Socialists-Revolutionaries & Mensheviks"
tram.220.d: "The defendants in the case of anti-Russian actions aimed at destroying the state foundations have arrested several high-ranking persons who are somehow connected with A. F. Kerensky and the so-called Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, including V. M. Chernov, N. D. Avksentiev, and others. In addition, the leaders of the RSDLP party, or the so-called Mensheviks, who also took part in the Petrograd regime in one way or another, are also being investigated. Taking into account the past achievements of these politicians, including participation in the suppression of the Bolshevik putsch during the civil war, as well as alienation from the administration of the country by A. F. Kerensky, the court made the following decision. Given the mitigating circumstances, these persons are..."
tram.220.a: "Innocent!"
tram.220.b: "Guilty!"

tram.221.t: "Fate of the PSR & RSDRP"
tram.221.d: "Regardless of the court's decision in the case of the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, the fate of their parties remains open. On the one hand, they should be banned immediately, but it should be taken into account that the RSDLP represents the interests of the working class, and the AKP is one of the largest parties in the country, and their complete ban implies an unstable situation in the country. In addition, the interests of these parties are lobbied by Siberian regional officials, many of whom were directly or are members of these parties. A compromise solution would be to ban these parties, but instead create a pro-government party of workers and peasants, which will definitely not encroach on state power."
tram.221.a: "Ban these two remnants of the past..."
tram.221.b: "Create a new pro-Kolchak party instead."
tram.221.c: "Let them live..."

tram.222.t: "Fate of the KDP"
tram.222.d: "Despite the fact that the liberal party was not distinguished by rabid Russophobia, like the previous ones, its leader, Pavel Milyukov, was prime minister under Kerensky all the years of his reign, that is, in fact, he was the main person who allowed the rampant Germans and corruption in the country, so he should have been arrested and tried as a criminal, despite all his patriotism and whatever he said. The KDP party itself should pass into the hands of... more loyal people, like Viktor Pepelyaev, the leader of the Party of Constitutional Democrats of the Far East. However, maybe we should avoid past mistakes and ban all this rotten movement of liberals?"
tram.222.a: "Arrest Milyukov and make Pepelyaev leader of KDP"

tram.223.t: "Fate of the NRPR"
tram.223.d: "Boris Viktorovich Savinkov... he could become a very useful companion of Kolchak in his difficult path. However, he chose a different path. A former terrorist and a member of the Socialist - Revolutionary Party created his own party, but we must pay tribute to him-he also wanted to overthrow Kerensky as much as Kolchak. His party was opposed to the Germans and against Kerensky, and sought to revive the Russian people. However, he is still a socialist and has great ambitions, and it is at least risky to leave him free."
tram.223.a: "Arrest Savinkov and ban NRPR"
tram.223.b: "Let him live, but ban NRPR"
tram.223.c: "Let them live..."

tram.224.t: "Fate of Lavr Kornilov"
tram.224.d: "Russian generals are people with whom we fought side by side in the civil war, but who betrayed Russia for the sake of German subsidies. General Kornilov is a traitor who ruined the country and the army. Generals Wrangel and Denikin are his accomplices. Unfortunately, the last two managed to escape from the country, but General Kornilov remained, and now he is a defendant at a military tribunal. He is already an old man, so they will not treat him so harshly, and therefore the court sentences him to the highest penalty - execution by firing squad. With the death of General Kornilov, a shameful era in the history of the army will end."
tram.224.a: "An end he deserved."

tram.225.t: "Fate of the Unions"
tram.225.d: "The Petrograd regime under the leadership of the socialist Kerensky was undoubtedly full of various kinds of trade unions, allegedly protecting the rights of workers. In fact, they were hotbeds of socialism, Bolshevism and other anti-Russian heresy. The most important of them was the VTSPS under the leadership of the Menshevik Lozovsky, a traitor to the Motherland. We can completely ban the trade union movement in Russia, so that we no longer face strikes and protests. Another option is to put your people in the highest positions in these trade unions, as well as to de-socialize them so that they meet the interests of the country. Or we can leave everything as it is in the hope that in this way we will earn the trust of the working class."
tram.225.a: "Ban these movements!"

All supreme power belongs to the Supreme Ruler of Russia and the Cabinet of the Council of Ministers appointed by him. In addition, the State Duma will be established, which has legislative functions, but any bill must be approved by the Supreme Ruler of Russia before it is adopted. In addition, the procedure for terminating the powers of the Supreme Ruler of Russia is also established - in the event of a serious illness, death or resignation, the head of the Council of Ministers will take his position until a special meeting is convened, at which a new Supreme Ruler will be elected."

tram.300.d: "Due to our harsh policies towards Yakut people, the local civilian government, known as the Provisionan Yakut Regional People's Administration has declared independence and ceded from our republic. To our great surprise, the current General-Governor of Yakutsk, Innokentiy Smolin, was in Vladivostok with a visit to [ROOT.GetLeader].

It seems that the Victory is so close to us, that we can be sure that we will achieve it very soon. The citizens of liberated Siberian cities have met with trepidation the great soldiers of the Siberian Army, who once again, as in 1918, have marched through their cities."

Even though we have pardoned other Transamur officers, the fate of this particular traitor should be very clear - death."

The Russian Cincinnatus, who made a difficult choice during the civil war, and then again-for the sake of saving the Motherland and opposing Kerenshchina. Perhaps we should spare the admiral if he is willing to give up all claims to the title of Supreme Ruler and continue his naval service, as he has always wanted."

tram.504.d: "Together with the fall of the Far Eastern regime, Japan decided not to run away from our land in disgrace. Instead, it seems they decided to bargain and occupied the port of Vladivostok and the city itself. Despite the fact that their presence there was already there, they reinforced the garrisons and brought a military fleet into the bay."
tram.504.a: "They're going to foot the bill for this!"

tram.505.t: "Peace With Japan?"
tram.505.d: "Seeing the imminent fall of Vladivostok, Japan decided to enter into negotiations with us. In return for ending the war, they demanded that we stay out of Asian affairs."
tram.505.a: "Never!"
tram.505.b: "We need this peace now."

tram.10002.t: "Fate of the Old Russian Influence"
tram.10002.d: "With our rule in the Old Russian Far East being secured day by day, we have been greeted by the prospect of changing the city names from the old Kolchak regime to that of the honorable Chysanthemum Throne. While Japan-izing the Far East may take time, this change will be inevitable. Yet, there are still some in our lands who cherish the tyranny of old from the Russians, and it will undoubtedly anger those who still see themselves as heirs of the true Russia. Shall we make this brash move to further incorporate this land to Tokyo?"
tram.10002.a: "An excellent plan, damn the Russians."
tram.10002.b: "We mustn't act too brashly."

trmnra.1.t: "Blagoveshchensk Uprising"
trmnra.1.d: "The city of Blagoveshchensk is the largest transportation hub and industrial center of the Amur Province. Since yesterday, workers in Blagoveshchensk have been demanding higher wages and shorter working hours. Strikes organized jointly by the People's Revolutionary Army and the Central Siberian Army grew into open disturbances. Urgent measures must be taken to suppress this vicious uprising!"
trmnra.1.a: "The uprising should be suppressed!"

trmnra.2.t: "The People's Revolutionary Army Revolts."
trmnra.2.d: "It became known that General Boguslavsky took the side of the rebels and the division under his command joined the rebels. Moreover, the Blagoveshchensk garrison laid down its arms.\n\nThe Amur Cossacks stationed on the other side of the Zeya River, as well as the remaining loyal units, were cut off from Blagoveshchensk by the blown-up bridges on the Amur and Zeya. "
trmnra.2.a: "Catastrophic!"

trmnra.3.t: "Proclamation of the Far-Eastern People's Republic"
trmnra.3.d: "With the escalation of the conflict in Blagoveshchensk, workers in other major cities - Chita, Khabarovsk, and Vladivostok - also turned against our government. Despite the fact that martial law was declared throughout the Far Eastern Republic, this did not prevent the NRA from arming the self-defense units. The rebel leader, General Kalashnikov, made a statement to overthrow the dictatorship throughout the Far East. Although this statement was untrue, it motivated many peasants to join the uprising. Now power in the major cities has indeed passed to the NRA, but there are still the last pockets of resistance."
trmnra.3.a: "The end of dictatorship!"

trmnra.4.t: "Transbaikal Cossacks Declare Independence!"
trmnra.4.d: "We have definitely underestimated the NRA. Not only is it an armed militia, but they are also professional mercenaries. After Khabarovsk and Chita had fallen under the Red Banner, socialists tried to establish control over Vladivostok. We would have won easily, but the majority of the population seem to be dissatisfied with Kolchak's rule and they are stupid enough to join the bloody socialists. The streets of Vladivostok are now covered in blood."
trmnra.4.a: "Semyonov's bandits should be crushed!"
trmnra.4.b: "We should save Russia from socialist bandits!"

trmnra.6.t: "Admiral Kolchak Murdered"
trmnra.6.d: "Admiral Kolchak has refused to give up. The angry mob forced an entrance into the Kolchak's headquarters and the ultimate fate of the Admiral-Dictator is unknown. We can only imagine what happened to his body, but there is only one fact we know for sure - the NRA has declared the Far-Eastern Socialist Republic."

trmnra.40.d: "The NRA has definitely underestimated us. After workers rose up in Khabarovsk, we shot their leaders. The remaining militia and mercenaries went to Vladivostok in their miserable attempt to overthrow Kolchak, but the Army destroyed them. Soon after, workers in Chita gave up. The Transamur Lives and Marches On with its Supreme Leader - Admiral Kolchak."
trmnra.40.a: "Long Live Admiral Kolchak!"

trmnra.41.t: "Socialist Coup in Transamur"
trmnra.41.d: "One of our main allies - Transamur - has fallen under red banner of someone named Kalashnikov. It is absolutely correct that they will try to cut our economic ties with former Transamurian government. We could intervene directly or do nothing."
trmnra.41.a: "We should watch them closely."


trmnra.7.t: "Anti-Japanese Propaganda"
trmnra.7.d: "The Japanese influenced our country for too long, but there is one thing that Kolchak's corrupt government did not know. We hate Japanese and we want our independence. Moreover, we want independence for all workers that suffered under the Japanese boot."
trmnra.7.a: "Exploitators aren't friends!"

trmnra.8.t: "Destroy Japanese Influence"
trmnra.8.d: "After the Revolution, we seized the means of production and prohibited private property, but it is not enough for destroying the Japanese influence completely. They still have military access to our country and we believe that they are still hoping to reinstall their colonial government. We should do something!"
trmnra.8.a: "Close the borders with Japan, secury our maritime boundary and tear all the treaties."

trmnra.42.t: "Transamur Closed The Border"
trmnra.42.d: "The new socialist government of Transamur has tried to destroy our influence in the region, but they did not think that they are surrounded by sea."
trmnra.42.a: "How dare they, to war!"
trmnra.42.b: "Their pettiness doesn't concern us"
trmnra.42.c: "Naval Embargo their vessels"

trmnra.43.t: "Japanese Naval Blockade"
trmnra.43.d: "After our actions, the Japanese has naval blockaded us. While this will greatly increase our import cost, we should rely on ourselves. They won't break us."
trmnra.43.a: "Stay strong."

trmnra.9.t: "Buryat-Mongolian SR"
trmnra.9.d: "The Region of Transbaikal is not only Semyonov Cossacks' den, but also a land of people who were always oppressed - Buryats. We respect the Buryat workers and we wish that they are free. They need the freedom that they never got from Emperor, Kerensky and Kolchak."
trmnra.9.a: "Promise them autonomy."

trmnra.10.t: "The Land of Buryat-Mongols"
trmnra.10.d: "We understand the pressing need of Buryat workers to become independent, but the region of Transbaikal was for a long time ruled by Ataman Semyonov - anti-Bolshevist scum, Japanese puppet and a coward. We never got him during the Civil War and he's likely to escape when we liberated Chita. But we should greatly increase garrisons at the border with Mongolia."
trmnra.10.a: "You are already liberated!"

trmnra.90.t: "Buryats Demand Autonomy"
trmnra.90.d: "Last week saw an unrest in the region of Buryat-Mongolia. Many workers demanded autonomy we promised them a year ago."
trmnra.90.a: "Suppress the uprising - we are one country."

trmnra.11.t: "Purge The Army"
trmnra.11.d: "Most of the DO-ROVS and Kolchak Clique generals have escaped abroad, but we now that there are some that stayed. We should purge those who won't fight for us and for the freedom of workers."
trmnra.11.a: "Join us or die."

trmnra.12.t: "The Czechoslovak Legion"
trmnra.12.d: "The Czechoslovak Legionnaries are one of the most dangerous organisations, operating in Transamur. Not only they are war heroes, they are also cruel and violent mercenaries. We should expel them from our country."
trmnra.12.a: "We will never forget their uprising during the Civil War."

trmnra.13.t: "Fate of Church"
trmnra.13.d: "The Russian Far-Eastern Orthodox Church has once supported Kolchak and his bourgeois policies. We should execute the priests and blow up churches or burn them to the ground."
trmnra.13.a: "Religion is the opium of the people."

trmnra.14.t: "[TRM.GetNameDef] Wants To Join Us"
trmnra.14.d: "The Far-Eastern Republic has recently fallen under socialist flags, the workers are liberated and the Japanese are expelled. Now they are asking to join us as one nation."
trmnra.14.a: "Welcome home!"

trmnra.16.t: "The Last Bastion of Bolshevism"
trmnra.16.d: "With the defeat of the Reds in the Civil War, the lands of the first socialist republic in the world has been a dangerous zone for socialists. Many of them escaped to France and other socialist nations, but some stayed. Our leader, Vasily Blyukher is one of them. And he will say with pride that the Far-Eastern Republic is the last bastion of the Bolshevism, but not the least.\n\nThis brings up a new discussion, however. Some consider that the Far-Eastern Republic in its current state is the only possible and durable way to prolong Bolshevism. So comrade Blyukher suggest that he should step down and invite either comrade Krasnoschyokov or comrade Nikiforov to lead a civilian government in the Far-East. The second choice, however, is to proclaim Russian Soviet Republic in-exile and try to restore the real Soviet power all across the Russia. The third choice, is to keep Transamur under military rule of Blyukher until further notion..."
trmnra.16.a: "Long Live Comrade Krasnoschyokov!"
trmnra.16.a2: "Congratulate Comrade Nikiforov!"
trmnra.16.b: "Prepare the restoration of Russian Socialism."
trmnra.16.c: "Keep the military government."

trmnra.17.t: "A message from the Far-East."
trmnra.17.d: "The Far-Eastern Republic is asking to join us in a close union - but their leader, comrade Blyukher wishes to stay as the head of state. We respect those who fought against Kolchak and we should probably have a buffer zone between us and Japan."
trmnra.17.a: "Accept the deal."

trmnra.18.t: "`Transamur Has Cut Ties With Us!"
trmnra.18.d: "Transamur has announced today that they will cut ties with our empire and forge a new path, alone. This comes as a shock to many in Japan who view the state of Transamur as one of Japan's foremost colonies and allies. Regardless, we will not take this insult lightly."
trmnra.18.a: "Damn Russians!"

trmnra.19.t: "[SOV.GetNameDef] Funds an Armed Revolt Against Our Government"
trmnra.19.d: "Despite we have crushed the NRA earlier, its leader and many members have left our country. With Soviet power established in Russia, they returned back and now they have massive funds to organize an open revolt."
trmnra.19.a: "They won't do anything against us."
trmnra.19.b: "Declare war first"

trmnra.20.t: "Armed Revolts in Chita and Khabarovsk"
trmnra.20.d: "Large industrial cities of Chita and Khabarovsk once again turned syndicalist and are now trying to coup our government."
trmnra.20.a: "Try to crush them!"

trmnra.21.t: "The Coup Succeeds"
trmnra.21.d: "Unfortunately, there were too many of them. They killed our soldiers and seized administrative buildings in largest cities. [TRM.GetLeader] has been murdered and red banners were hung out. The next day the Soviet forces have crossed the border and established full control of our territories. However, now we shall decide what to do next."
trmnra.21.a: "Join the Big Brother!"
trmnra.21.b: "Request Autonomy!"

trmnra.22.t: "The Coup Failed"
trmnra.22.d: "Unfortunately for NRA, we have crushed them. However, we now may fear that the Soviet government will declare war upon us as it is clear that their puppet was destroyed."
trmnra.22.a: "We will never surrender."

trmnra.23.t: "The NRA Coup Failed"
trmnra.23.d: "The coup we founded in Transamur has failed, the revolutionaries were crushed and now the borders are only much more controlled."
trmnra.23.a: "Crush them!"
trmnra.23.b: "Back down."

trmnra.56.t: "Peasant Unrest"
trmnra.56.d: "The NRA partisans are weakening the stability of our Motherland. Recently, one of them managed to raise a peasant uprising in one of our provinces. Fortunately, the uprising was soon calmed down by our loyal officers, and the rest of peasants escaped home."
trmnra.56.a: "I want the head of the bomber on my desk!"

trmnra.57.t: "Workers' Demonstrations"
trmnra.57.d: "Even though technological advancement resulted in a slow but steady improvement of working conditions, the workers remained very vulnerable to NRA agitation. Demonstrations in cities were organised from time to time, their demands varying depending on who was pulling the strings."
trmnra.57.a: "Oh well..."

trmnra.58.t: "Arms Factory Attacked"
trmnra.58.d: "Just last night there was an explosion at a weapons factory in Blagoveshchensk, which destroyed an entire weapons production line. According to reports from the scene, there were no fatalities, but there were injuries among the workers. None other than the NRA claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming that their attack was aimed at undermining Japan's position in our country. It will take time to rebuild the destroyed industry, but our citizens are getting more and more tired of the violence every day. If we want to regain the support of our people, we must destroy the NRA as soon as possible before they take more drastic measures."
trmnra.58.a: "They will pay for it!"

trmnra.59.t: "Industrial Sabotage"
trmnra.59.d: "This morning Khabarovsk residents woke up to a terrifying sight and sound: a bomb exploded at a factory, killing several people and injuring dozens more. The bomb severely damaged the plant and also damaged local infrastructure. None other than the NRA claimed responsibility for the attack, which claimed that the purpose of the attack was to hit Japanese businesses in the country. Although the response of local firefighters and police is admirable, many locals are extremely alarmed and some even accuse the Far-Eastern government of inaction. There is even a growing murmur that the government's actions in recent days are only provoking the NRA to organize more terrorist attacks. If we want to regain the trust of our people, we must redouble our efforts to show the people that we can protect them!"
trmnra.59.a: "We will prevail!"

trmnra.60.t: "Railway Bombing"
trmnra.60.d: "Residents along the Trans-Siberian Railway woke up to a loud explosion and a cloud of smoke in the middle of the night. Apparently, the NRA terrorists struck quickly in the dark and just as quickly fled into the Siberian forests. The implication of their attack is clear: the rail lines in Siberia play a key supply role, and without them the troops in Transbaikalia would have difficulty with food and ammunition. Although we will send recovery crews to get our trains up and running more quickly, the latest attack reflects the increasingly violent nature of the NRA. We will make sure that when we find them, they pay for their crimes."
trmnra.60.a: "We will catch them!"

trmnra.61.t: "Failed Attack"
trmnra.61.d: "Today the military command in Vladivostok was absolutely delighted when the news of the actual victory reached them. It turns out that in their conceited arrogance the NRA dogs had attempted to raid a small military outpost near Chita in broad daylight. Most likely, they intended to raid the base solely for supplies, since they were on the run and were probably running out of fuel for their so-called rebellion. After a silly strike on the base, the defenders fired from fortified positions and towers littered with sandbags, fighting off NRA forces like fish in a barrel. Finally, after suffering significant losses, the NRA again fled, but not immediately, leaving their wounded and fallen comrades behind. News of the victory reached the streets of every Siberian town, and the military and government praised the response. At last we had a great success, a testament to the strength of our government and the loyalty of our military to [ROOT.GetLeader]!"
trmnra.61.a: "Good riddance."


trmnra.100.t: "Vasily Blyukher Steps Down"
trmnra.100.d: "The Far-Eastern Republic is now the last stronghold of Bolshevism in the world. By achieving this final goal of restoring Soviet power, we are now facing a much stronger enemy to the West. That is why Vasily Blyukher has decided to step down as the leader. He says that all the power are now delegated to..."
trmnra.100.a: "...the Bolsheviks, returned from exile."
trmnra.100.b: "...Frunze"
trmnra.100.c: "...Tukhachevsky"

trmnra.101.t: "Attacking the Petrograd Regime"
trmnra.101.d: "Too long we've been waiting for a chance to liberate our fellow Russians from the tyranny of corrupted German lapdogs and Reactionaries. Our boys are ready to fight, guns are loaded, and trucks are fuelled. Should we officially declare war on them?"
trmnra.101.a: "To arms!"
trmnra.101.b: "We need another month to prepare an invasion."
trmnra.101.c: "We need another half-year to prepare an invasion."
trmnra.101.e: "We need another year to prepare an invasion."

trmnra.102.t: "The Reds in Vladivostok"
trmnra.102.d: "The Vladivostok Regime has fallen only to be replaced by the Bolsheviks, returned from exile. It seems that the Second Russian Civil War is now inevitable. We must reclaim our Far-Eastern lands and finally destroy the Reds!"
trmnra.102.a: "To arms!"
trmnra.102.b: "We need another month to prepare an invasion."
trmnra.102.c: "We need another half-year to prepare an invasion."
trmnra.102.e: "We need another year to prepare an invasion."

trmnra.103.t: "The NRA and the Russian Civil War"
trmnra.103.d: "Once again, Russia has fallen into a bloody civil war, with socialists against reactionaries marching towards each other. While the industrial cities were seized by workers, still there are supporters of the old regime. The command naturally views the Petrograd government as our allies in liberating all of Russia, however, there are also views that [RUS.GetLeader] is not a true representative of the people's will, but an opportunist. We must decide, whether we should join arms with them against [RVA.GetLeader] and [RRF.GetLeader], or claim the leadership of workers and peasants for us only."
trmnra.103.a: "We must help our allies in Petrograd!"
trmnra.103.b: "Down with traitors! [ROOT.GetLeader] is the legitimate ruler of all Russia!"

trmnra.104.t: "The NRA Joins Us!"
trmnra.104.d: "The People's Revolutionary Army in the Far-East has pledged their loyalty to our regime and agreed to join arms with us against the counter-revolutionaries."
trmnra.104.a: "Soon, all of Russia will be liberated..."

trmnra.105.t: "Stab in Back!"
trmnra.105.d: "The People's Revolutionary Army in the Far-East has betrayed the ideals of the Revolution and has declared our government illegitimate. These traitors have now crossed the border in a war against the workers and peasants."

trmnra.106.t: "Bolshevist Revolt in Petrograd!"
trmnra.106.d: "The recent losses of our allies in Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod have clearly shown that they are not capable of ruling the country and win the war. The Russian Communist Party, which was in opposition to them, have seized power in Petrograd, arresting the government. Now, with Grigoriy Zinoviev leading the nation, perhaps, it is time for us to re-think our cooperation and declare their government illegitimate, also giving refugee to the Left SRs."
trmnra.106.d2: "The recent losses of our enemies in Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod have clearly shown that they are not capable of ruling the country and win the war. The Russian Communist Party, which was in opposition to them, have seized power in Petrograd, arresting the government. Now, with Grigoriy Zinoviev leading the nation, perhaps, it is time for us to re-think our allegiance and recognize their government, signing a peace treaty and joining their forces."
trmnra.106.a: "The Bolsheviks are to blame. We are the true revolutionary government!"
trmnra.106.b: "The Left SRs were to blame. Join the Bolsheviks!"
trmnra.106.c: "We should not reconsider our alliances in these dire times."

trmnra.107.t: "Anarchist Revolt in Petrograd!"
trmnra.107.d: "The Communists have not lasted long... the anarchists, associated with the Left SRs, and all those who were outraged by the Bolshevist coup have prevailed. Now, as anarchy sweeps across Russia, perhaps, it is time for us to re-think our cooperation and declare their government illegitimate."
trmnra.107.a: "Russia needs stability, not anarchy. We are the true revolutionary government!"

tramsem.1.t: "The Fronde of Ataman Semyonov"
tramsem.1.d: "Ataman Semenov, the leader of the Transbaikal and Far-Eastern Cossacks, did not recognize the Kolchak government during the Civil War. Even after the end of the civil war, the region under his control remained a turbulent place, where Ataman's 'Fronde' persisted. He was one of the conspirers behind the so-called 'Kolchak Coup' in 1925, but this is due to his help, that the entire Transbaikalia region joined our jurisdiction. In the conditions of an actual civil war in the region because of the NRA partisans activity, we can take a risk and give Semyonov even more independence in the affairs of this region, temporarily, until he deals with the local unrest. We can be sure that Semyonov will cope with the suppression of the troubles in Chita. However, there are rumors that Semyonov is coordinated by Japan, and Kolchak is concerned that Semyonov may rebel with the help of the Japanese. Something has to be done."
tramsem.1.a: "That's the best we can do now."
tramsem.1.c: "Do nothing."

tramsem.3.t: "The Far-Eastern Cossack Host"
tramsem.3.d: "Today, an emergency decree of the supreme ruler on the establishment of the Transbaikal Military District under the jurisdiction of the Transbaikal Cossack Army of Ataman Semenov entered into legal force. The district includes the territories of Verkhneudinsk and Chita and adjacent territories, in which a state of emergency and martial law is being introduced to combat the partisanship of the NRA."
tramsem.3.a: "Hope he will deal with it soon."
tramsem.3.b: "Time to deal with turmoil! (Play as Transbaikalia)"

tramsem.4.t: "Turmoil in Transbaikalia"
tramsem.4.d: "The Transbaikal region is a springboard for constant resistance to the Kolchak regime. On the one hand, the region is home to the Buryat-Mongolian minority - the Buddhist people living here. During the civil war, the Buryat-Mongolian state existed for some time as an independent state. With the annexation of Transbaikalia to Transamur, the activities of the local Buryat-Mongolian self-government were suspended, but power in the region was still concentrated in the hands of civilian Siberian regionalists.\n\nIn addition to the Buryat Mongols and local regionalists, the lands of the Transbaikal Cossack army of Semenov are located in Transbaikalia and the NRA partisans are most concentrated. In fact, the region is in a state of civil war, and we need to decide what to do."
tramsem.4.a: "We should deal with the situation."

tramsem.5.t: "Support Oblastniki"
tramsem.5.d: "Ataman Semyonov has close relations with Buryat people. We can gain the support of the Oblastniki if we promise to give them autonomy. And Ataman Semyonov always keeps his promises."

tramsem.6.t: "An Offer From [TRM.GetNameDef]"

tramsem.62.a: "Too bad!"

tramsem.7.t: "The Buryat-Mongolian State"
tramsem.7.d: "The lands west of Chita are populated by the brave Buryat-Mongols. With the support of Oblastniki and Ataman Semyonov personally, these lands rightfully belong to the people who live there. The Buryat state will now exist with the help of Ataman Semyonov and under military and economic dependency on Russia. Ataman Semyonov decided to give all the power in the new state to Tsogto Badmazhapov, a national-democrat sympathetic to the Cossack cause."
tramsem.7.a: "Buryat-Mongols shall be free."

tramsem.9.t: "The Eastern Okraina"
tramsem.9.d: "The Eastern Okraine, or the Russian Eastern Outskirts is a state, where the whole civil and military power on the territory of Russian eastern outskirts is in Ataman Semyonov's hands. Our country stays stronger than ever."
tramsem.9.a: "Long Live Ataman Semyonov"

tramsem.8.t: "The Transbaikal Union"
tramsem.8.d: "The Far-Eastern Republic is a home to various cossack hosts - Ussuri, Amur and Semyonov's one - Transbaikal. We united all the host - but we should proclaim that we are the land of cossacks and we should promote our identity and make everyone respect it."

tramjap.3.d: "The provisional occupational authority of Yui Mitsue has come to an end, as reported from Tokyo. However, this is not the end of the colonial administration, as various Japanese officials suggest to change government in Vladivostok to appease the local population. Among the candidates our long-term Cossack ally Grigoriy Semyonov, as well as Vladivostok business circle, headed by the Merkulovs."
tramjap.3.a: "Our loyal puppet, Ataman Semyonov, should take charge."

tramnews.1.d: "Admiral Kolchak, the leader of the Far-Eastern Republic of Transamur since 1925, when he attempted to coup the government of President Kerensky, has been arrested and executed today in Vladivostok by disloyal generals. Dissatisfied with Kolchak's firm hand policies and Japanese Dependence, the new government will hopefully try to appease the needs of the citizens."

tramnews.2.t: "Attempted Assassination of Admiral Kolchak in Transamur"
tramnews.2.d: "The assassination of the permanent leader of Transamur, Admiral Kolchak, has been attempted today in Vladivostok by disloyal generals. Dissatisfied with Kolchak's firm hand policies and Japanese Dependence, the officers, led by Mikhail Diterikhs, had been crushed by the Kolchak's guards.

However, this does not apply to a partially-recognized state of Transamur in the Far-East. State news agencies now report that a successor to Nikolay II has been crowned Tsar of all the Russians.\n\nWhile it is not known what the international priorities of this reborn Russian Empire are, or even if the coronation of the Tsar will calm the turbulent nation, numerous monarchs across the world have already congratulated the Romanovs on regaining their divine birth right."

tramnews.4.t: "[TRM.GetLeader] Assumes the Leadership of the United Russia"
tramnews.4.d: "About a year or two ago nobody would believe that a partially-recognized state, heavily dependent on Japan and barely supported by Russians, would unite the country under its banner. The leader of the Far-Eastern Republic of Transamur, after the challenging Siberian War has capitulated the previous Russian government and declared Transamurian sovereignity all across the country. How will the world respond to a new Russia, what shall it expect from the new government is still unknown, however, they fear that the Russian Bear will be more determined than ever."

tramnews.8.d: "Despite nearly impossible odds, the Governor of Yakutia, Innokentiy Smolin, has restored order in the Far-Eastern Republic of Transamur. Marching from the frozen wastes of Yakutia, few expected Smolin to succeed in his goal to restore order in the Far East. A former confidant of the late Admiral-Dictator, the new Supreme Ruler vows to continue Kolchak’s mission towards uniting Russia."

trammlad.147.t: "The Union of Mladorossi"
trammlad.147.d: "The history of the "Young Russian" movement is inexorably tied to its leader, the charismatic aristocrat Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek, born in 1902 to a wealthy noble family of Azeri and Iranian origin. The three ideological phases of the Mladorossi can be closely mapped to Kazem-Bek's own life and experience; unsurprisingly considering his role as orator and ideologist. As a student activist, Kazem-Bek helped form the "Union of Young Russia" in 1923. Uniting 29 organisations and 4,000 people, the Young Russians represented the monarchist youth wing. Prone to intellectualism and ideologically vague, its members jointly rejected reactionary Tsarism in favour of a "new and dynamic vision". As secretary, Kazem-Bek met with Professor Nikolai Ustryalov, once head of the press bureau under Admiral Kolchak. Ustryalov convinced the young aristocrat to throw his support behind the putsch against President Kerensky in 1924. Both fled to Transamur following the coup's failure, taking their respective supporters along with them. Ustryalov became disillusioned with the White movement, and began idolising the Bolsheviks as defenders of Russian sovereignty.\n\nThe formation of the "Union of Young Russians" in 1925 marked the second ideological phase of the Mladorossi. Kazem-Bek began formulating his thesis of the "Labor Monarchy" under Ustryalov's tutelage. The nascent ideology of the Mladorossi combined an absolute monarchy, Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". During this period of 1925-1933, most Mladorossi were united only by theatrical oath-swearing ceremonies and readership of journals such as "Vivacity!" and "Towards Young Russia". The third phase occurred shortly after Kazem-Bek's travels to the Syndicalist nations of Europe. Kazem-Bek was particularly inspired by the proto-Totalism of the French & Italian national syndicalists, as well as the British Mosleyites. On his return, Kazem-Bek formed the "Mladoross Party" in 1934 as its "Vozhd". His ideas on how to organise the Young Russian State have coalesced into a single-party corporatist model under a Worker-Monarch.\n\nWith a strict party structure and growing paramilitary wing, Kazem-Bek hopes to achieve control of Transamur, and then his beloved homeland, Russia."

trammlad.148.t: "The All-Russian Nationalist Movement"
trammlad.148.d: "The All-Russian National-Revolutionary Labour Worker-Peasant Party of Nationalists, or as they're commonly referred to, All-Russian Nationalist Movement or the Natsionalisty, are an ultranationalist political organization who in recent years have become increasingly popular among the citizens on Transamur. Formed in 1931 by local politician and Kolchak loyalist, Anastasiy Vonsyatsky, the Natsionalisty have found support amongst Manchurian Russians and monarchist exiles. Young emigres still loyal to the ideals of a Russian Tsardom have flocked to this movement in awe of Vonsyatsky’s fiery speeches denouncing Bolshevism, Kerensky and Western Capitalism. All of which he accuses of degenerating the Russian people whilst declaring loyalty to Admiral Kolchak, the Russian Orthodox Church and a restored Tsardom. Espousing the homegrown ideology of “True Russian Nationalism”, the Natsionalisty have organised its members into a paramilitary force known as the, Black Vanguard, undoubtedly a reference to the Black Hundred.\n\n The Black Vanguard have provided security to Kolchak’s regime and have engaged in rounding up political dissidents as well as prominent members of the Jewish Vladivostok community accused of promoting ''dangerous foreign ideologies''. Admiral Kolchak has allowed for these actions to take place without officially endorsing the movements, perhaps to appease the Japanese authorities wary of an anti-foreign movement."

trammlad.149.t: "Alexander Kazem-Bek Crowns Himself Interim Tsar!"
trammlad.149.d: "Due to a lack of interest by the mainstream Tsarist claimants, Alexander Kazem-Bek has been forced to improvise, and declare himself Interim Regent until a proper Tsar can be crowned. This move has proved to many that the Mladorossi is nothing but a joke and has greatly damaged our legitimacy in the eyes of the Russian people. But, Kazem-Bek still holds out hope that a Romanov Claimant will approach us and let us crown him Tsar. However, one positive is that Kazem-Bek’s position has never been stronger, as there is no Tsar that reigns technically above him; even though the Tsar would hold little real power. However, for now the People’s Tsardom of Transamur will have to remain a Tsardom in name only."

The Regency council has finished its work, and was ready to announce the new Tsar of All Russia. As Kazem-bek has announced the name of the pretender, there was celebrating and partying, a triumph of hedonism. It ended quietly soon after with the formal coronation of the Tsar himself and a speech from Kazem-Bek about bringing Russia into a modernity and bringing it to its Greatest time since the time of Catherine the Great."

They committed GREAT atrocities against the peoples of Russian inorder to defeat the Bolsheviks 'devils; ultimately it took the Great Satan himself, the Kaiser of Germany, to save them from the heroes of the October Revolution. Their Devil-Tsar Nicholas II was by far the worst Tsar he ever had allowing his wife to be seduced by the devil Rasputin and doing nothing of it! He himself was a weak sheep allowing anyone and anything to tell him what to do. The Kulak Industrialists told him to not let Brusilov destroy the German Aggressors!

An army that will stand shoulder to shoulder, prepared to die for their leader and nation. An army that would follow the Vozhd to the Gates of Hell without ever questioning an order. That is an army of which Kazem-Bek has forged, the Blueshirts, named due to their dark blue shirts along with red armbands and white trousers. These titans of men represent the strength required to restore the Russian Tsardom, but these men are no elitist sycophants that have previously stood behind a Tsar. The Blueshirts are composed of rugged working-class proletariat workers who have evolved out of the brawls in the streets of Vladivostok and into disciplined soldiers waving the banner of Russia and the Mladorossi. Inspired by both Ivan the Terrible’s devoutly loyal Oprichniki and the ultrnationalist militias of the Black Hundreds, they may lack expert training and state of the art equipment however they make up for it with their faith in mother Russia!"

Alexander Kazem-Bek held within him a fiery passion that struck a light in the minds and souls of working patriots across the Russian lands. He rejected the spiralling crash brought upon by bickering factions of lifeless hordes eager to tear eachother apart in the name of power and greed! Kazem-Bek rallied those fellow brave nationalists and together they defeated the enemy within! Russia has ascended beyond its stagnant state, no longer the sickman of the globe. The heart of Russia is the heart of the Mladorossi, the movement has become Russia’s new identity.

To the great surprise of many, the red banner of the Mladorossi was lowered, and the Nationalist party flag was raised to replace it.\nIn addition to reshuffling the government, many Mladorossi were soon dismissed from their posts and replaced with Nationalist candidates. But that was just the beginning. The beginning of the end of the Mladorossi.\n\nVery soon, mass purges began. Not limiting themselves to dismissals, the Nationalists began to arrest Mladorossi, and the leaders of local units, according to rumors, were executed without trial. Soon the Mladorossi were officially declared "Enemies of the Crown", their flags were seized and burned in the central square of Vladivostok.\n\nNationalist flags with huge Turtles were hung on almost every building, and Vonsyatsky was portrayed in the media as a great leader, the only one who could save Russia from Bolshevism and Kerenshchina."

The fourth way is the way of the Russian People. United by the Tsar and the Vozhd, the power of the working masses fighting for a nation humiliated by the Japanese and Germans, betrayed by the allies.\n\nLong live our great union, for its path will light up the whole of Russia.

The Nationalist Party proposed the cooperation of the DORS in the struggle against the Petrograd regime, setting one of its main goals as the restoration of the monarchy and the return of the Tsar to the throne, which should have pleased some of those present.\n\nBy the evening, the meeting was over, but there was no response from the DO-ROVS yet, but they promised to give an answer soon."

trammlad.522.d: "The Vozhd Vonsyatsky personally sent a letter to General Denikin and urged him to join the troops of the true Russian army.

trammlad.523.t: "No Response From Petrograd"
trammlad.523.d: "A month has passed, but the Vozhd has not received a response from General Denikin, and this can only mean that either the letter did not reach, which is unlikely, or that it did not come, which is also unlikely. However, according to the Vozhd, the most likely thing is that Denikin is a coward, a scoundrel and a scumbag who hates the Russian nation and is ready to serve the German bastards.\n\nThere will be no place for such people in the new Russia."

The Vozhd of Vonsyatsky talked for a long time with one of the candidates for tsar, and it seems that they found a common language. In general, all of the candidates present expressed their support for the Nationalists and were ready, in the words of the Leader, to sacrifice themselves for the victory of the Russian people, whatever that means. In any case, the so-called "Regency Council", consisting mainly of Vonsyatsky's closest associates and himself, should decide on the coronation of the new tsar."

trammlad.533.t: "Of Turtles and Men"
trammlad.533.d: "Sitting in his meticulously organized study as a Rachmaninoff symphony played in the background, Vozhd Vonsiatsky weaved his deft and delicate hands in a blur as he painted something at his desk. A well-known lover of all things Testudine, Vonsiatsky was not painting on a canvas of fiber or paper, but of shell! Keeping a large personal menagerie of various tortoise and turtle species in his home all scattered about in different ponds, gardens, and tanks around the estate, Vonsiatsky adores the small creatures, and has picked up a rather odd hobby relating to them. \n\nThough it is sometimes normal for people to paint the shells of their pet turtles, our Vozhd has taken it further, painting the globus cruciger symbol of the Mladorossi movement on their shells and parading them around as party mascots. Our Vozhd has taken this so far that he even wears a small turtle pin on his lapel and brings a few of these painted propaganda turtles along with him wherever he goes to spread the message and notoriety of our new creed. Whatever his reasoning is for loving these odd and slow creatures - which he calls his own ‘tank corp’ - is unknown, but they have become a symbol of our new movement all the same."

trammlad.527.d: "Along with the power of the nationalists came severe discipline. The streets of Far Eastern cities are now quiet and clean, without tramps and drunks. The buildings are decorated with white-blue-red banners with a Turtle, and the Black Vanguard, which has received permission to carry out law enforcement activities from the Vozhd himself, walks along the streets.\n\nThis is a country of light, where the Pacific sun shines on the bright faces of people, Russian people, where only occasionally you can see the faces of the Japanese who have not yet had time to leave, cowardly scurrying through the alleys. The Russian nation has risen. But it's damp and cold in the shadow of the Turtle. In the shadow of the Turtle, people are taken from their homes, beaten and arrested for criticizing the party and the Vozhd. But this is our new reality. And she can not but please a simple Russian peasant."

trammlad.528.t: "Eradicating Japanese Influence" 
trammlad.528.d: "The distrust of the Japanese community within our nation has always been known, and the Natsionalisty has been furthering this by branding the Japanese as traitors in hiding, agents of a foreign government and those who are keeping the Russians down with their control of the banks. These rallies and speeches acted as a gas canister being poured onto wooden logs before a fire, with uniformed members of the Natsionalisty organizing marches through Japanese settlements and drawing the rising sun on Japanese owned businesses, identifying to the entire city who it was owned by. \n\nThis was the beginning of course, with the gasoline only needing a spark to be lit, and today that spark has been provided. The distant horizon held a shadow play of flames and smoke coming from the burning Japanese homes, where their businesses were set aflame by Natsionalisty crowds and people out in the street at the time were beaten savagely. The night proved to be long and terrifying to those sheltering down in their homes, hoping fire would not be lit to them. At long last however, the crowds dispersed and the military appeared, initially thought to be restoring order, but they ended up proving to be a bitter end to the Japanese community that greeted them when they ordered them to mount trucks. They were being relocated for their own ‘safety’, safety that would just so happen to be conveniently located across the border outside Russia."

He himself fought against the red menace years ago, and even after that work was done decided to continue his efforts against the poison that is bolshevism by organizing the Natsionalisty here in Vladivostok. Preaching the truth of what is necessary to return Russia to greatness and defeat the Germans, Japanese and the Red menace that lurks in the shadows. Now the Tsar himself sits restored, a feat we only have to thank Anastasy for! \n\nSo for this, the nation must be thankful. Within the streets of our capitol sit great portraits of Vonsyatsky, Our nation’s families thanking him for their bread while our troops shall have thoughts of what he has done for our nation while they fight for it. There shall not be a moment where our people are not reminded of what he has done for them and his greatness, as school children shall sing songs of his deeds while aspiring to be able to prove their loyalty to a man they have everything to be grateful for, because who else would give the children of our nation an education, if not for the Vozhd?

When Kolchak became a leader of Transamur, he promised wide autonomy to Siberia as soon as it will be controlled by Kolchak's White Guard. The moment has come.

TRM_Amur_TITLE: "§LThe Region of Amur connects the Transbaikal region with the rest of the Far-Eastern territory by making it a strategically important region for Kolchak Government. Kolchak ensured the control of the Transsiberian Railroad in Amur Region with the help of the DO-ROVS, which made town of Zeya a military base. Even though the governmental forces are controling the majority of Amur region, the NRA partisans are also active here, trying to regain control over Amur for years without any success.§!"
TRM_Bodaybo_TITLE: "§LLocated in the Patom Highlands, Bodaybo was once known to be a perspective gold-mining region in Eastern Siberia, but in 1915 the area was cut off from the supply centers and as a result, gold production by 1921 decreased tenfold.\nWhile Kolchak's government tried to boost the gold industry in the region, it is still highly inefficient and the local civilian government takes about 80% of the gold to improve the area, providing the central authorities with almost no profit.§!"
TRM_Blagoveschensk_TITLE: "§LCity of Blagoveshchensk, having the same name as the region, is a gradually developing and industrializing city, a large and important river port. It is known to once become the capital of the Amur Labour Socialist Republic during the Civil War and the socialist sentiments are still strong here. Moreover, the region is a home to the Amur Cossack Host.\nThe city, same to Zeya, is under the control of the DO-ROVS detachments aimed to bring peace and order in the region.§!"
TRM_Buryatia_TITLE: "§LRegion of Verkhneudinsk, named after the largest city in the area, was a great battlefield during the civil war: events, that significantly determined the current affairs in the region. Verkhneudinsk, bordering Irkutsk region of Russia is in a state of constant war preparations and increased border security, maintained by the joint forces of Kolchak and Cossacks. At the same time, the region has a local civilian government of Oblastniki and Buryats, who view Verkhneudinsk as their native and rightful home.\nMoreover, the region is filled with NRA partisans who try to provoke and sabotage either of the present political groups.§!"
TRM_Chita_TITLE: "§LChita is a large transport hub, which brings together a lot of Far-Eastern workers and, therefore, NRA partisans. What is more, local Chita Oblastniki are also a powerful force in the region, who are engaged in the power struggle with the local Master of Chita...\nThe region is under an undisputed control of Ataman Semyonov, who constantly terrorizes NRA and Oblastniki and builds a strong Cossack Host. Even though Kolchak needs Semyonov's support, he does not know about his real intentions and Japanese ties.§!"
TRM_Kamchatka_TITLE: "§LBeing the easternmost part of the Eurasian continent, Kamchatka is the 'godforsaken place'. Despite being such a notorious place, it still has some benefits, regarding fishery. Moreover, the Vladivostok Business circles and the Japanese are investing much resources into city of Petropavlovsk, trying to build a new seaport and a shipyard.§!"
TRM_Kurily_TITLE: "§LThe Kuril Islands which were a part of the Japanese Empire since 1875, despite being an absolutely useless region at first glance, is strategically important for the Pacific Fleet. The Vries Strait between the islands is the only ice-free strait, which allows the Pacific Fleet to leave the Okhotsk Sea for the Pacific Ocean.§!"
TRM_Khabarovsk_TITLE: "§LThe Region of Khabarovsk was one of the main battlefields during the Civil War. Right now the Ussuri Cossack Host is located here, though its power is very limited due to the fact, that Khabarovsk is located in the so-called 'core Transamur'. The private sector and industry in the city is monopolized by Vladivostok Business Circles, which helps the NRA to bolster socialist sentiments in the region. Even though Khabarovsk is under military control of Kolchak's government, it also has the presence of the Japanese and Fengtian garrisons that ensure regular trading on concessional terms with Vladivostok Business Circle.§!"
TRM_Magadan_TITLE: "§LThe City of Okhotsk was once the main base the main base on the eastern borders of Russia for the flotilla and ships of the Russian-American Company and later became the cradle of the Pacific Fleet. However, the glorious times have passed and now Okhotsk is nothing more than another 'godforsaken place' in the middle of Siberian nowhere. Despite Okhotsk desolation, the Pacific Fleet is still there and is still loyal to the Supreme Ruler and Admiral, making it a cherry on the cake for the Japanese Empire.§!"
TRM_Nikolayevsk_TITLE: "§LDespite the fact that Nikolaevsk is a fairly small city located at the mouth of the Amur River, it is the center of gold mining in the entire Russian Far East and the second most important Far Eastern port.\nThough initially under the Japanese Intervention protection, right now the city of Nikolayevsk and the entire region is the main strongold of the DO-ROVS. Under firm hand of General Diterikhs, the region is becoming a new center of Russian Orthodoxy with radical Holy-Cross divisions being formed from citizens who are willing to fight in the Great Crusade Against... anything Diterikhs deems enough unspiritual§!"
TRM_Vladivostok_TITLE: "§LAh, Vladivostok, the Pacific gate of Russia!\nThe capital city of the Far East is perhaps the only place in the country where its fate is decided. With the Port of Vladivostok under occupation of the Japanese forces and Vladivostok Business Circle, the administrative buildings under 'occupation' of Kolchak Government, the military bases under control of the DO-ROVS, only streets and factories are left, where people are talking only about freedom and equality, inspired by the local Oblastniki and underground NRA resistance.§!"
TRM_Primorye_TITLE: "§LPrimorye, despite being close to the capital city is much less developed, with the Kolchak loyalist forces spread across the region, trying to restore order. The influence of the Japanese and Vladivostok Business is as high here, as in the city of Vladivostok.§!"
TRM_Sakhalin_TITLE: "§LThe island of Sakhalin was under full Japanese occupation since 1920, making 'Karafuto' one of the bastions of the Japanese forces. The Sakhalin region is not only rich in fish, forest and coal, but also in something, very precious - Oil. As long as Sakhalin is ours, we can be sure that we have cheap fuel for the Pacific Fleet§!"
TRM_Yakutia_TITLE: "§LYakutia, the land of native Yakuts has a long and complex story of relations with Kolchak government. When in November 1918 Yakutia was captured by Kolchak's troops, the local Yakuts never received the autonomy they wanted and anti-Kolchak rebellion succeeded in December 1919. However, the Civil War soon came to an end, bringing back the civilian republican government, which still did nothing with desired Yakut Autonomy. Everything changed in 1925 when Oblastniki seized the initiative and joined the Far-Eastern Republic, establishing Yakut Autonomous Republic. Though Yakutia still stays anti-Kolchak, they will not tolerate his suzerainty over their territory.§!"

In the framework of Diterikhs's policy of restoring the traditional way of life for Russia, the Zemskaya Rat army corps was organized into groups divided into regiments, formed from former brigades.

### 1936 Crisis ###

tram_crisis_1936.1.d: "Today in Barguzin, Transbaikalia, our border guards noticed that a plane, apparently belonging to the Russian Air Force, had violated the borders. The latest Japanese Far East fighters were airborne towards it, but the plane could not be tracked - having performed a first-class maneuver, it seemed to disappear in the clouds over Baikal.\n\nImmediately, a note of protest was sent to Petrograd demanding an end to the illegal overflights of the Far East."
tram_crisis_1936.1.a: "We should strengthen our anti-air defence in the region."

tram_crisis_1936.2.t: "Barguzin Incident"
tram_crisis_1936.2.d: "Today in Barguzin, Transbaikalia, the Transamurian border guards are said to have noticed that a plane, apparently belonging to the Russian Air Force, had violated the 'borders'. The newest Japanese Far East fighters were airborne towards it, but the plane could not be tracked - having performed a first-class maneuver, it seemed to disappear in the clouds over Baikal.\n\nImmediately, a note of protest was sent to us demanding an end to the illegal overflights of the Far East."
tram_crisis_1936.2.a: "Their accusations are unfounded"

tram_crisis_1936.3.t: "Vitim Incident"
tram_crisis_1936.3.d: "Rumors flew around many Transbaikal newspapers about a ghostly Vitim boat - in a fishing town near the border of the unrecognized [RUS.GetName]. According to local residents, they saw an armored boat of Russian river troops dangerously close to the town at night. The fishermen, frightened by the landing and the outbreak of war, locked themselves in their homes, but just a few minutes later the armored boat disappeared. \n\nThe mysterious incident took place a couple of days ago when the weather was foggy, but some generals from the General Staff believe the story is not fictional and we should be wary of other Russian armored boats."
tram_crisis_1936.3.a: "The local drunks are making up stories again"

tram_crisis_1936.4.t: "Nizhneangarsk Sniper"
tram_crisis_1936.4.d: "Today, during a standard border patrol and surveillance of the area near the most northerly shore of Lake Baikal and the mouth of a river Kichera, one of our border guardsmen was fatally injured by a well-directed sniper shot from the [RUS.GetAdjective] side.\n\nLately, there has been an increase in the frequency of attacks on our brave border guards by the arrogant [RUS.GetName], prompting the government to issue an immediate protest note to [RUS.Capital.GetName], accompanied by a warning of a potential response."
tram_crisis_1936.4.a: "[RUS.Capital.GetName]'s actions lead to escalation"

### 1937 Crisis ###
tram_crisis_1937.1.t: "Slyudyanka Incident"
tram_crisis_1937.1.d: "An emergency telegram from the Minister of Foreign Affairs reached [ROOT.GetLeader] today, assuring that yesterday, 15 km from the \"Slyudyanka\" outpost on our territory, the border patrol noticed two [TRM.GetAdjective] soldiers who were trying to connect to the communication line. The soldier was killed and the non-commissioned officer was detained, and a rifle and a hand-machine gun were taken from the intruders. Shortly thereafter another group of [TRM.GetAdjective] soldiers were seen, who, according to the minister's assurance, were the first to open fire. Several of our border guards were killed in the exchange of fire, but the other side suffered casualties as well.\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs placed immediate responsibility for this on the so-called Transamura government and demanded that [ROOT.GetLeader] decide immediately on a preventive strike. It is quite possible that this is what is expected of us in [TRM.Capital.GetName]..."
tram_crisis_1937.1.a: "Demand formal apologies from [TRM.GetName]!"

tram_crisis_1937.2.t: "Slyudyanka Incident"
tram_crisis_1937.2.d: "Yesterday a terrible provocation from the Russian forces happened 15 km from the \"Slyudyanka\" outpost deep in [RUS.GetAdjective] territory. Their minister of foreign affairs has claimed that the border patrol has noticed two of our soliders, who were accused of trying to connect to the communication line. While one of them was killed and the other, a non-commissioned officer, was detained, with rifle and even a hand-machine gun. Moreover, they claimed that shortly thereafter another group of our soldiers were seen on their territory, who, according to their minister's assurance, have opened fire! The armed clashes have soon begun with wounded and killed on both sides. The [RUS.GetLeader] has demanded formal apologies from us for the incident, and it seems like [RUS.GetName] is currently mobilising to make a preventive strike!"
tram_crisis_1937.2.a: "Seems like a provocation!"

tram_crisis_1937.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Formal Apologies"
tram_crisis_1937.3.d: "As stated before, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has demanded formal apologies for the 'Slyudyanka Incident'. However, with clear signs of provocation and no real evidence presented to us, [ROOT.GetLeader] has decided that the best tactics right now is to stay silent and not to apologize for actions, they have made up themselves."
tram_crisis_1937.3.a: "Refuse to react on this provocation."

tram_crisis_1937.4.t: "Silence on That End"
tram_crisis_1937.4.d: "Clearly, [TRM.GetAdjective] illegitimate government has refused to react anyhow, neither apologising nor answering our requests. With their violations of our territory each day, it is now becoming clear that a serious confrontation is soon to begin. Having listened to the advice of our Head of Army, [ROOT.GetLeader] has decided to send a division to Transbaikalia, remiding [TRM.GetName] of who should control these territories."
tram_crisis_1937.4.a: "Send one division into Transbaikalia"

tram_crisis_1937.5.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Soldiers Cross Border in Transbaikalia"
tram_crisis_1937.5.d: "Our border guards have just sent an emergency telegram to [ROOT.Capital.GetName] about a large detachment of [RUS.GetAdjective] soliders crossing the borders in Slyudyanka and trying to advance deep in Transbaikalia. While there was no formal declaration of war, we have to defend our territory without violation of what [RUS.GetAdjective] government believes to be 'their territory'. The other choice, presented to [ROOT.GetLeader] is outright declare war on those bastards!"
tram_crisis_1937.5.a: "We must defend!"
tram_crisis_1937.5.b: "The time has come - all of Russia should be ours!"

tram_crisis_1937.16.d: "A few weeks ago, there was an escalation of tensions between the partially recognised [TRM.GetName] and [RUS.GetNameDef], resulting in a border conflict. According to reports from the Russian government, the [TRM.GetAdjective] forces, equipped with rifles and light machine guns, initiated the hostilities by opening fire on [RUS.GetAdjective] border patrols, causing casualties on both sides. This sparked a series of real border skirmishes, further exacerbating the situation and leading to additional casualties.\n\nThe conflict is not yet over, and it is becoming increasingly clear that the growing tensions between these two entities, which contest each other's very existence, could potentially escalate into a full-scale war."
tram_crisis_1937.16.a: "Serious instability in the Far-East"

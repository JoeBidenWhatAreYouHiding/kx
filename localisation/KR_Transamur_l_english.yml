tram.intro.t: "Transamur - Provisional Russian State in Vladivostok"
tram.intro.d: "Siberia and the Russian Far East had been a major area of conflict during the Russian Civil War, as the location of a short-lived democratic republic, the rising of the 'Czech Legion' and Japanese intervention. While forced to evacuate their forces due to German pressure (as well as intense resistance from local Cossacks), the Japanese remained eager to extend their influence and in 1922 pushed for the establishment of an independent state in the Transamur region. This motion gained the support of the Vladivostok business community, despite the fact that it left them vulnerable to forming an economic dependency on Japan. The majority of the business community however saw economic and diplomatic relations with the rising power in the East as a significant advantage, especially when compared to the alternative of being sucked further into the disorder besetting the rest of Russia. The new nation gained a prominent figurehead in the form of Admiral Kolchak, one of the most successful White Generals of the civil war and the one-time self-proclaimed 'Supreme Ruler of All Russia', who had been forced to flee Russia following his unsuccessful attempt to seize control in 1925.\n\nIn 1936, the Transamur Republic has become a corporate and militaristic state, highly tied economically to Japanese Empire. And yet Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"
tram.intro.a: "Interesting..."
tram.intro.b: "Tell me more about Transamur Politics"

tram.999.t: "The Oblastniki - Siberian Regionalists"
tram.999.d: "Siberian Regionalism is a political movement to form an autonomous Siberia. Firstly developed in the 19th century by Siberian students, it gained huge popularity during the Russian Civil War with the creation of the Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia. However, the Provisional Siberian Government sacrificed own independence for the sake of consolidation of all possible forces to fight with Bolsheviks.\n\nDuring the rule of Kerensky, though Russia was stated as a federative republic, President has continuosly blocked all resolutions about giving wider autonomy to Siberia and it is still an undeveloped region.\n\nWhile the majority of the Siberia is under control of the Petrograd Regime, most of the Oblastniks, both leftist and rightist have support their former ally - Admiral Kolchak in the putsch as he promised wide autonomy to Siberia and he even invited a prominent Oblastnik - Pyotr Vologodsky to become a prime-minister.\n\nIn 1936 they are still waiting for Kolchak to finally unite Russia under his rule and proclaim Siberian Autonomy. Their resistance increases with their popularity and if it is high enough they can even attempt to overthrow Kolchak."

tram.998.t: "The Japanese Business Interests in Transamur"
tram.998.d: "The Japanese Empire has a huge influence on our country - they were the ones that intervened in the Far-East during the Russian Civil War and expanded their influence in the Transamur Region. In 1922 an independent nation was formed in Vladivostok, supported by local business community. However, everything changed, when in 1925 Kolchak tried to coup the Russian government and was forced to flee to Transamur, supported by Oblastniki and Transbaikal Cossacks.\n\nFinding himself in a partially-recognized state with only ally, Kolchak has nothing to do but establish even stronger economic ties with the Japanese Empire. While formally Transamur is independent, Japanese has a free military access to our territory and provide us with supplies. Our dependence on Japan varies proportionally with the popularity of the Japanese Delegation. If their influence becomes too high, they will try to establish full control over our country."

tram.997.t: "Vladivostok Business Community"
tram.997.d: "The business circles of Vladivostok-namely, the Merkulov Brothers, and other, smaller businessmen, were the basis of Transamur when this state was first proclaimed. Although in 1925 they did not become part of the Kolchak Council of Ministers, in fact, all foreign trade is based on them. Under their control, together with the Kwantung Army, is the port of Vladivostok. This situation allows the Merkulovs to get rich, the Japanese garrison to receive corrupt bribes, and Kolchak can only silently watch the rampant crime. With each visit of the Japanese delegation, the business community is becoming more and more focused on trade with Japan. And it seems that this state of affairs will remain unchanged until Kolchak decides to finally break all ties with the Japanese Empire."

tram.996.t: "DO-ROVS - Siberian Monarchists"
tram.996.d: "General Diterikhs is a convinced monarchist, whose ideas are sometimes even too radical. Disappointed in the decision of the constituent assembly to establish a Republic and not return the tsar to the throne, Diterikhs soon joined Kolchak's putsch in 1925 and ended up in Transamur with him.\n\nHere he founded the so-called 'Far Eastern Branch of the Russian All-Military Union' and settled in Nikolayevsk, where a camp of his 'Crusaders' has been created. In addition, Diterikhs also established military control over the Trans-Siberian Railway near the Rukhlovo station, where the railway connects Primorye with Transbaikalia and Yakutia.\n\nDiterikhs is still more or less loyal to the Admiral, as he hopes that the Supreme Ruler will restore the Monarchy as soon as he takes Moscow. Nobody knows why Diterikhs is so sure of this, but Kolchak should be careful, because if the DO-ROVS is not loyal to the Supreme Ruler, anything can be expected from them."

tram.995.t: "Ataman Semyenov and the Cossacks"
tram.995.d: "Ataman Semyenov is an extraordinary person. Fluent in Buryat and Mongolian, Semyenov has surrounded himself with loyal people and has his own interests in the Far Eastern region. The ataman of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks, the marching ataman of the Amur and Ussuri Cossacks, Semyenov is the main representative of the interests of the Cossacks in Transamur. Despite the fact that he supported Admiral Kolchak both during the civil war and during the coup, his real intentions are unknown. According to rumors, his Cossack troops are supplied with Japanese weapons.\n\nAt the moment, Semyenov is actually waging a war with the remnants of Bolshevism - the partisans of the NRA, and despite the fact that he supports the oblasts and Buryat autonomists, he is engaged in power struggle with them for power in Transbaikalia. It is not known how loyal the Cossacks are to Kolchak, but the Supreme Ruler knows one thing for sure - you can expect anything from them."

tram.994.t: "NRA - The Last Stronghold of Bolshevism"
tram.994.d: "The Far Eastern People's Revolutionary Army is all that remains of the Red Army in the Far East, if these partisans can be called an army at all. General Blucher, their leader, is undoubtedly a coward. Having been defeated by the Siberian Army, he deserted and hid in the Siberian taiga. Surprisingly, somehow, the partisan movement in Transbaikalia was able to survive until our days. Perhaps the slave conditions of the workers in Chita and Khabarovsk contributed to this, but now the NRA are isolated partisans scattered across Transbaikalia, agitating for a return to Bolshevism. Leading an underground struggle and arranging sabotage, this movement must be destroyed."


tram.1.t: "Transamur Breaks Away!"
tram.1.d: "The Transamur Republic has taken great offence at our attempts to regulate their internal affairs, and are severing all political ties with us!"

He fought in many wars, but he could not won the war with death. The Artillery at the Vladivostok Bay has fired a volley in his honour. His rule was short - who knows how he had wanted to see the future of Russia."

tram.3.a: "Memento Mori"

tram.4.d: "Today, the leader of the DO-ROVS, the head of government, Mikhail Diterikhs has passed away at the age of 64. We will always remember him as a hero of Russia. He fought in many wars, but he could not won the war with death. The Artillery at the Vladivostok Bay has fired a volley in his honour. During his short rule as a Transamurian leader, he made an important decision in time - restore Russian monarchy."

tram.6.t: "Panic in Siberia!"
tram.6.d: "The Russian government has proven itself unable to maintain the security of its Siberian territories. We have received word that many local leaders want to secede and join Transamur! There may be international complications but we may never get another opportunity like this!"
tram.6.a: "Claim the land up to Lake Baikal!"
tram.6.b: "Ask the Japanese Empire for permission."

tram.7.t: "Transamur's Ambitions in Siberia"

tram.12.a: "Great!"

tram.21.t: "Transamur Invades the Far-East!"
tram.21.d: "Transamur has taken advantage of the unrest in Siberia to establish its control over the region. While this is a great infringement on our sovereignty we are currently very weak and may not be able to win a war to reclaim our lands, especially since fighting Transamur may mean fighting Japan as well."
tram.21.a: "It is useless to fight over an icy wasteland."
tram.21.b: "Come and take it then - who believe in such ruse anyway?"
tram.21.c: "What!? Siberia shall always belong to Russia!"

tram.22.t: "Transamur Invades Irkutsk"
tram.22.d: "Transamur has taken advantage of the unrest in Siberia to establish its control over Irkutsk. While this is a great infringement on our sovereignty, we are currently very weak in the Far East and can not hope to win a war to reclaim our lands, especially since we are barely control the land to the east of Urals."
tram.22.a: "Damn it!"

tram.23.t: "Russia Refuses to Intervene"

tram.24.t: "Russia Responses with Force!"

tram.25.t: "Reds Purge in the Russian Far East"
tram.25.d: "The new-established socialist regime in Western Russia has shown that it is too weak to control areas distant from its urban heartland. Our troops have successfully seized the Russian Far East from them, purging what little influence they held in the region."
tram.25.a: "We shall suffer no leftists in our rightful territory."

tram.26.t: "Russia Refuses to Cede the Far-East"
tram.26.d: "It appears that although the illegitimate Russian regime recognises our efforts to seize control of Siberia they have refused to withdraw their forces and allow the region to fall into our hands. It appears that we must now make a decision on whether to continue the invasion and risk open war."
tram.26.a: "War will solve our disputes!"
tram.26.b: "We are not ready for conflict."

tram.42.t: "Transamurian Expansion in Siberia"
tram.42.d: "Our ally, the Transamur Republic, has established its control over several parts of Siberia. While this is a fine addition to the Co-Prosperity Sphere it is possible that Transamur is becoming too powerful and needs to be restrained."
tram.42.a: "Demand Kamchatka and Okhotsk!"
tram.42.b: "It is good to have strong client states!"
tram.42.c: "[TRM.GetLeader] is too greedy for his own good. Maybe we can try to replace him?"

tram.47.t: "Japan Demands Bases"
tram.47.d: "The Japanese have congratulated us on our seizure of Siberia but the Representative of the Mikado states that we should allow Japan to administer Kamchatka and allow them to establish a naval base in the Sea of Okhotsk."
tram.47.a: "Yes, we still need Japanese protection."
tram.47.b: "It is time to throw off the Japanese yoke!"

tram.48.t: "Japan Plots a Coup Against [TRM.GetLeader]!"
tram.48.d: "The Japanese believe [TRM.GetLeader] has outlived his usefulness and have approached the elite of Transamur with the plan of backing a coup d'etat to replace him with a more compliant council of business and military leaders."
tram.48.a: "Yes, [TRM.GetLeader] should be removed!"
tram.48.b: "Who they think they are?"

tram.49.t: "Transamur Submits"
tram.49.d: "[TRM.GetLeader] has decided to submit and kneel before us. Now, there is an empty office of the Vladivostok governorship, and so we shall find a replacement. There are several available options: Ataman Semyenov, leader of Transbaikal Cossack Host. A content Cossack ataman, he would be unlikely to cause serious problems. There is also the choice of the General Yui Mitsue who once was in command of Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. An old man deserving of a proper retirement, rule in Transamur would be a good fit for him. Still, several liberal ministers have been suggesting that we should establish a new democratic regime in Transamur instead."
tram.49.a: "General Mitsue, you have a new order."
tram.49.b: "This Wojciechowski knows how to rule the people."
tram.49.c: "Humble servants like Semyenov are always welcome."
tram.49.e: "A new Transamur Republic shall rise!"

tram.50.t: "A New Order in Transamur"
tram.50.d: "The Japanese have decided that [TRM.GetLeader] should now guide us. We have no choice but to submit to their will."
tram.50.a: "We are even more dependent now!"

tram.56.t: "A Rival Government"
tram.56.d: "If the government of Kerenskiy is said to be fairly elected, the new Russian Government is as legitimate as we are. The new Russian government has proven itself unable to maintain the security of its Siberian territories. We have received word that many local leaders want to secede and join Transamur! There may be international complications but we may never get another opportunity like this!"
tram.56.a: "Claim Lake Baikal!"

tram.67.t: "Transamur Attempts to Break Free"
tram.67.d: "With the recent reconquest of Siberia by Transamur they have become much bolder, trying to forge their own way under the sun. Recently they have moved their capital from Vladivostok to more remote parts of their republic, a clear attempt to minimise our influence. What shall we do?"

tram.68.t: "Japan Demands Our Submission!"
tram.68.d: "The Japanese feel threatened by our attempts to minimise their influence over our country and they have issued an ultimatum to us in which they demand the cessation of steps threatening their sphere of prosperity."

tram.79.t: "Anti-Kolchak Coup"
tram.79.d: "The Oblastniki resistance has been too high for some time, their disapproval with Kolchak has risen a lot. Now they openly revolt against us. Kolchak can submit and de-facto give the reins of power to them or suppress this movement."


tram.80.t: "Anti-Kolchak Coup"
tram.80.d: "The opposition have started an open revolt against us. Disloyal generals and soldiers, lead by Mikhail Diterikhs, have captured the most important neighbourhoods and now marching right to us. Those who are still loyal to Admiral Kolchak are ready to fight with these filthy traitors."

It appears that rebels have successfully killed Alexander Kolchak, our close ally, and General Diterikhs has become the new dictator. However, he was almost immediately counter-couped by Kolchak's ally, Georgiy Stark. Although he is Kolchak's political ally, we don't know for sure, if Stark will cooperate with us."

tram.84.t: "Anti-Kolchak Coup in Transamur!"
tram.84.d: "Admiral Kolchak, the long term leader of the Transamur state has been overthrown and assassinated by members of his own general staff. This was used by the democratic opposition to gain control over the state, effectively turning Transamur from a military junta into a democracy. How shall we react?"

tram.84.b: "Congratulate the new government!"

tram.86.t: "The Duma Elections"
tram.86.d: "After several months of preparations the provisional government has completed the arrangements for the first free election in Transamur since 1920.

tram.90.d: "Today, our colonial governor, General Yui Mitsui has died at the age of 79. A number of Japanese loyalists and toadies in the Vladivostok Duma have already called for the direct integration of our country into Japan, becoming a new prefecture of the Empire. However, their words are nothing but meaningless prattle. Everything depends on what Japan will decide to do with us."
tram.90.a: "Does it mean we are no longer independent?"

tram.91.t: "Yui Mitsui Dies"
tram.91.d: "Today, our governor in Transamur, general Yui Mitsuei died at the age of 79. Pro-Japanese politicians in Vladivostok Duma have called for Transamur to be made a new prefecture of our empire. Shall we accept their proposal?"
tram.91.a: "Indeed, integrate them."
tram.91.b: "Far too costly. Transamur will remain loyal under Semyenov."

tram.92.t: "Propose Reunification with Russia?"
tram.92.d: "With our chances of overcoming the might of Japan being slim, there have been calls from a number of leading figures within Transamur to set aside our previous rivalry with Russia and join them in order to stave off the Japanese threat. By proposing to join the Russian state peacefully, we could finally end years of isolation imposed on us by Kolchak's belligerence and hopefully avoid subjugation at the hands of Tokyo."
tram.92.a: "We must ensure our own survival. Send the proposal."
tram.92.b: "Are you crazy?"

tram.93.t: "Transamur Proposes Reunification"
tram.93.d: "It seems that the traitors in Transamur have finally realised the folly of their actions. Their miserable rump state is at war with Japan and they assuredly have no chance of victory in the face of Japanese military power. Representatives from Transamur have come to us begging us peacefully rejoin our nation, presumably in the hopes of avoiding conquest by Japan. Vladivostok is an important port, no doubt, but, are we ready to confront Tokyo yet?"
tram.93.a: "Welcome home Russians."
tram.93.b: "It's too risky..."

tram.94.t: "Transamur Reunifies with Russia"
tram.94.d: "It appears that the traitorous scum in Transamur have managed to temporarily escape their inevitable conquest by reunifying with Russia. Our pride demands retribution for their betrayal, but, is it wise to strike at Russia right now?"

tram.94.b: "Transamur isn't worth it."

tram.95.t: "Russia Refuses Unification"

tram.96.d: "The so-called "Russian Government" have refused to return our lands. Moreover, they have declared war on us and eager to retake Vladivostok."

tram.97.t: "The Russian Republic Breaks Away!"
tram.97.d: "The Russian Republic has decided to leave our sphere of influence and cease all contact with us! Our elaborate military-industrial stranglehold over them and their fetid regime lies in ruins, and it appears that our carefully laid plains for increasing our influence in the Russian Far-East are in tatters."
tram.97.a: "Destroy them!"
tram.97.b: "We can do nothing, for now."

tram.98.t: "Attempted Coup in Transamur"
tram.98.d: "News about anti-Kolchak coup in Transamur has recently reached us. It appears that rebels sought to kill Alexander Kolchak, our de-facto puppet leader of the Vladivostok regime, but their best efforts seem to have come to nothing, with the putsch crushed by loyalist guards. Still, Kolchak has made a number of enemies in Transamur and his vulnerability is becoming increasingly clear. Perhaps we should demand that Kolchak resign and assign a new, more pliant leader for Transamur."
tram.98.a: "Replace him."
tram.98.e: "Kolchak may be a loose cannon, but he's our loose cannon."

tram.100.t: "Admiral Kolchak Murdered in Transamur"
tram.100.d: "News about anti-Kolchak coup in Transamur has recently reached us. It appears that rebels have successfully killed Alexander Kolchak, our close ally, and General Diterikhs has become the new dictator. Although he is less brave and ambitious than his former political rival, Diterikhs still has great expansionist vision for Transamur. Perhaps we should try to coup him before he starts a geopolitical crisis?"
tram.100.a: "Greet the new government."

tram.102.t: "Admiral Kolchak Murdered in Transamur"
tram.102.d: "The leader of the 1925 coup, rogue admiral Alexander Kolchak was recently killed by his own soldiers during a military coup in his beloved Transamur state. A man of great ambitions, he had contested our rights to rule the Russian Republic until his last breath. With his death, our society become a bit more pacified."
tram.102.a: "So, the bastard is gone. Excellent!"

tram.103.t: "Transamurian Currency in Harbin"
tram.103.d: "Harbin is an important city, placed in the middle of Fengtian's territory, and connects two parts of the Chinese Eastern Railway which our republic sold to the Fengtian government in 1927. But even now lots of the Russians live there and play a significant role in the railway. Since many of them have bonds with us, they prefer to use the more or less stable Transamurian Ruble instead of the fluctuating Fengtian Tael, though its unclear if the transactions with our currency are legal or not. Our Economic Minister has proposed that we should make an agreement with Fengtian, which will allow the usage of the Transamurian Ruble in Harbin, but will permit additional taxation by the Fengtian Government."
tram.103.a: "Let's propose it!"
tram.103.b: "The current situation is acceptable."

tram.104.t: "Transamurian Currency in Harbin"
tram.104.d: "Transamur has proposed that we allow transactions between our own currency and the Transamurian Ruble in Harbin, which has the largest Russian population in the whole of the Northeast. The government in Vladivostok says that we will be able to tax these transactions, moreover such an agreement could have a positive influence the industrial development of the city as well as the region, where the local Russian business started to make various investments. But, some members of our government mention that the free use of the Transamurian Ruble can lead to the increase of Harbin's autonomy."
tram.104.a: "An agreement will help our economy."
tram.104.b: "We don't need this deal."

tram.106.d: "Too long we've been waiting for a chance to liberate our fellow Russians from the tyranny of corrupted German lapdogs and Bolshevik utopists. Our boys are ready to fight, guns are loaded, and trucks are fuelled. Should we officially declare war on them?"

tram.106.b: "We need another month to prepare an invasion."

tram.108.t: "Setbacks Against Transamur"
tram.108.d: "It seems that we have underestimated our enemies in Vladivostok. Their forces are rolling over Eastern Siberia defeating our troops and capturing the cities. Perhaps it would be wise to consider ceding the lands that they have claimed in exchange for peace between us?"
tram.108.a: "They're just wastelands anyway..."
tram.108.b: "No! It's just a temporary setback."

tram.109.t: "Russia Proposes Peace"
tram.109.d: "Our mighty military forces are rolling over Eastern Siberia, liberating cities and people from oppression. These cowards who dare to call themselves the Russian government appear to be willing to cede the lands we previously demanded from them. Should we sign a peace treaty or take advantage of Russian military weakness by continuing the war?"

tram.118.d: "Today, a major anti-Japanese rally was held in Vladivostok. Crowds of angry protesters have demanded that we end our partnership with Japan and expel their powerful delegation from our country. Special agents have already identified the agitators responsible for this demonstration. Though we should be attempting to crush these subversive elements, we could instead use them to reduce Japanese influence in Transamur."

tram.118.b: "They shall be useful stooges against Japanese dominance."

tram.119.t: "Japan Demands Transamur Control"
tram.119.d: "With Japanese influence growing every day, we can barely control the country. Today, the Imperial Delegation from Tokyo demanded that the leadership of Transamur resign and allow them to rule the Transamur, a harsh insult indeed. Though doing so would incur the wrath of the powerful Japanese military, we currently still have the opportunity to expel the Delegation and declare our total independence from Japan. The proud people of Transamur are not mere serfs and if we are going to die, we shall die defending our country from this naked imperialism!"

Now, with the political atmosphere somewhat cooler, the opportunity has finally come for Wojciechowski to choose a deputy to help rule his military cabinet. There are three candidates for this post: the current head of government General Semyenov; young and ambitious general Pepelyaev and conservative Admiral Stark. Though fresh blood may gives us a new opportunities, serious ideological differences exist between Wojciechowski and the more liberal Pepelyaev and Stark will potentially lead to tensions later."

tram.121.d: "After their victory in the Second Russian Civil war, the Reds have begun to terrorise their internal enemies. Many former White forces and their supporters have managed to flee from mainland Russia to join our cause against the Bolsheviks taking advantage of a period of instability and anarchy in Siberia to flee east. Along with soldiers, several well-educated officers have arrived offering their services. No matter their prior political affiliations, together we must strike at the Red Hydra!"
tram.121.a: "Welcome home, brothers!"

tram.122.t: "More Exiles Arrive in Transamur"
tram.122.d: "A long period of political instability in mainland Russia has caused anarchy to erupt in distant parts of Siberia. With the [RUS.Capital.GetName] regime otherwise occupied containing instability in the West, it is quite difficult for them to exert real power over this region. People are losing hope in their leaders and fleeing to our country. More and more refugees and exiles are joining our cause."

tram.123.t: "Send Agitators into Siberia"
tram.123.d: "With the death of Kerensky the political situation in Russia proper is more chaotic than it has been even in recent years. Some of our ministers believe that the opportunity now exists for us to strike again. We should start with sending agents to push our agenda all across the Eastern Siberia. If the people hear us it is inevitable that they will join with us to bring down the corrupt regime in the West."

Once Kolchak's ally, the monarch guaranteed his safety in 1925 until the British Revolution. His son, [CAN_king_first_name] has now ascended to the throne in Canada. Although, neither Kolchak or [CAN_king_first_name] know each other personally, this resetting of relations could be the start of a long period of partnership between our countries. We should send an envoy to negotiate for support."
tram.125.a: "Strong allies are always good."

tram.126.t: "Envoy from Transamur"
tram.126.d: "Today an envoy from the petty military junta of Transamur has come to visit His Majesty, [CAN_king_full_name]. In his speech, the envoy informed us about King George V's previous support of Kolchak's 1925 unsuccessful coup in Petrograd and assured us that this time the rogue admiral will triumph - however, he once again requests support from the Entente. We owe Kolchak nothing, but maybe he's not that useless? How should we answer?"
tram.126.a: "Assure him that he'll get everything he need."
tram.126.b: "Limited support will be enough."

tram.127.fullsupport: "Our envoy has returned with magnificent news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed a deep respect for our cause. The King has promised that we can rely on him for some degree of military support. It seems that the Entente is now an effective partner for our regime."
tram.127.partialsupport: "Our envoy has returned with good news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed a respect for our cause. However, though the King has promised to partially support us, he has refused to give us complete backing. While the outcome is not as great as we had previously hoped, some support from the Entente is most welcome."
tram.127.nosupport: "Our envoy has returned with unfortunate news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed little interest in our cause, to put it mildly. The King said bluntly that we are nothing but a clique of buffoons desperately trying to preserve our rule. He promised absolutely nothing from the Entente and our relationships has definitely worsened."

tram.127.c: "What a rude person..."

tram.128.t: "Vladivostok Treaty"
tram.128.d: "The war between Japan and Transamur seems to lose any reason it had before. Japanese troops, taking casualties form brave Russian defenders, were unable to conquer Vladivostok for so long time the entire perspective of taming Transamur may now cost more than Transamur can possibly give in return.\n\n[JAP.GetLeader] and [TRM.GetLeader] meets today in Vladivostok to sign a white peace treaty and end all hostilities between these two countries. It seems that Japan has lost its only tool to press Russia. People of Transamur are celebrating this outstanding victory."

tram.128.jap: "Curse you, traitors."

tram.129.t: "Moving the Capital to Irkutsk"
tram.129.d: "We now control Irkutsk which provides us with an industrial base to build up our country. In order to continue with our aspirations of a united Russia we must relocate the provisional capital to Irkutsk. This may alarm the Japanese as it would give them an indication of our true goal but it would also lower their influence"

tram.131.t: "Moving the Capital to Moscow"
tram.131.d: "Moscow hasn't been the capital of a united Russian State since 1712 when Peter The Great made what is now Petrograd the capital. Since the illegitimate Petrograd Regime used the city we should perhaps consider using Moscow as our new capital, not only to distance ourselves from the petrograd regime but as a callback to the foundation of Russia. "

Their influence - and, therefore, resistance is growing from day to day. But we give them what the Russian Republic never did - the widest autonomy. There are many of Oblastniki in the Council of Ministers, lobbying the separatist influences. Perhaps, we should finally start to limit this pathetic movement?"

While Kolchak considers current state of relations with Japanese a temporary and necessary measure to be strong, he understands that this position may be considered vulnerable and make his rule illegitimate in the eyes of common Russians. Nevertheless, we need this ties for now and it seems that we will have to cope with the Japanese influence until the Siberian Army enters Moscow."

This decision, however, opens new opportunities for us to finally unite with an unrecognized state in the Far-East. On the other hand, if we don't, some monarchist generals can join their government. Chkheidze has delivered a large speech in the Senate, where he theoretically justified that the restoration of Romanov Monarchy is necessary to achieve popular support of our government. He claims that with the Tsar back, our legitimacy can be secured and a long tradition of monarchy will continue.\n\nThe Senate, however, was divided on this issue. The ones stated that we should not move away from the Orthodox Eurasianist doctrine, but the others believed in Chkheidze's theses. With the prospect of peaceful union with the Far East on the line, his proposal is likely to be passed by the majority of the Senate. However, they can also listen to the opinion of Trubetzkoy and other founding fathers, who are unlikely to support Chkheidze."

tram.164.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to invest in our economy"
tram.164.a: "That's a good deal."

tram.165.t: "Canada Refused to Invest In Us"
tram.165.d: "The government of Canada has refused to invest in us. It has greatly damaged our relations. Perhaps, we should rely on Japan more?"
tram.165.a: "Damn."

tram.167.t: "Close Ties With Entente?"
tram.167.d: "We have great future in the Entente - our former allies during the Weltkrieg. While it is more profitable for us to cooperate with Japan, if we want to be recognized as a true Russian government, we should work with Entente."
tram.167.a: "Send them the treaty."

tram.168.t: "A Treaty From [TRM.GetNameDef]"
tram.168.d: "The government of [TRM.GetNameDef] is looking forward to cooperating with us. While it can be dangerous to cooperate with a Japanese ally and we should focus on Europe, we might recognize Transamur as an independent nation."
tram.168.a: "Sign the treaty."
tram.168.b: "Our answer is no."

tram.169.t: "[CAN.GetNameDef] Rejected"
tram.169.d: "The Canadian government has refused to cooperate with us."

tram.170.d: "The Canadian government has agreed to cooperate with us."
tram.170.a: "Splendid!"

tram.173.t: "The \"Varyag\""
tram.173.d: "The \"Varyag\" or the Varangian was once a Russian protected cruiser. It became famous for its crew stoicism and braveness during the Battle of Chemulpo Bay. As a seafaring nation, we should always remember the heroism of the Varyag crew."
tram.173.a: "We need to remember our history."

tram.175.t: "The Trial of the Socialists"
tram.175.d: "The leaders and organisators of the NSP, PLSR and RKP parties were the ones that brought our country to the Civil War in 1918 and the ones that continued to destabilize it in 1920s and 1930s. We should now decide - either we should go on with restrictions and bans or decide their fate once and for all - sentence them for treason."
tram.175.a: "Ban these parties"
tram.175.b: "Sentence their leaders"

tram.176.t: "The Trial of the ROVS"
tram.176.d: "The ROVS, organisation of White Generals, created by Lavr Kornilov and his closest allies was the force that prevented Russia from full democratization. Consisting of far-right adepts, monarchists and supporters of strong dictatorial power. If we allow them to operate, they will continue to promote rightist rhetoric, however, we will have a strong and sufficient army organisation."
tram.176.a: "Ban ROVS"
tram.176.b: "Allow them to operate - they can be useful."

tram.177.t: "The Trial of the PSR"
tram.177.d: "The Socialist-Revolutionaries was once the most popular party in Russia, that promoted many social reforms in our country. However, since Kerensky has proven to be a rather bad leader, many of the PSR members have turned away from him. On the other hand, most of them support even more radical policies that Kerensky was too afraid to implement. What shall we do?"
tram.177.a: "Ban PSR and sentence their leaders"
tram.177.b: "They have nothing common with Kerensky - leave them alone."
tram.177.c: "Just ban them - they can't do anything against us."

tram.1000.t: "An Offer from an Old Ally?"
tram.1000.d: "The rump state of Vladivostok actually won and now a government has been established to rule over Russia. Since we provided some aid in their bleak situation they have offered their assistance in the Entente."
tram.1000.a: "Their aid is vital, let them in!"
tram.1000.b: "Didn't they lose last time?"

tram.1001.t: "We Are Now a Member of the Entente"
tram.1001.d: "The British have decided to let us back into the Entente"
tram.1001.a: "We will avenge the fallen men from the first Weltkrieg"

tram.1002.t: "An Offer from an Old Ally?"
tram.1002.d: "The rump state of Vladivostok actually won and now a government has been established to rule over Russia. Since we provided some aid in their bleak situation they have offered their assistance in the Entente."

tram.1003.a: "We will avenge the fallen men from the first Weltkrieg"

tram.1004.t: "The Russian Republic has Taken one of our Client States"
tram.1004.d: "Russia has recently come out of a huge civil war where Transamur of all nations came out on top. This regime thinks that since it took all of Russia it can take our puppets, what should we do towards these traitors."
tram.1004.a: "We can't do anything about it"
tram.1004.b: "We will at least embargo them!"
tram.1004.c: "We can beat them again"

tram.1005.t: "Transamur Government Collapsed"
tram.1005.d: "The Russian Army has invaded Transamur and we have nothing left to do but withdraw our garrisons. Our business interests in Transamur are now unprofitable and detrimental."
tram.1005.a: "Too bad."

tram.200.t: "The Supreme Ruler of Russia"
tram.200.d: "Even during the Civil War, when hordes of bloodthirsty Bolsheviks were trying to throw Russia into chaos, Admiral Kolchak made an important and responsible decision - to become the Supreme Ruler of Russia before the convocation of the Constituent Assembly to unite the forces of the Whites in the fight against the Reds.\n\nThe barely maintained peace between the SRs, Kadets, and Military Generals lasted until the end of the war, and in 1920, after driving out the Bolsheviks, Kolchak, then-Prime Minister Sazonov, and Kerensky were forced to sign the Minsk Treaty. After some time, the second Constituent Assembly was convened, and Kolchak resigned from his position as the Supreme Ruler of Russia.\n\nBut the next 5 years changed everything. First, the ongoing Japanese occupation of Transamur, in which local businesses seized power, effectively turning Vladivostok into a Japanese colony. Secondly, the German \"occupation\" of Russian industry, approved by Kerensky in the name of economic prosperity. Third, the rampant left-wing forces, famine in the Volga region, indulgences for the peasants, alienation of the property of the rich.\n\nAll this led to the event known as the Kolchak Putsch of 1925. And now the admiral has once again taken on the furrows of the Supreme Ruler, leading the Russian State in exile, waiting for the chance to return to Moscow and finally restore order in Russia."
tram.200.a: "And now we are here..."

tram.201.t: "The NRA Partisan Warfare"
tram.201.d: "From the very moment when the Whites seized power in Siberia and the Far East, the Far Eastern People's Revolutionary Army (NRA), funded by the Bolsheviks, operated in the region. With the loss of the Bolsheviks, the NRA continued its activities, but completely went underground, periodically arranging political assassinations and attempts on high-ranking officials. 15 years later, the NRA is still active... and either the lack of DO-ROVS agents, or the incompetence of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks, or the lack of infrastructure, prevents the exposure and destruction of this terrorist group.\n\nIn addition, the NRA also distributes outright Bolshevik propaganda, which tries to radicalize the workers of the large industrial cities of the Far East: Chita, Khabarovsk, etc. We must identify and destroy all the underground branches of the NRA, get their leadership and execute them before they plunge the Far East into the chaos of Bolshevism."
tram.201.a: "The Bolshevism must eventually die out."

tram.202.t: "Merkulov Brothers"
tram.202.d: "Business circles in Vladivostok are the origins of such a state as Transamur. It was they, sponsored by the Japanese government, who declared the Transamur Protectorate. Everything changed in 1925, when the territory of Transamur radically increased, and in Vladivostok, in addition to them and the Japanese, the Siberian Army of Kolchak, the DO-ROVS, the Cossacks and the Siberian Regionalists appeared. Vladivostok, thus being the capital of Transamur, became a chessboard for all political groups of Transamur. And maybe Kolchak thinks that he is in charge here, but this is a mistake.\n\nAt the head of Vladivostok is the Japanese garrison of the Kwantung army, which guards the port of Vladivostok, and without its permission, no goods enter Vladivostok. But permission is very easy to get, especially if you belong to the Merkulov family - the richest entrepreneurs in the Far East. With a pocket Japanese garrison, the Merkulov brothers are trying not only to subdue the entire Vladivostok trade, but also politics with Spiridon Merkulov's National-Democratic Union being one of the largest allowed political parties in the Far-East."
tram.202.a: "Watch them closely..."

tram.203.t: "Political Bombings"
tram.203.d: "The NRA partisans are weakening the stability of our Motherland. Recently, one of them assassinated a famous General. God only knows who they will kill next time!"
tram.203.a: "I want the head of the bomber on my desk!"

tram.204.t: "Workers' Demonstrations"
tram.204.d: "Even though technological advancement resulted in a slow but steady improvement of working conditions, the workers remained very vulnerable to NRA agitation. Demonstrations in cities were organised from time to time, their demands varying depending on who was pulling the strings."
tram.204.a: "Oh well..."

tram.205.t: "Help With Fighting NRA?"
tram.205.d: "In war, all means are good, and to finally finish off the Bolshevik infection in the Far East, we can turn to one of the political groups loyal to us. There are only two options: the Semyenov Cossacks, who will easily deal with the partisans in their native lands, or the Diterikhs DO-ROVS-organized and disciplined military, who almost as much hate the Bolsheviks as we do."
tram.205.a: "We will need Semyenov's help"
tram.205.b: "We will need Diterikhs's help"
tram.205.c: "We will cope alone."

tram.206.t: "Crusade Against Bolshevism!"
tram.206.d: "General Diterikhs declared a crusade against Bolshevism. Armed not only with rifles and ammunition, but also with faith in our Savior Jesus Christ, the vigilantes of the Holy Cross are ready to destroy the cursed heresy of Bolshevism.\n\nDestroying any agitation and propaganda of the partisans of the people's Revolutionary Army, the Squads of the Holy Cross bring light to the uneducated masses of the Far East. Long live the new Inquisition! Long live General Diterikhs! Long live Admiral Kolchak!"
tram.206.a: "It seems NRA is doomed."

tram.207.t: "Cossacks, Armed With Japanese Rifles!"
tram.207.d: "The participation of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks in the suppression of the partisan war of the People's Revolutionary army brought not only good, but also suspicious rumors. Local residents say that the Cossacks who came to liberate them from the oppression of Bolshevism were armed with Japanese rifles, and some columns consisted of Fentian and Japanese officers. Of course, it is quite strange that the Cossacks are quietly walking around in the presence of foreign armed forces,but there is such a question. How can the locals even know what Japanese rifles look like?"
tram.207.a: "At least they fight NRA"

tram.208.t: "Siberian Regional Council"
tram.208.d: "For too long, we have promised to give the oblasts autonomy without doing anything. Not surprisingly, over the years, their discontent grew more and more. It's time to stop making promises and do something about it. We will form the Siberian Regional Council, or Sibsovet, which will be the authorized body of the Supreme Ruler in the lands with civil administration. This body will have supreme executive and legislative power in these regions, which, of course, will be limited only to the Supreme Ruler and the Council of Ministers."
tram.208.a: "Triumph of Siberian Regionalism!"

tram.210.t: "Zemsky Sobor"
tram.210.d: "In the city of Vladivostok, the Great Zemsky Sobor is held, under the leadership of Voivode Mikhail Diterikhs. In the conditions of the fact that our motherland is enslaved by socialist enemies, we are the last stronghold of the Russian people, who keep in their hearts a fervent love for the Dying Motherland!\n\nThe Zemsky Sobor makes the following decision:\n'Letter of the Amur Zemsky Sobor to the Russian People of the Great Russian Land': We call for national unity around the Vladivostok government, so that God will grant a single Sovereign Leader to the great-power Russian Land. We hand over the supreme power to the Romanov dynasty, so be it!\n\nUntil the arrival of the Russian Tsar in Vladivostok and his coronation as the current tsar of All-Siberia and the Tsar of All-Russia in exile, Mikhail Diterikhs, who was previously elected Voivode of the Zemsky Krai and the Zemsky Rat, will serve as regent. For this, the Sobor is concluded."
tram.210.a: "The Tsar Will Return!"

tram.211.t: "Merkulovs In Power"
tram.211.d: "The richest family in Transamur has finally seized power in the country, even through democratic elections. With Spiridon Merkulov as president and Nikolay Merkulov as prime-minister, both of them are looking with greed at restoring the ties with Japan and expanding their business interest. The Merkulovs are looking forward to enriching themselves rather than claiming to be the legitimate Transamur Government. But, perhaps, if they control all of Russia, they will be even more richer and powerful."
tram.211.a: "Stay in Vladivostok."
tram.211.b: "We are the legitimate Russian Government!"
TRM_MERK_tooltip: "§RWe won't be able to expand our territory and conquer Russia§!"

tram.212.t: "Supreme Ruler's Announcement"
tram.212.d: "Today, the Supreme Ruler of Russia, Aleksander Kolchak, announced to the Council of Ministers that in the near future he plans to dissolve the Sovmin and form a new government. Not to say that the news was received by the ministers with enthusiasm, as many of them suspected something was wrong. The main and most reasonable suspicions arose, of course, from Prime Minister Vologodsky, despite his long acquaintance and the position of prime minister in the very first Kolchak government during the civil war.\n\nKolchak does not have many options for forming a new government, but one of the key decisions is to remove regional officials from the government and replace them with either more loyal military or Cossacks, or, conversely, to form a government of 'people's trust'."
tram.212.a: "We'll see"

tram.213.t: "Tensions in Vladivostok"
tram.213.d: "Kolchak's statement, despite its seemingly routine in the political sphere, seems to have led to a crisis among ministers, which affected the overall stability of the country. The news about the formation of a new government has raised the ears of the whole of Vladivostok, and people are wondering who will become the new prime minister under the Supreme Ruler. In addition, citizens are afraid of Japan's interference in the decision of Kolchak. Against the background of small popular unrest and a sharp aggravation of distrust of the Supreme Ruler, slogans of free and fair elections are again heard on the streets."
tram.213.a: "Something is happening"

tram.215.t: "A Delegation From [FROM.GetNameDefCap]"
tram.215.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has sent us a foreign delegation, asking for an official recognition of our state as legitimate Russian government. The regime of the self-proclaimed Supreme Ruler of Russia may seem to us ridiculous, but if we are feeling free to oppose the Russian Government in Petrograd and Moscow, we can formally recognize [FROM.GetAdjective] independence."
tram.215.a: "We should not recognize this Japanese colony..."
tram.215.b: "They will have our recogniton"

tram.216.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Recognize Us"
tram.216.d: "The cowardly [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to recognize us and has sent our delegation back to Vladivostok. We'll see what will they do when the boots of the Siberian Army march through Moscow."
tram.216.a: "It's not our problems."

tram.217.t: "[FROM.GetName] Recognized Us"
tram.217.d: "A friendly government of [FROM.GetName] has recognized our government as the legitimate Russian government. This will bring a few more points to the Supreme Ruler's legitimacy in the eyes of the world community."
tram.217.a: "Splendid!"

tram.218.t: "The Trials Begin"
tram.218.d: "Our motherland, once again broken, bloodied and weak, and all through the fault of geeks like Kerensky, Milyukov and others, who sold our country to the Germans for the damned Reichsmark. But apart from them, the country is rotten through and through with socialist ideas that literally poison the air, and the army under the leadership of the incompetent Kornilov was simply ruined. It's time to restore order with a firm hand. May a fair and just trial take place!"
tram.218.a: "All rise for the Honorable Chief Justice"

tram.219.t: "Trial of the Bolsheviks"
tram.219.d: "Several dozen people who have been identified by us directly as members or former members of a group of Bolsheviks, also known as Reds, or Communists, are being tried in the case of a coup d'etat and an attempted coup d'etat. Some of them were not caught or managed to leave the border while the Siberian Army stormed Moscow, but some of the defendants could not escape a fair trial. So, the defendants in the case, Bukharin N. I., Zhukov G. K., Spiridonova M. A., Rykov A. I., and others, are accused of treason to the Motherland, as well as the creation of several party socialist organizations aimed at establishing the power of workers and peasants, as stated. Nevertheless, in fact, these groups of individuals planned to establish their own sole power, destroy and decompose the army, question and ostracize the patriots of the Motherland who still have honor, dignity and conscience. The court ruled. The guilt of the above-mentioned citizens has been proven, the decision of the court in cases of high treason is not subject to appeal or review. Taking into account the circumstances in the form of plans to overthrow specifically the regime of A. F. Kerensky, who was also declared a criminal posthumously, the court softens the decision and appoints a sentence of life imprisonment to the accused."
tram.219.a: "Fair enough."

tram.220.t: "Trial of the Socialists-Revolutionaries & Mensheviks"
tram.220.d: "The defendants in the case of anti-Russian actions aimed at destroying the state foundations have arrested several high-ranking persons who are somehow connected with A. F. Kerensky and the so-called Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, including V. M. Chernov, N. D. Avksentiev, and others. In addition, the leaders of the RSDLP party, or the so-called Mensheviks, who also took part in the Petrograd regime in one way or another, are also being investigated. Taking into account the past achievements of these politicians, including participation in the suppression of the Bolshevik putsch during the civil war, as well as alienation from the administration of the country by A. F. Kerensky, the court made the following decision. Given the mitigating circumstances, these persons are..."
tram.220.a: "Innocent!"
tram.220.b: "Guilty!"

tram.221.t: "Fate of the PSR & RSDRP"
tram.221.d: "Regardless of the court's decision in the case of the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, the fate of their parties remains open. On the one hand, they should be banned immediately, but it should be taken into account that the RSDLP represents the interests of the working class, and the AKP is one of the largest parties in the country, and their complete ban implies an unstable situation in the country. In addition, the interests of these parties are lobbied by Siberian regional officials, many of whom were directly or are members of these parties. A compromise solution would be to ban these parties, but instead create a pro-government party of workers and peasants, which will definitely not encroach on state power."
tram.221.a: "Ban these two remnants of the past..."
tram.221.b: "Create a new pro-Kolchak party instead."
tram.221.c: "Let them live..."

tram.222.t: "Fate of the KDP"
tram.222.d: "Despite the fact that the liberal party was not distinguished by rabid Russophobia, like the previous ones, its leader, Pavel Milyukov, was prime minister under Kerensky all the years of his reign, that is, in fact, he was the main person who allowed the rampant Germans and corruption in the country, so he should have been arrested and tried as a criminal, despite all his patriotism and whatever he said. The KDP party itself should pass into the hands of... more loyal people, like Viktor Pepelyaev, the leader of the Party of Constitutional Democrats of the Far East. However, maybe we should avoid past mistakes and ban all this rotten movement of liberals?"
tram.222.a: "Arrest Milyukov and make Pepelyaev leader of KDP"
tram.222.b: "Ban both KDP and KDV"
tram.222.c: "Let them live..."

tram.223.t: "Fate of the NRPR"
tram.223.d: "Boris Viktorovich Savinkov... he could become a very useful companion of Kolchak in his difficult path. However, he chose a different path. A former terrorist and a member of the Socialist - Revolutionary Party created his own party, but we must pay tribute to him-he also wanted to overthrow Kerensky as much as Kolchak. His party was opposed to the Germans and against Kerensky, and sought to revive the Russian people. However, he is still a socialist and has great ambitions, and it is at least risky to leave him free."
tram.223.a: "Arrest Savinkov and ban NRPR"
tram.223.b: "Let him live, but ban NRPR"
tram.223.c: "Let them live..."

tram.224.t: "Fate of Lavr Kornilov"
tram.224.d: "Russian generals are people with whom we fought side by side in the civil war, but who betrayed Russia for the sake of German subsidies. General Kornilov is a traitor who ruined the country and the army. Generals Wrangel and Denikin are his accomplices. Unfortunately, the last two managed to escape from the country, but General Kornilov remained, and now he is a defendant at a military tribunal. He is already an old man, so they will not treat him so harshly, and therefore the court sentences him to the highest penalty - execution by firing squad. With the death of General Kornilov, a shameful era in the history of the army will end."
tram.224.a: "An end he deserved."

tram.225.t: "Fate of the Unions"
tram.225.d: "The Petrograd regime under the leadership of the socialist Kerensky was undoubtedly full of various kinds of trade unions, allegedly protecting the rights of workers. In fact, they were hotbeds of socialism, Bolshevism and other anti-Russian heresy. The most important of them was the VTSPS under the leadership of the Menshevik Lozovsky, a traitor to the Motherland. We can completely ban the trade union movement in Russia, so that we no longer face strikes and protests. Another option is to put your people in the highest positions in these trade unions, as well as to de-socialize them so that they meet the interests of the country. Or we can leave everything as it is in the hope that in this way we will earn the trust of the working class."

All supreme power belongs to the Supreme Ruler of Russia and the Cabinet of the Council of Ministers appointed by him. In addition, the State Duma will be established, which has legislative functions, but any bill must be approved by the Supreme Ruler of Russia before it is adopted. In addition, the procedure for terminating the powers of the Supreme Ruler of Russia is also established - in the event of a serious illness, death or resignation, the head of the Council of Ministers will take his position until a special meeting is convened, at which a new Supreme Ruler will be elected."

And now is the time.\n\nDuring this long time, Siberia was just a field for experiments, resources and money were pumped out of it for the sake of Moscow and Petrograd, while Siberians only obediently waited for at least some compensation from the corrupt regime. Even 25 years ago, it was impossible to imagine that anyone would support Siberian regionalism in any way. However, now this movement has grown and Siberians met the Supreme Ruler as a Liberator from the oppression of corruption and injustice. For many years, the regionalists have been waiting and believing. And now they are waiting for a reward for years of humility."

Many soldiers, natives of Siberia, threaten to go over to the side of the rebels. We cannot allow the army to disintegrate during such a difficult period for us, so we have only two options - either to suppress the riots by force and threaten the deserters with a tribunal, or to raise their salaries and promise benefits in the future."

tram.401.d: "We must decide the fate of the traitor generals who sided with Kolchak in 1925. We can pardon them and allow them to serve in the Russian army, using their experience and combat skills, or try them as criminals and traitors to the state."
tram.401.a: "Let them serve the Motherland."
tram.401.b: "They should be tried for treason!"

tram.402.t: "Fate of Ataman Semyenov"
tram.402.d: "We have confirmed reports on Ataman Semyenov being a corrupted Japanese agent, who received weapons and money to coup Kolchak and make Russian Far East a Japanese colony. Even though we have pardoned other Transamur officers, the fate of this particular traitor should be very clear - death."
tram.402.a: "This is the right thing to do."

tram.403.t: "Fate of Atamans Gamov and Tolstov"
tram.403.d: "Ataman Gamov of the Amur Cossack Host and Ataman Tolstov of the Ural Cossack Host have joined Admiral Kolchak and are known to be close associates of Ataman Semyenov. They probably knew about his plans and therefore they cannot be trusted. However, we can still let them live, even reviving the Ural Cossack Host."
tram.403.a: "Let them live..."
tram.403.b: "No mercy for Semyenov's henchmen"

tram.404.t: "Fate of Admiral Kolchak"
tram.404.d: "Is this man an Admiral-traitor, or a hero of Russia? Who is Admiral Kolchak? The Russian Cincinnatus, who made a difficult choice during the civil war, and then again-for the sake of saving the Motherland and opposing Kerenshchina. Perhaps we should spare the admiral if he is willing to give up all claims to the title of Supreme Ruler and continue his naval service, as he has always wanted."
tram.404.a: "Let him serve his Motherland."
tram.404.b: "No, he will be tried for treason."

tram.405.t: "[TRM.GetName] Demands Our Annexation!"
tram.405.d: "The Vladivostok government has approached us with an ultimatum. They not only demand to return their lands in Altai region, but also control over our government. If we fail to solve this diplomatically, it is possible that [FROM.GetName] will invade us."

tram.405.b: "We will stand against Russian aggression!"

tram.406.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has surprisingly agreed to our offer, giving us a great advantage against the Petrograd regime!"
tram.406.a: "Great"

tram.407.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
tram.407.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer. Without access to Altai, we will stuck near Lake Baikal and our offensive will fail."
tram.407.a: "Time to end Mongolia!"
tram.407.b: "We are not really ready to fight them now."

tram.408.t: "The Question of the KVZhD"
tram.408.d: "The Chinese Eastern Railway, now under Mantetsu influence, should belong to us, which basically means occupying most of the Northern Manchuria. This will definetely be against Japanese interests in the region, but perhaps we will be able to do this without much interference from Tokyo."
tram.408.a: "Visit Tokyo for consultations"
tram.408.b: "This is just between us and the Fengtian"
tram.408.c: "Forget about it."

tram.409.t: "Transamur Interests in Northern Manchuria"
tram.409.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has visited Tokyo today in order to solve the Chinese Eastern Railway issue. While once part of the Trans-Siberian railway, it connected Vladivostok to the rest of the Empire, but now Transamur is in a dire need of control over this railway to supply their troops in preparation of the offensive against [RUS.GetName]. While their access to the railway is just half of the deal, they want a complete control over Northern Manchuria, which we cannot allow without any significant benefits for us."
tram.409.a: "They can have it, but we demand control over their government"
tram.409.b: "They can have it, but we demand significant concessions"
tram.409.c: "They can have it, but Mantetsu will be still in control"
tram.409.e: "We can only allow military access."
tram.409.f: "They should forget about Manchuria!"

tram.410.t: "Japan Demands Control Over Our Government"
tram.410.d: "The Japanese government has agreed to give us Northern Manchuria, but they demand control over our government, which will make us their colony, most likely. This means that we won't be able to have our independent foreign policy."
tram.410.a: "We can't allow this to happen"
tram.410.b: "It seems we don't have a choice."

tram.411.t: "Japan Demands Significant Concessions"
tram.411.d: "The Japanese government has agreed to give us Northern Manchuria, but with significant concession. First off, they will get full access to the Port of Vladivostok, Kamchatka and Okhotsk, literally closing our access to the Pacific Ocean."
tram.411.a: "This is too risky"
tram.411.b: "KVZhD is much important now."

tram.412.t: "Japan Agrees With Reservations"
tram.412.d: "The Japanese government has agreed to give us Northern Manchuria, but the Mantetsu will still be in control of the railway, which means that their influence will spread widely in our country."

tram.412.a: "This does not suit us really"

tram.413.t: "Japan Allows Military Access"
tram.413.d: "The Japanese Government has only agreed to give us military access to the Chinese Railway, without ceding any of the Fengtian territory."

tram.417.b: "Kwantung Army will protect us!"

tram.418.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"

tram.419.t: "Transamur Occupied Northern Manchuria!"
tram.419.d: "Without any notice, the [TRM.GetAdjective] troops have occupied Northern Manchuria, including the Mantetsu railway! This is unbelieveable! We should demand that they back down immediately!"

tram.420.t: "The Ultimatum From Tokyo"
tram.420.d: "The Japanese sent us an official ultimatum to withdraw from Northern Manchuria, before it's too late. They threaten us with a full-scale invasion if we don't leave the area and restore the border to the status-quo condition."

tram.422.t: "Japanese-[TRM.GetAdjective] Collusion"
tram.422.d: "Without any notification, the Japanese and [TRM.GetAdjective] governments have agreed on the latter occupying Northern Manchuria together with the Mantetsu railway. While Japan behaves like we are their colony, it seems we have no other choice but to accept these awful terms."

tram.423.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused our ultimatum, which will now lead to a full-scale war. We can always give it up, though risking our authority and ambitions severely..."

tram.10002.d: "With our rule in the Old Russian Far East being secured day by day, we have been greeted by the prospect of changing the city names from the old Kolchak regime to that of the honorable Chysanthemum Throne. While Japan-izing the Far East may take time, this change will be inevitable. Yet, there are still some in our lands who cherish the tyranny of old from the Russians, and it will undoubtedly anger those who still see themselves as heirs of the true Russia. Shall we make this brash move to further incorporate this land to Tokyo?"
tram.10002.a: "An excellent plan, damn the Russians."
tram.10002.b: "We mustn't act too brashly."

trmnra.1.t: "Workers' Unrest in Chita"

trmnra.3.a: "Protect Vladivostok!"
trmnra.3.b: "Shoot their leaders in Khabarovsk."

trmnra.4.t: "Streets of Vladivostok covered in blood."
trmnra.4.d: "We have definetely underestimated the NRA. Not only is it an armed militia, but they are also professional mercenaries. After Khabarovsk and Chita had fallen under the Red Banner, socialists tried to establish control over Vladivostok. We would have won easily, but the majority of the population seem to be dissatisfied with Kolchak's rule and they are stupid enough to join the bloody socialists. The streets of Vladivostok are now covered in blood."

trmnra.4.b: "The Captain goes down with his ship."

trmnra.5.t: "Victory of the Revolutionaries"

trmnra.60.t: "Admiral Kolchak Escaped"
trmnra.60.d: "During the coup in Transamur, Admiral Kolchak has escaped - as all cowards do. He lived a life of cowardice and it seems that even the Japanese could not save him."
trmnra.60.a: "Only cowards hide behind silence."

trmnra.40.d: "The NRA has definitely underestimated us. After workers rose up in Khabarovsk, we shot their leaders. The remaining militia and mercenaries went to Vladivostok in their miserable attempt to overthrow Kolchak, but the Army destroyed them. Soon after, workers in Chita gave up. The Transamur Lives and Marches On with its Supreme Leader - Admiral Kolchak."
trmnra.40.a: "Long Live Admiral Kolchak!"

trmnra.41.t: "Socialist Coup in Transamur"
trmnra.41.d: "One of our main allies - Transamur - has fallen under red banner of someone named Blyukher. It is absolutely correct that they will try to cut our economic ties with former Transamurian government. We could intervene directly or do nothing."

trmnra.41.b: "Do nothing."

trmnra.7.t: "Anti-Japanese Propaganda"
trmnra.7.d: "The Japanese influenced our country for too long, but there is one thing that Kolchak's corrupt government did not know. We hate Japanese and we want our independence. Moreover, we want independence for all workers that suffered under the Japanese boot."

trmnra.8.t: "Destroy Japanese Influence"
trmnra.8.d: "After the Revolution, we seized the means of production and prohibited private property, but it is not enough for destroying the Japanese influence completely.

trmnra.9.d: "The Region of Transbaikal is not only Semyenov Cossacks' den, but also a land of people who were always oppressed - Buryats. We respect the Buryat workers and we wish that they are free. They need the freedom that they never got from Emperor, Kerenskiy and Kolchak."
trmnra.9.a: "Promise them autonomy."

trmnra.10.t: "The Land of Buryat-Mongols"
trmnra.10.d: "We understand the pressing need of Buryat workers to become independent, but the region of Transbaikal was for a long time ruled by Ataman Semyenov - anti-Bolshevist scum, Japanese puppet and a coward. We never got him during the Civil War and he's likely to escape when we liberated Chita. But we should greatly increase garrisons at the border with Mongolia."

trmnra.11.a: "Join us or die."

trmnra.12.t: "The Czechoslovak Legion"
trmnra.12.d: "The Czechoslovak Legionnaries are one of the most dangerous organisations, operating in Transamur. Not only they are war heroes, they are also cruel and violent mercenaries. We should expel them from our country."
trmnra.12.a: "We will never forget their uprising during the Civil War."

trmnra.13.t: "Fate of Church"
trmnra.13.d: "The Russian Far-Eastern Orthodox Church has once supported Kolchak and his bourgeois policies. We should execute the priests and blow up churches or burn them to the ground."

trmnra.16.t: "The Last Bastion of Bolshevism"
trmnra.16.d: "With the defeat of the Reds in the Civil War, the lands of the first socialist republic in teh world has been a dangerous zone for socialists. Many of them escaped to France and other socialist nations, but some stayed. Our leader, Vasily Blyukher is one of them. And he will say with pride that the Far-Eastern Republic is the Last Bastion of the Bolshevism, but not the least.\n\nThis brings up a new discussion, however. Some consider that the Far-Eastern Republic in its current state is the only possible and durable way to prolong Bolshevism. So comrade Blyukher suggest that he should step down and invite comrade Krasnoschyokov lead a civilian government in the Far-East. The second choice, however, is to proclaim Russian Socialist Republic in-exile and try to restore the real Soviet power all across the Russia. The third choice, is to keep Transamur under military rule of Blyukher until further notion..."

trmnra.17.t: "A message from the Far-East."
trmnra.17.d: "The Far-Eastern Republic is asking to join us in a close union - but their leader, comrade Blyukher wishes to stay as the head of state. We respect those who fought against Kolchak and we should probably have a buffer zone between us and Japan."
trmnra.17.a: "Accept the deal."

trmnra.18.t: "`Transamur Has Cut Ties With Us!"
trmnra.18.d: "Transamur has announced today that they will cut ties with our empire and forge a new path, alone. This comes as a shock to many in Japan who view the state of Transamur as one of Japan's foremost colonies and allies. Regardless, we will not take this insult lightly."

tramsem.1.t: "Ataman Semyenov"
tramsem.1.d: "Ataman Semenov, the leader of the Transbaikal Cossacks, did not recognize the Kolchak government during the Civil War. After the founding of Transamur, he really wanted to join us, subjecting the entire Transbaikalia region to our jurisdiction. In the conditions of an actual civil war in the region, we can give Transbaikalia under the full control of Semenov. Temporarily, until he puts things in order there. We can be sure that Semenov will cope with the suppression of the troubles in Transbaikalia. However, there are rumors that Semyonov is coordinated by Japan, and Kolchak is concerned that Semyonov may rebel with the help of the Japanese. Something has to be done."
tramsem.1.a: "That's the best we can do now."

tramsem.4.t: "Turmoil in Transbaikalia"
tramsem.4.d: "The Trans-Baikal region is a springboard for constant resistance to the Kolchak regime. On the one hand, the region is home to the Buryat-Mongolian minority - the Buddhist people living here. During the civil war, the Buryat-Mongolian state existed for some time as an independent state. With the annexation of Transbaikalia to Transamur, the activities of the local Buryat-Mongolian self-government were suspended, but power in the region was still concentrated in the hands of civilian Siberian regionalists.\n\nIn addition to the Buryat Mongols and local regionalists, the lands of the Trans-Baikal Cossack army of Semenov are located in Transbaikalia and the NRA partisans are most concentrated.

State news agencies now report that a successor to Nikolay II has been crowned Tsar of all the Russians.\n\nWhile it is not known what the international priorities of this reborn Russian Empire are, or even if the coronation of the Tsar will calm the turbulent nation, numerous monarchs across the world have already congratulated the Romanovs on regaining their divine birth right."

trammlad.147.t: "The Union of Mladorossi"
trammlad.147.d: "The history of the "Young Russian" movement is inexorably tied to its leader, the charismatic aristocrat Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek, born in 1902 to a wealthy noble family of Azeri and Iranian origin. The three ideological phases of the Mladorossi can be closely mapped to Kazem-Bek's own life and experience; unsurprisingly considering his role as orator and ideologist. As a student activist, Kazem-Bek helped form the "Union of Young Russia" in 1923. Uniting 29 organisations and 4,000 people, the Young Russians represented the monarchist youth wing. Prone to intellectualism and ideologically vague, its members jointly rejected reactionary Tsarism in favour of a "new and dynamic vision". As secretary, Kazem-Bek met with Professor Nikolai Ustryalov, once head of the press bureau under Admiral Kolchak. Ustryalov convinced the young aristocrat to throw his support behind the putsch against President Kerensky in 1924. Both fled to Transamur following the coup's failure, taking their respective supporters along with them. Ustryalov became disillusioned with the White movement, and began idolising the Bolsheviks as defenders of Russian sovereignty.\n\nThe formation of the "Union of Young Russians" in 1925 marked the second ideological phase of the Mladorossi. Kazem-Bek began formulating his thesis of the "Labor Monarchy" under Ustryalov's tutelage. The nascent ideology of the Mladorossi combined an absolute monarchy, Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". During this period of 1925-1933, most Mladorossi were united only by theatrical oath-swearing ceremonies and readership of journals such as "Vivacity!" and "Towards Young Russia". The third phase occurred shortly after Kazem-Bek's travels to the Syndicalist nations of Europe. Kazem-Bek was particularly inspired by the proto-Totalism of the French & Italian national syndicalists, as well as the British Mosleyites. On his return, Kazem-Bek formed the "Mladoross Party" in 1934 as its "Vozhd". His ideas on how to organise the Young Russian State have coalesced into a single-party corporatist model under a Worker-Monarch.\n\nWith a strict party structure and growing paramilitary wing, Kazem-Bek hopes to achieve control of Transamur, and then his beloved homeland, Russia."

trammlad.148.t: "The All-Russian Nationalist Movement"
trammlad.148.d: "The All-Russian National-Revolutionary Labour Worker-Peasant Party of Nationalists, or as they're commonly referred to, All-Russian Nationalist Movement or the Natsionalisty, are an ultranationalist political organization who in recent years have become increasingly popular among the citizens on Transamur. Formed in 1931 by local politician and Kolchak loyalist, Anastasiy Vonsyatsky, the Natsionalisty have found support amongst Manchurian Russians and monarchist exiles. Young emigres still loyal to the ideals of a Russian Tsardom have flocked to this movement in awe of Vonsyatsky’s fiery speeches denouncing Bolshevism, Kerensky and Western Capitalism. All of which he accuses of degenerating the Russian people whilst declaring loyalty to Admiral Kolchak, the Russian Orthodox Church and a restored Tsardom. Espousing the homegrown ideology of “True Russian Nationalism”, the Natsionalisty have organised its members into a paramilitary force known as the, Black Vanguard, undoubtedly a reference to the Black Hundred.\n\n The Black Vanguard have provided security to Kolchak’s regime and have engaged in rounding up political dissidents as well as prominent members of the Jewish Vladivostok community accused of promoting ''dangerous foreign ideologies''. Admiral Kolchak has allowed for these actions to take place without officially endorsing the movements, perhaps to appease the Japanese authorities wary of an anti-foreign movement."

trammlad.149.d: "Due to a lack of interest by the mainstream Tsarist claimants, Alexander Kazem-Bek has been forced to improvise, and declare himself Interim Regent until a proper Tsar can be crowned. This move has proved to many that the Mladorossi is nothing but a joke and has greatly damaged our legitimacy in the eyes of the Russian people. But, Kazem-Bek still holds out hope that a Romanov Claimant will approach us and let us crown him Tsar. However, one positive is that Kazem-Bek’s position has never been stronger, as there is no Tsar that reigns technically above him; even though the Tsar would hold little real power. However, for now the People’s Tsardom of Transamur will have to remain a Tsardom in name only."

These titans of men represent the strength required to restore the Russian Tsardom, but these men are no elitist sycophants that have previously stood behind a Tsar. The Blueshirts are composed of rugged working-class proletariat workers who have evolved out of the brawls in the streets of Vladivostok and into disciplined soldiers waving the banner of Russia and the Mladorossi.

He rejected the spiralling crash brought upon by bickering factions of lifeless hordes eager to tear eachother apart in the name of power and greed! Kazem-Bek rallied those fellow brave nationalists and together they defeated the enemy within! Russia has ascended beyond its stagnant state, no longer the sickman of the globe.

But that was just the beginning. The beginning of the end of the Mladorossi.\n\nVery soon, mass purges began. Not limiting themselves to dismissals, the Nationalists began to arrest Mladorossi, and the leaders of local units, according to rumors, were executed without trial.

Keeping a large personal menagerie of various tortoise and turtle species in his home all scattered about in different ponds, gardens, and tanks around the estate, Vonsiatsky adores the small creatures, and has picked up a rather odd hobby relating to them. \n\nThough it is sometimes normal for people to paint the shells of their pet turtles, our Vozhd has taken it further, painting the globus cruciger symbol of the Mladorossi movement on their shells and parading them around as party mascots. Our Vozhd has taken this so far that he even wears a small turtle pin on his lapel and brings a few of these painted propaganda turtles along with him wherever he goes to spread the message and notoriety of our new creed.

The Russian nation has risen. But it's damp and cold in the shadow of the Turtle.

trammlad.528.d: "The distrust of the Japanese community within our nation has always been known, and the Natsionalisty has been furthering this by branding the Japanese as traitors in hiding, agents of a foreign government and those who are keeping the Russians down with their control of the banks. These rallies and speeches acted as a gas canister being poured onto wooden logs before a fire, with uniformed members of the Natsionalisty organizing marches through Japanese settlements and drawing the rising sun on Japanese owned businesses, identifying to the entire city who it was owned by. \n\nThis was the beginning of course, with the gasoline only needing a spark to be lit, and today that spark has been provided. The distant horizon held a shadow play of flames and smoke coming from the burning Japanese homes, where their businesses were set aflame by Natsionalisty crowds and people out in the street at the time were beaten savagely. The night proved to be long and terrifying to those sheltering down in their homes, hoping fire would not be lit to them. At long last however, the crowds dispersed and the military appeared, initially thought to be restoring order, but they ended up proving to be a bitter end to the Japanese community that greeted them when they ordered them to mount trucks. They were being relocated for their own ‘safety’, safety that would just so happen to be conveniently located across the border outside Russia."

trammlad.530.t: "SLAVA!" 
trammlad.530.d: "Anastasy Vonsyatsky, the Vozhd of our great nation, and why would he not be? This is the man who restored our nation to greatness. He himself fought against the red menace years ago, and even after that work was done decided to continue his efforts against the poison that is bolshevism by organizing the Natsionalisty here in Vladivostok. Preaching the truth of what is necessary to return Russia to greatness and defeat the Germans, Japanese and the Red menace that lurks in the shadows. Now the Tsar himself sits restored, a feat we only have to thank Anastasy for! \n\nSo for this, the nation must be thankful. Within the streets of our capitol sit great portraits of Vonsyatsky, Our nation’s families thanking him for their bread while our troops shall have thoughts of what he has done for our nation while they fight for it. There shall not be a moment where our people are not reminded of what he has done for them and his greatness, as school children shall sing songs of his deeds while aspiring to be able to prove their loyalty to a man they have everything to be grateful for, because who else would give the children of our nation an education, if not for the Vozdh? Everyone who loves their nation and the rebirth it has undergone shall cheer thrice these increasingly common words." 
trammlad.530.a: "Hail Vozhd!"

trammlad.531.t: "Russia's Ascendency..."
trammlad.531.d: "“Russia was a land that had lost its identity, its morals and its spirit. A decaying corpse of a once great empire, a truly sad state for any patriot of the motherland... However not all was lost! In Russia’s darkest hour there stood one man who would not go quietly into that good night. Anastasiy Vonsyatsky held within him a fiery passion that struck a light in the minds and souls of working patriots across the Russian lands. He rejected the spiralling crash brought upon by bickering factions of lifeless hordes eager to tear eachother apart in the name of power and greed! The Vozhd rallied those fellow brave nationalists and together they defeated the enemy within! Russia has ascended beyond its stagnant state, no longer the sickman of the globe. The heart of Russia is the heart of the Natsionalisty, the movement has become Russia’s new identity. And as Vonsyatsky’s fearsome rhetoric grows ever more dominant over the minds of many, so does Russia. The future belongs to us comrades!“\n\n- Front page of today’s edition of the 'Nationalist' newspaper"

### New Kolchak Focuses ###
TRM_Kolchak_Doc: "Supreme Ruler"
TRM_Kolchak_Doc_desc: "Kolchak claims himself to be the "Supreme Ruler of Russia". For our leader to bolster his image, he needs a strong propaganda machine to help foster an effective cult of personality. Everyone should know about his glorious persona and great deeds. Kolchak must be seen as Father of the Nation in the eyes of his people."

TRM_Semyonovtsy_Issue: "Semyenovites Issue"
TRM_Semyonovtsy_Issue_desc: "Ataman Semyenov, head of the Transbaikal Cossacks has supported the Kolchak Putsch, and helped us to annex Transbaikal region. However, we are not sure, if he is truly dedicated to our cause, as there are rumors he is secretly supported by the Japanese."

TRM_Limit_Cossack_Autonomy: "Limit Cossack Autonomy"
TRM_Limit_Cossack_Autonomy_desc: "The Cossacks possess a lot of power and influence in the regions of their Hosts and Kolchak believes that their power should be limited. While this will make Cossack even less loyal to us, we can be sure that they don't do any power abuse."

TRM_Expand_Cossack_Rights: "Expand Cossack Rights"
TRM_Expand_Cossack_Rights_desc: "The Cossacks are loyal allies of our regime and we must expand their rights even more to ensure their loyalty to our state."

TRM_Crush_NRA: "Crush the NRA"
TRM_Crush_NRA_desc: "The People's Revolutionary Army is the main threat to the existence of our country. The socialists try to undermine the state by terror tactics, but hopefully their recent activities have betrayed them. The Kolchak's Secret Service already knows their location and is ready to strike."

TRM_Appease_The_Workers: "Appease the Workers"
TRM_Appease_The_Workers_desc: "We shall increase the wages to the workers and make our government look more legitimate and friendly towards the Proletariat. Hopefully, this will help to damage NRA popularity."

TRM_Austerity_Measures: "Austerity Measures"
TRM_Austerity_Measures_desc: "The Workers are always a problem, because they are likely to listen to some stupid revolutionary ideas. They shall work for our state without criticizing our government. Any suspicious activities will be brutally supressed. "

TRM_Siberian_Industrialization: "Siberian Industrialisation"

TRM_Deal_With_Oblastniki: "Deal With Oblastniki"
TRM_Deal_With_Oblastniki_desc: "The Oblastniki have been a lump in the throat of Kolchak's State for a long time now. When Kolchak became a leader of Transamur, he promised a wide autonomy to Siberia as soon as it will be controlled by Kolchak's White Guard. The moment has come. Though Kolchak knows about his promises, the Oblastniki are the ones that support liberals and socialists - our main enemies. Oblastniki are becoming more and more pretentios and, therefore, dangerous to us."

TRM_Siberian_Regional_Council: "Siberian Regional Council"
TRM_Siberian_Regional_Council_desc: "Once some of the Siberian Regionalists supported Kolchak's Claims in exchange for Autonomous Siberia as soon as it will be fully controlled by the Siberian Army. Kolchak is a man of honour and he understands that without the support of Oblastniki he would never succeed in his plans of becoming a Supreme Ruler of All Russia. We should establish a Siberian Regional Council that will be responsible for all civilian issues, though making our country more decentralized."

TRM_Self_Government_Minorities: "Self-Government Of Minorities"
TRM_Self_Government_Minorities_desc: "The minorities of Buryats and Yakuts desire to have more autonomy. We believe that we shall create some autonomous regions in respective territories to appease them and Oblastniki and to increase our popularity."

TRM_Martial_Law_In_Minority_Areas_desc: "The regions of Buryatia and Yakutia, which are under control of Oblastniki and local minorities' authorities, are less stable and less under the control of the Siberian Army. We should invoke the martial law and curfew in these territories and put them under the direct control of our military."

TRM_Stake_On_Military: "Stake On Military"
TRM_Stake_On_Military_desc: "Though we were supported by Diterikhs and the DO-ROVS, their loyalty is still questionable. Kolchak is fearing that Diterikhs will try to coup his government should the Supreme Ruler become more liberal in his policies. Nevertheless, our country won't succeed without the help of the DO-ROVS divisions."

TRM_Elite_Siberian_Squadron: "Elite Siberian Squadron"
TRM_Elite_Siberian_Squadron_desc: "The Siberian Army in its current state has much more advantages fighting a land war in Siberia that the divided and inefficient army forces of the Petrograd Regime. We should continue developing our forces as Elite Siberian forces that will easily rush through Siberian Taiga to the Ural Mountains."

TRM_Obligatory_Conscription: "Obligatory Conscription"
TRM_Obligatory_Conscription_desc: "While the Siberian Army is by no doubt the most effective force to fight a land war in Siberia, it is too small in terms of numbers. We should raise the conscription and make it obligatory, so that we can have a large army of loyal soldiers."

TRM_Legacy_of_the_Whites: "Legacy of the Whites"
TRM_Legacy_of_the_Whites_desc: "Kolchak's Government is the only legitimate government in the vast territories of Mother Russia. We will never forget how much had he strived against the Bolshevist threat. We should remember and value the heroic achievements of the White Movement."

TRM_Pogranichniki: "Border Detachments"
TRM_Pogranichniki_desc: "We have great natural borders with the Petrograd Regime of the Lake Baikal and Patom Highlands, but they are not enough. We should establish highly-secured borders with constant presence of border detachments and even build some forts in case our enemy attacks."

TRM_Invest_In_The_Pacific_Fleet: "Invest In the Pacific Fleet"
TRM_Invest_In_The_Pacific_Fleet_desc: "The Pacific Fleet is the only institute and force the Supreme Ruler trusts. The so-called Moryaki are loyal and trustful men who will support Kolchak in any case. Nevertheless, we should invest in the Pacific Fleet by increasing wages for sailors and building new ships."

TRM_Ensure_Czech_Legion_Loyalty: "Ensure Czech Legion Loyalty"
TRM_Ensure_Czech_Legion_Loyalty_desc: "The Czechoslovak Legionnaries have supported Kolchak during the Civil War, but they are stuck in the foreign land for decades and now are somewhat a paramilitary force with no political preferences. But this is only how they position themselves. We should be totally sure that in some emergency case they don't betray us."

TRM_The_Japanese_Qustion: "Draw Closer to Japan"
TRM_The_Japanese_Qustion_desc: "The Russian State has been under the economic and military protection of Japan for more than a decade. We shall trust our friends from the islands, though losing some sovereignity at least for now, or we are doomed."

We must secure our sovereignity from the foreigners and support our businessmen ourselves."

TRM_Seek_For_Entente_Support: "Seek Entente Support"
TRM_Seek_For_Entente_Support_desc: "Years have passed since the ties between Russia and Entente were cut. Though they have supported our government for a while in the Civil War, their help has ended as soon as the Kerensky's government of pro-German bootlickers consolidated its rule. We should show the British King that Russia is still here and is still a loyal ally."

TRM_North_Pacific_Trade_Route: "North Pacific Trade Route"
TRM_North_Pacific_Trade_Route_desc: "With the ties with Canada restored, we should establish an official North Pacific Trade Route and perhaps build a better port in Kamchatka as the entry to the Okhotsk Sea can be blocked by the Japanese."

TRM_Japanese_Arms: "The Japanese Arms"
TRM_Japanese_Arms_desc: "As our military production is still in a dire situation, we must rely on Japanese Arms to provide our army with weapons."

TRM_Open_British_Embassy: "Open British Embassy in Vladivostok"
TRM_Open_British_Embassy_desc: "Though we were always in good relations with Canada, they still had no representation on the Far-Eastern soil. We should open an embassy in Vladivostok to ensure better relations between our countries."

TRM_Kolchak_Mil: "Vladivostok Arsenals"
TRM_Kolchak_Mil_desc: "The world is entering an era of global crisis and war unlike any seen in history, even including the Weltkrieg. This war will no doubt test our spirits, so we must be prepared. We must expand our facilities to produce even more equipment."

TRM_Far_Eastern_Business_Zone: "Far-Eastern Business Zone"
TRM_Far_Eastern_Business_Zone_desc: "Because of our efforts we made the port of Vladivostok one of the most vital ports in the North Pacific. Other countries in the Region would like to invest in us, so we will become richer and prosper."

TRM_Form_A_New_Cabinet: "Form A New Sovmin"
TRM_Form_A_New_Cabinet_desc: "It’s obvious that there were ministers that, if not sypathetic, were outright supportives of the coup. To make sure that it can’t happen again the cabinet needs to be reshuffled."

### New NATIONALISTS ###
TRM_Nationalists_Take_Over: "Natsionalisty Take Over" 
TRM_Nationalists_Take_Over_desc: "Having only gained more influence in the government and in the heart of the people, the Natsionalisty have finally made their power play against the government to seize control for themselves."

TRM_Destroy_Mladorossi: "Destroy Mladorossi" 
TRM_Destroy_Mladorossi_desc: "Although they once were allies to us, their ideals were just too niche, too far gone to be able to bring into our government in any way. We must ensure they do not hold a grudge and attempt to retake power by destroying them and scattering the pieces into the sea."

TRM_Union_With_Mladorossi: "Union With Mladorossi" 
TRM_Union_With_Mladorossi_desc: "Just because we seized power does not mean we must do away with our former allies, for they prove adept at winning over the hearts and minds of the citizenry and common man. We can utilize this unifying charisma."

TRM_Contact_DO_ROVS: "Contact DO-ROVS" 
TRM_Contact_DO_ROVS_desc: "It would pay us well if we were to establish connections with those old generals and nationalists within Petrograd and Moscow who might align alongside our beliefs, or at least hope to undermine those who continue to oppose both our causes."

TRM_Forget_Former_Confederates_desc: "Despite our leader being former brother’s in arms with the confederates of Denikin’s white army, we must solemnly accept the truth that they are not accepting of the tides of change. Those old fighters do not fit the profile of our ideology, and only fight for the old ideals."

TRM_Talks_With_ROVS: "Ally Former Confederates" 
TRM_Talks_With_ROVS_desc: "Our leader, Vonsyatsky had taken up arms against the Bolsheviks in 1917, where he joined with Denikin’s Volunteer Army and fought the reds all across the western reaches of Russia. \n\nNow it’s time to gather up our former colleagues and establish contact with the volunteer army commander, Denikin himself.

TRM_Arrest_Treacherous_Cossacks: "Arrest Treacherous Cossacks" 
TRM_Arrest_Treacherous_Cossacks_desc: "There are still roaming bands of cossacks within our nation that threaten to overturn our rule.

TRM_Eradicate_Japanese_Influence_desc: "There still remain Japanese settlements and business men within the confines of Vladivostok, where they continue to undermine our civilian order and hope that one day their homeland’s naval vessels will come to conquer rightful Russian lands.

TRM_Restructure_Bureaucracy: "Restructure Bureaucracy"
TRM_Restructure_Bureaucracy_desc: "The bureaucrats of the old Petrograd regime are nothing but Kerenskyite traitors and incompetents hostile to the Suprem Leader!

TRM_Amur_TITLE: "§LThe Region of Amur connects the Transbaikal region with the rest of the Far-Eastern territory by making it a strategically important region for Kolchak Government. Kolchak ensured the control of the Transsiberian Railroad in Amur Region with the help of the DO-ROVS, which made town of Rukhlovo a military base. Even though the governmental forces are controling the majority of Amur region, the NRA partisans are also active here, trying to gain control over the Rukhlovo for years without any success.§!"
TRM_Bodaybo_TITLE: "§LLocated in the Patom Highlands, Bodaybo was once known to be a perspective gold-mining region in Eastern Siberia, but in 1915 the area was cut off from the supply centers and as a result, gold production by 1921 decreased tenfold.\nWhile Kolchak's government tried to boost the gold industry in the region, it is still highly inefficient and the local civilian government takes about 80% of the gold to improve the area, providing the central authorities with almost no profit.§!"
TRM_Blagoveschensk_TITLE: "§LCity of Blagoveschensk, having the same name as the region, is a gradually developing and industrializing city, a large and important river port. It is known to once become the capital of the Amur Labour Socialist Republic during the Civil War and the socialist sentiments are still strong here. Moreover, the region is a home to the Amur Cossack Host.\nThe city, same to Rukhlovo, is under the control of the DO-ROVS detachments aimed to bring peace and order in the region.§!"
TRM_Buryatia_TITLE: "§LRegion of Verkhneudinsk, named after the largest city in the area, was a great battlefield during the civil war: events, that significantly determined the current affairs in the region. Verkhneudinsk, bordering Irkutsk region of Russia is in a state of constant war preparations and increased border security, maintained by the joint forces of Kolchak and Cossacks. At the same time, the region has a local civilian government of Oblastniki and Buryats, who view Verkhneudinsk as their native and rightful home.\nMoreover, the region is filled with NRA partisans who try to provoke and sabotage either of the present political groups.§!"
TRM_Chita_TITLE: "§LChita is a large transport hub, which brings together a lot of Far-Eastern workers and, therefore, NRA partisans. What is more, local Chita Oblastniki are also a powerful force in the region, who are engaged in the power struggle with the local Master of Chita...\nThe region is under an undisputed control of Ataman Semyenov, who constantly terrorizes NRA and Oblastniki and builds a strong Cossack Host. Even though Kolchak needs Semyenov's support, he does not know about his real intentions and Japanese ties.§!"
TRM_Kamchatka_TITLE: "§LBeing the easternmost part of the Eurasian continent, Kamchatka is the 'godforsaken place'. Despite being such a notorious place, it still has some benefits, regarding fishery. Moreover, the Vladivostok Business circles and the Japanese are investing much resources into city of Petropavlovsk, trying to build a new seaport and a shipyard.§!"
TRM_Kurily_TITLE: "§LThe Kuril Islands which were a part of the Japanese Empire since 1875, despite being an absolutely useless region at first glance, is strategically important for the Pacific Fleet. The Vries Strait between the islands is the only ice-free strait, which allows the Pacific Fleet to leave the Okhotsk Sea for the Pacific Ocean.§!"
TRM_Khabarovsk_TITLE: "§LThe Region of Khabarovsk was one of the main battlefields during the Civil War. Right now the Ussuri Cossack Host is located here, though its power is very limited due to the fact, that Khabarovsk is located in the so-called 'core Transamur'. The private sector and industry in the city is monopolized by Vladivostok Business Circles, which helps the NRA to bolster socialist sentiments in the region. Even though Khabarovsk is under military control of Kolchak's government, it also has the presence of the Japanese and Fengtian garrisons that ensure regular trading on concessional terms with Vladivostok Business Circle.§!"
TRM_Magadan_TITLE: "§LThe City of Okhotsk was once the main base the main base on the eastern borders of Russia for the flotilla and ships of the Russian-American Company and later became the cradle of the Pacific Fleet. However, the glorious times have passed and now Okhotsk is nothing more than another 'godforsaken place' in the middle of Siberian nowhere. Despite Okhotsk desolation, the Pacific Fleet is still there and is still loyal to the Supreme Ruler and Admiral, making it a cherry on the cake for the Japanese Empire.§!"
TRM_Nikolayevsk_TITLE: "§LDespite the fact that Nikolaevsk is a fairly small city located at the mouth of the Amur River, it is the center of gold mining in the entire Russian Far East and the second most important Far Eastern port.\nThough initially under the Japanese Intervention protection, right now the city of Nikolayevsk and the entire region is the main strongold of the DO-ROVS. Under firm hand of General Diterikhs, the region is becoming a new center of Russian Orthodoxy with radical Holy-Cross divisions being formed from citizens who are willing to fight in the Great Crusade Against... anything Diterikhs deems enough unspiritual§!"
TRM_Vladivostok_TITLE: "§LAh, Vladivostok, the Pacific gate of Russia!\nThe capital city of the Far East is perhaps the only place in the country where its fate is decided. With the Port of Vladivostok under occupation of the Japanese forces and Vladivostok Business Circle, the administrative buildings under 'occupation' of Kolchak Government, the military bases under control of the DO-ROVS, only streets and factories are left, where people are talking only about freedom and equality, inspired by the local Oblastniki and underground NRA resistance.§!"
TRM_Primorye_TITLE: "§LPrimorye, despite being close to the capital city is much less developed, with the Kolchak loyalist forces spread across the region, trying to restore order. The influence of the Japanese and Vladivostok Business is as high here, as in the city of Vladivostok.§!"
TRM_Sakhalin_TITLE: "§LThe island of Sakhalin was under full Japanese occupation since 1920, making 'Karafuto' one of the bastions of the Japanese forces. The Sakhalin region is not only rich in fish, forest and coal, but also in something, very precious - Oil. As long as Sakhalin is ours, we can be sure that we have cheap fuel for the Pacific Fleet§!"
TRM_Yakutia_TITLE: "§LYakutia, the land of native Yakuts has a long and complex story of relations with Kolchak government. When in November 1918 Yakutia was captured by Kolchak's troops, the local Yakuts never received the autonomy they wanted and anti-Kolchak rebellion succeeded in December 1919. However, the Civil War soon came to an end, bringing back the civilian republican government, which still did nothing with desired Yakut Autonomy. Everything changed in 1925 when Oblastniki seized the initiative and joined the Far-Eastern Republic, establishing Yakut Autonomous Republic. Though Yakutia still stays anti-Kolchak, they will not tolerate his suzerainty over their territory.§!"

TRM_Navy_Start: "Eastern Harbour"
TRM_Navy_Start_desc: "Vladivostok was both a major port and city in the Russian Far East under the old Tsarist regime, but with the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war, Vladivostok has lost some of its importance. After the Weltkrieg and Kolchak's unsuccessful coup in 1925 the city underwent a resurgence again as major trade port for the Japanese."

TRM_Navy_Vlad: "Improve Vladivostok Port Authority"
TRM_Navy_Vlad_desc: "Increasing numbers of ships make landfall in our port each week, and Vladivostok harbour has become overloaded due these endless waves of cargo ships. We shall expand the port in order to ease these issues."

TRM_Navy_Doc: "Pearl in the East"

TRM_Navy_Ships: "The Grand Fleet"
TRM_Navy_Ships_desc: "Since the Russian defeat in the Russo-Japanese war the Pacific fleet became a living example of misery. As the legitimate government of Russia it is our duty to restore the former glory of our Pacific fleet."

TRM_Navy_Docks: "Pearl in the East"
TRM_Navy_Docks_desc: "Vladivostok is our great pearl. We must do everything to make our city the powerhouse of East Asia. Our efforts will results in bigger naval facilities and stronger naval fortifications."

TRM_Navy_Old_Ways: "Legacy of the Weltkrieg"
TRM_Navy_Old_Ways_desc: "A lot of time has passed since the end of the Weltkrieg. Naval thought has changed and new technologies such as carriers and submarines have experienced much development. Still, these frivolous new toys are nothing compared to the old warships. A powerful fleet would crush anything in its path."

TRM_Navy_Cruiser: "Develop Cruisers"
TRM_Navy_Cruiser_desc: "We are not ready to construct big battleships, so it would be wise to focus on smaller ships such as cruisers. They are one of the keys to naval domination and a worthy initial goal for our fleet."

TRM_Navy_DD: "Destroyers of Amur"
TRM_Navy_DD_desc: "Destroyers are small fast ships which are produced to escort trade convoys and bigger ships. Although they aren't the pinnacle of warships in terms of tonnage and power we cannot afford to ignore them."

TRM_Navy_New_Ways: "A New Path"
TRM_Navy_New_Ways_desc: "The rise of submarines and carriers during the Weltkrieg was unexpected. They have since proven themselves to be very effective. Though we will likely still rely on our extant main fleet, perhaps we could augment it with these new types of ships?"

TRM_Navy_Sub: "Submarine Effort"
TRM_Navy_Sub_desc: "These sneaky machines of total destruction are good for hunting enemy convoys and surface ships. We must have them immediately!"

TRM_Navy_Carrier: "Pacific Carriers"
TRM_Navy_Carrier_desc: "Naval carriers are considered by many to be the future of warfare on the high seas, particularly in the large Pacific Ocean. It would be wise to take advantage of our position and facilities to build these new ships."

TRM_Ind_Vlad: "Initial Industrialisation"
TRM_Ind_Vlad_desc: "Kolchak's autocratic government did almost nothing to develop our country at all during the 1920's. Now, we have a distinctly backwater industry, a situation which must be rectified soon. We should start to develop our country step by step. Even if our progress is slow, incremental improvements will result in a prosperous country some day."

TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv1: "Minor Japanese Investment"
TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv1_desc: "It may be a bitter pill, but we cannot develop without foreign investments. Japan is unfortunately the only country with the will and capability to invest in our economy, however this will inevitably upset our people."

TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv2: "Major Japanese Investment"
TRM_Ind_Jap_Inv2_desc: "We need more! Japan is willing to invest even more capital and industrial development in Transamur. There are concerns in our administration that our nation will become increasingly dependent on the Empire if we go down such a path. We must find a balance."

TRM_Ind_Dock: "Expand Vladivostok Dockyards"
TRM_Ind_Dock_desc: "Vladivostok is our only way to construct ships. We need even more dockyards if we want a proper fleet."

POLITICS_KAZEMBEK_DESC: "Little would have predicted that Alexander Kazembek would end up in the position he is in today. It seems as if his life may just be a lesson on the instability of the universe; of the chaos of politics and human existence. Born to a noble Iranian-Azerbaijani family, Kazembek saw the brunt of the Russian Revolution; something that undoubtably shaped his eccentric political views. However, instead of turning him against the Soviets, the Revolution endeared in him a certain level of respect for the Soviet System. And even though the Red Revolution failed; Kazembek still incorporated parts of the Soviet Ideals into his personal politics. \n\n His Charisma and experience as an Orator put him at the forefront of the new “Young Russia” group, a group that rejected Reactionary Tsarism in favour of a “New and Dynamic Vision”. As the situation in Russia deteriorated, Professor Nikolai Ustryalov convinced Party Secretary Kazembek to side with Alexander Kolchak and his coup against the Petrograd Government. Kolchak’s coup however failed; resulting in the creation of the state of Transamur; the rump state where Kazembek and Ustryalov fled to. These series of events led to Ustryalov and Kazembek rejecting the ideology of the Whites in favour of the Bolsheviks. This idealization lead to the development of the concept of a “Labour Monarchy”, and a system that combines Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". And as his Ideology grew and Changed, so did the influence of the Mladorossi within Transamur. Their influence grew and expanded, to a point where they could seize power following the Anti- Kolchak Coup. \n\n Now, Kazembek stands as the “Vozd” of the Rump State of Transamur. And though his influence may be currently small, Kazembek has plans to restore the Tsar, and soon reclaim all of Russia "

Strong-willed, ambitious, and determined to seize the throne, he has caused a headache to his first cousin, Nikolay II, several times. It is an open secret that during the February Revolution, Kirill actively worked against the Tsar and the rest of the House, even to the point where he ordered his men to raise the red flag above Petrograd - not because of any dedication to revolutionary ideals, but because of the hopes that he would become regent, or possibly even Tsar, after his cousin's abdication. \n\nAfter the execution of Nikolay and his family, Kirill claimed his rule over the scattered house of Romanov, a claim which was hotly contested by the rest of the family, who claimed that Kirill had no right to a restored Russian throne nor to lead the Russian royal family. By 1929, however, he was ultimately recognized, the untimely death of Grand Duke Nikolay certainly helped. While Kirill begrudgingly pays lip service to the Mladorossi, it truly doesn't matter to him who holds the keys to power; as long as he is in charge in some form. Even if Kirill is under practical House Arrest, and not but a powerless figurehead compared to Vozd Kazembek"
POLITICS_ALEXANDR_KOLCHAK_DESC: "Once a polar explorer and commander in the Imperial Russian Navy, who had also fought in both the Russo-Japanese War and the Weltkrieg, Kolchak is now the self-proclaimed "Supreme Ruler of Russia" in a puppet quasi-state in the Far East, unsuccessfully trying to throw off the shackles of Japanese imperialism. How did he come to such a life?\n\nWhen the civil war was raging in the vast expanses of Russia, Kolchak, in many ways suddenly for himself, was proclaimed the Supreme Ruler of Russia during the putsch in November 1918. Having first arrested the SRS and declared martial law, the imminent catastrophe was stopped by Boris Savinkov, who agreed with Kolchak on the adoption of the SR agrarian reform. The Whites were united and strong. The Siberian army soon merged with other white armies and by the end of 1919 the Bolsheviks surrendered. Having made a difficult choice in favor of Russia, Kolchak made an equally difficult choice, renouncing the supreme power and approving the Second Constituent Assembly in 1920.\n\nHowever, his relations with the newly created Russian Republic's government were quite hostile due to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which they had agreed to and signed, the Japanese Intervention in Transamur and Eastern Karelian Revolt. These relations only worsened in 1925 after Kolchak's unsuccessful coup d'etat against the government of Kerensky's "German lapdogs". The rogue admiral managed to escape from Russia and, ironically, found refuge in the pro-Japanese state of Transamur, the power in which belonged to the Kwantung army and the richest Merkulov family. Having enlisted the support of the ataman of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks Semenov and the East Siberian Oblastniks, as well as the support of Tokyo, Kolchak again found himself in the chair of the Supreme Ruler, but this time with a clear goal - to finish what he had started and overthrow the Petrograd regime."
POLITICS_SHUMYATSKY_DESC: "Boris Shumyatsky's parents were forced into exile in Siberia because they refused to leave their home. This incident has stuck with Shumyatsky, continually reminding him of the corruption within the Tsarist government based in Petrograd. A former Bolshevik, Shumyatsky was forced to leave Russia upon the conclusion of the Russian Civil War and has become an influential politician within Transamur. Despite his political views shifting towards the right, Shumyatsky continues to pursue the goal of turning Transamur into a welfare state. His past experience as a Bolshevik agitator has helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_MERKULOV_DESC: "A former leader of the pro-Japanese Provisional Transamur Government, Merkulov and his brother are the richest people in Transamur. Now, as Kolchak no longer stands in his way and democracy has finally returned to Vladivostok, Merkulov, a son of a humble peasant, is eager to lead Transamur to prosperity. His vast and personal connections with the people have helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_WOJ_DESC: "A leader of Czechoslovakian Legion and hero of the Russian Civil War, Wojciechowski has refused to accept the Brest-Litovsk treaty as legitimate. Outraged, he ceased all the contact with the government of the Russian Republic, and left for Transamur where he found many supporters. Formerly the right-hand man of admiral Kolchak, Sergei betrayed and killed his 'friend'. Less aggressive and ambitious than the rogue admiral, and a hardened veteran, Wojciechowski is now ready to advance West."
POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC: "An Ataman of the Baikal Cossacks, Semyonov and his boys had managed to establish a Transabaikal state, currently known as Transamur, in order to fight Bolsheviks who had been agitating in the Russian Far East. His newborn country was soon subjugated by Japan. When Kolchak's coup in 1925 had failed and the had rogue admiral had left Russia for Transamur, Semyonov was forced to resign and continue his career as military commander. However, the 'father-of-state' has managed to return, politically influential. Semyonov's only goal is to see Transamur prosper and, in order to do so, he is unwilling to wage uncertain wars."
POLITICS_YUI_DESC: "An old general, Mitsue is familiar with taking on command as he'd led the Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. A honourable war hero, he has been granted the ultimate gift from the emperor; to peacefully rule over the lands he'd conquered so many years ago. The old man is an isolationist and does not seek to wage any sort of war. With him assuming power as head of Transamur, the dream of a Greater Transamur has died."

TRM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1936, the Transamur Republic is a corporate and militaristic state, highly tied economically to the Japanese Empire. And yet Admiral Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"

tram.intro.t:0 "Transamur - Provisional Russian State in Vladivostok"
tram.intro.d:0 "Siberia and the Russian Far East had been a major area of conflict during the Russian Civil War, as the location of a short-lived democratic republic, the rising of the 'Czech Legion' and Japanese intervention. While forced to evacuate their forces due to German pressure (as well as intense resistance from local Cossacks), the Japanese remained eager to extend their influence and in 1922 pushed for the establishment of an independent state in the Transamur region. This motion gained the support of the Vladivostok business community, despite the fact that it left them vulnerable to forming an economic dependency on Japan. The majority of the business community however saw economic and diplomatic relations with the rising power in the East as a significant advantage, especially when compared to the alternative of being sucked further into the disorder besetting the rest of Russia. The new nation gained a prominent figurehead in the form of Admiral Kolchak, one of the most successful White Generals of the civil war and the one-time self-proclaimed 'Supreme Ruler of All Russia', who had been forced to flee Russia following his unsuccessful attempt to seize control in 1925.\n\nIn 1936, the Transamur Republic has become a corporate and militaristic state, highly tied economically to Japanese Empire. And yet Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"
tram.intro.a:0 "Interesting..."
tram.intro.b:0 "Tell me more about Transamur Politics"

tram.999.t:0 "The Oblastniki - Siberian Regionalists"
tram.999.d:0 "Siberian Regionalism is a political movement to form an autonomous Siberia. Firstly developed in the 19th century by Siberian students, it gained huge popularity during the Russian Civil War with the creation of the Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia. However, the Provisional Siberian Government sacrificed own independence for the sake of consolidation of all possible forces to fight with Bolsheviks.\n\nDuring the rule of Kerensky, though Russia was stated as a federative republic, President has continuosly blocked all resolutions about giving wider autonomy to Siberia and it is still an undeveloped region.\n\nWhile the majority of the Siberia is under control of the Petrograd Regime, most of the Oblastniks, both leftist and rightist have support their former ally - Admiral Kolchak in the putsch as he promised wide autonomy to Siberia and he even invited a prominent Oblastnik - Pyotr Vologodsky to become a prime-minister.\n\nIn 1936 they are still waiting for Kolchak to finally unite Russia under his rule and proclaim Siberian Autonomy. Their resistance increases with their popularity and if it is high enough they can even attempt to overthrow Kolchak."

tram.998.t:0 "The Japanese Business Interests in Transamur"
tram.998.d:0 "The Japanese Empire has a huge influence on our country - they were the ones that intervened in the Far-East during the Russian Civil War and expanded their influence in the Transamur Region. In 1922 an independent nation was formed in Vladivostok, supported by local business community. However, everything changed, when in 1925 Kolchak tried to coup the Russian government and was forced to flee to Transamur, supported by Oblastniki and Transbaikal Cossacks.\n\nFinding himself in a partially-recognized state with only ally, Kolchak has nothing to do but establish even stronger economic ties with the Japanese Empire. While formally Transamur is independent, Japanese has a free military access to our territory and provide us with supplies. Our dependence on Japan varies proportionally with the popularity of the Japanese Delegation. If their influence becomes too high, they will try to establish full control over our country."

tram.997.t:0 "Vladivostok Business Community"
tram.997.d:0 "The business circles of Vladivostok-namely, the Merkulov Brothers, and other, smaller businessmen, were the basis of Transamur when this state was first proclaimed. Although in 1925 they did not become part of the Kolchak Council of Ministers, in fact, all foreign trade is based on them. Under their control, together with the Kwantung Army, is the port of Vladivostok. This situation allows the Merkulovs to get rich, the Japanese garrison to receive corrupt bribes, and Kolchak can only silently watch the rampant crime. With each visit of the Japanese delegation, the business community is becoming more and more focused on trade with Japan. And it seems that this state of affairs will remain unchanged until Kolchak decides to finally break all ties with the Japanese Empire."

tram.996.t:0 "DO-ROVS - Siberian Monarchists"
tram.996.d:0 "General Diterikhs is a convinced monarchist, whose ideas are sometimes even too radical. Disappointed in the decision of the constituent assembly to establish a Republic and not return the tsar to the throne, Diterikhs soon joined Kolchak's putsch in 1925 and ended up in Transamur with him.\n\nHere he founded the so-called 'Far Eastern Branch of the Russian All-Military Union' and settled in Nikolayevsk, where a camp of his 'Crusaders' has been created. In addition, Diterikhs also established military control over the Trans-Siberian Railway near the Rukhlovo station, where the railway connects Primorye with Transbaikalia and Yakutia.\n\nDiterikhs is still more or less loyal to the Admiral, as he hopes that the Supreme Ruler will restore the Monarchy as soon as he takes Moscow. Nobody knows why Diterikhs is so sure of this, but Kolchak should be careful, because if the DO-ROVS is not loyal to the Supreme Ruler, anything can be expected from them."

tram.995.t:0 "Ataman Semyenov and the Cossacks"
tram.995.d:0 "Ataman Semyenov is an extraordinary person. Fluent in Buryat and Mongolian, Semyenov has surrounded himself with loyal people and has his own interests in the Far Eastern region. The ataman of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks, the marching ataman of the Amur and Ussuri Cossacks, Semyenov is the main representative of the interests of the Cossacks in Transamur. Despite the fact that he supported Admiral Kolchak both during the civil war and during the coup, his real intentions are unknown. According to rumors, his Cossack troops are supplied with Japanese weapons.\n\nAt the moment, Semyenov is actually waging a war with the remnants of Bolshevism - the partisans of the NRA, and despite the fact that he supports the oblasts and Buryat autonomists, he is engaged in power struggle with them for power in Transbaikalia. It is not known how loyal the Cossacks are to Kolchak, but the Supreme Ruler knows one thing for sure - you can expect anything from them."

tram.994.t:0 "NRA - The Last Stronghold of Bolshevism"
tram.994.d:0 "The Far Eastern People's Revolutionary Army is all that remains of the Red Army in the Far East, if these partisans can be called an army at all. General Blucher, their leader, is undoubtedly a coward. Having been defeated by the Siberian Army, he deserted and hid in the Siberian taiga. Surprisingly, somehow, the partisan movement in Transbaikalia was able to survive until our days. Perhaps the slave conditions of the workers in Chita and Khabarovsk contributed to this, but now the NRA are isolated partisans scattered across Transbaikalia, agitating for a return to Bolshevism. Leading an underground struggle and arranging sabotage, this movement must be destroyed."

tram.49.d:0 "[TRM.GetLeader] has decided to submit and kneel before us. Now, there is an empty office of the Vladivostok governorship, and so we shall find a replacement. There are several available options: Ataman Semyenov, leader of Transbaikal Cossack Host. A content Cossack ataman, he would be unlikely to cause serious problems. There is also the choice of the General Yui Mitsue who once was in command of Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. An old man deserving of a proper retirement, rule in Transamur would be a good fit for him. Still, several liberal ministers have been suggesting that we should establish a new democratic regime in Transamur instead."

Since many of them have bonds with us, they prefer to use the more or less stable Transamurian Ruble instead of the fluctuating Fengtian Tael, though its unclear if the transactions with our currency are legal or not.

After some time, the second Constituent Assembly was convened, and Kolchak resigned from his position as the Supreme Ruler of Russia.\n\nBut the next 5 years changed everything. First, the ongoing Japanese occupation of Transamur, in which local businesses seized power, effectively turning Vladivostok into a Japanese colony. Secondly, the German \"occupation\" of Russian industry, approved by Kerensky in the name of economic prosperity. Third, the rampant left-wing forces, famine in the Volga region, indulgences for the peasants, alienation of the property of the rich.\n\nAll this led to the event known as the Kolchak Putsch of 1925. And now the admiral has once again taken on the furrows of the Supreme Ruler, leading the Russian State in exile, waiting for the chance to return to Moscow and finally restore order in Russia."

With the loss of the Bolsheviks, the NRA continued its activities, but completely went underground, periodically arranging political assassinations and attempts on high-ranking officials. 15 years later, the NRA is still active... and either the lack of DO-ROVS agents, or the incompetence of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks, or the lack of infrastructure, prevents the exposure and destruction of this terrorist group.\n\nIn addition, the NRA also distributes outright Bolshevik propaganda, which tries to radicalize the workers of the large industrial cities of the Far East: Chita, Khabarovsk, etc. We must identify and destroy all the underground branches of the NRA, get their leadership and execute them before they plunge the Far East into the chaos of Bolshevism."

Everything changed in 1925, when the territory of Transamur radically increased, and in Vladivostok, in addition to them and the Japanese, the Siberian Army of Kolchak, the DO-ROVS, the Cossacks and the Siberian Regionalists appeared. Vladivostok, thus being the capital of Transamur, became a chessboard for all political groups of Transamur. And maybe Kolchak thinks that he is in charge here, but this is a mistake.\n\nAt the head of Vladivostok is the Japanese garrison of the Kwantung army, which guards the port of Vladivostok, and without its permission, no goods enter Vladivostok. But permission is very easy to get, especially if you belong to the Merkulov family - the richest entrepreneurs in the Far East. With a pocket Japanese garrison, the Merkulov brothers are trying not only to subdue the entire Vladivostok trade, but also politics with Spiridon Merkulov's National-Democratic Union being one of the largest allowed political parties in the Far-East."

trammlad.147.t:0 "The Union of Mladorossi"
trammlad.147.d:0 "The history of the "Young Russian" movement is inexorably tied to its leader, the charismatic aristocrat Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek, born in 1902 to a wealthy noble family of Azeri and Iranian origin. The three ideological phases of the Mladorossi can be closely mapped to Kazem-Bek's own life and experience; unsurprisingly considering his role as orator and ideologist. As a student activist, Kazem-Bek helped form the "Union of Young Russia" in 1923. Uniting 29 organisations and 4,000 people, the Young Russians represented the monarchist youth wing. Prone to intellectualism and ideologically vague, its members jointly rejected reactionary Tsarism in favour of a "new and dynamic vision". As secretary, Kazem-Bek met with Professor Nikolai Ustryalov, once head of the press bureau under Admiral Kolchak. Ustryalov convinced the young aristocrat to throw his support behind the putsch against President Kerensky in 1924. Both fled to Transamur following the coup's failure, taking their respective supporters along with them. Ustryalov became disillusioned with the White movement, and began idolising the Bolsheviks as defenders of Russian sovereignty.\n\nThe formation of the "Union of Young Russians" in 1925 marked the second ideological phase of the Mladorossi. Kazem-Bek began formulating his thesis of the "Labor Monarchy" under Ustryalov's tutelage. The nascent ideology of the Mladorossi combined an absolute monarchy, Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". During this period of 1925-1933, most Mladorossi were united only by theatrical oath-swearing ceremonies and readership of journals such as "Vivacity!" and "Towards Young Russia". The third phase occurred shortly after Kazem-Bek's travels to the Syndicalist nations of Europe. Kazem-Bek was particularly inspired by the proto-Totalism of the French & Italian national syndicalists, as well as the British Mosleyites. On his return, Kazem-Bek formed the "Mladoross Party" in 1934 as its "Vozhd".

Formed in 1931 by local politician and Kolchak loyalist, Anastasiy Vonsyatsky, the Natsionalisty have found support amongst Manchurian Russians and monarchist exiles. Young emigres still loyal to the ideals of a Russian Tsardom have flocked to this movement in awe of Vonsyatsky’s fiery speeches denouncing Bolshevism, Kerensky and Western Capitalism. All of which he accuses of degenerating the Russian people whilst declaring loyalty to Admiral Kolchak, the Russian Orthodox Church and a restored Tsardom. Espousing the homegrown ideology of “True Russian Nationalism”, the Natsionalisty have organised its members into a paramilitary force known as the, Black Vanguard, undoubtedly a reference to the Black Hundred.\n\n The Black Vanguard have provided security to Kolchak’s regime and have engaged in rounding up political dissidents as well as prominent members of the Jewish Vladivostok community accused of promoting ''dangerous foreign ideologies''. Admiral Kolchak has allowed for these actions to take place without officially endorsing the movements, perhaps to appease the Japanese authorities wary of an anti-foreign movement."

But, Kazem-Bek still holds out hope that a Romanov Claimant will approach us and let us crown him Tsar. However, one positive is that Kazem-Bek’s position has never been stronger, as there is no Tsar that reigns technically above him; even though the Tsar would hold little real power.

The night proved to be long and terrifying to those sheltering down in their homes, hoping fire would not be lit to them. At long last however, the crowds dispersed and the military appeared, initially thought to be restoring order, but they ended up proving to be a bitter end to the Japanese community that greeted them when they ordered them to mount trucks.

When Kolchak became a leader of Transamur, he promised a wide autonomy to Siberia as soon as it will be controlled by Kolchak's White Guard. The moment has come. Though Kolchak knows about his promises, the Oblastniki are the ones that support liberals and socialists - our main enemies. Oblastniki are becoming more and more pretentios and, therefore, dangerous to us."

We should establish a Siberian Regional Council that will be responsible for all civilian issues, though making our country more decentralized."

Nevertheless, our country won't succeed without the help of the DO-ROVS divisions."

TRM_Elite_Siberian_Squadron:0 "Elite Siberian Squadron"
TRM_Elite_Siberian_Squadron_desc:0 "The Siberian Army in its current state has much more advantages fighting a land war in Siberia that the divided and inefficient army forces of the Petrograd Regime.

Kolchak ensured the control of the Transsiberian Railroad in Amur Region with the help of the DO-ROVS, which made town of Rukhlovo a military base. Even though the governmental forces are controling the majority of Amur region, the NRA partisans are also active here, trying to gain control over the Rukhlovo for years without any success.§!"
TRM_Bodaybo_TITLE:0 "§LLocated in the Patom Highlands, Bodaybo was once known to be a perspective gold-mining region in Eastern Siberia, but in 1915 the area was cut off from the supply centers and as a result, gold production by 1921 decreased tenfold.\nWhile Kolchak's government tried to boost the gold industry in the region, it is still highly inefficient and the local civilian government takes about 80% of the gold to improve the area, providing the central authorities with almost no profit.§!"
TRM_Blagoveschensk_TITLE:0 "§LCity of Blagoveschensk, having the same name as the region, is a gradually developing and industrializing city, a large and important river port. It is known to once become the capital of the Amur Labour Socialist Republic during the Civil War and the socialist sentiments are still strong here.

Verkhneudinsk, bordering Irkutsk region of Russia is in a state of constant war preparations and increased border security, maintained by the joint forces of Kolchak and Cossacks. At the same time, the region has a local civilian government of Oblastniki and Buryats, who view Verkhneudinsk as their native and rightful home.\nMoreover, the region is filled with NRA partisans who try to provoke and sabotage either of the present political groups.§!"
TRM_Chita_TITLE:0 "§LChita is a large transport hub, which brings together a lot of Far-Eastern workers and, therefore, NRA partisans. What is more, local Chita Oblastniki are also a powerful force in the region, who are engaged in the power struggle with the local Master of Chita...\nThe region is under an undisputed control of Ataman Semyenov, who constantly terrorizes NRA and Oblastniki and builds a strong Cossack Host. Even though Kolchak needs Semyenov's support, he does not know about his real intentions and Japanese ties.§!"
TRM_Kamchatka_TITLE:0 "§LBeing the easternmost part of the Eurasian continent, Kamchatka is the 'godforsaken place'. Despite being such a notorious place, it still has some benefits, regarding fishery.

TRM_Kurily_TITLE:0 "§LThe Kuril Islands which were a part of the Japanese Empire since 1875, despite being an absolutely useless region at first glance, is strategically important for the Pacific Fleet.

TRM_Khabarovsk_TITLE:0 "§LThe Region of Khabarovsk was one of the main battlefields during the Civil War. Right now the Ussuri Cossack Host is located here, though its power is very limited due to the fact, that Khabarovsk is located in the so-called 'core Transamur'. The private sector and industry in the city is monopolized by Vladivostok Business Circles, which helps the NRA to bolster socialist sentiments in the region. Even though Khabarovsk is under military control of Kolchak's government, it also has the presence of the Japanese and Fengtian garrisons that ensure regular trading on concessional terms with Vladivostok Business Circle.§!"
TRM_Magadan_TITLE:0 "§LThe City of Okhotsk was once the main base the main base on the eastern borders of Russia for the flotilla and ships of the Russian-American Company and later became the cradle of the Pacific Fleet. However, the glorious times have passed and now Okhotsk is nothing more than another 'godforsaken place' in the middle of Siberian nowhere. Despite Okhotsk desolation, the Pacific Fleet is still there and is still loyal to the Supreme Ruler and Admiral, making it a cherry on the cake for the Japanese Empire.§!"
TRM_Nikolayevsk_TITLE:0 "§LDespite the fact that Nikolaevsk is a fairly small city located at the mouth of the Amur River, it is the center of gold mining in the entire Russian Far East and the second most important Far Eastern port.\nThough initially under the Japanese Intervention protection, right now the city of Nikolayevsk and the entire region is the main strongold of the DO-ROVS. Under firm hand of General Diterikhs, the region is becoming a new center of Russian Orthodoxy with radical Holy-Cross divisions being formed from citizens who are willing to fight in the Great Crusade Against... anything Diterikhs deems enough unspiritual§!"
TRM_Vladivostok_TITLE:0 "§LAh, Vladivostok, the Pacific gate of Russia!\nThe capital city of the Far East is perhaps the only place in the country where its fate is decided. With the Port of Vladivostok under occupation of the Japanese forces and Vladivostok Business Circle, the administrative buildings under 'occupation' of Kolchak Government, the military bases under control of the DO-ROVS, only streets and factories are left, where people are talking only about freedom and equality, inspired by the local Oblastniki and underground NRA resistance.§!"
TRM_Sakhalin_TITLE:0 "§LThe island of Sakhalin was under full Japanese occupation since 1920, making 'Karafuto' one of the bastions of the Japanese forces. The Sakhalin region is not only rich in fish, forest and coal, but also in something, very precious - Oil. As long as Sakhalin is ours, we can be sure that we have cheap fuel for the Pacific Fleet§!"
TRM_Yakutia_TITLE:0 "§LYakutia, the land of native Yakuts has a long and complex story of relations with Kolchak government. When in November 1918 Yakutia was captured by Kolchak's troops, the local Yakuts never received the autonomy they wanted and anti-Kolchak rebellion succeeded in December 1919. However, the Civil War soon came to an end, bringing back the civilian republican government, which still did nothing with desired Yakut Autonomy. Everything changed in 1925 when Oblastniki seized the initiative and joined the Far-Eastern Republic, establishing Yakut Autonomous Republic. Though Yakutia still stays anti-Kolchak, they will not tolerate his suzerainty over their territory.§!"

Only the most loyal and effective armed forces will be able to preseve us. Moreover, General Diterikhs insists on renaming the Siberian Army - Zemskaya Rat', meaning Zemstvo Host. In the framework of Diterikhs's policy of restoring the traditional way of life for Russia, the Zemskaya Rat army corps was organized into groups divided into regiments, formed from former brigades.

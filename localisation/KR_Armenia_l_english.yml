arm_ottoman_occupation:0 "Ottoman Military Government"
arm_ottoman_occupation_desc:0 "Ever since its occupation at the tail end of the Weltkrieg, Armenia has been buckled under the stress of the Ottoman army who even though the severe repression of the Weltkrieg has stopped, continue to be a daily presence in the life of the Armenian citizens. Besides the occupation, severe restrictions have also been imposed on its legislative assemblies and armament production barring the 'Vilayet of Armenia' from ever being a threat to the Turkish state."

### Focus tree ###
armenia_focus:0 "Armenian Focus Tree"

### Starting Tree ###

ARM_Black_Monday:0 "Attend the Samsun Economic Congress"
ARM_Black_Monday_desc:0 "The Empire is hosting an Economic Congress in Samsun in order to deal with the economic crisis, caused by the Black Monday. As Vilayet and integral part of the Porte, we should attend it."
ARM_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit:0 "Apply For Ziraat Bankasi Credit"
ARM_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_desc:0 "The Ziraat Bankasi, or Agricultural Bank, is operating with a state guarantee and we have no other choice but to ask it for a credit in order to revive our agricultural industry, affected by the crisis."
ARM_Armenian_Relief_Committee:0 "Ask ARC For Humanitarian Aid"
ARM_Armenian_Relief_Committee_desc:0 "The Armenian Relief Committee is an independent philantropic society, serving the humanitarian, social and educational needs of Armenians and non-Armenians alike, with its headquarters located in the United States. We can request Humanitarian aid from them in order to prevent famine in our Vilayet."
ARM_Assistance_For_Armenian_Farmers:0 "Assistance For Armenian Smallholders"
ARM_Assistance_For_Armenian_Farmers_desc:0 "It is clear that Armenian Smallholders are in dire need of relief. We should subsidize the farming sector as soon as possible."
ARM_Control_Wheat_Prices:0 "Control Wheat Prices"
ARM_Control_Wheat_Prices_desc:0 "With clear problems in agriculture, especially considering the failure of Ukrainian and German farming sectors, we cannot allow the market to depress our farmers even more. The Governor should put the wheat prices under control, before it is too late."

ARM_Wali_Karabekir:0 "Second Year of Vali Karabekir"
ARM_Wali_Karabekir_desc:0 "In 1935, Kazim Karabekir was appointed Governor of Erivan. As a relatively liberal governor primarily interested in the military with no real biases towards the Armenian nation, he allowed a slight political liberalization in the vilayet, giving the Armenian population the possibility to engage themselves in local politics.\nWith the upcoming second year in office, Karabekir is ready to continue with his liberalization policies."

ARM_Excersize_DF_Armenia:0 "Exercise DF Policies in Armenia"
ARM_Excersize_DF_Armenia_desc:0 "Being a leader of the DF (Democratic Party), Karabekir still had little chance to implement his policies in the Empire. Practicing liberalisation in Erivan during 1935 seems to be a success, and this year the Vali is ready to exercise even more liberal reforms."

ARM_Inspect_Garrison_Condition:0 "Inspect the Erivan Garrison"
ARM_Inspect_Garrison_Condition_desc:0 "The Erivan Garrison, stationed in the capital city of our Vilayet is under direct subordination of our Vali. We should inspect if everything in the garrison is well."


ARM_Expand_Local_Armenian_Government:0 "Expand Local Self-Government"
ARM_Expand_Local_Armenian_Government_desc:0 "Last year, the Vali allowed the Armenians in Yerevan gather in public associations and cooperate on city and even regional matters. This practice is likely to be expanded - with more and more voices in Erivan, mostly from the local population, promoting ideas of extended Armenian self-government."
ARM_Appease_Turkish_Elite:0 "Appease Turkish Elite"
ARM_Appease_Turkish_Elite_desc:0 "The Turkish Elite, settling down in Erivan and living their best lives, invested a lot into the development of the city. Despite some signs of arrogance and even neglect towards the local Armenian population, the rich are the main stronghold of Vali's power and should be appeased."
ARM_promote_the_public_school:0 "Promote Public Schools"
ARM_promote_the_public_school_desc:0 "While claimed by the OHF as their invention, public schools are seen by Vali as a good tool to both appease the local population and bring up the new generation of 'Ottomanized' Armenians. With a certain educational program in public schools, we should not worry about possible revolts in the future."
ARM_redistribute_the_lands:0 "Redistribute State Property"
ARM_redistribute_the_lands_desc:0 "Although the ideas of private land ownership were introduced into the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century and land redistribution was performed, large parts of the empire still remain either state or direct royal property. This absence of private land tenure decreases production, which brings despotism since there is no cause for people to work. As the liberals believe that humanity needs freedom to succeed, we must open these lands to private individuals."
ARM_Karabekir_foreign_investments:0 "Attracting Investors"
ARM_Karabekir_foreign_investments_desc:0 "Karabekir clearly understands that without foreign investments, the region is doomed. The province of Erivan should become a welcoming place for tourists and investors with its beautiful views and economic perspectives."
ARM_Encourage_Free_Market:0 "Encourage Private Initiative"
ARM_Encourage_Free_Market_desc:0 "Following the DF's political program, Karabekir is looking forward towards nurturing small business in the region, even the Armenian-owned one."
ARM_Increase_AGBU_Presence:0 "Increase AGBU Presence"
ARM_Increase_AGBU_Presence_desc:0 "The Armenian General Benevolent Union, established in 1906, preserves and promotes the Armenian identity and heritage through educational, cultural and humanitarian programs. The Weltkrieg, however, became a turning point both for the Armenian nation and the AGBU. A co-owner of Turkish Petroleum Company, a prominent oil magnate, Calouste Gulbenkian is the current leader of AGBU and he is very interested in expanding the philantropy in Erivan. This will not only require less attention from the Governor towards the problems of the local population, but also make Armenians more loyal to us."

ARM_Develop_Erivan:0 "Develop Erivan"
ARM_Develop_Erivan_desc:0 "Erivan is a multicultural city and we should invest more money into developing our capital city."

ARM_A_Model_Vilayet:0 "A Model Ottoman Vilayet"
ARM_A_Model_Vilayet_desc:0 "With a clear aim to become the standard of Vilayets in the Empire, [ROOT.GetLeader] has done much to achieve it. Our Vilayet should continue to develop."

ARM_A_Deal_With_Damadian:0 "A Deal With Damadian?"
ARM_A_Deal_With_Damadian_desc:0 "Mihran Damadian, leader of the banned ADL (Armenian Democratic Liberal Party), despite his Armenian nationalism stance, shares rather similar economic and political views to the Governor. While lifting the ban on ADL is not even discussed, a symbolic 'agreement' with the liberal Armenian educator can win us some sympathy among the common Armenians."
ARM_Contain_Armenian_Nationalism:0 "Contain Armenian Nationalism"
ARM_Contain_Armenian_Nationalism_desc:0 "Armenian Nationalism is a threat to our Vilayet. Despite economic prosperity, the people of Erivan still believe in their 'heroes', who will save them from 'evil Turks'. This radical movement should be watched and any our concession can be regarded as a weakness."
ARM_Strengthen_Repressions_Against_Dashnaks:0 "Strengthen Repressions Against Dashnaks"
ARM_Strengthen_Repressions_Against_Dashnaks_desc:0 "The Dashnaktsutyun (Armenian Revolutionary Federation) is the main source of instability in the region. Despite some of them sharing rather moderate and progressive views, the majority are radical terrorists, hiding in Mountains. 'Operation Nemesis' is still well remembered by Governor and we cannot allow it to be repeated."
ARM_Ostracize_Nzhdeh:0 "Hunt For Nzhdeh"
ARM_Ostracize_Nzhdeh_desc:0 "Garegin Nzhdeh, a terrorist and murderer, is a target number one in Armenia. Despite we don't know for sure where he hides, together with Azeri we should increase the bounty on this merciless tyrant."
ARM_Azeri_Deal:0 "Azeri-Erivan Anti-Terrorist Committee"
ARM_Azeri_Deal_desc:0 "We can no longer turn a blind eye to Armenian terrorism. We must join forces with Azerbaijan and eradicate this ungodly phenomenon in our territories."
ARM_ATO_Karabakh:0 "Launch Operation in Karabakh"
ARM_ATO_Karabakh_desc:0 "The last stronghold of Armenian ultranationalist forces, the Highland Karabakh region, should be infiltrated. All our enemies should finally face their timely and natural end."

ARM_Wali_Keresteciyan:0 "Vali Keresteciyan Appointed"
ARM_Wali_Keresteciyan_desc:0 "With Karabekir left, the new Erivan's governor is now Berc Keresteciyan, a Turkish Nationalist of Armenian Origin. Much more authoritarian and pro-Kemalist, than his predecessor, Keresteciyan's policies considering future of Erivan are yet unclear."
ARM_Kemalist_Erivan:0 "Dawn of Kemalist Erivan"
ARM_Kemalist_Erivan_desc:0 "The Era of liberal and tolerate Erivan is over. The sun of Centralism is rising over the Vilayet, and many may not like the light of its rays."
ARM_pursue_the_adoption_of_swiss_civil_code:0 "Pursue the Adoption of the Swiss Civil Code"
ARM_pursue_the_adoption_of_swiss_civil_code_desc:0 "The Swiss civil code was a possibility that the OHF government wanted to adopt because of its modern and secular character. It is the perfect opportunity to establish more equality in the Vilayet, especially regarding our Christian majority."
ARM_Import_Tarrifs:0 "Introduce Import Tariffs"
ARM_Import_Tarrifs_desc:0 "We cannot rely only on foreign investments. We should rely on ourselves instead - despite our size, there's much to develop in our Vilayet."


### Economic Tree
ARM_rebuild_erivan:0 "Rebuild the Capital"
ARM_rebuild_erivan_desc:0 "The heart of our nation, the city of Yerevan, has sadly not been spared by the destruction caused by our independence war. The people are in need of new homes, and our economy is in need of functioning industrial facilities. It is here that we should start our project of rebuilding the country."
ARM_help_the_people:0 "Mend the Scars"
ARM_help_the_people_desc:0 "The war did not just simply hurt our economy, it also hurt our people. Many have lost their loved ones, their homes, and their wealth. Some are even struggling to supply themselves and their families with food and are forced to live hand to mouth. We have to rebuild the hearts of our people before we can go on with our economic projects."
ARM_planning_economic_revival:0 "Reviving the Economy"
ARM_planning_economic_revival_desc:0 "The independence war has wrecked our economy. Throughout the country, countless buildings, especially industrial facilities, have been destroyed by the fighting. Many Armenians lost both home and workplace. In order to revive our economy, we'll have to think through every detail and plan the process of rebuilding step by step."
ARM_agricultural_development_scheme:0 "Agricultural Development Scheme"
ARM_agricultural_development_scheme_desc:0 "Agriculture is the backbone of both our society and economy. If it wasn't for our hard-working farmers, we would be forced to become dependant on imports from other countries or starve to death. Because of this, it only makes sense to start our economic revival by improving our agricultural production rates and supporting our farmers."
ARM_railway_expansion:0 "Expand our Railways"
ARM_railway_expansion_desc:0 "Railways truly are a magnificent invention. They are by far one of the fastest and safest means of transportation and have revolutionised our day-to-day life. We should work on expanding our railway network and connect some of the more remote cities to it in order to make it easier to travel across the country."
ARM_start_electrical_program:0 "Electrify the Country"
ARM_start_electrical_program_desc:0 "Light bulbs, telephones and radios - everything needs electricity nowadays. Making inventions like these available to the wider public would improve the standard of living in our country tremendously. Furthermore, electricity can also be used in factories to speed up production and produce higher quality goods."
ARM_train_purchase:0 "Acquire Foreign Trains"
ARM_train_purchase_desc:0 "Which use do our railways have if we can't put trains on them? Since we don't have the industrial capabilities to start producing trains inside of our country, we should try to purchase some from foreign producers. This will let us utilise our newly expanded railway system to the fullest extent."
ARM_the_dust_settles:0 "The Dust Settles"
ARM_the_dust_settles_desc:0 "Our nation was in ruins and threatened to collapse under its own weight. Still, we managed to hold on and revive not just our economy, but our country. Homes have been rebuilt, factories repaired and those in need supplied with food and shelter. The dust finally settles..."
ARM_armenian_broadcast:0 "The Armenian Radio"
ARM_armenian_broadcast_desc:0 "What better way is there to inform, amuse and influence our people than a national radio broadcast? An Armenian radio broadcast will make radios and electricity even more attractive to the people and allow us to better control the exact information they receive about political events and developments."
ARM_urbanisation_project:0 "Organise an Urbanisation Project"
ARM_urbanisation_project_desc:0 "Urbanisation is an ongoing development that cannot be stopped and should therefore be embraced. By controlling and planning the process of urbanisation, we can guarantee that we will make the most of the city growth it entails and utilise it to improve our economic situation."
ARM_begin_copper_mining:0 "Expand Copper Mining Operations"
ARM_begin_copper_mining_desc:0 "Our country is rich in mineral deposits, especially when it comes to copper, which is found in large amount in the mountains to the north of Yerevan. Since copper plays an important role in the modern world, mainly being used in electrical equipment, it would make sense to expand our mining operations. If we want to make some profit, we'll have to dig deep and dig greedily!"
ARM_erivan_university:0 "Expand the University of Yerevan"
ARM_erivan_university_desc:0 "The University of Yerevan, which was established in 1919, is by far the most modern and most important university of our country. An expansion of this institution would result in higher education being more easily accessible for the common people and would allow the university to offer a wider variety of different courses and degrees."
ARM_no_more_pandemy:0 "Vaccinate the People"
ARM_no_more_pandemy_desc:0 "Pandemics can tear entire countries and societies apart, wreck economies and take thousands of lives. This may not happen to the Armenian people! We shall organise a large-scale vaccination campaign and make sure that everyone is protected against most major diseases."
ARM_mobilise_the_economy:0 "Finance the Military"
ARM_mobilise_the_economy_desc:0 "Naturally, our nation can't survive without a proper military backing it. However, our military can only fulfil its purpose if it's financed and equipped properly. We should rebalance the budget and commit a greater amount of resources to the defence of our nation."
ARM_erivan_munition_factories:0 "The Factories of Yerevan"
ARM_erivan_munition_factories_desc:0 "Our army needs guns and other equipment in order to defend our country. We should improve the factories and arsenals of Yerevan so that we can better fulfil the needs of our soldiers. As a welcome side effect, this will also create some more jobs for those in need."
ARM_military_development:0 "Armenia's Arsenal"
ARM_military_development_desc:0 "Our men are ready to fight off every threat to Armenian independence. While their bravery is without comparison and their equipment somewhat sufficient, it certainly wouldn't hurt anyone if we were to increase the production rates of our military industry even more in order to create a stockpile large enough to last for the duration of an entire war."

### Army and Air Force
ARM_national_army:0 "The Armenian Army"
ARM_national_army_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies on virtually all sides. There is only one thing that can save us from our foes: the Armenian Armed Forces. Our proud soldiers shall defend our country and teach our enemies the meaning of fear! They shall not back down and fight till their bones turn to dust!"
ARM_mountain_corp:0 "Mountain Training"
ARM_mountain_corp_desc:0 "A good part of our nation is covered in mountains towering above the surrounding highlands. While this has some drawbacks, it also makes it more or less impossible to invade Armenia without suffering huge casualties. We should create a division specialised on fighting in this nigh impassable terrain so that the enemy thinks twice about climbing our mountains."
ARM_heal_our_men:0 "Hospitals for the Wounded"
ARM_heal_our_men_desc:0 "There is one resource that has become extremely rare in Armenia: manpower. To us, a single soldier is as valuable as a dozen battalions are to the Germans. We can't just simply leave the wounded to die on the fields. We have to take care of them, heal their wounds and get them back into shape. To that end, we should expand our hospitals and purchase better equipment for them."
ARM_veteran_knowledge:0 "Utilise the Knowledge of Veterans"
ARM_veteran_knowledge_desc:0 "While a large part of our army consists of fresh volunteers that signed up during our war of independence, there are also some among our ranks who have been a part of the Fidayi for decades. Their knowledge and experience could prove to be a vital advantage in the wars to come."
ARM_officer_school:0 "The Armenian Military School"
ARM_officer_school_desc:0 "An army is only as competent as its commanding officers. Our generals and field marshals have to be able to use certain strategies efficiently. To that end, we should establish a military school, where our officers will be taught modern strategies that can potentially save countless lives when used on the battlefield."
ARM_develop_our_artillery:0 "Develop our Artillery"
ARM_develop_our_artillery_desc:0 "One of the most efficient forms of support equipment is artillery. Throughout the years, this ranged weapon has constantly changed in terms of size, form and deadliness. Our artillery designs may not fall behind those of the other countries, lest our armies be overshadowed and outgunned by the enemies' soldiers."
ARM_a_necessary_force:0 "A Necessary Force"
ARM_a_necessary_force_desc:0 "Even though some may not like it, we need an army to secure our place in the world. And not just any army - we need soldiers that are ready to defend their homeland no matter the cost. We need men that can carry the weight of our entire nation on their shoulders. And above anything else, we need a military that the people can put their trust in."
ARM_airforce:0 "The Armenian Air Force"
ARM_airforce_desc:0 "Modern wars are no longer solely decided by the men fighting on the land and on the seas, they can also be won up in the skies. A modern and efficient Air Force can harass hostile troops, cut of supply lines and even bomb the enemy into submission. However, an Air Force can also be very costly, and it takes both time and effort to construct one from scratch. The sooner we start drawing up plans, the better."
ARM_radar_station:0 "Construct Radar Stations"
ARM_radar_station_desc:0 "Radar stations as an invention are often underrated. While not directly contributing to the combat, they can decide the outcome of a battle by providing us with valuable information. For example, they can detect enemy airplanes long before we could spot them with ordinary measures. Furthermore, they also make it easier to evaluate the current weather situation, which makes planning operation less of a headache for our generals."
ARM_rebuild_the_erivan_airport:0 "Open the Yerevan Airport"
ARM_rebuild_the_erivan_airport_desc:0 "The newly established Armenian Air Force needs a central base to operate from. By opening an airport in our capital city of Yerevan, we can kill two birds with one stone: Our Air Force could use this airport as a headquarter for its operations and our government could use it to increase our import and export rates by opening it up to cargo planes."
ARM_little_airship_specialisation:0 "Specialise on Smaller Aircraft"
ARM_little_airship_specialisation_desc:0 "Just like our country itself, our industrial capabilities are quite small. Since we cannot afford to build resource-draining plane types such as heavy bombers or heavy fighters, we are more or less forced to specialise on smaller planes. However, we should not judge them by their size, since light fighters, reconnaissance planes, and the like can be just as valuable as larger aircraft if used correctly."
ARM_airplane_workshop:0 "Building an Air Force"
ARM_airplane_workshop_desc:0 "Obviously, an airport is not enough. The Armenian Air Force also needs planes in order to be able to conduct operations. The construction of workshops and factories specialised on producing and repairing airplanes fit for our military will guarantee that our pilots never run out of high quality aircraft."
ARM_fortress_without_sky:0 "Defend the Armenian Skies"
ARM_fortress_without_sky_desc:0 "Until now, we have focussed most of our defensive efforts on ground warfare and have mostly been building fortifications designed to counter infantry, artillery, tanks and suchlike. However, we also have to watch the skies and defend our cities from aerial bombardments, a goal which will require the use of stationary anti-air guns."
ARM_aerial_reconnaissance:0 "Eyes in the Sky"
ARM_aerial_reconnaissance_desc:0 "One of the most significant advantages of modern aircraft is that it can be used to spy on enemies from a safe distance. Reconnaissance planes, for example, are capable of gathering vital information without getting into firing range of the enemy on the ground. As Sun Tzu once said:0 "He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight." - and with our eyes up in the sky, we will always now when to fight."

### Independence War
ARM_War_of_Liberation:0 "The War of Liberation"
ARM_War_of_Liberation_desc:0 "After living under foreign rule and oppression for centuries, the people of Armenia finally said:0 "Enough!". The decline of the Ottoman Empire and now the outbreak of the Desert War have rekindled the hopes for an independent Armenian state. However, if this dream of freedom and liberty is to be realised, we have to rise up and fight! For our families! For our future! For Armenia!"
ARM_reinforce_erevan:0 "Fortify Yerevan"
ARM_reinforce_erevan_desc:0 "If we want to win this war, we'll have to fortify our mountains and defend them whatever the cost may be. Building fortifications around our capital city of Yerevan will surely make this task much easier and save the lives of many young men."
ARM_centralising_the_movement:0 "Centralise the Movement"
ARM_centralising_the_movement_desc:0 "We cannot hope to win the war if every Armenian fights for himself. We can only win by fighting as one, united and centralised. In order to achieve this, the Armenian people will have to rally behind a central leader - and there's only one person suitable for this position: Nzhdeh."
ARM_propaganda_campaign:0 "Organise a Propaganda Campaign"
ARM_propaganda_campaign_desc:0 "Some parts of the population still have a rather sceptical attitude towards Nzhdeh and his government, fearing that they only act in their own interests, not those of the Armenian people. Launching a large-scale propaganda campaign could help remedy this issue whilst also raising support for our war effort."
ARM_a_fight_until_the_end:0 "Fight until the End!"
ARM_a_fight_until_the_end_desc:0 "Never again shall the Armenian people be subjugated by foreign invaders! We have been oppressed for far too long and will never again experience such agony! If we cannot achieve the Armenian dream, at least we can give our live for the country of our fathers!"
ARM_organise_Dashnak_veterans:0 "Organise Dashnak Veterans"
ARM_organise_Dashnak_veterans_desc:0 "The Dashnaks have fought in the name of the Armenian people for many years now. Even though this fight may not have been an open war but rather took the form of a resistance movement that launched a few small insurrections, the experience the Dashnaks have gathered throughout these years molded them into great fighters that can withstand even the most superior forces."
ARM_unite_the_fedayis:0 "Unite the Fidayi"
ARM_unite_the_fedayis_desc:0 "The term Fidayi describes Armenian civilians who left their homes and families in order to protect Armenia from the barbaric and bloodthirsty Turks. Now that Armenia has become a real nation, we have to unite these Irregulars into organised troops in order to lay the foundations of a modern and professional army that can defend our beloved country."
ARM_integrate_the_militias:0 "Integrate the Militias"
ARM_integrate_the_militias_desc:0 "Now that the Armenian army has been officially established, we can begin to integrate the militia troops scattered throughout our country into a wider and better organised command structure. This will also allow us to use modern strategies on the battlefield, which will improve our chances of withstanding a potential invasion immensely."
ARM_professionalize_the_army:0 "A Professional Army"
ARM_professionalize_the_army_desc:0 "The core of every modern army is professionalism. Without discipline and proper training our soldiers will drop like flies and leave Armenia wide open to the enemy's forces. Let's bring our training methods up to today's standards and create an army that our people can be proud of!"
ARM_the_savior_of_armenia:0 "The Saviour of Armenia"
ARM_the_savior_of_armenia_desc:0 "In Armenia's hour of need, one man stood up to save the nation from its approaching enemies. One man decided to ignite a flame that neither the Turks nor the Russians or anyone else can extinguish. This man was none other than the heroic Nzhdeh, saviour of our nation."
ARM_create_local_fedayis_units:0 "Keep the Fidayi Decentralised"
ARM_create_local_fedayis_units_desc:0 "Throughout the last few decades, the Fidayi, irregular units composed of Armenian volunteers, kept our nation and our people save from the Turkish oppressors. Without their protection, the Armenian people probably wouldn't exist anymore. So why should we change something about the way they operate? Haven't they proven their efficiency already?"
ARM_use_guerilla_tactics:0 "Use Guerrilla Tactics"
ARM_use_guerilla_tactics_desc:0 "When fighting against a clearly superior foe, guerrilla warfare is by far the most efficient strategy to use. By ambushing our enemies where they would least expect it and by cutting off their supply lines, we can cause high casualties while suffering barely any ourselves. This will make the other nations think twice before attacking us!"
ARM_call_for_people:0 "A Call to Arms"
ARM_call_for_people_desc:0 "It is the duty of every Armenian man to protect his country in its time of need. Every additional man on the front lines could potentially tip the scales and turn the tide of the war. If we all work together to achieve our common goal of an independent Armenian state, we cannot fail and cannot be broken!"
ARM_create_people_militia:0 "Mobilise the People"
ARM_create_people_militia_desc:0 "Many men have heeded [ARM.GetLeader]'s call to arms and are just waiting to be equipped and deployed on the front lines. We should organise these new recruits into small militia groups that can act independently from each other and thus react quickly and decisively on enemy movements."
ARM_coordinate_with_teheran:0 "Coordinate with Teheran"
ARM_coordinate_with_teheran_desc:0 "We are not alone in our fight against the Ottomans. Indeed, nations from all across the Middle East have come together to finally rid the world of this rotten Empire. [PER.GetNameDefCap] is one of them. Even though there may be some discrepancies between us and the [PER.GetAdjective]s, it would be a wise move to coordinate our operations with them in order to defeat the Turkish beast."

### Political Trees
ARM_free_once_again:0 "Freedom at Last"
ARM_free_once_again_desc:0 "What has long been deemed impossible has finally come true. At last, our people have been freed from foreign rule and oppression, and the Armenian nation stands victorious over the Ottoman Empire. Though there is still much more to be done, today we celebrate our victory and mourn those we have lost."

### Tseghakronutyun Tree
ARM_armenia_above_all:0 "Armenia above All"
ARM_armenia_above_all_desc:0 "There is only one nation we truly have to care about: Armenia. Our people have proven their greatness time and time again throughout history, yet they are barely recognised for their bravery by other countries. Soon, they shall learn to respect us!"
ARM_promote_identity:0 "Promote a National Identity"
ARM_promote_identity_desc:0 "Large parts of our population speak the same language, share the same values and live by similar traditions, giving our people a sense of unity and cohesion. In accordance with the Tseghakronist cause, it is our duty to formalise this national identity and to promote it through any means necessary."
ARM_armenian_ideal:0 "The Armenian Ideal"
ARM_armenian_ideal_desc:0 "A good Armenian should be diligent, brave, deeply religious and, above all, obedient. If we want our people to embrace these traits, we'll have to promote them vigorously. Schools shall amend their curicula to teach our children the value of these qualities and posters promoting these ideals shall decorate the streets of our cities."
ARM_first_christian_nation:0 "The First Christian Nation"
ARM_first_christian_nation_desc:0 "Religion is one of the pillars of Tseghakronism. The trust our people put in the Armenian Apostolic Church is what held them together while our nation was under foreign occupation, and, with Armenia having been the first nation to officially adopt Christianity, religion has always been an important part of Armenian culture. Let us show the world what true Christians look like!"
ARM_personality_cult:0 "Nzhdeh's Cult of Personality"
ARM_personality_cult_desc:0 "Without Nzhdeh, Tseghakronism wouldn't exist. He was the one that led our nation through the dark and into the light. The entire country of Armenia owes him its freedom and liberty. It is about time that we make his status as a national hero official. Henceforth, all shall applaud the Armenian Eagle!"
ARM_superiority_eternity:0 "Eternal Superiority"
ARM_superiority_eternity_desc:0 "The Armenian people can truly be proud of themselves. All on their own, they have created an eternal state, one that can withstand the sands of time itself. Others may try to take away what we have achieved, but they will all fail and be forced accept that Armenia is here to stay!"

### Survival Party Tree
ARM_safeguard_our_independence:0 "Safeguard our Independence"
ARM_safeguard_our_independence_desc:0 "The utmost goal of the Survival Party has always been to secure the independence of Armenia. We will have to begin building fortifications, conscripting young men and preparing our soldiers for the inevitable. No enemy shall ever set foot on Armenian soil!"
ARM_military_government:0 "Words Backed by Firepower"
ARM_military_government_desc:0 "Our government is, naturally, heavily influenced by the military part of the coalition. While some radical republicans like to highlight the disadvantages of this, it also has many benefits. For example, our regime is less vulnerable to coup attempts, since the military can hardly coup itself. We should try to convince the wider public of the fact that a military government isn't as bad as it may seem on first glance."
ARM_mountainous_stronghold:0 "Fortress Armenia"
ARM_mountainous_stronghold_desc:0 "While the mountains of our nation give us a natural line of defence, they are not enough. We can't completely rely on nature to keep our enemies at bay. We are in need of strong fortifications, capable of withstanding enemy fire and bombardments, which will keep the Armenian people safe and secure."
ARM_integrate_military_in_the_government:0 "Integrate the Military into the Government"
ARM_integrate_military_in_the_government_desc:0 "Our military has become a natural part of our government. No longer shall these two institutions stay separated, it is time to unify them. This will allow the army to influence our politics even more, but also make it easier for the Dashnak part of the coalition to control this influence."
ARM_dashnak_support:0 "Secure Dashnak Support"
ARM_dashnak_support_desc:0 "While a large part of the Dashnaktsutyun support the Survival Party, there are still some members wishing for a change in government and the establishment of a true republic. We should show these people our good will and convince them that we are the only force strong enough to guarantee the independence of the Armenian state."
ARM_revolutionary_idea:0 "The Revolutionary Idea"
ARM_revolutionary_idea_desc:0 "While not fully being in favour of a Syndicalist system, the Dashnaks always wished for a moderate revolution in the economy. With their new position in the government, they can finally implement the changes they've dreamed of for years and show the workers of our country that no complete upheaval of the political system is needed in order to achieve a better life."
ARM_a_new_social_system:0 "A New Social System"
ARM_a_new_social_system_desc:0 "The Dashnaks not only want a moderate revolution in the economy, they also want to tackle our social system. From now on, equality and solidarity shall play a bigger part in the day-to-day life of the Armenian people. While not completely getting rid of the capitalist system, the Dashnaks also seek to reduce the importance of personal wealth in our society."
ARM_protect_the_revolution:0 "Protecting the Revolution"
ARM_protect_the_revolution_desc:0 "We have achieved a society that doesn't solely rely on capitalist or revolutionary doctrines. We have found a third way, one that unifies the advantages of both systems and compensates their flaws. We have to protect what we have accomplished, lest our society should take a step back into the last century."
ARM_a_fight_for_our_survival:0 "Fight for our Freedom"
ARM_a_fight_for_our_survival_desc:0 "We Armenians have always been brave people and have never feared a good fight. With our precious freedom being regained, we have a cause we can fight for more fiercely than ever before. History shall remember the stout-hearted Armenian soldiers fighting in the name of liberty against the tyrants of their time!"

### Boghos Bey Tree
ARM_collaborate_with_turkey:0 "Reconcile with our Former Enemies"
ARM_collaborate_with_turkey_desc:0 "Our people share a long history with the Turks, and many reserve a special kind of hatred towards them. However, if our nation is to survive, we need cordial relations especially with our more ambitious neighbours, and since the Turks have also experienced a change in government in the near past, they might be a good start."
ARM_armenian_nationalism:0 "Bolster Armenian Nationalism"
ARM_armenian_nationalism_desc:0 "Our people can and should be proud to be born Armenian. They share a rich history, a beautiful language and a common national identity. It is our duty to emphasise the importance and greatness of Armenian culture. After all, it is what sets us apart from the other nations and what defines both our country and our future."
ARM_a_benevolent_people:0 "A Benevolent People"
ARM_a_benevolent_people_desc:0 "Kindness, pride, humility, courage, benevolence and diligence - these are just some of the traits often associated with the average Armenian. We should show the world the good will and the overall greatness of the Armenian people by living in unity and harmony."
ARM_promote_heroism:0 "Promote Heroism"
ARM_promote_heroism_desc:0 "If it were not for the heroes of our independence war, we would still be subject to the vile Turks. If it were not for the heroes of democracy, Nzhdeh would have brought our nation death and destruction without opposition. Time and time again, our people have been saved by the heroes of the day, and now, it is time to encourage the heroes of tomorrow!"
ARM_arrest_criminals:0 "Crack Down on Criminals"
ARM_arrest_criminals_desc:0 "The social disorder and general chaos caused by the sudden outbreak of our independence war made it nigh impossible for our government to focus on hunting down lawbreakers, meaning that more often than not criminals, especially petty ones, would stay unprosecuted. This resulted in a wave of crime across our country - an issue that has to be tackled, if necessary even with the help of the military."
ARM_reform_the_military:0 "Reform the Military"
ARM_reform_the_military_desc:0 "Although our military might have been competent enough to win our independence war, this was only the case because the Ottomans were severely weakened and fighting a war on multiple different fronts. If we want to be able to stand on our own two feet and win a war without any foreign help, we will have to reform our military and increase its capabilities."
ARM_end_the_state_of_emergency:0 "End the State of Emergency"
ARM_end_the_state_of_emergency_desc:0 "The state of emergency was declared to allow Bey and his followers to secure their new position as the government of the Armenian people. As it seems that there are no longer any threats to Bey's righteous rule, the end of the state of emergency should be proclaimed and other democratic parties reallowed."
ARM_call_for_democrats:0 "Liberalise the Nation"
ARM_call_for_democrats_desc:0 "It was always Bey's goal to liberalise and democratise the nation. Now that the state of emergency has been lifted, he can finally start to work on achieving this goal. The first step towards a more democratic and liberal nation is, in his eyes, the opening of public schools and the encouragement of foreign investments."
ARM_social_reforms:0 "Enact Social Reforms"
ARM_social_reforms_desc:0 "When it comes to our social system, our country is still severely lacking in multiple aspects. If we want to increase the standard of living across the nation, we'll have to carry out some major reforms. For example, we should guarantee the freedom of religion, make healthcare more affordable and simplify the administration."
ARM_foreign_investments:0 "Attract Foreign Investments"
ARM_foreign_investments_desc:0 "A steady influx of foreign capital is needed in order to prevent our economy from stagnating. Subsequently, the Ramgavar have now brought forward a proposal aimed at making investments in our industry more lucrative and attractive to foreign entrepreneurs by introducing tax cuts and diversifying our exports."

### Hunchak/Communists Tree
ARM_first_popular_assembly:0 "The First Popular Assembly"
ARM_first_popular_assembly_desc:0 "With the revolution being achieved, it is now the time to decide the future course of the country. Two main factions have formed: the Communists and the Hunchaks, both aiming to carry the torch of the revolution. We shall organise the First Popular Assembly, which shall decide who should lead our people into their glorious and prosperous future."
ARM_hunchak_victory:0 "Victory of the Hunchaks"
ARM_hunchak_victory_desc:0 "The Popular Assembly has concluded - and chosen the Hunchaks to carry on the revolution! The Hunchaks promised the implementation of social reforms, the expansion of workers' rights and the protection of the revolution no matter the cost. With them guiding the way, our nation shall become a beacon of socialism!"
ARM_labor_rights:0 "Codify Labour Rights"
ARM_labor_rights_desc:0 "We cannot accept that some of our countrymen have to live in poverty while working full-time. Even though the workers are the backbone of our country, they are being treated worse than slaves. From now on, child labour will be officially forbidden, a minimum wage specified and a maximum number of work hours in a week established."
ARM_socialists_reforms:0 "Introduce Socialist Reforms"
ARM_socialists_reforms_desc:0 "When it comes to our social system, our country is still severely lacking in multiple aspects. If we want to increase the standard of living across the nation, we'll have to carry out some major reforms. For example, we should guarantee the freedom of religion, make healthcare more affordable and simplify the administration."
ARM_revolutionary_army:0 "A Revolutionary Army"
ARM_revolutionary_army_desc:0 "Our main goal of protecting the revolution can only be achieved with the help of a well-trained and adequately equipped military. We shall reorganise our forces into the Armenian Revolutionary Army, implement new training methods and make the chain of command easier to follow and more efficient."
ARM_communist_victory:0 "Victory of the Communists"
ARM_communist_victory_desc:0 "The Popular Assembly has concluded - and chosen the Communists to carry on the revolution! This more radical faction has promised to completely reform the economy with an emphasis on a Marxist base and to take action against social inequality. Let's hope that they can achieve their goals and turn our state into the paradise Marx dreamed of!"
ARM_collectivisation:0 "Begin the Process of Collectivisation"
ARM_collectivisation_desc:0 "How can we call ourselves a nation of equals when there are still some using their property for their own gains and not for the good of society? We have to clamp down on these selfish people by collectivising major factories and landholdings and directly integrating them into the state economy. After all, even though they may not believe us, it is only for their own good!"
ARM_nationalisation:0 "Nationalise the Economy"
ARM_nationalisation_desc:0 "There is still a number of companies in our country trying to exploit the market for their own profit - disgusting and unacceptable behaviour! By nationalising these enterprises, we can guarantee that they only think about what is best for our country and our society while also controlling the implementation of workers' rights."
ARM_marxist_guidance:0 "Marxist Guidance"
ARM_marxist_guidance_desc:0 "As Marx once said 'The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism.' Through our reforms we have managed to achieve proper peace. Workers throughout the country live under proper conditions and know that their work contributes to the wealth and prosperity of our society. The principles of Marx have not only become a part of the Armenian life, they have also become a part of the Armenian heart."
ARM_help_from_our_western_brothers:0 "Our Western Brethren"
ARM_help_from_our_western_brothers_desc:0 "We are not alone in this world. To the west there are countries that had their regimes toppled in the wake of a Syndicalist revolution and are now looking to support like-minded governments all across the globe. Seeing how similar our ideologies are, they'll surely see us as a friend and grant us any support we need."
ARM_help_from_our_northern_brothers:0 "Our Northern Brethren"
ARM_help_from_our_northern_brothers_desc:0 "We are not alone in this world. Russia is finally free from bourgeouis nationalism and can be our vital ally in the North."
ARM_revolutionary_vanguard:0 "Vanguard of the Revolution"
ARM_revolutionary_vanguard_desc:0 "Technological advancements can make the difference between a failed state and a rising power. If our revolution is to survive these difficult times, we'll have to support the great minds of our country and grant them all the financial help they need for their research. They shall be the vanguard of our revolution!"
ARM_export_the_revolution:0 "Exporting the Revolution"
ARM_export_the_revolution_desc:0 "While our people live in heaven on earth, there are others in other parts of the world still suffering from their oppressive regimes. We aren't any better than those exploiting and suppressing these people if we just stand by idly doing nothing. We have to free those in need of our help from their chains! This revolution shall be a global one!"
ARM_revolutionary_ideal:0 "The Revolutionary Ideal"
ARM_revolutionary_ideal_desc:0 "We have achieved the ideal revolution. Without a need for bloodshed, we were able to completely change our society. Our people can live happy and untroubled lives without a capitalist upper class exploiting them for their own gain. We have become an example for nations from all around the world to follow."

ARM_open_the_south_front:0 "Open the South Front"
ARM_open_the_south_front_desc:0 "The Don-Kuban mess in the North is our main obstacle on the way to world revolution."

ARM_soviet_union:0 "Establish the Soviet Union"
ARM_soviet_union_desc:0 "Our ambitions lie much further than the Caucasus. We shall reclaim all of Russia and lead the Bolshevist Revolution!"

### Armenian Republican Tree
ARM_first_armenian_elections:0 "The First Armenian Elections"
ARM_first_armenian_elections_desc:0 "Although Nzhdeh may have helped our nation survive our independence war, his political views are less than ideal and not fit for the ruler of our people. We need a democratic system, be it a revolutionary or a moderate one. It is time to hold the first Armenian elections! The people shall decide who should guide them into a better future!"
ARM_caucasus_deam:0 "The Caucasian Dream"
ARM_caucasus_deam_desc:0 "It was always the dream of the various Caucasian ethnicities to achieve freedom and liberty for their people. After centuries of struggle, the Armenian people finally managed to attain theirs and to establish an independent Armenian state. Now, it is time to defend what we have gained. The Caucasian dream shall not be crushed!"
ARM_protect_national_integrity:0 "Maintain the National Integrity"
ARM_protect_national_integrity_desc:0 "The Armenians are not alone in their struggles - they have each other. They can trust their fellow countrymen and their government. They know that every Armenian will stand up for them should they ever be threatened, and they know that their government does everything in its power to protect their rights and to provide them with the basis for a prosperous life."
ARM_reconciliation:0 "Political Reconciliation"
ARM_reconciliation_desc:0 "There are some parts of the opposition that don't view us as political allies trying to protect our precious democracy, but rather as enemies taking away their chance to rule the nation. However, it is important for the different democratic factions to hold together and radiate unity. We should try to reconcile with some of the parties sceptical of our political course."
ARM_individual_innovation:0 "Individual Innovation"
ARM_individual_innovation_desc:0 "One of the most notable advantages of liberalism is the concept of individual innovation. Because every person has to think for themselves, people will come up with new and sometimes ingenious ways to deal with common problems, allowing our society to become more efficient and productive overall."
ARM_ramgavars_victory:0 "Victory of the Ramgavar"
ARM_ramgavars_victory_desc:0 "The people have voted and the results are coming in! The Ramgavar, a party advocating liberalism and capitalism, has managed to secure a landslide victory. Under the protecting hand of this party, Armenia shall enter an age of individualisation and economic growth!"
ARM_neoclassic_economy:0 "A Neoclassic Economy"
ARM_neoclassic_economy_desc:0 "The neoclassic economic theory states that supply and demand can be brought in accordance with one another by letting the free market adjust the prices. Both consumers and producers try to defend their interests, leading to compromises which guarantee that the needs of both sides are satisfied."
ARM_grant_property_right:0 "Protect Property Rights"
ARM_grant_property_right_desc:0 "Every individual should have the right to use, sell, and alter their own economic goods according to their own liking. If we want to create a truly free and liberal state, we'll have to make sure that these property rights are protected, lest savage processes like nationalisation and collectivisation strip away the freedom of the individual."
ARM_promote_the_individual:0 "Individualise our Society"
ARM_promote_the_individual_desc:0 "While a certain feeling of cohesiveness and solidarity is needed for a state to function, we shouldn't let the development of the individual be restricted by a blooming group identity. Every person has the right to find their own way in life, to develop their own personality and to achieve their own personal freedom."
ARM_christian_values:0 "Promote Christian Values"
ARM_christian_values_desc:0 "Every person should have the right to shape their own life and to make decisions however they please. However, this has to be done in accordance with a moral codex if a peaceful coexistence shall be possible in our society. This moral codex can be found in the form of Christian virtues and teachings, that have already influenced the way our ancestors behaved centuries ago."
ARM_moderate_dashnak:0 "Victory of the Dashnaks"
ARM_moderate_dashnak_desc:0 "The people have voted and the results are coming in! Hoping for changes to the social system, the majority of our citizens decided to vote for the Dashnaks, a social democratic party promising to socialise the nation and to turn the day-to-day life of the average Armenian into something worth living for."
ARM_popular_democracy:0 "Popular Democracy"
ARM_popular_democracy_desc:0 "The entire point of democracies is to apply the will of the people to the nation's politics. This goal is best achieved by establishing a popular democracy, a more direct form of democracy based on popular referendums. This form of government will allow us to include every Armenian in the decision-making of the government."
ARM_minimum_wage:0 "A Fair Minimum Wage"
ARM_minimum_wage_desc:0 "The workers are the lifeblood of every society. Sadly, they are quite often also treated as dispensable resources and given only breadline wages. In a country in which the people are supposed to live freely and happily, this is unacceptable! A fair minimum wage will solve this problem and guarantee that every Armenian lives above the poverty line."
ARM_marxist_approach:0 "Reconsider Marxist Ideas"
ARM_marxist_approach_desc:0 "Even though we may not be a fully socialist country, there is still much to learn from Marx and his writings. Overall, his ideas weren't all that bad and could probably contribute to the wealth of our society if we manage to combine them with the modern capitalist economic system."
ARM_social_economy:0 "Socialise our Economy"
ARM_social_economy_desc:0 "The production of goods shall no longer be a private endeavour, but rather a collective one. Multiple people working together to achieve a common goal will always have a higher rate of success than the lonely individual. Furthermore, it will also boost the morale of our workers, since working in a group always sparks joy."
ARM_democracy_in_orient:0 "The Beacon of Oriental Democracy"
ARM_democracy_in_orient_desc:0 "Democracy as a concept hasn't really caught on in the Orient. While many of our neighbouring countries still applaud their monarchies and military regimes, we have managed to establish a stable and almost flawless democracy. We have become a shining beacon in the otherwise dark Orient, a guiding light for countries near and far!"
ARM_look_for_protection:0 "Look for Protection"
ARM_look_for_protection_desc:0 "Most of our neighbouring countries would probably not hesitate to annex our young state if given the chance. With our nation being relatively small compared to the other nations around us, we can't hope to resist them all on our own. We should try to get another country to support our independence in order to scare our more savage neighbours away."


### Armenian Foreign Policy ###

ARM_expansionism:0 "Armenian Expansionism"
ARM_expansionism_desc:0 "If our nation is to prosper and flourish, we need to expand our borders, and if we have to invade other countries for that to happen, then so be it. Soon, we shall reign supreme in the Caucasus and beyond - and our people are going to reap the benefits of these conquests."
ARM_revenge_against_turks:0 "Retaliation against the Turks"
ARM_revenge_against_turks_desc:0 "Our history with the Turks is...difficult, to say the least. They enslaved our people for centuries and oppressed any form of resistance against their tyrannical regime. While we couldn't do anything about this for a very long time, the Turks have just taken a heavy beating and are now far weaker than ever before. It is time for our revenge..."
ARM_Retake_Karabakh:0 "Reclaim the Artsakh"
ARM_Retake_Karabakh_desc:0 "The region of Karabakh has historically been tied to our nation as a part of the Artsakh province, but was wrongfully taken from us during the Caucasus Conference of 1919. Back then, we were in no position to fight this dictated peace and were forced to become subjects to the Sublime Porte. Now that we have regained our freedom from the Turks, however, we can finally take back what is rightfully ours."

ARM_Transcaucasian_Diplomacy:0 "Transcaucasian Diplomacy"
ARM_Transcaucasian_Diplomacy_desc:0 "Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia - once we were a united, but a short-lived state. This idea should be renewed and we should establish good diplomatic ties with our neighbors and resolve all territorial disputes."

ARM_question_of_kilykia:0 "Question of Anatolia"
ARM_question_of_kilykia_desc:0 "The Turks are defeated, but they still own some lands that are our natural claims. The Cilician province was once a great Armenian state. This idea should be revived..."


### Ideas ###
ARM_unite_fedayi_idea:0 "United Fidayi"
ARM_unite_fedayi_idea_desc:0 "The Fidayi volunteers have been strictly organised into divisions and battalions with a clear command structure. This allows our soldiers to carry out our plans with utmost efficiency, and will result in less costly and overall more successful military operations."

ARM_unite_fedayi_idea2:0 "A Modern Army"
ARM_unite_fedayi_idea2_desc:0 "The command structure of our military has been modernised and professionalised. Just like the armies of Europe and North America, ours too now consists of well-disciplined and well-trained soldiers, ready to defend their homeland no matter the cost."

ARM_separate_fedayi_idea:0 "Separated Fidayi"
ARM_separate_fedayi_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to maintain the separated nature of our Fidayi volunteers, which allows them to act independently and quickly. Furthermore, the requirements for joining these irregular units were kept relatively low, creating a broader pool of eligible recruits."

ARM_separate_fedayi_idea2:0 "Fidayi Guerrillas"
ARM_separate_fedayi_idea2_desc:0 "Our decentralised force is more than capable of waging an all out Guerrilla war. Our soldiers shall hide in the mountains and forests and strike our foes when and where they will least expect it, allowing us to inflict a great amount of casualties while suffering barely any ourselves."

ARM_fight_till_the_end:0 "Fight until the End!"
ARM_fight_till_the_end_desc:0 "The Armenian people have been given a taste of liberty, something they've been starving for for years. We may not surrender the newfound freedoms of our people so easily! We shall achieve the dream of an Armenian state free from Turkish rule, or we shall die trying!"

ARM_temporary_unity:0 "Temporary Unity"
ARM_temporary_unity_desc:0 "Though the different political parties of our nation may not agree on everything, there's one thing that is of utmost importance for all of them: the independence of the Armenian state. With this goal in mind, they've decided to lay aside their differences and to focus on the common enemy...for now."

ARM_destroyed_recovery:0 "Destroyed Economy"
ARM_destroyed_recovery_desc:0 "The outbreak of our independence war has had a severe impact on our economy. Facilities have been destroyed, workers were drawn to the front lines, and trade with other countries has come to a halt. It will take some time for our economy to fully recover."

ARM_destroyed_recovery_1:0 "Slow Economic Recovery"
ARM_destroyed_recovery_1_desc:0 "With the war being won, our economy is ready to begin the process of recovery.

ARM_social_chaos:0 "Social Chaos"
ARM_social_chaos_desc:0 "Not only our economy, but also our people have been hurt by the war. There are countless Armenian souls who have lost everything: their job, their home, even their family. It is up to us to bring hope into their lives and to save them from falling into poverty."

ARM_planned_economy:0 "Planned Economy"
ARM_planned_economy_desc:0 "With every step of our economic recovery being planned by our government politicians, we can assure that resources are allocated where they are needed the most.

ARM_agrarian_development:0 "Agricultural Development Scheme"
ARM_agrarian_development_desc:0 "Without farmers, our society could not exist. Seeing how reliant we are on them, it is only fair that we use a part of our resources to raise their living standards and to develop their means of production. This will also increase our agricultural output and thus reduce the risk of famines in the future."

ARM_military_budget:0 "Rising Military Expenditures"
ARM_military_budget_desc:0 "The only way to fully safeguard our independence is to maintain a well-financed military. With rising military expenditures comes more modern equipment, greater capabilities of our military facilities, and thus also a better chance for our nation to survive the wars to come."

ARM_military_budget_2:0 "Greatly Financed Military"
ARM_military_budget_2_desc:0 "The only way to fully safeguard our independence is to maintain a well-financed military.

ARM_vaccination_campaign:0 "National Vaccination Campaign"
ARM_vaccination_campaign_desc:0 "Throughout history, plagues and diseases have been the cause of many deaths. However, with the help of modern medicine, we can contain the spread of certain diseases and limit their influence on the health of our people. Soon, every Armenian will be vaccinated, and the mortality rate drop tremendously."

ARM_national_army_idea:0 "The Armenian Army"
ARM_national_army_idea_desc:0 "Just like our people, our army too is defiant, determined, and unbreakable. Our soldiers value the freedom of their country more than even their own lives, and will defend it fighting tooth and nail, side by side with their brethren."

ARM_armenian_defiance_desc:0 "The Armenian people are known for their courage, their patriotism, and their iron will.

ARM_armenian_defiance_3:0 "Armenian Defiance"
ARM_armenian_defiance_3_desc:0 "For centuries, the Turkish tyrants tried to shatter the will of the Armenian people, but they stood defiant and resisted. This defiance is what saved our people from their certain doom, what brought them their independence, and what will keep our nation alive in years to come."

ARM_expansionism_idea:0 "Armenian Expansionism"
ARM_expansionism_idea_desc:0 "For far too long, other countries have been able to push as around as they please because of our inferior numbers and lack of both strength and territory. It is time for us to evolve from simple prey to apex predators, and to acquire the land needed for Armenia to become a force to be reckoned with."

ARM_armenian_youth:0 "Armenian Youth Movement"
ARM_armenian_youth_desc:0 "The politicisation of our people has to start at a very young age, lest their minds be poisoned by western ideas.

ARM_armenian_last_stand_desc:0 "Although our independence has been secured for the moment, there are numerous countries eyeing up our lands.

### Events ###
arm.0.t:0 "Vilayet of Erivan in 1936"
arm.0.d:0 "With the collapse of Russia, the newborn Republic of Armenia was forced to stand alone against Turkish power. In the end, Armenia was able to secure independence, but soon the situation will rapidly deteriorate. \n\nIn the middle of 1919, at the final stage of the war, Armenia was still free, and the Armenian resistance in the mountains was fiercely resisting the Ottoman and Azerbaijani troops. \nThe Caucasian Conference of 1919 erased Armenia from the map. Armenia, which was not even invited to the conference, suddenly faced annihilation from all sides, betrayed by both its neighbors and foreign powers. What followed would be called at the international level the "partition of Armenia".\n\nMeanwhile, in Yerevan, the extremely unstable Ottomans created a more or less autonomous vilayet in order to maintain calm in the region. The main part of the Armenian nationalist movement, led by Garegin Nzhdeh, moved to the south, to the unorganized territories held by Azerbaijan. The guerrilla war in the countryside continued, and Armenian nationalists launched a campaign of retaliation against high-ranking government officials of the Ottoman Empire and Azerbaijan.\n\nWhile the mountains of Karabakh and Zangezur remained a stronghold of Armenian freedom fighters until the late 1920s and early 1930s, the region around Yerevan eventually finally calmed down. Yerevan, which the Turkish administration called \"Erivan\", gradually turned into a bustling provincial city of the Ottoman Empire with a rich Turkish elite.\n\nIn 1935, Kazim Karabekir was appointed Governor of Erivan. As a relatively liberal governor, primarily interested in the armed forces, without any real prejudice towards the Armenian nation, he allowed a small political liberalization in the vilayet, giving the Armenian population the opportunity to participate in local politics. With the wind of change on the horizon, the future of the Armenian vilayet seems bright; however, the exiled ultranationalists in the south still have not come to terms with the loss of their nation and will fight for their country and identity, no matter what happens."
arm.0.a:0 "Armenia is not yet lost...?"

arm.1.t:0 "The War of Armenian Independence"
arm.1.d:0 "For centuries, foreign invaders have ruled the Armenian people. The Russians, Persians, and Ottomans all thought they had a righteous claim on our lands, resulting in numerous border conflicts between these powers. Even though the Armenian territories generally enjoyed relative autonomy, the Armenians themselves were typically treated poorly by their occupiers. The Turks, in particular, viewed them as second-class citizens that needed to be 'Turkified'. This belief led directly to the Hamidian massacres of 1894-1896 and the Armenian massacres during the Weltkrieg. These atrocities bolstered Armenian nationalism and strengthened the resistance movements. While some of these organisations, like the Fidayi, who tried to defend Armenian villages from Turkish and Kurdish pillagers, mainly strived for autonomy and security, others, like the Dashnaks, demanded the establishment of an independent Armenian state.\n\nThis dream of a free Armenia became a reality in 1918. After the Russian Empire collapsed, the Armenians used the resulting chaos to secede. However, about a year after we declared independence, the regional powers convened a conference in Kostantiniyye. The result: the Ottomans, Georgia, and Azerbaijan were to carve up Armenia between themselves. This agreement was the final blow for the First Republic of Armenia, which lacked the strength to defend itself against its neighbours.\n\nStill, our people did not lose hope. They continued to wait for the day they would finally be free, with some retreating to Karabakh to continue the resistance there. With the Middle East rising against the Sublime Porte and the Turks struggling to hold their own against the Arab forces, it seems that this day has finally come. Today we say enough! Throughout the country, volunteers are organising militias, and Turkish garrisons are getting disarmed. It is time to show the Ottomans that we cannot be so easily broken! For Armenia!"

arm.2.t:0 "Rebellion Against the Ottoman Empire!"
arm.2.d:0 "With war breaking out across the Middle East, and the Ottoman Empire that has ruled over us for decades beginning to collapse, now might be the only chance we have to rebel against our overlords. Nzhdeh's fedayi are ready to take over Erivan, and raise the flag of an independent Armenia once again."
arm.2.a:0 "For Armenia!"

arm.3.t:0 "The Return of Nzhdeh"
arm.3.d:0 "Seeing the Armenian people rise up against Ottoman rule, Garegin Nzhdeh decided to return from his self-imposed exile in High Karabakh. Nzhdeh is a renowned soldier and general. He participated in the Persian Constitutional Revolution and was part of Armenian battalions fighting under Russian flag. During the collapse of the Russian Empire, he retreated to the Caucasus, where he became one of the founders of the Armenian National Army.\n\nWith his new paramilitary forces, he tried to strengthen Armenia's position in the Caucasus by expelling Turks and Azeris from the region. However, the Ottomans were quick to retaliate and managed to squash the Armenian resistance by mid 1919. Nzhdeh, having failed to protect Armenia against the advancing Turks, decided to retreat and to reorganise his forces in the mountains of High Karabakh, a province which had previously belonged to Armenia, but was awarded to Azerbaijan during the Caucasus Conference. There, he continued to fight for the independence of an Armenian state. Nzhdeh terrorised the non-Armenian inhabitants of the region and made it impossible for the Azeri government to govern the province. Throughout the years, he also managed to gain substantial influence in the Caucasus, which he used to supply Armenian resistance movements even outside of Karabakh, making him partially responsible for the success our forces experienced thus far.\n\nNow that Nzhdeh has fully and officially returned to Armenia, he can use his experience gathered in decades of conventional and guerrilla warfare to lead our troops to victory against the savage Turks. Already, the people are cheering him and celebrating his arrival as a 'blessing of the lord'. With him guiding our way, nothing can stop us!"
arm.3.a:0 "We welcome our hero!"

arm.4.t:0 "Diplomatic Overtures From Lebanon"
arm.4.d:0 "Despite its relatively small size, Lebanon is home to one of the largest Armenian diasporas in the Middle East. Seeking refuge from the Ottoman military during the times of the Armenian Massacres, thousands of Armenians fled the regions of eastern and southern Anatolia, and, with nowhere else to go, many made their way down towards Lebanon. There, they settled down mainly in the autonomous Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon, but also in surrounding cities such as Beirut and Jbeil. Because of the mostly welcoming nature of the locals, the migrants were able to integrate rather quickly, and Armenian culture is to this day seen as a valuable enrichment to life in the region.\n\nHaving just declared their independence after a devastating war against the Syrians, it could be said that the struggles the Lebanese people had to endure are very much comparable to those our own nation had to face in the past. They too saw themselves forced to hold their own against a much larger foe, and just like us, they stood triumphant in the end. However, now that the war has been won, Lebanon is experiencing the same downside of independence that we did: political solitude. Hoping to solve this problem, [LEB.GetLeader] has now reached out to our government and has expressed his wish to establish diplomatic relations between our two states. Seeing the cultural ties that bind our two nations and the benefits that future cooperation could bring, it should not come as a surprise that our government has already decided to accept this offer and to organise the establishment of a Lebanese embassy in our capital. We can only hope that this day marks the beginning of a great friendship between our nations."

arm.6.d:0 "A revanchist government under [ARM.GetLeader] has taken control of the newly independent Armenian state, and now seeks to reclaim the territories it considers righteous Armenian clay. Even though the Armenian claims on our territory are laughable at best, the historic ties between some of our provinces and the Armenian people seem to be enough of a justification for an invasion to them. Already, their troops are mobilising on our shared border, and it is only a matter of time until they are going to try to cross into our lands. We should prepare our defences and send this ultranationalist scum back to where it belongs!"
arm.6.a:0 "They will be crushed!"

arm.7.t:0 "Armenian-Turkish Reconciliation"
arm.7.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire, a country that has subjugated and mistreated our people for centuries, is no longer what it once used to be. The defeat in the Desert War has changed the nation, not just by reducing its territory, but also by causing political turmoil, which forced the Turks to pursue a different political course. Whilst a large part of our population hates the Turks with every fiber of their being, this reckless hate is no longer justified. The people living next to us are no longer the people who terrorised us for most of our recent history. We should try to officially reconcile with the Turks, for both our nations' sakes. Hopefully, they'll be as wise and understanding as we are, and accept our modest proposal."
arm.7.a:0 "What could possibly go wrong?"

arm.8.t:0 "Reconciliation with [ARM.GetNameDef]?"
arm.8.d:0 "Earlier this week, a proposal from our Armenian neighbours reached [TUR.Capital.GetName]. In it, the Armenian leadership pledged for the signing of a treaty of friendship between our two nations, showing that they are willing to evolve beyond the age-old hostilities that have divided our people for centuries. Nevertheless, some parts of our government see this proposal as outrageous, arguing that Armenia should be considered a Turkish province and as such be reintegrated into our country. Furthermore, many politicians still remember the bloody war our two nations fought against one another vividly, and think that official reconciliation between [TUR.GetNameDef] and Armenia would be disrespectful towards the victims of said war. Still, there are also some saying that a treaty of friendship could help secure peace in the region, and would bring advantages for both sides. Although this may be true, if we were to accept this proposal, we would also have to defend Armenia against anyone trying to invade the country in the future - a risk that has to be calculated carefully."

arm.9.t:0 "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] Agrees!"
arm.9.d:0 "Great news! The Turks have accepted our treaty of reconciliation, citing that the hostilities between our two countries have thus far been disadvantageous to both of our nations. In the name of peace, they officially recognised Armenia as an independent state and the Armenian people as free from Turkish rule. Furthermore, the Turks promised to defend us against any threats that may arise in the future. A new era of Turkish-Armenian friendship has begun!"
arm.9.a:0 "Finally, we can live in peace!"

arm.10.t:0 "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] Refuses!"
arm.10.d:0 "Sadly, it appears that the Turks are not yet ready for such drastic changes as a treaty of friendship with our nation. Citing that Armenia has 'always been a Turkish province, and will soon be one again', the government of [TUR.GetNameDef] has refused to sign our proposal. Thus, the Turks have proven to be unable to evolve beyond their ultranationalist mindset, which could very well lead to another war between our two nations in the near future."
arm.10.a:0 "Their loss..."

arm.16.t:0 "The Communists Attempt Putsch"
arm.16.d:0 "With Nzhdeh becoming elected the leader of Armenia, the Communist Party of Anastas Mikoyan has publicly denounced the new regime. They demanded that the Dashnak government should immediately surrender to the Proletarian government of people. They have reminded about Nzhdeh's ultranationalist ideas and authoritarian tendency. Shortly after this news had spread throughout the country, Mikoyan gave a speech on the radio. In it, he promised that his policies would bring Armenia the peace and prosperity it deserves.\n\nThe democratic government has already denounced Mikoyan in response and Nzhdeh demanded for the Communists to surrender. The workers are already striking in Yerevan and the future of Armenia remains uncertain."

arm.17.t:0 "The Hunchaks Triumph"
arm.17.d:0 "The First Armenian Popular Assembly has concluded, and the representatives are slowly starting their journey back home. After all the different issues had been voted on and the votes had been counted, a clear winner was determined: the Hunchaks under Sarkis Rouben Ter Minassian. As it seems, the representatives, and thus the people, do not want radical changes, but rather strive for moderate reforms capable of improving their living situation. In an address he gave to the press this morning, Minassian gave himself relatively unsurprised, saying that he had not once doubted that the assembly would choose the Hunchak party to lead the nation. Still, he thanked the people for their support and promised to bring them equality and liberty.\n\nWith the moderates now setting the agenda, the more radical Communists seem to be a tad bit disappointed. Though they still think that the Hunchak reforms won't be enough to truly change the Armenian nation for the better, they refrained from openly questioning the decision of the assembly and promised the Hunchaks their continued support. With the Hunchak-led coalition now guiding our way, peace and prosperity have become imminent!"

Hoping to receive some foreign support from the Internationale, the Armenian government has requested our assistance with their economic buildup. Considering our economic might, sending a few engineers and materials to our friends in need certainly wouldn't hurt us. Still, some have argued that we need our resources elsewhere, and that they would be wasted in Armenia. While this may be somewhat true, we can't just turn our socialist brethren down, can we?"

It seems as if we are the only true socialists left on this planet..."
arm.20.a:0 "This is outrageous! It's unfair!"

arm.21.t:0 "The Remaining Collaborators"
arm.21.d:0 "When our rebellion began, some officials loyal to the Ottoman Empire fled Armenia, fearing prosecution and imprisonment if they were to stay. However, there were also members of the administration and the military that simply switched sides at the beginning of the war, saying that they would rather live in a free Armenian state than in one dominated by the Turks. These men have thus far been able to keep the positions they held under Ottoman rule, partly because it would not be an easy task to replace them. Nevertheless, it appears that Nzhdeh, who has by now become a hero of the Armenian people with substantial influence, is all but content with this situation.\n\nArguing that these officials cannot be trusted because of their affiliations with the vicious Ottoman Empire, he has now begun to take matters into his own hands. Today, he ordered the imprisonment of every "collaborator" still on Armenian soil. Whilst this has raised some suspicion, seeing as his definition of a collaborator is relatively loose and encompasses every official that has served under Ottoman rule, there has been no real opposition to these orders yet. Throughout the country, officials are getting escorted out of their workplaces by the military, officers are being discharged, and prisons are starting to fill up. Although Nzhdeh promised that he is doing all that just to secure Armenia's independence and security, this move also, coincidentally, created a power vacuum that he can now easily fill by appointing his own officials loyal to his cause."
arm.21.a:0 "A harsh but necessary step."

arm.22.t:0 "The Collaborators Resist!"
arm.22.d:0 "Although the arrest of the first wave of collaborators went off without a hitch, this was mainly because the military caught them off guard. By now, every Armenian knows of the prosecution of those that Nzhdeh branded enemies of the state. The remaining collaborators used the time they had to prepare themselves. Many of them went into hiding and have thus far been unlocatable. Since they can't just vanish off the face of the earth, it is suspected that they either fled the country, hoping to start a new life in their beloved Ottoman Empire, or have found refuge in the homes of Armenians willing to hide them from the eyes of the government. A few houses of friends and family members of the prosecuted have already been searched by the military, which has sparked some discontent, but has also resulted in the capture of some of the fugitives.\n\nNonetheless, a few collaborators have also been unwilling to leave their beloved home behind. Instead of hiding from the forces of the government, they chose to arm themselves. Our soldiers have by now reported almost a dozen instances of former officials opening fire on them. Luckily, none of our soldiers have been killed thus far, though some have been seriously injured. What makes these incidents alarming is the fact that almost all of the guns used by those resisting the arrest were weapons that could commonly be found in the Ottoman military. Either the collaborators stole them from the stockpiles we have captured from the Ottoman garrisons, or they still have contacts within the Empire, looking to fuel resistance against Nzhdeh's rule. Either way, we should try to disarm and imprison these traitors as quickly as possible."
arm.22.a:0 "They just had to make this hard..."

arm.23.t:0 "Nzhdeh Declares the State of Emergency"
arm.23.d:0 "Arguing that our nation needs a strong and united government to survive the oncoming Ottoman onslaught, Nzhdeh and the leadership of the military have decided to proclaim the state of emergency, effectively centralising the power of the state around themselves. This gives them the freedom to rule without taking the opposition into account, to pursue whatever policies they please, and to take any measures they deem necessary to save the Armenian nation from its total annihilation. To pacify those who believe this is nothing but the disguised establishment of a dictatorship under military rule, Nzhdeh assured that he would lift the state of emergency once the war has been won and the dust has settled.\n\nWhile there are parts of the population that aren't satisfied with this promise, fearing that Nzhdeh and the military officers will grow too attached to the power they now possess, the majority of Armenia is quite content with this development. In Nzhdeh, the people see a man that knows what has to be done. They see someone who takes action instead of making promises he can never fulfil. In him, they see a figurehead that can unify the Armenian people - a trait that is urgently needed in these trying times. However, it remains to be seen how far the support of the people really goes, and if it will last after the war has been won and Armenia's independence is no longer directly threatened."
arm.23.a:0 "May they lead us to victory!"

arm.24.t:0 "Nzhdeh Centralises His Power"
arm.24.d:0 "Since Nzhdeh declared the state of emergency, he has ruled over our nation together with the military leadership. However, it appears that his position in the government did not fully satisfy him. He wanted to centralise power around himself instead of sharing it, and has been pushing the military further into the background whilst trying to keep it loyal to him. Today, his endeavours have finally borne fruit, as he has officially been proclaimed leader of the Armenian state with the blessing of the military leadership. Whilst this new title doesn't change too much on paper, seeing as he has been pulling the strings in the government for quite a while now, it has caused some uncertainty in the populace.\n\nAfter Nzhdeh was proclaimed sole leader of Armenia, two camps formed within our population. On one side, there are Nzhdeh's followers. They claim that he is the only one capable of leading the Armenian people into their future and that he will bring them their long-desired victory over the Turks. For them, Nzhdeh's takeover is justified by his abilities and certainly nothing to be worried about.\n\nOn the other side, there are those sceptical of Nzhdeh and his regime. This camp mainly consists of the democrats and revolutionaries that have been denouncing Nzhdeh's authoritarian ways ever since he returned to Armenia. They see him as a threat to the freedom and liberty of the Armenian people, fearing that he won't end the state of emergency after the war has been won and will instead try to cement his power even further. To prevent this from happening, the democrats now want to search for new allies in the military, the administration, and the government. If they manage to convince enough officials of the threat that Nzhdeh poses, maybe they can stop him from consolidating his rule. But are they willing to risk attracting Nzhdeh's wrath?"

arm.25.d:0 "Ever since Nzhdeh returned to our nation, the democrats have seen themselves slowly lose power and influence. Until now, they have accepted this development, hoping that Nzhdeh would lead our nation to victory if they granted him the freedoms he desires. However, they are all but content with how the situation turned out. In their eyes, Nzhdeh has thus far not only used his powers for the good of the Armenian people, but also for his own personal gains - something that they deem unacceptable. In order to regain their influence in our nation's politics, the Dashnaks and the Ramgavar, the two main democratic parties of our country, have issued a joint request in which they demanded a place in the new government.\n\nWhilst Nzhdeh is in no way obliged to accept this request and could very well turn the democrats down, a few of his associates have pointed out that this may not be the best idea. After all, we are currently fighting a war against the Turks and should try to stay united at least until the conflict has been resolved, lest we collapse under the weight of our internal struggles. Furthermore, we don't have to give the democrats the most influential positions. Even a few smaller and non-important ones could satisfy them and guarantee that they stay loyal to Nzhdeh and his political course."

arm.26.d:0 "The day our people have been waiting for for generations has finally come! We have beaten the notorious Turks and driven them out of our lands! While they weep and mourn for their losses, the people of Armenia celebrate, for they can now once again live in freedom and liberty. However, this victory came at a cost. Many young Armenian men lost their lives, our economy has been utterly destroyed, and the Turkish part of our population is beginning to migrate to Anatolia, fearing suppression and persecution under their new Armenian overlords. Still, these losses shouldn't ruin the good mood of the people, at least for the moment. After all, our economy can be rebuilt, our soldiers knew that they gave their lives for something worth fighting for, and citizens loyal to the Turkish state would only corrupt our young nation.\n\nNonetheless, there have also been some rather unpleasant developments in our nation's politics. While celebrations are still taking place across the country, the different political parties of our nation have already begun falling out with each other. With our triumph over the Turks, there's no longer an immediate threat unifying our politicians, leading to them now once again fighting for their own interests. The democrats and revolutionaries have demanded free elections in order to replace Nzhdeh, arguing that he is no longer needed and his continued rule illegitimate. Meanwhile, Nzhdeh is trying to hold on to his power, saying that his victories have earned him the right to rule over the Armenian people. Seeing the differences between the two sides, it seems nigh impossible for them to reach an agreement. Our victory has turned our government into a powder keg waiting to explode."

arm.27.t:0 "The Formation of the Survival Party"
arm.27.d:0 "A few days back, Garegin Nzhdeh surprised Hovhannes Kajaznuni, the leader of the democratic Dashnak party, by inviting him to a private conversation in his personal residence. While the exact content of their discussion remains unknown, the meeting lasted almost the entire night, and ended with Kajaznuni being convinced of Nzhdeh's good intentions and his capabilities as the leader of our nation. This change of mind animated Kajaznuni to better Nzhdeh's image within the ranks of his party, leading to the Dashnaks officially deciding to form a coalition with Nzhdeh's military junta. This coalition, which has the main political goal of safeguarding the independence of the Armenian state, has adequately been nicknamed the 'Survival Party'.\n\nWith the arguably most influential part of the democratic opposition now on his side, Nzhdeh has effectively cemented his power, with no other political faction being strong enough to challenge his rule. Naturally, the other democratic and revolutionary parties were all but content with the decision of the Dashnaks, and have branded them 'traitors to the democratic cause'. Still, the Dashnak part of the newly-formed coalition tried to get on their good side, promising progressive reforms in the economy and the Armenian social system, and arguing that an alliance with Nzhdeh was a necessary step to ensure Armenia's continued independence.\n\nFor the population, this news has been a blessing. Nzhdeh's experience and qualities as a leader and the democratic views of the Dashnaks seem to be the perfect ingredients for a prosperous Armenian state. The people trust the Survival Party, and expect nothing but peace, freedom, justice and security under their new leadership."

arm.28.t:0 "The Birth of Tseghakronism"
arm.28.d:0 "As Nzhdeh returned to Armenia, he realised that none of the established political parties were fully capable of representing his political views. For him, the revolutionaries and democrats are weak for seeking to legitimise their rule through elections. Furthermore, some of these parties think that we should reconciliate with our neighbours and make friends of them - something that Nzhdeh views as another sign of their weakness. Because of his dissatisfaction with the current Armenian political scene, he has begun developing the ideology of his own - an ideology of strong Armenians.\n\nIn Nzhdeh's eyes, Armenia should strive for unity through the power of nationalism. Nzhdeh's goals of ridding our nation of those that seek to destroy it and renewing the national and spiritual identity of our people have become the centre of his new ideology, which he named Tseghakronutyun or Tseghakronism, essentially translating to 'race and religion' - two concepts which Nzhdeh wants to turn into the pillars of our society. Already, people throughout Armenia are announcing their support for Nzhdeh and his new ideas, and are rallying behind the 'Eagle of Taron', the central icon of Tseghakronism."

arm.29.t:0 "Democracy Prevails!"
arm.29.d:0 "With the war being won, many people feel that Nzhdeh is no longer needed. Whilst his skills as a military leader may have contributed greatly to our recent victory, a large part of the population questions his capabilities as a leader during times of peace, and is now beginning to turn to the democratic parties. These parties have also not been inactive, and have been gathering support among the common folk, but also in the administration and the government. With virtually all of Armenia standing behind them, they were able to borderline force Nzhdeh to concede and to accept that elections should decide the future of our nation. Until then, he will keep his position, promising to keep order until the elections have come to a conclusion and a clear winner has been determined.\n\nThroughout the country, the preparations for the first Armenian elections in over twenty years have begun, and the people are excited to be able to choose their nation's government once again. From now on, Armenia shall be considered a shining jewel of liberty and democracy in the otherwise so sinister lands of the Caucasus and the Middle East."

arm.30.t:0 "The Final Step"
arm.30.d:0 "Ever since the birth of Tseghakronism, Nzhdeh and his followers have been working on turning this new ideology into the central political agenda of the state. By now, most of the soldiers and officers that have served under Nzhdeh during our independence war have joined the new organisation, arguing that he has shown his qualities as a leader and that his ideas will bring Armenia the glory it has always desired. With the support of the military, Nzhdeh was able to cement his power without any opposition from the democratic parties, who have by now become too irrelevant to pose a threat to the new regime. Because of this, Nzhdeh has decided that they should not be outright dissolved, instead allowing them to continue to operate within the country. Still, with elections being frowned upon by the Tseghakronutyun, these parties have no real chance of ever coming to power.\n\nThese new political developments have, however, raised some uncertainty within the population. Although most of our citizens trust Nzhdeh, many view his new political course with scepticism. In particular, the minorities within our borders, such as the Azeris and the Turks, are now fearing for their rights and their lives. In an address Nzhdeh gave to the nation this morning, he once again promised to take any steps necessary to ensure the continued survival of the Armenian people and gave his word that he would rid our country of all those who stand in the way of his rule and his promised prosperity - a promise that has only fueled the fears of both the minorities and the opposition. It remains to be seen if the people will trust Nzhdeh to the end, or if their fear will lead them to divergent paths."

arm.31.d:0 "Elections are drawing ever closer, and the two contesting coalitions have now begun to use their resources for election advertising. In order to convince the people of their political goals and agendas, both camps are now sending their most prominent politicians to radio stations and newspapers. With the help of these modern media outlets, they can appeal to the entire nation with ease.\n\nThe liberal Ramgavar, who has a relatively wide base of supporters, containing entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and to a lesser extent also the common workers, are challenging the more socialist-minded Hunchaks and Dashnaks.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunchaks are also trying to convince the lower classes of their policies. They denounce the democrats as hypocrites, and argue that the liberals only seek to represent the interests of the capitalist upper class, not the hard-working men of Armenia.\n\nWith both factions fighting over the votes of one class, the workers and farmers of our country now essentially find themselves in the position of kingmaker. The more interesting position is within the ARF-Dashnaktsutyun, who are likely to form a coalition with either Liberals or Hunchaks.\n\nSoon we shall know which side was more convincing in the eyes of the common folk."

Over the course of the day, the polling stations were almost constantly filled with people - the voter turnout was immense. Now that the day is nearing its end and everyone that wanted to participate in the vote has cast their ballot, the polling stations are beginning to close down. The first stations have already reported the results of the election in their area, but for now there seems to be a rather fragile balance between the revolutionaries and the democrats, with both sides having gained around half of the votes. Still, this will most likely be subject to change, as the largest polling stations have not yet finished the process of counting the ballots. The tension and excitement can be felt on both sides - but in the end, there can be only one winner."

However, our politicians did not just sit back and throw a party - they also began addressing the issues that came with their victory in the election. For example, we cannot pursue the political agendas of both the Dashnaks and the Ramgavar, but rather have to choose whose policies we should put our focus on. To that end, it has been decided that an election committee consisting of politicians from the Dashnak and Ramgavar parties as well as some neutral statesmen shall be formed. This election committee will choose a candidate from either the Dashnak or Ramgavar party for the post of president, who shall then set the course of our nation and decide on the policies that will lead our people into their future.\n\nBoth parties have already determined their candidates. The Dashnaks have chosen Hovhannes Kajaznuni, a man known throughout the country for his service as prime minister of the First Armenian Republic during the closing stages of the Weltkrieg. He is an advocate of social reform and, in contrast to the Ramgavar, thinks that at least some revolutionary ideas should not necessarily be frowned upon by our government. The Ramgavar, on the other hand, have chosen Mihran Damadian, a former resistance fighter who believes in more liberal policies and the power of the free market. After both candidates gave a speech highlighting why they should be elected president, there were some debates and discussions among the members of the committee, but now it seems that they've managed to come to a conclusion.

Each party will receive a certain amount of seats based on the amount of electoral districts in which it managed to gain a majority, with some of these districts being worth more seats than others, based on their population. Although this election will not directly determine the political course of our nation in the future, since that has already been decided in the presidential election, it will still give the winning party a significant increase in influence."

arm.35.d:0 "With the Ottoman Turks still unable to put an end to our relentless advance, we have now finally reached the port city of Batumi, and with it, the beautiful shores of the Black Sea. Founded by the ancient Greeks centuries before the birth of Christ, the practically ancient city has switched hands several times in recent history between the Russians, Georgians, and Ottomans. As such, Batumi is nowadays home to a plethora of different cultures and religions, including an Armenian minority, with Georgians, however, forming a slight majority.\n\nThough the Ottoman garrison stationed in the city fought fiercely until the bitter end, they did not have time to destroy or evacuate all that could be of use to us, allowing our soldiers to confiscate a handful of convoys stationed in the city's harbour, with a number of Armenian civilians even volunteering to join our fight against the Ottoman Turks. More important than the spoils of war, however, is that Batumi finally gives our nation access to the seas beyond our mountainous home.\n\nBecause of this, and because the Georgians have thus far refused to join the war and are thus not in a position to enforce their claim on the city, some have suggested we should lay claim to Batumi ourselves. Although we could naturally veil our true motives for this under the guise of wanting to protect the local Armenian population from the Turkish brutes, and although control over the city would bring our nation great benefits, claiming it would surely anger the Georgians - and might even tempt them to declare war on our nation should our ownership of the city become official. Furthermore, our current rule over Batumi is still shaky at best, and the Ottomans will without a doubt soon launch a counter-offensive, especially considering that we have not yet found the time to properly entrench our positions. How should we proceed?"

arm.36.d:0 "A few days back, the Yerevan Film Studio blessed our nation's cinemas with the release of a new movie: Nazar the Brave. This comedy was written by Derenik Demirchyan and Amasi Martirosyan, and is based on the popular folk tale that goes by the same name. Because the story is loved and known throughout the country, our people have been awaiting the movie for a while now and were more than eager to watch it on the day of its release.\n\nThe movie tells the story of Nazar, a lazy and cowardly man who has more luck than judgement. One day, he jokes about robbing the caravan of a Shah passing nearby, but his wife takes him seriously and demands that he stays true to his word. Although he wants to chicken out of it at first, he later gets annoyed by some flies and manages to kill a thousand of them with a single swat. This gives him courage, and the village priest thereafter gifts him a rag on which he wrote 'Nazar the Brave, who fear does not know, kills a thousand with a single blow!'. Confident in his abilities, Nazar then sets out to find the Shah, and through sheer luck manages to outsmart a bandit, whose horse he then takes with him. Then follows coincidence after coincidence, eventually leading to Nazar's name being known and feared throughout the world - and not just that, he also kills a dangerous tiger, becomes king of a realm of giants, marries a giantess, and lives happily ever after.\n\nThe movie was well-received, and people are calling it both hilarious and exciting. Overall, it appears to be a good distraction from the shocking news coming from other parts of the world, and could very well become a classic that our people will still watch decades from now."

Whilst he had only mild success in achieving this goal, the time he spent in these countries, or rather in their restaurants, inspired him to bring new western-style food to our nation, namely corn flakes, popcorn, hamburgers, and ice cream, the latter being especially important to him.\n\nTo ensure our citizens always have access to the best ice cream, the government has, at the recommendation of Mikoyan, sponsored the construction of the first Armenian ice cream factory, which is to be built in our capital city of Yerevan. Mikoyan also plans to keep the quality of our domestically produced ice cream under his own personal control, arguing that he knows best what makes it delicious. Furthermore, he invented a new kind of hamburger beef patty, the so-called 'Mikoyan Cutlet'. He promised that this cutlet, which is made from beef or pork, would keep the burgers affordable for the common folk and make Armenian hamburgers something unique and outstanding, maybe even something known throughout the world.\n\nAlthough some are beginning to joke about Mikoyan's obsession with food and especially ice cream, a large part of the population welcomes these changes to the Armenian diet. For them, they are something exciting and out of the ordinary, and also give a feeling of a more westernised and modern lifestyle. This reaction of the populace has strengthened his belief in the importance of the right nourishment and has now even encouraged him to write a book on the topic of healthy and tasty food."

arm.38.d:0 "With the Tseghakronutyun growing more powerful and influential by the day, the only thing they are still afraid of is losing their power. Hence, Nzhdeh decided that certain measures would have to be taken in order to ensure the survival of the new regime.\n\nThese measures, which Nzhdeh described as 'necessary evils that will safeguard the prosperity of the Armenian nation', are mostly aimed at restraining the freedoms and liberties of the Armenian people. Especially concepts such as freedom of speech and freedom of thought are being disregarded and have been declared 'poisonous to the integrity of the state'. From now on, all newspapers will be controlled and strictly censored by the Tseghakronutyun. Publishing critical literature or spreading pamphlets criticising the government has now officially been declared a crime and will be punished severely. In order to ensure that the people understand that this should not be taken lightly, the party also ordered the expansion of most Armenian detention facilities, hoping that increasing their capacities will scare the Armenian people away from critical thought and bring even the most die-hard defenders of democratic values into the fold."

arm.39.t:0 "The Expulsion Act"
arm.39.d:0 "As it seems, the measures currently in place were just the beginning of Nzhdeh's efforts to shatter any resistance against the government. In his eyes, some people currently living inside our country will never be loyal subjects to his regime, and should thus be considered enemies of the state.\n\nToday, he introduced the 'Expulsion Act'. With this act, he wants to rid the nation of these 'Takanks' in order to bring our people stability and unity. It states that 'every Azeri and Turk is to leave the territory of the Armenian state within the span of three weeks. Should they refuse to leave within the given time span, the military will be authorised to expel them from their homes. Should they not comply, usage of force is permitted.'\n\nNaturally, this has sparked outrage among the Muslim population of the country, since Turks and Azeris alike now see themselves being prosecuted in the lands both they and their ancestors once called their home. However, the act did not only shock the Muslim parts of our population. Many Armenians are beginning to ask themselves if Nzhdeh really does what is right and if the expulsion of people they value as neighbours, friends and colleagues really is a necessary step to safeguard the future of the Armenian nation. Many still hope that Nzhdeh heeds the calls of the populace and decides to revoke the act before it unfolds its consequences, though a decision like this seems highly unlikely, especially since most of the military still blindly follows his orders and supports him and his measures without questions."

arm.40.d:0 "Today, the streets of the Pink City ran red. Agitated by one of Nzhdeh's speeches, in which he emphasised the need for an omnipotent state, some of his devoted followers saw themselves as invested by a mission to do something about the ever-denounced 'enemies within'. In their eyes, those still seeking to undermine the influence of the Tseghakronutyun could be found in prisons, where former Ottoman administrators are still held, and in the streets, where a demonstration by Muslim citizens was organised against the Expulsion Act.\n\nArmed with improvised weapons and a few firearms, the fanatics stormed the capital's prisons and fell upon the peaceful protest. What followed was nothing short of a slaughter. As the demonstrators fled throughout the streets, many were pursued and felled: bystanders who tried to shield them from the violence, sheltering them in their homes, or simply attempting to stand between them and the mob, can be counted among the casualties. In the prisons however, it seems that the guards simply stood aside, some even joining in, as resent against the Turks runs high. As for Yerevan's garrison troops, they remained idle: many of them are receptive to Nzhdeh's rhetoric and believe that protecting Muslim or prisoner lives is not part of their duty. When night fell, dozens laid dead, and many more were injured.\n\nNews of the massacre spread throughout the country like wildfire. In an emergency broadcast addressing the tragic situation, Nzhdeh attempted to shift the blame on the victims, described as conspirators, only blaming those he suggested were merely animated by 'patriotic fervour' for taking justice in their own hands. This narrative seldom convinced those who are not entirely in the grasps of the regime, however: for many, this was the last straw. Faith in Nzhdeh among our people is beginning to crumble, and resistance to the government is organising rapidly."

arm.41.d:0 "It appears that Nzhdeh's latest measures, and especially the massacre of Yerevan, have caused the democratic parties of our country to lose all faith in the Tseghakronist movement. Today, these parties issued a joint statement, in which they declared Nzhdeh responsible for the recent bloodbath and openly demanded his resignation and the introduction of free elections on Armenian soil. Furthermore, some of them also took to the streets of the capital, and organised a memorial march to honour the victims of the massacre. However, this march became increasingly political as the number of participants increased, and ended up as an open protest against Nzhdeh's regime.\n\nSensing a threat to their rule, the Tseghakronutyun responded swiftly by ordering the military to break up the 'violent demonstration against the saviours of Armenia'. Still, Nzhdeh felt that this was not enough. He decided to go even further, and has officially decreed the dissolution of all political parties and organisations not integrated into the Tseghakronist movement. By stripping away their last political powers, he hopes to silence the remaining politicians of the opposition once and for all."

arm.42.t:0 "The Democrats Return"
arm.42.d:0 "After the banning and dissolution of their parties, the democrats found refuge in the countryside, a region not yet entirely in Nzhdeh's grasp. In their exodus out of the capital and other major cities, they were joined by some lower-ranking military officers, the most prominent of them being Boghos Bey Dadian, a former Ottoman colonel who pledged allegiance to Armenia and her people during the Desert War and has grown increasingly uncontent with Nzhdeh and his rather extreme policies. Once they no longer found themselves in any immediate danger, they began forging plans, hoping to topple the Tseghakronist government that has 'destroyed' their once so lovely country. During this time, Boghos Bey more or less officially assumed leadership of the opposition group, mostly because both the democrats and the common folk put their trust in him and his experience as an officer, confident that he could lead them to victory against the Tseghakronist regime.\n\nAfter spending some weeks gathering support and perfecting their plans, the democrats have now decided to come out of hiding and to march on to the capital. Before the news of their return could spread throughout the country, they arrived in Yerevan, where many joined their ranks before the Tseghakronutyun had time to react. In no time, they had a substantial force, consisting mainly of the common folk of our capital, on their side. As they begin their march towards the centre of the pink city, Nzhdeh is trying to organise a defence and has ordered the military to shoot anyone trying to threaten his 'righteous rule'. Since the democrats and their followers are mostly armed with improvised weapons, save for the few soldiers and officers supporting them, the army could probably prevent their coup attempt with ease. However, a large part of the city's defenders are beginning to question their own motives and are asking themselves whether they are still standing on the right side, and if the democrats really are the evil Nzhdeh makes them out to be. Today, the allegiance of these men will decide the fate of our nation."

arm.43.d:0 "Given the hunger for power and thirst for blood Nzhdeh and his Tseghakronutyun followers have demonstrated over the course of the last few months, it probably shouldn't be much of a surprise that a large part of the soldiers stationed in Yerevan decided that Tseghakronism would sooner or later be the doom of Armenia and her people, and that it is an evil that must be destroyed now before it's too late. Nzhdeh's order to open fire on their fellow countrymen was the last straw. Instead of heeding his commands, the garrison units turned on him and joined the protesters in their march towards the centre of Yerevan. The last soldiers loyal to the Tseghakron cause soon found themselves outnumbered and outgunned, and were forced to lay down their arms.\n\nAs the democrats, now with the support of both the military and the civilian population of the capital, drew ever closer to the National Assembly, the Tseghakron politicians present there acknowledged the hopelessness of their situation and surrendered without putting up much of a fight. While those who surrendered were deemed 'traitors to the state' and for now placed under house arrest by the democrats, Nzhdeh was nowhere to be found. He seemingly dropped off the face of the earth, and it is speculated that he has somehow managed to escape the capital, maybe with the help of some loyalists, and has now gone into exile, probably in Russia or another country with a government holding views similar to his.\n\nStill, Nzhdeh's whereabouts are not of great concern to Bey and his followers as of now, as they have achieved their goal: they have toppled the Tseghakronist government and can now pursue a different political course, one that isn't nearly as extreme as that of the Tseghakronutyun. With the backing of the people, the military, and the democratic politicians, Boghos Bey Dadian, leader of the coup, took the position formerly held by Nzhdeh, and now plans to fulfil the promises Nzhdeh made to the people, and to bring both peace and prosperity to Armenia."

arm.44.d:0 "Although some voices within the garrison of Yerevan stated their concerns about Nzhdeh's orders and his policies in general, they were quickly silenced by the giant wave of support for the Tseghakronist cause within the military. Heeding Nzhdeh's commands, the soldiers stopped the protesters advancing towards the centre of the capital, albeit they still refused to open fire on the civilians that joined up with the democrats. However, Boghos Bey and the soldiers accompanying him were deemed traitors to the state, a danger to the stability of the Armenian nation, and overall too dangerous to be left alive. Without any need for further orders from Nzhdeh, his loyalists fell upon these 'traitors' - and at the end of the day, Boghos Bey, a once famed and respected officer of our armed forces, laid dead in the streets of the city, killed by the men he thought would assist him in his endeavour to end Nzhdeh's rule once and for all.\n\nAs the fighting between Yerevan's garrison and Bey and his soldiers started, the crowd that promised the democrats their support quickly dispersed, fearing that they might otherwise be caught up in the crossfire. The democratic politicians that organised the coup attempt laid down their arms shortly after their leader was killed, and have by now been put in prison for their crimes against the government. With the leaders of the former opposition now being forced to spend their remaining days in dark cells, isolated from the rest of the country, the last major resistance movement against the Tseghakronist government has been crushed. Now all that is left is a general feeling of discontent among the populace, but this will likely fade away if Nzhdeh manages to fulfil his promises and to restore Armenia to its former glory."

This way, Nzhdeh hopes that he can guide both the younger and older generations in the right direction and turn them into loyal subjects to his cause.\n\nThese seven cults are: 1.The Cult of the Motherland, emphasising the importance of the land on which the Armenian culture first came into being, and promoting devotion and worship of said land. 2.The Cult of Blood, highlighting the spiritual and bodily traits that define the Armenian people, and set them apart from other cultures. 3.The Cult of Language, which forbids our people from learning or speaking any language other than their mother tongue, since this would accelerate the death of the beautiful Armenian language. 4.The Cult of the Fallen, which says that one should not forget those who gave their life in the name of Armenia and her people. Because of our recent independence war, which saw countless Armenian men dying on the fields of honour, this cult is especially important to Nzhdeh. 5.The Cult of our Ancestors. This cult declares that there is a spiritual connection between the different generations of our people, and that this connection ensures that the eternal flame of the nation and thus our sacred traditions will be passed from one generation to another. 6.The Cult of Power, which says that only those who are strong and brave will survive this cruel world. 7.The Cult of our Leader, Nzhdeh.

Whilst they promised to also assist us in our endeavours across the globe if we were to accept their offer, some voices within our government are strictly against the idea of forging an alliance with the Armenians, since this would mean acknowledging the independence of a country which once belonged to the mighty Russian Empire, and would thus also force us to give up our claim on the region.

arm.58.t:0 "Construction of the Tsitsernakaberd Memorial"
arm.58.d:0 "Almost exactly 25 years ago, the history of the Armenian people took a tragic turn, as, on the 24th of April, 1915, the Armenian Massacres began with the so-called 'Red Sunday'. Incentivised by the Tehcir Law, the Temporary Law of Deportation, the following years saw much of the historical Armenian territory outside of the mountains of Yerevan almost entirely 'cleansed' of its original inhabitants, as many of those who were not 'resettled' by the Ottomans decided that fleeing the Empire was their best bet. Naturally, most of our population has not forgotten this terror.\n\nEarlier this year, as the 25th anniversary of the 'Red Sunday' was drawing ever closer, a group of intellectuals felt that it was about time to properly honour the victims of the massacres, and came to the government with a proposal: the construction of a memorial site on the hill of Tsitsernakaberd in the centre of Yerevan. According to their proposition, this memorial should both \"be dedicated to the Armenian martyrs of the Weltkrieg\" and \"symbolise the renaissance of the Armenian people\", and thus not only serve as a way to remember the past, but also show that a better future is coming.\n\nDespite the broadness of the proposal, our government was quick to accept it and to provide the necessary funds, as the Armenian Massacres are a rather important subject for our common folk and our politicians alike. With the support of some engineers, a more exact plan was drafted, and as of now, it was decided that the monument should consist of two parts: a large stele, symbolising the rebirth of our people and the future they have ahead of them, and a circle made up of several slabs, representing the provinces of western Armenia lost to the Turks. Furthermore, the circle shall house an eternal flame in its centre, aimed at both honouring the victims of the massacres and representing the flame in the hearts of our people that will never be extinguished."

Built in the fourth century by Gregory the Illuminator, the saint who brought Christianity to our lands by convincing King Tiridates III to abandon the pagan ways of old and to embrace the cross, the cathedral has long become the centrepoint of the Armenian Apostolic Church, serving as the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians for centuries now. Furthermore, with Etchmiadzin being one of the oldest cathedrals in the world, it should not come as much of a surprise that it is also a major pilgrimage site, attracting Armenian faithful from all around the world. Because of its age, it has also been renovated multiple times throughout the years, and thus nowadays combines architectural styles from various different ages, giving the cathedral not only religious, historical, and cultural, but also architectural significance.\n\nDespite all this, however, Etchmiadzin was not spared by the war, and was hit by artillery shells and bombs on multiple occasions throughout the conflict, forcing the Catholicos to relocate to Yerevan for the time being. Seeing the turrets of the cathedral begin to crumble has understandably been a hard blow, not just to the clergy and the citizens of Vagharshapat, but to the entire country and to the Armenian diaspora abroad as well. This tragedy has not gone unnoticed by our politicians, and with our government already undertaking major endeavours to rebuild the country, it has been decided that the restoration of the cathedral, too, should be state-funded. This news has been well received, especially by the church, and many are now looking forward to seeing Etchmiadzin shine in new glamour, even if it might take some time for the restoration to complete."

Intrigued by the sight and eager to find out why he was wearing the clothing of an Armenian infantryman, our soldiers decided to approach the stranger. As they gradually caught up to him, he elected to ignore them no longer, and instead stopped his hike, sat on the ground, and waited. After a few minutes, they finally reached the man, and after a short breather, they asked him for his story and what he was doing all alone out in the mountains. He sat still for a second, but then he began to explain himself.\n\nA volunteer for the army during the War of Independence, the man was stationed on our southern border with the Turks. One night, during which he was supposed to guard the encampment of his unit, he simply dozed off, and, as fate would have it, the Turks launched a surprise attack on his position only a few hours later. Woken up by gunshots and screams, his fear got the best of him, and he ran from the ongoing battle, leaving his comrades to be routed by the enemy.\n\nThough thinking of his own survival as nothing less than a miracle, the man has not forgiven himself, and his cowardice haunts him to this day. Unwilling and unable to return to the military, he instead decided to find his peace in the quiet of the Armenian mountains, and is now wandering from peak to peak and travelling through the land, hoping to find insight and forgiveness in his self-imposed solitude."

arm.61.d:0 "Following a trail of various different artefacts and inscriptions that have been found in recent years, a group of archaeologists has managed to uncover what is probably one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in the entire Middle East - the ancient fortress of Teishebaini. Located on Kamir Blur, the 'Red Mould', the ruins lie not far from our capital city of Yerevan. Thus far, only parts of the central citadel, a few smaller buildings, and a cemetery have been uncovered, but our archaeologists are certain that much more lies buried beneath the earth, just waiting to be dug up, and some information regarding the fate and history of the town has already been unveiled.\n\nTwo different cuneiform inscriptions mentioning Rusa Argishtihini, also known as Rusa II, king of the ancient realm of Urartu, have been found and have led to the assumption that the fortress was constructed during his reign, which would in turn mean that the site dates back more than two and a half millenia, to the seventh century BC. Spanning from eastern Anatolia and north-western Persia all the way to the Armenian mountains, the kingdom of Urartu is believed to be one of the earliest predecessors to the first Kingdom of Armenia, and Scythian arrowheads that have been found within the ruins of Teishebaini have reinforced the theory that the decline and eventual fall of the kingdom was caused by a devastating war against the Scythians. As for the fortress itself, it can currently only be speculated how exactly it was destroyed, but several charred items hint at a fire razing it to the ground."

arm.62.t:0 "A New National Anthem?"
arm.62.d:0 "With our independence being secured for the moment and the political situation slowly stabilising, our government can now turn its attention to some less pressing issues. One of those is that our country is still lacking an official national anthem, something that every modern nation should have. Though our politicians agree on the criteria of a good anthem, that it should be easily recognisable and represent our people and their values, there have thus far been several proposals on which song fulfils these criteria best, and no clear winner has been determined yet.\n\nThe obvious and probably also the most popular choice would be 'Mer Hayrenik' or 'Our Fatherland', a song which was already adopted as the national anthem of the first Armenian Republic after the Weltkrieg. Its text is based on an Italian poem and was written by Mikayel Nalbandian in the 19th century, with the music being arranged by Parsegh Ganatchian a few decades later. Highlighting the glory of our fatherland and our flag, and the honour our soldiers find in death, it is a very patriotic song and perfectly reflects the struggles our people have had to endure over the course of the last few decades.\n\nSome politicians are, however, arguing that we are an entirely new state, one that will succeed where the first Republic has failed. Subsequently, they are of the opinion that our anthem should reflect that, and that an entirely new song should be composed to represent our nation. Not wanting to stray too far from 'Mer Hayrenik', though, they still want to address the same topics whilst slightly shifting the focus from our past to our future and also covering the 'rebirth' our nation has recently experienced."

Hence, the Armenian government has been searching for a country to guarantee its independence, and has now come to us, bargaining for protection.\n\nThis request has led to some of the more expansionist voices within our government sensing an opportunity. They say that if we promise to treat the Armenian people well, [ARM.GetLeader] could probably be convinced of the idea of Armenia returning to Russian overlordship. Although he probably isn't too keen on surrendering Armenia's independence without a fight, he knows that we are more trustworthy than both the Turks and the Persians and would be wise to pick the lesser evil for his people, or else he might see them under the Turkish yoke again.\n\nHowever, others have argued that a de facto annexation of Armenia would be disadvantegous for our nation, and that it would be a better idea to force Armenia to become economically dependant on us. Surely, they wouldn't say no to some economic concessions and a few trade deals between our two nations favourable for the Russian side if this means securing the independence and sovereignty of [ARM.GetNameDef]."

Of course we could also try to survive on our own, but this might lead to the pointless death of thousands, and could potentially result in the utter annihilation of our beloved country. With us now being forced to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea, we should calculate our next move carefully, as it could very well seal the fate of our nation."

Some of our more ambitious politicians think that we should abuse this situation to the fullest, and advocate pressuring Armenia into becoming our puppet state in return for our protection. However, it is uncertain if the Armenians would accept this request, since it would effectively put an end to the independence they are trying to preserve. The safer option would probably be to demand the right to supervise their military.

Apparently, the rebuilding of diplomatic relations between our two countries is a step too far in the eyes of a large part of our population, for they feel that the Turks cannot be trusted. This has many reasons, which can mainly be found in the history the Turkish and the Armenian people share with each other. For centuries, the Armenian people were forced to live under Turkish rule, with every notion of resistance and nationalism being suppressed brutally. This culminated in the massacres of the Weltkrieg, which some of our people still remember vividly. For them, all Turks are to blame for these tragedies, even if the government to our west is no longer the one that suppressed our people for generations.\n\nToday, thousands took to the streets to officially protest against the already signed protection treaty, which for them is nothing but an outright betrayal of all the Armenian nation stands for. Luckily, the protests stayed peaceful thus far, and although their numbers are still growing larger by the hour, it doesn't seem like the protesters are about to turn to violence.

Especially the massacres of the Weltkrieg convinced many Armenians that staying in their homeland was a risk not worth taking, leading to them leaving their country and seeking their fortune elsewhere, far away from their Turkish oppressors.\n\nEver since our nation reentered the world stage, there has been a steady influx of Armenian immigrants from all around the world seeking to repopulate their homeland, which they formerly believed to be forever lost to the Turks. However, many hesitated to return to the land of their ancestors, mainly because of the ongoing conflict and the feeling that Armenia's independence was immensely threatened by its power-hungry and ambitious neighbours. Now though, with us having won the war of independence and our sovereignty being somewhat secured, these doubts have cleared up, and the number of immigrants has skyrocketed. Although these immigrants thus far mainly come from the Middle Eastern nations, and most of our fellow countrymen currently living in Europe and the Americas have decided not to abandon their lives there, it's still a good sight to see that our people are slowly beginning to return to their home."

In order to improve the research capabilities of our nation, they deem it necessary to not only expand the existing institutions, but also to sponsor new ones. More concretely, they plan on founding the National Academy of Sciences. This new academy, which would be located in our capital city of Yerevan, would mainly focus its research on both science and social sciences, and would thus greatly complement the already existing University of Yerevan, which focuses mostly on the fields of history, economics and culture.\n\nWhilst the majority of our government seems to be in favour of accepting this proposal, seeing as it would probably be a rather efficient way to fund talented Armenian scientists, not everyone has been convinced, and there are also some questioning whether or not this is a rational allocation of our resources."

He dreams of the academy becoming a centre of attention for scientists from all around the globe, of major breakthroughs in the various fields focused on by the academy, and of Armenian science being on par with that of the Western countries. This rather ambitious speech was met with the thunderous applause of all those attending the ceremony, including the press, the academics who are going to conduct their research in the new facilities, and even some government representatives.\n\nAlready, some scientists have begun the preparations for their first experiments in the new facility; Joseph Obeli and a few government officials have started negotiations about new funds which could be used to expand the academy even further; and news of the inauguration ceremony has spread throughout the country.

The goal of this endeavour is to create a language that is both easy to learn and to read. With this, the Council hopes to make the Armenian language more attractive to foreigners and to help solve Armenia's illiteracy problem.\n\nToday, the leaders of the Council presented our government with their proposed reform and requested for it to be both accepted and implemented throughout the country. Although it appears that they've tried to take a less radical approach at reforming the Armenian language, it is nevertheless to be expected that some of our people will be rather unhappy with the reform, seeing as it would replace the classical orthography, which many consider to be an important part of our culture. It is now up to us to decide what we value more: the opinion of some of our most educated citizens, or our time-honoured traditions."

arm.86.t:0 "Allegiance to the Wrong Banner"
arm.86.d:0 "In the midst of the night, our soldiers guarding our border with the Ottoman dogs all of a sudden noticed a number of lights approaching them from Turkish territory. Then, voices started growing louder, and our border guard naturally went on high alert, fearing the Turks might be conducting a surprise attack. However, just as our men were about to contact high command in order to receive new orders and to ask for reinforcements, the voices became audible enough to be understood. Unexpectedly, the approaching men spoke Armenian, and were now shouting at the border guards not to open fire on them. Since our soldiers remained sceptical, the strangers then laid down their arms as a show of good will, and one of them, with his hands high up in the air, slowly approached the border.\n\nAfter being searched thoroughly to check whether he posed a threat, he proceeded to explain what was currently happening. Apparently, he himself is none other than Boghos Bey Dadian, a famous Ottoman colonel of Armenian descent. He and the formerly Ottoman soldiers following his lead, who are also Armenians, deserted shortly after our rebellion began, unwilling to fight for an Empire actively suppressing their very own countrymen. Together, they organised a plan to cross the border and to take as much military equipment as they possibly could with them - and now they were here.\n\nUpon hearing this story and after ensuring that what they were told was true, the border guard let the men enter our country, and by now most of them have already enlisted in our armed forces, ready to partake in the fight for the liberty of Armenia and her people. As for Boghos Bey, he has found his way to the capital, where he has been promoted to the rank of general by the high command, so that the experience he has gathered in years of service under the Ottoman flag may be put to good use."
arm.86.a:0 "They will make a fine addition to our armed forces."
 
arm.87.t:0 "The Liberation of Kars"
arm.87.d:0 "In mere weeks, we have managed to breach the puny Ottoman defences, and now, the advance of our valiant soldiers has reached the mountains and highlands of Kars, which have in turn been freed from the grasp of their Turkish overlords. This comes as a great victory to our people, as the region has strong historic ties to the Armenian nation. A millennium ago, under the reign of the Bagratuni dynasty, the city of Kars served as the capital of the Kingdom of Armenia, and although Kars was conquered by several outside powers since its foundation, including the Seljuk and Ottoman Turks, the region continued to be inhabited predominantly by Armenians - until the Weltkrieg turned the tides of history.\n\nServing as one of the main battlefields between the Russian and Ottoman forces during the conflict, the region was harmed greatly by the war, and its population was not spared by the horrors Ottoman troops inflicted upon those of Armenian descent. A large part of the survivors migrated to the newly established Vilayet of Armenia after the war, making the few that chose to stay behind a minority in their own home.\n\nNow, however, with us having liberated Kars, it seems that a new age of Armenian rule over the region is upon us. Following our advance, an increasing number of locals has revealed that they, in fact, identify as ethnic Armenians, but have been hiding their true identity out of fear of being persecuted by the Turks, with some even taking up arms and joining our army in the fight against their former oppressors. These fresh recruits, in addition to a number of arms plundered from the local arsenal, will aid our war effort considerably, and with Ottoman troops thus far unable to halt our advance, the dream of an independent Armenian state is slowly becoming reality."

Despite being a hyperpolyglot and a successful bank executive, Keresteciyan is also notorious in Armenia for his friendship with Mustafa Kemal and his support for Turkish Nationalism.\nCausign a lot of bewilderment and even anxiety among the common Armenian population, This strange appointment caused spontaneous protests in Yerevan, which, however, were soon suppressed by the army.\nWill Keresteciyan continue Karabekir's reforms or introduce Kemalist principles is yet unknown."

Similar to Berlin, the Porte is on high alert for any changes to the situation as they watch the economy collapse into the ground. Nonetheless there is far less of a crisis in the Empire than many initially expected, as the protectionist nature of the empire during the '20s has formed the foundation of a structure capable of resisting most shocks on the global market.\n\nTo ensure the fears of the private sector are quelled, and to outline the next Four Year Plan envisioned by the OHFs economic partners, a second Economic Congress was held in the city of Samsun on the Black Sea.\nTo our great dissatisfaction, the Vilayet of Erivan has to face overall more severe consequences.

However, now that Armenian terrorism is gaining momentum again, the center has received a proposal to increase the punishment. In case of detection of a connection with the ARF, a sentence of up to 15 years in prison is proposed. Such a measure will have to scare the hapless Armenians away from these vile terrorists."

After walking through the valleys and mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh for several days, the bloodhounds did not find not only Nzhdeh, but also any traces of the presence of Armenian terrorists in general. Tired and exhausted, they came back without much slurping. \n\nTrying to find out why Nzhdeh remained elusive again, the Ottoman garrison found the old man's hut in order to interrogate him about his malicious crime - obviously false testimony, but there was no one inside. Moreover, local Armenians living in the neighborhood said that the hut has been empty for 20 years..."

Now, Azerbaijani militia forces have entered the city, which have engaged in a fight with local residents. At that moment, armed people suddenly appeared in the city - namely, Armenian nationalists. The shooting began, in which our Azerbaijani brothers fell victims... Soon, rumors about the return of Nzhdeh appeared in the city - with his head covered and in a military uniform, he allegedly broadcast from the rostrum about the return of Nagorno-Karabakh under Armenian control and called on Armenians to unite for the sake of saving their people."

Recapturing district after district, we managed to push the Armenian terrorists closer and closer to the border with [PER.GetName]. \n\nHowever, there was no Nzhdeh among them. Or, at the very least, it was not possible to identify him. However, we took advantage of this by starting to spread rumors that the vaunted Armenian hero is just a pathetic coward who hid behind the backs of his thugs. Hoping to provoke Nzhdeh, we tried to lure him out.\n\nHowever, very soon, when the remnants of the Armenian terrorists were already very close to the border, they stopped all resistance and retreated.

arm.211.d:0 "Before the outbreak of World War I, Karabekir served in Constantinople and was then sent to some European countries like Austria-Hungary, Germany, France and Switzerland. In July 1914, he returned home, as a world war was likely. Back in Constantinople, Karabekir was assigned the chief of intelligence at the General Staff. Soon, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. After a short time on the southeastern front, he was sent to the Dardanelles. As commander of the 14th Division, Karabekir fought in the Battle of Gallipoli in the summer of 1915. In October 1915, he was appointed chief staff officer at the First Army in Istanbul. He was commissioned to the Iraqi front to join the Sixth Army. For his success at Gallipoli, he was decorated in December 1915 by both the Ottoman and the German Commands and was contemporaneously promoted to colonel. In April 1916, he took over the command of the 18th Corps, which gained a great victory over the British forces led by General Charles Townshend during the Siege of Kut-al Amara in Iraq. Karabekir was appointed commander of the 2nd Corps on the Caucasian front and fought bitterly against the Russian and Armenian forces for almost ten months. In September 1917, he was promoted to brigadier general by a decree of the Sultan. During the later part of the Great War Karabekir served in the \"Eastern Front\" in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nKarabekir joined the OPP, collaborating with Minister of War Mustafa Kemal, his personal ally and friend. However, despite his collaboration with Mustafa Kemal he disagreed with his old friend on certain aspects of his controversial Reforms. Later, the authoritarian style of the Grand Vizier lead to a splintering of the party - when his former ally and friend Kâzım Karabekir broke with the party to create his own party, the “ODF” or “Ottoman Defence Party” (later the Democratic Party, DF), and joining the Chamber of Deputies. The Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralisation under its leader Haqqi al-Azm became the grand winner of the elections, and formed a coalition with the FAP and the ODF to provide a united front against the growing centralist threat. The liberal coalition, however, was under constant attack, as the various parties that played part in it had conflicting opinions on a non-OPP policy. Tensions reached a breaking point in late 1932, when the government of Haqqi al-Azm collapsed due to disagreement with the FAP and ODF."

arm.212.d:0 "When in 1935 Karabekir was appointed Vali Erivan, at first it caused shocks and clashes. The Armenians remembered well the general who fought against them in the Weltkrieg.\n\nHowever, Karabekir personally was not particularly concerned about the "Armenian issue". For the sake of suppressing the riots, he allowed the assembly of Armenians, and even allowed the creation of local self-government bodies in villages. Basically, Vali was focused on military issues, since the Erivan garrison was directly subordinate to him. \n\nThe second year of Karabekir's rule of Armenia will soon begin, and it seems that there is still hope for liberalization. With the growing popularity of progressive parties in the Empire, he is ready to experiment with reforms in the Vilayet, and if successful, he may be able to change public opinion in his favor in other parts of the empire."

As the leader of the Democratic Party of the Empire, he can start reforms now - in the Vilayet under his control. His plans include increasing the autonomy of the local Armenian population, but this does not mean easing on a number of issues, in particular, lifting the ban on Armenian parties. \n\nTo a greater extent, Vali is interested in economic reforms - economic liberalization, land privatization and attracting foreign investors to a province on the outskirts of the empire - a once-in-a-lifetime chance."

After joining the Dashnaktsutyun in 1908 and participating in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, he fought the Turks in Bulgaria during the Balkan Wars and was even awarded the Cross of Bravery for his competence in battle.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he once again fought against the Ottoman Empire, this time under Russian flag. As the Russians retreated in 1917, Nzhdeh began organising paramilitaries, hoping to be able to halt the Ottoman advance into Armenia. However, his efforts eventually proved to be in vain, and as Armenia was partitioned during the Caucasus Conference in 1919, he saw himself forced to concede Armenia proper to the Turks and to flee into Karabakh, a region which was de jure under the control of Azerbaijan. There, he continued to organise Armenian rebel forces, hoping that he would one day get a chance to return to Yerevan and to bring the Armenian people their freedom.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Desert War, this day had finally come, and as he returned from his exile, he was hailed as a hero by the people. With their support, he has now taken power, hoping that he'll be able to lead his people into a future free from foreign oppression and to save the newborn Armenian nation from experiencing the same fate as the First Armenian Republic."

POLITICS_KAZIM_KARABEKIR_DESC:0 "One might wonder what Kazim Karabekir, one of the most influential politicians in the Empire as the undisputed leader of the liberal 'Democratic Party', and a general respected for his services during the Great War and the Balkan Wars, is doing here in Erivan as Governor.\n\nHe was assigned to this position in 1935 by Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha in order to distance him from the central government in Constantinople where the OHF was concentrating more and more power. Karabekir is not discouraged by this and intend to use his position as Governor of the Erivan Vilayet to implement the policies he want to see applied to the whole Empire. He is not particularly interested in the Armenian people, but he understood that to attempt a Turkification by force without a second thought would only increase the chances of rebellion and revolt by the local population. This is why he promotes generally softer policies than in the past, such as the development of education or a closer rapprochement with the Armenians who are willing to collaborate, while giving no quarter to dangerous terrorists such as Nzhdeh." 

POLITICS_BERC_KERESTIYAN_DESC:0 "A traitor to most native Armenians and an example of the model Armenian to the Turks, Berç 'Türker' Keresteciyan is undoubtedly a divisive figure.\n\nBorn in Constantinople into a wealthy Armenian family, Keresteciyan was destined for a good future from birth, becoming a banker by profession and rising to the position of general manager of the Ottoman Bank, where his expertise was key to the victory in the Weltkrieg. After the war, he became fast friends with Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal and soon joined the OHF, becoming one of its most important cadres, even earning the nickname 'Türker' meaning 'the valiant Turk'. He has served as a deputy for the OHF ever since and was most recently made Governor of Erivan following the Liberal Cooalition's takeover, in an attempt to appease the Armenian population by appointing an Armenian to this post, but more importantly to keep this notorious OHF leader as far away from central power as possible.\n\nKeresteciyan is the first Armenian to be appointed Vali of the Vilayet of Erivan, but he intend to pursue a much tougher policy than his predecessor Karabekir, planning for an intensification of Turkification and aggressive modernization along the lines of the Kemalist theses, which unfortunately could not be applied to the rest of the Empire. An uncertain sun now rises on Armenia while the nationalist movements intensify day by day..."

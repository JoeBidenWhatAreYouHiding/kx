AOG_gw_tank_equipment_desc: "The Sturmpanzerwagen A7V is a German tank which was used extensively during the Weltkrieg, and is often seen depicted in works of art celebrating the German victory over the Entente. However, its design has since become obsolete and Germany has come to use newer, more complicated tank designs."
AOG_light_tank_equipment_1: "Sturmpanzerwagen M.I 'Kätzchen'"
AOG_light_tank_equipment_1_short: "Kätzchen"
AOG_light_tank_equipment_1_desc: "The Panzer I is a light tank armed only with two light machine guns. Design of the Panzer I began in 1932, originally with the purpose of creating a standard training tank, but short before mass production began in 1934, its role and design was revised and then tank was adopted by the Army for combat."
AOG_light_tank_equipment_2: "Sturmpanzerwagen M.II 'Ozelot'"
AOG_light_tank_equipment_2_short: "Ozelot"
AOG_light_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The Panzer II, while based upon the chassis of the Panzer I, is drastically different from its predecessor. Feature much heavier armaments, armor, engine, and an entirely revamped transmission system, the Panzer II, while it can certainly go toe to toe with comparable vehicles, was originally designed as a stopgap while larger, more advanced tanks were to be developed, but the vehicles capable performance secured it a place in the German war machine."

AOG_light_tank_equipment_3_short: "Leopard"
AOG_light_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The VK1602 Leopard was planned as a forward reconnaissance vehicle armed with a 75mm Kwk 41 gun. As the design progressed, however, the gun was replaced with a smaller 50mm cannon with greater armor penetration and unlike older German designs, featured sloped frontal armour and extra-wide all-terrain tracks. The Leopard now fills a unique combat roll, both as a capable support and reconnaissance vehicle."

Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."

AOG_battle_cruiser_2: "O Class"
#AOG_battle_cruiser_2_desc: "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers.

AOG_battleship_2: "Scharnhorst Class"
#AOG_battleship_2_desc: "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
AOG_battleship_3: "Bismarck Class"
#AOG_battleship_3_desc: "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15") guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
AOG_battleship_4: "Hindenburg Class"
#AOG_battleship_4_desc: "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16") guns."
AOG_carrier_1: "Flugzeugdampfer I"
#AOG_carrier_1_desc: "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Airplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
AOG_carrier_2: "Seydlitz Class"
#AOG_carrier_2_desc: "Seydlitz was laid down as the fourth ship of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers. Partially completed by the beginning of the war, she was considered for conversion into an aircraft carrier. The project, codenamed Weser 1, was partially underway when work was halted due to increasing air attacks on Bremen and the lack of resources for her construction."
AOG_carrier_3: "Graf Zeppelin Class"
#AOG_carrier_3_desc: "Graf Zeppelin was the only class of ships in the Kriegsmarine that had been designed as an aircraft carrier from the keel up. Two ships were ordered, but neither was completed. As designed, the Graf Zeppelin would carry 30 Bf-109T fighters and 12 Ju-87E dive bombers, ship versions of the Bf-109E and the Ju-87D."
AOG_carrier_4: "Europa Class"
#AOG_carrier_4_desc: "Several civilian ships were considered for conversions to aircraft carriers by the Kriegsmarine in the 1940s. The largest of these ships was the passenger ship Europa. Being the largest passenger ship in Germany, she had been used as a barracks ship and a troop transport before work began on converting her to a carrier. Had she been completed, she would have displaced 56,000 tons and carried an air group of 42 aircraft."
AOG_SH_battleship_1: "Schlachtschiff H41"
#AOG_SH_battleship_1_desc: "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armour, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
AOG_SH_battleship_2: "Schlachtschiff H44"
#AOG_SH_battleship_2_desc: "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs.

AOG_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Ar 576 'Hammer'"
AOG_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Seeing Germany's need for a jet-powered intercontinental bomber, Arado Aviationworks set out to develop an upscaled version of their experimental jet tactical bomber, the Ar 234. The Ar 576 feautres a unique engine design whereby all four jet engines are inlaid in the wing of the aircraft; it was the jarring sound these engines make when spinning up, a sound like that of a hammer being slammed against the fuselage, that the Ar 576 earned the nickname 'hammer' among German test pilots."

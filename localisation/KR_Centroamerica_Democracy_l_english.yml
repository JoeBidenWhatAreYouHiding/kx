### EVENTS ###
cendem.1.t:0 "The Confederacy is Born!"
cendem.1.d:0 "With the traitors dealt with and Central America held by our forces, we can now safely proclaim the Confederation of Central America. The dream of our nations unified under a democracy formed from each member nation is now no longer a remnant of the past. However, there is still a long way to go. As our territorial extension has grown significantly, our government has decided to delegate the executive power of the newly formed nation to the Central American Constitutional Convention until the new parties reorganize to take into account the newly acquired territories, and will decide upon the fate of the Central American Confederation once the parties with most members present themselves in the convention."
cendem.1.a:0 "Long Live the Confederation!"

cendem.2.t:0 "Formation of the Partido Unionista"
cendem.2.d:0 "The Partido Unionista, born out of the many parties in Central America who wanted the unification of the continent, has held its first meeting in Ciudad de Guatemala. Having prepared for the unification of Central America for years, they have been the first party to present itself to the convention, and has taken over power temporarily until the other parties organize and the convention regarding the direction the country should take is held.\n\nPresided by the Guatemalan politician José Perfecto Azmitia González, the Unionist Party follows a conservative mindset and has already stated in their manifesto that their objective is to carry the Confederation to a more usual form of Republic and to create a Central American identity, that encompasses all the cultures within Central America. They also reject the intervention of foreigners in national affairs, and this might spell the end of the UFC influence in the country..."
cendem.2.a:0 "The First of many parties, hopefully."

cendem.3.t:0 "Formation of the Partido Unificacion Democratica"
cendem.3.d:0 "The Partido de Unificación Democratica has held it's first meeting as an official party of the Confederation. The meeting, held in the Honduran city of Tegucigalpa, has united the many free-market liberals that feel antagonized by the autarkical proposals of Sacasa, and have released a manifesto regarding the policies they are willing to pursue. Among them, cooperation with foreign companies like the UFC and to open Central American trade to the world. However, they claim they don't want to rely on any specific foreign power, as they see this as one of the reasons why Central America was thrown into chaos when the United States fell into the fires of Civil War.\n\nUnfortunately, not all issues have been solved during the meeting, as a faction lead by the Honduran undisputed face of liberalism, Juan Manuel Gálvez, faces off opposition from a faction lead by the Nicaraguan José María Moncada. In order to solve to proclaim a party leader, the Democratic Unification Party has decided to call for an internal election amongst affiliates, and the winner will lead the party in the upcoming elections."
cendem.3.a:0 "Juan Manuel Gálvez stays as the solid popular choice."
cendem.3.b:0 "Jose Maria Moncada comes ahead in the party polls!"

cendem.4.t:0 "Formation of the Partido Liberal"
cendem.4.d:0 "As the political landscape of the Central American Confederation is starting to take shape, another party has surfaced to challenge the Unionistas in the next election. The Partido Liberal has been officially founded in Managua, with the old Nicaraguan liberal Juan Bautista Sacasa on it's head, has become an official party of the Confederation. The Liberals, promising economic independence for Central America and to move away from the old agricultural export-based economy towards an industrial based one. Despite this premise, they have stated that they are more than willing to cooperate with foreign companies in order to achieve this goal, which has eased unrest amongst foreign investors, particularly from the United Fruit Company that feared that their assets might be seized."
cendem.4.a:0 "The flame of Liberalism continues to burn in Central America!"

cendem.5.t:0 "Formation of the Partido del Trabajo"
cendem.5.d:0 "As parties with grand ambitions like the Liberales or the Unionistas start their political campaign, the Partido del Trabajo has been formed in San Salvador, the many centre-left politicians and thinkers that, while agreeing in many aspects with the other parties, are more focused on helping the struggling peasants in Central America than in grand ambitions of prosperity. Amongst the many changes that the Labour Party wants to bring about to the confederation is the establishment of some form of welfare state, a land reform and the creation of a middle class, which is nearly non-existent in our country.\n\nHowever, despite bringing together many parties from different countries, it is unclear who shall lead the party during the elections, as orthodox social democracy, represented by the faction lead by , clashes with many who follow Arturo Araujo's 'Vitalismo', a variant of Social Democracy created by the Salvadorian politician Alberto Masferrer. Elections for party affiliates have been called and the winner will represent the party in the convention and during the next elections."
cendem.5.a:0 "Araujo is chosen to spread Vitalismo in the Confederation."
cendem.5.b:0 "Morales is chosen to broaden Progressivism in the Confederation."

cendem.6.t:0 "The Constitutional Convention Starts"
cendem.6.d:0 "Without a recognized central authority, managing to arrange a constitutional convention between representatives of all the newly founded parties has been difficult. No consensus could be made over which city should the convention be held, so the city of San Salvador was eventually chosen as it's geographic location was near the centre of the Confederation, the city had the infrastructure to held large scale political demonstrations and it was also the symbolical place for Central American independence, as it was the place where the Primer Grito de la Independencia came to be. As the delegations arrive, proposals come forth regarding what the Confederation should look like in the near future, and the convention members have the duty to decide what shall be the future of the country."
cendem.6.a:0 "We welcome you all."

cendem.7.t:0 "Debate on the Fate of Our Enemies"
cendem.7.d:0 "Before the convention decides on any matter regarding the constitution, it has been deemed wise by the Unionistas to start the constitutional convention by discussing what will be done with the radicals that set out to destroy democracy in Central America. While it is clear that the death penalty is out of the question by all members of the convention, they still need to decide on a fitting punishment for the radicals. The PUD has proposed to exile the leaders and any who doesn't recognize the Federal government as legitimate, which is seen as the most lenient solution, but one that lets many criminals just walk freely. The Unionistas simply propose to imprison them for the rest of their life, which, while being a rather simple solution, could pose danger for our nation in case of a breakout. The Partido del Trabajo, on the other hand, has offered a proposal where the criminals can be imprisoned, but they can choose to work in improvised construction squads, which shall be vital during the reconstruction and improvement of our country, in exchange for reduced sentence times. Before the Convention moves forward, this matter will have to be settled, for the sake of the short term stability of our nation."
cendem.7.a:0 "The proposal by the Partido de Unificación Democratica is the right one."
cendem.7.b:0 "The Unionistas have a point, these criminals must not walk freely!"
cendem.7.c:0 "The criminals should be allowed to earn their forgiveness!"

cendem.8.t:0 "Executive Power Debate: The Power of the President"
cendem.8.d:0 "One of the major concerns brought up, specially by the Salvadorian PT delegation, is how giving too much power to the president might be detrimental to the confederation in the long run, and so it should have it's power reduced to have the congress be able to overturn a presidential decision on a two thirds majority, and they argue that it would otherwise open up the chance of an authoritarian regime rising. However, Unionistas argue that a strong executive power is needed to held the confederation in place, as the ineffective rule of the previous Confederation was what led to its eventual dissolution. After several days of debate, the convention members are once again ready to vote on the matter."
cendem.8.a:0 "The President will have absolute veto power."
cendem.8.b:0 "The Congress will be able to overturn a veto with a two thirds majority."

cendem.9.t:0 "On the Subject of Constitutional Supremacy"
cendem.9.d:0 "As the national constitution is starting to take shape, we have to decide on the role this document will take on our union. While the convention could install a constitutional supremacy clause in the document, rendering all local legislation useless if it contradicts the constitution, the Partido del Trabajo representatives argue that it would reduce the provincial autonomy to a dangerous level while empowering the Federal Government. Instead, they propose to use the constitution as a guideline for the local legislations, which shall operate freely as long as they respect some core tenets of the Federal Constitution. What should the convention choose?"
cendem.9.a:0 "The Constitution should take precedence over any pesky provincial law."
cendem.9.b:0 "The Constitution should serve as a guideline for the local legislations."

cendem.10.t:0 "Centralize the Capital?"
cendem.10.d:0 "One of the main issues brought forth by the Liberals is that a confederation should try to keep its members on equal footing, and with the convention about to choose a definitive capital for the nation, they have put forth a proposal to split the three powers of the republic to different cities in order to symbolically decentralize the nation. Should the convention members consider their proposition?"
cendem.10.a:0 "No, Centralize the Confederation."
cendem.10.b:0 "Yes, Split the powers to different cities."

cendem.11.t:0 "Choosing a Capital"
cendem.11.d:0 "After the rejection of the liberal proposal, it is now time to decide which city shall be the capital of our newly born nation. Among our choices are the old Guatemalan capital of Ciudad de Guatemala, which was the birthplace of the first confederation; San Salvador, the place where the First Cry of Independence took place more than a hundred years ago; Tegucigalpa, the original capital of the Central American republic back in 1880; and Managua, the old capital of Nicaragua and one of the greatest cities in Central America. As the convention members retire from the presidential house of San Salvador to rest until the next round of talks, the radio announces that the new capital is..."
cendem.11.a:0 "Ciudad de Guatemala."
cendem.11.b:0 "San Salvador."
cendem.11.c:0 "Tegucigalpa."
cendem.11.e:0 "Managua."

cendem.12.t:0 "Choosing an Executive Capital"
cendem.12.d:0 "After the acceptance of the liberal proposal, it is now time to decide which city shall be the executive capital of our newly born nation. Among our choices are the old Guatemalan capital of Ciudad de Guatemala, which was the birthplace of the first confederation; San Salvador, the place where the First Cry of Independence took place more than a hundred years ago; Tegucigalpa, the original capital of the Central American republic back in 1880; and Managua, the old capital of Nicaragua and one of the greatest cities in Central America. As the convention members retire from the presidential house of San Salvador to rest until the next round of talks, the radio announces that the new executive capital is..."
cendem.12.a:0 "Ciudad de Guatemala."
cendem.12.b:0 "San Salvador."
cendem.12.c:0 "Tegucigalpa."
cendem.12.e:0 "Managua."

cendem.13.t:0 "Choosing a Judicial Capital"
cendem.13.d:0 "With the executive capital chosen, the convention now has to choose a judicial capital, which shall be the place where the supreme court will be placed."
cendem.13.a:0 "Ciudad de Guatemala."
cendem.13.b:0 "San Salvador."
cendem.13.c:0 "Tegucigalpa."
cendem.13.e:0 "Managua."

cendem.14.t:0 "Choosing a Legislative Capital"
cendem.14.d:0 "After the Executive and Judicial capital cities have been chosen, we now have to decide which city shall have the Senate and most of the legislative body will be placed."
cendem.14.a:0 "Ciudad de Guatemala."
cendem.14.b:0 "San Salvador."
cendem.14.c:0 "Tegucigalpa."
cendem.14.e:0 "Managua."

cendem.15.t:0 "Status of the Armed forces"
cendem.15.d:0 "After the defeat of the many military reactionary elements that once kept our citizens under their boot, we now have to decide what to do on the force that once gave them the power to end what once were free nations. It is recognized by all parties that a national security force is needed in order to secure our sovereignty, but each party has a different approach towards the armed forces. The Unionistas have proposed a Federal Army, subordinated to the Federal executive power and with a section under the direct control of the President, which would try to strive for professionalism and superior tactics where it was possible. The Partido del Trabajo has come up with a different proposal, aiming to create regional army structures, similar to those from before our nation was formed, they propose a confederation with individual armies which would come together in case of war, but would otherwise have very little executive power and be subjected to each province's executive power rather than the federal government. The Partido Unificación Demócratica has offered a middle ground, with a federal army backed by regional militias, similar to the system that Brazil has with their army. Once again, the convention members will take a vote in order to decide the future of our armed forces."
cendem.15.a:0 "A Confederate Army with limited power is chosen as the best option."
cendem.15.b:0 "Compromise is an art as old as politics, and it proves successful once more."
cendem.15.c:0 "A Federal Army will secure Central American interests once more."

cendem.16.t:0 "Provisional Cabinet Formation"
cendem.16.d:0 "One of the final steps of the convention is to designate a provisional cabinet until a proper election can be made in the near future."
cendem.16.a:0 "It is a temporary solution that pleases everyone."

cendem.17.t:0 "Provisional Head of State"
cendem.17.d:0 "The last decision by the Council will be to designate a provisional president until the first election can be made. All the parties have put forth their representatives to fill the role until popular will can decide who will lead the country. While a the provisional president is chosen by the convention, the elections have already been officially scheduled to happen in three months, giving the provisional representatives enough time to ensure the availability of voting booths and ballots throughout the country."
cendem.17.a:0 "The Partido del Trabajo will lead temporarily."
cendem.17.b:0 "The Partido Liberal will lead temporarily."
cendem.17.c:0 "The Partido Unificación Democrática will lead temporarily."
cendem.17.e:0 "The Partido Unionista will lead temporarily."
cendem.17.f:0 "The Partido Nacional Revolucionario will lead temporarily."

cendem.18.t:0 "Formation of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario"
cendem.18.d:0 "Born from the ashes of what remained of several socialist movements in Central America, the Partido Nacional Revolucionario has formed today in Quetzaltenango. Lead by the Guatemalan Mario Méndez Montenegro, the party is a rather moderate variant of socialism compared to old school socialists like Sandino or Martí, who have been banned explicitly by the other parties from the elections. The party has been forced to take an oath to the other parties as to not associate with the radicals who once plunged Central America into chaos in order to allow their participation in politics. Their platform of land reform, welfare for the working class and better rights for natives has attracted unexpected support and despite the defeat of socialism in Central America, they PNR might still become a relevant force in the Confederation."
cendem.18.a:0 "Only time will tell if they'll be a strong as they once were."

cendem.19.t:0 "The [GetYear] Central American Snap Election"
cendem.19.d:0 "As the ballots are prepared in every city and town within our nation, our citizens wonder who shall be the party that shall lead the nation for the next four years. As the day nears it's end, the ballots are counted and the result is..."
cendem.19.a:0 "The PT gains the popular vote!"
cendem.19.b:0 "The PL comes out victorious!"
cendem.19.c:0 "The PUD takes the win!"
cendem.19.e:0 "The PU wins by a landslide!"
cendem.19.f:0 "The PNR makes a comeback!"

cendem.30.t:0 "Internal Elections of the Partido del Trabajo"
cendem.30.d:0 "After many years of near hegemony in the ruling party, both Moreno and Morales have been relegated to secondary party work as the popularity of the two Guatemalans Arevalo and Arbenz skyrockets within the party. Both offering a unique take on the party's policies, they don't seem to agree on a common ground for the future. It is because of this that an election has been called to decide who shall lead the Partido del Trabajo for the years to come."
cendem.30.a:0 "Jacobo Arbenz."
cendem.30.b:0 "Juan Jose Arévalo."

cendem.31.t:0 "Internal Elections of the Partido Liberal"
cendem.31.d:0 "During the recent years, as liberalism has spread in the Central American nation, Sacasa's nearly unchallenged hegemony within the Partido Liberal is nearing its end. The recent polls had been indicating an ascendance in popularity of the Salvadorian Pio Romero Bosque, a controverted figure in Central America since he had been responsible for helping in manipulating elections for the Molina political dynasty. However, he has been cleaning up his name for years, and his promises are slowly swaying the liberals away from Sacasa. Calls for an internal election within the party have been plenty in the recent time, and Sacasa has complied with the demands. Now the internal election shall decide who will lead the Liberals for the near future."
cendem.31.a:0 "Sacasa retains his position as leader."
cendem.31.b:0 "Bosque takes a surprise victory!"

cendem.32.t:0 "Internal Elections of the Partido del Trabajo"
cendem.32.d:0 "Excusing himself about his old age and overall exhaustion of politics, Arturo Araujo has decided to step down as the leader of the Partido del Trabajo in order to retire permanently from public life. As one of the last original Vitalistas leaves the public life, the party has called for an internal election in order to decide who shall be the new party leader from now on. While Francisco Sequeira Moreno is still a relevant figure within the party, the young Honduran medic Ramon Villeda Morales has become more and more relevant within the party to the point of being a prime candidate for the election. As the party counts the ballots of the internal election, the results are..."
cendem.32.a:0 "Ramon Villeda Morales takes a surprise victory and succeeds Araujo in the party."
cendem.32.b:0 "Francisco Sequeira Moreno is rewarded for his patience and succeeds Araujo in the party."

cendem.33.t:0 "The Death of Sacassa and the Aftermath in the Partido Liberal"
cendem.33.d:0 "Tragedy has struck the liberal party as Juan Bautista Sacasa has passed away in Managua. With his death, the Liberal party is thrown into chaos as there wasn't any specific leader that could take over after Sacasa's death. The party has called for a new internal election that shall chose the new face of the Liberal party for the years to come and who shall honour the legacy of Sacasa and the many liberal thinkers before him."
cendem.33.a:0 "Abelardo Cuadra takes a surprise victory."
cendem.33.b:0 "Bosque becomes the new leader of the party."

cendem.34.t:0 "Jacobo Arbenz Becomes the Leader of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario"
cendem.34.d:0 "After being defeated in the PT's elections, Jacobo Arbenz met José Manuel Fortuny, a young socialist who had been impressed by Arbenz's proposals in the Partido del Trabajo. As both became close friends, 'Che Manuel' offered Arbenz to join the Partido Nacional Revolucionario, where, despite not sharing the overall socialist ideals most members of the PNR have, he has gained an immense amount of popularity and respect due to his compromising nature and concern for the welfare of the citizens throughout Central America. With the PNR's elections taking place, Jacobo Arbenz has won the popular vote by a large majority, and will become the new leader of the party for the next elections."
cendem.34.a:0 "Was the PNR moved further right? or Arbenz further left?"

cendem.35.t:0 "The Death of Bosque"
cendem.35.d:0 "Pio Romero Bosque has passed away in his homestead in San Salvador, he is now mourned by many liberals throughout the country. With a lack of solid candidates to challenge him, it seems that Abelardo Cuadra has become the only candidate and de-facto leader of the Liberal Party."
cendem.35.a:0 "Abelardo Cuadra will lead the Liberals to victory!"

cendem.36.t:0 "The Death of Azmitia"
cendem.36.d:0 "Azmitia González has passed away, victim of a sudden cardiac arrest. His mortal remains are being the object of numerous tributes by the Partido Unionista and the many citizens of our nation who wanted reunification before our nations were finally one once again. He will now be buried in the General Cemetery of Guatemala City under the flag of Unionism, but his death is not the end of the Unionistas. They have called for a new internal election to designate a successor for Azmitia and the two main candidates, Guatemalan Julio Domingo Bianchi Smout and Nicaraguan Emiliano Chamorro Vargas, have already presented their proposals for the future of the party. While Bianchi wants to continue the legacy of Azmitia, Chamorro wants to reform the Unionistas into a more traditional conservative party, and it is time for the party members to decide what shall be the future of the Partido Unionista."
cendem.36.a:0 "Bianchi wins and successfully succeeds his predecessor."
cendem.36.b:0 "Chamorro wins the elections and will reform the party."

cendem.37.t:0 "Partido del Trabajo Protests!"
cendem.37.d:0 "After the restoration of the military as a symbol of pride for Central America, the Partido del Trabajo has protested publicly, calling for people to rally against this display of what they call a 'Stepping stone towards a new autocracy'. While their insults hardly hurt our position, many people who feel afraid that the military might take the same anti-democratic decisions that they had taken in the recent years have been drawn into the Partido del Trabajo in order to fight off this influence."
cendem.37.a:0 "Our Army needs to improve its Image."

cendem.38.t:0 "Request for Costa Rican Integration"
cendem.38.d:0 "Now that we stand safe in power, with our institutions backing our government and our economy humming along, the time has come to reclaim an old member of the original Federal Republic of Central America: Costa Rica. While the incorporation has sparked strong clashes in the congress, specially between the PUD and PNR representatives, we've reached an agreement and we will ask them to integrate to our territory peacefully. We have drafted a proposal and we'll send it with a delegation, which hopefully shall be taken into consideration by the Costa Rican government."
cendem.38.a:0 "Let's hope they see things our way."

cendem.39.t:0 "Central America Requests Our Integration"
cendem.39.d:0 "A delegation of the Central American Nation has arrived today at San Jose with the intention of negotiating the integration of our country into their confederation. While this has sparked mixed reactions amongst our populace, it falls to us to decide what we shall do regarding unification with our former brothers."
cendem.39.a:0 "Agree to their proposal and start working on unification measures."
cendem.39.b:0 "Agree to their proposal but demand autonomy within the union."
cendem.39.c:0 "Refuse their proposal."

cendem.40.t:0 "Costa Rica Accepts Integration"
cendem.40.d:0 "The Costa Rican government has agreed to be integrated into our nation once more. As the red, blue and white banner flies for the last time in Costa Rica, the people rejoice at the final member of the original Federation re-joining our nation as equals."
cendem.40.a:0 "It is a historic day for Central America!"

cendem.41.t:0 "Costa Rica Asks to Remain Autonomous within the Union"
cendem.41.d:0 "Our delegation in Costa Rica has informed us that the Costa Ricans are interested in joining the Central American nation. However, they ask to be given a greater autonomy than the one we've given the other members of the confederation to the point that we would hardly have any executive power over them. What should be our response?"
cendem.41.a:0 "We accept their Terms."
cendem.41.b:0 "Recall the Delegation. We will solve this by force!"

cendem.42.t:0 "Costa Rica Refuses to Join!"
cendem.42.d:0 "The Costa Rican government have turned down our offer and refuse to join our nation. While many hot-headed politicians in the Unionista party are calling for war in order to solve this situation, the other parties find this solution completely abhorrent and ask for Costa Rica to be left alone. However, this may be the last chance we get to unify all the old Federal Republic of Central America members, and we ought to weight our options carefully."
cendem.42.a:0 "Kindly accept their decision and try to keep friendly relations."
cendem.42.b:0 "Recall the Delegation. We will solve this by force!"

cendem.43.t:0 "Central America Accepts Our Request"
cendem.43.d:0 "Our Central American brothers have accepted the terms of our agreement, and we're now making the move to complete our integration into their nation."
cendem.43.a:0 "Magnifico!"

cendem.44.t:0 "Costa Rica Joins Central America!"
cendem.44.d:0 "The Nation of Costa Rica has decided to join the Central American nation and has managed to break free from our control! We have no other choice than to let them go in order to keep good relations with the Central American nation."

cendem.45.t:0 "Request for Panamanean Integration"
cendem.45.d:0 "Now that we stand safe in power, with our institutions backing our government and our economy humming along, the time has come to reclaim a forgotten member of our continent who nearly entered the original Federal Republic of Central America: Panama. While the incorporation has sparked strong clashes in the congress, specially between the PUD and PNR representatives, we've reached an agreement and we will ask them to integrate to our territory peacefully. We have drafted a proposal and we'll send it with a delegation, which hopefully shall be taken into consideration by the Panamanean government."
cendem.45.a:0 "Let's hope they see things our way."

cendem.46.t:0 "Central America Requests Our Integration"
cendem.46.d:0 "A delegation of the Central American Nation has arrived today at Ciudad de Panama with the intention of negotiating the integration of our country into their confederation. While this has sparked mixed reactions amongst our populace, it falls to us to decide what we shall do regarding unification with our would-be brothers."
cendem.46.a:0 "Agree to their proposal and start working on unification measures."
cendem.46.b:0 "Agree to their proposal but demand autonomy within the union."
cendem.46.c:0 "Refuse their proposal."

cendem.47.t:0 "Panama Accepts Integration"
cendem.47.d:0 "The Panamanean government has agreed to be integrated into our nation once more. As the red, blue and white banner flies for the last time in Panama, the people look at our new brothers with enthusiasm as we enter a new tomorrow."
cendem.47.a:0 "Another diplomatic victory for our nation!"

cendem.48.t:0 "Panama Demands Autonomy within the Union!"
cendem.48.d:0 "Our delegation in Panama has informed us that the Panamaneans are interested in joining the Central American nation. However, they ask to be given a greater autonomy than the one we've given the other members of the confederation to the point that we would hardly have any executive power over them. What should be our response?"
cendem.48.a:0 "We accept their Terms."
cendem.48.b:0 "Recall the Delegation. We will solve this by force!"

cendem.49.t:0 "Panama Refuses to Join!"
cendem.49.d:0 "The Panamanean government have turned down our offer and refuse to join our nation. While many hot-headed politicians in the Unionista party are calling for war in order to solve this situation, the other parties find this solution completely abhorrent and ask for Panama to be left alone. However, this may be the last chance we get to unify all of Central America at long last, and we ought to weight our options carefully."
cendem.49.a:0 "Kindly accept their decision and try to keep friendly relations."
cendem.49.b:0 "Recall the Delegation. We will solve this by force!"

cendem.50.t:0 "Central America Accepts Our Request"
cendem.50.d:0 "Our new Central American brothers have accepted the terms of our agreement, and we're now making the move to complete our integration into their nation."
cendem.50.a:0 "We shall now join them!"

cendem.51.t:0 "Panama Joins Central America!"
cendem.51.d:0 "The Nation of Panama has decided to join the Central American nation and has managed to break free from our control! We have no other choice than to let them go in order to keep good relations with the Central American nation."
cendem.51.a:0 "Dammit!"

cendem.100.t:0 "Foundation of the Universidad Zamorano"
cendem.100.d:0 "Today, the Universidad Zamorano, has been founded in Honduras with the help of American Businessman Samuel Zemurray, one of the most influential UFC share-holders. The magnate, needing more capable manpower for his company, has generously founded the university for us to use as long as we recognize the institution and private. In order to solidify his staff, he has placed the renowned American botanist Wilson Popenoe, now widower of archaeologist Dorothy Popenoe, who will supervise all developments in the University and help students integrate faster to the UFC's working standards."
cendem.100.a:0 "One more step towards improving our nation."

cendem.101.t:0 "Foundation of the Universidad Centroamericana"
cendem.101.d:0 "The Compañía de Jesús has decided to make a contribution to our nation by funding the creation of a new university in Nicaragua. The project, lead by the Jesuit priest León Pallais Godoy, has opened its doors today, and our party has already offered to fund several of their careers in order to make education accessible for more Nicaraguans."
cendem.101.a:0 "We are grateful."

cendem.102.t:0 "Construction of the Ciudad Universitaria 'Dr. Fabio Castillo Figueroa'"
cendem.102.d:0 "The University of El Salvador was in need of an expansion, and since the times where the tyrant Martinez ruled their nation, the university has been more than willing to cooperate with the government. We shall woo them to our side by funding the acquisition of the San Carlos Homestead and beginning the expansion of their facilities. Hopefully this will help sustain the support of the PT in El Salvador, as well as improving the quality of our professional workforce in the future."
cendem.102.a:0 "San Salvador will become a place of knowledge!"

cendem.103.t:0 "Autonomisation of the Universidad Nacional de Honduras"
cendem.103.d:0 "The National University of Honduras has been under the control of the catholic church since its creation in 1847 where it was inaugurated with the sponsorship of Bishop Francisco de Paula Campoy y Pérez. Our cabinet has decided that the best way forward is to enforce our secularisation premises and pass the 'Ley Orgánica de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras', which shall put the institution under direct government control, and will assign them a yearly budget to allow more students to join in their search for higher education."
cendem.103.a:0 "Honduras has its education freed from oppression at last."

cendem.104.t:0 "The Other Parties Protest Our Intervention!"
cendem.104.d:0 "Backlash after the war declaration has been immediate. With the war being declared without being informed to the congress, the other parties have all come together in protest against our actions, and are actively calling out for Centroamerican citizens to burn their draft cards and to rally in the streets to protest our actions. Even our own supporters are slowly drifting away from our party after that rash decision, and we have no choice now but to accept the consequences of our actions."
cendem.104.a:0 "Damnit! It wasn't supposed to be like this!"

cendem.105.t:0 "Universidad Nacional de Guatemala Becomes Autonomous"
cendem.105.d:0 "The Guatemalan tyrants like Orellana and Ubico have reduced the old Universidad Nacional de Guatemala to a mere state puppet of foreign companies throughout the years, kicking students that didn't agree with their regimes and slowing down several others in order to force them to comply. In order to prevent this from happening in the future, we shall decree total autonomy for the University. From now on, the University will be officially known as the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala and will have their own election system, and a yearly budget that we shall adjust based on their needs and projects."
cendem.105.a:0 "Another trace of tyranny erased from our nation."

cendem.106.t:0 "The Book "El Señor Presidente" is Published"
cendem.106.d:0 "The Guatemalan writer Miguel Ángel Asturias has finally published what many consider to be his masterpiece. The author claims to have finished the book in 1933, having to hide his work for years from authoritarian regimes that would've censored it. His book, taking several characteristics of the Magic realism genre, explores the nature of dictatorships and its effects on the society at large. Many are drawing parallels with the book and Asturias' observations of the Cabrebra government in Guatemala, and is quickly becoming a hit both in our country and in the rest of Latin America, with even other renowned writers calling it a 'point of reference' for Latin American literature overall."
cendem.106.a:0 "A masterful work of literature!"

cendem.107.t:0 "Expenditure of a New Passport for Our Citizens"
cendem.107.d:0 "As the structure of the Central American nation becomes stronger with each passing day, we have decided to get rid of the old passports of the old individual members of the federation, and we will introduce a Central American Passport, so all who travel around the world be known as Central American, rather than part of an artificial construct like the previous nations were."
cendem.107.a:0 "Another step to unite our nation."

cendem.108.t:0 "The Central American Bank is Founded!"
cendem.108.d:0 "After having extensive talks with the several state banking institutions within the different nations, an agreement has been reached by all sides to create the Central American Bank, effectively dissolving all previous state banking institutions and putting their assets, both public and private, under the jurisdiction of the new entity. This move will certainly help reduce bureaucracy and facilitate the funding of projects throughout the nation, as we now only need to contact one bank instead of having to gather funds from several others for a single project. This unification has also left us with a great deal of extra capital available which will come in handy in the future reforms."
cendem.108.a:0 "Uniting our efforts, we can truly achieve greatness."

cendem.109.t:0 "Farmers Suffer from Autarky Efforts"
cendem.109.d:0 "As we allow foreign companies to enter our country, the rural areas of the country are seeing a massive exodus towards the cities, where many new industries are being placed in dire need of workers. The farms and plantations can't compete with the wages the industrial sector is offering, and this is causing a severe manpower shortage in the agricultural sector, reducing production levels and hurting the rural peasantry."
cendem.109.a:0 "It's the price of progress."

cendem.110.t:0 "Resource Scouting Expeditions Suffer Failures"
cendem.110.d:0 "In order to achieve total autarky, we have sent several expeditions to scout for resources throughout our country. However, our expeditions have reported back and there are hardly any new resources to be found, none that can be exploited on an industrial level. We have to unfortunately accept foreign resources as we can't sustain ourselves with our local ones."
cendem.110.a:0 "We will have to focus on industry then..."

cendem.111.t:0 "Industry Report of Our Last Reforms"
cendem.111.d:0 "As our industrial investment have started to report profits, the reports are underwhelming compared to our projections when we started project. It seems that, despite how much we invest in industry and infrastructure, we cannot fully achieve autarky since it's both hurting our rural peasantry and the industry is dependant on the imports of foreign raw materials in order to work. However, the industrial investment has yielded a significant amount of wealth for our cities' population, and while autarky is now proving more and more to be impossible, we are still being benefited by our investments."
cendem.111.a:0 "Well, we'll have to balance our system from now on."

cendem.112.t:0 "Equal Laws for an Equal People"
cendem.112.d:0 "As we push for new legislation throughout our nation, we are noticing more and more regional laws that undermine the livelihood of the black and native populations in our nation. As we enter a new age for our subcontinent, we are endeavouring our efforts towards cleaning up the remains of these despotic legislations and truly embracing the ideals of civic nationalism, allowing these minorities to truly take part in our nation's decision making and every day affairs. In order to do so, President [Root.GetLeader] has decreed that all old prejudices from old legislations be abolished, and a new set of Federal laws be complied in the individual regions. Considering the Decentralized approach of the PNR, this has come to surprise the PT, but it's a move that is both supported by the PL and PUD, allowing the legislation to be passed without further issues."
cendem.112.a:0 "Diversity is not a weakness, it's a strength!"

cendem.113.t:0 "Restrictive Laws Placed on the Military"
cendem.113.d:0 "With the decades of authoritarianism that Central America has endured, President [Root.GetLeader] has decided to enact a series of law reforms to restrain and contain military power to strictly national defence, and has proposed several safeguards to be added to the constitution in order to prevent a military takeover to happen ever again."
cendem.113.a:0 "We seek to avoid the errors of the past."

cendem.114.t:0 "Corruption Trials Start"
cendem.114.d:0 "After a great deal of debate with the PL, the corruption trials have finally been authorized by the congress. An in depth national investigation has started and several names of several important companies, including the United Fruit Company have come out. These individuals will be processed for their crimes and enacted an embargo of their ill-acquired goods and apply a jail sentence in the most extreme cases. Hopefully, this process will finish soon enough, and without major repercussions"
cendem.114.a:0 "Money can't save you from the swift hammer of Justice!"

cendem.115.t:0 "Nationalisation Laws Create Controversy"
cendem.115.d:0 "After our nationalisation laws managed to be passed with a very slim majority, several representatives of the Partido Unionista and the Partido Liberal have come together to express their discontent at this turn of events, even accusing us of trying to collectivize the economy. While these insults are nothing but buzzwords, we are aware that there's public unrest regarding this law, and we should try to restrict its use to only key economic sectors."
cendem.115.a:0 "We need to thread carefully."

cendem.116.t:0 "Corruption Trials End"
cendem.116.d:0 "After several hundred employees and concerned citizens have testified, and solid evidence has been presented, around 500 individuals, among high ranking politicians and industrial and rural barons, have been identified of embezzlement and illicit enrichment, and have been sentenced to a 4 million dollar embargo and varying prison times depending on the severity of their crimes. While there probably is still plenty of local corruption, the overall goal for the party has been achieved. While the search for corruption will continue, it'll be at a slower pace, and delegated to the individual states."
cendem.116.a:0 "The future has become a bit brighter."

cendem.199.t:0 "Friendship with the Central American Nations"
cendem.199.d:0 "As we now look to expand our influence abroad, the chamber of deputies has come forth with a series of diplomatic proposals to improve relations with our neighbouring nations. While we certainly do not know what the result of this action will entail, we do know that we are trying to reassure our diplomatic position in the continent as well as securing the future peace of our nation."

CEN_Forging_Uniformity:0 "Forging Uniformity"
CEN_Forging_Uniformity_desc:0 "Our forces right now are a mixed bag of units with varying levels of training and equipment standards.

CEN_Complete_Integration:0 "Complete the Integration"
CEN_Complete_Integration_desc:0 "With our army following a standard, we now just need to integrate the local officer corps into a unified meritocratic system, trying to adapt the officers to a new hierarchy in order to correctly give them their ranks based on their experience and knowledge, rather than any other random standard that the previous republics had."
CEN_One_Army_One_Head:0 "Joint Command Leaders"
CEN_One_Army_One_Head_desc:0 "Our army currently have separate planning boards made up of different officers from different academies scattered throughout the region.

CEN_Longterm_Planning:0 "Long-term Planning"
CEN_Longterm_Planning_desc:0 "With our army ready for combat, it would be a wise move to start preparing several defence and offence plans in case of an attack by a foreign power to our nation, not much unlike the United States prepares their Rainbow Plans.

CEN_Learn_To_Dig:0 "Entrenchment Training"
CEN_Learn_To_Dig_desc:0 "The harsh terrain in Central America make the art of trench digging a lot more difficult than it is in European battlefields.

CEN_extensive_games:0 "Extensive War Games"
CEN_extensive_games_desc:0 "Only practice can prepare us if a conflict is ever to threaten Central American Democracy once more, and it's because of this that we shall begin an ambitious set of war games to prepare our troops to fight in all manner of environments.

CEN_long_conscription:0 "Instate Long Conscription Times"
CEN_long_conscription_desc:0 "Our soldiers are precious, and their experience is now more important than ever before. We can't allow that expertise to be wasted on the civilian front if it's not needed, and so we shall increase conscription times.

CEN_Support_Groups:0 "Support Teams Integration"
CEN_Support_Groups_desc:0 "An elite force isn't just a bunch of veteran soldiers carrying out orders. There have to be engineers assisting their advance on harsh terrains and scouts helping them avoid enemy strongholds and attack enemy weak points.

CEN_Artillery_Corps:0 "Incorporate Shelling into the Doctrine"
CEN_Artillery_Corps_desc:0 "With our system, we cannot depend on a number advantage to beat the enemy. Luckily, one of the greatest inventions in the 20th century for warfare has been artillery, which allows us to pound enemy positions from relative safety as long as we can outrange the enemy's artillery. In order to always have the upper hand against their artillery, we shall begin investing in better artillery models."

CEN_motorised_desc:0 "With the improvement in speed in cars during the last few decades, the military relevance of motorised and mechanised cannot be underestimated.

CEN_speed:0 "Swiftness is key"
CEN_speed_desc:0 "Armies that can't secure a victory quickly inevitably get drawn into prolonged attrition wars which are both costly and ineffective. We cannot afford ourselves to be drawn into such a conflict with our new armed forces, and it is for this reason that we should focus on achieving a swift victory over our enemies rather than pushing ourselves into an attrition war."
CEN_combined_arms:0 "Combined Arms Training"
CEN_combined_arms_desc:0 "The theory of combined arms combat is growing more relevant as the use of radio allows for greater coordination between the army, the armoured corps and the air force to combat the enemy more effectively.

CEN_conscription_propaganda:0 "Voluntary but Encouraged Conscription"
CEN_conscription_propaganda_desc:0 "Volunteers for the army before were few and far in between, mainly because the armies had a bad reputation of harbouring tyrants in waiting and having poor living conditions for the average soldier.

CEN_decentralised_plans:0 "Inter-Republican War Plan Simulations"
CEN_decentralised_plans_desc:0 "Only through practice we can manage to keep the edge of the several internal armies in case of a foreign invasion.

CEN_social_works:0 "Army Infrastructure Projects"

CEN_no_nepotism_desc:0 "Nepotism has been practically endemic in most of Central America, and while we do understand that 'better the devil you know than the devil you don't' has its usages in the military sphere, we can't afford the creation of military dynasties in our army that are not based on merit. We shall enact strict meritocratic measures to restrict generals from promoting family members unless they offer the qualifications needed for their posts."
CEN_military_parades:0 "Military Parades"
CEN_military_parades_desc:0 "A way of instilling pride for our armed forces is the celebration of yearly military parades nationwide, to give a chance to each local army to show off both at home and in the rest of the country the achievements they have accomplished in terms of discipline in such a short time. We shall decree the celebration of a military parade, effective immediately and that shall be made an annual celebration."

CEN_loyalty_desc:0 "Our armies, beyond their individual loyalties to their respective nation, also have a responsibility to a national scale to protect their brothers and sisters from the other members of the Confederacy as well as they would defend their own people.

CEN_Three_kinds_of_Aces:0 "Ace Pilot Initiative"
CEN_Three_kinds_of_Aces_desc:0 "The morale and effectivity of our Air Force will grow exponentially if our pilots have heroes to look up to and emulate.

CEN_Live_For_Pride_desc:0 "Our pilots need to be trained in what could be called the art of dogfighting.

CEN_Read_The_Tide_of_Battle:0 "Long Range Detection"
CEN_Read_The_Tide_of_Battle_desc:0 "RADARs are starting to become more and more common with new developments like the Decimetric radar allowing for a more accurate tracking of aerial objects in a determined airspace.

CEN_Fighter_Bombers:0 "Fighter-Bombers"
CEN_Fighter_Bombers_desc:0 "Our current bomber fleet cannot properly protect itself, and our fighter fleet cannot properly damage the enemy. We must introduce a new type of plane to our Air Force, the fighter-bomber.

CEN_Sea_Bomber_Trials:0 "Sea-Bomber Trials"
CEN_Sea_Bomber_Trials_desc:0 "Our current Air Force lacks the power to damage enemy ships. We need to develop specialized sea-bombers that will be able to bomb enemy ships much more effectively.

## Naval Tree

CEN_Propose_Naval_Ventures_desc:0 "Our current navy is weak. Therefore, we must take a look at the possibility of focusing our military efforts on expanding it.

CEN_Merhcant_Fleets:0 "The Merchant Fleet"
CEN_Merhcant_Fleets_desc:0 "Our country lacks a formal merchant navy to speak off, and if we even want to consider starting a formal military navy, then maybe we should worry about acquiring a civilian navy first. We shall buy a few transport ships in the world market and then invest in some small dockyards to maintain these small merchant fleet."
CEN_Training_Next_Gen:0 "Next Generation of Naval Officers"
CEN_Training_Next_Gen_desc:0 "Our expanding navy requires officers that can properly handle the crews and effectively control our ships.

CEN_Flagship_Designs:0 "Flagship Designs"
CEN_Flagship_Designs_desc:0 "With our reforms nearly finished, we are in dire need of a flagship for our navy. Not only due to its symbolical value, but because a flagship would become the sword and shield of our fleet, serving as a naval command platform to coordinate the rest of the fleet and as a formidable foe to any enemy ships in battle."

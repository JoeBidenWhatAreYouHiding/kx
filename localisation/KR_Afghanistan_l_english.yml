### Leaders ###
POLITICS_AMANULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Who but Babur has ever brought greater change and prestige to Afghanistan than Amanullah Khan? Ascended to the throne amidst the Weltkrieg, Amanullah immediately attacked the British Empire and won handsome concessions. He capitalized on this victory and subsequent further gains following the collapse of the British Empire to implement sweeping social reforms. Though Amanullah's rule remains absolute, he dreams of bringing true constitutional governance to Afghanistan and overcoming the nation's deep ethnic and tribal divisions. Time will tell if this great reformer's vision shall come to be."
POLITICS_HABIBULLAH_KALAKANI_DESC:0 "An ethnic Tajik, Kalakani was a longtime officer in the Afghan Royal Army who deserted a bit before chaos of the collapse of the British Empire. Using that chaos and the regular army's pre-occupation, Kalakani turned to a life of crime. Once the army managed to restore a modicum of order however, Kalakani fled and sought the protection of his Tajik co-ethnics.\nOutspokenly opposed to the reforms and modernisation campaigns of Amamnullah Khan, Kalakani came to head a rural ultra-conservative movement bearing his name. Rather shockingly, his movement successfully overthrew Amanullah and Kalakani has won the Afghan crown."

### Events ###
afg.0.t:0 "The 5th Anglo-Afghan War?"
afg.0.d:0 "In the remnants of the Raj to our south, dissent has sprung up like wildflowers in the wake of [CAN_king_full_name]'s succession. In Kabul, we have our own troubles keeping the latent discontent of reform down. A repeat of the victorious Fourth Anglo-Afghan War might cement our own position whilst winning new lands and subjects for the crown!"
afg.0.a:0 "The time is ripe! Let us repeat our victories!"
afg.0.b:0 "What does India have but cows?"

afg.1.t:0 "The Third Treaty of Rawalpindi"
afg.1.d:0 "Catastrophe! Our campaign against the Delhi Government has been crowned with spectacular failure and our armies are fleeing in panic through the Pass of Khyber. The viceroy, Ganga Singh, has offered peace, demanding a restoration of pre-1926 borders. Unfortunately, we are unable to decline lest our very nation be destroyed..."
afg.1.d.puppet:0 "Catastrophe! Our campaign against the Delhi Government has been crowned with spectacular failure and our armies are fleeing in panic through the Pass of Khyber. The viceroy, Ganga Singh, has offered peace - demanding a restoration of pre-1926 borders and the permanent submission of our government to theirs. Unfortunately, we are unable to decline lest our very nation be destroyed..."
afg.1.a:0 "We yield because we have no other choice..."

afg.2.t:0 "The Third Treaty of Rawalpindi"
afg.2.d:0 "Victory is ours! We have utterly routed the decadent British lapdogs in Delhi and our forces are entrenched in the smouldering remains of their capital. Now might be the best time to demand concessions, whilst we still carry the lead."
afg.2.a:0 "Let us claim Kashmir and carve a path to the Mouth of the Indus!"
afg.2.b:0 "I shall be the emancipator and liberator of all Mohammedans in the Indus Valley!"
afg.2.c:0 "No peace with idol-worshippers, let us complete our conquest!"

afg.3.t:0 "Demands of the Emir"
afg.3.d:0 "Curses! The Afghan dogs have completely overpowered us and have reduced our proud nation to humiliation. Now the Afghan Emir demands our surrender of the princely state of Kashmir and access to the Mouth of the Indus. Although these are harsh terms, it might be wise to comply lest our rivals on the continent act on our exposed situation."
afg.3.a:0 "We yield because we have no other choice..."
afg.3.b:0 "They must be joking! Hindustan Zindabad!"

afg.4.t:0 "The Delhi Government Refuses!"
afg.4.d:0 "Foolishly, the British lapdogs have refused our rightful claims."
afg.4.a:0 "The war continues!"

afg.5.t:0 "Shia Muslims Flee The War"
afg.5.d:0 "For decades, the situation of the Shia minority in Afghanistan has been bad. The post-war situation wasn't gold, and another war could only make it worse. Shia imams in the provinces of Herat and Farah have encouraged the Shia minority to flee into their friendly neighbour Persia. Let's hope the Persians send them back, as we need that manpower."
afg.5.a:0 "Traitors!"

afg.6.t:0 "Refugees from Afghanistan"
afg.6.d:0 "Yet another war has started between Afghanistan and the Dominion of India. The Shi'a minority in Afghanistan fears this will only make their situation worse, and they have decided to start a new life here. However, this situation might be more problematic than we think. If we accept these people into our nation, the government of Afghanistan will be deeply upset with us."
afg.6.a:0 "They shall be more than welcome, settle them in Mashad!"
afg.6.b:0 "This would be meddling in Afghan domestic politics, refuse them!"

afg.7.t:0 "Persia Closes Its Borders"
afg.7.d:0 "The Persians made the right choice and sent our people back home."
afg.7.a:0 "Hurrah!"

afg.8.t:0 "Domestic Reaction to Afghan Defeat"
afg.8.d:0 "The defeat of our armies has sent shock waves through Afghanistan! Our secret service reports huge dissatisfaction with the royal government amongst both the peasants and the army! Even worse, radical clerics are drumming up support for a general insurrection against the royal reform programme! These are truly dark times for our small kingdom."
afg.8.a:0 "The King can do as he likes! Suppress any rebellion!"
afg.8.c:0 "Mohammed Nadir deposes Amanullah and proclaims himself king!"

afg.9.t:0 "Order in Afghanistan"
afg.9.d:0 "The revolutionary tendencies in the people of Afghanistan have been suppresssed, and we have restored order to the nation."
afg.9.a:0 "Here's to a better tomorrow."

afg.10.t:0 "Afghanistan in Chaos!"
afg.10.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, rebel forces have pushed the troops of king Amanullah out of Kabul and are in effect in control of the country!"
afg.10.b:0 "General Nadir's brigades defeat all opposition and proclaim him king!"

afg.14.t:0 "Mohammed Nadir Khan's Claim to the Throne"
afg.14.d:0 "As he assumed the throne through not-so-cordial methods and his relations to the royal family, Mohammed Nadir Khan desperately needs legitimacy to shore up his regime. It is suggested that his majesty convey a 'loya jirga' (grand assembly) of Pashtun leaders to confirm his ascension."
afg.14.a:0 "Call a loya jirga to confirm my ascension!"

afg.15.t:0 "Mohammed Nadir Khan and the Loya Jirga"
afg.15.d:0 "Speaking before the Grand Assembly of tribal leaders, Nadir Khan hopes to receive enough support to continue his rule unhindered."
afg.15.a:0 "The assembly hails Mohammed Nadir as king!"
afg.15.b:0 "The assembly denounces Mohammed Nadir!"

afg.16.t:0 "Nadir Khan's Royal Oligarchy"
afg.16.d:0 "With the war-torn country finally restored to some semblance of order, Nadir Khan has resolved to reorganise his cabinet to secure continued stability for Afghanistan. Packing the government with relatives would be the obvious way to bind the state apparatus to Nadir's ambitions, but reaching out to some of Amanullah's supporters might also bridge a wide gap between the radical and moderate reformists."
afg.16.a:0 "Let my younger brother, Shah Wali Khan, enforce my will!"
afg.16.b:0 "My brother, Muhammed Hashim, will head the government!"
afg.16.c:0 "The meek academic Muhammed Ghobar shall 'lead' the cabinet!"
afg.16.e:0 "Woo Ammanulah's clique and appoint Abdul Hadi Dawai!"
afg.16.f:0 "Total royal control! I shall solely wield all executive power!"

afg.17.t:0 "Status of Amanullah's Reforms"
afg.17.d:0 "Mohammed Nadir Khan has taken control of our shaken nation after the failure of Amanullah Khan to enforce Afghan progress. Well aware that a great factor to his predecessor's downfall was the speed of his westernisation reforms, Nadir Khan nonetheless has to address the great issue of rebuilding Afghanistan."
afg.17.a:0 "Discontinue social reform, but galvanise the improvement of our infrastructure!"
afg.17.b:0 "Cave in to the traditionalists and abandon all pretence of modernity!"
afg.17.c:0 "I shall succeed where Amanullah failed and bring Afghanistan into the modern world!"

afg.18.t:0 "Sarrafs leave Afghanistan"
afg.18.d:0 "Sarrafs are a group of Indian merchants who travel between Afghanistan and Delhi, exchanging money and trading goods in both of them. Our economy hardly depends on their visits. Now, the war has come and borders are safe no more. Only a few of these sarrafs are brave enough to continue trading with us. With most of their caravans gone, we now suffer from an economic crisis."
afg.18.a:0 "We don't need these Indian dogs anyway!"

afg.19.t:0 "Sarrafs return"
afg.19.d:0 "The war is over and borders are now safe. Nothing more disturbs the sarrafs now and the first wave of them have already resumed their trading within Afghanistan. Soon, our economy will recover."
afg.19.a:0 "Welcome, gentlemen!"

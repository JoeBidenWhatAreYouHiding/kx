### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MARMADUKE_GROVE_DESC:0 "Grove was born in the northern city of Copiapó on 6 July 1878 to José Marmaduke Grove Abalos, a lawyer, and Ana Vallejo Burgoa. In 1891, his father was exiled for opposing President José Manuel Balmaceda. Despite his early opposition to the ruling authorities, he joined the Chilean naval academy in 1892. Exiled due to his socialist tendencies, he was chosen to perform a role as a liaison in Great Britain, effectively just to keep him out of Chile. But there he took part in the Revolution, and during his exile, During the rule of President Ibañez Del Campo, Chile's economy worsened and in 1931 the country went bankrupt. Shortly after this, Ibañez was deposed when most of the army and navy mutinied, allowing for Grove's return to Chile and the proclamation of the Socialist Republic. His recent ascension to the post of Chairman is one that clearly signals that both Military and Civil authorities in Chile consider conflict with Argentina nigh inevitable after years of support for the Patagonian rebels."

### Focuses ###
CHL_air:0 "Update Air Force Philosophy"
CHL_air_desc:0 "Our air doctrines are still a relic of the time of early aviation, and what was once cutting edge now belongs in a museum. Our pilots and planning will be updated accordingly."
CHL_air2:0 "Aerial Production"
CHL_air2_desc:0 "The sudden cut of funding for the air force is perhaps a key factor why it joined us in the Revolution; now we should take the utmost care to ensure that our airplanes are both modern and well cared for. Thankfully, we have comrades from the Union of Britain who can me most helpful in this endeavour."
CHL_fighter:0 "Fighter Effort"
CHL_fighter2:0 "Close Air Support Craft" #CAS
CHL_fighter3:0 "Long Range Aircraft Experiments" #long range aircraft
CHL_fighter_desc:0 "Aerial supremacy is key in modern war, of that few can doubt; But the advent of new mechanisms of war means that our old biplanes are not suitable for defending the skies of Chile anymore."
CHL_fighter2_desc:0 "Air superiority could be meaningless if we cannot capitalise in help for our troops on the frontlines; not only special aircraft is required, but specific training too."
CHL_fighter3_desc:0 "Our country is, from an strategic standpoint, too long in a North-South axis to be properly protected by common fighter craft. We must ensure, with the help of our comrades in Europe, that our Air Force has planes capable of long autonomous flights."
CHL_airdoc:0 "Aerial Strategy"
CHL_airdoc2_desc:0 "The engagements themselves are also to be analysed, and our few planes cannot be foolishly thrown away. Careful studying and manoeuvres will be key in our coming victory."
CHL_airdoc_desc:0 "Aerial engagements are quick and brutal affairs; and it pays to plan for them and strategic missions beforehand. What will be the focus of our air force in the war to come, our general staff must decide."
CHL_airdoc2:0 "Aerial Tactics"
CHL_bomber:0 "Bomber Effort"

CHL_highseas:0 "A High Seas Navy"
CHL_highseas_desc:0 "The decisive battles of the wars to come will be fought on deep waters, away from coastal support. In order to make sure our navy is ready for this crucial engagement against a certain undisclosed enemy to the West, we will make drills, exercises and planning efforts."
CHL_dockyard:0 "Fleet Renewal"
CHL_dockyard_desc:0 "Our fleet, while well armed and well supplied, has many second hand or outdated vessels; If we are to modernise it, we must spare no expense in dockyards, shipyards and weapon systems."

CHL_arms_of_the_revolution:0 "A Nation Under Siege"
CHL_arms_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The biggest danger to Chile is not internal, but that of the resurrecting counter-revolutionary Argentina.

We will not let happen!"
CHL_mobility_potential:0 "Mobility Potential"
CHL_mobility_potential_desc:0 "Many have heard ideas and plans about how modern warfare will be a fast-paced, mechanised affair; even if that may not turn out to be the case, we do not have the manpower to engage in traditional war with Argentina and the other imperialists. We will do our best to improve the mobility of our forces."
CHL_communard_expertise:0 "Foreign Armour Expertise"
CHL_communard_expertise_desc:0 "Mobility has always been of great import on the battlefield.

We should hire such men from abroad."

CHL_army_rearmament:0 "Army Rearmament"
CHL_army_rearmament_desc:0 "While the army is not underpaid or underfed as it used to be before the Revolution, it is still poorly equipped. Let us attend to the needs of our officers and ensure our Army can fight off any threats."

CHL_mountaineers_desc:0 "The Mountains that surround us are an integral part of any national defence plan in case of invasion. Passes, peaks and hillsides must not be garrisoned with fresh recruits, but with elite specially trained regiments who are ready for the harsh reality of mountain life."
CHL_andean_strategy:0 "Andean Strategy"
CHL_andean_strategy_desc:0 "The so-called Santiago Line will be the last stand of our nation, if Argentina overpowers us and crossed the Andes.

CHL_long_term_planning:0 "Long Term Planning"
CHL_long_term_planning_desc:0 "Not only battles and combat engagements are important, but the very movement and organisation of both our forces and that of our enemies will be thoroughly studied, and prepare our general staff for the challenge of the coming War of Imperialism."

CHL_permanet:0 "Permanent Revolution Doctrine"

CHL_directrule:0 "Centralised Planning"
CHL_directrule_desc:0 "All decisions about he economic and state well being must be consulted with Central Committees in Santiago. To do otherwise would be clumsy at best, treason at worst."

CHL_getcounterrev:0 "Ensure Officer Loyalty"
CHL_getcounterrev_desc:0 "Many officers are still traditionalist and archaic, who might as well be theocrats with their sad devotion to ancient religions. But their priests did not grant them clairvoyance to conjure up an escape from the Revolutionary Courts!"

CHL_extended:0 "Extend CSC Powers"
CHL_extended_desc:0 "The Congress of Syndicates is now a true house of democracy, unlike the parliament of the Old Republic. However, it is still quite powerless in many matters, a relic of our over-centralising presidentialist past. We must remedy this!"

chl.2.d:0 "Our young republic now holds its second central elections; much fanfare and celebration is held, and 3 main candidates attempt to sway the votes of the workers. Blest Riffo, a long time fighter of worker's rights during the worst times of repression, is favoured both by Marmaduke and most of the mainline Syndicalists, and thus the majority of voters. Against him runs the young Salvador Allende, whose very opposition broad coalition us as diverse as it is rather un-cohesive, but they promise a better future for Chile. Also, with rather minute chances, the Internationalists, influenced by the ideas of European Socialists, are running with Labarca as their frontman. What will the people decide?"

A phase of economic prosperity was initiated, supported by the high demand for saltpetre at the beginning of Weltkrieg. However, the chemical processes devised during that war to artificially produce saltpetre rendered Chile's deposits worthless. Worsening economic circumstances, together with the growth of the population increased social crisis. Workers and unions gained political influence, especially under the disastrous rule of Carlos Ibañez Del Campo, during which Chile bankrupted, in 1931. Shortly afterwards. Ibañez was deposed, and the navy and most of the army mutinied, and with the support of the people, and the of arrival of reinforcements from the long exiled Marmaduke Grove arriving from the Union of Britain, the Socialist Republic of Chile was proclaimed. After 5 years of rebuilding under the first council, led at least nominally by Arturo Puga, the republican economy recovered greatly, and a military build-up has begun. Now, with Argentina's rhetoric becoming increasingly aggressive, the well respected Marmaduke Grove, military man veteran of two revolutions oceans apart, is at the helm of the rebuilding the republic. However, not all Chileans are as hopeful for the future as the syndicalist leaders are..."

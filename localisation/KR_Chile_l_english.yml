### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MARMADUKE_GROVE_DESC: "Grove was born in the northern city of Copiapó on 6 July 1878 to José Marmaduke Grove Abalos, a lawyer, and Ana Vallejo Burgoa. In 1891, his father was exiled for opposing President José Manuel Balmaceda. Despite his early opposition to the ruling authorities, he joined the Chilean naval academy in 1892. Exiled due to his socialist tendencies, he was chosen to perform a role as a liaison in Great Britain, effectively just to keep him out of Chile. But there he took part in the Revolution, and during his exile, During the rule of President Ibañez Del Campo, Chile's economy worsened and in 1931 the country went bankrupt. Shortly after this, Ibañez was deposed when most of the army and navy mutinied, allowing for Grove's return to Chile and the proclamation of the Socialist Republic. His recent ascension to the post of Chairman is one that clearly signals that both Military and Civil authorities in Chile consider conflict with Argentina nigh inevitable after years of support for the Patagonian rebels."

### Focuses ###
CHL_air: "Update Air Force Philosophy"

CHL_air2: "Aerial Production"
CHL_air2_desc: "The sudden cut of funding for the air force is perhaps a key factor why it joined us in the Revolution; now we should take the utmost care to ensure that our airplanes are both modern and well cared for. Thankfully, we have comrades from the Union of Britain who can me most helpful in this endeavour."
CHL_fighter: "Fighter Effort"
CHL_fighter2: "Close Air Support Craft" #CAS
CHL_fighter3: "Long Range Aircraft Experiments" #long range aircraft
CHL_fighter_desc: "Aerial supremacy is key in modern war, of that few can doubt; But the advent of new mechanisms of war means that our old biplanes are not suitable for defending the skies of Chile anymore."

CHL_fighter3_desc: "Our country is, from an strategic standpoint, too long in a North-South axis to be properly protected by common fighter craft. We must ensure, with the help of our comrades in Europe, that our Air Force has planes capable of long autonomous flights."
CHL_airdoc: "Aerial Strategy"
CHL_airdoc2_desc: "The engagements themselves are also to be analysed, and our few planes cannot be foolishly thrown away. Careful studying and manoeuvres will be key in our coming victory."
CHL_airdoc_desc: "Aerial engagements are quick and brutal affairs; and it pays to plan for them and strategic missions beforehand. What will be the focus of our air force in the war to come, our general staff must decide."

CHL_navy_desc: "Our fleet, with its recent additions and investments in the term of Chairman Puga, is perhaps the most powerful in South America; it is most certainly the most well armed fighting force of the South Pacific, and well capable of both defensive and offensive operations."
CHL_highseas: "A High Seas Navy"
CHL_highseas_desc: "The decisive battles of the wars to come will be fought on deep waters, away from coastal support. In order to make sure our navy is ready for this crucial engagement against a certain undisclosed enemy to the West, we will make drills, exercises and planning efforts."

We will not let happen!"

We will do our best to improve the mobility of our forces."

CHL_communard_expertise_desc: "Mobility has always been of great import on the battlefield.

CHL_andean_strategy_desc: "The so-called Santiago Line will be the last stand of our nation, if Argentina overpowers us and crossed the Andes.

CHL_permanet: "Permanent Revolution Doctrine"
CHL_permanet_desc: "Something that Labarcists defend, the idea that the Revolution can only be maintained by force, for reactionary elements cannot be reasoned or bargained with. The Proletarian Dictatorship will be permanent until it's not longer necessary."
CHL_directrule: "Centralised Planning"
CHL_directrule_desc: "All decisions about he economic and state well being must be consulted with Central Committees in Santiago. To do otherwise would be clumsy at best, treason at worst."
CHL_chairmanmega: "Extend Chairman's Powers"
CHL_chairmanmega_desc: "The Chairman still requires approval from the Syndicalist Congress for many actions, something that greatly cripples the capacity of our state to react. We must change this!"
CHL_commisariats: "Revolutionary Commissars"
CHL_commisariats_desc: "Now, we can have appointed officers in army units and factories, ensuring both loyalty and hard work at all times, for an idle mind is an invitation to counter-revolution."

chl.2.t: "The Third Chairman"
chl.2.d: "Our young republic now holds its second central elections; much fanfare and celebration is held, and 3 main candidates attempt to sway the votes of the workers. Blest Riffo, a long time fighter of worker's rights during the worst times of repression, is favoured both by Marmaduke and most of the mainline Syndicalists, and thus the majority of voters. Against him runs the young Salvador Allende, whose very opposition broad coalition us as diverse as it is rather un-cohesive, but they promise a better future for Chile. Also, with rather minute chances, the Totalists, influenced by the ideas of European Socialists like Mosley and Beira, are running with Labarca as their frontman. What will the people decide?"

A phase of economic prosperity was initiated, supported by the high demand for saltpetre at the beginning of Weltkrieg. However, the chemical processes devised during that war to artificially produce saltpetre rendered Chile's deposits worthless. Worsening economic circumstances, together with the growth of the population increased social crisis. Workers and unions gained political influence, especially under the disastrous rule of Carlos Ibañez Del Campo, during which Chile bankrupted, in 1931. Shortly afterwards. Ibañez was deposed, and the navy and most of the army mutinied, and with the support of the people, and the of arrival of reinforcements from the long exiled Marmaduke Grove arriving from the Union of Britain, the Syndicalist Republic of Chile was proclaimed. After 5 years of rebuilding under the first council, led at least nominally by Arturo Puga, the republican economy recovered greatly, and a military build-up has begun. Now, with Argentina's rhetoric becoming increasingly aggressive, the well respected Marmaduke Grove, military man veteran of two revolutions oceans apart, is at the helm of the rebuilding the republic. However, not all Chileans are as hopeful for the future as the syndicalist leaders are..."

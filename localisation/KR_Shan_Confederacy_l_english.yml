In September of 1927, he was chosen as successor to his uncle as Saopha of Yawnghwe by the Federated Shan States' Council of Ministers, officially assuming office on March 8th, 1929.\n\nSao Shwe Thaik entered politics in post-British Burma, becoming a strong advocate for democracy and autonomy of the Shan States, becoming well respected amongst other political leaders in Burma.\n\nWith the occupation of the Shan States and the horrible treatment by their overlords, Sao Shwe Thaik decided to take initiative and break free from the Shan States' oppressive controllers, declaring the Shan Confederation with a number of other saophas. He now leads his newly-independent country, hoping to steer it into a new age."

### Events ###

shan.1.t: "Independence of the Shan Confederation"
shan.1.d: "The Shan State, inhabited by the local Tai people, has for many years been a point of contention between powers in Asia. Ruling in the mountains of Shan are the saophas, ruling their own small kingdoms in the region since the 1200s. It underwent many wars, with the kingdoms constantly raiding neighboring regions. When the British came, the saophas submitted, but after the Weltkrieg and the collapse of the British Emppire in the 1920s, Burma broke free from the Empire with Shan in tow. The Kingdom of Siam briefly invaded Shan State, taking the area now known by them as Saharat Thai Doem. Shan had always fought for more rights under the Burmese regime, and now, after the Chinese takeover, the saophas of Shan have rebelled, in the hope that one day, the Tai people will be free once again."
shan.1.a: "Loyal to Shan we'll ever be."

shan.2.t: "The Kokang Plan"
shan.2.d: "The recently promoted General Sao Yang Wen Pin, Saopha of Kokang, has sketched out a plan to retake Kokang, currently under Yunnanese control. Though ethnically Chinese himself, Sao Yang Wen Pin feels no sympathy for the Yunnan Clique, and identifies much more with Kokang and, by extension, the Shan Confederation. The promises Kunming gives are large, but he is, in his heart, a native of Shan. With the city under our control, we would be able to cross the river separating Shan and China, and spill in our troops from there."
shan.2.a: "Let's hope this works out for us."

shan.3.t: "Moving Forwards After the War"
shan.3.d: "Now that Shan has been consolidated and our confederation is at peace, we must now choose the path by which we will follow. The saophas are to be convened at Yawnghwe Haw to discuss such matters, and the future of our nation will be decided there, now that we have finished our fight for independence."
shan.3.a: "We must tread the way that is best for us."

shan.4.t: "The Yawnghwe Conference"
shan.4.d: "And so it has been done - the saophas are gathered at Yawnghwe Haw, the center of our capital, Taunggyi, and the home of Sao Shwe Thaik. The saophas are strongly in favor of keeping the status quo, a democratic, pacifist confederation of the various Shan states. However, some have also raised the question of willingly giving up their power in order for a more unified and stable nation, safe from any other potential foreign invasions. While the status quo is widely popular and even supported by Sao Shwe Thaik, fears of another Yunnanese invasion are widespread too, and centralization might be a better path for the nation. The only thing that remains is for the decision to be made, and Shan will go down the path chosen here, today, at Taunggyi."
shan.4.a: "The Confederation is the way forwards!"
shan.4.b: "Reform and Centralization!"

shan.5.t: "Sao Shwe Thaik's Speech at Taunggyi"
shan.5.d: "This morning, the people of Taunggyi and neighboring towns gathered outside the City Hall and the government building to hear Sao Shwe Thaik speak. He gave a rousing speech, speaking about the hard-fought sovereignty of Shan state, and of the pacifist and just road the Confederation would take. Invited onto the stage were various saophas and leaders in the government."
shan.5.a: "Inspiring."

shan.6.t: "The Drug Trade in Shan"
shan.6.d: "Shan is a part of the Golden Triangle, an infamous region in the world known for its opium production and trading. It is a major source of income for many people, especially to the North, in Kachin. However, illegal opium trading has become a problem within the Shan Confederation. What do we do with the drug trade?"
shan.6.a: "Limit and tax it."
shan.6.b: "Let's not anger the traders."
shan.6.c: "Round the illegal traders up and imprison them!"

shan.7.t: "A Diplomatic Visit to Myitkyina"
shan.7.d: "The State of Kachin, to the North, fought with us in the Independence war. In the interests of preserving friendly diplomatic relations between the two nations of Shan and Kachin, Sao Shwe Thaik and a diplomatic delegation have decided to go to Myitkyina for a diplomatic visit, and to discuss the future of our two, newly-independent nations."
shan.7.a: "Bon voyage!"

shan.8.t: "The Delegation Returns from Kachin"
shan.8.d: "Sao Shwe Thaik and the Shan diplomatic delegation have returned after a two-week trip to Kachin, where they were greeted by the locals in Myitkyina and the Jingpho government leaders with great hospitality and friendliness. A conference was held at Myitkyina in which the leaders of the Shan and Kachin governments talked about future cooperation between the two nations."
shan.8.a: "Welcome back!"

shan.9.t: "A Diplomatic Visit from Shan"
shan.9.d: "Sao Shwe Thaik and a group of important officials in the government of Shan are about to come to our capital, Myitkyina, in the interests of preserving our two countries' friendly relations after the war against the Yunnan Clique. We have agreed to host them, and preparations are being made for their arrival."
shan.9.a: "Let them come to Myitkyina."

shan.10.t: "The Shan Delegation Returns to Taunggyi"
shan.10.d: "After two weeks of talks and tours, Sao Shwe Thaik and the delegation from Shan has said their goodbyes with Kachin. The talks were overwhelmingly successful, giving economic and social benefits to both the countries and their citizens. Future cooperation has also been talked about, and the two newly-independent nations have been brought together even more."
shan.10.a: "Come back soon!"

shan.11.t: "Self-Improvement in Shan"
shan.11.d: "Under the guidance of their saophas, the people of many states in Shan have begun to modernize more and improve their living conditions. More modern, 1920s toilets were installed in rural towns, and teachers have been dispatched from Taunggyi to teach countryside children, to help bring up the next generation."
shan.11.a: "Great!"

shan.12.t: "Opium Profits"
shan.12.d: "Opium has given our economy a bit of a boost, as the first profits from taxing and limiting opium have arrived. However, the limit has created more problems, namely the selling of increased amounts opium illegally on the black market. People have also become less productive, due to a number of people regularly being high on opium at work. Officials and policemen are trying to crack down on the black market, but no great success has been achieved. However, we have certainly received benefits from our actions."
shan.12.a: "Concerning, but a definite improvement."

shan.13.t: "Inaction Against Opium"
shan.13.d: "The opium trade has been as prolific as ever, with little to no disturbance from the government. People have gone to work while high on opium, and productivity has decreased due to the drug. However, there have been benefits - drug traders are no longer hostile to the government after their inaction, and we have eliminated possible enemies to the North."
shan.13.a: "Let's hope it was the right choice."

shan.14.t: "The Resistance of the Drug Traders"
shan.14.d: "After the illegal opium traders were rounded up, put on trial, and thrown in prison, many other drug traders have gone underground. Drug prices have gone up, and the traders are trying to avoid the eye of the law in much more craftier ways. However, a temporary solution has been reached - the police have cracked down on any illegal drug traders reported with sums of money given to anyone who reports illegal drug traders as a reward."
shan.14.a: "Damn those drug lords!"

shan.15.t: "The Great Football Riots"
shan.15.d: ""

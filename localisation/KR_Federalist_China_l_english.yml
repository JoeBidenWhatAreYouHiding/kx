### Decisions ###

UPC_mopping_up:0 "Dealing with Separatists"
UPC_mopping_up_desc:0 "China's periphery has always been more loosely integrated into the central government and have a violent history of uprisings, ethnic tensions, and separatism. During the Civil War, a couple of states attempted to break away from the Central Government and declared their independence. While few in China want to recognize them, reintegrating them may be more difficult than it is worth just to appease Han chauvinist attitudes. Either way, we must make a decision whether to recognize them or reel them back."

UPC_retake_periphery:0 "[FROM.GetFlag] Crush [FROM.GetAdjective] Separatists"
UPC_retake_periphery_desc:0 "[UPC_crush_separatist_tag]"

UPC_crush_separatist_MON:0 "Outer Mongolia was lost back in 1911 and our Republic's founder was one of the many voices demanding an expedition to retake it by force at the time. We cannot accept their terrible regime in our periphery; the Mongolian people itself should be in charge, and we can give it to them without our Federation."
UPC_crush_separatist_MAN:0 "The Northeast Provinces were snatched away from us from dastardly imperialists while we conducted our democratic revolution. As a core part of China, we must reconquer the lost frontier and liberate its people from their foreign puppet master."
UPC_crush_separatist_TAN:0 "The Kumul Khanate is an anachronism, and that is putting it nicely. Leftovers from a bygone era, dedicated to the Manchu Monarchy that we finally rid ourselves of once and for all. Their remnants will be destroyed, and the region will finally see freedom and modernity instead of serfdom, oppression and backwardness."
UPC_crush_separatist_ETS:0 "The religious fundamentalists of Xinjiang, fueled by ethnic separatism, are a stain to China's honour. We cannot trust the Uyghur to be fair and just watchmen of the Northwestern frontier, for they are drunk on ethnic nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism in a multicultural land. It will be a difficult task, but Xinjiang must be reintegrated."

UPC_deal_with_separatists:0 "[FROM.GetFlag] Negotiate with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
UPC_deal_with_separatists_desc:0 "[UPC_deal_with_separatists_tag]"

UPC_deal_with_separatist_MON:0 "Outer Mongolia was lost back in 1911. Even if our Republic's founder was one of the many voices calling for a military expedition to retake the autonomy, it is high time to accept the fact that the Outer Mongolians do not want to be part of the Federal Republic. Surely, it is time to start anew, as their twinkling democracy should be a brethren in Asia and not an enemy out of nothing but selfish pride."
UPC_deal_with_separatist_ETS:0 "Recognizing East Turkestan will be a tough pill to swallow for Xinjiang has been part of China for centuries. Still, if they will not become part of the United Provinces, do we really have an excuse to subjugate them against their will? Surely, their young Republic can become a fellow Asian democracy. Besides, a military expedition would be a hellish adventure considering the distances, poor infrastructure, and fierce militants opposing us."

UPC_reconstruction_plan:0 "Reconstruction Plan"
UPC_reconstruction_plan_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Plan is the brainchild of Chen Jiongming and the China Public Interest (Zhigong) Party. In the 1920s, the Federalist leader envisioned a country reunified peacefully between the Zhili and Fengtian-dominated North and Kuomintang-dominated South, but this failed, and he instead focused on identifying the causes of the First Republic and the Kuomintang regime's downfall, why neither could solve China's problems, and how to solve said-problems. This included a zealous program of public works, increased central-provincial cooperation, and demilitarization to fund it all.\n\nWith China reunited, we can begin rebuilding it into a great power equal to the West."

UPC_guangzhou-nanning:0 "Guangzhou-Nanning Railway"
UPC_guangzhou-nanning_desc:0 "Guangxi, partly due to its rough terrain and partly due to its relative isolation, is poorly connected with the rest of the country. In order to better integrate Guangdong's sister province and prevent the return of banditry and corruption, a railway connecting Guangzhou and Nanning will be built."
UPC_improve_hainan:0 "Hainan Mining Expansion"
UPC_improve_hainan_desc:0 "The island of Hainan's economic potential has long been neglected. With new mining technologies and a stable government with a drive for investment, we can rectify this and expand iron mining operations."
UPC_nanning-guiyang:0 "Railway to Guizhou"
UPC_nanning-guiyang_desc:0 "Guizhou is one of the poorer provinces in the south, but has potential with proper investment. Connecting the province to the growing railway network is the first step towards the goal of brining prosperity to more remote corners of the country."
UPC_guiyang-kunming:0 "Extend Line to Kunming"
UPC_guiyang-kunming_desc:0 "Yunnan is mountainous and remote, making its integration a difficult process and infrastructure projects expensive. Nevertheless, we must connect it and its bountiful resources to the country."
UPC_guiyang-chengdu:0 "Connecting Sichuan"
UPC_guiyang-chengdu_desc:0 "Sichuan is one of the southern provinces with significant support for the Federalist cause. Yet, due to its numerous conflicts between its regional cliques and the famine, it is in dire need of help. While the Yangtze has traditionally kept it connected with the east, improving its infrastructure and joining it with the railway network will be able to improve our ability to supply the province and prevent another famine by expanding the amount of freight we can move in and out of Sichuan."
UPC_guangzhou-changsha:0 "Expand the Guangzhou-Wuhan Line"
UPC_guangzhou-changsha_desc:0 "The Guangzhou-Wuhan Line is the most important railway in the south, connecting the economic capital of the south with the distant Beijing. Expanding the line between Guangzhou and Changsha will help better connect with our friends in Hunan and allow us to move north and maintain important supply links with any operations outside of the south."
UPC_guangzhou-fujian:0 "Railway to Fujian"
UPC_guangzhou-fujian_desc:0 "Southeastern China is poor and neglected, but Chen Jiongming, as brief governor of Fujian, has a history with the region and hopes to rekindle his old promises to the people of the province. Connecting it with the railway network will allow better communication and transport in one of the south's rougher regions."
UPC_connect_coast:0 "Connect the Southeast"
UPC_connect_coast_desc:0 "While the northern part of Southeastern China is connected with the north, it is not connected with the south. Building this connection will give us a secure route towards Nanjing and an alternative to the route through Wuhan."
UPC_changsha-nanjing:0 "From Guangzhou to Nanjing"
UPC_changsha-nanjing_desc:0 "Nanjing is the most important city on the east-central part of China still under Chinese hands. Improving the rail link between it and Guangzhou will both help with supply and transport and prove our ability as nation-builders by improving the connection between two of the most important cities of China."
UPC_wuhan_bridge:0 "Bridging the Yangtze"
UPC_wuhan_bridge_desc:0 "There is no bridge over the Yangtze in Wuhan, meaning that train wagons have to be ferried across the mighty river. The construction of a rail bridge there has been long considered, but has, thus far, been far too ambitious to complete. Such a feat of engineering, however, has become possible, if expensive. The future Wuhan Yangtze Great Bridge will not merely be a prestige project, but a marvel of engineering that will finally properly connect and unite North and South China, plugging one of the most problematic gaps of the country's infrastructure."
UPC_wuhan-beijing:0 "Modernize the Beijing-Wuhan Railway"
UPC_wuhan-beijing_desc:0 "The connection between Wuhan, the centre of the Revolution, and Beijing, the old northern capital, is as important as the connection with Nanjing or Guangzhou. The line must be modernised and expanded as the amount of freight needed to be transported through it continues to increase."
UPC_connect_northwest:0 "Connect the Northwest"
UPC_connect_northwest_desc:0 "The northwestern provinces have long been isolated and rather independent for centuries. Railways have long promised to bridge the extreme distances between the populated coast and the remote frontier, but only now have we finally had the opportunity to finally connect east and west."
UPC_connect_xinjiang:0 "Reach Xinjiang"
UPC_connect_xinjiang_desc:0 "Naturally, with our railway network reaching the northwestern provinces, the next goal is to reach the even more remote Xinjiang. We cannot allow the region to fall to bandits, rebels, corruption, and foreign imperialists ever again, and a railway to the most remote region of China is the first step in the final integration of China's frontier."

UPC_foreign_policy:0 "Federal Foreign Policy"
UPC_foreign_policy_desc:0 "The United Provinces of China is the uncontested central government of China and is on the way towards modernization and prosperity. However, we are fairly isolated and there remain several unequal treaties with other powers. If China is to become a great power, these treaties must be reppealed and new treaties signed on the basis of equality of nations. This will be a tough task to do so peacefully, but the Century of Humiliation must end!"

UPC_reppeal_unequal_treaties:0 "Repeal Unqual Treaties"
UPC_reppeal_unequal_treaties_desc:0 "It is time for China to reassert herself as a Great Power in her own right. We, from now on, shall be treated as equals. No more unequal treaties! Let us end the Century of Humiliation!"

UPC_trade_treaty:0 "Offer Treaty to [FROM.GetNameDef]"
UPC_trade_treaty_desc:0 "The imperialists in [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to accept the new reality that China is to be independent once and for all. We should renew our offer, and perhaps we can put their petty insult behind us as we work for China to be treated as an equal, lest they cling to their colonial attitudes."

### Scripted localization ###

UPC_CZGP_tang_actually_made_it_holy_shit:0 "\n\nChen Qiyou was the initial favourite to succeed the party's founder, promising to maintain course and zealously implement the Reconstruction Plan. However, Tang Jiyao, the co-founder of the party, has made his move. With his clique behind him, he spoke out against \"obvious foreign influences\" and radicalism that stank of the \"treacherous Kuomintang\". It appears that he may be able to maneuvre his way to the chairmanship by appealing to the moderates."
UPC_CZGP_tang_didnt_make_it_duh:0 "\n\nChen Qiyou, as the favourite of both the majority of the party and Chen Jiongming himself, was quickly swept in by the Party Congress as the second Chairman of the CZGP. He reaffirmed his commitment to the Reconstruction Plan and continue the policy of a concensus government, with the CZGP leading a broad coalition of republicans."

UPC_DC_tang_actually_made_it_and_hes_really_desperate_lmao:0 "\n\nWith his failed bid to lead the Federalists, Tang Jiyao left the CZGP and joined the Democratic Constitutionalists instead, making a final bid for leadership of the young republic and adding a third potential candidate. Few believe his sincerity at this point, but he is also pragmatic and his name is attached with the Federalists' victory and could bring the Party a much-needed big-name to stand for elections.\n\nThe three men are known to be pragmatic, which would be useful as the position of Chief Executive is relatively weak, subordinated to the National Assembly."
UPC_DC_tang_didnt_make_it_duh:0 "Both men have a good reputation as pragmatic politicians and skilled diplomats and could be good leaders for the fairly-weak position of Chief Executive."

UPC_Restore_The_Senate:0 "Restore the Senate"
UPC_Restore_The_Senate_desc:0 "The Republic of China, from the Xinhai Revolution until the Qing Restoration, had a Senate as the upper house of the National Assembly.

UPC_First_Draft_Of_The_Constitution_desc:0 "The first draft of the future constitution is essentially an expansion of the 1924 Constitution, which has been used provisionally until now.

UPC_A_New_Legal_Code_desc:0 "While significantly reformed after their Restoration, the Great Qing Legal Code has been in force for almost three centuries and the First Republic was unsuccessful in replacing it. This will be a long and difficult process, but the drafting and implementation of a modern legal code is a priority for the new Federal Government as a way to finally move away from the Old China."
UPC_Fight_Against_Corruption:0 "Fight Against Corruption"
UPC_Fight_Against_Corruption_desc:0 "Corruption is endemic throughout China and rooting it out and preventing it is a permanent process. We must take a firm stance against it to prove that the New China will be a better one for the people."

UPC_Eliminate_The_Warlords_desc:0 "Warlordism has brought chaos, destruction and enduring pain to the Chinese people. It must be rooted out once and for all, otherwise China cannot modernize and the people cannot be free. The Warlords will submit - or be destroyed."
UPC_Crack_Down_On_Opium:0 "Crack Down On Opium"
UPC_Crack_Down_On_Opium_desc:0 "Opium has been a plague for a century. The Century of Humiliation can only end when the drug has been eradicated. Fighting addiction will be a long process and fighting its trade an expensive one, but it must be done or China will linger in poverty and moral degradation."
UPC_Reform_The_Judiciary:0 "Reform the Judiciary"
UPC_Reform_The_Judiciary_desc:0 "While the First Republic did introduce an independent judiciary and courts, the weak Ministry of Justice was overshadowed by a powerful Interior Ministry. Judicial independence should be true in reality, not just on paper, to provide the people with justice and legal protection fit for the powerful country China should be."
UPC_Modern_Legal_System:0 "Modern Legal System"
UPC_Modern_Legal_System_desc:0 "A legal code and independent judiciary are merely part of a modern legal system, but they will be its main pillars. Legal malpractice and abuse can be eliminated if modern legalism can take hold in Chinese society and help bring justice to a people long-oppressed."
UPC_Restructure_The_Bureaucracy:0 "Restructure the Bureaucracy"
UPC_Restructure_The_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "The Guangzhou Federal Government previously only controlled the southern provinces and it was already stretched thin from governing only Guangdong.

UPC_Reform_The_Currency_System:0 "Reform the Currency System"
UPC_Reform_The_Currency_System_desc:0 "Currency in China is a complete mess. While a modern system was introduced in the early 1900s, the anarchy of the Warlord era led to a number of provincial, national and foreign currency with various exchange rates circulating. With our government firmly in control, it is time to enforce a single national currency minted from a central bank, the Federal Reserve Bank of China."
UPC_Financial_Reform:0 "Financial Reform"
UPC_Financial_Reform_desc:0 "Finances are a difficult topic indeed and the high levels of corruption only make it worse. The Federalists have been pushing for greater financial transparency and separation of Central and Provincial finances since the foundation of the Public Interest Party. It is now time for them to implement their policy to the government and hopefully bring economic stability to China."
UPC_Fiscal_Reform:0 "Fiscal Reform"
UPC_Fiscal_Reform_desc:0 "Revenue is difficult to control in a country as large and corrupt as China. Reforms are sorely needed to modernize taxation and move away from questionable income sources such as gambling monopolies and exorbitant or unfair taxation. When stable revenue can be guaranteed, the government will be able to invest funds to help rebuild the devastated nation."
UPC_China_Reconstruction_Plan:0 "China Reconstruction Plan"
UPC_China_Reconstruction_Plan_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Plan is Chen Jiongming's brainchild from the mid-1920s onward which outlined his ideals and plan to reunify and rebuild the nation. Through social, political, and economic reform, China can not only recover from Warlordism and Imperialism, but become a great power equal to any of the great western powers."
UPC_Set_Up_Provincial_Assemblies:0 "Set Up Provincial Assemblies"
UPC_Set_Up_Provincial_Assemblies_desc:0 "Local democracy has been snuffed by warlords, corrupt politicians and monarchists. Provincial governments should adopt constitutions and create democratic institutions on county- and provincial-levels and help reintroduce old traditions of local self-government. In the end, this will help the people, still largely illiterate, understand democracy and give it stronger foundations on a national level."
UPC_Delineate_Provincial_Powers:0 "Delineate Provincial Powers"
UPC_Delineate_Provincial_Powers_desc:0 "Separation of powers is important to create a solid foundation for democracy. To the Federalists, ensuring that the powers of the central and provincial governments are clearly defined to avoid conflict. Chen Jiongming, in his writing, vagueness in power separation as one of the major problems behind the fall of the First Republic, and clear language in the new Constitution will help alleviate inter-institutional conflicts."
UPC_Governor_Elections:0 "Governor Elections"
UPC_Governor_Elections_desc:0 "The appointment of governors is in dire need of reform as Warlordism showed all too clearly. The Federalists have generally supported for governors and county magistrates to be directly elected by the people, while Guangdong adopted indirect elections, believing that lingering corrupt and feudal influences were still too strong. Either way the process must be reformed to encourage democratization."
UPC_Concessions_To_The_Landowners:0 "Concessions to the Landowners"
UPC_Concessions_To_The_Landowners_desc:0 "While land reform is a necessity, it must be enacted within the bounds of the law and will never be possible without the support, or at least consent, of the landowners themselves. A compromise is therefore necessary, and the gentry will either be compensated or given concessions to ensure their continued support of more pressing political decisions."
UPC_Good_Business_Relations:0 "Good Business Relations"
UPC_Good_Business_Relations_desc:0 "The government will need to encourage investment from wealthy individuals and organizations in order to bring the tall task of rebuilding China to a successful conclusion.

UPC_Support_Farmer_Unions:0 "Support Farmer Unions"
UPC_Support_Farmer_Unions_desc:0 "The peasants make up the absolute majority of the population. It is only reasonable that we support their wellbeing and prosperity over those of the already-wealthy landowners. Chen Jiongming encouraged unionization among both urban and rural populations, believing unions to be essential for the peasants to express their grievances and settle land and labour disputes."
UPC_Land_To_The_Tiller:0 "Land to the Tiller"
UPC_Land_To_The_Tiller_desc:0 "The Land to the Tiller program is one of reasonable land reform that will benefit both peasants and landowners. Of course, implementing is easier said and done and it will certainly be costly, but is the way to both modernize the agrarian economy of China and reduce poverty among the cripplingly-poor peasants of the country."
UPC_Self_Organisation_For_Workers:0 "Self Organisation for Workers"
UPC_Self_Organisation_For_Workers_desc:0 "Unionization was encouraged under Chen Jiongming's governorship of Guangdong and they had a place in the provincial government.

UPC_First_Federal_Elections:0 "First Federal Elections"
UPC_First_Federal_Elections_desc:0 "With the constitution ratified, the Provisional Government has done its work and elections have been called. This will be the second free nationwide election in Chinese history and will be the first test for the newborn Federal Republic.

UPC_The_New_Foreign_Ministry:0 "The New Foreign Ministry"
UPC_The_New_Foreign_Ministry_desc:0 "With a new cabinet in place comes the reorganization of the Foreign Ministry.

lngupc.1.d:0 "The First and Second Shantou Conferences of 1924 were an assembly of federalists from across China to discuss the future of the movement and the country. Notably, the second one was attended by delegates from both the Kuomintang and the Beijing Government despite their ongoing conflict. Chen Jiongming will now host a third conference, hoping to bring the southern provincial governments together to agree on a new Reconstruction Plan for the region and form a provisional government to rival the Beijing and Fengtian governments and the Kuomintang upstarts. Once more, the strength of the Federalist movement is on the upswing and there is a real chance for it to become influential in national politics."
lngupc.1.a:0 "Towards unity."

lngupc.101.t:0 "Beginning of the Conference"
lngupc.101.d:0 "Governor Chen Jiongming, chairman of the China Public Interest Party, opened the conference stating that Southern China was in a unique position once again, and that the Federalist movement could prove themselves to the rest of China as models for true democracy and prosperity. [GXC.GetTangStatus]. Zhao Hengti reiterated his statement from 1922 that the only way to unite China is to build a federalized, unified nation. Notably, there are a number of delegates from outside the Federalist movement observing the Conference like the first two. After the opening statements, the delegates begin discussing Chen Jiongming's Reconstruction Plan and the possibility of forming a new National Government."
lngupc.101.a:0 "Get on with it!"

lngupc.102.t:0 "Tang's Course of Action"
lngupc.102.d:0 "As the Conference drags on, Governor Tang is becoming uneasy. Chen Jiongming's Reconstruction Plan would severely weaken his position within the movement and in Yunnan itself, and while he had previously agreed to it back in 1924, the leader of Yunnan has become ambitious over the years. As deputy chairman of the Chen's Public Interest Party, Tang is in a position to oppose the more radical proposals of the party chairman.\n\nIt is becoming clear that the chairman and deputy chairman are no longer in complete agreement, and Tang is seeing his chance to usurp the Federalism movement from Chen. To do so, however, would go against the majority of the Public Interest Party and break the movement altogether. However, the idea of attaining national leadership is an attractive one, and may be worth the risk of a war with Liangguang."

The Conference then elect him as Provisional Chief Executive of the United Provincial Government, promptly announcing another conference to draft a provisional constitution for the Federalist government.\n\nWhile Southern China has been de facto outside the control of the Beijing Government since February 1936, this declaration formally announced the creation of a rival republican government in the South.

Tang's betrayal is quickly denounced and the rest of the delegates accept the Reconstruction Plan. Chen Jiongming reads out the conference's decision, declaring that [QIE.GetNameDef] to be illegitimate and the formation of a new national government in Guangzhou: The United Provinces of the Republic of China.

lngupc.2.d:0 "With his position secure in Liangguang, Chen Jiongming has invited us to the [GetConferenceCity] Conference. We attended the first two conferences in 1924 as members of the Federalist movement, which led to mixed results as our movement failed to end the war between the North and South. We expect that, this time, Chen Jiongming is aiming to form a new national government based on his ideals for a democratic and federal China, which he believes is the only way for the Chinese people to be free and prosperous.\n\nIf we are to attend and agree to his Reconstruction Plan, it is clear that we will eventually have adopt a federalist constitution, transfer power to an elected assembly, and, more importantly, have our armies absorbed into a central command.

Three potential cities were narrowed down: Nanjing, formerly the capital of the Ming Dynasty and provisional capital of the First Republic before Yuan Shikai's usurpation, has significant value among nationalists and republicans; Wuhan, where the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing for the first time began, is valued by more revolutionary-minded people; or Guangzhou, current provisional capital and, of course, centre of our power base valued by the Federalists."

There are plenty who want to restore the flag of the First Republic, the Five-coloured flag, as a symbol of national unity. Many revolutionaries, however, wish to avoid connections with the corrupt Beiyang, Fengtian, and Zhili warlord regimes, and the party flag of the Public Interest Party (the white \"jing\" symbol on a blue canton on a red field) has grown in popularity along with the Federalist movement's continued successes."

lngupc.9.d:0 "The National Conference has made the final vote; the Constitution has been promulgated! With their work completed, the Conference will be disbanded when the National Assembly is elected.\n\nThe Constitution of the United Provinces of China (or Federal Republic) is largely based on the 1924 Constitution of the Republic of China. Its main differences lay on the organization of the Republic and its government, which is based on the United States. The powers of the central and provincial governments are more clearly defined. The main administrative unit of the Republic is the Province and the Province's is the County, and each are self-governing. Each province is to have their own constitution, which cannot conflict with the Federal one, drafted and adopted by representatives of its people. The Zongzhizheng (Chief Executive) is the Head of State and is responsible to the National Assembly while executive power is vested in the Cabinet. The National Assembly has two chambers: The Lower House is the House of Representatives elected by the people, and the Upper House is the Senate elected by the provincial governments.\n\nIn short, China is to become a federal parliamentary republic. It is hoped that with this new constitution will lead to a better, stable and united China where democracy can finally take hold."
lngupc.9.a:0 "Long live the Federal Republic!"

lngupc.10.t:0 "The Senate and Interim Government"
lngupc.10.d:0 "Members of the Senate have been elected by the Provincial governments to represent them, forming the upper house of the legislature. Their first act was to elect the first Chief Executive of the United Provinces, and they unanimously chose Chen Jiongming, already the provisional head of state.\n\nWhile initially reluctant, Chen accepted the position, only to announce his retirement from politics after his term. From then on, as envisioned by the Reconstruction Plan, the Chief Executive would be elected by the people."
lngupc.10.a:0 "Provincial representation guaranteed."

lngupc.11.t:0 "Third Congress of the Public Interest Party"
lngupc.11.d:0 "With the future of China in their hands, the China Zhigongdang, or Public Interest Party, have held a new congress to decide the next chairman after an exhausted Chen Jiongming bid farewell to politics.[UPC_CZGP_congress_loc]"
lngupc.11.a:0 "Chen Qiyou, naturally."
lngupc.11.b:0 "Tang Jiyao, a major surprise."

lngupc.12.t:0 "Congress of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party"
lngupc.12.d:0 "The Democratic Constitutionalist Party is, loosely speaking, a descendent of the Progressive Party of the First Republic. It was founded in exile after Yuan Shikai's fall and remained largely irrelevant. With democracy returning to China, the party is seeing a renaissance, embracing a new role as representatives of the recently-liberated north and dispersed conservative politicians. Two major candidates stand for the chairmanship: Yan Huiqing, politician of the First Republic and respected diplomat from the Anhui and Zhili cliques, and Hu Shih, another diplomat and distinguished essayist and philosopher. [UPC_DC_congress_loc]"
lngupc.12.a:0 "Yan Huiqing and the Zhili remnants."
lngupc.12.b:0 "Tang Jiyao; take advantage of his name."
lngupc.12.c:0 "The pragmatic Hu Shih."

lngupc.13.t:0 "Congress of the China Democratic League"
lngupc.13.d:0 "The China Democratic League is a broad coalition of liberal intellectual throughout. With China's reunification, the League welcomed the Rural Reconstruction Party, which participated in Qing parliamentary politics before the Monarchy's overthrow, to its coalition along with other small liberal movements.\n\nZhang Junmai, an avowed social-democrat in the Western style, remains at the head of the League. The liberal coalition's main goal is to ensure the new Republic continues to uphold civil liberties with a focus on education reform and modernization."
lngupc.13.a:0 "Zhang Junmai will lead the centrists."

lngupc.14.t:0 "Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party"
lngupc.14.d:0 "The Kuomintang have struggled since their second defeat. Thanks largely to Chen Jiongming's cooperation with Chen Mingshu's Productive People's Party, the Nationalist Party has been able to survive through the storm. With the country reunited, the Central Committee disbanded the PPP and held a new party congress to decide on the future.\n\nIt was quickly decided to renounce revolutionary methods and recognize the Federal Government. Song Qingling quickly consolidated her position as chairwoman of the Nationalist Party, stating she was willing to work with the Public Interest Party to promote Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles and continue the fight for its application in the National Assembly. The Kuomintang has become a true political party participating in parliamentary politics."
lngupc.14.a:0 "Song Qingling will continue Sun's legacy."

lngupc.15.t:0 "Congress of the Chinese Syndicalist Party"
lngupc.15.d:0 "With its alliance with the Kuomintang ended, the Chinese Syndicalist Party held its own congress to decide its future. As the Chinese urban proletariat remains small, the Syndicalists have made it their objective to ensure that the Federal Government maintains its pro-union stance and called for the creation of a federation of trade unions to unite China's numerous trade unions and ensure proper representation of workers. Chen Duxiu remains at the head of the CSP, with the party likely to remain fringe and largely uninfluential."
lngupc.15.a:0 "Chen Duxiu holds the far-left."

lngupc.16.t:0 "The Beginnings of Democracy"
lngupc.16.d:0 "With several major democratic parties actively participating in the electoral process, the idea of democracy taking hold in China appears more realistic than previously expected. Debates are civilized, if sometimes energetic and emotional, and there seem to be little signs of obstruction in proceedings. Of course, many were optimistic during the 1912 National Assembly Election, only for the winner, Song Jiaoren of the Kuomintang, to be assassinated. Only time will tell as the upcoming election will be the first test of Chinese democracy since the 1910s."
lngupc.16.a:0 "With cautious optimism, we look to the future."

lngupc.17.t:0 "Chen Jiongming's Offer"
lngupc.17.d:0 "Once merely the governor of Guangdong, Chen Jiongming's Federalist movement has become a veritable force in China and is potentially on its way to becoming a serious contender for national leadership. An emissary from the so-called United Provinces of the Republic of China, Chen's government, appeared with a request: Join the United Provinces in overthrowing the decadent and corrupt [QIE.GetName] and restore the Republic and Constitution.\n\nThe message does include demands and a final threat: [Root.GetLeader] must abide to Chen Jiongming's so-called Reconstruction Plan, which would require us to adopt a constitution and delegate the majority of our powers to an elected assembly while our armies would be integrated into the United Provinces', essentially depriving us of political power. In exchange, [GetAdjective] officers would maintain their rank in the federalist army, with [Root.GetLeader] promised a command.\n\nShould we refuse, the message makes it clear that Chen Jiongming is willing to use force to \"help the [GetAdjective] people overthrow their illegal warlord regime and restore democracy.\""
lngupc.17.a:0 "We accept; for China!"
lngupc.17.b:0 "We will not submit to this upstart!"

lngupc.18.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] Submits!"
lngupc.18.d:0 "The leader of [From.GetNameDef] has accepted our demands. His armies are now under our control and his provincial government will put the Reconstruction Plan into effect. We are one step closer towards unifying China under federalist leadership."
lngupc.18.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

lngupc.19.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] Rejects Our Demands"
lngupc.19.d:0 "Unwilling to cooperate with our government and enact our Reconstruction Plan, the leader of [FROM.GetNameDef] defiantly rejected our demands. We will have to resort to force to overthrow their illegal warlord regime and bring the people to power."
lngupc.19.a:0 "They will regret this."

lngupc.20.t:0 "Federalists Mobilizing Against Us"
lngupc.20.d:0 "Chen Jiongming and his treacherous band of counter-revolutionaries have mobilized their warlord forces against us, seeking to destroy the National Revolution. We will never forget his betrayal of the Nationalist cause before the Northern Expedition- We have defeated him once, and we will defeat him again."
lngupc.20.a:0 "They dare spit on Sun Yat-sen's legacy!"

lngupc.21.t:0 "Delegation from the Federalists"
lngupc.21.d:0 "Chen Jiongming's rival government in Guangzhou, having secured themselves a significant presence in the South, has sent delegates for negotiations. Unwilling to shed further bloodsheds and wanting to reunify the country as painlessly and peacefully as possible. The emissaries made their case that our government should adopt Chen Jiongming's Reconstruction Plan, which would mean that our provinces would send delegates to Chen's National Conference. This assembly would hammer out a new Federal Constitution based on the 1924 Constitution and an economic plan to rebuild the country. This would, however, submit all our military forces to this new civilian federal government, practically robbing us of significant bargaining power in Chen's Federal Republic.\n\nNegotiations quickly broke down as the Federalists refused to allow our Marshall to remain head of the reunified Chinese military or to adjust the powers of the President. The delegates left bitterly disappointed and we can only expect their rebellious armies to march against us."
lngupc.21.a:0 "Foolish rebels."

lngupc.211.t:0 "Negotiations Break Down with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
lngupc.211.d:0 "Our delegates have returned bitterly disappointed. [FROM.GetLeader] refused to adopt Chen's Reconstruction Plan and attempts at compromise failed, seemingly unwilling to avoid more bloodshed among countrymen in order to preserve their thinly-veiled dictatorships. We will have to overthrow the militarists by force."
lngupc.211.a:0 "Foolish militarists."

lngupc.22.t:0 "Federalists Mobilizing Against Us"
lngupc.22.d:0 "Chen Jiongming and his treacherous band of republicans and self-proclaimed revolutionaries have mobilized their rebel forces against us. Unsurprisingly, they are unwilling to be reasonable, dead-set on overthrowing the Emperor and bringing another era of anarchy to the Empire. We can expect them to attack us soon, and we will destroy the anarchist when he tries to march north."
lngupc.22.a:0 "He never should've been restored to Guangdong."

lngupc.23.t:0 "Implementing the Reconstruction Plan"
lngupc.23.d:0 "While we have been working on its preliminary implementation since we joined Chen Jiongming's Federalist movement, the new Federal Government has made it official as its first act. We will soon be invited to the National Conference, where details of a new Constitution will be decided.\n\nUnlike the last two Republican constitutions, this one will clearly determine the powers of the Chief Executive (head of state), the cabinet, the legislature, the Federal and Provincial governments, and so on. Essentially, the Provisional Government is expected to model itself after the United States of America while taking into account its recent failings and, of course, the particularities of China. After a Constitution is adopted and Senate (representing the Provinces) is formed, elections will be organized for the National Assembly.\n\nUntil the National Conference opens, as part of the Plan, we can expect help from the Provisional Government in infrastructure projects to help rebuild the national economy."
lngupc.23.a:0 "Help? From the Central Government?"

lngupc.24.t:0 "Invitation to the National Conference"
lngupc.24.d:0 "The National Conference, as agreed in the Reconstruction Plan, is to draft the new Constitution of the Republic, form a Senate to represent the provinces of China, and create a new Central Government along democratic, federalist ideals. Our part of the country will be an integral part of the reborn Chinese nation."
lngupc.24.a:0 "A new China rises."

lngupc.25.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Attends the National Conference"
lngupc.25.d:0 "Among the representatives of [FROM.GetNameDef] is [FROM.GetLeader] joining us at the National Conference. Their support in the reconstruction of China will prove instrumental and we welcome them with open arms!"
lngupc.25.a:0 "Welcome, brother!"

lngupc.26.t:0 "Diplomatic Overtures from [FROM.GetNameDef]"
lngupc.26.d:0 "Ever since we have gained our independence, China, regardless of its successive governments, continues to claim our lands as part of their country. While this was hardly a problem when the Chinese continued to squabble among each other, a new Chinese government has risen from the ashes and reunified the country, which is now at its strongest in recent memory.\n\nHowever, it appears that [FROM.GetLeader] is willing to see reason and compromise. They sent a diplomatic envoy, making clear that they are willing to recognize our independence. In exchange, our nations are to seek closer economic ties for mutual benefits. The Chinese diplomat appears sincere enough with pretty words about our twinkling democracies forming closer ties despite a turbulent past relationship and does not give up hope for further Asian unity in the future."
lngupc.26.a:0 "Let us seek closer relations as equals."
lngupc.26.b:0 "This is merely an act to exploit us again!"

lngupc.27.t:0 "Diplomatic Relations Established with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
lngupc.27.d:0 "Our diplomat was successful. In exchange for recognition of their independence, we have signed a mutually-beneficial trade agreement as the basis for future relations and regional cooperation."
lngupc.27.a:0 "For a better future with fellow Asians."

lngupc.28.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Rejected Our Proposal"
lngupc.28.d:0 "Our diplomat was unsuccessful. They have made clear that they will not accept anything more than recognition of their independence and that any trade deal would only reopen their country to Chinese dominance. Their insult has been noted."
lngupc.28.a:0 "This is ridiculous!"

lngupc.29.t:0 "First National Assembly Election"
lngupc.29.d:0 "The first free elections of the Chinese Republic since the 1910s have finally arrived. Millions of Chinese will go to the polls, the vast majority for the first time in their lives, to vote for their preferred candidate or political party. This will reflect well on the country and its people regardless of the results."

We expect a bigger turnout rate than the previous election thanks to improving public education and infrastructure across China. Our burgeoning democracy is getting the attention of the whole world as we prove ourselves capable of greater civic responsibility than they ever expected. The Chinese people can be proud to cast their votes in free and fair election unknown in this part of the world."

lngupc.31.d:0 "With intensified anti-imperialist rhetoric, [FROM.GetLeader] has made it clear that our uncertain status cannot be maintained any longer. While the municipalities under our control are guaranteed to have autonomy under the Chinese Constitution, we are to be returned to direct control of the Chinese Federal Government with the Unequal Treaties declared null and void."

lngupc.32.a:0 "Put up a token resistance, then surrender."
lngupc.32.b:0 "We will fight them!"

lngupc.320.t:0 "Portugal Surrenders Macau!"
lngupc.320.d:0 "Excellent news! Portuguese forces, facing our overwhelming superiority, surrendered control of Macau soon after our attack began. We allowed them to return home unmolested, and now the city is ours!"

lngupc.33.d_LEC:0 "The [From.GetName] have long considered our status illegitimate, and while we had hoped Canada would provide protection against any revanchist activity from the Chinese government, it seems they have taken Canada's current military struggles as an opportunity to attempt to try and retake the Legations. We must petition Canada for aid and hope they are not too distracted!"
lngupc.33.a:0 "Telegram Ottawa at once!"

lngupc.330.t:0 "China Threatens Our Eastern Interests!"

lngupc.331.d:0 "[CAN.GetName] formally told [UPC_leader.Capital.GetName] that they will protect us against any military incursion! While the United Provinces of China has a powerful army, their navy is rather lackluster, and most experts agree they would never dare challenge the Canadian fleet."
lngupc.331.a:0 "Huzzah!"

lngupc.332.t:0 "Canada Steps In!"
lngupc.332.d:0 "The Canadian government announced today that they would take any action necessary to protect their eastern interests, including military action. It appears they have called our bluff! While their current war leaves them distracted, we are a young power, and would be facing one of the world's most formidable navies..."

lngupc.334.a:0 "Curses!"

lngupc.34.d:0 "A new Chinese central government rose from the ashes, consolidating itself to the point that it has deluded itself that it can demand the return of all concessions granted to us! This is outrageous, of course, but the instability in the region essentially destroyed our presence in the region and the new Chinese government does have a very large and remarkably competent army."

lngupc.37.a:0 "China, long divided, must be united!"

lngupc.340.t:0 "German Cities are Ceded!"
lngupc.340.d:0 "Even the second archtypical imperialist, the Germans, bowed to pressure! This is a serious diplomatic coup that will restore the Chinese people's self-confidence and clearly demonstrates the success of our peaceful policies."
lngupc.340.a:0 "Great!"

lngupc.341.t:0 "Germany Refuses!"
lngupc.341.d:0 "The Germans, proud imperialists, have refused to bow to pressure despite facing serious issues in Europe. Either we will have to liberate the concessions by force, or back down and continue our policy of unilateral non-recognition of unequal treaties."
lngupc.341.a:0 "Mobilize the troops!"
lngupc.341.b:0 "This is pointless..."

fedchi.100.t:0 "Successful Healthcare Expansion"
fedchi.100.d:0 "The size of the country and limited resources has made the creation of a healthcare service a very difficult and expensive task. However, the Federal Government's initiative is starting to bear fruit as the number of hospitals in cities and clinics in rural areas has increased significantly. The people of China is starting to have access to modern healthcare for the first in history."
fedchi.100.a:0 "Excellent."

fedchi.101.t:0 "Successful Literacy Campaigns"
fedchi.101.d:0 "Education reform are always difficult to implement and judge its success. The Federal Government's efforts to improve literacy, however, by building more schools and giving night classes for workers, has already had a noticeable effect among the populace. Of course, it will take even more time for long-term effects to appear, but the early results are already promising."
fedchi.101.a:0 "Excellent."

fedchi.102.t:0 "Land to the Tiller"
fedchi.102.d:0 "Land reform has been a controversial issue. Not because some disagree (the need for such a program has been nigh-universally acknowledged in China), but because implementing it can either be expensive or violent through expropriations. Regardless, the government's attempt to implement a reasonable land reform without resorting to illegal or violent means is starting to see some real changes in rural areas throughout China. It will take a very long time, but the Land to the Tiller program is slowly redistributing land and compensating landlords, giving a higher rate of peasant land ownership like never before."
fedchi.102.a:0 "Excellent."

fedchi.200.t:0 "China Repeals Unequal Treaties"
fedchi.200.d:0 "The new national government of China, with their position secured, has decided to unilateraly void all unequal treaties. As a way to reassert themselves on the world stage, they invite us to sign an new treaty with them as equals. This would recognize the end of our nationals' extraterritorial rights in China and bring about a mutually-beneficial trade agreement instead of the preferential tariffs and territorial concessions. Refusing this will include trade sanctions with China, which would be disadvantageous as the Chinese government is unwilling to restore the previous treaties that profited us."
fedchi.200.a:0 "Very well, this is a new era."
fedchi.200.b:0 "Impose sanctions instead."

fedchi.201.t:0 "A New Treaty with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
fedchi.201.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted to recognize us as an equal nation and a new trade agreement has been enacted instead. We are one step closer to ending the Century of Humiliation and achieving our place in the world."
fedchi.201.a:0 "Excellent!"

fedchi.203.t:0 "China Proposes Trade Agreement"
fedchi.203.d:0 "When the Chinese government unilateraly ended the unequal treaties, we refused to recognize it and instead enforced sanctions on China. However, this has destroyed trade relations with China and has had little effect on them. China's foreign ministry has repeated their earlier offer of a new treaty with them, seemingly willing to ignore what they perceived as a grave insult to their status as a nation in order to rebuilt relations between our two nations as equals instead of an \"imperialist arragement\"."
fedchi.203.a:0 "Very well."
fedchi.203.b:0 "Never!"

fedchi.204.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Rejects Our Offer"
fedchi.204.d:0 "The imperialists of [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused to sign a new treaty with us, instead clinging to their dying colonial attitudes and continuing sanctions. They will see the consequences of losing access to the Chinese market as we continue to modernize and prosper."
fedchi.204.a:0 "They will regret that insult."

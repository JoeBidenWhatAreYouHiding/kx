GXC_border_raid_decisions: "Border Raids"
GXC_border_raid_decisions_desc: "Guangxi has a history of banditry, one that we may as well use to help improve our equipment stockpile. Our neighbours certainly won't like it, but with China in chaos, they are unlikely to be able to pin the blame us officially thanks to the general confusion.

GXC_secure_south_decisions_desc: "Liangguang is now in a position to establish hegemony over Southern China. Where hostile Cliques are weak and vulnerable, we must strike, and bring them to our fold. Soon enough, we will have uncontested control of this part of China, making us highly influential in national politics."
GXC_secure_south: "[FROM.GetFlag] Secure [FROM.GetCliqueShortName]"

GXC_finding_backers: "Finding Backers"
GXC_finding_backers_desc: "Since the collapse of the League, that status of the Central Government has been confusing at best.

GXC_align_with_zhili: "Align with the Zhili Clique"
GXC_align_with_zhili_desc: "Ma Ji is a personal friend of Wu Peifu, having fought under him during the Kuomintang's failed invasion. His Clique has been supporting us since then, and it is time we repaid our debt to the Jade Marshall and support the Central Government against treachery."

GXC_align_with_japan: "Align with Japan"
GXC_align_with_japan_desc: "With China ravaged by radicalism and warlordism, the economy is guaranteed to fall into shambles once more. Japan, however, is now the key to stability for the country. Chen Lianbo has pro-Japanese sympathies and he believes in their Panasian ideal. After all, they are now the only chance to finally bring peace, and it would be in our best interests to strike a good deal with them first before the Imperial Japanese Army marches into Guangzhou."

GXC_UPC_reunification_decisions: "Federalist Reunification"
GXC_UPC_reunification_decisions_desc: "The time has come. With the United Provinces consolidated, we can now expand our influence in the region by toppling the remaining unruly warlords of Southern China and handing power to the people. When the Republic secures this half of the nation, we will be able to negotiate with the northern militarists and republicans for the reunification of our beloved country."

GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_HNN: "Many in Hunan support Federalism, but their control of the provincial government is not guaranteed. Regardless, its leadership should be given an opportunity to make amends and return power to the Hunanese people."
GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_SZC: "The province of Sichuan has seen terrible blights after terrible blights. Famine, warlords, bandits, and so on. Perhaps the United Provinces can bring stability to the troubled province and restore the people's faith?"
GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_LEP: "There is irony to be noted that we are able to pressure the old leaders of the League that tried to destroy us. While we expect nothing from the so-called League Marshal, it is simply better to extend an olive branch first to show our good faith."
GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_ANQ: "Chen Tiaoyuan is definitely a man to be respected and his anti-concessionist stance is admirable. While we are unsure of his actual character, there is a chance he could be pulled over to our cause and limit bloodshed among countrymen."
GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_SQI: "We expect nothing from the leadership of Shandong. These are merely formalities in the hopes that the poor people of the troubled province knows that we come as the liberators to topple their oppressors."
GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_SHX: "Yan Xishan is a peculiar man to say the least. We certainly cannot say that he is a Federalist, but it is clear that the CZGP has influenced his leadership. Clearly, the pragmatic stateman can see that opposing us would go against what he claims to stand for? Otherwise, we can try to find a settlement with the Guominjun again, as we tried back in 1921."
GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_YUN: "Yunnan is known as a republican stronghold, but its governor may not be wise enough to see our movement as allies. Warlords must be eliminated and power returned to the people."
GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_YUN_tang: "Tang Jiyao was made vice-chairman of the Public Interest Party at its founding, but his allegiance to the movement is questionable. Once we are certain he is loyal, we can bring him into the United Provinces."

In order to limit bloodshed and reunite China as peacefully as possible, cutting a deal with the northern Marshal will be necessary and Chen Jiongming believes that only a North-South settlement will truly bring peace in the country."
GXC_negotiate_with_Zhili: "[QIE.GetFlag] Negotiate with Wu Peifu"
GXC_negotiate_with_Zhili_desc: "While many republicans view the Jade Marshal with extreme suspicion for working with the former Dynasty, Chen Jiongming personally believes that he can appeal to Wu Peifu's patriotism and find a diplomatic settlement, bringing peace to China once and for all."

GXC_guangdong_guangxi_war_decisions_desc: "Also known as the Second Yue-Gui War after the respective provinces' shorthand names, the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi have found themselves at war once more. The first war took place in 1920 between Lu Rongting and Chen Jiongming after the former broke with Sun Yat-sen, which the latter still supported at that point. The war was brief, resulting in Chen Jiongming's forces securing Guangdong for the KMT and Lu Rongting was unable to counter-attack. \n\nThe Liangguang Dyarchy was short-lived, as the leaders of two provinces can no longer see eye-to-eye. The victor may very well decide the future of Southern China, if not the whole country."
GXC_move_quickly: "Fighting for Momentum"

### Ideas ###
GXC_backwards_guangxi: "Guangxi's Struggling Economy"
GXC_backwards_guangxi_desc: "The economy of the province of Guangxi is being sucked dry by the heavy militarization of its governing clique, as most funds are funneled into the provincial military. The rate of military spending has become quite unsustainable and the economy suffers as a result. Additional income sources or serious economic reforms may be required to alleviate the situation."

GXC_AOG_leftovers: "Anti-Concessionist Wave"
GXC_AOG_leftovers_desc: "With Black Monday and the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, the hated AOG, the association of German merchants in China, is in freefall. The German imperialists, seemingly unable to recoup their losses and left in hostile territory, are trying to flee and anti-concessionists in Guangzhou are taking full advantage of it. Rioting may break out soon, which could cause a diplomatic incident if the German presence in the city is attacked. For the time being, Chinese businessmen are happily buying our failed or failing German assets in Southern China, increasing their own influence and power in the region."

GXC_bailing_out_peasants: "Financial Aid for Peasants"
GXC_bailing_out_peasants_desc: "The Provincial Government has taken measures to help rural peasants cope with the ongoing economic crisis."

GXC_bailing_out_merchants: "Bailing out Merchants"
GXC_bailing_out_merchants_desc: "The Provincial Government has taken measures to bail out bankrupted merchants and help them recover from the global economic downturn."

GXC_guangxi_militarism: "Guangxi Militarism"
GXC_guangxi_militarism_desc: "Militarism has been prominent in Guangxi for centuries and the military prowess of its people are well-known throughout China. It is only natural that we are tapping into this powerful situation in order to advance our ambitions."

GXC_militia_corps: "Militia Corps"
GXC_militia_corps_desc: "The term Militia Corps refers to units of militia levied from small towns and villages to serve as anti-bandit forces or, sometimes, as a reserve force. These are typically led and equiped by the local gentry and notable. This means that many people in rural areas have some kind of military experience, expanding our pool of potential recruits."

GXC_militarised_guangxi: "Militarised Guangxi"
GXC_militarised_guangxi_desc: "Guangxi Province has been thoroughly militarized in order to serve the ambitions of the ruling clique. The province only exists to support the provincial forces, as if the army was the state itself."

GXC_roar_of_wolftroops: "Roar of the Wolf Troops"
GXC_roar_of_wolftroops_desc: "The Lang Bing, or Wolf Troops, were a special military unit of the Ming Dynasty comprised of elite troops from the southern provinces, especially Guangxi. They were ferocious and brutal, which was perfect for its intended role of suppressing dissent and foreign raiders. Their legacy lives on along with Guangxi's fearsome reputation of having the best soldiery in China, and the people have embraced that identity."

GXC_mountaineers: "Mountaineer Training"
GXC_mountaineers_desc: "The people of southern China are familiar with its mountains. Naturally, this means that many of our soldiers are already used to the intricacies and dangers of mountain warfare, making us able to create a strong force of mountaineers to defend our homeland."

GXC_factionalism: "Increased Factionalism"
GXC_factionalism_desc: "The collapse of the League of Eight Provinces has created a power vacuum in the region. While Liangguang is being mostly spared from the armed conflict to succeed the League, many factions within the region have taken this as a signal to push their agenda while ambitious men look for any potential openings towards power."

GXC_divided_military: "Divided Military"
GXC_divided_military_desc: "The provincial armies of Guangdong and Guangxi have been independent of each other since the Xinhai Revolution with few exceptions until the Kuomintang's failed revolt. The two armies have yet to form a single unified command structure and this will greatly affect their general performance until this is rectified."

GXC_reforming_guangxi: "Financial Reform in Guangxi"
GXC_reforming_guangxi_desc: "The government has finally taken steps to rectify the abysmal economic situation in Guangxi."

GXC_warlord_economy: "Warlordist Economy"
GXC_warlord_economy_desc: "The economy has only one use: To supply and support the governor's forces. The government is quite unscrupulous about adding revenue to support military spending and this will likely have serious long-term socio-economic consequences as the number of opium and gambling addicts continue to rise, but the army needs money and it needs it now."

GXC_modernising_guangxi: "Modernising Guangxi"
GXC_modernising_guangxi_desc: "The government has taken fruther steps to rectify the abysmal economic situation in Guangxi, which will hopefully lead to a modern economy in the future."

GXC_suppressing_bandits_desc: "Banditry is rampant in Guangxi. Supressing it will be a long and tough process, but it must be done in order to bring back order and safety to the province. Any mondernization attempt is bound to fail if those basic needs of the populace are not fulfilled."

GXC_chinese_sparta_desc: "The moniker \"Sparta of the East\" has become quite popular among western observers and commentators in the foreign quarters and concessions. While most Chinese have no idea what Sparta is, the moniker has been fully embraced by those educated in the West."

GXC_aviation_bureau: "Liangguang Aviation Bureau"
GXC_aviation_bureau_desc: "The two provinces have a small but burgeoning aviation industry. The potential of air power is great, especially in China where few factions have access to it, and the Aviation Bureau has been created in order to train new pilots, mechanics, and help expand the industry to our advantage."

GXC_officer_vanguards_idea: "Officer Vanguards"
GXC_officer_vanguards_idea_desc: "China has almost unlimited manpower, but numbers alone does not necessarily win wars as very few soldiers are educated and even less have military experience. Forming units entirely out of officers, whom have both education and experience, will make sure that we have military units with far superior capabilities over huge armies of conscripts."

GXC_professional_officers: "Professional Officers"
GXC_professional_officers_desc: "China has almost unlimited manpower, but officers are needed to lead these soldiers, usually uneducated peasants conscripted from small towns and villages. We must make sure that our officers are well-trained and educated so that they can lead these men properly instead of wasting them."

GXC_legacy_of_the_army_of_steel_idea: "Legacy of the Army of Steel"
GXC_legacy_of_the_army_of_steel_idea_desc: "The Army of Steel is the nickname of the Kuomintang's Seventh Army during the Northern Expedition. These men, mostly from Guangxi, proved themselves as the most capable soldiers of the south, scoring numerous victories, even while facing the Jade Marshall himself. Despite the KMT's revolution failing, the legacy of the Steel Army lives on."

GXC_reforming_guangdong_one: "Financial Reform in Guangdong"
GXC_reforming_guangdong_one_desc: "Because of encroachment from the A.O.G. for over a decade, the finances of Guangdong Province have been struggling to compensate for the losses they caused. While Chen Jionming has been successful in resurecting the economy after years of mismanagement from the KMT, there is still much to be done to restore the province to its former glory."

GXC_reforming_guangdong_two: "Investing in Guangdong"
GXC_reforming_guangdong_two_desc: "Through investments by the Provincial Government and the economic elite of China, both within and overseas, the economy of Guangdong can not only recover, but prosper!"

GXC_literacy_campaign: "Literacy Campaign"
GXC_literacy_campaign_desc: "It is clear that one of the major reasons why the West is so prosperous is its high literacy rate. Since literacy is abysmally low in China, we can never hope to become equals to the rest of the world until we improve it, or else we will remain inferior to them."

GXC_decentralisation: "Decentralisation"
GXC_decentralisation_desc: "Chen Jiongming is adamant that decentralisation is the best way to govern a country as large as China. Centralisation brings too much power to too few people, which inevitably leads to corruption and autocracy. If China is to be united and prosperous, the division of power between the central government and the provinces, and between the province and the counties, must be clear. Through provincial self-rule, democracy can be introduced to China from the bottom up, and only with democracy can the people of China truly be free."

GXC_land_reform: "Land to the Tiller Program"
GXC_land_reform_desc: "Land reform has been the cornerstone to any revolutionary movement in China, including the Federalists. It is so important to them that its symbol, the Chinese character for a well, is on the flag of the Public Interest Party among others."

GXC_self_management: "Promoting Self-Organisation"
GXC_self_management_desc: "By promoting the self-rule of provinces and counties, democracy can be introduced to China from the bottom-up as a grassroots movement, for there is no way to create democracy from the top-down as the years before the Qing Restoration plainly demonstrated."

GXC_gentry_dominance: "Gentry Dominance"
GXC_gentry_dominance_desc: "In order to secure the support of the rural gentry, a number of concessions have been accorded to them. This may be seen as a betrayal to the peasants of China, their support and political stability was seen as more important for the time being."

The Northern Expedition may have failed, but the KMT remains underground and a powerful force in Liangguang. Chen Mingshu's Productive People's Party serves as a front for the remnants of the National Revolutionary's Fourth Army and the region's social-democratic politicians of the Party. Wang Jingwei's faction of the Central Committee, however, is quite weak, most of the members in Liangguang favouring Song Qingling's Populists.§!"
GXC_social_democrat_party: "Public Interest Party"
GXC_social_democrat_party_long: "Public Interest Party                                                §gThe Zhongguo Zhigongdang, or China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party of China) is the main political party of the Federalist movement in China. Founded in 1925, the party united disilusioned Kuomintang politicians and Overseas Chinese (especially Freemasons of the Hongmen), calling for the reform of the Republic of China into a proper federal state and multiparty democracy. While these hopes were quickly dashed by the Qing Restoration, they remain a significant force, albeit banned in Qing/Zhili-controlled lands for their explicit republicanism. Their platform, outside of federalism and republican democracy, expouses progressive social and political views from land and education reform to elected assemblies for all government levels.§!"
GXC_social_liberal_party: "Grand Republican League"
GXC_social_liberal_party_long: "Grand Republican League                                      §gThe Gonghe Datongmeng (Grand Republican League) was founded in 1928 as an alliance of Chen Jiongming, representing the federalist Zhigongdang, and Duan Qirui, representing the by-then defunct Republic of China and Anhui Clique, to create a coalition of republicans. While the League attracted fairly little attention, it became Chen's formal coalition in the Guangdong Provincial Assembly. The league is wide and unwieldy, containing federalists of all colours, Kuomintang remnants, business and gentry interests, and even syndicalists. With the collapse of the League, the coalition is on the verge of collapse as they barely share a common platform in maintaing stability in Guangdong, let alone republicanism.§!"

GXC_market_liberal_party_long: "Merchants' Public Safety Organization                     §gThe Guangzhou Yueshang Gongan Weichihui, or Merchant Corps for short, is the armed militia under the control of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce. Founded in 1912, the businessmen of the city organized and funded their own self-defence capabilities as the province descended into warlordism and banditry. The Merchant Corps rose up against the Kuomintang in 1924, convinced that they were spreading syndicalism, but were utterly crushed. Chen Lianbo, its leader from the beginning, fled to Hong Kong, only returning after the failed Northern Expedition. As part of Chen Jiongming's coalition, the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce and its paramilitary represent business interests in the province, their anti-union stance forcing the coalition to water-down progressive legislation, creating great tension.§!"

It is not a political party per se, being represented either by the Merchant Corps or as independents in the Provincial Assembly.

### Focus ###
GXC_Liangguang_Dyarchy: "Liangguang Dyarchy"
GXC_Liangguang_Dyarchy_desc: "Liangguang is not a single state or even government. It is the union of two provinces, Guangxi in the west and Guangdong in the east, and their governemnts remain separate and largely independent of each other. This union, so far, remains an informal one, and steps should be made to formalise it under the recreated position of Governor-General of Liangguang."

### Guangxi Development

GXC_Guangxi_Construction_Plan: "Guangxi Construction Plan"
GXC_Guangxi_Construction_Plan_desc: "Out of the two provinces consisting Liangguang, Guangxi is the one clearly lagging behind in economic development. With additional funding from wealthier Guangdong, a plan has been devised to spurr the local economy and reduce the burden Guangxi has on its neighbouring province's wealth."

GXC_Get_Some_Money: "Get Some Money"
GXC_Get_Some_Money_desc: "It may seem obvious, but the leaders of Guangxi are soldiers, not economists. The large army the Clique maintains needs to be funded, and there is a limit on how much Guangdong is willing to spare to prop them up. Funds must be acquired if Guangxi's ambitions are to be fulfilled."

GXC_Warlordist_Economy: "Warlordist Economy"
GXC_Warlordist_Economy_desc: "Many provincial military governments in China have lackluster economies due to the very nature of their regimes, with every bit of wealth funnelled into the army. Guangxi is no exception, but why should this change? Guangxi needs this army to protect itself and its interests. The economy will continue to serve the army."

GXC_Opium_Smuggling: "Opium Smuggling"
GXC_Opium_Smuggling_desc: "It is no secret that Guangxi, like many provinces, have a serious opium problem. On the other hand, a major opium trade route courses through the province and the Clique profits from it greatly. Since we need these profits to expand and maintain our army, we must expand these smuggling operations, even if embracing this sin will be frowned upon by many."

GXC_Economic_Modernization: "Economic Modernisation"
GXC_Economic_Modernization_desc: "Guangxi cannot continue to depend on the awful opium trade any longer. It is not only an addiction for many Chinese, but also for the provincial administration in order to fund its operations. While modernising the economy will be an expensive venture, it is a necessary one in the long-term or else the people will remain destitute and full of vice."

GXC_Financial_Reorganization: "Financial Reorganisation"
GXC_Financial_Reorganization_desc: "As part of modernising the economy of Guangxi, the provincial finances must be completely overhauled. Experts from Guangdong will have to be brought it to bring the economy back to scratch, from suppressing opium smuggling to diversifying its economic activities."

GXC_Develop_Terrace_Field: "Develop Terrace Fields"
GXC_Develop_Terrace_Field_desc: "Terrace fields are certainly nothing new in Southern China. Guangxi especially, where its rough terrain makes it an outright necessity in many parts of the province. Still, they are not easy technical feats and require significant investment before farmers can work them. After all, Guangxi is still very agrarian and there is little reason to believe that this will change in the near future."

GXC_Guangxi_Ruled_by_Guangxi_People: "Guangxi Ruled by Guangxi People"
GXC_Guangxi_Ruled_by_Guangxi_People_desc: "The province of Guangxi should be governed by the people of Guangxi. This is undisputable and even Guangdong recognises and even encourages the need for autonomy and self-rule."

GXC_Suppress_Bandits: "Suppress Banditry"
GXC_Suppress_Bandits_desc: "Banditry has been plaguing Guangxi since the Xinhai Revolution. Even before then, the province has a notorious history with bandits and it remains deeply-associated with them. This must change in order to modernise the province and develop it economically."

GXC_Enlighten_Minorities: "Enlighten the Minorities"
GXC_Enlighten_Minorities_desc: "Guangxi is home to many ethnic minorities. While they are all Chinese in the national sense, of course, the province will never be able to develop democratic traditions and self-rule if the minorities remain uneducated and poor. They must be involved if Guangxi is to become prosperous."

GXC_We_Are_Bandits: "We Are Bandits!"
GXC_We_Are_Bandits_desc: "Guangxi and banditry have a long and deep history together. Why should this tradition be broken? These Guangxi bandits remain known as some of the greatest warriors in China. We should embrace this identity, not destroy it, for it is what we truly are."

GXC_Embrace_Regionalism: "Embrace Regionalism"
GXC_Embrace_Regionalism_desc: "Guangxi is special and neither Beijing or even Guangzhou can tell us otherwise. We should focus on our province first and foremost and maintain our regional identity against centralist and assimilationist efforts."

GXC_Warrior_Identity: "Warrior Identity"
GXC_Warrior_Identity_desc: "Guangxi people are feared throughout China as unequaled soldiers. This has been true for millennia, and never rung truer than when Guangxi soldiers led the vanguard during the revolution and the brief Republic."

GXC_We_Need_Soldiers: "We Need Soldiers"
GXC_We_Need_Soldiers_desc: "Guangxi need soldiers. Always did, always will. Our people strive in warfare, and the Clique needs to stay influential in the region. We must improve our abilities to recruit people into the Provincial Army and train them to become the ferocious soldiers Guangxi is known for."

GXC_Militia_Corps: "Militia Corps"
GXC_Militia_Corps_desc: "The Militia Corps are, as the name obviously suggests, a militia recruited from the rural towns and villages of Southern China, often organised by local leaders and landowners. We should incorporate and formalise this system in order to secure our manpower sources."

GXC_Wolf_Troops: "Wolf Troops"
GXC_Wolf_Troops_desc: "Wolf Troops were special auxiliary troops from Guangxi during the Ming Dynasty. These troops quickly became notorious for their ferocity, violence and, more importantly, successes on the battlefield. They were often used to suppressed local rebellions and foreign excursions. Since then, the term has remained part of the Guangxi spirit to denote the province's elite soldiers."

GXC_Mountain_Battle_Training: "Mountain Warfare Training"
GXC_Mountain_Battle_Training_desc: "The terrain of Guangxi is rough and mountains are prevalent. As such, many people in the province are well-suited for mountain warfare, and formalising a training regimen and mountain infantry units will give us a technical edge in this specialised type of war."

GXC_Militarized_Society: "Militarised Society"
GXC_Militarized_Society_desc: "Guangxi has been known for militarism for a very long time and this was only further entrenched since the Xinhai Revolution. The province is becoming thoroughly militarised, which is a good thing considering our ambitions in the region."

GXC_Sparta_of_the_East: "Sparta of the East"
GXC_Sparta_of_the_East_desc: "Sparta is well-known to many Westerners: A highly-militarised society that prized martial prowess over everything else, where war dominated every aspect of Spartan life. While this remains relatively unknown to many Chinese, the monicker of \"Sparta of the East\" has stuck with foreigners and western-educated locals and it remains a rather apt one."

###Military

GXC_provincial_armies: "Restructuring the Provincial Armies"
GXC_provincial_armies_desc: "Guangdong and Guangxi have had separate armies, command and administrative structures since the formation of the League of Eight Provinces. The two forces must be united under a single command in order to become a cohesive fighting force, lest we find ourselves caught in a fight with a split and disorganized one."

GXC_hong_kong_contacts: "Hong Kong Contacts"
GXC_hong_kong_contacts_desc: "With our proximity to Hong Kong and the tight commercial links between it and our provinces, we have numerous contacts within the Legation Cities, many of them sympathetic to our cause and the rest willing to profit from it. This opens us to a market of surplus weaponry and advanced machinery from the rest of China and the West."

GXC_tooling_help: "Extra Tooling Help"
GXC_tooling_help_desc: "Our contacts in Hong Kong have secured us a shipment of modern machine parts that we can use to upgrade our current stock. This will cost us, but would help us quickly rebuild our forces compared to our rivals."

GXC_second_arsenal: "Expand the Second Arsenal"
GXC_second_arsenal_desc: "The Paijang Artillery Factory, also known as the Second Guangdong Arsenal, was built in 1933 with help from Siemmsen & Co. and the AOG. It recently began producing field artillery and ammunition for the League until it collapsed. With government help, it can be expanded and ensure it remains out of German hands."

GXC_improved_communications: "Acquire Radios"
GXC_improved_communications_desc: "Logistics and communications are instrumental in modern warfare. From our Hong Kong contacts, we can gain access to some modern radios, which could prove instrumental to our forces' ability to fight as they would improve officers' ability to maintain contact with their subordinates during heavy fighting."

GXC_specialized_artillery: "Specialized AA/AT Guns"
GXC_specialized_artillery_desc: "While air and armoured power remains fairly limited in China, their presence is steadily growing and we must adopt countermeasures to deal with them effectively. Artillery pieces designed to counter aircraft and armoured vehicles are continuing to be the most cost-effective solution."

GXC_Liangguang_Aviation_Bureau: "Liangguang Aviation Bureau"
GXC_Liangguang_Aviation_Bureau_desc: "Both provinces have a tiny aviation industry spurred by the demands of the provincial armies and their leaders. While this industry may be insignificant to foreign eyes, it is an incredible boon compared to most Chinese provincial governments. The two provinces should pool their resources and expertise together to maintain the significant advantage military aviation brings to the modern battlefield."

GXC_Aircraft_Repair_Factory: "Aircraft Repair Factory"
GXC_Aircraft_Repair_Factory_desc: "Shaoguan has a small factory able to build small military aircraft. While their capabilities are small, they are able to repair and maintain the aircraft we have in stock."

GXC_Liangguang_Aviation_School: "Liangguang Aviation School"
GXC_Liangguang_Aviation_School_desc: "In order to create any kind of air force, officers and men must be trained and educated. An aviation school to train pilots and crews would help us create the basic infrastructure and develop our fledging air fleet."

GXC_rejuvenation_type_aircraft: "Rejuvenation-type Fighters"
GXC_rejuvenation_type_aircraft_desc: "The aircraft factories in Liuzhou and Shaoguan have begun developing their own aircraft design. The Guangxi Type 3, a biplane of mixed construction, is one of the first successful fighters made in China, while Shaoguan is working on a modern monoplane they named \"Rejuvenation-type\". They could become the backbone of our air force and give us an immeasurable advantage over our foes."

GXC_northern_doctrine: "Northern Doctrine: Firepower"
GXC_northern_doctrine_desc: "The Chinese armies in the north have developed their own doctrine based on firepower from their experiences fighting in the North China Plain. Considering we are likely to be fighting the Northerners on their own turf, it would be wise to adopt their ideas and experiences for our own forces as we continue to rebuilt and reform our armies."

GXC_southern_doctrine: "Southern Doctrine: Mobility"
GXC_southern_doctrine_desc: "The fighting in Southern China since the Xinhai Revolution has mainly revolved around highly mobile infantry forces focusing on mobility and maintaining a manpower advantage. Since we are certainly going to be defending ourselves from attackers, we should continue to adapt from our own lessons fighting in the South, where our troops already fight best."

GXC_reopen_whampoa: "Professional Officer Corps"
GXC_reopen_whampoa_desc: "Professionalism among the officers of Chinese armies is hard to come by since many of them are former bandits. However, Liangguang has seen a steadily increasing literacy rate, which gives us an advantage when recruiting and training new officers. We must strive for professionalization so that our officers can be the true defenders of the Republic and not an army trained from the \"Green School\"."

GXC_militia_integration: "Militia Integration"
GXC_militia_integration_desc: "Armies in Southern China since the creation of the Qing New Armies in the late 19th century have essentially been large militia forces. Integrating them into our army structure will ensure that we have access to motivated and experienced manpower, eager to defend their homes from warlords and bandits."

GXC_minjun_reforms: "Minjun Reforms"
GXC_minjun_reforms_desc: "Minjun, or citizen/popular armies, are the name used to denote volunteer soldiers in Southern Armies. They have a mixed reputation to say the least, as the Kuomintang derided them as bandits in their propaganda. We must reform this force, as citizen-soldiers will be the backbone of an effective army that will defend the republic just as they did in the United States and Britain."

GXC_civilwar_lessons: "Lessons of the Yue-Gui Wars"
GXC_civilwar_lessons_desc: "The Yue-Gui Wars, shorthand for the Guangdong-Guangxi Wars, refer to a number of conflicts between Guangdong and Guangxi province since the Xinhai Revolution. Our forces still have much to learn when it comes to modern warfare, and the most recent war will be examined and studied in order to improve our armies, for the wars in China appear to have no end in sight."

GXC_modern_army_structure: "Modernize Army Structure"
GXC_modern_army_structure_desc: "Chinese armies differ significantly from modern Western armies despite decades of attempting to emulate them. Unsurprisingly, a modern army structure is a necessity to properly conduct wars, and the Chief of Staff has presented a new system to organize infantry divisions."

GXC_improved_logistics: "Improved Logistics"
GXC_improved_logistics_desc: "Amateurs study tactics, masters study logistics. In China, where the infrastructure ranges from poor to non-existent, properly organizing the logistics of armies can not only mean the difference between victory and defeat, but save them from complete annihilation."

GXC_mountain_warfare: "Lessons on Mountain Warfare"
GXC_mountain_warfare_desc: "Southern China has no shortages of rough terrain with the Nanling Mountains covering the northern region of Liangguang. Many of our troops are well-acquainted with mountain warfare; their and recruits from the region will help us study this difficult and intricate type of war."

GXC_modern_engineers: "Permanent Engineer Corps"
GXC_modern_engineers_desc: "The Pearl River is proving to be a great obstacle to large unit movements within Liangguang. A professional corps of engineers inspired by their western equivalents will help us surmount challenges presented by river crossings during battle, as there will be no shortage of those in the future."

GXC_proper_recon: "Reconnaissance Training"
GXC_proper_recon_desc: "Recon and intelligence has always been a staple of a competent army. Modern war has given us new tools and challenges to accomplish this necessary task, which will ensure that our troops know what is in front of them and give our officers the ability to plan and react properly to challenges."

GXC_modern_forts: "Fortifications Study"
GXC_modern_forts_desc: "It seems inevitable that war will be coming to us at some point as we are surrounded by hostile rivals. Fortifications in modern war have a mixed reputation, but the proper and reasonable use of static fortifications can help deter enemies from certain areas, funnel them into certain chokepoints, or create difficult obstacles on strategic points."

GXC_federal_army: "Recreate the Guofangjun"
GXC_federal_army_desc: "The Guofangjun, or National Defense Army, was first formed by Chen Jiongming in 1920. It was essentially an extension of the Guangdong Provincial Army, which he intended to be under civilian control of a Chinese federalist government. It is time to finalize the reorganization of the provincial armies into the re-formed Guofangjun, which will defend and liberate a free Chinese republic."

GXC_defense_force: "Liangguang Defense Force"
GXC_defense_force_desc: "With great strides done to reform the provincial armies, we can start finalizing its restructuring into a proper defense force. This will make our army's purpose clear: The Defense of Liangguang from invaders, bandits, and rebels."

GXC_seventh_army: "The Steel Army's Glory"
GXC_seventh_army_desc: "The Army of Steel is the nickname of the Kuomintang Republic of China's 7th Army, whose men hailed from Guangxi. The Steel Army was one of the few successful units of the Northern Expedition, when they earned their monicker, and their legacy lives on in the province as part of Guangxi's long list of military successes."

GXC_fourth_army: "The Iron Army's Legacy"
GXC_fourth_army_desc: "The Iron Army is the nickname of the 4th Army of the Republic of China. These men from Guangdong formed the core of the KMT's forces during the Northern Expedition, quickly becoming known as one of its most capable units. As this army was essentially created from Chen Jiongming's Guangdong Army, their legacy is maintained to this day as a highly mobile and competent army despite the Expedition's failure."

GXC_Officer_Vanguards: "Officer Vanguards"
GXC_Officer_Vanguards_desc: "Officer Vanguards are units consisting purely of veteran NCOs and officers to serve as a vanguard to the army. Instead of spreading our officers thin to lead poorly-trained and inexperienced units, we can instead concentrate them in their own units, where their experience and skill will make them useful in daring assaults."

GXC_Professional_Officer_Corps: "Professional Officer Corps"
GXC_Professional_Officer_Corps_desc: "Professionalising the officer corps will ensure that our divisions are led by trained and talented officers. As we are likely to field a large army with limited time and resources to train and equip them, poor leadership would lead to complete disasters, but good leadership can make up for these shortcomings."

GXC_french_advisors: "French Advisors' Return"
GXC_french_advisors_desc: "Military advisors from France were present before and during the Northern Expedition. Now that we are (at least, on paper) aligned with the Kuomintang's Central Committee, we can expect French advisors to join us once more and ensure that our military forces are properly prepared and trained. Should we go against the Central Committee or the Syndicalists, however, we can expect them to leave immediately."

GXC_liangguang_NRA: "Liangguang's NRA"
GXC_liangguang_NRA_desc: "The National Revolutionary Army has now been properly set up in Liangguang, making us another step closer to achieving Sun Yat-sen's dream of a modern Republic of China devoid of warlords, imperialists, and traitors."

#Guangdong Development

GXC_Guangdong_Star: "Guangdong Star"
GXC_Guangdong_Star_desc: "Under Chen Jiongming, Guangdong has become one of, if not the, most economically stable and prosperous provinces in the nation. Limiting military spending (significantly more than any other provincial government) and the relative stability of the last decade has allowed the province to succeed where other provinces failed. Still, Guangdong has so much more potential, and we should work to improve it further."

GXC_Financial_Reform: "Financial Reform"
GXC_Financial_Reform_desc: "While less endemic than many provinces in China, Guangdong still suffers from corruption and Black Monday has shaken things up. Finances must be adjusted and reformed if Liangguang is to recover and grow once more."

GXC_New_Industrial_Zones: "New Industrial Zones"
GXC_New_Industrial_Zones_desc: "The AOG presence in Guangzhou seriously hampered the Provincial Government's finances and economic development. Regardless, the last decade has seen many successes in industrial development as smaller cities and towns developed industries instead. This trend should be further supported in order to keep spurring economic growth in the area."

GXC_Infrastructral_Efforts: "Infrastructural Efforts"
GXC_Infrastructral_Efforts_desc: "Infrastructure in China is notoriously underdeveloped. Railways are still rare; the main rail line from Guangzhou to Beijing still remains incomplete for example. While expensive and time-consuming, improving infrastructure is the base to any kind of heavy economic development."

GXC_Fuguo_Coal_Mine: "Expand the Fuguo Coal Mine"
GXC_Fuguo_Coal_Mine_desc: "We are still fighting shortages of important resources such as coal and the mines in Fuguo remain small. They should be expanded, for coal is one of the most important resources in the world and we must limit our imports of it."

GXC_Municipal_Development: "Municipal Development"
GXC_Municipal_Development_desc: "The Federalists have always focused on the counties, towns and villages. Developing them is a large part of their platform as a way to improve the lives of the people and the provincial economy in general."

GXC_Guangdong_Industrial_Exhibition: "Guangdong Industrial Exhibition"
GXC_Guangdong_Industrial_Exhibition_desc: "Like many provincial governors, we hope to turn our province into Model ones in order to strenghten our influence, further political goals and, of course, generally improve it. Showing off our industrial development and expertise will help with this goal, especially as China in general continues to lag behind industrially."

GXC_Revive_Guangdong_Arsenal: "Renovate the Guangdong Arsenal"
GXC_Revive_Guangdong_Arsenal_desc: "The Guangdong Arsenal is one of the major Chinese arsenals. Now that it is back in our hands, we should expand it in order to enlarge our industrial workforce and, of course, our military production capabilities to give us an extra edge versus our enemies."

GXC_Local_Investment: "Local Investment"
GXC_Local_Investment_desc: "Investing in local economies throughout the province will spurr economic development, which we sorely need in order to maintain our prominence in national politics. This involves a lot of construction work since the country in general since the existing infrastructure remain lackluster."

GXC_Consolidate_Local_Support: "Consolidate Local Support"
GXC_Consolidate_Local_Support_desc: "Chen Jiongming was able to maintain his governorship for so long by appealing to the local elites despite his relatively radical political agenda. While this remains unpopular among his radical supporters, Chen's governorship depends on their support as they have significant influence in the elected Provincial Assembly."

GXC_Republican_United_Front: "Republican United Front"
GXC_Republican_United_Front_desc: "Chen Jiongming is an ardent republican and has worked with many colourful types in his tenure from anarchists and the KMT to liberals and conservatives. Wishing to remain at the forefront of the Chinese republican movement, he hopes to create a united front to work towards his goal of a democratic, federal Chinese republic."

GXC_Education_Reform_focus: "Education Reform"
GXC_Education_Reform_focus_desc: "Education remains poor compared to global standards and its improvement is one of the main concerns of the Public Interest Party. Significant funds have been diverted to improve institutions and this must be maintained in order to educate the people and bring prosperity to China in an age of warfare and chaos."

GXC_Expand_Yue_University: "Expand the University of Guangdong"
GXC_Expand_Yue_University_desc: "The University of Guangdong was founded in 1921 during Chen Jiongming's first tenure as Governor of Guangdong and it was the cornerstone of his Provincial Education Committee. Despite growing instability in the region, education remains a priority and expanding the institution will have important long-term benefits."

GXC_Professional_Training_School: "Professional Training School"
GXC_Professional_Training_School_desc: "Professionalism among civil servants has been a staple of Chinese culture and statecraft dating millennia. We should continue to reform our education system along these traditional lines, but improve and modernise them to improve our cadre of educated elites."

GXC_Massive_Literacy_Campaign: "Massive Literacy Campaign"
GXC_Massive_Literacy_Campaign_desc: "Illiteracy has plagued us for too long. If China is to prosper again, then every Chinese must be educated so that it can participate in its improvement. After all, how can the Chinese people be free if they cannot read and make decisions for themselves?"

GXC_Reform_Local_Culture: "Reform Local Culture"
GXC_Reform_Local_Culture_desc: "Guangdong was never spared from decadence, corruption and mismanagement. These problems cannot be solved unless the roots are target, which is, more often than not, deeply ingrained in culture. While Chen Jiongming has been fighting the vices of gambling and opium smoking for over two decades, these efforts must continue in order to improve people's livelihoods."

GXC_County_Self_Governmence: "County Self-Governance"
GXC_County_Self_Governmence_desc: "Chen Jiongming, along with many prominent Chinese reformers, understand that China is too large to be governed like a unitary state, and rearranging the government along federalist lines would help alleviate many of its ills related to the Central Government. This must be done Bottom-Up, not Top-Down, and must begin in the traditionally-autonomous counties, where democracy can strive."

GXC_Land_to_the_Tiller: "Land to the Tiller"
GXC_Land_to_the_Tiller_desc: "Land reform has been central to the Public Interest Party's platform, but has encountered serious opposition from the very beginning. Still, the \"Land to the Tiller\" program must be resumed in order to help the peasantry organise itself and participate in democracy instead of remaining poor, vulnerable to the whims of landowners."

GXC_Promote_Self_Organization: "Promote Self-Organisation"
GXC_Promote_Self_Organization_desc: "Self-Organisation is one of the core tenets of Chen Jiongming's ideology. Democracy is not possible if the people isn't free, and the people cannot be free if they aren't politically self-ruling and economically independent. The key to democracy in China will be to organise the people to be able to fight corruption and authoritarianism."

GXC_Enlightened_Gentry_Dominance: "Enlightened Gentry Dominance"
GXC_Enlightened_Gentry_Dominance_desc: "Landowners dominate the rural counties of Liangguang and have serious influence in the Provincial Assembly. Their support has been essential thus far, and it would be unwise to betray them as they have been cooperative from the start and even willing to accept moderate reforms. This will not be a popular move among reformers, however."

GXC_Agricultural_Commodification: "Agricultural Commodification"
GXC_Agricultural_Commodification_desc: "Agriculture remains the most important way of life for the vast majority of Chinese. Ensuring that this industry remains profitable will improve our revenues and help rural communities proper."

GXC_Rural_Development: "Rural Development"
GXC_Rural_Development_desc: "Land and political reforms are nice and all, but the rural people, the overwhelming majority of our population, will not believe our words unless they can see improvements in their lives. Developing rural communities will be key to improving economic prosperity of the whole province."

GXC_Federalist_Model_Province: "Federalist Model Province"
GXC_Federalist_Model_Province_desc: "Chen Jiongming hopes that a \"Federalist Model Province\" will further prove that his ideals are more than just speeches and pamphlets, but that they will truly lead to a better, free and truly unified China, and convince the other provincial governors to follow his example."

###Split and Reorganisation

GXC_Fire_in_the_Lake: "Fire in the Lake"
GXC_Fire_in_the_Lake_desc: "The Dyarchy has fallen! The many forces competing for power could not be kept under control and war has erupted between the two provinces. The faction that will emerge victorious in the Guangdong-Guangxi War will be able to not only dictate the future of Liangguang, but will affect Chinese national politics as a whole."

###Guangxi Dominance

GXC_Guangxi_Warlord_Domination: "Guangxi Clique Dominance"
GXC_Guangxi_Warlord_Domination_desc: "Ma Ji's Guangxi Clique has emerged victorious in the Yue-Gui War. Continued militarisation is on the menu, that is certain. What is not certain is whether or not Guangxi will vie for national prominence or remain focused in regional politics."

GXC_Stabilize_the_Situation: "Stabilise the Situation"
GXC_Stabilize_the_Situation_desc: "It is clear that Guangdong does not welcome their conquerors. If we are to integrate them into our government, we will need to work with the locals and compromise with them. Stability is key, and winning the local elites over will help us in the long-run."

GXC_Exploit_Our_New_Lands: "Exploit our New Lands"
GXC_Exploit_Our_New_Lands_desc: "Guangdong is wealthy, but this wealth now belongs to Guangxi! What the locals think is of no importance; the continued growth of the Guangxi Army is paramount!"

GXC_Further_Militarization: "Further Militarisation"
GXC_Further_Militarization_desc: "Under Chen Jiongming, Guangdong was significantly demilitarised, focusing on civilian undertakings instead. This trend must be reverted in order to further expand our forces."

GXC_Raid_Our_Enemy: "Border Raids"
GXC_Raid_Our_Enemy_desc: "Guangxi has a history of bandits and raiders. This... tradition, so-to-speak, remains quite prevalent, and we can profit from it. In order to further sustain our large military, we can raid our neighbours to supplement our equipment."

GXC_Expand_Nanning_Academy: "Expand the Nanning Academy"
GXC_Expand_Nanning_Academy_desc: "The Nanning Military Academy dates from pre-Revolutionary times, training a large number of NCOs from Southern China, and the majority of Guangxi officers are graduates. With our expanding army, we must expand this institution to ensure quality officers are trained."

GXC_Expansionism: "Expansionism"
GXC_Expansionism_desc: "Guangxi can only secure her future through conquest. Otherwise, we will be doomed to remain subservient to another government."

GXC_End_Yunnan_Threat: "End the Yunnan Threat"
GXC_End_Yunnan_Threat_desc: "Yunnan and Guangxi have been fighting for regional dominance since the Xinhai Revolution. We are well-aware that Yunnan was complicit with Li Zongren's invasion attempt, and they will now pay for their treachery."

GXC_Republican_Glory: "Republican Glory"
GXC_Republican_Glory_desc: "Guangxi was one of the first provinces to join both the Xinhai Revolution and the Constitutional Protection movement. Our future is intertwined with the Republic, and our recent history bathed in its short-lived glory. The Republic must be reborn, and Guangxi soldiers will be the republican vanguard!"

GXC_Lu_Rontings_Legacy: "Lu Rongting's Legacy"
GXC_Lu_Rontings_Legacy_desc: "Lu Rongting was a brilliant man. Not only in military matters, but in personal relations and his eye for talent unmatched. Under him, the Guangxi Clique developed an open-minded and pluralist group that brought people in for their skill regardless of their background, as demonstrated by Lu's adopted sons and successors, a Hui Muslim and a Vietnamese."

###Chen Lianbo path

GXC_Merchant_Government: "A Merchant Government"
GXC_Merchant_Government_desc: "Chen Lianbo has emerged victorious! The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce and the Merchant Corps have been able to overthrow the treacherous Guangxi Clique. Under the Cantonese merchants, Liangguang is on the path to economic prosperity above all, where wealth will flow, a glimmering star in a dark, chaotic void."

GXC_Merchant_Corp_Dominance: "Merchant Corps Dominance"
GXC_Merchant_Corp_Dominance_desc: "The Guangzhou Merchant Corps, the Chamber of Commerce's own defence force, has become one of the dominant forces in Chen Lianbo's Liangguang. Expectedly, they have become a favoured institution and their influence has grown significantly."

GXC_Strengthen_Trade_Protection: "Strengthen Trade Protection"
GXC_Strengthen_Trade_Protection_desc: "The Chamber of Commerce insists on reviewing many legislation enacted by Chen Jiongming's government. They are pushing for greater trade protection for Chinese merchants in Liangguang in order to ensure that wealth is created and remains in the hands of Chinese."

GXC_End_Labor_Movement: "Suppress the Labour Movement"
GXC_End_Labor_Movement_desc: "The labour movement in Guangdong has grown along with industrialisation, protected by Chen Jiongming's socialist policies. This cannot go on, as the labour movement continue to threaten the economic stability and prosperity of the province. After all, can these puppets of the Western Syndicalist powers be trusted in the first place?"

GXC_Philantropy: "Philantropy"
GXC_Philantropy_desc: "Chen Lianbo is a philanthropist, which has made him beloved with the people. The new governor certainly does not intend to cut back on this generosity; he will continue to personally fund schools and hospitals, along with other large projects for the good of the people. Besides, it's very good PR."

GXC_Merchants_Fight_Bandits: "Crush Guangxi Bandits"
GXC_Merchants_Fight_Bandits_desc: "Banditry in Guangxi has been a thorn for the region's development. Their very presence is enough to hamper economic growth, something the Chamber of Commerce can no longer tolerate, and the Merchant Corps will ensure that trade is protected in the region."

GXC_Chinese_Washington: "The Chinese Washington"
GXC_Chinese_Washington_desc: "During the Merchant Corps Uprising, a Western commentator in Hong Kong described Chen Lianbo as the \"Chinese Washington\". He is certainly not the first one to have received that monicker, but it is certainly a positive one in the eyes of the West and helps our cause outside of China."

###Shared Guangxi-Merchant Corps

GXC_Reapproachment_with_Yunnan: "Rapprochement with Yunnan"
GXC_Reapproachment_with_Yunnan_desc: "Our conflict with Yunnan cannot go on. For the good of the Republic, we must make ammends and bound together, or else we will be destroyed one by one by the vengeful Northerners."

GXC_Reapproachment_with_Yunnan2: "Rapprochement with Yunnan"
GXC_Reapproachment_with_Yunnan2_desc: "Our conflict with Yunnan cannot go on. For the good of the Republic, we must make ammends and bound together, or else we will be destroyed one by one by the vengeful Northerners."

GXC_Secure_South_China: "Secure South China"
GXC_Secure_South_China_desc: "Securing the south of the country will ensure that Liangguang will remain the dominant force in the region. This way, we will be able to secure our autonomy from the Central Government, or they will have to force us to bow."

GXC_Conquer_Indochina: "Conquer Indochina"
GXC_Conquer_Indochina_desc: "The radicals in Indochina are a threat to our government should they decide to spread their toxic ideology north. Their evil government must be toppled, replaced by one friendly to our interests to secure our southern border."

GXC_Secure_South_China2: "Secure South China"
GXC_Secure_South_China2_desc: "Securing the south of the country will ensure that Liangguang will remain the dominant force in the region. This way, we will be able to secure our autonomy from the Central Government, or they will have to force us to bow."

GXC_Conquer_Indochina2_desc: "The radicals in Indochina are a threat to our government should they decide to spread their toxic ideology north. Their evil government must be toppled, replaced by one friendly to our interests to secure our southern border."

###Chen Jiongming and the Federalists

GXC_Initiate_United_Provinces: "Third Shantou Conference"
GXC_Initiate_United_Provinces_desc: "The First and Second Shantou Conferences were meetings of the Federalist movement's leaders, joined by delegates of other national leaders, to decide the future of the movement. It is time to reunite the movement once more and finally work towards our dream of a federal, democratic China and officially break with the Beijing Government."

GXC_United_Provincial_Consititution: "Provisional Federal Constitution"
GXC_United_Provincial_Consititution_desc: "The writing of a constitution is an important part of Chen Jiongming's Reconstruction Plan. While this one will be provisional until China can be reunited, we will bring together the leaders of all provinces and counties and write our federal constitution."

GXC_Southern_Reconstruction_Plan: "Southern Reconstruction Plan"
GXC_Southern_Reconstruction_Plan_desc: "During the 1920s, Chen Jiongming wrote an ambitious Reconstruction Plan for China, hoping to bridge the gap between the warring factions and reunite the country, and this was adopted by several other provincial governors at the time. The plan can be adapted for our allied provinces and help build up the south as a model of the benefits of federalism and democracy."

GXC_Civilian_Guangxi: "Restore Civilian Control in Guangxi"
GXC_Civilian_Guangxi_desc: "For too long, Guangxi has been controlled by power-hungry, irresponsible militarists that have sapped to province of all its wealth and happiness. Restoring power to the Provincial Assembly and implementing the Reconstruction Plan in Guangxi will give it and the Federalism movement much-needed practical experience and results to popularize the United Provinces."

GXC_Feds_Supress_Bandits: "End Banditry in Guangxi"
GXC_Feds_Supress_Bandits_desc: "Banditry has been plaguing Guangxi since the Xinhai Revolution. Even before then, the province has a notorious history with bandits and it remains deeply-associated with them. Suppressing it is our top priority in the province should we win the hearts and minds of the people and make our promises of proper economic development true."

GXC_Military_Nationalization: "Military Nationalisation"
GXC_Military_Nationalization_desc: "One of the biggest problems currently plaguing China are the warlords. They stand in the way of national unification, ensuring continued endemic corruption and authoritarianism. Chen believes there can only be one army for China, one that is clearly under the civilian Federal government. This will likely be the final straw to the warlords aligned with us."

###NPA announces Northern Expedition 2

GXC_National_Protection_Alliance: "National Protection Alliance"
GXC_National_Protection_Alliance_desc: "In order to overthrow the corrupt and unconstitutional government in Beijing, the National Protection movement must be revived once more. Bringing together the leaders of the South will give us the power to finally reunify China once and for all."

GXC_Northern_Expedition: "Northern Expedition"
GXC_Northern_Expedition_desc: "Invading the North is a very difficult feat, as demonstrated by the Kuomintang's attempt that led to their demise. It will require thorough planning, secured logistics and, of course, an army united in purpose. We will succeed where the KMT has failed and reunite the nation!"

GXC_Negotiate_For_Reunification: "Negotiate for Reunification"
GXC_Negotiate_For_Reunification_desc: "Chen Jiongming believes that the only way to truly unite China is through compromise and negotiation with the north, creating a lasting union instead of a hollow victory through force. While the Qing and their allies cannot be reasoned with, there is a chance that the republicans in Fengtian will see reason, or that Wu Peifu will renounce the Qing through his patriotism."

GXC_A_New_China: "A New China"
GXC_A_New_China_desc: "With Beijing in our hands, we have finally secured our claim as the Central Government of China. Now, we can begin rebuilding a new Republic of China, one that will stand the test of time!"

GXC_Li_Zongren: "New Guangxi Takeover"
GXC_Li_Zongren_desc: "Li Zongren and his New Guangxi Clique have secured control over the two provinces. For the first time since 1925, the right-wing of the Kuomintang has a significant base of operations. The true National Revolution can now begin under the Generalissimo's leadership."

GXC_three-stage_revolution: "Three-Stage Revolution"
GXC_three-stage_revolution_desc: "Sun Yat-sen, our Party's founder, envisioned that the National Revolution would happen in three stages after the failure of the first Republic. We are still merely at the first stage, where the National Revolutionary Army must destroy the vestiges of Manchu tyranny and corruption. To this end, martial law must be enforced while the Party keeps tight control over institutions."

GXC_reform_7th_army: "Reform the 7th Army"
GXC_reform_7th_army_desc: "The 7th Army was the pride of the NRA. Under Li and with its recruits from Guangxi, it was the most successful army during the failed Northern Expedition, a beacon of hope despite the overall failure of the campaign. The Army must be reformed, its legacy enshrined as it once again carries the torch of National Revolution."

GXC_dang_guo: "Dang Guo"
GXC_dang_guo_desc: "\"Yi Dang Zhi Guo\", meaning \"using the party to run the state\", was the cornerstone of the first two stages of Sun Yat-sen's National Revolution where the Nationalist Party would rule as a dictatorship until the Revolution comes to a successful conclusion."

GXC_kmt_militarism: "Republican Militarism"
GXC_kmt_militarism_desc: "The National Revolutionary Army is one of the pillars of the Republic. Militarist sentiments must be cultivated and encouraged in order to create citizens loyal to the Republic of China and the Kuomintang."

GXC_minzu_focus: "Focus on Minzu"
GXC_minzu_focus_desc: "Minzu, or Nationalism, is one of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. National unity is paramount to our success, and shall be the Principle that we will focus on until we have reunited China. The other two will have to wait until China is liberated from monarchists and warlords."

GXC_Chen_Mingshu: "Chen Mingshu's People's Government"
GXC_Chen_Mingshu_desc: "Chen Mingshu and his Productive People's Party, an offshoot of the Kuomintang, have secured control of Liangguang and proclaimed the People's Government. While it does not oppose the Kuomintang's government in Fujian, it remains Wang Jingwei's more authoritarian leadership of the Party, wishing to focus on developing democracy in China."

GXC_People_Production_Party_Plan: "Productive People’s Party Plan"
GXC_People_Production_Party_Plan_desc: "The Productive People's Party's agenda does not differ significantly from the Kuomintang's, nor does it oppose Sun Yat-sen's vision. Chen Mingshu merely believes that the Party should focus on developing democratic institutions in China alongside pushing harder on land reform to create a truly free nation."

GXC_local_democracy: "Promote Local Democracy"
GXC_local_democracy_desc: "Ensuring that local democracy can flourish will ensure that, when the time comes, the people will have ample experience and understanding of democratic institutions once they are created on a national level. Only through experience and education can China become a democratic republic as Sun Yat-sen wanted."

GXC_kmt_land_reform: "Nationalist Land Reform"
GXC_kmt_land_reform_desc: "While the previous governor of Guangdong made significant headways towards a proper land reform program, it was not enough. Until the peasants of China own the land instead of leasing it from corrupt landlords, they will never be free."

GXC_route_army: "Form the Route Armies"
GXC_route_army_desc: "Route Armies are, in terms of size, similar to a Western field army. Reorganizing the NRA in Liangguang is paramount to the region's defence of the National Revolution and the Route Armies will form the basis of our large units as we move increasingly towards modernization."

GXC_minquan_focus: "Focus on Minquan"
GXC_minquan_focus_desc: "Minquan, or Democracy, is one of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Creating democratic institutions and preparing the Chinese people for them is the most important objective of the National Revolution and will, in the long-run, prove that the Party is the best choice for China."

GXC_consolidate: "Consolidating KMT Presence"
GXC_consolidate_desc: "The Kuomintang and the Productive People's Party has a relatively weak presense in Liangguang, formerly secured under Chen Jiongming's treacherous Federalists. With the help of the National Revolutionary Army and Party institutions, we will consolidate our presence before we can prepare for the continuation of Sun Yat-sen's National Revolution."

GXC_tridemism: "Sanmin Doctrine"
GXC_tridemism_desc: "The Three Principles of the People, or Sanmin Doctrine, is the basis of Sun Yat-sen's political philosophy and the Kuomintang. The Principles guide our government in its policies and decisions, and their importance must be understood by the people in the coming fight."

GXC_renovate_whampoa: "Rebuild Whampoa"
GXC_renovate_whampoa_desc: "The Kuomintang Military Academy was first founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1924 in Whampoa (Huangpu) near Guangzhou. Officers trained there created a cadre of politically-conscious officers that would lead the NRA in the Revolution. With the Academy back in our hands, it is time to reinstitute it and resume training capable officers for the renewed Revolution."

GXC_join_KMT: "Join the KMT Government"

### Events ###

lng.1.t: "The Situation in Liangguang"
lng.1.d: "With the League of Eight Provinces falling into open warfare to secure Nanjing, Chen Jiongming, the Governor of Guangdong, announced the immediate secession of the province from the League. Denouncing the League as corrupt and unable to protect the rights and welfare of the people, he was followed suit by Governor Lu Rongting of Guangxi in the west. Accordingly, the provincial assemblies of Guangdong and Guangxi held a joint meeting in Guangzhou, electing Chen Jiongming as Extraordinary Governor-General of Liangguang.\n\nWhile the \"Two Guangs\" are united in defence against bandits, the ambition of Warlords from the disintegrating League, this new union of provinces is already proving to be struggling. The leaders of Guangdong and Guangxi are only united by pragmatism, the two having widely different aims for the region, let alone China as a whole. Lu Rongting leads a highly militarized province, while Chen leads a varied republican coalition in one of the few functioning democracies in all of China.\n\nLiangguang may avoid the bloodshed of the collapse of the League, but it will not avoid the consequences of Beijing's failure to keep China vaguely united."
lng.1.a: "Governor Chen will see us through."
lng.1.b: "Tell me more about Liangguang."
lng.1.c: "What about all these factions?"

lng.101.t: "Briefly Introducing Liangguang"
lng.101.d: "Liangguang, or \"Two Guangs\", is a geographical term representing the provinces of Guangxi in the west and Guangdong in the east. The Viceroyalty of Liangguang was first created during the Ming Dynasty, but would be dissolved and reformed numerous times until its final dissolution in 1911. Its official name was the lengthy \"Governor-General, Commander and Quartermaster, Supervisor of Waterways, and Inspector-General of the Two Expanses (Guangs) and Surrounding Areas\".\n\nGuangdong province is one of the most wealthy and developed parts of China, with Guangzhou rivaling Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. However, its recent history is marred with warfare and destruction, with the province losing Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhouwan to Western imperialists in the 19th century, while the Xinhai Revolution eventually brought further ruin by numerous wars between warlords and the turbulent rule of the Kuomintang. Since the failure of the Northern Expedition in 1926, the province has been governed Chen Jiongming and has seen a remarkable recovery and growth, developing a young provincial democracy in the process.\n\nGuangxi, meanwhile, has been ruled by Lu Rongting, who is seen as the quintessential warlord. The province has been highly militarized and its soldiers are well-known across China to be some of the best. However, this high level of militarization has been costly, and the wealthier Guangdong has been essentially keeping the Guangxi Army afloat, creating an interdependent relationship between the two provinces as Guangxi troops often supplement the smaller Guangdong Army."
lng.101.a: "Governor Chen will see us through."
lng.101.b: "What about all these factions?"

lng.102.t: "Factionalism in Liangguang"
lng.102.d: "While Chen Jiongming currently leads a wide coalition of republicans, the Grand Republican League, it contains numerous factions outside of his own political party.\n\nThe Public Interest Party, or Zhigongdang, was founded in 1925 by Chen Jiongming and his ally, Tang Jiyao. Its ideology can be compared to western social-democracy, wanting to improve civil and workers' rights throughout China. Mainly, however, it is the most important Federalist party in the country, calling for the Central government to be reorganized as a federal republic and multiparty democracy.\n\nThe Productive People's Party, led by Chen Mingshu, is essentially a front-organization for the moderate-left Kuomintang in Guangdong. While also social-democratic like the Federalists, they differ as the PPP's ideology and philosophy is based on Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and his teachings. Their major obstacle in working closer with the Federalists is the bad history between the two parties' founders, who violently split before the Northern Expedition.\n\nWhile not a political party, the Merchants' Public Safety Organization, the paramilitary organization of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, is highly influential. Led by Chen Lianbo, their main goal is to protect businesses and trade from bandits and irresponsible politicians. They have noticeable ties with Hong Kong and German businessmen, making them a target of local anti-concessionists as the AOG struggles to recoup their massive losses from Black Monday and the League Collapse.\n\nIn Guangxi, the provincial assembly is little but a rubber-stamping one for the Army. As such, there is little open opposition to the Guangxi Clique from political groups. The Clique's main enemies currently hide in Yunnan as Li Zongren patiently waits for his chance to strike and retake the province for his own Clique aligned with the right-wing of the Kuomintang."
lng.102.a: "Governor Chen will see us through."
lng.102.b: "Tell me more about Liangguang."

lng.2.t: "Liangguang Proposes Reconciliation"
lng.2.d: "As [GXC.GetLeader] secures Liangguang, it has become apparent that he wishes to improve relations with us, likely to secure his northwestern flank and end the rivalry between our provinces. Accepting means that not only our southeastern border will be more secure, but it may help stabilise southern China as the countryc ontinues to recover from the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces."
lng.2.a: "Accept"
lng.2.b: "Refuse"

lng.3.t: "Yunnan Accepts"
lng.3.d: "Good news! [YUN.GetLeader] has accepted our proposal. We shouldn't expect any trouble from Yunnan in the near future."
lng.3.a: "Excellent!"

lng.4.t: "Yunnan Refuses"
lng.4.d: "Bad news. [YUN.GetLeader] has refused our proposal of rapprochement. It is clear that he has ulterior motives and we should expect no help from them in the near future."
lng.4.a: "Bastard!"

lng.5.t: "Non-Aggression Pact with Hunan"
lng.5.d: "With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, the united provinces of Liangguang and the province of Hunan have naturally drifted together in the face of potential retribution from Nanjing. Chen Jiongming and Zhao Hengti are both federalists, believing in provincial and national constitutionalism and the importance of rule of law in these chaotic time. As such, the two have been cooperating since the dawn of the League in the first place, working together to secure the region's autonomy from Nanjing and, consequently, Beijing.\n\nThe two governors have thus agreed to stay neutral in the conflict in the former League and focus inward instead."
lng.5.a: "Excellent."

lng.6.t: "Non-Aggression Pact with Liangguang"
lng.6.d: "With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, the united provinces of Liangguang and the province of Hunan have naturally drifted together in the face of potential retribution from Nanjing.

lng.6.a: "Excellent"

lng.7.t: "[GXC.GetNameDef] Seeks our Protection"
lng.7.d: "Ma Ji, the governor of Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, is an old acquaintance of Marshall Wu. During the Kuomintang's failed war of conquest, he had fled his native province to fight under the Marshall, distinguishing himself as a very able general capable of defeating rebels in the south. Now that he has secured Southern China, he wishes to bring Liangguang back into the fold, which would give us a strong ally in a notoriously rebellious region of the country. Of course, that means he would have significant autonomy from Beijing and we will have to ensure he is protected from rivals in the region."
lng.7.a: "Of course! Welcome back, friend!"
lng.7.b: "It would be unwise to overstretch ourselves."

lng.8.t: "[GXC.GetNameDef] Seeks our Protection"
lng.8.d: "Chen Lianbo, the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, is a rich and powerful politician in Southern China. Seeing the Kuomintang and other warlord states as a threat to China's stability and economic development, he has been highly receptive of the Panasian idea and seeks protection. Of course, we must remember that Chen has ties with the wealthy merchants of China; he will certainly expect some concessions for his loyalty, but his support could be a significant boon to our relations with the Chinese economic elite."
lng.8.a: "Our influence grows in China."
lng.8.b: "We hardly need him."

lng.9.t: "[From.GetNameDef] Accepts!"
lng.9.d: "Good news! The leaders of [From.GetNameDef] have accepted our offer. We are now aligned with them: They will support us and we will support their claim as the true Central Government of China."
lng.9.a: "Long live China!"

lng.10.t: "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses"
lng.10.d: "Our offer to support [From.GetNameDef] has been refused. While this is insulting, we may now be isolated diplomatically."
lng.10.a: "Ungrateful idiots! Disgraceful!"

lng.11.t: "Governor Chen Addresses the Provincial Assembly"
lng.11.d: "With war and chaos raging from Shandong to Fujian due to the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, Governor-General of Liangguang, Chen Jiongming, made a speech at the Guangdong Provincial Assembly today addressing a number of issues facing the province.\n\nChen assured the Assembly that neutrality in the conflict to the northwest was the only logical way forward: The stable and prosperous province of Guangdong needed to look inward and focus on improving the province and its inhabitants' livelihoods. The people needed to show the rest of China that their provincial democracy and civilian government was a model to follow, forming a believable alternative to the monarchists in the north, the warlords throughout China and the false revolutionaries of the Kuomintang. This was, Chen believes, the only way to bring peace and unite China in the long-term and rid it of tyrants once and for all."
lng.11.a: "Towards a Free China!"

lng.12.t: "Governor Chen Criticised in the Assembly"
lng.12.d: "Chen Jiongming is a staunch believer in democracy and the Guangdong Provincial Assembly is one of the few truly democratic legislatures in Asia, let alone China. Of course, this means that the Assembly is not only a place to represent the people, debate and enact policy, but also criticise the government.\n\nWith recent decisions made by Chen Jiongming's government to seek support from the gentry to the detriment of his promised land reform, a socialist member of the Assembly was quick criticise the Governor's decision, calling him out on this contradictory decision. This has hurt the Governor's credibility in the eyes of the people and strenghtened the radicals' popularity."
lng.12.a: "Such is democracy."

lng.13.t: "Peasants Request Financial Aid"
lng.13.d: "The province of Guangdong has not been spared from the consequences of Black Monday, regardless of how unwanted German influence is. The peasants have been hit particularly hard as they struggle with the decline of price for rice and grain. Elected representatives from the rural districts arrived at the Provincial Assembly to make their case, requesting financial aid to weather the storm.\n\nChen Jiongming, receiving considerable support from the peasants and rural landowners through his government policies, certainly wants to accept, but the financial situation of the province may make such a program impossible to implement and finance."
lng.13.a: "Help them, of course."
lng.13.b: "An unfortunate impossibility."

lng.14.t: "Merchant Bailouts?"
lng.14.d: "Similarly to the peasants' crisis last month, a number of wealthy merchants have hit serious financial difficulties caused by the global economic crisis. A number of members of the Provincial Assembly with ties to the merchant class of the cities and towns have made the case that the provincial government should intervene and keep these merchants from economic ruin. The influence of the merchants in Guangdong is significant and their continued political support is essential, but such a bailout would, of course, be costly."
lng.14.a: "Bail them out."
lng.14.b: "They can fend for themselves."

lng.15.t: "Joint Military Exercises"
lng.15.d: "The armies of Guangxi and Guangdong were, until recently, under separate commands. To further improve cohesion between units and officers of the two provincial armies, military exercises have been held fairly regularly. While this had significant benefits for both armies, these exercises have made it more and more obvious of how superior in quality the Guangxi Army is over its Guangdong counterpart. Even if the former is essentially subsidised by the latter's government, the manoeuvres have been, so far, excellent opportunities for the Governor of Guangxi to show off his province's military prowess."
lng.15.a: "Guangdong finances, Guangxi fights."

lng.16.t: "Suppressing Illegal Gambling"
lng.16.d: "Even since entering politics in the years before the Xinhai Revolution, Chen Jiongming has been fighting an arduous battle against gambling in the province, a problem plaguing the province along with opium addiction. In the 1920s, he managed to have it completely banned. Just as with banning the trade and consumption of opium, however, enforcing this ban has been a difficult task and removed an important source of revenue for the government. The Provincial Assembly recently began debating its effectiveness, with a faction pushing for loosening anti-gambling laws.\n\nThe Governor is adamant that this would lead to a return to moral degeneracy in Guangdong along with increased corruption without truly decreasing crime, while his opponents in the Assembly claim that the laws are wasteful and impossible to enforce, instead pushing for its re-legalisation and re-establishment of gambling taxes.\n\nGuangdong is, of course, a democracy, and the Provincial Assembly will vote on the matter."
lng.16.a: "The ban on gambling remains."
lng.16.b: "Anti-gambling legislations are loosened."

lng.17.t: "America Brings Doubt"
lng.17.d.federals: "It is no secret that Chen Jiongming's beliefs are heavily inspired by the United States of America. Or, at least, what was once the USA.\n\nThe Second American Civil War has certainly not been ignored by Chen's opponents. They see the fighting in the USA as proof that Chen Jiongming's ideals are doomed to fail as it did on the other side of the ocean. For his part, Chen reminded his opponents that his proposal for China differed significantly from the American system, and was quick to make parallels between the current states of China and the United States: Its presidential system puts too much power in the hands of the President compared to the legislature, making it no different to the current \"constitutional\" monarchy of China, while comparing \"demagogues\" such as Long and Haywood to Sun Yat-sen and Wang Jingwei - both of which are destabilising or suppressing the democratic institutions of the nation.\n\nWhile Chen Jiongming maintains that the failure of America is not inherently due to federalism or democracy, the argument made obvious the doubts that many people feel towards his proposal."

Chen was quick to point out that a significant effort had been made by Alf Landon to reach out and accommodate for both Long and Haywood, whom he has drawn parallels to Sun Yat-sen and Wang Jingwei respectively. In spite of this, both the SPA and AFP remain hell bent on undermining and destabilising the democratic institutions of the nation. Something the Chairman of the Public Interest Party insists must be prevented from happening in China at any cost.\n\nWhile Chen Jiongming maintains that the failure of America is not inherently due to federalism or democracy, the argument made obvious the doubts that many people feel towards his proposal."

lng.18.t: "Anti-Concessionist Riots in Guangzhou"
lng.18.d: "Anti-concessionist sentiments have run high in Guangdong ever since the concessions were first created. Hong Kong, Macau, and most recently the German presence in Guangzhou are all continuing, visible symbols of national humiliation that remain very personal to the people of Guangdong, the province which previously included these concessions.\n\nBlack Monday shook the hated German presence to its core, and with the League now gone, their Chinese sycophants and puppets can no longer protect them. Inspired by the riots further north, the Guangzhou anti-concessionists made their own demonstrations in the city's German quarters, which quickly turned into riots. Local police turned a blind eye while several German businesses were damaged and a German citizen was attacked and wounded. The situation was only calmed with the intervention of the Merchant Corps, which managed to disperse the demonstrators.\n\nChen Jiongming, while calling for calm, openly sympathized with the anti-concessionists and criticized both the Unequal Treaties and Beijing's inaction.\n\nThe bold statement was well-received by the people, but some cannot shake the feeling that imperialist reprisals are already on their way."
lng.18.a: "Let's hope it doesn't escalate..."

lng.19.d: "With the former League of Eight Provinces in complete flames, the German presence in China is rapidly deteriorating. The AOG and Nanking-Kommission struggle to make sense out of the chaos as they are forced to retreat to their headquarters. To make things worse, we received reports in Guangzhou that rioters attacked the German quarters there, damaging assets and assaulting a German citizen. In response, the Admiralty is preparing to retaliate by sending a squadron of destroyers to attack Guangzhou and remind the Chinese that the German Empire will not tolerate such a blatant violation of international treaties.\n\nOf course, there is no real strategic or tactical value to such an attack on a defenceless city, but it would send a message and ensure that the Chinese people and the rest of the world do not forget that Germany is a world power."
lng.19.a: "Launch a retaliatory strike."
lng.19.b: "We have bigger concerns."

lng.20.t: "German Ships Bombard Guangzhou"
lng.20.d: "As feared, German naval forces in the region launched a retaliatory strike on Guangzhou. Two destroyers entered the Pearl River Delta and, after a waiting a moment to show their flags, opened fire into the city. After firing their salvo, they remained in place for another moment before retreating back into the South China Sea.\n\nWhile damage to the city was relatively limited, the message was very clear: Germany's presence in China remains. Should the Nanjing Clique, lapdogs of the German imperialists, succeed in restoring order in the former League, we can only expect them to have significant German support when they try to retake Guangxi and Guangdong."

lng.26.t: "Labour Dispute"
lng.26.d: "Guangdong province has proven itself to be one of the most progressive in terms of labour issues. Unionization has been encouraged since the early 1920s and one of the largest of these is the Union of Machinery Workers, their strike in 1921 being one of the more well-known acts in recent memory.\n\nWith increased industrialization, it appears that another labour dispute is imminent and the Machinery Workers are threatening to go on strike once more. The Provincial Government under Chen Jiongming has been presenting itself as a mediator for disputes between workers and businessmen, which has been largely successful thus far as the Governor maintained a reasonable approach to solve these issues peacefully through compromise. It is expected that Governor Chen will ensure that a compromise is reached between the Union and the factory owner, but it is plausible that the Chamber of Commerce may use their power in the government to influence the settlement to their favour."
lng.26.a: "The settlement slightly favours the workers."
lng.26.b: "The compromise slightly favours the merchants."

lng.27.t: "Guangzhou General Strike"
lng.27.d: "Our new policy in Guangdong has been poorly received among the small, but rapidly growing, working class of the great city. Led by the Machinery Workers' Union, industrial and dock workers have taken to the streets to demonstrate, refusing to work until their demands were met.\n\nUnsurprisingly, their demands ranged from improved wages and safety conditions to better representation in the provincial government where they have been recently sidelined, if not outright banned. Of course, we could negotiate with them considering how important it is to keep the factories running, but this would require a serious change in policy, which may not be politically feasible anymore. Otherwise, armed men will be required to disperse them, which will inevitably lead to bloodshed."
lng.27.a: "Negotiate with the strikers."
lng.27.b: "Send in the troops."
lng.27.c: "Wait it out."
lng.28.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Mobilizes"
lng.28.d: "Troop movements on the border with [FROM.GetNameDef] have been reported. We can only expect the situation to escalate from here."
lng.28.a: "Get ready!"

lngcivilwar.1.t: "Lu Rongting Dies"
lngcivilwar.1.d: "Military governor of Guangxi and head of its Clique since the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, Lu Rongting peacefully passed away at the age of 77, leaving his adopted sons Lu Yuguang and Ma Ji as civilian and military governors of the province. Governor Lu had been a living symbol of the Revolution, the Republican movement, and the Warlords Era in general. Despite his early rivalry with Chen Jiongming over the control of Guangdong, the two began cooperating closely after the Qing Restoration, ensuring that Republican and anti-Qing ideals would survive. While his rule was disputed by Li Zongren, in exile in Yunnan, Lu kept Guangxi relatively stable and maintained its regional identity.\n\nWith Ma Ji securing control over the Guangxi Clique, cooperation between the two cliques of Liangguang now appears tenuous as the ambitious new warlord plots to increase his power in southern China."
lngcivilwar.1.a: "Worrying."

lnggxwar.1.t: "Li Zongren Invades!"
lnggxwar.1.d: "Baise, a city which controls the mountain pass connecting Guangxi with Yunnan and Vietnam, was attacked by Li Zongren, a right-wing general of the KMT, quickly overwhelming local defences. Our scouts report that the warlord has split his forces, part of it preparing to go down the Pearl River to attack Nanning, and another heading to Wuzhou to cut off Guangxi forces. Li, taking advantage of Lu Rongting's recent passing, clearly hopes to dislodge the current Guangxi Clique and take the province for himself once and for all in the name of the Kuomintang.\n\nMa Ji wants to attack Li in Baise before he has a chance to consolidate and move to Nanning, while Lu Yuguang wants to head north and keep Nanning from getting encircled. However, Lin Hu, one of our officers, suggests we instead fortify Nanning, claiming that our Guangdong ally won't allow Wuzhou to fall and that Li should be forced to dislodge them."
lnggxwar.1.a: "Take the fight to Li!"
lnggxwar.1.b: "Defend Wuzhou, we cannot be encircled!"
lnggxwar.1.c: "Let them come to us!"

lnggxwar.2.t: "Wuzhou falls; Ma struggles in Baise"
lnggxwar.2.d: "As expected, Wuzhou fell to Li's troops as they followed the opium trail down the Pearl River. While Li was not expecting Ma's aggressive counter-attack, his army is well-trained and they are putting a stiff fight and Ma requested reinforcements. On the other hand, Lu is worried that the enemy force in Wuzhou is exposing his flank and cutting him off from Guangdong, putting the entire province in danger if Guangdong doesn't react soon."
lnggxwar.2.a: "Ma Ji needs help; send reinforcements!"
lnggxwar.2.b: "We must secure our flank in Wuzhou first."

lnggxwar.3.t: "Li Zongren Defeated!"
lnggxwar.3.d: "After a long and bloody fight, Lu Yuguang's timely arrival forced the invading warlord to retreat. Both cliques have suffered heavy losses, but Ma Ji stands victorious, his position in Guangxi now secured from his external rival."
lnggxwar.3.a: "Victory at a cost."

lnggxwar.4.t: "Li Zongren Victorious"
lnggxwar.4.d: "Without help, Ma Ji was defeated in Baise, suffereing heavy losses before being mercilessly pursued. Meanwhile, Lu Yuguang was unable to dislodge Li's forces in Wuzhou and was forced to retreat back to Nanning, only to be destroyed on the way. With the Old Guangxi Clique destroy, Li Zongren is now undisputedly Governor of Guangxi, giving the right-wing of the KMT a base of operation."
lnggxwar.4.a: "A New Guangxi Clique."

lnggxwar.5.t: "Distraction!"
lnggxwar.5.d: "Li Zongren's attack on Wuzhou was merely a distraction meant to split Guangxi forces. With Wuzhou easily defended, Li attacked and handily defeated Ma Ji's forces in the city. With the bulk of Guangxi forces under his command, Lu Yuguang will have to retake Nanning by force, where Li has the advantage. Alternatively, he could head west to try and encircle him by taking back Baise. Of course, there is always the option to retreat to friendly Guangdong and dislodge the invaders with their help."
lnggxwar.5.a: "Head back to retake Nanning!"
lnggxwar.5.b: "Genius! Head west and cut him off!"
lnggxwar.5.c: "The war is lost, retreat!"

lnggxwar.6.t: "Lu Yuguang Repulsed"
lnggxwar.6.d: "Lu Yuguang's attempt to retake Nanning from Li Zongren, who had time to fortify his position, has failed. Unsurprisingly, what is left of Guangxi's forces have defected to Li's new clique, further empowering his right-KMT movement."
lnggxwar.6.a: "Li Zongren secures Guangxi."

lnggxwar.7.t: "Disintegration of the Guangxi Clique"
lnggxwar.7.d: "In the attempt to go up the Hongshui River, a tributary of the Pearl River, and cut off the invaders by retaking Baise, Lu Yuguang's force have desintegrated as they were quickly cut-off and destroyed near the city of Laibin. The Old Guangxi Clique is no more and its remnants have joined up with the new clique, securing Guangxi for Li Zongren's right-wing faction of the KMT."
lnggxwar.7.a: "Li Zongren is victorious."

lnggxwar.8.t: "Wuzhou Falls; Li Zongren Approaches"
lnggxwar.8.d: "News has reached Nanning that Wuzhou fell to a small task force under one of Li Zongren's subordinates, while Li himself is marching down towards Nanning. While Lu Yuguang and others are critical of our inaction and are nervous about being cut-off from Guangdong, Ma Ji believes that their opportunity to attack is long gone and they must further fortify the city. He also believes that Li has no choice but to attack as soon as possible or else risk intervention from Guangdong, while Lu counters that Guangdong will not act unless the road to Nanning is open."
lnggxwar.8.a: "Send a small force to Wuzhou."
lnggxwar.8.b: "Dig in."

lnggxwar.9.t: "Attack on Wuzhou Repulsed; Nanning Falls"
lnggxwar.9.d: "Not only has the small force to retake Nanning failed against an entrenched enemy, Nanning has fallen to Li Zongren's relentless assault on the city. The new clique's victory was costly, however, with significant damage to the city. Despite a low number of defections to his forces, Li Zongren has secured Guangxi for the rightist KMT."
lnggxwar.9.a: "A costly victory for the New Guangxi Clique"

lnggxwar.10.t: "Battle of Nanning"
lnggxwar.10.d: "Ma Ji was proven right as Li Zongren's assault on the capital of Guangxi commenced almost as soon as he arrived. Facing the full force of the Guangxi Clique, he was unable to dislodge them from their fortified positions and suffered heavy losses. When it was clear to Li that the clique had not fallen for his diversion and that he faced a disadvantageous situation, he retreated, and Ma Ji now has the chance to destroy Li's threat once and for all. However, with a portion of Li's force heading to Wuzhou as well, more cautious officers advise that they could regroup and cause trouble as bandits later, suggesting that we ask help from Guangdong to mop up Li's forces in and around Wuzhou."
lnggxwar.10.a: "Request help from Guangdong."
lnggxwar.10.b: "Pursue Li on our own."

lnggxwar.11.t: "Li Zongren Defeated"
lnggxwar.11.d: "With Guangxi forces pursuing him, Li Zongren's retreat has become more and more disorganised and turned into a rout. The invader's own whereabouts are currently unknown, but what is certain is that he is no longer a threat to Guangxi and the clique's rule is once again secure."
lnggxwar.11.a: "A decisive victory!"

lnggxwar.12.t: "Chen Mingshu's Decision"
lnggxwar.12.d: "Up until now, the Productive People's Party, led by Chen Mingshu and representing the majority of members of the Kuomintang in Liangguang, has been collaborating with Chen Jiongming's big-tent republican coalition. The Nationalists were happy to help develop and participate in democratic institutions in order to protect their interests and legacy after the failed Northern Expedition. This was with the long-term goal of peacefully implementing Mínquán, Sun Yat-sen's Principle of popular government. Besides, Chen's Federalists protected them from Zhili and Qing retribution.\n\nLi Zongren's seizure of Guangxi has completely changed the situation. While Chen Mingshu hardly trusts the rightist warlord despite both being members of the KMT, a golden opportunity presents itself: If he could get rid of Chen Jiongming, Liangguang would be secured for the Nationalist Party without bloodshed. He remains hesitant to betray him, however, after over a decade of protection and cooperation. Still, the Party's Central Committee has hatched a plan: Seize key buildings in Guangzhou and force Chen Jiongming, who has strong misgivings about fighting in the city, to surrender.\n\nAll Chen Mingshu has to do is give the order."
lnggxwar.12.a: "Li is but an untrustworthy bandit."
lnggxwar.12.b: "Start the operation."

lnggxwar.13.t: "KMT Seizes Guangzhou"
lnggxwar.13.d: "Early in the morning, under the cover of the general mobilization against Guangxi, armed members of the KMT began seizing key buildings around the city, including the Guangdong University and the Provincial Assembly Building. Soon, Chen Mingshu announced the formation of the Guangdong People's Government, the deposition of Chen Jiongming, and a call for peace with Guangxi province.\n\nAs expected, Chen Jiongming announced that, while he refused to recognize the new government, he refused to allow the city to suffer unnecessary bloodshed and destruction. He and his close supporters left for Hong Kong later that day, leaving the city in the hands of the Nationalist Party."
lnggxwar.13.a: "Bloodshed avoided."

lngcivilwar.2.t: "Lu Ronting's Funeral"
lngcivilwar.2.d: "Governor-General Chen Jiongming has been invited to former governor Lu Ronting's funeral as a guest of honour by the leadership of Guangxi. A traditional affair, Chen accepted the offer, hoping to foster greater unity between the two provinces in such trying times."
lngcivilwar.2.a: "A show of unity."

lngcivilwar.3.t: "Guarding the Body"
lngcivilwar.3.d: "As part of Chinese funeral traditions, Lu Rongting's body is on display at the former governor's residence, with family and close friends watching over the deceased. While Governor-General Chen and some close associates were part of the guard for the day, unknown assailants approached him, brandishing handguns. A firefight quickly ensued."
lngcivilwar.3.a: "The entourage is gunned down."
lngcivilwar.3.b: "The assailants fail and lay dead."

lngcivilwar.4.t: "Assassination of Chen Jiongming"
lngcivilwar.4.d: "Unable to react in time, Governor-General Chen Jiongming and his associates were gunned down by assassins under orders from Governor Ma Ji of Guangxi. News reached Guangdong quickly as Guangxi rapidly mobilised against them, but a question remains in the minds of the eastern province's leadership: Who will succeed Chen Jiongming as governor of Guangdong?\n\nChen Mingshu is an estranged member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang. While not opposed to the KMT in Fujian, he resents Wang Jingwei's authoritarian leadership of the party, being a more genuine believer in democracy than a number of party members.\n\nChen Lianbo is head of the Merchant Corps, the militia of the Chinese merchant class of Guangzhou. He has been an early opponent to the late Chen Jiongming's more socialistic and populist policies and wishes to protect the merchants' interests in the region first and foremost."
lngcivilwar.4.a: "Chen Mingshu"
lngcivilwar.4.b: "Chen Lianbo"

lngcivilwar.5.t: "Failed Attempt on Governor Chen"
lngcivilwar.5.d: "Reacting in time to their assailants, Chen Jiongming and his associates managed to escape unscathed. It was quickly realised that they were under Guangxi Governor Ma Ji and they quickly made their way out of Nanning. By the time they reached Guangdong, the Guangxi clique had already mobilised their armies, ready to take leadership of Liangguang by force. Upon his return, Governor-General Chen made an impromptu speech to the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, rallying them against the tyranical warlord of Guangxi and to defend their hard-earned liberties."
lngcivilwar.5.a: "The Dyarchy falls."

lngcivilwar.6.t: "The Second Guangdong-Guangxi War"
lngcivilwar.6.d: "The Dyarchy has fallen as the two provinces have been unable to settle their differences diplomatically. The new warlord of Guangxi is unwilling to recognise Guangdong's supremacy over Liangguang and his ambitions cannot coexist with the ideals of his eastern counterpart. Both cliques have now taken up arms; Liangguang's future will thus be settled on the battlefield."
lngcivilwar.6.a: "[GXC.GetLeader] will prevail!"
lngcivilwar.6.b: "Guangxi will take over!"

lngcivilwar.7.t: "Mobilisation of the Merchant Corps"
lngcivilwar.7.d: "The Canton Merchants' Public Safety Organization, simply known as the Merchant Corps, has mobilised their militia to help us put down the Guangxi rebels. With their interests in both provinces in danger, the merchants of Guangzhou has cast their lot on our side, giving us control over one of southern China's best troops."
lngcivilwar.7.a: "Their support is welcome."

lngcivilwar.8.t: "Mobilisation of the Rural Militia"
lngcivilwar.8.d: "A large part of both Guangxi and Guangdong's Militia Corps is under the command of the rural gentry. With their interests endangered by the ongoing conflict between the two provinces, the gentry has decided to fully support us and their militia are now under our command."
lngcivilwar.8.a: "A needed boost to our numbers."

lngcivilwar.9.t: "Rebel AI Guangxi Wins"
lngcivilwar.9.d: "You shouldn't see this. If you do, send a bug report. This is just needed as a way to circumvent how buggy vanilla civil wars are."
lngcivilwar.9.a: "Okay."

lngcivilwar.10.t: "Rebel AI Guangdong Wins"
lngcivilwar.10.d: "You shouldn't see this. If you do, send a bug report. This is just needed as a way to circumvent how buggy vanilla civil wars are."
lngcivilwar.10.a: "Okay."

lngcivilwar.11.t: "Rebel AI Guangxi Wins way too quickly"
lngcivilwar.11.d: "You shouldn't see this. If you do, send a bug report. This is just needed as a way to circumvent how buggy vanilla civil wars are."
lngcivilwar.11.a: "Okay."

lngcivilwar.12.t: "Rebel AI Guangdong Wins way too quickly"
lngcivilwar.12.d: "You shouldn't see this. If you do, send a bug report. This is just needed as a way to circumvent how buggy vanilla civil wars are."
lngcivilwar.12.a: "Okay."

lngcivilwar.13.t: "Ma Ji Secures Lianggang"
lngcivilwar.13.d: "The warlord of Guangxi is victorious over the Guangdong rebels. With the two Guangs secured, Ma Ji is now able to push his ambitions towards the rest of southern China and beyond."
lngcivilwar.13.a: "Guangxi's power grows."

lngcivilwar.14.t: "Chen Lianbo Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.14.d: "The head of the Merchant Corps, Chen Lianbo, has secured the General-Governorship of Liangguang after defeating the Guangxi rebels. Without a doubt, the new governor will focus on economic development and the protection of the Chinese merchants' interests in the region above all."
lngcivilwar.14.a: "Prosperity first."

lngcivilwar.15.t: "Chen Mingshu Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.15.d: "Chen Mingshu, head of the Productive Peoples' Party and former Kuomintang member, has defeated the Guangxi rebels and secured control of Liangguang. As Governor-General, Chen will likely align the provinces towards the KMT in Fujian and is known to support Soong Ching-ling's faction there."
lngcivilwar.15.a: "Another victory for the KMT!"

lngcivilwar.16.t: "Chen Jiongming Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.16.d: "Despite internal opposition and the revolt of the Guangxi Clique, Chen Jiongming has remained at the head of Liangguang. With his rule and popularity more secure than ever, he will have the ability to push further towards his ideals should the situation in the rest of the region allow it: A federal and truly democratic China."
lngcivilwar.16.a: "Chen will free China!"

lngcivilwar.17.t: "Reintegration of the Rebel Army"
lngcivilwar.17.d: "For the most part, the soldiers and even generals of warlord or provincial armies tended to be more concerned about defending their homes from invaders and bandits rather than matters of national importance. As such, we can reintegrate the rebel army with relative ease once their treacherous leaders are deal with. After all, they are fellow Chinese. Even if they previously served the wrong master, they can still redeem themselves or return to their homes."
lngcivilwar.17.a: "They will now serve a greater purpose."

lngcivilwar.18.t: "Old Guangxi Clique Seeks Asylum"
lngcivilwar.18.d: "Ma Ji and Lu Yuguang, leaders of the clique that formerly ruled Guangxi, have fled their homes after a power struggle. The two are old friends that once served under us during the war with the Kuomintang and they have asked to serve in our armed forces after being forced out of Guangxi, perhaps seeking a way to restore their rule someday."
lngcivilwar.18.a: "Of course, these old friends are welcome."
lngcivilwar.18.b: "They will have to find a new home elsewhere."

lngcivilwar.19.t: "Fate of Guangdong"
lngcivilwar.19.d: "Now that Guangdong is under our control, we must choose who will replace the previous provincial government. The top brass of the Clique is arguing for total exploitation of the developed province in order to fuel Guangxi's own development and, more important, fund an increasingly large and modern army. Of course, this is arguably rather short-sighted, and more politically-knowledgeable members of the Clique argue that we should hand over the provincial governments to the local elites so that the province isn't sucked dry."
lngcivilwar.19.a: "Exploit them!"
lngcivilwar.19.b: "We must be careful- let the locals handle it."

lngcivilwar.20.t: "Li Zongren Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.20.d: "Li Zongren, an estranged member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, managed to take over Liangguang by force. Unlike the KMT in Fujian, Li is a member of the party's right-wing, which was thought to have been purged by the left-wing along with Hu Hanmin's execution in 1925. The left-wing of the Kuomintang, until now uncontested leaders of the Nationalists, now have a very real threat to the Party's leadership."
lngcivilwar.20.a: "The real KMT has returned."

lngcivilwar.21.t: "Provincial KMT Leader Meet"
lngcivilwar.21.d: "With Chen Mingshu as governor of Guangdong and Li Zongren having ousted the Old Guangxi Clique, the two governors have met to discuss the future of Liangguang. The two men are essentially members of the Kuomintang, but are aligned with different factions within the party. Chen is aligned with Soong's Minquan faction while Li is de facto leader of the right-wing. While the two have differing views on how to proceed with the National Revolution, they both agree that they must form a unified government to secure the Party's position in southern China and have asked its members in the two provinces to choose their new regional leader."
lngcivilwar.21.a: "Chen Mingshu will fight for democracy."
lngcivilwar.21.b: "Unification at all costs with Li Zongren."

lngcivilwar.22.t: "Bai Chongxi Departs for Guangxi"
lngcivilwar.22.d: "Bai Chongxi left Yunnan earlier today with his men to join with his brother-in-arms, Li Zongren, in Guangxi. The latter recently became leader of the province after a power struggle with the previous clique in charge and is now in charge of the Kuomintang's right-wing in Nanning. Bai Chongxi has always been loyal to him first and foremost, and his departure was expected and unchallenged."
lngcivilwar.22.a: "Best of luck, I suppose."

lngcivilwar.24.t: "New Guangxi Clique Returns"
lngcivilwar.24.d: "Li Zongren's Clique was defeated in Guangxi and was forced into hiding. With Yunnan safely in the hands of the Kuomintang, they have returned, hoping to continue the fight with us and pledge their support and abilities to the National Revolutionary Army."
lngcivilwar.24.a: "Their revolution continues here."

lngraids.1.t: "Raiding German Indochina"
lngraids.1.d: "As the Germans are busy maintaining order in their colony, their border with us remains relatively unprotected. This makes them a prime target to raid, especially as they have poorly-defended outposts all over northern Indochina where we can easily grab supplies and equipment."
lngraids.1.a: "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.1.b: "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.2.t: "Raiding Indochina"
lngraids.2.d: "As the Indochinese War was a recent ordeal that they are still recovering from, Indochina remains a good target for raiding. There is bound to be equipment from the war that we can recover and salvage with little fear of resistance from exhausted Indochinese forces."
lngraids.2.a: "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.2.b: "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.3.t: "Raiding Yunnan"
lngraids.3.d: "The leaders of Yunnan Province have been our rivals for decades now. Their forces are formidable, but not perfect. The border between Yunnan and Guangxi is mountainous, which makes sneaking it a relatively simply affair."
lngraids.3.a: "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.3.b: "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.4.t: "Raiding Hunan"
lngraids.4.d: "Hunan has seen its fair share of trouble since the collapse of the League. While relatively stable, there are numerous factions vying for power and none of them are friendly to us. While they are distracted by internal affairs, we should strike."
lngraids.4.a: "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.4.b: "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.5.t: "Raiding the Nationalists"
lngraids.5.d: "The Nationalists have been a thorn to stability in China, which works in our favour. Their radicalism makes them inherently unstable, and we can strike them at any time as they struggle to achieve their deluded ideals."
lngraids.5.a: "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.5.b: "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.6.t: "Raiding the League"
lngraids.6.d: "The League is weak. Always was, always will be. The further from Nanjing, the easier it is for us to send raiders in, taking advantage of their internal dissention to acquire some more advanced hardware they themselves acquired from the German imperialists."
lngraids.6.a: "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.6.b: "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.7.t: "Raiding the International Concessions"
lngraids.7.d: "The imperialist Legations have been a constant symbol of humiliation for the Chinese people. Finding volunteers to send into their protected zones will be easy, and there are plenty of locals more than happy to support them against the westerners."
lngraids.7.a: "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.7.b: "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.8.t: "Raiding the German Concessions"
lngraids.8.d: "The blatantly-illegal consessions of the AOG are a great target for our raiders: The locals hate them, they have quality equipment for us to seize, and their defence forces are spread thin and unreliable. Raiding them is not only justified, but righteous."
lngraids.8.a: "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.8.b: "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.9.t: "Successful Bandit Attack"
lngraids.9.d: "One of our isolated military outposts by the border has been attacked by raiders. With chaos ruling China, we can only guess who they serve, if anyone at all. We know that they have already stolen military equipment from us, and intervening might be fruitless anyways, but it is clear that local forces will struggle to repel the raids. Regardless of whether we send troops in to help or not, we will have to secure our borders or the raids will continue."
lngraids.9.a: "Send reinforcements."
lngraids.9.b: "The local defenses will have to make due."

lngraids.10.t: "Raid Unsuccessful"
lngraids.10.d: "Our raiders returned empty-handed today. A combination of poor recon and local defenses had forced them to retreat without reaching their objective. While they have failed, they have all returned safe and sound without alerting enemy forces."
lngraids.10.a: "Too bad."

lngraids.11.t: "Failed Bandit Attack"
lngraids.11.d: "Bandits attacked one of our isolated military outposts by the border earlier today. Our troops, thankfully, managed to pull together and utterly destroy them despite the odds. These fools are certainly not returning anytime soon after our glorious forces dealt them such a crushing defeat. Sadly, we could not find out if they were acting under orders or simply bandits desperate for resources."
lngraids.11.a: "They were no match."

lngraids.12.t: "Successful Bandit Attack"
lngraids.12.d: "One of our isolated military outposts by the border has been attacked by a large band raiders. With chaos ruling China, we can only guess who they serve, if anyone at all. We know that they have already stolen a significant amount of military equipment from us, and intervening might be fruitless anyways, but it is clear that local forces will struggle to repel the raids. Regardless of whether we send troops in to help or not, we will have to secure our borders or the raids will continue."
lngraids.12.a: "We can't let them get away with this!"
lngraids.12.b: "It's too late."

lngraids.13.t: "Successful Raid"
lngraids.13.d: "Our raid has been successful. Losses were minimal and we were able to seize a decent amount of rifles and grenades from the enemy."
lngraids.13.a: "Glory to us!"

lngraids.14.t: "Disastrous Raid"
lngraids.14.d: "Our raiders were utterly defeated by local enemy troops, forcing us to retreat with serious losses. We will certainly not be able to attack them again anytime soon."
lngraids.14.a: "Damn!"

lngraids.15.t: "Very Successful Raid"
lngraids.15.d: "Our daring raid has borne fruit. Not only did they totally crush local resistance, but our raiders left with a large amount of equipment, including a number of artillery pieces. This will definitely help us reinforce our own armies while our enemies lay humiliated."
lngraids.15.a: "Glory to us!"

fedsturkwp.1.t: "Federalists Propose Ceasefire"
fedsturkwp.1.d: "After the devious Governor of Xinjiang had convinced the attendants of the Shantou Conference, we thought our cause doomend. Through the willpower of our loyal divisions, we were able to finally eject the Governor from Xinjiang, and are still prepared to defend our homeland. However, the Federalists are now making overtures towards a ceasefire. This could be due to the tenuous legitimacy the final Xinjiang Governor could claim, or due to our might. Either way, we can choose to play along to this proposal or venture forward to conquest."
fedsturkwp.1.a: "Smart Choice"
fedsturkwp.1.b: "We are not afraid!"

fedsturkwp.2.t: "Federalists Recongizes Western Neutrality"
fedsturkwp.2.d: "The Federalists have officially recognized the folly of the Governor of Xinjiang, and has denouced his act of aggression against us. This pronouncement is followed by an order to cease military action against our land. Our has shown his appreciation for this peace, and the people of the Western Gate has a repsite from our armies."
fedsturkwp.2.a: "We are glad for this understanding"

fedsturkwp.3.t: "Federalists Deny Peace Offer"
fedsturkwp.3.d: "The Federalists have denounced our government as an insurgent force trying to overthrow Chinese soverignity in Xinjiang. The Federal President has even promised his people a return to the legitimate Chinese governorship of Xinjiang, and the end to obviously alien influence in the Province. This pronouncement is followed by a reiteration of military action against us. Our leader has, in turn, denounced the manipulative Federalist movement, which acts no different than any other Southern Chinese upstart."
fedsturkwp.3.a: "They must be kidding"

lngkmt.1.t: "Kuomintang Demands our Submission"
lngkmt.1.d: "Li Zongren's Kuomintang in Guangzhou has began mobilizing his forces against us. His impossible demands were formally given to us today: Our government would submit to the KMT's Central Committee, armies absorbed into the National Revolutionary Army. In exchange, we would stay as governor of our province and its army, albeit under their supervision."
lngkmt.1.a: "Very well..."
lngkmt.1.b: "Unacceptable!"

lngkmt.2.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Submit!"
lngkmt.2.d: "[FROM.GetName] has refused our demands to submit to the Central Committee. We will now follow up our threats as the National Revolutionary Army marches into [FROM.GetNameDef]."
lngkmt.2.a: "He will pay the price."

lngkmt.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Submits!"
lngkmt.3.d: "[FROM.GetName] submitted to our pressure. His armies will be integrated into the NRA and [FROM.GetNameDef] will be under the supervision of the Central Committee."
lngkmt.3.a: "Unexpected, but welcome."

lngkmt.4.t: "Li Zongren Proclaims a New Republic"
lngkmt.4.d: "With the Leftists on the run and Li Zongren having taken control of the Kuomintang Central Committee, the expected proclamation arrived today: A new Republic of China is founded, with the National Revolutionary Army once more taking leadership of Sun Yat-sen's legacy and National Revolution. It will be an uphill battle, but it is the last hope for the Nationalists to claim victory from the jaws of defeat and free China."
lngkmt.4.a: "Long Live China!"

lngkmt.5.t: "Guangdong Elites Protest"
lngkmt.5.d: "Immediately after the proclamation came dissenting voices. The local elites of Liangguang, mainly the Gentry of the countryside and the Merchants of Guangzhou, have voiced their misgivings in a new Northern Expedition. The first one was an abject failure, with Chiang Kai-shek failing to fulfill Sun Yat-sen's dreams and the Kuomintang sapping the South of all its wealth and prosperity. The failure is quite vivid in the people's memory; the Gentry is weary of the Kuomintang's history of expropriation of demands for land reform while the Merchants keenly remember their violent purging in the Merchants' Corps Incident in 1924. The commander-in-chief is confident that the Gentry can be reassured in a timely manner, but the Merchants are far more hostile and demanding; dealing with them will likely require some sacrifices."
lngkmt.5.a: "They will toe the line soon enough."

lngkmt.6.t: "Beginning of Political Tutelage"
lngkmt.6.d: "Politcal Tutelage is the second stage in Sun Yat-sen's Three Stages of the National Revolution. With the country reunited, the National Revolutionary Army will begin to loosen their grip on power, while the Party will cement its own. This way, the Kuomintang will countinue to guide China towards the third and final stage and become a democratic republic. However, for this to succeed, the people must be educated so that they understand their civic duties and rights and participate in public institutions. This is to create a healthy democracy and avoid the failures of the Xinhai Revolution."
lngkmt.6.a: "China will be free. Eventually."

lngkmt.7.t: "Appoiting a Premier"
lngkmt.7.d: "Generalissimo Li Zongren should not be directing the National Revolution alone. As part of the reforms to create a government as outlined by Sun Yat-sen, an Executive Yuan, one of the five branches of government, will be appointed. This council will essentially act as a cabinet and its President as head of government in Western terms (as such, the President of the Executive Yuan is known as the \"Premier\" in the West).\n\nTwo choices have been presented to the Generalissimo to preside the Executive Yuan: Sun Fo, Sun Yat-sen's son, is seen as a natural candidate to reunify the factionalized Party, and Zhu Peide, one of the NRA's leaders and prominent member of the party's moderate right-wing. The first would help heal the divide within the Nationalist Party, while the second would maintain the National Revolutionary Army's political influence and the right-wing's leading role."
lngkmt.7.a: "Sun Fo will bring unity."
lngkmt.7.b: "Zhu Peide from the moderate right and the NRA."

lngkmt.8.t: "Preparatory Meeting of the Legislative Yuan"
lngkmt.8.d: "The Legislative Yuan is one of the five branches of the Republic of China's government. Currently, the body is appointed by the Chairman, Li Zongren, and acts as the country's legislature. It is assumed that when Political Tutelage ends, the body will become a proper parliament of sorts with its members elected by the people.\n\nA preparatory session opened today discussing this possibility. Debate is expected to be fierce for many members are hoping to introduce elections next year, while others do not believe that Political Tutelage should end yet and wish to postpone the decision for next year."
lngkmt.8.a: "Announce elections for next year!"
lngkmt.8.b: "The next Yuan will be appointed."

lngkmt.9.t: "Preparatory Meeting of the Legislative Yuan"
lngkmt.9.d: "The Legislative Yuan is one of the five branches of the Republic of China's government. Currently, the body is appointed by the Chairman, Li Zongren, and acts as the country's legislature. It is assumed that when Political Tutelage ends, the body will become a proper parliament of sorts with its members elected by the people.\n\nAnother preparatory session opened today discussing this possibility. Last year, the decision to elect a Legislative Yuan was delayed. A year has passed already and the debate is renewed: Should the Legislative Yuan be elected next year, or delayed once more?"
lngkmt.9.a: "Announce elections for next year!"
lngkmt.9.b: "Delay for another year."
lngkmt.9.c: "Delay indefinitely."

lngkmt.10.t: "First Election of the Legislative Yuan"
lngkmt.10.d: "The time has come. Political Tutelage is coming to an end and the next Legislative Yuan is to be elected by the people. While political activity outside of the Kuomintang remains limited, the Kuomintang's left-of-centre faction is campaigning fiercely for further reforms, adding a layer of democratic pluralism unseen in China for a long time."
lngkmt.10.a: "The Centre-Right is strenghtened."
lngkmt.10.b: "The Centre-Left gains a foothold."

lngkmt.11.t: "Legislative Yuan Election of [GetYear]"
lngkmt.11.d: "While the Kuomintang largely maintains a monopoly on politics, elections have been called to form a new Legislative Yuan. Reformists are unlikely to secure a victory, but may continue to strenghten their presence in the Republic's democratic institutions."
lngkmt.11.a: "The status quo is strenghtened."
lngkmt.11.b: "Reformists are strenghtened."

lngkmt.12.t: "Request from the Central Committee"
lngkmt.12.d: "The reorganized Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou has sent a simple request that we rejoin their ranks. This means putting ourselves under their command and supervision. For the good of the nation, of course."
lngkmt.12.a: "Of course. For the Republic!"
lngkmt.12.b: "This is encroaching on our autonomy!"

lngkmt.13.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Refuses our Request"
lngkmt.13.d: "The treacherous dogs in [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to comply! They have essentially refused to recognize the authority of the Central Committee and they shall receive the punishment befitting traitors."
lngkmt.13.a: "They will pay."

lngkmt.14.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Rejoins the Central Committee"
lngkmt.14.d: "Our friends in [FROM.GetNameDef] have, of course, accepted our request and have rejoined our ranks."
lngkmt.14.a: "For the Republic!"

lngkmt.15.t: "Integration into the Republic of China"
lngkmt.15.d: "With the consolidation of the Central Government under the Kuomintang, we are to be integrated firmly into the Republic."
lngkmt.15.a: "We will work within."

lngkmt.16.t: "[FROM.GetName] Integrated"
lngkmt.16.d: "The region under the control of [FROM.GetNameDef] has been integrated into the Republic. Our government should now be unopposed there."
lngkmt.16.a: "Excellent!"

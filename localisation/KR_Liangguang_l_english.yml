GXC_align_with_japan_desc:0 "With China ravaged by radicalism and warlordism, the economy is guaranteed to fall into shambles once more. Japan, however, is now the key to stability for the country. Chen Lianbo has pro-Japanese sympathies and he believes in their Panasian ideal. After all, they are now the only chance to finally bring peace, and it would be in our best interests to strike a good deal with them first before the Imperial Japanese Army marches into Guangzhou."

GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_SZC:0 "The province of Sichuan has seen terrible blights after terrible blights. Famine, warlords, bandits, and so on. Perhaps the United Provinces can bring stability to the troubled province and restore the people's faith?"
GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_LEP:0 "There is irony to be noted that we are able to pressure the old leaders of the League that tried to destroy us. While we expect nothing from the so-called League Marshal, it is simply better to extend an olive branch first to show our good faith."
GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_ANQ:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan is definitely a man to be respected and his anti-concessionist stance is admirable. While we are unsure of his actual character, there is a chance he could be pulled over to our cause and limit bloodshed among countrymen."

GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_SHX:0 "Yan Xishan is a peculiar man to say the least. We certainly cannot say that he is a Federalist, but it is clear that the CZGP has influenced his leadership.

GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_YUN:0 "Yunnan is known as a republican stronghold, but its governor may not be wise enough to see our movement as allies. Warlords must be eliminated and power returned to the people."

The first war took place in 1920 between Lu Rongting and Chen Jiongming after the former broke with Sun Yat-sen, which the latter still supported at that point. The war was brief, resulting in Chen Jiongming's forces securing Guangdong for the KMT and Lu Rongting was unable to counter-attack. \n\nThe Liangguang Dyarchy was short-lived, as the leaders of two provinces can no longer see eye-to-eye.

### Ideas ###
GXC_backwards_guangxi:0 "Guangxi's Struggling Economy"
GXC_backwards_guangxi_desc:0 "The economy of the province of Guangxi is being sucked dry by the heavy militarization of its governing clique, as most funds are funneled into the provincial military. The rate of military spending has become quite unsustainable and the economy suffers as a result. Additional income sources or serious economic reforms may be required to alleviate the situation."

GXC_AOG_leftovers:0 "Anti-Concessionist Wave"
GXC_AOG_leftovers_desc:0 "With Black Monday and the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, the hated AOG, the association of German merchants in China, is in freefall. The German imperialists, seemingly unable to recoup their losses and left in hostile territory, are trying to flee and anti-concessionists in Guangzhou are taking full advantage of it. Rioting may break out soon, which could cause a diplomatic incident if the German presence in the city is attacked. For the time being, Chinese businessmen are happily buying our failed or failing German assets in Southern China, increasing their own influence and power in the region."

GXC_bailing_out_peasants:0 "Financial Aid for Peasants"
GXC_bailing_out_peasants_desc:0 "The Provincial Government has taken measures to help rural peasants cope with the ongoing economic crisis."

GXC_guangxi_militarism:0 "Guangxi Militarism"
GXC_guangxi_militarism_desc:0 "Militarism has been prominent in Guangxi for centuries and the military prowess of its people are well-known throughout China. It is only natural that we are tapping into this powerful situation in order to advance our ambitions."

GXC_militia_corps:0 "Militia Corps"
GXC_militia_corps_desc:0 "The term Militia Corps refers to units of militia levied from small towns and villages to serve as anti-bandit forces or, sometimes, as a reserve force. These are typically led and equiped by the local gentry and notable. This means that many people in rural areas have some kind of military experience, expanding our pool of potential recruits."

GXC_militarised_guangxi:0 "Militarised Guangxi"
GXC_militarised_guangxi_desc:0 "Guangxi Province has been thoroughly militarized in order to serve the ambitions of the ruling clique. The province only exists to support the provincial forces, as if the army was the state itself."

GXC_roar_of_wolftroops:0 "Roar of the Wolf Troops"
GXC_roar_of_wolftroops_desc:0 "The Lang Bing, or Wolf Troops, were a special military unit of the Ming Dynasty comprised of elite troops from the southern provinces, especially Guangxi. They were ferocious and brutal, which was perfect for its intended role of suppressing dissent and foreign raiders. Their legacy lives on along with Guangxi's fearsome reputation of having the best soldiery in China, and the people have embraced that identity."

GXC_mountaineers:0 "Mountaineer Training"
GXC_mountaineers_desc:0 "The people of southern China are familiar with its mountains. Naturally, this means that many of our soldiers are already used to the intricacies and dangers of mountain warfare, making us able to create a strong force of mountaineers to defend our homeland."

GXC_factionalism:0 "Increased Factionalism"
GXC_factionalism_desc:0 "The collapse of the League of Eight Provinces has created a power vacuum in the region. While Liangguang is being mostly spared from the armed conflict to succeed the League, many factions within the region have taken this as a signal to push their agenda while ambitious men look for any potential openings towards power."

GXC_divided_military:0 "Divided Military"
GXC_divided_military_desc:0 "The provincial armies of Guangdong and Guangxi have been independent of each other since the Xinhai Revolution with few exceptions until the Kuomintang's failed revolt.

GXC_warlord_economy:0 "Warlordist Economy"
GXC_warlord_economy_desc:0 "The economy has only one use: To supply and support the governor's forces. The government is quite unscrupulous about adding revenue to support military spending and this will likely have serious long-term socio-economic consequences as the number of opium and gambling addicts continue to rise, but the army needs money and it needs it now."

GXC_modernising_guangxi:0 "Modernising Guangxi"

GXC_suppressing_bandits_desc:0 "Banditry is rampant in Guangxi. Supressing it will be a long and tough process, but it must be done in order to bring back order and safety to the province. Any mondernization attempt is bound to fail if those basic needs of the populace are not fulfilled."

GXC_officer_vanguards_idea:0 "Officer Vanguards"
GXC_officer_vanguards_idea_desc:0 "China has almost unlimited manpower, but numbers alone does not necessarily win wars as very few soldiers are educated and even less have military experience.

GXC_professional_officers:0 "Professional Officers"
GXC_professional_officers_desc:0 "China has almost unlimited manpower, but officers are needed to lead these soldiers, usually uneducated peasants conscripted from small towns and villages.

GXC_legacy_of_the_army_of_steel_idea_desc:0 "The Army of Steel is the nickname of the Kuomintang's Seventh Army during the Northern Expedition. These men, mostly from Guangxi, proved themselves as the most capable soldiers of the south, scoring numerous victories, even while facing the Jade Marshall himself. Despite the KMT's revolution failing, the legacy of the Steel Army lives on."

GXC_reforming_guangdong_one:0 "Financial Reform in Guangdong"
GXC_reforming_guangdong_one_desc:0 "Because of encroachment from the A.O.G. for over a decade, the finances of Guangdong Province have been struggling to compensate for the losses they caused. While Chen Jionming has been successful in resurecting the economy after years of mismanagement from the KMT, there is still much to be done to restore the province to its former glory."

GXC_literacy_campaign:0 "Literacy Campaign"
GXC_literacy_campaign_desc:0 "It is clear that one of the major reasons why the West is so prosperous is its high literacy rate. Since literacy is abysmally low in China, we can never hope to become equals to the rest of the world until we improve it, or else we will remain inferior to them."

GXC_decentralisation:0 "Decentralisation"
GXC_decentralisation_desc:0 "Chen Jiongming is adamant that decentralisation is the best way to govern a country as large as China. Centralisation brings too much power to too few people, which inevitably leads to corruption and autocracy. If China is to be united and prosperous, the division of power between the central government and the provinces, and between the province and the counties, must be clear. Through provincial self-rule, democracy can be introduced to China from the bottom up, and only with democracy can the people of China truly be free."

GXC_land_reform:0 "Land to the Tiller Program"

The Northern Expedition may have failed, but the KMT remains underground and a powerful force in Liangguang. Chen Mingshu's Productive People's Party serves as a front for the remnants of the National Revolutionary's Fourth Army and the region's social-democratic politicians of the Party. Wang Jingwei's faction of the Central Committee, however, is quite weak, most of the members in Liangguang favouring Song Qingling's Populists.§!"

GXC_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Public Interest Party\n§gThe Zhongguo Zhigongdang, or China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party of China) is the main political party of the Federalist movement in China. Founded in 1925, the party united disilusioned Kuomintang politicians and Overseas Chinese (especially Freemasons of the Hongmen), calling for the reform of the Republic of China into a proper federal state and multiparty democracy. While these hopes were quickly dashed by the Qing Restoration, they remain a significant force, albeit banned in Qing/Zhili-controlled lands for their explicit republicanism. Their platform, outside of federalism and republican democracy, expouses progressive social and political views from land and education reform to elected assemblies for all government levels.§!"

While the League attracted fairly little attention, it became Chen's formal coalition in the Guangdong Provincial Assembly. The league is wide and unwieldy, containing federalists of all colours, Kuomintang remnants, business and gentry interests, and even syndicalists. With the collapse of the League, the coalition is on the verge of collapse as they barely share a common platform in maintaing stability in Guangdong, let alone republicanism.§!"

Founded in 1912, the businessmen of the city organized and funded their own self-defence capabilities as the province descended into warlordism and banditry. The Merchant Corps rose up against the Kuomintang in 1924, convinced that they were spreading syndicalism, but were utterly crushed. Chen Lianbo, its leader from the beginning, fled to Hong Kong, only returning after the failed Northern Expedition. As part of Chen Jiongming's coalition, the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce and its paramilitary represent business interests in the province, their anti-union stance forcing the coalition to water-down progressive legislation, creating great tension.§!"

It is the union of two provinces, Guangxi in the west and Guangdong in the east, and their governemnts remain separate and largely independent of each other. This union, so far, remains an informal one, and steps should be made to formalise it under the recreated position of Governor-General of Liangguang."

### Guangxi Development

GXC_Guangxi_Construction_Plan_desc:0 "Out of the two provinces consisting Liangguang, Guangxi is the one clearly lagging behind in economic development.

GXC_Get_Some_Money:0 "Get Some Money"
GXC_Get_Some_Money_desc:0 "It may seem obvious, but the leaders of Guangxi are soldiers, not economists. The large army the Clique maintains needs to be funded, and there is a limit on how much Guangdong is willing to spare to prop them up. Funds must be acquired if Guangxi's ambitions are to be fulfilled."

GXC_Warlordist_Economy:0 "Warlordist Economy"
GXC_Warlordist_Economy_desc:0 "Many provincial military governments in China have lackluster economies due to the very nature of their regimes, with every bit of wealth funnelled into the army.

GXC_Opium_Smuggling:0 "Opium Smuggling"
GXC_Opium_Smuggling_desc:0 "It is no secret that Guangxi, like many provinces, have a serious opium problem. On the other hand, a major opium trade route courses through the province and the Clique profits from it greatly. Since we need these profits to expand and maintain our army, we must expand these smuggling operations, even if embracing this sin will be frowned upon by many."

GXC_Economic_Modernization:0 "Economic Modernisation"
GXC_Economic_Modernization_desc:0 "Guangxi cannot continue to depend on the awful opium trade any longer. It is not only an addiction for many Chinese, but also for the provincial administration in order to fund its operations.

GXC_Financial_Reorganization:0 "Financial Reorganisation"

GXC_Develop_Terrace_Field_desc:0 "Terrace fields are certainly nothing new in Southern China. Guangxi especially, where its rough terrain makes it an outright necessity in many parts of the province. Still, they are not easy technical feats and require significant investment before farmers can work them. After all, Guangxi is still very agrarian and there is little reason to believe that this will change in the near future."

GXC_Enlighten_Minorities_desc:0 "Guangxi is home to many ethnic minorities.

GXC_Wolf_Troops:0 "Wolf Troops"
GXC_Wolf_Troops_desc:0 "Wolf Troops were special auxiliary troops from Guangxi during the Ming Dynasty. These troops quickly became notorious for their ferocity, violence and, more importantly, successes on the battlefield. They were often used to suppressed local rebellions and foreign excursions. Since then, the term has remained part of the Guangxi spirit to denote the province's elite soldiers."

GXC_Mountain_Battle_Training:0 "Mountain Warfare Training"
GXC_Mountain_Battle_Training_desc:0 "The terrain of Guangxi is rough and mountains are prevalent.

GXC_Militarized_Society:0 "Militarised Society"
GXC_Militarized_Society_desc:0 "Guangxi has been known for militarism for a very long time and this was only further entrenched since the Xinhai Revolution. The province is becoming thoroughly militarised, which is a good thing considering our ambitions in the region."

GXC_Sparta_of_the_East:0 "Sparta of the East"
GXC_Sparta_of_the_East_desc:0 "Sparta is well-known to many Westerners: A highly-militarised society that prized martial prowess over everything else, where war dominated every aspect of Spartan life.

GXC_tooling_help:0 "Extra Tooling Help"

GXC_second_arsenal_desc:0 "The Paijang Artillery Factory, also known as the Second Guangdong Arsenal, was built in 1933 with help from Siemmsen & Co. and the AOG. It recently began producing field artillery and ammunition for the League until it collapsed. With government help, it can be expanded and ensure it remains out of German hands."

GXC_improved_communications:0 "Acquire Radios"
GXC_improved_communications_desc:0 "Logistics and communications are instrumental in modern warfare.

GXC_specialized_artillery:0 "Specialized AA/AT Guns"
GXC_specialized_artillery_desc:0 "While air and armoured power remains fairly limited in China, their presence is steadily growing and we must adopt countermeasures to deal with them effectively.

GXC_Liangguang_Aviation_Bureau:0 "Liangguang Aviation Bureau"
GXC_Liangguang_Aviation_Bureau_desc:0 "Both provinces have a tiny aviation industry spurred by the demands of the provincial armies and their leaders. While this industry may be insignificant to foreign eyes, it is an incredible boon compared to most Chinese provincial governments. The two provinces should pool their resources and expertise together to maintain the significant advantage military aviation brings to the modern battlefield."

The Guangxi Type 3, a biplane of mixed construction, is one of the first successful fighters made in China, while Shaoguan is working on a modern monoplane they named \"Rejuvenation-type\". They could become the backbone of our air force and give us an immeasurable advantage over our foes."

GXC_northern_doctrine:0 "Northern Doctrine: Firepower"
GXC_northern_doctrine_desc:0 "The Chinese armies in the north have developed their own doctrine based on firepower from their experiences fighting in the North China Plain. Considering we are likely to be fighting the Northerners on their own turf, it would be wise to adopt their ideas and experiences for our own forces as we continue to rebuilt and reform our armies."

GXC_southern_doctrine:0 "Southern Doctrine: Mobility"
GXC_southern_doctrine_desc:0 "The fighting in Southern China since the Xinhai Revolution has mainly revolved around highly mobile infantry forces focusing on mobility and maintaining a manpower advantage. Since we are certainly going to be defending ourselves from attackers, we should continue to adapt from our own lessons fighting in the South, where our troops already fight best."

GXC_reopen_whampoa:0 "Professional Officer Corps"
GXC_reopen_whampoa_desc:0 "Professionalism among the officers of Chinese armies is hard to come by since many of them are former bandits. However, Liangguang has seen a steadily increasing literacy rate, which gives us an advantage when recruiting and training new officers. We must strive for professionalization so that our officers can be the true defenders of the Republic and not an army trained from the \"Green School\"."

GXC_militia_integration:0 "Militia Integration"
GXC_militia_integration_desc:0 "Armies in Southern China since the creation of the Qing New Armies in the late 19th century have essentially been large militia forces. Integrating them into our army structure will ensure that we have access to motivated and experienced manpower, eager to defend their homes from warlords and bandits."

GXC_minjun_reforms:0 "Minjun Reforms"
GXC_minjun_reforms_desc:0 "Minjun, or citizen/popular armies, are the name used to denote volunteer soldiers in Southern Armies. They have a mixed reputation to say the least, as the Kuomintang derided them as bandits in their propaganda. We must reform this force, as citizen-soldiers will be the backbone of an effective army that will defend the republic just as they did in the United States and Britain."

GXC_civilwar_lessons_desc:0 "The Yue-Gui Wars, shorthand for the Guangdong-Guangxi Wars, refer to a number of conflicts between Guangdong and Guangxi province since the Xinhai Revolution. Our forces still have much to learn when it comes to modern warfare, and the most recent war will be examined and studied in order to improve our armies, for the wars in China appear to have no end in sight."

GXC_modern_army_structure_desc:0 "Chinese armies differ significantly from modern Western armies despite decades of attempting to emulate them. Unsurprisingly, a modern army structure is a necessity to properly conduct wars, and the Chief of Staff has presented a new system to organize infantry divisions."

GXC_improved_logistics:0 "Improved Logistics"

GXC_mountain_warfare_desc:0 "Southern China has no shortages of rough terrain with the Nanling Mountains covering the northern region of Liangguang.

GXC_proper_recon:0 "Reconnaissance Training"
GXC_proper_recon_desc:0 "Recon and intelligence has always been a staple of a competent army.

GXC_modern_forts:0 "Fortifications Study"
GXC_modern_forts_desc:0 "It seems inevitable that war will be coming to us at some point as we are surrounded by hostile rivals. Fortifications in modern war have a mixed reputation, but the proper and reasonable use of static fortifications can help deter enemies from certain areas, funnel them into certain chokepoints, or create difficult obstacles on strategic points."

GXC_federal_army:0 "Recreate the Guofangjun"
GXC_federal_army_desc:0 "The Guofangjun, or National Defense Army, was first formed by Chen Jiongming in 1920.

GXC_fourth_army:0 "The Iron Army's Legacy"
GXC_fourth_army_desc:0 "The Iron Army is the nickname of the 4th Army of the Republic of China. These men from Guangdong formed the core of the KMT's forces during the Northern Expedition, quickly becoming known as one of its most capable units. As this army was essentially created from Chen Jiongming's Guangdong Army, their legacy is maintained to this day as a highly mobile and competent army despite the Expedition's failure."

GXC_Officer_Vanguards:0 "Officer Vanguards"
GXC_Officer_Vanguards_desc:0 "Officer Vanguards are units consisting purely of veteran NCOs and officers to serve as a vanguard to the army. Instead of spreading our officers thin to lead poorly-trained and inexperienced units, we can instead concentrate them in their own units, where their experience and skill will make them useful in daring assaults."

GXC_Professional_Officer_Corps:0 "Professional Officer Corps"
GXC_Professional_Officer_Corps_desc:0 "Professionalising the officer corps will ensure that our divisions are led by trained and talented officers.

GXC_french_advisors_desc:0 "Military advisors from France were present before and during the Northern Expedition. Now that we are (at least, on paper) aligned with the Kuomintang's Central Committee, we can expect French advisors to join us once more and ensure that our military forces are properly prepared and trained.

Limiting military spending (significantly more than any other provincial government) and the relative stability of the last decade has allowed the province to succeed where other provinces failed. Still, Guangdong has so much more potential, and we should work to improve it further."

GXC_Financial_Reform:0 "Financial Reform"

GXC_New_Industrial_Zones:0 "New Industrial Zones"
GXC_New_Industrial_Zones_desc:0 "The AOG presence in Guangzhou seriously hampered the Provincial Government's finances and economic development.

GXC_Infrastructral_Efforts:0 "Infrastructural Efforts"
GXC_Infrastructral_Efforts_desc:0 "Infrastructure in China is notoriously underdeveloped. Railways are still rare; the main rail line from Guangzhou to Beijing still remains incomplete for example.

GXC_Local_Investment:0 "Local Investment"

GXC_Consolidate_Local_Support:0 "Consolidate Local Support"
GXC_Consolidate_Local_Support_desc:0 "Chen Jiongming was able to maintain his governorship for so long by appealing to the local elites despite his relatively radical political agenda.

GXC_Republican_United_Front:0 "Republican United Front"
GXC_Republican_United_Front_desc:0 "Chen Jiongming is an ardent republican and has worked with many colourful types in his tenure from anarchists and the KMT to liberals and conservatives.

GXC_Education_Reform_focus:0 "Education Reform"
GXC_Education_Reform_focus_desc:0 "Education remains poor compared to global standards and its improvement is one of the main concerns of the Public Interest Party.

GXC_Expand_Yue_University_desc:0 "The University of Guangdong was founded in 1921 during Chen Jiongming's first tenure as Governor of Guangdong and it was the cornerstone of his Provincial Education Committee.

GXC_Professional_Training_School:0 "Professional Training School"

GXC_Massive_Literacy_Campaign_desc:0 "Illiteracy has plagued us for too long. If China is to prosper again, then every Chinese must be educated so that it can participate in its improvement. After all, how can the Chinese people be free if they cannot read and make decisions for themselves?"

GXC_County_Self_Governmence:0 "County Self-Governance"
GXC_County_Self_Governmence_desc:0 "Chen Jiongming, along with many prominent Chinese reformers, understand that China is too large to be governed like a unitary state, and rearranging the government along federalist lines would help alleviate many of its ills related to the Central Government. This must be done Bottom-Up, not Top-Down, and must begin in the traditionally-autonomous counties, where democracy can strive."

GXC_Land_to_the_Tiller:0 "Land to the Tiller"
GXC_Land_to_the_Tiller_desc:0 "Land reform has been central to the Public Interest Party's platform, but has encountered serious opposition from the very beginning.

GXC_Promote_Self_Organization:0 "Promote Self-Organisation"
GXC_Promote_Self_Organization_desc:0 "Self-Organisation is one of the core tenets of Chen Jiongming's ideology. Democracy is not possible if the people isn't free, and the people cannot be free if they aren't politically self-ruling and economically independent. The key to democracy in China will be to organise the people to be able to fight corruption and authoritarianism."

GXC_Enlightened_Gentry_Dominance:0 "Enlightened Gentry Dominance"
GXC_Enlightened_Gentry_Dominance_desc:0 "Landowners dominate the rural counties of Liangguang and have serious influence in the Provincial Assembly.

This will not be a popular move among reformers, however."

GXC_Expand_Nanning_Academy_desc:0 "The Nanning Military Academy dates from pre-Revolutionary times, training a large number of NCOs from Southern China, and the majority of Guangxi officers are graduates.

GXC_Lu_Rontings_Legacy_desc:0 "Lu Rongting was a brilliant man. Not only in military matters, but in personal relations and his eye for talent unmatched.

GXC_End_Labor_Movement:0 "Suppress the Labour Movement"
GXC_End_Labor_Movement_desc:0 "The labour movement in Guangdong has grown along with industrialisation, protected by Chen Jiongming's socialist policies.

After all, can these puppets of the Western Syndicalist powers be trusted in the first place?"

Besides, it's very good PR."

GXC_Merchants_Fight_Bandits_desc:0 "Banditry in Guangxi has been a thorn for the region's development. Their very presence is enough to hamper economic growth, something the Chamber of Commerce can no longer tolerate, and the Merchant Corps will ensure that trade is protected in the region."

GXC_Chinese_Washington:0 "The Chinese Washington"
GXC_Chinese_Washington_desc:0 "During the Merchant Corps Uprising, a Western commentator in Hong Kong described Chen Lianbo as the \"Chinese Washington\".

GXC_Southern_Reconstruction_Plan_desc:0 "During the 1920s, Chen Jiongming wrote an ambitious Reconstruction Plan for China, hoping to bridge the gap between the warring factions and reunite the country, and this was adopted by several other provincial governors at the time.

GXC_Civilian_Guangxi:0 "Restore Civilian Control in Guangxi"
GXC_Civilian_Guangxi_desc:0 "For too long, Guangxi has been controlled by power-hungry, irresponsible militarists that have sapped to province of all its wealth and happiness.

lng.1.t:0 "The Situation in Liangguang"
lng.1.d:0 "With the League of Eight Provinces falling into open warfare to secure Nanjing, Chen Jiongming, the Governor of Guangdong, announced the immediate secession of the province from the League. Denouncing the League as corrupt and unable to protect the rights and welfare of the people, he was followed suit by Governor Lu Rongting of Guangxi in the west. Accordingly, the provincial assemblies of Guangdong and Guangxi held a joint meeting in Guangzhou, electing Chen Jiongming as Extraordinary Governor-General of Liangguang.\n\nWhile the \"Two Guangs\" are united in defence against bandits, the ambition of Warlords from the disintegrating League, this new union of provinces is already proving to be struggling. The leaders of Guangdong and Guangxi are only united by pragmatism, the two having widely different aims for the region, let alone China as a whole. Lu Rongting leads a highly militarized province, while Chen leads a varied republican coalition in one of the few functioning democracies in all of China.\n\nLiangguang may avoid the bloodshed of the collapse of the League, but it will not avoid the consequences of Beijing's failure to keep China vaguely united."
lng.1.a:0 "Governor Chen will see us through."
lng.1.b:0 "Tell me more about Liangguang."
lng.1.c:0 "What about all these factions?"

lng.101.t:0 "Briefly Introducing Liangguang"
lng.101.d:0 "Liangguang, or \"Two Guangs\", is a geographical term representing the provinces of Guangxi in the west and Guangdong in the east. The Viceroyalty of Liangguang was first created during the Ming Dynasty, but would be dissolved and reformed numerous times until its final dissolution in 1911. Its official name was the lengthy \"Governor-General, Commander and Quartermaster, Supervisor of Waterways, and Inspector-General of the Two Expanses (Guangs) and Surrounding Areas\".\n\nGuangdong province is one of the most wealthy and developed parts of China, with Guangzhou rivaling Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. However, its recent history is marred with warfare and destruction, with the province losing Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhouwan to Western imperialists in the 19th century, while the Xinhai Revolution eventually brought further ruin by numerous wars between warlords and the turbulent rule of the Kuomintang. Since the failure of the Northern Expedition in 1926, the province has been governed Chen Jiongming and has seen a remarkable recovery and growth, developing a young provincial democracy in the process.\n\nGuangxi, meanwhile, has been ruled by Lu Rongting, who is seen as the quintessential warlord. The province has been highly militarized and its soldiers are well-known across China to be some of the best. However, this high level of militarization has been costly, and the wealthier Guangdong has been essentially keeping the Guangxi Army afloat, creating an interdependent relationship between the two provinces as Guangxi troops often supplement the smaller Guangdong Army."
lng.101.a:0 "Governor Chen will see us through."
lng.101.b:0 "What about all these factions?"

lng.102.t:0 "Factionalism in Liangguang"
lng.102.d:0 "While Chen Jiongming currently leads a wide coalition of republicans, the Grand Republican League, it contains numerous factions outside of his own political party.\n\nThe Public Interest Party, or Zhigongdang, was founded in 1925 by Chen Jiongming and his ally, Tang Jiyao. Its ideology can be compared to western social-democracy, wanting to improve civil and workers' rights throughout China. Mainly, however, it is the most important Federalist party in the country, calling for the Central government to be reorganized as a federal republic and multiparty democracy.\n\nThe Productive People's Party, led by Chen Mingshu, is essentially a front-organization for the moderate-left Kuomintang in Guangdong. While also social-democratic like the Federalists, they differ as the PPP's ideology and philosophy is based on Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and his teachings. Their major obstacle in working closer with the Federalists is the bad history between the two parties' founders, who violently split before the Northern Expedition.\n\nWhile not a political party, the Merchants' Public Safety Organization, the paramilitary organization of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, is highly influential. Led by Chen Lianbo, their main goal is to protect businesses and trade from bandits and irresponsible politicians. They have noticeable ties with Hong Kong and German businessmen, making them a target of local anti-concessionists as the AOG struggles to recoup their massive losses from Black Monday and the League Collapse.\n\nIn Guangxi, the provincial assembly is little but a rubber-stamping one for the Army. As such, there is little open opposition to the Guangxi Clique from political groups. The Clique's main enemies currently hide in Yunnan as Li Zongren patiently waits for his chance to strike and retake the province for his own Clique aligned with the right-wing of the Kuomintang."

As such, the two have been cooperating since the dawn of the League in the first place, working together to secure the region's autonomy from Nanjing and, consequently, Beijing.\n\nThe two governors have thus agreed to stay neutral in the conflict in the former League and focus inward instead."

Now that he has secured Southern China, he wishes to bring Liangguang back into the fold, which would give us a strong ally in a notoriously rebellious region of the country. Of course, that means he would have significant autonomy from Beijing and we will have to ensure he is protected from rivals in the region."

lng.11.d:0 "With war and chaos raging from Shandong to Fujian due to the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, Governor-General of Liangguang, Chen Jiongming, made a speech at the Guangdong Provincial Assembly today addressing a number of issues facing the province.\n\nChen assured the Assembly that neutrality in the conflict to the northwest was the only logical way forward: The stable and prosperous province of Guangdong needed to look inward and focus on improving the province and its inhabitants' livelihoods. The people needed to show the rest of China that their provincial democracy and civilian government was a model to follow, forming a believable alternative to the monarchists in the north, the warlords throughout China and the false revolutionaries of the Kuomintang. This was, Chen believes, the only way to bring peace and unite China in the long-term and rid it of tyrants once and for all."
lng.11.a:0 "Towards a Free China!"

lng.12.t:0 "Governor Chen Criticised in the Assembly"
lng.12.d:0 "Chen Jiongming is a staunch believer in democracy and the Guangdong Provincial Assembly is one of the few truly democratic legislatures in Asia, let alone China. Of course, this means that the Assembly is not only a place to represent the people, debate and enact policy, but also criticise the government.\n\nWith recent decisions made by Chen Jiongming's government to seek support from the gentry to the detriment of his promised land reform, a socialist member of the Assembly was quick criticise the Governor's decision, calling him out on this contradictory decision. This has hurt the Governor's credibility in the eyes of the people and strenghtened the radicals' popularity."
lng.12.a:0 "Such is democracy."

lng.13.t:0 "Peasants Request Financial Aid"
lng.13.d:0 "The province of Guangdong has not been spared from the consequences of Black Monday, regardless of how unwanted German influence is. The peasants have been hit particularly hard as they struggle with the decline of price for rice and grain. Elected representatives from the rural districts arrived at the Provincial Assembly to make their case, requesting financial aid to weather the storm.\n\nChen Jiongming, receiving considerable support from the peasants and rural landowners through his government policies, certainly wants to accept, but the financial situation of the province may make such a program impossible to implement and finance."
lng.13.a:0 "Help them, of course."
lng.13.b:0 "An unfortunate impossibility."

lng.14.t:0 "Merchant Bailouts?"
lng.14.d:0 "Similarly to the peasants' crisis last month, a number of wealthy merchants have hit serious financial difficulties caused by the global economic crisis. A number of members of the Provincial Assembly with ties to the merchant class of the cities and towns have made the case that the provincial government should intervene and keep these merchants from economic ruin. The influence of the merchants in Guangdong is significant and their continued political support is essential, but such a bailout would, of course, be costly."
lng.14.a:0 "Bail them out."
lng.14.b:0 "They can fend for themselves."

lng.15.t:0 "Joint Military Exercises"
lng.15.d:0 "The armies of Guangxi and Guangdong were, until recently, under separate commands. To further improve cohesion between units and officers of the two provincial armies, military exercises have been held fairly regularly. While this had significant benefits for both armies, these exercises have made it more and more obvious of how superior in quality the Guangxi Army is over its Guangdong counterpart. Even if the former is essentially subsidised by the latter's government, the manoeuvres have been, so far, excellent opportunities for the Governor of Guangxi to show off his province's military prowess."
lng.15.a:0 "Guangdong finances, Guangxi fights."

lng.16.t:0 "Suppressing Illegal Gambling"
lng.16.d:0 "Even since entering politics in the years before the Xinhai Revolution, Chen Jiongming has been fighting an arduous battle against gambling in the province, a problem plaguing the province along with opium addiction. In the 1920s, he managed to have it completely banned. Just as with banning the trade and consumption of opium, however, enforcing this ban has been a difficult task and removed an important source of revenue for the government. The Provincial Assembly recently began debating its effectiveness, with a faction pushing for loosening anti-gambling laws.\n\nThe Governor is adamant that this would lead to a return to moral degeneracy in Guangdong along with increased corruption without truly decreasing crime, while his opponents in the Assembly claim that the laws are wasteful and impossible to enforce, instead pushing for its re-legalisation and re-establishment of gambling taxes.\n\nGuangdong is, of course, a democracy, and the Provincial Assembly will vote on the matter."

For his part, Chen reminded his opponents that his proposal for China differed significantly from the American system, and was quick to make parallels between the current states of China and the United States: Its presidential system puts too much power in the hands of the President compared to the legislature, making it no different to the current \"constitutional\" monarchy of China, while comparing \"demagogues\" such as Long and Haywood to Sun Yat-sen and Wang Jingwei - both of which are destabilising or suppressing the democratic institutions of the nation.\n\nWhile Chen Jiongming maintains that the failure of America is not inherently due to federalism or democracy, the argument made obvious the doubts that many people feel towards his proposal."

Inspired by the riots further north, the Guangzhou anti-concessionists made their own demonstrations in the city's German quarters, which quickly turned into riots. Local police turned a blind eye while several German businesses were damaged and a German citizen was attacked and wounded. The situation was only calmed with the intervention of the Merchant Corps, which managed to disperse the demonstrators.\n\nChen Jiongming, while calling for calm, openly sympathized with the anti-concessionists and criticized both the Unequal Treaties and Beijing's inaction.\n\nThe bold statement was well-received by the people, but some cannot shake the feeling that imperialist reprisals are already on their way."

In response, the Admiralty is preparing to retaliate by sending a squadron of destroyers to attack Guangzhou and remind the Chinese that the German Empire will not tolerate such a blatant violation of international treaties.\n\nOf course, there is no real strategic or tactical value to such an attack on a defenceless city, but it would send a message and ensure that the Chinese people and the rest of the world do not forget that Germany is a world power."

lng.21.a:0 "A relief, to say the least."

lng.22.t:0 "Squadron Returns from Guangzhou"
lng.22.d:0 "After engaging in a bit of \"gunboat diplomacy\" in Guangzhou, the squadron has returned safely after a successful mission. The Chinese will certainly not forget this one until the Nanking-Kommission can sort their mess in China."
lng.22.a:0 "Mission Accomplished."

lng.23.t:0 "The Liangguang KMT and the Central Committee"
lng.23.d:0 "The Kuomintang in Liangguang has been isolated since the end of the Northern Expedition. In order to survive, they have been working in the Provincial Government under the name of the Productive People's Party while the KMT rightists have been hiding in Yunnan. Now that they have secured Guangdong and Guangxi for the Party, they have made an official request to rejoin the ranks of the Central Committee."
lng.23.a:0 "Of course, welcome them back."
lng.23.b:0 "They can't be trusted."

lng.24.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Accepts"
lng.24.d:0 "The Kuomintang's Central Committee in [FROM.GetNameDef] has welcomed us back into their ranks. We will now support them in their efforts to rebuild the Republic as Sun Yat-sen envisioned it."
lng.24.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

lng.25.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Refuses"
lng.25.d:0 "We have no idea why, but the Kuomintang's Central Committee refused our request."
lng.25.a:0 "Idiots!"

lng.26.t:0 "Labour Dispute"
lng.26.d:0 "Guangdong province has proven itself to be one of the most progressive in terms of labour issues. Unionization has been encouraged since the early 1920s and one of the largest of these is the Union of Machinery Workers, their strike in 1921 being one of the more well-known acts in recent memory.\n\nWith increased industrialization, it appears that another labour dispute is imminent and the Machinery Workers are threatening to go on strike once more. The Provincial Government under Chen Jiongming has been presenting itself as a mediator for disputes between workers and businessmen, which has been largely successful thus far as the Governor maintained a reasonable approach to solve these issues peacefully through compromise. It is expected that Governor Chen will ensure that a compromise is reached between the Union and the factory owner, but it is plausible that the Chamber of Commerce may use their power in the government to influence the settlement to their favour."
lng.26.a:0 "The settlement slightly favours the workers."
lng.26.b:0 "The compromise slightly favours the merchants."

lng.27.t:0 "Guangzhou General Strike"
lng.27.d:0 "Our new policy in Guangdong has been poorly received among the small, but rapidly growing, working class of the great city. Led by the Machinery Workers' Union, industrial and dock workers have taken to the streets to demonstrate, refusing to work until their demands were met.\n\nUnsurprisingly, their demands ranged from improved wages and safety conditions to better representation in the provincial government where they have been recently sidelined, if not outright banned. Of course, we could negotiate with them considering how important it is to keep the factories running, but this would require a serious change in policy, which may not be politically feasible anymore. Otherwise, armed men will be required to disperse them, which will inevitably lead to bloodshed."
lng.27.a:0 "Negotiate with the strikers."
lng.27.b:0 "Send in the troops."
lng.27.c:0 "Wait it out."
lng.28.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Mobilizes"

lngcivilwar.1.t:0 "Lu Rongting Dies"
lngcivilwar.1.d:0 "Military governor of Guangxi and head of its Clique since the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, Lu Rongting peacefully passed away at the age of 77, leaving his adopted sons Lu Yuguang and Ma Ji as civilian and military governors of the province. Governor Lu had been a living symbol of the Revolution, the Republican movement, and the Warlords Era in general. Despite his early rivalry with Chen Jiongming over the control of Guangdong, the two began cooperating closely after the Qing Restoration, ensuring that Republican and anti-Qing ideals would survive. While his rule was disputed by Li Zongren, in exile in Yunnan, Lu kept Guangxi relatively stable and maintained its regional identity.\n\nWith Ma Ji securing control over the Guangxi Clique, cooperation between the two cliques of Liangguang now appears tenuous as the ambitious new warlord plots to increase his power in southern China."
lngcivilwar.1.a:0 "Worrying."

lnggxwar.1.t:0 "Li Zongren Invades!"
lnggxwar.1.d:0 "Baise, a city which controls the mountain pass connecting Guangxi with Yunnan and Vietnam, was attacked by Li Zongren, a right-wing general of the KMT, quickly overwhelming local defences. Our scouts report that the warlord has split his forces, part of it preparing to go down the Pearl River to attack Nanning, and another heading to Wuzhou to cut off Guangxi forces. Li, taking advantage of Lu Rongting's recent passing, clearly hopes to dislodge the current Guangxi Clique and take the province for himself once and for all in the name of the Kuomintang.\n\nMa Ji wants to attack Li in Baise before he has a chance to consolidate and move to Nanning, while Lu Yuguang wants to head north and keep Nanning from getting encircled. However, Lin Hu, one of our officers, suggests we instead fortify Nanning, claiming that our Guangdong ally won't allow Wuzhou to fall and that Li should be forced to dislodge them."
lnggxwar.1.a:0 "Take the fight to Li!"
lnggxwar.1.b:0 "Defend Wuzhou, we cannot be encircled!"
lnggxwar.1.c:0 "Let them come to us!"

lnggxwar.2.t:0 "Wuzhou falls; Ma struggles in Baise"
lnggxwar.2.d:0 "As expected, Wuzhou fell to Li's troops as they followed the opium trail down the Pearl River. While Li was not expecting Ma's aggressive counter-attack, his army is well-trained and they are putting a stiff fight and Ma requested reinforcements. On the other hand, Lu is worried that the enemy force in Wuzhou is exposing his flank and cutting him off from Guangdong, putting the entire province in danger if Guangdong doesn't react soon."
lnggxwar.2.a:0 "Ma Ji needs help; send reinforcements!"
lnggxwar.2.b:0 "We must secure our flank in Wuzhou first."

lnggxwar.3.t:0 "Li Zongren Defeated!"
lnggxwar.3.d:0 "After a long and bloody fight, Lu Yuguang's timely arrival forced the invading warlord to retreat. Both cliques have suffered heavy losses, but Ma Ji stands victorious, his position in Guangxi now secured from his external rival."
lnggxwar.3.a:0 "Victory at a cost."

lnggxwar.4.t:0 "Li Zongren Victorious"
lnggxwar.4.d:0 "Without help, Ma Ji was defeated in Baise, suffereing heavy losses before being mercilessly pursued. Meanwhile, Lu Yuguang was unable to dislodge Li's forces in Wuzhou and was forced to retreat back to Nanning, only to be destroyed on the way. With the Old Guangxi Clique destroy, Li Zongren is now undisputedly Governor of Guangxi, giving the right-wing of the KMT a base of operation."
lnggxwar.4.a:0 "A New Guangxi Clique."

lnggxwar.5.t:0 "Distraction!"
lnggxwar.5.d:0 "Li Zongren's attack on Wuzhou was merely a distraction meant to split Guangxi forces. With Wuzhou easily defended, Li attacked and handily defeated Ma Ji's forces in the city. With the bulk of Guangxi forces under his command, Lu Yuguang will have to retake Nanning by force, where Li has the advantage. Alternatively, he could head west to try and encircle him by taking back Baise. Of course, there is always the option to retreat to friendly Guangdong and dislodge the invaders with their help."
lnggxwar.5.a:0 "Head back to retake Nanning!"
lnggxwar.5.b:0 "Genius! Head west and cut him off!"
lnggxwar.5.c:0 "The war is lost, retreat!"

lnggxwar.6.t:0 "Lu Yuguang Repulsed"
lnggxwar.6.d:0 "Lu Yuguang's attempt to retake Nanning from Li Zongren, who had time to fortify his position, has failed. Unsurprisingly, what is left of Guangxi's forces have defected to Li's new clique, further empowering his right-KMT movement."
lnggxwar.6.a:0 "Li Zongren secures Guangxi."

lnggxwar.7.t:0 "Disintegration of the Guangxi Clique"
lnggxwar.7.d:0 "In the attempt to go up the Hongshui River, a tributary of the Pearl River, and cut off the invaders by retaking Baise, Lu Yuguang's force have desintegrated as they were quickly cut-off and destroyed near the city of Laibin. The Old Guangxi Clique is no more and its remnants have joined up with the new clique, securing Guangxi for Li Zongren's right-wing faction of the KMT."
lnggxwar.7.a:0 "Li Zongren is victorious."

lnggxwar.8.t:0 "Wuzhou Falls; Li Zongren Approaches"
lnggxwar.8.d:0 "News has reached Nanning that Wuzhou fell to a small task force under one of Li Zongren's subordinates, while Li himself is marching down towards Nanning. While Lu Yuguang and others are critical of our inaction and are nervous about being cut-off from Guangdong, Ma Ji believes that their opportunity to attack is long gone and they must further fortify the city. He also believes that Li has no choice but to attack as soon as possible or else risk intervention from Guangdong, while Lu counters that Guangdong will not act unless the road to Nanning is open."
lnggxwar.8.a:0 "Send a small force to Wuzhou."
lnggxwar.8.b:0 "Dig in."

lnggxwar.9.t:0 "Attack on Wuzhou Repulsed; Nanning Falls"
lnggxwar.9.d:0 "Not only has the small force to retake Nanning failed against an entrenched enemy, Nanning has fallen to Li Zongren's relentless assault on the city. The new clique's victory was costly, however, with significant damage to the city. Despite a low number of defections to his forces, Li Zongren has secured Guangxi for the rightist KMT."
lnggxwar.9.a:0 "A costly victory for the New Guangxi Clique"

lnggxwar.10.t:0 "Battle of Nanning"
lnggxwar.10.d:0 "Ma Ji was proven right as Li Zongren's assault on the capital of Guangxi commenced almost as soon as he arrived. Facing the full force of the Guangxi Clique, he was unable to dislodge them from their fortified positions and suffered heavy losses. When it was clear to Li that the clique had not fallen for his diversion and that he faced a disadvantageous situation, he retreated, and Ma Ji now has the chance to destroy Li's threat once and for all. However, with a portion of Li's force heading to Wuzhou as well, more cautious officers advise that they could regroup and cause trouble as bandits later, suggesting that we ask help from Guangdong to mop up Li's forces in and around Wuzhou."
lnggxwar.10.a:0 "Request help from Guangdong."
lnggxwar.10.b:0 "Pursue Li on our own."

lnggxwar.11.t:0 "Li Zongren Defeated"
lnggxwar.11.d:0 "With Guangxi forces pursuing him, Li Zongren's retreat has become more and more disorganised and turned into a rout. The invader's own whereabouts are currently unknown, but what is certain is that he is no longer a threat to Guangxi and the clique's rule is once again secure."
lnggxwar.11.a:0 "A decisive victory!"

lnggxwar.12.t:0 "Chen Mingshu's Decision"
lnggxwar.12.d:0 "Up until now, the Productive People's Party, led by Chen Mingshu and representing the majority of members of the Kuomintang in Liangguang, has been collaborating with Chen Jiongming's big-tent republican coalition. The Nationalists were happy to help develop and participate in democratic institutions in order to protect their interests and legacy after the failed Northern Expedition. This was with the long-term goal of peacefully implementing Mínquán, Sun Yat-sen's Principle of popular government. Besides, Chen's Federalists protected them from Zhili and Qing retribution.\n\nLi Zongren's seizure of Guangxi has completely changed the situation. While Chen Mingshu hardly trusts the rightist warlord despite both being members of the KMT, a golden opportunity presents itself: If he could get rid of Chen Jiongming, Liangguang would be secured for the Nationalist Party without bloodshed. He remains hesitant to betray him, however, after over a decade of protection and cooperation. Still, the Party's Central Committee has hatched a plan: Seize key buildings in Guangzhou and force Chen Jiongming, who has strong misgivings about fighting in the city, to surrender.\n\nAll Chen Mingshu has to do is give the order."
lnggxwar.12.a:0 "Li is but an untrustworthy bandit."
lnggxwar.12.b:0 "Start the operation."

lnggxwar.13.t:0 "KMT Seizes Guangzhou"
lnggxwar.13.d:0 "Early in the morning, under the cover of the general mobilization against Guangxi, armed members of the KMT began seizing key buildings around the city, including the Guangdong University and the Provincial Assembly Building. Soon, Chen Mingshu announced the formation of the Guangdong People's Government, the deposition of Chen Jiongming, and a call for peace with Guangxi province.\n\nAs expected, Chen Jiongming announced that, while he refused to recognize the new government, he refused to allow the city to suffer unnecessary bloodshed and destruction. He and his close supporters left for Hong Kong later that day, leaving the city in the hands of the Nationalist Party."
lnggxwar.13.a:0 "Bloodshed avoided."

lngcivilwar.2.t:0 "Lu Ronting's Funeral"
lngcivilwar.2.d:0 "Governor-General Chen Jiongming has been invited to former governor Lu Ronting's funeral as a guest of honour by the leadership of Guangxi. A traditional affair, Chen accepted the offer, hoping to foster greater unity between the two provinces in such trying times."
lngcivilwar.2.a:0 "A show of unity."

lngcivilwar.3.t:0 "Guarding the Body"
lngcivilwar.3.d:0 "As part of Chinese funeral traditions, Lu Rongting's body is on display at the former governor's residence, with family and close friends watching over the deceased. While Governor-General Chen and some close associates were part of the guard for the day, unknown assailants approached him, brandishing handguns. A firefight quickly ensued."
lngcivilwar.3.a:0 "The entourage is gunned down."
lngcivilwar.3.b:0 "The assailants fail and lay dead."

lngcivilwar.4.t:0 "Assassination of Chen Jiongming"
lngcivilwar.4.d:0 "Unable to react in time, Governor-General Chen Jiongming and his associates were gunned down by assassins under orders from Governor Ma Ji of Guangxi. News reached Guangdong quickly as Guangxi rapidly mobilised against them, but a question remains in the minds of the eastern province's leadership: Who will succeed Chen Jiongming as governor of Guangdong?\n\nChen Mingshu is an estranged member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang. While not opposed to the KMT in Fujian, he resents Wang Jingwei's authoritarian leadership of the party, being a more genuine believer in democracy than a number of party members.\n\nChen Lianbo is head of the Merchant Corps, the militia of the Chinese merchant class of Guangzhou. He has been an early opponent to the late Chen Jiongming's more socialistic and populist policies and wishes to protect the merchants' interests in the region first and foremost."
lngcivilwar.4.a:0 "Chen Mingshu"
lngcivilwar.4.b:0 "Chen Lianbo"

lngcivilwar.5.t:0 "Failed Attempt on Governor Chen"
lngcivilwar.5.d:0 "Reacting in time to their assailants, Chen Jiongming and his associates managed to escape unscathed. It was quickly realised that they were under Guangxi Governor Ma Ji and they quickly made their way out of Nanning. By the time they reached Guangdong, the Guangxi clique had already mobilised their armies, ready to take leadership of Liangguang by force. Upon his return, Governor-General Chen made an impromptu speech to the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, rallying them against the tyranical warlord of Guangxi and to defend their hard-earned liberties."
lngcivilwar.5.a:0 "The Dyarchy falls."

lngcivilwar.6.t:0 "The Second Guangdong-Guangxi War"
lngcivilwar.6.d:0 "The Dyarchy has fallen as the two provinces have been unable to settle their differences diplomatically. The new warlord of Guangxi is unwilling to recognise Guangdong's supremacy over Liangguang and his ambitions cannot coexist with the ideals of his eastern counterpart. Both cliques have now taken up arms; Liangguang's future will thus be settled on the battlefield."
lngcivilwar.6.a:0 "[GXC.GetLeader] will prevail!"
lngcivilwar.6.b:0 "Guangxi will take over!"

lngcivilwar.7.t:0 "Mobilisation of the Merchant Corps"
lngcivilwar.7.d:0 "The Canton Merchants' Public Safety Organization, simply known as the Merchant Corps, has mobilised their militia to help us put down the Guangxi rebels. With their interests in both provinces in danger, the merchants of Guangzhou has cast their lot on our side, giving us control over one of southern China's best troops."
lngcivilwar.7.a:0 "Their support is welcome."

lngcivilwar.8.t:0 "Mobilisation of the Rural Militia"
lngcivilwar.8.d:0 "A large part of both Guangxi and Guangdong's Militia Corps is under the command of the rural gentry. With their interests endangered by the ongoing conflict between the two provinces, the gentry has decided to fully support us and their militia are now under our command."
lngcivilwar.8.a:0 "A needed boost to our numbers."

lngcivilwar.13.t:0 "Ma Ji Secures Lianggang"
lngcivilwar.13.d:0 "The warlord of Guangxi is victorious over the Guangdong rebels. With the two Guangs secured, Ma Ji is now able to push his ambitions towards the rest of southern China and beyond."

lngcivilwar.14.t:0 "Chen Lianbo Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.14.d:0 "The head of the Merchant Corps, Chen Lianbo, has secured the General-Governorship of Liangguang after defeating the Guangxi rebels. Without a doubt, the new governor will focus on economic development and the protection of the Chinese merchants' interests in the region above all."
lngcivilwar.14.a:0 "Prosperity first."

lngcivilwar.15.t:0 "Chen Mingshu Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.15.d:0 "Chen Mingshu, head of the Productive Peoples' Party and former Kuomintang member, has defeated the Guangxi rebels and secured control of Liangguang. As Governor-General, Chen will likely align the provinces towards the KMT in Fujian and is known to support Soong Ching-ling's faction there."
lngcivilwar.15.a:0 "Another victory for the KMT!"

lngcivilwar.16.t:0 "Chen Jiongming Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.16.d:0 "Despite internal opposition and the revolt of the Guangxi Clique, Chen Jiongming has remained at the head of Liangguang. With his rule and popularity more secure than ever, he will have the ability to push further towards his ideals should the situation in the rest of the region allow it: A federal and truly democratic China."
lngcivilwar.16.a:0 "Chen will free China!"

lngcivilwar.17.t:0 "Reintegration of the Rebel Army"
lngcivilwar.17.d:0 "For the most part, the soldiers and even generals of warlord or provincial armies tended to be more concerned about defending their homes from invaders and bandits rather than matters of national importance. As such, we can reintegrate the rebel army with relative ease once their treacherous leaders are deal with. After all, they are fellow Chinese. Even if they previously served the wrong master, they can still redeem themselves or return to their homes."
lngcivilwar.17.a:0 "They will now serve a greater purpose."

lngcivilwar.18.t:0 "Old Guangxi Clique Seeks Asylum"
lngcivilwar.18.d:0 "Ma Ji and Lu Yuguang, leaders of the clique that formerly ruled Guangxi, have fled their homes after a power struggle. The two are old friends that once served under us during the war with the Kuomintang and they have asked to serve in our armed forces after being forced out of Guangxi, perhaps seeking a way to restore their rule someday."
lngcivilwar.18.a:0 "Of course, these old friends are welcome."
lngcivilwar.18.b:0 "They will have to find a new home elsewhere."

lngcivilwar.19.t:0 "Fate of Guangdong"
lngcivilwar.19.d:0 "Now that Guangdong is under our control, we must choose who will replace the previous provincial government. The top brass of the Clique is arguing for total exploitation of the developed province in order to fuel Guangxi's own development and, more important, fund an increasingly large and modern army. Of course, this is arguably rather short-sighted, and more politically-knowledgeable members of the Clique argue that we should hand over the provincial governments to the local elites so that the province isn't sucked dry."
lngcivilwar.19.a:0 "Exploit them!"
lngcivilwar.19.b:0 "We must be careful- let the locals handle it."

lngcivilwar.20.t:0 "Li Zongren Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.20.d:0 "Li Zongren, an estranged member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, managed to take over Liangguang by force. Unlike the KMT in Fujian, Li is a member of the party's right-wing, which was thought to have been purged by the left-wing along with Hu Hanmin's execution in 1925. The left-wing of the Kuomintang, until now uncontested leaders of the Nationalists, now have a very real threat to the Party's leadership."
lngcivilwar.20.a:0 "The real KMT has returned."

lngcivilwar.21.t:0 "Provincial KMT Leader Meet"
lngcivilwar.21.d:0 "With Chen Mingshu as governor of Guangdong and Li Zongren having ousted the Old Guangxi Clique, the two governors have met to discuss the future of Liangguang. The two men are essentially members of the Kuomintang, but are aligned with different factions within the party. Chen is aligned with Soong's Minquan faction while Li is de facto leader of the right-wing. While the two have differing views on how to proceed with the National Revolution, they both agree that they must form a unified government to secure the Party's position in southern China and have asked its members in the two provinces to choose their new regional leader."
lngcivilwar.21.a:0 "Chen Mingshu will fight for democracy."
lngcivilwar.21.b:0 "Unification at all costs with Li Zongren."

lngcivilwar.22.t:0 "Bai Chongxi Departs for Guangxi"
lngcivilwar.22.d:0 "Bai Chongxi left Yunnan earlier today with his men to join with his brother-in-arms, Li Zongren, in Guangxi. The latter recently became leader of the province after a power struggle with the previous clique in charge and is now in charge of the Kuomintang's right-wing in Nanning. Bai Chongxi has always been loyal to him first and foremost, and his departure was expected and unchallenged."
lngcivilwar.22.a:0 "Best of luck, I suppose."

lngcivilwar.24.t:0 "New Guangxi Clique Returns"
lngcivilwar.24.d:0 "Li Zongren's Clique was defeated in Guangxi and was forced into hiding. With Yunnan safely in the hands of the Kuomintang, they have returned, hoping to continue the fight with us and pledge their support and abilities to the National Revolutionary Army."
lngcivilwar.24.a:0 "Their revolution continues here."

lngraids.1.t:0 "Raiding German Indochina"
lngraids.1.d:0 "As the Germans are busy maintaining order in their colony, their border with us remains relatively unprotected. This makes them a prime target to raid, especially as they have poorly-defended outposts all over northern Indochina where we can easily grab supplies and equipment."
lngraids.1.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.1.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.2.t:0 "Raiding Indochina"
lngraids.2.d:0 "As the Indochinese War was a recent ordeal that they are still recovering from, Indochina remains a good target for raiding. There is bound to be equipment from the war that we can recover and salvage with little fear of resistance from exhausted Indochinese forces."
lngraids.2.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.2.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.3.t:0 "Raiding Yunnan"
lngraids.3.d:0 "The leaders of Yunnan Province have been our rivals for decades now. Their forces are formidable, but not perfect. The border between Yunnan and Guangxi is mountainous, which makes sneaking it a relatively simply affair."
lngraids.3.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.3.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.4.t:0 "Raiding Hunan"
lngraids.4.d:0 "Hunan has seen its fair share of trouble since the collapse of the League. While relatively stable, there are numerous factions vying for power and none of them are friendly to us. While they are distracted by internal affairs, we should strike."
lngraids.4.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.4.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.5.t:0 "Raiding the Nationalists"
lngraids.5.d:0 "The Nationalists have been a thorn to stability in China, which works in our favour. Their radicalism makes them inherently unstable, and we can strike them at any time as they struggle to achieve their deluded ideals."
lngraids.5.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.5.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.6.t:0 "Raiding the League"
lngraids.6.d:0 "The League is weak. Always was, always will be. The further from Nanjing, the easier it is for us to send raiders in, taking advantage of their internal dissention to acquire some more advanced hardware they themselves acquired from the German imperialists."
lngraids.6.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.6.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.7.t:0 "Raiding the International Concessions"
lngraids.7.d:0 "The imperialist Legations have been a constant symbol of humiliation for the Chinese people. Finding volunteers to send into their protected zones will be easy, and there are plenty of locals more than happy to support them against the westerners."
lngraids.7.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.7.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.8.t:0 "Raiding the German Concessions"
lngraids.8.d:0 "The blatantly-illegal consessions of the AOG are a great target for our raiders: The locals hate them, they have quality equipment for us to seize, and their defence forces are spread thin and unreliable. Raiding them is not only justified, but righteous."
lngraids.8.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.8.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.9.t:0 "Successful Bandit Attack"
lngraids.9.d:0 "One of our isolated military outposts by the border has been attacked by raiders. With chaos ruling China, we can only guess who they serve, if anyone at all. We know that they have already stolen military equipment from us, and intervening might be fruitless anyways, but it is clear that local forces will struggle to repel the raids. Regardless of whether we send troops in to help or not, we will have to secure our borders or the raids will continue."
lngraids.9.a:0 "Send reinforcements."
lngraids.9.b:0 "The local defenses will have to make due."

lngraids.10.t:0 "Raid Unsuccessful"
lngraids.10.d:0 "Our raiders returned empty-handed today. A combination of poor recon and local defenses had forced them to retreat without reaching their objective. While they have failed, they have all returned safe and sound without alerting enemy forces."
lngraids.10.a:0 "Too bad."

lngraids.11.t:0 "Failed Bandit Attack"
lngraids.11.d:0 "Bandits attacked one of our isolated military outposts by the border earlier today. Our troops, thankfully, managed to pull together and utterly destroy them despite the odds. These fools are certainly not returning anytime soon after our glorious forces dealt them such a crushing defeat. Sadly, we could not find out if they were acting under orders or simply bandits desperate for resources."

lngraids.12.t:0 "Successful Bandit Attack"
lngraids.12.d:0 "One of our isolated military outposts by the border has been attacked by a large band raiders. With chaos ruling China, we can only guess who they serve, if anyone at all.

lngraids.13.a:0 "Glory to us!"

lngraids.14.t:0 "Disastrous Raid"

lngraids.15.d:0 "Our daring raid has borne fruit. Not only did they totally crush local resistance, but our raiders left with a large amount of equipment, including a number of artillery pieces. This will definitely help us reinforce our own armies while our enemies lay humiliated."
lngraids.15.a:0 "Glory to us!"

fedsturkwp.1.t:0 "Federalists Propose Ceasefire"
fedsturkwp.1.d:0 "After the devious Governor of Xinjiang had convinced the attendants of the Shantou Conference, we thought our cause doomend. Through the willpower of our loyal divisions, we were able to finally eject the Governor from Xinjiang, and are still prepared to defend our homeland. However, the Federalists are now making overtures towards a ceasefire. This could be due to the tenuous legitimacy the final Xinjiang Governor could claim, or due to our might. Either way, we can choose to play along to this proposal or venture forward to conquest."
fedsturkwp.1.a:0 "Smart Choice"
fedsturkwp.1.b:0 "We are not afraid!"

fedsturkwp.2.t:0 "Federalists Recongizes Western Neutrality"
fedsturkwp.2.d:0 "The Federalists have officially recognized the folly of the Governor of Xinjiang, and has denouced his act of aggression against us. This pronouncement is followed by an order to cease military action against our land. Our has shown his appreciation for this peace, and the people of the Western Gate has a repsite from our armies."
fedsturkwp.2.a:0 "We are glad for this understanding"

fedsturkwp.3.t:0 "Federalists Deny Peace Offer"
fedsturkwp.3.d:0 "The Federalists have denounced our government as an insurgent force trying to overthrow Chinese soverignity in Xinjiang. The Federal President has even promised his people a return to the legitimate Chinese governorship of Xinjiang, and the end to obviously alien influence in the Province. This pronouncement is followed by a reiteration of military action against us. Our leader has, in turn, denounced the manipulative Federalist movement, which acts no different than any other Southern Chinese upstart."
fedsturkwp.3.a:0 "They must be kidding"

lngkmt.1.t:0 "Kuomintang Demands our Submission"
lngkmt.1.d:0 "Li Zongren's Kuomintang in Guangzhou has began mobilizing his forces against us. His impossible demands were formally given to us today: Our government would submit to the KMT's Central Committee, armies absorbed into the National Revolutionary Army. In exchange, we would stay as governor of our province and its army, albeit under their supervision."
lngkmt.1.a:0 "Very well..."
lngkmt.1.b:0 "Unacceptable!"

lngkmt.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Submit!"
lngkmt.2.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has refused our demands to submit to the Central Committee. We will now follow up our threats as the National Revolutionary Army marches into [FROM.GetNameDef]."
lngkmt.2.a:0 "He will pay the price."

lngkmt.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Submits!"
lngkmt.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] submitted to our pressure. His armies will be integrated into the NRA and [FROM.GetNameDef] will be under the supervision of the Central Committee."
lngkmt.3.a:0 "Unexpected, but welcome."

lngkmt.4.t:0 "Li Zongren Proclaims a New Republic"
lngkmt.4.d:0 "With the Leftists on the run and Li Zongren having taken control of the Kuomintang Central Committee, the expected proclamation arrived today: A new Republic of China is founded, with the National Revolutionary Army once more taking leadership of Sun Yat-sen's legacy and National Revolution. It will be an uphill battle, but it is the last hope for the Nationalists to claim victory from the jaws of defeat and free China."
lngkmt.4.a:0 "Long Live China!"

lngkmt.5.t:0 "Guangdong Elites Protest"
lngkmt.5.d:0 "Immediately after the proclamation came dissenting voices. The local elites of Liangguang, mainly the Gentry of the countryside and the Merchants of Guangzhou, have voiced their misgivings in a new Northern Expedition. The first one was an abject failure, with Chiang Kai-shek failing to fulfill Sun Yat-sen's dreams and the Kuomintang sapping the South of all its wealth and prosperity. The failure is quite vivid in the people's memory; the Gentry is weary of the Kuomintang's history of expropriation of demands for land reform while the Merchants keenly remember their violent purging in the Merchants' Corps Incident in 1924. The commander-in-chief is confident that the Gentry can be reassured in a timely manner, but the Merchants are far more hostile and demanding; dealing with them will likely require some sacrifices."
lngkmt.5.a:0 "They will toe the line soon enough."

lngkmt.6.t:0 "Beginning of Political Tutelage"
lngkmt.6.d:0 "Politcal Tutelage is the second stage in Sun Yat-sen's Three Stages of the National Revolution. With the country reunited, the National Revolutionary Army will begin to loosen their grip on power, while the Party will cement its own. This way, the Kuomintang will countinue to guide China towards the third and final stage and become a democratic republic. However, for this to succeed, the people must be educated so that they understand their civic duties and rights and participate in public institutions. This is to create a healthy democracy and avoid the failures of the Xinhai Revolution."
lngkmt.6.a:0 "China will be free. Eventually."

lngkmt.7.t:0 "Appoiting a Premier"
lngkmt.7.d:0 "Generalissimo Li Zongren should not be directing the National Revolution alone. As part of the reforms to create a government as outlined by Sun Yat-sen, an Executive Yuan, one of the five branches of government, will be appointed. This council will essentially act as a cabinet and its President as head of government in Western terms (as such, the President of the Executive Yuan is known as the \"Premier\" in the West).\n\nTwo choices have been presented to the Generalissimo to preside the Executive Yuan: Sun Fo, Sun Yat-sen's son, is seen as a natural candidate to reunify the factionalized Party, and Zhu Peide, one of the NRA's leaders and prominent member of the party's moderate right-wing. The first would help heal the divide within the Nationalist Party, while the second would maintain the National Revolutionary Army's political influence and the right-wing's leading role."
lngkmt.7.a:0 "Sun Fo will bring unity."
lngkmt.7.b:0 "Zhu Peide from the moderate right and the NRA."

lngkmt.8.t:0 "Preparatory Meeting of the Legislative Yuan"
lngkmt.8.d:0 "The Legislative Yuan is one of the five branches of the Republic of China's government. Currently, the body is appointed by the Chairman, Li Zongren, and acts as the country's legislature. It is assumed that when Political Tutelage ends, the body will become a proper parliament of sorts with its members elected by the people.\n\nA preparatory session opened today discussing this possibility. Debate is expected to be fierce for many members are hoping to introduce elections next year, while others do not believe that Political Tutelage should end yet and wish to postpone the decision for next year."
lngkmt.8.a:0 "Announce elections for next year!"
lngkmt.8.b:0 "The next Yuan will be appointed."

lngkmt.9.t:0 "Preparatory Meeting of the Legislative Yuan"
lngkmt.9.d:0 "The Legislative Yuan is one of the five branches of the Republic of China's government. Currently, the body is appointed by the Chairman, Li Zongren, and acts as the country's legislature. It is assumed that when Political Tutelage ends, the body will become a proper parliament of sorts with its members elected by the people.\n\nAnother preparatory session opened today discussing this possibility. Last year, the decision to elect a Legislative Yuan was delayed. A year has passed already and the debate is renewed: Should the Legislative Yuan be elected next year, or delayed once more?"
lngkmt.9.a:0 "Announce elections for next year!"
lngkmt.9.b:0 "Delay for another year."
lngkmt.9.c:0 "Delay indefinitely."

lngkmt.10.t:0 "First Election of the Legislative Yuan"
lngkmt.10.d:0 "The time has come. Political Tutelage is coming to an end and the next Legislative Yuan is to be elected by the people. While political activity outside of the Kuomintang remains limited, the Kuomintang's left-of-centre faction is campaigning fiercely for further reforms, adding a layer of democratic pluralism unseen in China for a long time."
lngkmt.10.a:0 "The Centre-Right is strenghtened."
lngkmt.10.b:0 "The Centre-Left gains a foothold."

lngkmt.11.t:0 "Legislative Yuan Election of [GetYear]"
lngkmt.11.d:0 "While the Kuomintang largely maintains a monopoly on politics, elections have been called to form a new Legislative Yuan. Reformists are unlikely to secure a victory, but may continue to strenghten their presence in the Republic's democratic institutions."
lngkmt.11.a:0 "The status quo is strenghtened."
lngkmt.11.b:0 "Reformists are strenghtened."

lngkmt.12.t:0 "Request from the Central Committee"
lngkmt.12.d:0 "The reorganized Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou has sent a simple request that we rejoin their ranks. This means putting ourselves under their command and supervision. For the good of the nation, of course."
lngkmt.12.a:0 "Of course. For the Republic!"
lngkmt.12.b:0 "This is encroaching on our autonomy!"

lngkmt.13.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Refuses our Request"
lngkmt.13.d:0 "The treacherous dogs in [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to comply! They have essentially refused to recognize the authority of the Central Committee and they shall receive the punishment befitting traitors."
lngkmt.13.a:0 "They will pay."

lngkmt.14.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Rejoins the Central Committee"
lngkmt.14.d:0 "Our friends in [FROM.GetNameDef] have, of course, accepted our request and have rejoined our ranks."
lngkmt.14.a:0 "For the Republic!"

lngkmt.15.t:0 "Integration into the Republic of China"
lngkmt.15.d:0 "With the consolidation of the Central Government under the Kuomintang, we are to be integrated firmly into the Republic."
lngkmt.15.a:0 "We will work within."

lngkmt.16.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Integrated"
lngkmt.16.d:0 "The region under the control of [FROM.GetNameDef] has been integrated into the Republic. Our government should now be unopposed there."
lngkmt.16.a:0 "Excellent!"

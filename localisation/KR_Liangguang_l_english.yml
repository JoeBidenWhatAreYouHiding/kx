GXC_secure_south_decisions_desc:0 "Liangguang is now in a position to establish hegemony over Southern China.

GXC_align_with_japan_desc:0 "With China ravaged by radicalism and warlordism, the economy is guaranteed to fall into shambles once more. Japan, however, is now the key to stability for the country. Chen Lianbo has pro-Japanese sympathies and he believes in their Panasian ideal.

GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_LEP:0 "There is irony to be noted that we are able to pressure the old leaders of the League that tried to destroy us. While we expect nothing from the so-called League Marshal, it is simply better to extend an olive branch first to show our good faith."
GXC_UPC_ultimatums_descs_ANQ:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan is definitely a man to be respected and his anti-concessionist stance is admirable. While we are unsure of his actual character, there is a chance he could be pulled over to our cause and limit bloodshed among countrymen."

The first war took place in 1920 between Lu Rongting and Chen Jiongming after the former broke with Sun Yat-sen, which the latter still supported at that point. The war was brief, resulting in Chen Jiongming's forces securing Guangdong for the KMT and Lu Rongting was unable to counter-attack.\n\nThe Liangguang Dyarchy was short-lived, as the leaders of two provinces can no longer see eye-to-eye.

### Ideas ###
 GXC_merge_eco_spirit_dummy: "the merged National Spirit"

 GXC_backwards_guangxi: "Guangxi's Struggling Economy"
 GXC_backwards_guangxi_desc: "The economy of the province of Guangxi is being sucked dry by the heavy militarisation of its governing clique, as most funds are funnelled into the provincial military. The rate of military spending has become quite unsustainable and the economy suffers as a result. Additional income sources or serious economic reforms may be required to alleviate the situation."

 GXC_AOG_leftovers: "Anti-Concessionist Wave"
 GXC_AOG_leftovers_desc: "With Black Monday and the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, the hated AOG, the association of German merchants in China, is in freefall. The German imperialists, seemingly unable to recoup their losses and left in hostile territory, are trying to flee and anti-concessionists in Guangzhou are taking full advantage of it. Rioting may break out soon, which could cause a diplomatic incident if the German presence in the city is attacked. For the time being, Chinese businessmen are happily buying our failed or failing German assets in Southern China, increasing their own influence and power in the region."

 GXC_bailing_out_peasants: "Financial Aid for Peasants"
 GXC_bailing_out_peasants_desc: "The Provincial Government has taken measures to help rural peasants cope with the ongoing economic crisis."

 GXC_bailing_out_merchants: "Bailing out Merchants"
 GXC_bailing_out_merchants_desc: "The Provincial Government has taken measures to bail out bankrupted merchants and help them recover from the global economic downturn."

 GXC_guangxi_militarism: "Guangxi Militarism"
 GXC_guangxi_militarism_desc: "Militarism has been prominent in Guangxi for centuries and the military prowess of its people are well-known throughout China. It is only natural that we are tapping into this powerful situation in order to advance our ambitions."

 GXC_militia_corps_idea: "Militia Corps"
 GXC_militia_corps_idea_desc: "The term Militia Corps refers to units of militia levied from small towns and villages to serve as anti-bandit forces or, sometimes, as a reserve force. These are typically led and equipped by the local gentry and notable. This means that many people in rural areas have some kind of military experience, expanding our pool of potential recruits."

 GXC_militarised_guangxi: "Militarised Guangxi"
 GXC_militarised_guangxi_desc: "Guangxi Province has been thoroughly militarised in order to serve the ambitions of the ruling clique. The province only exists to support the provincial forces, as if the army was the state itself."

 GXC_roar_of_wolftroops: "Roar of the Wolf Troops"
 GXC_roar_of_wolftroops_desc: "The Lang Bing, or Wolf Troops, were a special military unit of the Ming Dynasty comprised of elite troops from the southern provinces, especially Guangxi. They were ferocious and brutal, which was perfect for its intended role of suppressing dissent and foreign raiders. Their legacy lives on along with Guangxi's fearsome reputation of having the best soldiery in China, and the people have embraced that identity."

 GXC_mountaineer_training: "Mountaineer Training"
 GXC_mountaineer_training_desc: "The people of southern China are familiar with its mountains. Naturally, this means that many of our soldiers are already used to the intricacies and dangers of mountain warfare, making us able to create a strong force of mountaineers to defend our homeland."

 GXC_factionalism: "Increased Factionalism"
 GXC_factionalism_desc: "The collapse of the League of Eight Provinces has created a power vacuum in the region. While Liangguang is being mostly spared from the armed conflict to succeed the League, many factions within the region have taken this as a signal to push their agenda while ambitious men look for any potential openings towards power."

 GXC_divided_military: "Divided Military"
 GXC_divided_military_desc: "The provincial armies of Guangdong and Guangxi have been independent of each other since the Xinhai Revolution with few exceptions until the Kuomintang's failed revolt. The two armies have yet to form a single unified command structure and this will greatly affect their general performance until this is rectified."

 GXC_reforming_guangxi: "Financial Reform in Guangxi"
 GXC_reforming_guangxi_desc: "The government has finally taken steps to rectify the abysmal economic situation in Guangxi."

 GXC_warlord_economy: "Warlordist Economy"
 GXC_warlord_economy_desc: "The economy has only one use: To supply and support the governor's forces. The government is quite unscrupulous about adding revenue to support military spending and this will likely have serious long-term socio-economic consequences as the number of opium and gambling addicts continue to rise, but the army needs money and it needs it now."

 GXC_modernising_guangxi: "Modernising Guangxi"
 GXC_modernising_guangxi_desc: "The government has taken further steps to rectify the abysmal economic situation in Guangxi, which will hopefully lead to a modern economy in the future."

 GXC_guangxi_four_guangxi_peeps: "Guangxi Ruled by Guangxi People"
 GXC_guangxi_four_guangxi_peeps_desc: "\"Guangxi Ruled by Guangxi People\" is an adaption of Chen Jiongming's slogan \"Guangdong for Guangdong People\". The idea is to create democratic institutions and help develop local democracy among the people of Guangxi and, in the end, modernise the province."

 GXC_suppressing_bandits: "Suppressing Bandits"
 GXC_suppressing_bandits_desc: "Banditry is rampant in Guangxi. Suppressing it will be a long and tough process, but it must be done in order to bring back order and safety to the province. Any modernisation attempt is bound to fail if those basic needs of the populace are not fulfilled."

 GXC_warlord_economy_idea: "Warlord Economy"
 GXC_warlord_economy_idea_desc: "The money must flow somehow and whether it be by force or by coercion, we will make Liangguang into a province suitable for our military needs."

 GXC_unfinished_reforms: "Unfinished Reforms"
 GXC_unfinished_reforms_desc: "Despite initial optimism, the Three Year Plan has suddenly halted. While its initial stabilisation and reconstruction were implemented, it is far from its full potential."

 GXC_aviation_bureau: "Liangguang Aviation Bureau"
 GXC_aviation_bureau_desc: "The two provinces have a small but burgeoning aviation industry. The potential of air power is great, especially in China where few factions have access to it, and the Aviation Bureau has been created in order to train new pilots, mechanics, and help expand the industry to our advantage."

 GXC_officer_vanguards_idea: "Officer Vanguards"
 GXC_officer_vanguards_idea_desc: "China has almost unlimited manpower, but numbers alone does not necessarily win wars as very few soldiers are educated and even less have military experience. Forming units entirely out of officers, whom have both education and experience, will make sure that we have military units with far superior capabilities over huge armies of conscripts."

 GXC_professional_officers: "Professional Officers"
 GXC_professional_officers_desc: "China has almost unlimited manpower, but officers are needed to lead these soldiers, usually uneducated peasants conscripted from small towns and villages. We must make sure that our officers are well-trained and educated so that they can lead these men properly instead of wasting them."

 GXC_legacy_of_the_army_of_steel_idea: "Legacy of the Army of Steel"
 GXC_legacy_of_the_army_of_steel_idea_desc: "The Army of Steel is the nickname of the Kuomintang's Seventh Army during the Northern Expedition. These men, mostly from Guangxi, proved themselves as the most capable soldiers of the south, scoring numerous victories, even while facing the Jade Marshal himself. Despite the KMT's revolution failing, the legacy of the Steel Army lives on."

While these hopes were quickly dashed by the Qing Restoration, they remain a significant force, albeit banned in Qing/Zhili-controlled lands for their explicit republicanism.

While the League attracted fairly little attention, it became Chen's formal coalition in the Guangdong Provincial Assembly. The league is wide and unwieldy, containing federalists of all colours, Kuomintang remnants, business and gentry interests, and even syndicalists.

Chen Lianbo, its leader from the beginning, fled to Hong Kong, only returning after the failed Northern Expedition.

 GXC_kmt_pac_long: "Zhōngguó Guómíndang - Línshí Xíngdòng Wěiyuánhuì\n§LNationalist Party of China - Provisional Action Committee§!\n\n§gThe Provisional Action Committee was formed during the League War by those who supported Song Qingling in the MinGan Provisional Government and distrusted the authoritarian nature of the returned Central Committee led by Wang Jingwei. Believing in the notion of achieving total socialism by the workers and the peasantry, the PAC draws its name from its desire for the Kuomintang to take action as a revolutionary vanguard with the masses gaining revolutionary consciousness and taking action as well.\n\nThe main ideological facets of the PAC is a total social revolution through democratic land reform to reward the land to those who till it, the installation of local self-governments as a result, and the necessity for China to adopt a method of \"National Capitalism\" to transition China from a feudal society into a socialist one. While some members of PAC view the Third Internationale's extension into China as a potential threat to the native revolution practised in China, the PAC nonetheless has shown a willingness to work with members of the orthodox faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party as well as an equally beneficial relationship with the World Society. As one of the two major political cliques in the Kuomintang, the PAC seeks to enlighten the masses of China and transform the Chinese proletariat into a force of revolutionary change to entirely defeat the warlords, expel the imperialists, and fulfil the dream of Sun Yat-sen. With the Kuomintang’s right wing reestablishing itself as the dominant force in the party, the PAC has emerged as the main leftist opposition to the Generalissimo in the Central Committee.§!"

Upon the return of the Kuomintang's right wing and the unification of China under the KMT, they have returned as a major conservative political faction of the Kuomintang.

The RCA, led primarily by Chen Gongbo, but including the closest friends and followers of Wang Jingwei - believes that if the revolution is to be saved, it must be reorganised in the same spirit as 1924. The Kuomintang, in their eyes, must be purged of its excess democratic and reactionary forces; only then will China achieve her national revolution.\n\nOnce a secret faction amongst the Chinese expatriate community in Europe, with the return of the Central Committee, the RCA has emerged as one of the Kuomintang's two major political parties. They adhere to a model of strict leadership (seeing the Kuomintang as the vanguard of the socialist revolution) and a party for the peasantry, workers, and petite bourgeoisie. They hold warm and cordial ties with the Third Internationale, and many RCA members also hold relations with the radical wing of the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Nonetheless, it is a movement that sees the Chinese Nationalist cause as not just one for China but also one for the entirety of Asia. The RCA runs on a platform that China is the socialist vanguard, spreading the revolution far and wide and liberating the oppressed peoples of Asia from the chains of imperialism. The RCA consists of two wings - the radical wing led by Chen Gongbo and a moderate wing led by Gu Mengyu - with their views differing over issues such as the nature of class struggle in China or land reform.\n\n Various setbacks and unforeseen circumstances have seen the RCA lose its once dominant position in the Central Committee to formerly marginalised right wing elements within the party. RCA members who have joined the new rightist dominated Central Committee have begrudgingly allied with PAC members to form a leftist opposition to the Generalissimo.§!"

It is the union of two provinces, Guangxi in the west and Guangdong in the east, and their governemnts remain separate and largely independent of each other. This union, so far, remains an informal one, and steps should be made to formalise it under the recreated position of Governor-General of Liangguang."

GXC_Guangxi_Construction_Plan_desc:0 "Out of the two provinces consisting Liangguang, Guangxi is the one clearly lagging behind in economic development.

GXC_Warlordist_Economy_desc:0 "Many provincial military governments in China have lackluster economies due to the very nature of their regimes, with every bit of wealth funnelled into the army.

GXC_Opium_Smuggling_desc:0 "It is no secret that Guangxi, like many provinces, have a serious opium problem. On the other hand, a major opium trade route courses through the province and the Clique profits from it greatly.

GXC_Economic_Modernization_desc:0 "Guangxi cannot continue to depend on the awful opium trade any longer. It is not only an addiction for many Chinese, but also for the provincial administration in order to fund its operations.

GXC_Develop_Terrace_Field_desc:0 "Terrace fields are certainly nothing new in Southern China. Guangxi especially, where its rough terrain makes it an outright necessity in many parts of the province. Still, they are not easy technical feats and require significant investment before farmers can work them. After all, Guangxi is still very agrarian and there is little reason to believe that this will change in the near future."

GXC_three_year_plan: "The Three Year Administrative Plan"
GXC_three_year_plan_desc: "Our time is limited if we are to indeed unite the country or maintain our province's autonomy.

GXC_grand_construction_scheme_desc: "As Guangdong remains the more industrial part of Liangguang, we must take it upon ourselves as part of the National Revolution to industrialise and develop Guangxi as well. In order to rapidly develop our province with what meagre industry we have, we will encourage construction efforts across the province to develop and suit our needs."

GXC_rapid_industrialisation: "Rapid Industrialisation"
GXC_rapid_industrialisation_desc: "More, more, and more. Our province groans under the weariness of our large military but in order to fulfil our arms production and quotas, we must challenge our industry to grow even more.

GXC_We_Are_Bandits_desc:0 "Guangxi and banditry have a long and deep history together. Why should this tradition be broken? These Guangxi bandits remain known as some of the greatest warriors in China. We should embrace this identity, not destroy it, for it is what we truly are."

GXC_liquidate_assets: "Liquidate Profitable Assets"
GXC_liquidate_assets_desc: "Unlike the other major cliques in China, the region of Guangdong remains quite profitable as a result of foreign trade and its proximity to the sea and to Hong Kong. The rich of this province however are unwilling to share their wealth with us nor are they willing to cooperate with our regime. As such, let us take efforts to seize their property and wealth so that they may serve our armies."

GXC_resource_industry: "Liangguang's Resources"
GXC_resource_industry_desc: "The more we mine into Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hainan Island - the more we realise that there are plentiful natural resources in Guangdong.

GXC_autarky: "Pursue Autarky"
GXC_autarky_desc: "Liangguang's resources should only be utilised by Liangguang alone. Neither the Central Government nor the foreigners are worthy of our hard work and toil.

GXC_twin_model_provinces: "Twin Model Provinces"
GXC_twin_model_provinces_desc: "Under its former warlord Chen Jiongming, the province of Guangdong was nicknamed "The Model Province", due to Chen's reforms and his economic development of the province. We have taken it upon ourself to build up both Guangdong and Guangxi into commendable provinces, as such it is only fitting that are provinces are now regarded as "Twin Model Provinces" - a model for all of China to follow."

GXC_second_arsenal_desc:0 "The Paijang Artillery Factory, also known as the Second Guangdong Arsenal, was built in 1933 with help from Siemmsen & Co. and the AOG.

GXC_specialized_artillery:0 "Specialized AA/AT Guns"
GXC_specialized_artillery_desc:0 "While air and armoured power remains fairly limited in China, their presence is steadily growing and we must adopt countermeasures to deal with them effectively.

GXC_Liangguang_Aviation_Bureau:0 "Liangguang Aviation Bureau"
GXC_Liangguang_Aviation_Bureau_desc:0 "Both provinces have a tiny aviation industry spurred by the demands of the provincial armies and their leaders. While this industry may be insignificant to foreign eyes, it is an incredible boon compared to most Chinese provincial governments. The two provinces should pool their resources and expertise together to maintain the significant advantage military aviation brings to the modern battlefield."

GXC_Liangguang_Aviation_School_desc:0 "In order to create any kind of air force, officers and men must be trained and educated. An aviation school to train pilots and crews would help us create the basic infrastructure and develop our fledging air fleet."

GXC_rejuvenation_type_aircraft:0 "Rejuvenation-type Fighters"
GXC_rejuvenation_type_aircraft_desc:0 "The aircraft factories in Liuzhou and Shaoguan have begun developing their own aircraft design. The Guangxi Type 3, a biplane of mixed construction, is one of the first successful fighters made in China, while Shaoguan is working on a modern monoplane they named \"Rejuvenation-type\". They could become the backbone of our air force and give us an immeasurable advantage over our foes."

GXC_northern_doctrine:0 "Northern Doctrine: Firepower"
GXC_northern_doctrine_desc:0 "The Chinese armies in the north have developed their own doctrine based on firepower from their experiences fighting in the North China Plain. Considering we are likely to be fighting the Northerners on their own turf, it would be wise to adopt their ideas and experiences for our own forces as we continue to rebuilt and reform our armies."

GXC_southern_doctrine:0 "Southern Doctrine: Mobility"
GXC_southern_doctrine_desc:0 "The fighting in Southern China since the Xinhai Revolution has mainly revolved around highly mobile infantry forces focusing on mobility and maintaining a manpower advantage. Since we are certainly going to be defending ourselves from attackers, we should continue to adapt from our own lessons fighting in the South, where our troops already fight best."

GXC_reopen_whampoa:0 "Professional Officer Corps"
GXC_reopen_whampoa_desc:0 "Professionalism among the officers of Chinese armies is hard to come by since many of them are former bandits. However, Liangguang has seen a steadily increasing literacy rate, which gives us an advantage when recruiting and training new officers. We must strive for professionalization so that our officers can be the true defenders of the Republic and not an army trained from the \"Green School\"."

GXC_militia_integration:0 "Militia Integration"
GXC_militia_integration_desc:0 "Armies in Southern China since the creation of the Qing New Armies in the late 19th century have essentially been large militia forces. Integrating them into our army structure will ensure that we have access to motivated and experienced manpower, eager to defend their homes from warlords and bandits."

GXC_minjun_reforms:0 "Minjun Reforms"
GXC_minjun_reforms_desc:0 "Minjun, or citizen/popular armies, are the name used to denote volunteer soldiers in Southern Armies. They have a mixed reputation to say the least, as the Kuomintang derided them as bandits in their propaganda. We must reform this force, as citizen-soldiers will be the backbone of an effective army that will defend the republic just as they did in the United States and Britain."

GXC_civilwar_lessons:0 "Lessons of the Yue-Gui Wars"
GXC_civilwar_lessons_desc:0 "The Yue-Gui Wars, shorthand for the Guangdong-Guangxi Wars, refer to a number of conflicts between Guangdong and Guangxi province since the Xinhai Revolution. Our forces still have much to learn when it comes to modern warfare, and the most recent war will be examined and studied in order to improve our armies, for the wars in China appear to have no end in sight."

GXC_modern_army_structure:0 "Modernize Army Structure"
GXC_modern_army_structure_desc:0 "Chinese armies differ significantly from modern Western armies despite decades of attempting to emulate them. Unsurprisingly, a modern army structure is a necessity to properly conduct wars, and the Chief of Staff has presented a new system to organize infantry divisions."

GXC_improved_logistics:0 "Improved Logistics"

GXC_mountain_warfare_desc:0 "Southern China has no shortages of rough terrain with the Nanling Mountains covering the northern region of Liangguang.

GXC_modern_engineers:0 "Permanent Engineer Corps"
GXC_modern_engineers_desc:0 "The Pearl River is proving to be a great obstacle to large unit movements within Liangguang. A professional corps of engineers inspired by their western equivalents will help us surmount challenges presented by river crossings during battle, as there will be no shortage of those in the future."

GXC_proper_recon:0 "Reconnaissance Training"
GXC_proper_recon_desc:0 "Recon and intelligence has always been a staple of a competent army. Modern war has given us new tools and challenges to accomplish this necessary task, which will ensure that our troops know what is in front of them and give our officers the ability to plan and react properly to challenges."

GXC_modern_forts:0 "Fortifications Study"
GXC_modern_forts_desc:0 "It seems inevitable that war will be coming to us at some point as we are surrounded by hostile rivals. Fortifications in modern war have a mixed reputation, but the proper and reasonable use of static fortifications can help deter enemies from certain areas, funnel them into certain chokepoints, or create difficult obstacles on strategic points."

GXC_federal_army:0 "Recreate the Guofangjun"
GXC_federal_army_desc:0 "The Guofangjun, or National Defense Army, was first formed by Chen Jiongming in 1920.

GXC_fourth_army:0 "The Iron Army's Legacy"
GXC_fourth_army_desc:0 "The Iron Army is the nickname of the 4th Army of the Republic of China. These men from Guangdong formed the core of the KMT's forces during the Northern Expedition, quickly becoming known as one of its most capable units. As this army was essentially created from Chen Jiongming's Guangdong Army, their legacy is maintained to this day as a highly mobile and competent army despite the Expedition's failure."

GXC_Officer_Vanguards:0 "Officer Vanguards"
GXC_Officer_Vanguards_desc:0 "Officer Vanguards are units consisting purely of veteran NCOs and officers to serve as a vanguard to the army. Instead of spreading our officers thin to lead poorly-trained and inexperienced units, we can instead concentrate them in their own units, where their experience and skill will make them useful in daring assaults."

GXC_Professional_Officer_Corps:0 "Professional Officer Corps"
GXC_Professional_Officer_Corps_desc:0 "Professionalising the officer corps will ensure that our divisions are led by trained and talented officers. As we are likely to field a large army with limited time and resources to train and equip them, poor leadership would lead to complete disasters, but good leadership can make up for these shortcomings."

 GXC_russian_advisors: "Invite the Russian Military Expedition"
 GXC_russian_advisors_desc: "Many in Russia sympathise with the Kuomintang in regards to our shared hatred for the German Empire and for our own revolutionary struggle to revive China.

GXC_liangguang_NRA_desc:0 "Comrades, do not forget your brothers, your xiongdi, who fought bravely and with honour against Chen Jiongming's army at the Battle of Mianhu.

GXC_Lu_Rontings_Legacy_desc:0 "Lu Rongting was a brilliant man. Not only in military matters, but in personal relations and his eye for talent unmatched. Under him, the Guangxi Clique developed an open-minded and pluralist group that brought people in for their skill regardless of their background, as demonstrated by Lu's adopted sons and successors, a Hui Muslim and a Vietnamese."

GXC_Merchant_Corp_Dominance:0 "Merchant Corps Dominance"
GXC_Merchant_Corp_Dominance_desc:0 "The Guangzhou Merchant Corps, the Chamber of Commerce's own defence force, has become one of the dominant forces in Chen Lianbo's Liangguang. Expectedly, they have become a favoured institution and their influence has grown significantly."

GXC_Strengthen_Trade_Protection:0 "Strengthen Trade Protection"
GXC_Strengthen_Trade_Protection_desc:0 "The Chamber of Commerce insists on reviewing many legislation enacted by Chen Jiongming's government.

GXC_End_Labor_Movement:0 "Suppress the Labour Movement"
GXC_End_Labor_Movement_desc:0 "The labour movement in Guangdong has grown along with industrialisation, protected by Chen Jiongming's socialist policies. This cannot go on, as the labour movement continue to threaten the economic stability and prosperity of the province. After all, can these puppets of the Western Syndicalist powers be trusted in the first place?"

GXC_Philantropy:0 "Philantropy"
GXC_Philantropy_desc:0 "Chen Lianbo is a philanthropist, which has made him beloved with the people.

Besides, it's very good PR."

GXC_Merchants_Fight_Bandits:0 "Crush Guangxi Bandits"
GXC_Merchants_Fight_Bandits_desc:0 "Banditry in Guangxi has been a thorn for the region's development. Their very presence is enough to hamper economic growth, something the Chamber of Commerce can no longer tolerate, and the Merchant Corps will ensure that trade is protected in the region."

GXC_Chinese_Washington:0 "The Chinese Washington"
GXC_Chinese_Washington_desc:0 "During the Merchant Corps Uprising, a Western commentator in Hong Kong described Chen Lianbo as the \"Chinese Washington\".

GXC_Southern_Reconstruction_Plan_desc:0 "During the 1920s, Chen Jiongming wrote an ambitious Reconstruction Plan for China, hoping to bridge the gap between the warring factions and reunite the country, and this was adopted by several other provincial governors at the time.

GXC_Civilian_Guangxi:0 "Restore Civilian Control in Guangxi"
GXC_Civilian_Guangxi_desc:0 "For too long, Guangxi has been controlled by power-hungry, irresponsible militarists that have sapped to province of all its wealth and happiness.

GXC_Feds_Supress_Bandits:0 "End Banditry in Guangxi"
GXC_Feds_Supress_Bandits_desc:0 "Banditry has been plaguing Guangxi since the Xinhai Revolution.

GXC_Military_Nationalization:0 "Military Nationalisation"

GXC_three-stage_revolution_desc:0 "Sun Yat-sen, our Party's founder, envisioned that the National Revolution would happen in three stages after the failure of the first Republic.

To this end, martial law must be enforced while the Party keeps tight control over institutions."

 GXC_provinical_unrest_desc: "Although the Kuomintang has long had a major presence in Liangguang, particularly in their old bases in Guangdong, there are many who continue to hold loyalty to the treacherous federalists, corrupt merchants or even the wretched warlords.

The Army must be reformed, its legacy enshrined as it once again carries the torch of National Revolution."

GXC_dang_guo:0 "Dang Guo"
GXC_dang_guo_desc:0 "\"Yi Dang Zhi Guo\", meaning \"using the party to run the state\", was the cornerstone of the first two stages of Sun Yat-sen's National Revolution where the Nationalist Party would rule as a dictatorship until the Revolution comes to a successful conclusion."

GXC_People_Production_Party_Plan_desc:0 "The Productive People's Party's agenda does not differ significantly from the Kuomintang's, nor does it oppose Sun Yat-sen's vision.

GXC_renovate_whampoa_desc:0 "The Kuomintang Military Academy was first founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1924 in Whampoa (Huangpu) near Guangzhou.

GXC_claim_leadership:0 "Claim Nationalist Leadership"
GXC_claim_leadership_desc:0 "The Leftists in Fujian have diverged further and further from Sun Yat-sen's teachings, poisoning it with imperialist ideals, such as Syndicalism, incompatible with China.

GXC_kmt_congress_desc: "Having finally consolidated our rule across the nation, we must now gather leading Kuomintang members to the official formation of a new republic under the White Sun. Together they shall lay the groundwork for the next stage in our revolution, integrating all provinces in China to the organs of our government. Although many brave comrades have fallen along the way, China has at last been saved."

GXC_martial_law: "Extend the Period of Tutelage"
 GXC_martial_law_desc: "As stated in Article 28-31, the ideas of political tutelage must be implemented during the National Reconstruction in accordance with the philosophy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

 GXC_academia_sinica: "Academia Sinica"
 GXC_academia_sinica_desc: "As part of the national reconstruction model expressed by the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Academia Sinica is the Republic's attempt to champion scholarly research and higher education ideals. Classes in the academy will offer training and study in the disciplines of a wide range of topics, including biology, mathematics, the humanities, agriculture, and more."

 GXC_national_monopoly: "Create Nationalised Monopolies"
 GXC_national_monopoly_desc: "China's status as a semi-colonial society harkens to the idea that China is not economically self-sufficient to be a truly free nation. As part of our National Reconstruction efforts and in accordance with the principles of the Sanminzhuyi, we will take efforts to nationalise and control all major state projects, such as the Railways, to develop a genuinely self-sufficient economy."

 GXC_rebuild_national_arsenals: "Rebuild the National Arsenals"
 GXC_rebuild_national_arsenals_desc: "Across the country, arsenals lay abandoned or misused from their times serving the private armies or machinations of the various provincial warlords.

 GXC_extend_education: "Reach out to the Mass Movement"
 GXC_extend_education_desc: "One of the key principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Sanminzhuyi are the ideals of Minzu and Minsheng. While Minsheng, in general, has been pervaded by the left wing of the party, our interpretation still favours a mass-movement-like approach to reach out to the country's Chinese workers and peasantry and uplift them from warlordism. However, we will not solely focus on them, but encourage the notion that the KMT is a party for the masses, including the bourgeoisie."

 GXC_state_capitalism: "Adopt National Capitalism"
 GXC_state_capitalism_desc: "In his search for China's economic recovery and rebirth, Dr. Sun Yat-sen turned away from both the practices of western capitalism and Marxism, believing that there could be another way to resolve the issue of capitalism while modernising the country. Following his principles, the state will play a role in the economic planning and structuring of the country by creating coastal enclaves where foreign trade and capital can help the economy of China develop rapidly."

 GXC_economic_stabilisation: "National Reconstruction Commission"

The Three Principles shall be the basis of all schooling throughout the nation."

 GXC_new_life_movement: "Awaken the New Life Movement"
 GXC_new_life_movement_desc: "While we have completed the military phase of the revolution, there are many within the Kuomintang's right-wing that view that the government's duty to the welfare of the people is not yet complete. As corruption, pervasiveness, and hedonism permeate every aspect of Chinese society, it is up to the State to instruct and guide the nation back to their orderly roots of Confucianism and legalism to revive the ethics of the Old China that we have since lost."

 GXC_cult_of_personality: "The Cult of the Generalissimo"
 GXC_cult_of_personality_desc: "From the leader of bandits to the Generalissimo of the National Revolutionary Army, Li Zongren has become a household name throughout the country as the man who unified China under the banner of Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang.

 GXC_constitution: "Ratification of the Constitution"
 GXC_constitution_desc: "Per the instructions at the end of the First National Congress, the time has come to ratify a new Constitution and to end the period of political tutelage.

Let us study the tactics of the wars of unification to prepare the NRA for its future struggles."

 GXC_firepower: "Shock and Awe"
 GXC_firepower_desc: "Artillery has long been a favourite of warlord armies due to their range and ease of use, although poor coordination and equipment often led to more failures than successes. Let us study western artillery tactics and copy them, such as "creeping barrages" to develop our explosive breakthrough doctrines."

 GXC_kmt_tanks: "The New Method of War"
 GXC_kmt_tanks_desc: "During the wars of unification, very few Chinese warlord cliques or governments owned tanks - with nearly all armoured vehicles being foreign imports. As China is now unified and the industrial heartland of the country belongs to us, let us develop our own tank and armour programme. Our wars in the future will no longer be fought with the dadao and the rifle but rather by the devastating breakthrough potential of armoured units."

 GXC_kmt_central_military_academy: "Establish the Central Military Academy"
 GXC_kmt_central_military_academy_desc: "With the completion of Dr. Sun's vision, there no longer exists a need to host the Whampoa Military Academy in Guangzhou.

This will help our central command structure and encourage recruits from all across the country to learn from the best officers China has to offer."

 GXC_integrate_the_warlords: "Integrate the Warlords"
 GXC_integrate_the_warlords_desc: "Despite the unification of the country, there exists still plenty of warlord generals and armies who have yet to lay down their arms to the central government. Let us offer amnesty to these generals so that their troops may now service the new Republic of China - and ensure that the armies of this country remain under the control of the Party."

 GXC_kmt_cic: "Chinese Industrial Cooperatives"
 GXC_kmt_cic_desc: "As a result of the chaos of the wars of unification and resistance, thousands of Chinese men and women find themselves either refugees or out of work. In order to make up for China's lost industrial capacity, we will organise industrial cooperatives for workers to receive voting shares and to contribute to China's growing arms industries. Not only will this encourage the masses' support of the Party but it will also help us direct much needed efforts towards reviving our arms industries."

 GXC_kmt_nra: "The Army of the Republic"
 GXC_kmt_nra_desc: "Despite the NRA's problems after the unification, we have succeeded in our reforms to modernise and equip the NRA for future conflicts. Every day, we receive new and eager recruits ready to be taught by battle-hardened veterans of the NRA. As the true army of the Chinese Republic, our armed forces shall be a testament to the success of Chinese modernisation for generations to come.

 GXC_kmt_new_fighters: "Develop Our Own Fighters"
 GXC_kmt_new_fighters_desc: "With the creation of our own native air industries, let us pursue the production of our own domestic fighters such as the Chu (AFAMF) XP-0. This monoplane will be able to serve dual purposes as both a fighter and a dive bomber in the skies."

 GXC_kmt_medium_bomber: "Terror from the Skies"
 GXC_kmt_medium_bomber_desc: "As the conflicts around the world showed us, modern wars are also won by intense bombing campaigns to target enemy industrial complexes and military apparatuses. Let us encourage our pilots and air designers to study European bomber designs so that we can adopt a similar air doctrine focused on firepower from above."

 GXC_kmt_cas: "Close-Air Support Integration"
 GXC_kmt_cas_desc: "We have learned from observing the modern European conduct of war from countries such as the German Empire and the Union of Britain, that close-air support is essential to the mobility of the modern battlefield. Let us seek to emulate their progress by studying and purchasing foreign bombers for the purposes of advancing our own air force."

 GXC_naval_bombers: "Naval Targeting Aerial Programme"
 GXC_naval_bombers_desc: "As the War of Resistance taught us, one of China's greatest weaknesses are that it can fall victim to an outright superior naval power such as the Empire of Japan or the German Empire.

 GXC_legacy_of_beiyang_fleet_desc: "As a result of the unification wars, some of China's best admirals and naval officers now find themselves out of work since the National Unification. We shall offer them full government amnesty so that these naval officers can train and lead the next generation of Chinese sailors on the high seas as part of China's new revolutionary navy."

 GXC_kmt_destroyers: "Destroyer Programme"
 GXC_kmt_destroyers_desc: ""Any modern Navy requires Destroyer vessels to make up its lighter support. Thus, a programme to fund and build these ships is highly supported by the new Republican Navy, and will be highly beneficial to our overall naval building efforts."

 GXC_kmt_submarines: "Death from the Depths"
 GXC_kmt_submarines_desc: "The next step in building our Navy are submarines. Many modern navies use these ships to attack convoys and fleets across the many oceans, which would be wonderful for disrupting our many enemies in the Pacific, as well as protect our shores from would-be invaders. This would be a wonderful step to a full modern Navy."

 GXC_cruisers: "Chinese Cruiser Modernisation Scheme"

lng.1.t:0 "The Situation in Liangguang"
lng.1.d:0 "With the League of Eight Provinces falling into open warfare to secure Nanjing, Chen Jiongming, the Governor of Guangdong, announced the immediate secession of the province from the League. Denouncing the League as corrupt and unable to protect the rights and welfare of the people, he was followed suit by Governor Lu Rongting of Guangxi in the west. Accordingly, the provincial assemblies of Guangdong and Guangxi held a joint meeting in Guangzhou, electing Chen Jiongming as Extraordinary Governor-General of Liangguang.\n\nWhile the \"Two Guangs\" are united in defence against bandits, the ambition of Warlords from the disintegrating League, this new union of provinces is already proving to be struggling. The leaders of Guangdong and Guangxi are only united by pragmatism, the two having widely different aims for the region, let alone China as a whole. Lu Rongting leads a highly militarized province, while Chen leads a varied republican coalition in one of the few functioning democracies in all of China.\n\nLiangguang may avoid the bloodshed of the collapse of the League, but it will not avoid the consequences of Beijing's failure to keep China vaguely united."

lng.101.t:0 "Briefly Introducing Liangguang"
lng.101.d:0 "Liangguang, or \"Two Guangs\", is a geographical term representing the provinces of Guangxi in the west and Guangdong in the east. The Viceroyalty of Liangguang was first created during the Ming Dynasty, but would be dissolved and reformed numerous times until its final dissolution in 1911. Its official name was the lengthy \"Governor-General, Commander and Quartermaster, Supervisor of Waterways, and Inspector-General of the Two Expanses (Guangs) and Surrounding Areas\".\n\nGuangdong province is one of the most wealthy and developed parts of China, with Guangzhou rivaling Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. However, its recent history is marred with warfare and destruction, with the province losing Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhouwan to Western imperialists in the 19th century, while the Xinhai Revolution eventually brought further ruin by numerous wars between warlords and the turbulent rule of the Kuomintang. Since the failure of the Northern Expedition in 1926, the province has been governed Chen Jiongming and has seen a remarkable recovery and growth, developing a young provincial democracy in the process.\n\nGuangxi, meanwhile, has been ruled by Lu Rongting, who is seen as the quintessential warlord. The province has been highly militarized and its soldiers are well-known across China to be some of the best. However, this high level of militarization has been costly, and the wealthier Guangdong has been essentially keeping the Guangxi Army afloat, creating an interdependent relationship between the two provinces as Guangxi troops often supplement the smaller Guangdong Army."
lng.101.a:0 "Governor Chen will see us through."
lng.101.b:0 "What about all these factions?"

lng.102.t:0 "Factionalism in Liangguang"
lng.102.d:0 "While Chen Jiongming currently leads a wide coalition of republicans, the Grand Republican League, it contains numerous factions outside of his own political party.\n\nThe Public Interest Party, or Zhigongdang, was founded in 1925 by Chen Jiongming and his ally, Tang Jiyao. Its ideology can be compared to western social-democracy, wanting to improve civil and workers' rights throughout China. Mainly, however, it is the most important Federalist party in the country, calling for the Central government to be reorganized as a federal republic and multiparty democracy.\n\nThe Productive People's Party, led by Chen Mingshu, is essentially a front-organization for the moderate-left Kuomintang in Guangdong. While also social-democratic like the Federalists, they differ as the PPP's ideology and philosophy is based on Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and his teachings. Their major obstacle in working closer with the Federalists is the bad history between the two parties' founders, who violently split before the Northern Expedition.\n\nWhile not a political party, the Merchants' Public Safety Organization, the paramilitary organization of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, is highly influential. Led by Chen Lianbo, their main goal is to protect businesses and trade from bandits and irresponsible politicians. They have noticeable ties with Hong Kong and German businessmen, making them a target of local anti-concessionists as the AOG struggles to recoup their massive losses from Black Monday and the League Collapse.\n\nIn Guangxi, the provincial assembly is little but a rubber-stamping one for the Army. As such, there is little open opposition to the Guangxi Clique from political groups. The Clique's main enemies currently hide in Yunnan as Li Zongren patiently waits for his chance to strike and retake the province for his own Clique aligned with the right-wing of the Kuomintang."

As such, the two have been cooperating since the dawn of the League in the first place, working together to secure the region's autonomy from Nanjing and, consequently, Beijing.\n\nThe two governors have thus agreed to stay neutral in the conflict in the former League and focus inward instead."

During the Kuomintang's failed war of conquest, he had fled his native province to fight under the Marshall, distinguishing himself as a very able general capable of defeating rebels in the south. Now that he has secured Southern China, he wishes to bring Liangguang back into the fold, which would give us a strong ally in a notoriously rebellious region of the country. Of course, that means he would have significant autonomy from Beijing and we will have to ensure he is protected from rivals in the region."

Seeing the Kuomintang and other warlord states as a threat to China's stability and economic development, he has been highly receptive of the Panasian idea and seeks protection. Of course, we must remember that Chen has ties with the wealthy merchants of China; he will certainly expect some concessions for his loyalty, but his support could be a significant boon to our relations with the Chinese economic elite."

lng.11.d:0 "With war and chaos raging from Shandong to Fujian due to the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, Governor-General of Liangguang, Chen Jiongming, made a speech at the Guangdong Provincial Assembly today addressing a number of issues facing the province.\n\nChen assured the Assembly that neutrality in the conflict to the northwest was the only logical way forward: The stable and prosperous province of Guangdong needed to look inward and focus on improving the province and its inhabitants' livelihoods. The people needed to show the rest of China that their provincial democracy and civilian government was a model to follow, forming a believable alternative to the monarchists in the north, the warlords throughout China and the false revolutionaries of the Kuomintang. This was, Chen believes, the only way to bring peace and unite China in the long-term and rid it of tyrants once and for all."
lng.11.a:0 "Towards a Free China!"

lng.12.t:0 "Governor Chen Criticised in the Assembly"
lng.12.d:0 "Chen Jiongming is a staunch believer in democracy and the Guangdong Provincial Assembly is one of the few truly democratic legislatures in Asia, let alone China. Of course, this means that the Assembly is not only a place to represent the people, debate and enact policy, but also criticise the government.\n\nWith recent decisions made by Chen Jiongming's government to seek support from the gentry to the detriment of his promised land reform, a socialist member of the Assembly was quick criticise the Governor's decision, calling him out on this contradictory decision. This has hurt the Governor's credibility in the eyes of the people and strenghtened the radicals' popularity."
lng.12.a:0 "Such is democracy."

lng.13.t:0 "Peasants Request Financial Aid"
lng.13.d:0 "The province of Guangdong has not been spared from the consequences of Black Monday, regardless of how unwanted German influence is. The peasants have been hit particularly hard as they struggle with the decline of price for rice and grain. Elected representatives from the rural districts arrived at the Provincial Assembly to make their case, requesting financial aid to weather the storm.\n\nChen Jiongming, receiving considerable support from the peasants and rural landowners through his government policies, certainly wants to accept, but the financial situation of the province may make such a program impossible to implement and finance."
lng.13.a:0 "Help them, of course."
lng.13.b:0 "An unfortunate impossibility."

lng.14.t:0 "Merchant Bailouts?"
lng.14.d:0 "Similarly to the peasants' crisis last month, a number of wealthy merchants have hit serious financial difficulties caused by the global economic crisis. A number of members of the Provincial Assembly with ties to the merchant class of the cities and towns have made the case that the provincial government should intervene and keep these merchants from economic ruin. The influence of the merchants in Guangdong is significant and their continued political support is essential, but such a bailout would, of course, be costly."
lng.14.a:0 "Bail them out."
lng.14.b:0 "They can fend for themselves."

lng.15.t:0 "Joint Military Exercises"
lng.15.d:0 "The armies of Guangxi and Guangdong were, until recently, under separate commands. To further improve cohesion between units and officers of the two provincial armies, military exercises have been held fairly regularly. While this had significant benefits for both armies, these exercises have made it more and more obvious of how superior in quality the Guangxi Army is over its Guangdong counterpart. Even if the former is essentially subsidised by the latter's government, the manoeuvres have been, so far, excellent opportunities for the Governor of Guangxi to show off his province's military prowess."
lng.15.a:0 "Guangdong finances, Guangxi fights."

lng.16.t:0 "Suppressing Illegal Gambling"
lng.16.d:0 "Even since entering politics in the years before the Xinhai Revolution, Chen Jiongming has been fighting an arduous battle against gambling in the province, a problem plaguing the province along with opium addiction. In the 1920s, he managed to have it completely banned. Just as with banning the trade and consumption of opium, however, enforcing this ban has been a difficult task and removed an important source of revenue for the government. The Provincial Assembly recently began debating its effectiveness, with a faction pushing for loosening anti-gambling laws.\n\nThe Governor is adamant that this would lead to a return to moral degeneracy in Guangdong along with increased corruption without truly decreasing crime, while his opponents in the Assembly claim that the laws are wasteful and impossible to enforce, instead pushing for its re-legalisation and re-establishment of gambling taxes.\n\nGuangdong is, of course, a democracy, and the Provincial Assembly will vote on the matter."
lng.16.a:0 "The ban on gambling remains."

For his part, Chen reminded his opponents that his proposal for China differed significantly from the American system, and was quick to make parallels between the current states of China and the United States: Its presidential system puts too much power in the hands of the President compared to the legislature, making it no different to the current \"constitutional\" monarchy of China, while comparing \"demagogues\" such as Long and Haywood to Sun Yat-sen and Wang Jingwei - both of which are destabilising or suppressing the democratic institutions of the nation.\n\nWhile Chen Jiongming maintains that the failure of America is not inherently due to federalism or democracy, the argument made obvious the doubts that many people feel towards his proposal."

Hong Kong, Macau, and most recently the German presence in Guangzhou are all continuing, visible symbols of national humiliation that remain very personal to the people of Guangdong, the province which previously included these concessions.\n\nBlack Monday shook the hated German presence to its core, and with the League now gone, their Chinese sycophants and puppets can no longer protect them. Inspired by the riots further north, the Guangzhou anti-concessionists made their own demonstrations in the city's German quarters, which quickly turned into riots. Local police turned a blind eye while several German businesses were damaged and a German citizen was attacked and wounded. The situation was only calmed with the intervention of the Merchant Corps, which managed to disperse the demonstrators.\n\nChen Jiongming, while calling for calm, openly sympathized with the anti-concessionists and criticized both the Unequal Treaties and Beijing's inaction.\n\nThe bold statement was well-received by the people, but some cannot shake the feeling that imperialist reprisals are already on their way."

In response, the Admiralty is preparing to retaliate by sending a squadron of destroyers to attack Guangzhou and remind the Chinese that the German Empire will not tolerate such a blatant violation of international treaties.\n\nOf course, there is no real strategic or tactical value to such an attack on a defenceless city, but it would send a message and ensure that the Chinese people and the rest of the world do not forget that Germany is a world power."

The Provincial Government under Chen Jiongming has been presenting itself as a mediator for disputes between workers and businessmen, which has been largely successful thus far as the Governor maintained a reasonable approach to solve these issues peacefully through compromise.

Despite his early rivalry with Chen Jiongming over the control of Guangdong, the two began cooperating closely after the Qing Restoration, ensuring that Republican and anti-Qing ideals would survive. While his rule was disputed by Li Zongren, in exile in Yunnan, Lu kept Guangxi relatively stable and maintained its regional identity.\n\nWith Ma Ji securing control over the Guangxi Clique, cooperation between the two cliques of Liangguang now appears tenuous as the ambitious new warlord plots to increase his power in southern China."

Li, taking advantage of Lu Rongting's recent passing, clearly hopes to dislodge the current Guangxi Clique and take the province for himself once and for all in the name of the Kuomintang.\n\nMa Ji wants to attack Li in Baise before he has a chance to consolidate and move to Nanning, while Lu Yuguang wants to head north and keep Nanning from getting encircled.

lnggxwar.5.d:0 "Li Zongren's attack on Wuzhou was merely a distraction meant to split Guangxi forces. With Wuzhou easily defended, Li attacked and handily defeated Ma Ji's forces in the city. With the bulk of Guangxi forces under his command, Lu Yuguang will have to retake Nanning by force, where Li has the advantage. Alternatively, he could head west to try and encircle him by taking back Baise. Of course, there is always the option to retreat to friendly Guangdong and dislodge the invaders with their help."
lnggxwar.5.a:0 "Head back to retake Nanning!"
lnggxwar.5.b:0 "Genius! Head west and cut him off!"
lnggxwar.5.c:0 "The war is lost, retreat!"

lnggxwar.6.t:0 "Lu Yuguang Repulsed"
lnggxwar.6.d:0 "Lu Yuguang's attempt to retake Nanning from Li Zongren, who had time to fortify his position, has failed. Unsurprisingly, what is left of Guangxi's forces have defected to Li's new clique, further empowering his right-KMT movement."
lnggxwar.6.a:0 "Li Zongren secures Guangxi."

lnggxwar.7.t:0 "Disintegration of the Guangxi Clique"
lnggxwar.7.d:0 "In the attempt to go up the Hongshui River, a tributary of the Pearl River, and cut off the invaders by retaking Baise, Lu Yuguang's force have desintegrated as they were quickly cut-off and destroyed near the city of Laibin. The Old Guangxi Clique is no more and its remnants have joined up with the new clique, securing Guangxi for Li Zongren's right-wing faction of the KMT."
lnggxwar.7.a:0 "Li Zongren is victorious."

lnggxwar.8.t:0 "Wuzhou Falls; Li Zongren Approaches"
lnggxwar.8.d:0 "News has reached Nanning that Wuzhou fell to a small task force under one of Li Zongren's subordinates, while Li himself is marching down towards Nanning. While Lu Yuguang and others are critical of our inaction and are nervous about being cut-off from Guangdong, Ma Ji believes that their opportunity to attack is long gone and they must further fortify the city. He also believes that Li has no choice but to attack as soon as possible or else risk intervention from Guangdong, while Lu counters that Guangdong will not act unless the road to Nanning is open."
lnggxwar.8.a:0 "Send a small force to Wuzhou."
lnggxwar.8.b:0 "Dig in."

lnggxwar.9.t:0 "Attack on Wuzhou Repulsed; Nanning Falls"
lnggxwar.9.d:0 "Not only has the small force to retake Nanning failed against an entrenched enemy, Nanning has fallen to Li Zongren's relentless assault on the city. The new clique's victory was costly, however, with significant damage to the city. Despite a low number of defections to his forces, Li Zongren has secured Guangxi for the rightist KMT."
lnggxwar.9.a:0 "A costly victory for the New Guangxi Clique"

lnggxwar.10.t:0 "Battle of Nanning"
lnggxwar.10.d:0 "Ma Ji was proven right as Li Zongren's assault on the capital of Guangxi commenced almost as soon as he arrived. Facing the full force of the Guangxi Clique, he was unable to dislodge them from their fortified positions and suffered heavy losses. When it was clear to Li that the clique had not fallen for his diversion and that he faced a disadvantageous situation, he retreated, and Ma Ji now has the chance to destroy Li's threat once and for all. However, with a portion of Li's force heading to Wuzhou as well, more cautious officers advise that they could regroup and cause trouble as bandits later, suggesting that we ask help from Guangdong to mop up Li's forces in and around Wuzhou."
lnggxwar.10.a:0 "Request help from Guangdong."
lnggxwar.10.b:0 "Pursue Li on our own."

lnggxwar.11.t:0 "Li Zongren Defeated"
lnggxwar.11.d:0 "With Guangxi forces pursuing him, Li Zongren's retreat has become more and more disorganised and turned into a rout. The invader's own whereabouts are currently unknown, but what is certain is that he is no longer a threat to Guangxi and the clique's rule is once again secure."
lnggxwar.11.a:0 "A decisive victory!"

lnggxwar.12.t:0 "Chen Mingshu's Decision"
lnggxwar.12.d:0 "Up until now, the Productive People's Party, led by Chen Mingshu and representing the majority of members of the Kuomintang in Liangguang, has been collaborating with Chen Jiongming's big-tent republican coalition. The Nationalists were happy to help develop and participate in democratic institutions in order to protect their interests and legacy after the failed Northern Expedition. This was with the long-term goal of peacefully implementing Mínquán, Sun Yat-sen's Principle of popular government. Besides, Chen's Federalists protected them from Zhili and Qing retribution.\n\nLi Zongren's seizure of Guangxi has completely changed the situation. While Chen Mingshu hardly trusts the rightist warlord despite both being members of the KMT, a golden opportunity presents itself: If he could get rid of Chen Jiongming, Liangguang would be secured for the Nationalist Party without bloodshed. He remains hesitant to betray him, however, after over a decade of protection and cooperation. Still, the Party's Central Committee has hatched a plan: Seize key buildings in Guangzhou and force Chen Jiongming, who has strong misgivings about fighting in the city, to surrender.\n\nAll Chen Mingshu has to do is give the order."
lnggxwar.12.a:0 "Li is but an untrustworthy bandit."
lnggxwar.12.b:0 "Start the operation."

lnggxwar.13.t:0 "KMT Seizes Guangzhou"
lnggxwar.13.d:0 "Early in the morning, under the cover of the general mobilization against Guangxi, armed members of the KMT began seizing key buildings around the city, including the Guangdong University and the Provincial Assembly Building. Soon, Chen Mingshu announced the formation of the Guangdong People's Government, the deposition of Chen Jiongming, and a call for peace with Guangxi province.\n\nAs expected, Chen Jiongming announced that, while he refused to recognize the new government, he refused to allow the city to suffer unnecessary bloodshed and destruction. He and his close supporters left for Hong Kong later that day, leaving the city in the hands of the Nationalist Party."
lnggxwar.13.a:0 "Bloodshed avoided."

lngcivilwar.2.t:0 "Lu Ronting's Funeral"
lngcivilwar.2.d:0 "Governor-General Chen Jiongming has been invited to former governor Lu Ronting's funeral as a guest of honour by the leadership of Guangxi. A traditional affair, Chen accepted the offer, hoping to foster greater unity between the two provinces in such trying times."
lngcivilwar.2.a:0 "A show of unity."

lngcivilwar.3.t:0 "Guarding the Body"
lngcivilwar.3.d:0 "As part of Chinese funeral traditions, Lu Rongting's body is on display at the former governor's residence, with family and close friends watching over the deceased. While Governor-General Chen and some close associates were part of the guard for the day, unknown assailants approached him, brandishing handguns. A firefight quickly ensued."
lngcivilwar.3.a:0 "The entourage is gunned down."
lngcivilwar.3.b:0 "The assailants fail and lay dead."

lngcivilwar.4.t:0 "Assassination of Chen Jiongming"
lngcivilwar.4.d:0 "Unable to react in time, Governor-General Chen Jiongming and his associates were gunned down by assassins under orders from Governor Ma Ji of Guangxi. News reached Guangdong quickly as Guangxi rapidly mobilised against them, but a question remains in the minds of the eastern province's leadership: Who will succeed Chen Jiongming as governor of Guangdong?\n\nChen Mingshu is an estranged member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang. While not opposed to the KMT in Fujian, he resents Wang Jingwei's authoritarian leadership of the party, being a more genuine believer in democracy than a number of party members.\n\nChen Lianbo is head of the Merchant Corps, the militia of the Chinese merchant class of Guangzhou. He has been an early opponent to the late Chen Jiongming's more socialistic and populist policies and wishes to protect the merchants' interests in the region first and foremost."
lngcivilwar.4.a:0 "Chen Mingshu"
lngcivilwar.4.b:0 "Chen Lianbo"

lngcivilwar.5.t:0 "Failed Attempt on Governor Chen"
lngcivilwar.5.d:0 "Reacting in time to their assailants, Chen Jiongming and his associates managed to escape unscathed. It was quickly realised that they were under Guangxi Governor Ma Ji and they quickly made their way out of Nanning. By the time they reached Guangdong, the Guangxi clique had already mobilised their armies, ready to take leadership of Liangguang by force. Upon his return, Governor-General Chen made an impromptu speech to the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, rallying them against the tyranical warlord of Guangxi and to defend their hard-earned liberties."
lngcivilwar.5.a:0 "The Dyarchy falls."

lngcivilwar.6.t:0 "The Second Guangdong-Guangxi War"
lngcivilwar.6.d:0 "The Dyarchy has fallen as the two provinces have been unable to settle their differences diplomatically. The new warlord of Guangxi is unwilling to recognise Guangdong's supremacy over Liangguang and his ambitions cannot coexist with the ideals of his eastern counterpart. Both cliques have now taken up arms; Liangguang's future will thus be settled on the battlefield."
lngcivilwar.6.a:0 "[GXC.GetLeader] will prevail!"
lngcivilwar.6.b:0 "Guangxi will take over!"

lngcivilwar.7.t:0 "Mobilisation of the Merchant Corps"
lngcivilwar.7.d:0 "The Canton Merchants' Public Safety Organization, simply known as the Merchant Corps, has mobilised their militia to help us put down the Guangxi rebels. With their interests in both provinces in danger, the merchants of Guangzhou has cast their lot on our side, giving us control over one of southern China's best troops."
lngcivilwar.7.a:0 "Their support is welcome."

lngcivilwar.8.t:0 "Mobilisation of the Rural Militia"
lngcivilwar.8.d:0 "A large part of both Guangxi and Guangdong's Militia Corps is under the command of the rural gentry. With their interests endangered by the ongoing conflict between the two provinces, the gentry has decided to fully support us and their militia are now under our command."
lngcivilwar.8.a:0 "A needed boost to our numbers."

lngcivilwar.9.t:0 "Rebel AI Guangxi Wins"

lngcivilwar.11.t:0 "Rebel AI Guangxi Wins way too quickly"
lngcivilwar.11.d:0 "You shouldn't see this. If you do, send a bug report. This is just needed as a way to circumvent how buggy vanilla civil wars are."

lngcivilwar.12.a:0 "Okay."

lngcivilwar.13.t:0 "Ma Ji Secures Lianggang"
lngcivilwar.13.d:0 "The warlord of Guangxi is victorious over the Guangdong rebels. With the two Guangs secured, Ma Ji is now able to push his ambitions towards the rest of southern China and beyond."
lngcivilwar.13.a:0 "Guangxi's power grows."

lngcivilwar.14.t:0 "Chen Lianbo Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.14.d:0 "The head of the Merchant Corps, Chen Lianbo, has secured the General-Governorship of Liangguang after defeating the Guangxi rebels. Without a doubt, the new governor will focus on economic development and the protection of the Chinese merchants' interests in the region above all."
lngcivilwar.14.a:0 "Prosperity first."

lngcivilwar.15.t:0 "Chen Mingshu Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.15.d:0 "Chen Mingshu, head of the Productive Peoples' Party and former Kuomintang member, has defeated the Guangxi rebels and secured control of Liangguang. As Governor-General, Chen will likely align the provinces towards the KMT in Fujian and is known to support Soong Ching-ling's faction there."
lngcivilwar.15.a:0 "Another victory for the KMT!"

lngcivilwar.16.t:0 "Chen Jiongming Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.16.d:0 "Despite internal opposition and the revolt of the Guangxi Clique, Chen Jiongming has remained at the head of Liangguang. With his rule and popularity more secure than ever, he will have the ability to push further towards his ideals should the situation in the rest of the region allow it: A federal and truly democratic China."
lngcivilwar.16.a:0 "Chen will free China!"

lngcivilwar.17.t:0 "Reintegration of the Rebel Army"
lngcivilwar.17.d:0 "For the most part, the soldiers and even generals of warlord or provincial armies tended to be more concerned about defending their homes from invaders and bandits rather than matters of national importance. As such, we can reintegrate the rebel army with relative ease once their treacherous leaders are deal with. After all, they are fellow Chinese. Even if they previously served the wrong master, they can still redeem themselves or return to their homes."
lngcivilwar.17.a:0 "They will now serve a greater purpose."

lngcivilwar.18.t:0 "Old Guangxi Clique Seeks Asylum"
lngcivilwar.18.d:0 "Ma Ji and Lu Yuguang, leaders of the clique that formerly ruled Guangxi, have fled their homes after a power struggle. The two are old friends that once served under us during the war with the Kuomintang and they have asked to serve in our armed forces after being forced out of Guangxi, perhaps seeking a way to restore their rule someday."
lngcivilwar.18.a:0 "They will have to find a new home elsewhere."
lngcivilwar.18.b:0 "Of course, these old friends are welcome."

lngcivilwar.19.t:0 "Fate of Guangdong"
lngcivilwar.19.d:0 "Now that Guangdong is under our control, we must choose who will replace the previous provincial government. The top brass of the Clique is arguing for total exploitation of the developed province in order to fuel Guangxi's own development and, more important, fund an increasingly large and modern army. Of course, this is arguably rather short-sighted, and more politically-knowledgeable members of the Clique argue that we should hand over the provincial governments to the local elites so that the province isn't sucked dry."
lngcivilwar.19.a:0 "Exploit them!"
lngcivilwar.19.b:0 "We must be careful- let the locals handle it."

lngcivilwar.20.t:0 "Li Zongren Secures Liangguang"
lngcivilwar.20.d:0 "Li Zongren, an estranged member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, managed to take over Liangguang by force. Unlike the KMT in Fujian, Li is a member of the party's right-wing, which was thought to have been purged by the left-wing along with Hu Hanmin's execution in 1925. The left-wing of the Kuomintang, until now uncontested leaders of the Nationalists, now have a very real threat to the Party's leadership."
lngcivilwar.20.a:0 "The real KMT has returned."

lngcivilwar.21.t:0 "Provincial KMT Leader Meet"
lngcivilwar.21.d:0 "With Chen Mingshu as governor of Guangdong and Li Zongren having ousted the Old Guangxi Clique, the two governors have met to discuss the future of Liangguang. The two men are essentially members of the Kuomintang, but are aligned with different factions within the party. Chen is aligned with Soong's Minquan faction while Li is de facto leader of the right-wing. While the two have differing views on how to proceed with the National Revolution, they both agree that they must form a unified government to secure the Party's position in southern China and have asked its members in the two provinces to choose their new regional leader."
lngcivilwar.21.a:0 "Chen Mingshu will fight for democracy."
lngcivilwar.21.b:0 "Unification at all costs with Li Zongren."

lngcivilwar.22.t:0 "Bai Chongxi Departs for Guangxi"
lngcivilwar.22.d:0 "Bai Chongxi left Yunnan earlier today with his men to join with his brother-in-arms, Li Zongren, in Guangxi. The latter recently became leader of the province after a power struggle with the previous clique in charge and is now in charge of the Kuomintang's right-wing in Nanning. Bai Chongxi has always been loyal to him first and foremost, and his departure was expected and unchallenged."
lngcivilwar.22.a:0 "Best of luck, I suppose."

lngcivilwar.24.t:0 "New Guangxi Clique Returns"
lngcivilwar.24.d:0 "Li Zongren's Clique was defeated in Guangxi and was forced into hiding. With Yunnan safely in the hands of the Kuomintang, they have returned, hoping to continue the fight with us and pledge their support and abilities to the National Revolutionary Army."
lngcivilwar.24.a:0 "Their revolution continues here."

lngraids.1.t:0 "Raiding German Indochina"
lngraids.1.d:0 "As the Germans are busy maintaining order in their colony, their border with us remains relatively unprotected. This makes them a prime target to raid, especially as they have poorly-defended outposts all over northern Indochina where we can easily grab supplies and equipment."
lngraids.1.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.1.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.2.t:0 "Raiding Indochina"
lngraids.2.d:0 "As the Indochinese War was a recent ordeal that they are still recovering from, Indochina remains a good target for raiding. There is bound to be equipment from the war that we can recover and salvage with little fear of resistance from exhausted Indochinese forces."
lngraids.2.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.2.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.3.t:0 "Raiding Yunnan"
lngraids.3.d:0 "The leaders of Yunnan Province have been our rivals for decades now. Their forces are formidable, but not perfect. The border between Yunnan and Guangxi is mountainous, which makes sneaking it a relatively simply affair."
lngraids.3.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.3.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.4.t:0 "Raiding Hunan"
lngraids.4.d:0 "Hunan has seen its fair share of trouble since the collapse of the League. While relatively stable, there are numerous factions vying for power and none of them are friendly to us. While they are distracted by internal affairs, we should strike."
lngraids.4.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.4.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.5.t:0 "Raiding the Nationalists"
lngraids.5.d:0 "The Nationalists have been a thorn to stability in China, which works in our favour. Their radicalism makes them inherently unstable, and we can strike them at any time as they struggle to achieve their deluded ideals."
lngraids.5.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.5.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.6.t:0 "Raiding the League"
lngraids.6.d:0 "The League is weak. Always was, always will be. The further from Nanjing, the easier it is for us to send raiders in, taking advantage of their internal dissention to acquire some more advanced hardware they themselves acquired from the German imperialists."
lngraids.6.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.6.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.7.t:0 "Raiding the International Concessions"
lngraids.7.d:0 "The imperialist Legations have been a constant symbol of humiliation for the Chinese people. Finding volunteers to send into their protected zones will be easy, and there are plenty of locals more than happy to support them against the westerners."
lngraids.7.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.7.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.8.t:0 "Raiding the German Concessions"
lngraids.8.d:0 "The blatantly-illegal consessions of the AOG are a great target for our raiders: The locals hate them, they have quality equipment for us to seize, and their defence forces are spread thin and unreliable. Raiding them is not only justified, but righteous."
lngraids.8.a:0 "Send a small expedition."
lngraids.8.b:0 "Send a large expedition."

lngraids.9.t:0 "Successful Bandit Attack"
lngraids.9.d:0 "One of our isolated military outposts by the border has been attacked by raiders. With chaos ruling China, we can only guess who they serve, if anyone at all. We know that they have already stolen military equipment from us, and intervening might be fruitless anyways, but it is clear that local forces will struggle to repel the raids. Regardless of whether we send troops in to help or not, we will have to secure our borders or the raids will continue."
lngraids.9.a:0 "Send reinforcements."
lngraids.9.b:0 "The local defenses will have to make due."

lngraids.10.t:0 "Raid Unsuccessful"
lngraids.10.d:0 "Our raiders returned empty-handed today. A combination of poor recon and local defenses had forced them to retreat without reaching their objective. While they have failed, they have all returned safe and sound without alerting enemy forces."
lngraids.10.a:0 "Too bad."

lngraids.11.t:0 "Failed Bandit Attack"
lngraids.11.d:0 "Bandits attacked one of our isolated military outposts by the border earlier today. Our troops, thankfully, managed to pull together and utterly destroy them despite the odds. These fools are certainly not returning anytime soon after our glorious forces dealt them such a crushing defeat. Sadly, we could not find out if they were acting under orders or simply bandits desperate for resources."
lngraids.11.a:0 "They were no match."

lngraids.12.t:0 "Successful Bandit Attack"
lngraids.12.d:0 "One of our isolated military outposts by the border has been attacked by a large band raiders. With chaos ruling China, we can only guess who they serve, if anyone at all. We know that they have already stolen a significant amount of military equipment from us, and intervening might be fruitless anyways, but it is clear that local forces will struggle to repel the raids. Regardless of whether we send troops in to help or not, we will have to secure our borders or the raids will continue."
lngraids.12.a:0 "We can't let them get away with this!"
lngraids.12.b:0 "It's too late."

lngraids.13.t:0 "Successful Raid"
lngraids.13.d:0 "Our raid has been successful. Losses were minimal and we were able to seize a decent amount of rifles and grenades from the enemy."
lngraids.13.a:0 "Glory to us!"

lngraids.14.t:0 "Disastrous Raid"
lngraids.14.d:0 "Our raiders were utterly defeated by local enemy troops, forcing us to retreat with serious losses. We will certainly not be able to attack them again anytime soon."
lngraids.14.a:0 "Damn!"

lngraids.15.t:0 "Very Successful Raid"
lngraids.15.d:0 "Our daring raid has borne fruit. Not only did they totally crush local resistance, but our raiders left with a large amount of equipment, including a number of artillery pieces. This will definitely help us reinforce our own armies while our enemies lay humiliated."
lngraids.15.a:0 "Glory to us!"

Through the willpower of our loyal divisions, we were able to finally eject the Governor from Xinjiang, and are still prepared to defend our homeland. However, the Federalists are now making overtures towards a ceasefire. This could be due to the tenuous legitimacy the final Xinjiang Governor could claim, or due to our might. Either way, we can choose to play along to this proposal or venture forward to conquest."

fedsturkwp.3.t:0 "Federalists Deny Peace Offer"
fedsturkwp.3.d:0 "The Federalists have denounced our government as an insurgent force trying to overthrow Chinese soverignity in Xinjiang. The Federal President has even promised his people a return to the legitimate Chinese governorship of Xinjiang, and the end to obviously alien influence in the Province.

 lngkmt.1.t: "Kuomintang Demands our Submission"
 lngkmt.1.d: "Li Zongren's Kuomintang in Guangzhou has began mobilising his forces against us. His impossible demands were formally given to us today: Our government would submit to the KMT's Central Committee, armies absorbed into the National Revolutionary Army. In exchange, we would stay as governor of our province and its army, albeit under their supervision."

 lngkmt.4.d: "With Chen Jiongming's Federalist dictatorship driven out and [ROOT.GetLeader] having taken control of the Kuomintang Central Committee in Guangzhou (the former birthplace of the National Revolution), the expected proclamation arrived today: A new Republic of China is to be founded, with the National Revolutionary Army once more taking leadership of Sun Yat-sen's legacy and National Revolution. It will be an uphill battle, but it is the last hope for the Chinese Nationalist Party to claim victory from the jaws of defeat and free China."
 lngkmt.4.a: "Zhonghua Minguo Wansui."

 lngkmt.5.t: "Guangdong Elites Protest"
 lngkmt.5.d: "Immediately after the proclamation came dissenting voices. The local elites of Liangguang, mainly the Gentry of the countryside and the Merchants of Guangzhou, have voiced their misgivings in a new Northern Expedition. The first one was an abject failure, with Chiang Kai-shek failing to fulfil Sun Yat-sen's dreams and the Kuomintang sapping the South of all its wealth and prosperity. The failure is quite vivid in the people's memory; the Gentry is weary of the Kuomintang's history of expropriation of demands for land reform while the Merchants keenly remember their violent purging in the Merchants' Corps Incident in 1924. The commander-in-chief is confident that the Gentry can be reassured in a timely manner, but the Merchants are far more hostile and demanding; dealing with them will likely require some sacrifices."
 lngkmt.5.a: "They will toe the line soon enough."

 lngkmt.6.t: "Beginning of Political Tutelage"
 lngkmt.6.d: "Political Tutelage is the second stage in Sun Yat-sen's Three Stages of the National Revolution. With the country reunited, the National Revolutionary Army will begin to loosen their grip on power, while the Party will cement its own. This way, the Kuomintang will continue to guide China towards the third and final stage and become a democratic republic. However, for this to succeed, the people must be educated so that they understand their civic duties and rights and participate in public institutions. This is to create a healthy democracy and avoid the failures of the Xinhai Revolution."
 lngkmt.6.a: "China will be free. Eventually."

 lngkmt.7.t: "Appointing a Premier"
 lngkmt.7.d: "Generalissimo Li Zongren should not be directing the National Revolution alone. As part of the reforms to create a government as outlined by Sun Yat-sen, an Executive Yuan, one of the five branches of government, will be appointed. This council will essentially act as a cabinet and its President as head of government in Western terms (as such, the President of the Executive Yuan is known as the \"Premier\" in the West).\n\nTwo choices have been presented to the Generalissimo to preside the Executive Yuan: Sun Fo, Sun Yat-sen's son, is seen as a natural candidate to reunify the factionalised Party, and Zhu Peide, one of the NRA's leaders and prominent member of the party's moderate right-wing. The first would help heal the divide within the Nationalist Party, while the second would maintain the National Revolutionary Army's political influence and the right-wing's leading role."

Debate is expected to be fierce for many members are hoping to introduce elections next year, while others do not believe that Political Tutelage should end yet and wish to postpone the decision for next year."

 lngkmt.9.c: "Delay indefinitely."

 lngkmt.10.t: "First Election of the Legislative Yuan"
 lngkmt.10.d: "The time has come. Political Tutelage is coming to an end and the next Legislative Yuan is to be elected by the people. While political activity outside of the Kuomintang remains limited, the Kuomintang's left-of-centre faction is campaigning fiercely for further reforms, adding a layer of democratic pluralism unseen in China for a long time."
 lngkmt.10.a: "The Centre-Right is strengthened."
 lngkmt.10.b: "The Centre-Left gains a foothold."

 lngkmt.11.t: "The Elections of [GetYear]"
 lngkmt.11.d: "As another election approaches the party-state, the functionaries and party bosses in the Kuomintang scurry to at least go through the motions of practicing democratic processes. At [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], recently elected delegates of the national assembly prepare to vote for the President of the Republic. With the KMT holding virtually every seat in the assembly since last year's legislative election, there was little doubt about who would win. To maintain appearances, [ROOT.GetLeader] has encouraged Sun Fo to run a token opposition campaign, however in the end the outcome was in little doubt. By a major landslide, the voters chose..."
 lngkmt.11.a: "The status quo is strengthened."
 lngkmt.11.b: "Reformists are strengthened."

 lngkmt.12.t: "Request from the Central Committee"
 lngkmt.12.d: "The reorganised Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou has sent a simple request that we rejoin their ranks. This means putting ourselves under their command and supervision. For the good of the nation, of course."
 lngkmt.12.a: "Of course. For the Republic!"
 lngkmt.12.b: "This is encroaching on our autonomy!"

 lngkmt.13.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Refuses our Request"
 lngkmt.13.d: "The treacherous dogs in [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to comply! They have essentially refused to recognise the authority of the Central Committee and they shall receive the punishment befitting traitors."
 lngkmt.13.a: "They will pay."

 lngkmt.14.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Rejoins the Central Committee"
 lngkmt.14.d: "Our friends in [FROM.GetNameDef] have, of course, accepted our request and have rejoined our ranks."
 lngkmt.14.a: "For the Republic!"

 lngkmt.19.t: "Status of the Temples in Guangdong"
 lngkmt.19.d: "A famous story amongst the schoolchildren of Guangdong is how Sun Yat-sen vandalised an image of the patron deity of his hometown in Xiangshan county. Yet as the Federalists and Nationalists bicker over the status and regime of Guangdong, the question of religion persists. Proponents of both governments are eager to move away from the imperial past as deity worship would serve to integrate state and society.\n\nModern concepts such as evolution and rationalism have indeed entered Guangdong society, and there is no doubt that much of the city’s administration believes that Guangdong should take its place as a “model province” - one that displays modernity and westernisation in comparison to the backward cities of the warlords and the Qing. But temples and religious rituals have been a part of Chinese traditions for centuries, and the outward removal of such would undoubtedly spark dissent among the local population. In imperial China, the city god played an essential role in urban administration - the city god was considered a co-ruler of the city. For example, in Guangzhou, officials made their way to the City God Temple to invoke blessings such as rain or protection from ghosts.\n\nBut for the Federalists and the Kuomintang, the jointly ruled cities are a fabrication of the past, a physical depiction of the backwardness that has plagued China into a century of humiliation. To the modernists, the temples are a place of ignorance and disorder - the “old China” that must be destroyed. However, for the ordinary people of China, these temples carry a significant meaning of cultural and religious pride and significance. Businesses such as fortune-telling are held here, and even disputes are mediated by the city god. The temple was the centre of community life, and to simply eradicate them would undoubtedly earn the wrath of the populace."
 lngkmt.19.a: "Out with the Old!"
 lngkmt.19.b: "We are not going to destroy our own temples!"

 lngkmt.20.t: "The Opium Dens of Guangzhou"
 lngkmt.20.d: "The stench of opium permeates throughout all of China, the cursed plant that has brought nothing but an addiction. While not as prevalent as in other parts of China, opium has perverted itself into Guangdong society and culture. Often depicted as dank halls of infamy, the reality is that the opium houses of Guangzhou are pretty fashionable - clean and nice-looking buildings for the elite to partake in. From the lowest of the coolie to the elite, opium smoking is a popular socialite pastime in Guangdong. Considered premier entertainment venues, the 500+ opium houses are undoubtedly a part of the fabric that makes up Guangzhou. Opium houses ranged from shady dens to the high-class “Gaodeng tanhuaguan” fitted with modern amenities such as radios, heaters, and electric fans.\n\nThe sale of raw opium and permits of possession of opium constitutes a form of indispensable revenue for Guangzhou. As the [ROOT.GetAdjective] regime solidifies their control of Guangzhou; they will be in control of the opium houses. And yet, despite the profit and temptation, opium certainly has its enemies. Anti opium organisations such as the Woman’s Anti Drug Association and the Guangzhou branch of the National Anti-Opium Association clamour to eradicate the drug that has had China hooked. Suppression of the houses would certainly spark dissent but would be the first step in defeating the menace; however, keeping the houses would earn provide us with a great source of income..."
 lngkmt.20.a: "We will not have this poison in our city!"
 lngkmt.20.b: "Leave them alone, we need the funds."

 lngkmt.21.t: "Chinese High Tea"
 lngkmt.21.d: "The concept of Dim Sum originates in Guangdong province as a popular form of breakfast or lunch. Dim sum refers to small dishes that “lightly touch your heart without filling your stomach,” while “yum cha” is the practice of drinking tea. Arriving in China during the Song Dynasty, the practice of dim sum has incorporated influences from not just China but also around the world. Up until the 1920s, however, the practice of yum cha and consuming dim sum was only a privilege allocated to the elite and wealthy. Customers to high-end pavilions would inspect tea leaves to verify their temperature and quality to dine in privacy and comfort.\n\nHowever, nowadays, the practice of dim sum has extended to people with average incomes, students, and government employees. Indeed Guangzhou’s teahouse culture has led to the creation of chefs with celebrity-like status and thus heavy competition between teahouses. New varieties of dim sum are being invented almost daily - influenced heavily by the tea pastry dishes of Shanghai, Beijing, and the West. However, as the situation in China continues to become unstable and war more frequent, more and more chefs are taking their culinary expertise to nearby Hong Kong. Nonetheless, the ancient practice of dim sum will undoubtedly continue to carry on, a true form of cultural pride and significance for the Cantonese people."
 lngkmt.21.a: "Let's eat!"

 lngkmt.22.t: "Remembering the Martyrs"
 lngkmt.22.d: "Guangdong... the cradle of the revolution. Ever since the collapse of the Ming Dynasty, dissent towards the Manchu rulers of the north has been ever so prevalent in the southernmost province of China. Guangdong is indeed the birthplace of the national revolution. The martyrs of the revolution were born in Guangdong such as the 72 martyrs who gave their lives in the Second Guangzhou Uprising to get rid of the Qing. Like a suicide squad, they wrote letters to their loved ones before they carried out their fateful activities. Indeed the spirit of martyrdom would be carried on in the Dare to Die Corps, patriots willing to give their lives for a freer China in the subsequent revolution of 1911 and the Northern Expedition. With the return of the Qing, the sacrifices of the martyrs were indeed put into question. Were their sacrifices in vain?\n\nNo more. With the return of a republican government in Guangzhou however, this has changed. Like the mythical phoenix, the movement towards a free China is born again! We have regrouped and are more invigorated to avenge our fallen brothers and to rid ourselves of the pollution that is the Qing Dynasty. We will avenge our brothers and undertake a new expedition to the north. The martyrs will be glorified and remembered in statues and prose from all over China. With our position secured, we will plan, we will practise, and we will be ready to depose the Qing despots once and for all."

 lngkmt.23.d.annexed: "After the failed Northern Expedition, the remaining members of the 3rd NRA returned to Yunnan in order to build up a new career within Tang Jiyao's administration and with the province now under our control, we have the opportunity to reintegrate the lost members of the KMT into the NRA. Generals Zhu Peide, He Yingqin and Kim Hong-il are loyal members of the KMT and will be given the opportunity to put their talents to good use within the NRA. Generals Fan Shisheng, Jin Handing and Luo Binghui are also candidates to be integrated into the NRA however their loyalty to the KMT is uncertain."
 lngkmt.23.d.long_yun: "After the failed Northern Expedition, the remaining members of the 3rd NRA returned to Yunnan in order to build up a new career within Tang Jiyao's administration. However, after General Long Yun secured Yunnan following the bloody civil war, the generals of the Kuomintang decided to flee the province - fearing for their lives. Generals Zhu Peide, He Yingqin and Kim Hong-il are loyal members of the KMT and will be given the opportunity to put their talents to good use within the NRA. Generals Fan Shisheng, Jin Handing and Luo Binghui are also candidates to be integrated into the NRA however their loyalty to the KMT is uncertain."

 lngkmt.30.t: "Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue Arrive in Guangzhou"
 lngkmt.30.d: "This morning, the former National Revolutionary Army generals Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue arrived in Guangzhou with their humble petition to receive commissions to serve in Liangguang's NRA.\n\nHaving spent the last years in exile following the collapse of the Northern Expedition, the two men fled to India, where they acted as advisors and mentors to an overseas Sino-Indian Military Mission. Upon their return to China following the League War, they pledged their services to the leftist-dominated Central Committee. It would appear, however, that they have chosen the wrong side. The left wing of the party, broken as always due to their constant factional infighting, has fled once more into exile with their most recent defeat during the League War.\nBoth men do not share leftist sentiments with Zhang, having once led the Fourth Army of the Kuomintang alongside generals such as Chen Jitang and Li Jishen. Do we trust our former comrades, or should we send them off into exile once more?"
 lngkmt.30.a: "Comrades, once more!"
 lngkmt.30.b: "You have tasted exile once, now taste it again."

 lngkmt.40.t: "The Question of the Constitution"
 lngkmt.40.d: "Years have passed since the Kuomintang's Guangzhou Military Government set out to unify China under the flag of the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth. In those days, it was necessary - if not paramount for the country to be under the protective guidance of the Kuomintang party. The Chinese Kuomintang was to be the party for the people, but it had to guide them carefully to a state of democracy.\n\nWith the unification of the party, however, many of the liberal and leftist factions of the Kuomintang have begun to clamour for the opening up of the political forum and for Generalissimo Li Zongren to declare an end to martial law and political tutelage. Led by politicians such as Song Qingling and Sun Fo, the liberal coalition has demanded that Li help ratify the new \"Five Power Constitution\", which the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen originally proposed.\n\nNonetheless, right-wing radicals and conservative elements within the military have implored the Generalissimo to hold off on ratifying the constitution. There were still plenty of Zhili, Manchu, German, and syndicalist hideouts across the country, and the government must be led by the Generalissimo - as he alone would have the power to control China through his leadership."
 lngkmt.40.a: "Ratify it and promise elections in the coming year..."
 lngkmt.40.b: "The period of tutelage must continue!"

 lngkmt.50.t: "The Congress of [GetYear] is Held"
 lngkmt.50.d: "Today in [GXC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Generalissimo [GXC.GetLeader] announced the opening of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang. In a gesture of goodwill, he has allowed the other political organisations and cliques of the Kuomintang to participate in the Kuomintang's demonstration of its democratic centralism. Absent from the National Congress would be the Chinese Syndicalist Party, which following the collapse of the previously left-wing dominated Central Committee, rejected the leadership of the Guangzhou Kuomintang as \"illegitimate reactionaries.\"\n\nRepresenting the far-left of the party would be the former Chairman of the party, Wang Jingwei, and his Reorganised Comrades Association. He is followed by the Provisional Action Committee, co-led by Chen Mingshu and Song Qingling - the former has graciously stepped down in favour of the popular widow of the late Dr. Sun.\n\nThe \"political centre\" of the Kuomintang is led by Sun Fo's Reconstruction clique and Lin Sen's Western Hills Clique. They are also joined by the moderate but business related \"Political Science Clique\" led by Zhang Qun. It is followed by the right wing of the party, primarily military leaders who are loyal first to the Generalissimo and then to the party second.\nUltimately, the Congress came to the compromise that the tutelage period will remain until China is recovered enough. Whether or not that will come true...remains to be seen for now."
 lngkmt.50.a: "The delegates take their seats..."

 lngkmt.51.t: "The National Anthem of the Republic of China"
 lngkmt.51.d: "A beautiful and artistic collaboration between the greatest minds of the Chinese Kuomintang from Liao Zhongkai, Shao Yuanchong, Dai Jitao, and the late Hu Hanmin, by a near-unanimous vote by the Kuomintang's new central committee - the new national anthem of the country was adopted to become the "The Three Principles of the People officially." The song's lyrics come from the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's opening preamble to the Whampoa Military Academy's first class and has enjoyed a newfound popularity since the country's unification. Some dissenting opinions within the Kuomintang's political sphere have argued that having a political party song to represent an entire nation is wrong and dictatorial - but the Central Committee has sponsored the National Anthem Editing and Research Committee to promote the party song across the country."
 lngkmt.51.a: "Wonderful!"

 lngkmt.52.t: "The Policy on the Minzu"
 lngkmt.52.d: "\"Article I: The territory of the Republic of China consists of the various Provinces and Mongolia and Tibet.\"\n\nAs one of the most controversial platforms of the Kuomintang, the Chinese Kuomintang believes that the regions of Mongolia and Tibet are firmly Chinese territories. Much of Sun Yat-sen's writings and indeed those that are cherished by the Kuomintang's right wing see China as a nation locked amongst other nations in a struggle of natural selection. The idea of \"Minzu\" revolves around a common livelihood, language, religion, customs, and most importantly, a shared bloodline. To China's non-Han Minzu, Sun would dismiss them as numerically insignificant. After all, the Han people resisted extermination and even assimilated their occupiers, the Yuan Mongols and the Qing Manchus. Nonetheless, Sun's writings on imperialism warned that China has been in a steady period of decline, and if China fell victim to imperialism, it would most certainly be exterminated.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Sun implied that China's past history of benevolent imperialism differs significantly from the imperialism practised by the West and Japan. Historically, China's expansion was based on the recognition of the Chinese cultural supremacy among her neighbours and the hierarchical world order of the tribute system. This type of consensual veneration, Sun argues, does not exist among those western subjects of imperialism."
 lngkmt.52.a: "We maintain the late Premier's policies."

 lngkmt.53.t: "Anti-Imperialism"
 lngkmt.53.d: "Another issue between the delegates at the conference was the nature of the Kuomintang's anti-imperialism. Harkening to the days of the \"revolutionary\" Kuomintang, the leftists of the congress have argued that the Kuomintang must take an active anti-colonial stance in freeing Asia from the chains of foreign imperialism and to fight against colonialism actively.\n\nNonetheless, Generalissimo [GXC.GetLeader] finds a compelling argument in members of the Political Science Clique, bankers and industrialists who argue that in China's present state - forming economic ties and forging relationships with the West, for now, is the best way to lead the revolution in China. They argue that China's industrial base is so limited that it will most definitely require investments from the great industrialised nations of the world. This argument has been condemned by members of the left-wing, especially the RCA, who have denounced the regime as failing to meet the objectives of what they claim Dr. Sun's vision to be."
 lngkmt.53.a: "We will tread carefully among the West."

 lngkmt.54.t: "The NEC"
 lngkmt.54.d: "Created in accordance with the principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the National Reconstruction Commission is to be led by a new central planning organisation, the National Economic Council (NEC).\n\nLed by the dynamic Harvard graduate Song Ziwen, the financial advisor Kong Xiangxi, and the left-wing socialist Chen Gongbo, the National Economic Council's primary goals are to develop the coastal industrial economy. The NEC's works are devoted to water conservancy, transportation, public health, and agriculture, with their most ambitious idea being the Cotton Control Commission or the CCC. Furthermore, the NEC also reflects the anti-imperialism movement by promoting the coastal Chinese economy as an alternative to the poor economic practices of the Guangxi Clique.\n\nThis eclectic combination of the industrialist Song Ziwen and the Marxist Chen Gongbo traces a shared lineage in both men's visions for a state-centred and nationalist-oriented reconstruction. Within these parameters, they advocate for economic and institutional reforms aimed at improving the country's economy, led by the direction of the state. It is only appropriate that they deem their practices \"national capitalism\" and envision China's coastal cities becoming new economic zones for the country's modernisation."
 lngkmt.54.a: "Can we realise National Capitalism?"

 lngkmt.55.t: "The Fate of Puyi"
 lngkmt.55.d: "Inevitably as the congress draws to a conclusion, there is the issue of what to do with the captured Puyi, captured in the final days of the wars of unification. The former \"Son of Heaven\" now lays meek and ashamed in a jail cell, and is fate is to be determined by the Central Committee.\n\nWhile members of the left and the liberals, such as Sun Fo, have advocated for Puyi to be pardoned and to encourage the former Qing Emperor to flee into exile - members of the right-wing, especially the Generalissimo, have backed Puyi to be shot. Puyi represents one of the greatest Hanjian to ever grace Chinese history, having worked with the Germans to crush the National Revolution and reinstalled the Qing Empire - reversing the sacrifices that the martyrs died for in the Xinhai Revolution. Ultimately, the fate of Puyi is determined to be that he is..."
 lngkmt.55.a: "Give the fatal order..."
 lngkmt.55.b: "Send him far away from China."

 lngkmt.56.t: "The Congress Concludes"
 lngkmt.56.d: "Finally after much discourse, the First National Congress of the Kuomintang has concluded. The Generalissimo has promised to revisit the idea of ending political tutelage after the era of reconstruction is complete. However, until then - China will remain a one-party state as all will know that only the glorious party of the Chinese Kuomintang can bring back honour and freedom for the Chinese people. Long live the Kuomintang, Long live the Republic of China!"
 lngkmt.56.a: "Wansui!"

 lngkmt.60.t: "Our Ties to the Shanghai Underground"
 lngkmt.60.d: "From the dying addict on the street to the high-class businessmen in Shanghai, none can deny opium pervades the fabric of Chinese society. According to some estimates, by 1923 - China was producing 30 million pounds of opium a year, compared to 2 million for India and 1.15 million in the rest of the Near East. For example - 90% of adult male addicts in Yunnan, with many babies born as addicts, have acquired their habits in the wombs of addicted mothers. Some idealistic dreamers look onto the Kuomintang’s National Revolution as a possibility that the vice will be stamped out, that with the end of Chinese warlordism will come the suppression of this scrooge of a plant.\n\nNonetheless, the Nationalists under the leadership of [GXC.GetLeader] are pragmatic in need for military finance. Since 1923, Sun Yat-sen had established a precedent by licensing brothels and opium dens for national revolution. Likewise, while the Generalissimo [GXC.GetLeader] has declared that opium is to be suppressed; it is essentially a cover for the fact that the Party controls the opium supply.\n\nAs such, the Nationalists in Guangzhou have found an ally in organised crime across the Legation Cities, such as the Green Gangs. These triads, while nominally “apolitical” nonetheless see the Nationalist government as the best force to stamp out radical leftists and the warlords. At the same time, they are also more than willing to play a part in the Nationalists’ monopoly of narcotics. With the collapse of the short-lived leftist Kuomintang government, some of these “Shanghai men” have offered their services to [GXC.GetNameDef] - to aid in the greater national revolution."
 lngkmt.60.a: "The money must flow somehow..."

 lngkmt.61.t: "The Whampoa Class of [GetYear]"
 lngkmt.61.d: "“You will carry on the ideals of the revolutionary martyrs, laying down your lives and shedding your blood, making the foundation of the Chinese Republic secure, causing the Sanminchuyi to be manifested in a practical way; and then the revolution will be proclaimed loudly, like France’s.,.if the revolution is not finished, China shall die, and a race of 400,000,000 will become extinct. The death of our country and the extinction of our race are dependant on the life and death of you gentleman... Therefore, we definitely must open this school, and we must make a revolutionary army of men who will save the country and the people.”\n\nThese were the words of our beloved and esteemed eternal premier to the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. Once more, the academy doors were reopened after years of inactivity, and a new commencement ceremony was dedicated to a new class of Whampoa, [GXC.GetLeader] spoke these words with fiery passion and intensity - mirroring the frustration of the Kuomintang organisation. With the collapse of the NRA during the Northern Expedition, the KMT had been associated with nothing but failure. With this new class of ideologically motivated soldiers willing to shed blood for their nation, perhaps there is a chance - that the flame of revolution has not yet been snuffed out."
 lngkmt.61.a: "We'll finish what they started."

 lngkmt.62.t: "Propaganda to the People"
 lngkmt.62.d: "Article 11: The activities of radio broadcasting stations should be limited to the following :\n1. Speeches of public interest.\n2. News and reports on the market situation and meteorology.\n3. Music, songs, and other entertainment programmes.\n4. Commercial advertisements but these should not exceed one-tenth of all broadcasting time.\n\nArticle 12: Radio broadcasting stations must not broadcast anything that violates Party principles, damages public order, and offends decency; violators will be prosecuted in the countries.\n\nWith these new party guidelines, the Ministry of Communications has been established today in [GXC.GetNameDef]. In radio broadcasting and newspaper media, the Ministry of Communications is working on a means to create a new medium for unifying the country and to “civilise” the masses - consistent with their efforts to unite the country linguistically and culturally under the KMT’s hegemony. To spread the ideals of the Three Principles of the People and to encourage the masses to partake in the Kuomintang’s revolution, the Party has formally commissioned a Party newspaper (The Minguo Ribao) and a Party broadcasting station (Zhongguo Zhongyang Wuxian Gunagbo Diantai - China Central Radio Broadcasting Station or CCBS)."
 lngkmt.62.a: "The people will hear and they will know."

 lngkmt.63.t: "Song Ziwen's Economic Principles"
 lngkmt.63.d: "In a brazen declaration, Song Tziwen declared today in a speech that the military phase of the revolution was over and that the government should turn to reconstruction. The Harvard-educated economist has strong ties as the brother of Song Qingling and had been recruited by Sun Yat-sen to finance the Guangdong Government.\n\nHe has created three points to reform and rebuild China's economy from the provincial Kuomintang government to a truly national Republic of China. The first was the establishment of a National Budget Commission to cooperate with the Ministry of Finance to set up a budget system. The Commission was tasked with both deciding and controlling government expenditures. Much to the annoyance of military leaders in the NRA and Generalissimo [GXC.GetLeader], he has also called for the demobilisation of the military and cuts in military expenditures. Finally, he has called for a comprehensive currency reform - the replacement of the imperial tael with the yuan, a central bank, and a central mint.\n\nAs a civilian leader of the Kuomintang, Song’s proposal represents a new opposition movement against the Kuomintang’s military leadership. He has repeatedly emphasised the need to reduce military spending in favour of government development for the country, in his views, only a healthy national economy can produce a reliable tax base and provide the government with the funds for reconstruction."
 lngkmt.63.a: "Let's get to work."

 lngkmt.64.t: "Future of the National Revolution"
 lngkmt.64.d: "With the revolution secured on the Chinese mainland and the national unification at last, there are certainly questions as to the future direction of the Kuomintang. While domestic issues are being addressed as part of the National Reconstruction, there are also many who share in the idea that China’s place is not merely to be confined to the Middle Country, but rather to extend her influence across the Pacific.\n\nAfter all, are we not the sons of Yan and Huang, destined to rule and lead East Asia? Has it not been China for centuries that was the epitome of a cultural and political hegemon, practising not what some may denounce as imperialism but rather a sense of cultural hegemony due to the innate superiority of Chinese civilisation. Across Asia, there are plenty of peoples and nations that lie oppressed under the boot of imperialism. Under the revived Republic of China, will there be peace, sovereignty, and tranquillity across Asia - no more shall the people cry out in desperation; we will help them realise the Three Principles’ of the People."
 lngkmt.64.a: "We will maintain the peace of the world."

 lngkmt.65.t: "Goals of the New Life Movement"
 lngkmt.65.d: "Despite the success of the unification wars and the national reunification, the National Revolution still remains...unfinished. The Chinese people are, as a whole; lazy, selfish, undisciplined, and dissolute. From the opium addict to the prostitute, our society is in need of great reform.\n\nTo guide the people and to lead them to become true national citizens, we must re-introduce to our nation the four great values: Li (natural rites), Yi (the righteousness of justice), Lian (honesty or cleanliness), and Chi (the notion of right and wrong). These are Confucian values but surely it is impossible to have people know the 96 rules of people’s daily behavior. This is Confucianism for the masses, stripped to its bare ethical essentials - if we are to have a new life that accords with the four values, then we must talk less about avenging national humiliation and first about how to wash our faces in clean water.\n\nWhen society achieves a state of obedience, sacrifice, strictness, and cleanliness - then we will be able to come together and bravely sacrifice everything for the nation. What is, therefore the goal of this movement? Simply put, it is to thoroughly militarise the lives of the citizens of the entire nation so that they can cultivate courage and swiftness, endure suffering and hard work - most of all, they must be prepared to sacrifice everything for the nation."
 lngkmt.65.a: "And time will tell whether or not we were right..."

 lngkmt.66.t: "Lectures from the Political Department"
 lngkmt.66.d: "As the National Revolutionary Army grows in size and strength, the soldiers of the NRA are instructed to attend their lectures. These lectures are handpicked from the Political Department to inspire the soldiers to become the new revolutionary army of China. Below are some of the following lectures and lessons that the new cadets are encouraged to attend to:\n\nHumanity and Self Restraint are the Most Important Virtues for Military Men\n\nIn Order to be a Member of the Revolutionary Party One Must First Understand the Value of Human Life\n\nMilitary Life as a Foundation for Spiritual Unification\n\nHygiene Is a Most Crucial Elements in a Military Organisation\n\nSoldiers, Members, and Officials of the Party Should Obey Its Orders Absolutely and Not Just Do as They Please\n\nThe Principle of National Salvation Through Unification."

 lngkmt.66.b: "I want to attend a KMT lecture!"

 lngkmt.67.t: "The Lecture Begins"
 lngkmt.67.d: "Gathered together in a hurdle of soldiers from places as far apart as Hunan and Yunnan, the new cadets listened to their political commissar as the young officer bellowed out in fluent putonghua the political commands:\n\"Comrades, Recite the Ten Commandments of the Revolutionary Army!\"\n\nThe cadets of the National Revolutionary Army are consistently fed with revolutionary ideals of political indoctrination from their superiors and officers. All soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army are told to memorise and recite the following principles:\n\nDo Not Fear Death\n\nDo Not Covet Wealth\n\nBe Willing to Work Hard\n\nTake Pride in a Good Reputation\n\nAccept Discipline and Have a Firm Faith in the Three People’s Principles\n\nBe Willing to Relinquish Personal Opinions\n\nLove the Common People\n\nBe Devoted to Duty\n\nBe one in Spirit\n\nStick with your assignments until completed."
 lngkmt.67.a: "Back to the battlefield we go."
 lngkmt.67.b: "I want to hear more!"

 lngkmt.68.t: "Catechisms of the KMT"
 lngkmt.68.d: "The soldiers were then quizzed by their commissar on the catechisms of the NRA. These catechisms are recited daily by NRA soldiers in order to maintain their discipline and their ideological stance towards the Party.\n\n\"Comrades, why should there be a National Revolution?\"\n\n\"Because we feel oppressed by the foreigners.\"\n\n\"What are the Principles with which to save the people?\"\n\n\"The Three Principles of the People.\"\n\n\"Can we actually put them into practice?\"\n\n\"We must do our best.\"\n\n\"What is the symbol of our principle?\"\n\n\"The Party Flag.\"\n\n\"With what have paid for this flag?\"\n\n\"With the lives of our martyrs.\"\n\n\"Do you know your enemies?\"\n\n\"Yes, my enemies are the traitors and the foreign powers.\"\n\n\"How can your humiliation be avenged?\"\n\n\"Only in the hard struggle of the revolution.\""
 lngkmt.68.a: "Through blood and sacrifice, we will unite China."

 lngkmt.69.t: "The Ministry of Education"
 lngkmt.69.d: "Inspired by his visit and observance of the French educational system, the Chinese educator Cai Yuanpai had plans to design an elaborate and modern education system for the masses of China in accordance with the Three Principles of the People. In a 1922 proposal, Cai recommended that the Chinese government establish university districts where chancellors of these universities would work together to form a Council of Higher Education - who could discuss concerns without fears of government interference. His goal was a unified, strong higher education, free from the influence of the government.\n\nDuring the Guangzhou Nationalist Government, the Party established a Central Educational Council to concern itself with educational matters. With the fatal collapse of the Kuomintang’s leftist faction, leftist intellectuals like Cai have nervously re-entered the political sphere with Generalissimo [GXC.GetLeader] welcoming the educator to partake in a new Central Educational Council. Cai, nonetheless, has attempted to set up his own University Council.\n\nNonetheless, in a near-unanimous vote held in the Central Committee, the Nationalist Government officially voted to abolish the University of Council and replace it with a Ministry of Education as the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen intended. Furthermore, the Nationalist Government has also endorsed the Party’s propaganda department to partake in the education of society."

POLITICS_YUNNAN_BAI_CHONGXI_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gMarch 18th, 1893, in Guilin, Guangxi, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gA Muslim man of the Hui people, Bai Chongxi claims descent from a family of Persian merchants who settled in Sichuan. He attended the Guangxi Military Cadre Training School under a ground-breaking modernised curriculum as part of wider reforms within the Chinese military. This cutting edge knowledge would serve him well when he made a name for himself serving in a Guangxi student militia, later climbing the ranks to become one of the most influential generals in the Warlord Era. A loyal supporter of Sun Yat-sen's vision for a democratic China, he was part of the triumvirate known as the New Guangxi Clique, which sought to overthrow Lu Rongting's regional warlord government. Unfortunately, the collapse of the Northern Expedition and the German intervention in China would lead to the New Guangxi Clique snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, fleeing in exile alongside many other Kuomintang members to Yunnan. Since then, he has worked to train a new generation of officers, passing down the book smarts he learned in Guangxi, and the bitter lessons the Northern Expedition has taught him.§!"
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LI_ZONGREN_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gAugust 13th, 1891, in Guilin, Guangxi, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gLi Zongren is one of the National Revolutionary Army's most competent and skilled military leader. He was a member of the Tongmenghui at a young age despite understanding little about Sun Yat-sen's vision for China initially. Educated by Cai E, he quickly rose through the ranks under the Guangxi Clique and he would personally rise to prominence through Yunnan's invasion of Guangxi in 1923. Gathering a significant force as Yunnan retreated, he aligned himself with the KMT forces and established the New Guangxi Clique after evicting the Old Clique from the province.\nDuring the Northern Expedition, Li’s skilled leadership of the Nationalist Seventh Army earned it the moniker of \"Army of Steel\", being one of the few NRA commanders to have defeated Wu Peifu on the field. However, the Expedition failed, and Li was forced to retreat to Guangxi, where he would be dislodged by a combined Old Guangxi-Guangdong force aligned with the Zhili Clique. The New Guangxi Clique then fled to Yunnan, protected by Tang Jiyao in order to safeguard his province's autonomy.\nAfter his defeat, Li Zongren focused on rebuilding his forces and consolidating, rapidly becoming the informal leader of the KMT's right-wing. From there, he plotted to invade Guangxi when the opportunity would present itself and re-establish a Nationalist presence in Southern China. That is, one not tainted by Wang Jingwei's French-dependent Central Committee and would truly reunite China first instead of \"playing revolutionary\" from a comfortable exile.§!"

POLITICS_GXC_CHEN_CE_NAVY_DESC: "§YAdmiral Description\nBorn:§! §g1893, in Wenchang, Guangdong, Qing Empire§!\n§YNaval Career:§! §gKnown in the Anglophone world as Andrew Chan Chak, Chen Ce graduated from the Huangpu Naval Academy, leading fellow naval officers against Yuan Shikai and supporting Sun Yat-sen, lobbying Chen Jiongming to allow Sun to return to Guangdong in 1917. In the June 16 Incident of 1922, Chen Ce sided with Sun Yat-sen, his marines instrumental in resisting Chen Jiongming's attack while his ships saved Sun and forced the rebels out of Guangzhou. Chen Ce would become commander of the Guangdong Fleet as a result. During the Northern Expedition, he bravely led the defence of the old fortress of Humen Island, which guarded the sea entrance to Guangzhou, against the German Expedition. This would cost him his left leg, but his personal bravery ensured he wouldn't be purged during Chen Jiongming's return. Ever since then, Chen Ce has fought to maintain the Guangdong Fleet's independence from the Army despite its insignificant size. His actions during the July Incident and the German Intervention cemented his reputation as a skilled and brave naval and marine commander.§!"
POLITICS_GXC_MA_JI_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §g1888, in Baise, Guangxi, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gMa Ji is the head of the Guangxi Clique following Lu Rongting's senescence. As the younger adopted son of Lu, his views and attitudes were heavily influenced by his adoptive father. He valued maintaining the Clique's image as a pluralist military entity that was fixated on maintaining Guangxi's independence.\nWhen Lu Rongting became governor of Guangxi during the Xinhai Revolution, Ma was his deputy, and the two would be involved in the National Protection Movement that overthrew Yuan Shikai's regime.\nAfter a brief war with Yunnan, Lu's Guangxi Clique was evicted from the province by the KMT-aligned New Guangxi Clique. While Lu retreated to Hong Kong and allied with Chen Jiongming, Ma Ji, who was in Hunan at the time, went north and joined forces with Wu Peifu's Zhili Clique. By the time of the KMT's failed Northern Expedition, he was leading the Fifteenth Army against the KMT. He scored a victory against the retreating Nationalists' Seventh Army, which was also composed of soldiers from Guangxi. He would later convince them to stand down, declaring that \"Guangxi people do not fight Guangxi people\".\nSince the Northern Expedition, Ma Ji rejoined Lu Rongting after his restoration to the Guangxi provincial government. From there, he led the provincial army's modernisation plan, giving him ample influence and experience in managing the Clique's affairs. He remains devoted to the province and its people, strongly promoting regionalism and Lu Rongting's pluralist legacy.§!"
POLITICS_GXC_CHEN_JITANG_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gFebruary 12th, 1890, in Fangchenggang, Guangdong, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gChen Jitang joined Sun Yat-sen's movement in 1908 while he was in the Qing Army. He would be an officer during the Anti-Monarchy War, Constitutional Protection War, and Guangdong-Guangxi War under Chen Jiongming. During the June 16 incident, he would side with Sun Yat-sen, participating in a mutiny orchestrated by Li Jishen. Despite considering himself a \"staunch follower of Sun Yat-sen\", Chen was critical of the presence of Russian and French advisors, and Sun's pro-Internationale foreign policy, putting him firmly in Hu Hanmin's right-wing of the Kuomintang. He would stay in Guangdong during the Northern Expedition, fighting off the remnants of Chen Jiongming's Guangdong Army before making a desperate attempt to stop the German Expedition as part of the Fourth \"Iron\" Army. Hu Hanmin's purge by Chiang Kai-shek put Chen in an awkward position within the party, and when the Northern Expedition failed, he disavowed Wang Jingwei's leadership of the KMT and followed Chen Mingshu back to Guangzhou, now back in Chen Jiongming's control.\nDespite having opposed Chen Jiongming, Chen Jitang soon came into conflict with Chen Mingshu because of his progressive platform and alignment with the KMT's left-wing. Instead, he was won over by his former enemy's economic policy and sensible leadership, which saw increasing prosperity for his beloved Guangdong. With amends made with his former enemy, Chen Jitang was heavily involved in rebuilding the Guangzhou Military Academy with Whampoa destroyed, firmly committed to improving education in both the Army and the province.§!"

After the June 16th Incident, Yang was ordered by Chen Jiongming and Ye Ju to defend Huizhou. It appeared at first that Yang had defected to Sun Yat-sen, but this turned out to be a ruse and soon the NRA was marching against Yang and the 9th Division of the Guangdong Army. For four months, Yang held out in Huizhou until the NRA forces were finally exhausted and forced to give up the attack. Over the next two years, Yang defended his position against the KMT, even pretending to join them and double-crossing a second time. But the defence could not last forever and in October 1925 Chiang Kai-shek finally breached the gates of Huizhou. Yang was forced to retreat to Hong Kong along with the rest of Chen’s followers.

Although he enrolled in the Baoding Military Academy in 1912, Chen left the following year to join Sun Yat-sen's ill-fated second revolution. As a commander in the National Revolutionary Army, Chen Mingshu led his troops to defeat Chen Jiongming's rebellion in Eastern Guangdong and to dislodge anti Kuomintang warlords in Guangxi and Yunnan.\n\nDuring the Northern Expedition, Chen Mingshu led the 10th Division of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, defeating Wu Peifu in a joint operation led by Li Zongren. Despite its initial success, disaster soon struck the Kuomintang as the German Empire directly intervened against the Guangzhou Nationalist Government. Chen Mingshu found himself retreating back to Guangdong where Chen Jiongming had reestablished his control of Guangzhou in the wake of the Kuomintang collapse.\n\nDespite being an enemy of the Kuomintang, Chen Jiongming gave refuge to Chen Mingshu as he needed capable allies to help strengthen his new regime. Under Chen Jiongming's protection, Chen Mingshu established the Productive People's Party as a front for Kuomintang remnants in Guangdong to rally behind.

He was merely an upstart member of the Provincial Assembly, having only been part of an aborted attempt at an uprising before the Xinhai Revolution. When Guangdong declared its independence in October 1911, Chen was elected the commander-in-chief of its forces, the Xunjun, an army of defected army officers, peasants, and revolutionaries. He would lead this revolutionary army and free Guangdong, forcing the Governor-General to flee Guangzhou before joining up with Sun Yat-sen's forces. Under Sun, Chen was known as cautious, perhaps overly so, but competent. When Sun returned in 1917, Chen would be the one to drive Guangxi forces out of Guangdong in a couple of months when Sun split with Lu Rongting. Chen repeatedly advised caution over the Northern Expedition, which, along with intrigue from other Kuomintang officers, further drove Sun and Chen apart until they split in June 1922. In 1925, Chen would return to lead the Guangdong Army against the KMT, but would be defeated and forced into exile. The Kuomintang was then defeated by the Zhili with German help, making Chen's earlier caution rather prophetic as he returned to a Guangdong sapped of its wealth. As Governor of Guangdong, Chen maintains his cautious style, preferring not to gamble his armies needlessly, always weary about collateral damage and his people's wellbeing.§!"

After successfully speculating during and after the Shanghai Financial Crisis of 1910, he became one of the most influential businessman in the South.\nThe Xinhai Revolution and the chaotic first years led to poor social and financial security, and the Guangzhou Merchants' Public Safety Organisation, or Merchant Corps, was founded to remedy the situation and Chen would lead it. The Merchant Corps would ensure stability in the city through the Republican era and, later, increasing expropriation and mismanagement from the KMT rebels.\nChen Lianbo's Merchant Corps rose up against the KMT in 1924 in an attempt to overthrow them, but failed, and the remnants would flee to Hong Kong, where they would ally with Chen Jiongming's Federalists to preserve Guangdong's stability and autonomy.\nThe Merchant Corps, after the failure of the Northern Expedition, would work with both the Germans in Guangzhou and Chen Jiongming's provincial government, ensuring a Chinese presence and protection from both German encroachment in the city and increasingly radical reforms in Guangdong. Chen Lianbo himself maintains a great public image by sending a significant portion of his wealth to charity, especially hospitals and schools, and he remains well-respected as a rich philanthropist devoted to ensuring prosperity and stability in Southern China."

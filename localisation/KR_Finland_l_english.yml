### Parties ###
FIN_totalist_party: "SKP"
FIN_totalist_party_long: "Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue\n§LFinnish Communist Party§!\n§gOnce the members of the radical wing of the SDP, the Finnish Communists are well known as the people who were commanding the other side in the Civil War. When they lost, they were forced to flee to Russia, where they founded their own party in exile - only to flee to the French Commune two years later. Similarly to the Russian Communists, the Finnish ones split. Kuusinen and Manner have allied themselves with Bukharin, while Eino Rahja, the Red Guard Commander has aligned himself with Zinoviev. The SKP has remote chances to come to power peacefully. But if the labor people are once again willing to fight for their freedom, there can be little doubt that Rahja and his Red Guard will support the revolt.§!"
FIN_syndicalist_party: "SAK"
FIN_syndicalist_party_long: "Suomen Ammattiyhdistysten Keskusliitto\n§LCentral Federation of Finnish Trade Unions§!\n§gSome might say that the Finnish trade union movement will never rise again. The SAK is now just a shadow of the previous organization, the Professional Association or the SAJ, which was destroyed three years earlier under pressure from far-right radicals. However, the SAK is still legal, and still represents workers' interests as long as the SDP exists. Each day their influence grows stronger, and despite ill condition of the trade unions, due to the anti-syndicalist laws, the working people know that there is an organisation that will help them.§!"
FIN_radical_socialist_party: "SSTP"
FIN_radical_socialist_party_long: "Suomen Sosialistinen Työväenpuolue\n§LSocialist Workers' Party of Finland§!\n§gThe Socialist Workers' Party of Finland was founded in 1920 in Helsinki, as a result of another split in the SDP. Most of the founders of the SSTP had criminal convictions for participation in the Civil War, and the first assembly was dispersed by the police, who detained the participants, some of whom subsequently received prison sentences. When the SKP split over Zinovievite-Bukharinist cause, the majority created a new party - the SSTP, which was even legalized in Finland. The party was able to participate in elections only once - while it received almost 12% of the votes, it was soon banned and its members were imprisoned, including Kullervo Manner - the figurehead of the Finnish communist movement.§!"
FIN_social_democrat_party: "SDP"
FIN_social_democrat_party_long: "Suomen Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue\n§LSocial Democratic Party of Finland§!\n§gOnce notorious for being the losing side of the civil war, the current SDP is far from the communist revolutionary organisation it was in 1918. Under Tanner's wise leadership, the SDP has grown to become the main oppositional party in the country, mostly due to the far-right radical activities against the syndicalists, which made SDP and SDP-controlled trade unions the leading socialist force in the country. While the SDP is not yet ready to accept monarchism, not to mention its syndicalist counterparts, any change in Finland is watched precisely by the SDP members, and they are ready to act.§!"
FIN_social_liberal_party: "ML"
FIN_social_liberal_party_long: "Maalaisliitto\n§LAgrarian League§!\n§gAlong with the SDP and the Progressive Party, the Agrarian League was at first in opposition to the monarchist form of government, but it tried to push for balance and national harmony, accepting the amnesties for the Reds. However, the key factor in the party's postwar history became the concept of Authentic 'Finnishness' and the personality of the Crown-Prince Väinö. In the beginning of the 1930s, many members of the ML participated in the activities of the genuine Finnish AKS and the nationalist Lapuan Movement, accepting the prohibition of syndicalism in Finland. By 1936, the ML became the second party in the country, along with the Kokoomus, that wholeheartedly accepted monarchism.§!"
FIN_market_liberal_party: "Ed."
FIN_market_liberal_party_long: "Kansallinen Edistyspuolue\n§LNational Progressive Party§!\n§gTogether with the SDP, the National Progressive Party remains largely a stronghold of the non-left Republicanism. A liberal party, for almost its entire existence, the Progressive Party was in opposition to the ruling regimes of the Agrarian League or the National Coalition, rejecting any opportunity for cooperation between republican and monarchists until a constitutional agreement is signed. However, in 1933 everything changed, as the Lapua Movement grew stronger and now used extra-parliamentary means of pressure to suppress syndicalism. Under this pressure, some of the Ed. politicians are already actively calling for any compromise against the radicals, even though the party is still looking forward to establishing a republic and allying with the Entente.§!"
FIN_social_conservative_party: "Kok."
FIN_social_conservative_party_long: "Kansallinen Kokoomus\n§LNational Coalition Party§!\n§gThe National Coalition Party was founded as a monarchist pro-German party, in support of Fredrik Kaarle, and since the beginning was thought to be the King's party. Its ideology is built on elements from social conservatism, nationalism and economic liberalism. Even though during the post-independence period, the Kokoomus was often forced to compromise, and, for example, adopt a two-language solution for Finland. However, if the monarchy stays strong, or at least Kokoomus manages to win the majority, they can enforce more conservative decisions.§!"
FIN_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Suojeluskunta"
FIN_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Suojeluskunta\n§LCivil Guard/\"White Guard\"§!\n§gAt first, Suojeluskunta was organized as a voluntary national militia. Although in the beginning of the civil war, the White Guard formed the bulk of the Finnish White Army, the conscript units very soon outnumbered the voluntary White Guards and proved to be crucial for the outcome of the war. After the Civil War, the function of the Suojeluskunta was unclear. By a decree of the Finnish government, in 1918 the White Guard was given a legal basis as private paramilitary organisations. Dividing Finland into districts and local chapters, it acted in every municipality of Finland as an NGO, and due to the policies of Didrik von Essen, the Suojeluskunta's Chief, it remained independent from the Finnish Army.§!"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_FREDRIK_KAARLE_DESC: "Friedrich Karl Landgraf von Hessen-Kassel was elected king of Finland by the Finnish parliament on 9 October 1918 and arrived with his son prince Wolfgang as future crown prince in 1919, presiding over Finland as it was recovering from the War of Independence that ravaged the country in conjunction with the national coalition that has been ruling Finland.\n\nIn more recent years however, the Finnish king of German heritage has increasingly developed into a symbol of German influence in Finland and despite his best attempts, his popularity that had been growing in the wake of reconstructing the country has waned beyond loyalists of the National Coalition."
POLITICS_VAINO_DESC: "If Prince Wolfgang's late father was solemn and distant, his son has done his best to truly integrate into the Finnish high society. He has served in the Finnish army, married a Finnish noblewoman and paid much attention to Finland's economic and cultural life. All this has prepared him to be well-liked king, perhaps capable of truly solidifying Finland as a monarchy."
POLITICS_CARL_GUSTAF_MANNERHEIM_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJune 4th, 1867, in Villnes, Grand Duchy of Finland, Russian Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gThe origin of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim can tell us a lot about how the commander-in-chief of Finnish troops in the War of Independence, the White Marshal, victor and the main face of the White Guard turned out to be a dissident and opposition to the Crown, ending up in exile in neighboring Sweden. In fact, Mannerheim was almost no different from a typical representative of the imperial Russian officers - a noble family, cadet corps, thoroughbred horses and races, and then - heavy service in the \"Russo-Japanese\", and very soon - already Weltkrieg. General Mannerheim differs with most of the generals from the modern Finnish Army in that he fought against them in the Weltkrieg - to then fight alongside them for Finnish independence. Mannerheim was able to form and lead a combat-ready 70,000-strong army. After two months, the Finnish army under Mannerheim's command, with the help of the German corps under leadership of Rüdiger von der Goltz, which had landed in Finland, defeated the Finnish Red Guard units located in southern Finland. However, the victory soon brought Mannerheim disappointment. Mannerheim had initially opposed German intervention on the side of the Whites, hoping to deal with the Reds internally, and upon learning of the agreement with Germany, demanded that German participation be limited and that they obey his orders. Nevertheless, the government entered into a series of bondage treaties with Germany, effectively stripping the country of its sovereignty. When Mannerheim was told that he had to form a new army with the help of German officers, effectively making it subordinate to the Kaiserreich, Mannerheim resigned in outrage and left for Sweden, although he was still held in high regard by the White Guard.§!"

### Events ###
finland.1.t: "The Kingdom of Finland"
finland.1.d: "The collapse of the Russian Empire dramatically changed the situation in what was then known as the Grand Duchy of Finland. On November 15, 1917, Eduskunta, the Finnish Parliament, proclaimed itself the supreme power on the territory of the Grand Duchy. On December 4, the new government of the country, the Senate, under the leadership of Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, which consisted only of conservative representatives, signed the Declaration of Independence of Finland. On December 6, the Finnish Parliament passed an act declaring the independence and sovereignty of the national state of Finland.\n\nIn January 1918, the growing confrontation between the Social Democratic Workers' Executive Committee and the conservative Finnish Senate led to armed clashes between the Finnish Red Guard and the Suojeluskunta (Civil Guard, or the White Guard), which escalated into civil war. Being better organized and receiving German military aid, the Finnish Whites were victorious. On the night of April 26, 1918, the Finnish Red government fled by sea from Viipuri to Petrograd. The Social Democrats managed to maintain their legal status, but the Communist Party of Finland, founded by left-wing radicals in Moscow in August 1918, was banned.\n\nOut of the ashes of the Finnish War of Independence rose Kingdom of Finland, a rabidly anti-socialist nation led by Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, or King Fredrik Kaarle I as he had come to be known following his coronation as King of Finland.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Finnish political life was largely determined by the confrontation, sometimes very violent, between anti-communists, conservatives and nationalists (primarily the National Coalition and the right wing of the Agrarian Union) on the one hand and liberals (the liberal wing of the Agrarian Union, the National Progressive Party and the Swedish People's Party) in alliance with the Social Democrats.\n\nNow, Finland is an authoritarian state with anti-syndicalist laws, and the reputation of the National Coalition is lower and lower each day."
finland.1.a: "Vaikeuksien kautta voittoon."

finland.2.t: "Black Monday Hits Finland!"
finland.2.d: "It seems as though [Root.GetNameDef] has not been able to bypass the economic hardship faced by [GER.GetNameDef] and the other members of Mitteleuropa. With the plummeting of the Berlin Stock Exchange on the 3rd of February, [GER.GetNameDef]’s economy was sent into free-fall, bringing down with it a substantial chunk of the world.\n\nThis economic downturn has hit [Root.GetNameDef] at a very unfortunate time due to problems at home and abroad. It is no secret to many that, despite being an agricultural nation, Finland does not possess much arable land and, thus, struggles to feed its populace by itself. This has left [Root.GetNameDef] in a position whereby it is forced to purchase [UKR.GetAdjective] grain in order to properly sustain its populace and avoid further dissent.\n\nOn top of all this, however, is mounting dissent from the [Root.GetAdjective] people, who have slowly, yet surely, begun to radicalise and call for an end to dependency on the [GER.GetAdjective]s. Black Monday has only granted further legitimacy to radical movements such as the Lapua Movement and the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation have slowly begun to make a comeback, giving the radical groups greater impetus. Demonstrations have already sprung up in many areas. It seems as though the [Root.GetNameDef] is hanging by a thread..."
finland.2.a: "Jumalauta!"

finland.3.t: "Reduced [UKR.GetAdjective] Grain Imports"
finland.3.d: "With [UKR.GetName]’s economy suffering as a result of Black Monday, they have been forced to reduce the amount of grain that they have sent to us thus far. This is most certainly unwelcome news due to our already heavy dependency on grain imports. It seems as though the [Root.GetAdjective] people must tighten their belts and the [Root.GetAdjective] farmers must work harder if we are to make up for the deficit of grain."
finland.3.a: "As if an economic downturn wasn't enough..."

finland.4.t: "Crisis of the 1933 Eduskunta"
finland.4.d: "The current 200-seat Eduskunta, shaped by the aftermath of the 1933 Peasant March of the Lapua Movement, reflects a delicate equilibrium. In the wake of the extraordinary elections, the Social Democratic Party emerged with a significant majority, a trend that has characterized Finnish politics since independence. However, the SDP's recurrent electoral victories have not translated into stable governance. Instead, minority governments, predominantly led by either the National Coalition or the Agrarian League, have become the norm. The conservative sway in the current Eduskunta took shape as a response to the rising influence of the SDP. In the early 1930s, the government, perhaps fearing the ascent of syndicalists and communists, blocked their participation in elections, boosting the SDP's support and parliamentary seats. The 1933 elections further solidified the SDP's dominance, yet the majority remained insufficient to form a coalition government. This dynamic has been a source of contention, particularly among far-right factions like the Lapua Movement. The prospect of losing popular support and, subsequently, the National Coalition's grip on power in the 1937 elections looms large, threatening the conservatives' decade-long rule. Against this backdrop, the unresolved tension between republicans and monarchists adds another layer of complexity. The potential loss of either the Agrarian League or the National Coalition could herald a seismic shift for the Finnish monarchy, intensifying the stakes in the upcoming elections."
finland.4.a: "Interesting."

finland.5.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Federation of Trade Unions Protests!"
finland.5.d: "Having been locked up by the government in Suomenlinna following his role in leading the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation during the [Root.GetAdjective] War of Independence, Kullervo Manner has been a controversial figure to many within [Root.GetNameDef]. A substantial minority within the SDP and the socialists that have been forced underground by the government wish to see Manner freed, while some of the more moderate liberals in [Root.GetNameDef] oppose his conviction on the grounds of impartially by the Supreme Treason Court.\n\nIn any case, it comes as a surprise to many that the socialists who had been largely eradicated and forced underground have finally come out of hiding to protest and petition for Manner’s, who is still considered the de jure chairman of the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation, release. Many of the more rabidly anti-socialist politicians have begun cursing the name of the syndicalists for sabotaging the current financial instability within [Root.GetNameDef] for mere political opportunism."
finland.5.a: "We'll crush those traitors once more!"

finland.6.t: "The Red Guard and the Lapua Movement Clash!"
finland.6.d: "Terrible news has arrived from Viipuri! Apparently, it seems as though the Lapua Movement had decided to take matters into their hands and, following the news of the resurgence of the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation, have decided to hunt down any remaining syndicalists in the hopes of rooting them out. It seems as though the hunt did not go as planned, however, as the Red Guard, who appear to be working with the People’s Delegation, made an appearance.\n\nReports have described the violent fighting that broke out between the two groups, with the clash proving to be inconclusive as neither side was able to gain the upper hand. Eventually, however, the fighting died down.\n\nKing [Root.GetLeader] and the National Coalition have been very worried about the ongoing events as they have only served to further sow the seeds of dissent within the [Root.GetAdjective] population while also destabilising [Root.GetNameDef]."
finland.6.a: "We must bring back order at once!"

finland.7.t: "King [Root.GetLeader] Makes a Decision"
finland.7.d: "Turning his attention towards recent events, most worryingly the various clashes between the Lapua Movement and the Red Guard, King [Root.GetLeader] has been deliberating with regards to allowing the Etsivä Keskuspoliisi to take a more active role in pacifying the radicals, so as to set a precedent that dissent will no longer be tolerated.\n\nMany of the hardline anti-socialists within the King’s cabinet have advocated for doing so, stating that a precedent of intervention on behalf of the government is important, alongside the strengthening of the state police, lest the clashes spiral out of control into a full on revolt. On the other hand, however, moderate conservatives within the National Coalition, alongside the social democrats, have advocated for letting the situation be and have made the point that dissent within [Root.GetNameDef] is already high enough and that any government intervention could lead to ordinary citizens joining in on taking radical action. It is clear, however, that the King must make a choice, and fast, lest the current window of opportunity escape."

Most notably, he called upon the [Root.GetAdjective] people to come together in order to ensure the stability of [Root.GetNameDef] and reject the radicalism of the far-left and far-right.\n\nJoining him were members from the National Coalition, most notably members from the more hardline anti-socialist wing of the party.

finland.9.t: "SAK Calls for the General Strike"
finland.9.d: "As Finland grapples with the lingering aftermath of the Black Monday crisis, the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions has issued a rallying cry — a call for a general strike. The genesis of this unrest can be traced back to February, the month that left the Finnish economy battered and bruised. The pervasive strikes, an indomitable force since Black Monday, have evolved beyond a mere expression of economic grievances. Seizing the opportunity presented by the prevailing instability, the workers, in a unified voice, demand not only better wages and improved working conditions but a fundamental shift in the power dynamics that have long favored the employers. Kulervo Manner, having languished in prison since 1932, a fact that has only added fuel to the flames of discontent. The workers, in their quest for justice and solidarity, demand the release of Manner, seeing him not just as a political leader but as a symbol of their struggle against what they perceive as an oppressive system. The call for a general strike echoes with the collective frustration of a workforce. The government now faces a formidable challenge in quelling a restive workforce and addressing the multifaceted demands."

finland.10.t: "The SDP's Choice"
finland.10.d: "Väinö Tanner, the leader of SDP, has been called for action by the trade unions. In reflecting on the party's historical journey, there's a stark contrast between the revolutionary fervor of 1917 and the pragmatic compromises made in the post-Vapaussota era. In the tumultuous days of 1917, the SDP, radicalized by the apparent futility of achieving its reformist goals through parliamentary channels, embraced revolutionary methods. The culmination of this radicalization was a general strike that reverberated from the 14th to the 20th of November 1917. Through the power of collective action, the SDP successfully secured landmark victories, including the implementation of an 8-hour working day and municipal suffrage. However, the defeat of the left wing in the subsequent War of Independence brought about a seismic shift in the party's ideology. The SDP, in a bid for national unity and peace, outlined its new direction in the Declaration for Finnish Labor. Revolutionary methods were discarded in favor of a more measured and pragmatic approach.\n\nNow, as the SDP faces the prospect of supporting the general strike, the echoes of its revolutionary past and the pragmatism of its present collide. The party stands as the largest in the Eduskunta, but have never led a government. Yet, the rise of far-right activities and a government seemingly unresponsive to the needs of the working class pose a challenge to this conciliatory stance."

finland.11.d: "On the momentous occasion of the 10-year anniversary of Yleisradio, Prime Minister Pehr Evind Svinhufvud addresses the nation through a special radio broadcast. Svinhufvud begins his speech with gratitude, acknowledging the role that Yleisradio has played in connecting the diverse regions of Finland. He highlights the historical significance of September 9, 1926, when Yleisradio broadcast its first program from the studio at Unioninkatu 20, a day now considered Yleisradio's birthday.\n\nThe Prime Minister delves into the early challenges and successes of Yleisradio. In its initial years, broadcasts were confined to the Helsinki area, but by 1928, the reach expanded, making Yleisradio accessible throughout the country. Svinhufvud notes the remarkable development of a nationwide network, enabling 100,000 Finnish homes to enjoy broadcasts by the 1930s. In 1934, a significant turning point occurred as Yleisradio transitioned to state ownership. Svinhufvud underscores the importance of this shift, aligning the broadcaster more closely with national interests. The Prime Minister acknowledges the pivotal role Yleisradio played in bringing the nation together during challenging times, fostering a sense of unity and identity. Svinhufvud extols the virtues of Yleisradio in disseminating information, fostering education, and enriching Finnish culture. He emphasizes the broadcaster's commitment to unbiased news, cultural promotion, and the support of local artists. The Prime Minister recognizes Yleisradio's role not just as an entertainment source but as a vital component of everyday life for many Finns. In his closing remarks, Prime Minister Svinhufvud emphasizes the need for unity and solidarity among the Finnish people.

Väinö Tanner, the party leader, stands before a nation in turmoil and declares that the SDP will not be a passive observer but an active participant in the call for change. Widespread strikes and protests grip the nation, bringing economic activities to a grinding halt. Factories fall silent and streets echo with the chants of protestors. The demands, earlier centered around better wages and improved working conditions, have evolved. The core demand now is: the immediate retirement of the Pehr Evind Svinhufvud's government.\n\nIn a bold move, Väinö Tanner puts forth the SDP's vision for a new Finland. The SDP members of Eduskunta call for the appointment of an interim prime minister, proposing Tanner for the role, to guide the nation through these turbulent times until new elections can be held. The impact is immediate and profound. The paralyzed condition of the economy, coupled with the fervor of the strikes, compels a reevaluation of the political landscape. The question of leadership hangs heavy in the air, and the nation watches as the SDP, now the torchbearer of change, takes center stage."

Tanner, in a bid for transparency and renewal, announces snap elections to be held in the coming months.\n\nCriticism rains down upon the National Coalition, and Svinhufvud personally bears the weight of public discontent.

finland.15.a: "The People's Front has emerged"

finland.16.t: "Desolation in the Countryside"
finland.16.d: "In the quiet landscapes of the Kalajoki Valley, the crisis unfolded like a relentless storm. The frost had taken its toll, but this crisis was different — it struck at the heart of daily life. Money, the lifeblood of transactions, had frozen along with the fields. The usual buyers of milk and bread had become scarce, and in the valleys and villages, there was a silent struggle to make ends meet. Amidst the frostbitten fields, the Finnish peasant faced an additional adversary — the burden of short-term high-interest loans. The current crisis had turned these loans into shackles, tightening around the livelihoods of farmers. As the money stopped flowing, debts mounted, and creditors, unforgiving in their pursuit of repayment, initiated a wave of forced farm auctions. These auctions, once rare, became a hauntingly common occurrence.\n\nThe government, facing the dire reality of destitution in the countryside, deliberated on its response. The Eduskunta minority from the Agrarian League have proposed a debt consolidation legislation. This law aimed to stabilize the precarious financial situation of farmers by converting short-term, high-interest loans into long-term fixed-rate loans. It was seen as a lifeline for those grappling with the sudden halt in economic activity. The National Progressives, while cautious about fiscal measures, have announced their support for this plan, recognizing exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, while the National Coalition may have reservations about increasing government intervention, they might support this plan if it is framed as a market-friendly solution.\n\nImmediately, an alternative path was suggested by the SDP opposition: emergency allocation of funds to ease the burden on those grappling with reduced income. Subsidies could act as a temporary cushion until the economic wheels began to turn again. Additionally, the Swedish People's Party, being sensitive to minority interests, leaned towards supporting subsidies, especially if they included measures to protect vulnerable Swedish-speaking farmers. The National Coalition Party, preferring market-oriented solutions, was skeptical of direct subsidies. They argued for a more market-driven recovery but did not outright dismiss the idea, especially if it was framed as a short-term measure.\n\nWith the two plans suggested, the Eduskunta only lacked the Kokoomus's decision, as their support for either plan will decide its fate."

finland.17.t: "The Demise of Maakuntain Pankki"
finland.17.d: "In the heady days of the late 1920s, the Finnish financial landscape witnessed the meteoric rise of Maakuntain Pankki, a bank that swiftly climbed to become the country's third-largest commercial bank. However, as the economic tempest of the Black Monday Crisis swept over Finland, the recklessness that had fueled its ascent proved to be the very undercurrent dragging it down. Maakuntain Pankki had become synonymous with daring lending practices, particularly the indiscriminate issuance of short-term loans to farmers. In the flush times, these loans appeared as lifelines, fueling agricultural ventures and fostering dreams of prosperity. However, when the tide turned, the loans became anchors, dragging both the bank and the farmers into the deepening economic abyss. As the economic crisis unfolded, the once-mighty Maakuntain Pankki found itself ensnared in a web of bad loans and escalating losses. The figures told a grim tale—losses exceeding 180 million of Finnish markka, a staggering sum that marked the bank's descent into insolvency. With no reprieve in sight, Maakuntain Pankki faced the inevitable — it declared bankruptcy. In a bid to salvage what could be salvaged, the Bank of Finland pressured Maakuntain Pankki to merge with Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), a move seen as a last-ditch effort to prevent a catastrophic financial collapse. KOP, a behemoth in its own right, absorbed all the assets and liabilities of the beleaguered Maakuntain Pankki. While, on paper, the merger might have seemed like a lifeline, KOP's CEO Juho Kusti Paasikivi painted a starkly different picture. He likened the acquisition to inheriting a \"heap of rubbish\", signaling the monumental challenge that lay ahead. The ordinary shares of Maakuntain Bank were exchanged for KOP shares, and the preferred shares met their redemption."
finland.17.a: "That's worrying, to say the least."

finland.18.t: "Rise of the 'Scarcity Movements'"
finland.18.d: "In several regions of Finland people began to organize themselves into certain groups, called the Pulaliikkeet, or 'Scarcity movements', attracting supporters primarily from indebted farmers, many of whom had been associated with Lapua Movement, though reaching left-wing small farmers, cottagers, and ordinary workers in specific districts. The hallmark of the Scarcity Movements is their organized gatherings, where they voiced demands to alleviate economic hardships. Foremost among these demands was a moratorium to suspend foreclosures and payments, aiming to stabilize the debt problems of farms. The movement began with a pivotal meeting in Loimaa, followed by gatherings across the country, culminating in a joint meeting in Helsinki in the end of February.\n\nA distinctive offshoot within the Scarcity Movements is the so-called Provincial Movement (Maakuntain liike), particularly active in the Viipuri region. Founded by farmer Antti Juutilainen, once a member of the Eduskunta from the Agrarian League, this movement deviates from the predominantly Agrarian nature of other scarcity movements. Instead, it is perceived as an offshoot of the Lapua Movement. The Provincial Movement became public with the approval of its right-wing program at a meeting in Ostrobotnia, Helsinki, last week. This program, while addressing the economic concerns of peasants, proposed easing their position by weakening the working population. It suggested amendments to social security and working hours laws, omitting demands like the abolition of foreclosures found in other scarcity movements. Despite differences, the Provincial Movement, Lapua Movement, and the War of Independence Front Soldiers' League (VRL) decided to work \"closely together\". Their collaboration aimed to navigate the complex socio-political landscape while maintaining their distinct identities. Notably, some influential figures from Lapua and VRL participated in the preparation of the Provincial Movement's program. Not all within the Scarcity Movements were in agreement with the Provincial Movement's program. Residents of Ostrobothnia who opposed it left the Maakuntain liike and formed the Kalajoki Valley scarcity movement, declaring themselves as anti-Lapua"

finland.19.t: "Unemployment Crisis Grips Finland"
finland.19.d: "In the wake of the Black Monday crisis, our country finds itself grappling with a severe unemployment crisis. The Social Democratic Party has put forth a plan emphasizing social welfare and public works. Under this plan, significant resources would be directed toward large-scale infrastructure projects, providing immediate employment opportunities. However, the National Coalition and the Agrarian League have jointly proposed another plan: a strategic investment in the agricultural sector. The Swedish People's Party and the Progressives, sensing the merits in both proposals, advocate for a balanced approach. They propose a compromise that integrates elements of social welfare and agricultural investment. The final decision lies on the shoulders of our prime-minister."
finland.19.a: "Push for public works."
finland.19.b: "Our farmers and foresters need the most."
finland.19.c: "While costly, we can do both!"

finland.190.t: "The Horse Rebellion"
finland.190.d: "In the throes of the Black Monday crisis, the economic downturn reached the agrarian heartland, magnifying the plight of rural communities. Nivala, a town in North Ostrobothnia, heavily dependent on dairy and forestry, became a microcosm of the broader rural discontent. The weakened purchasing power of the urban population, exacerbated by export difficulties, cast a shadow over the domestic economy. In agrarian areas, farmers found themselves unable to secure fair prices for their crops. As real interest rates soared in deflationary conditions, rural areas, burdened with debt, faced forced auctions and economic hardship. This gave rise to the so-called scarcity movements, which, in Nivala, would soon evolve into a confrontation with local authorities.\n\nThe conflict in Nivala began with a seemingly routine event — a veterinarian's decision to euthanize a mare belonging to Sigfrid Ruuttunen. The elderly man, disagreeing with the decision, refused to comply. In response, he was sentenced to a 40-day fine, a penalty he chose to serve in the county prison in Oulu. This decision set in motion a series of events that would escalate into a severe conflict.\n\nOn August 10, as Ruuttunen was to be arrested for animal cruelty, a substantial number of Pupäjä residents gathered at the Nivala station to protest. The crowd, disgruntled with what they perceived as arbitrary actions by officials, particularly those involved in expropriations, numbered around 200. They mobbed the rural police chief, Bertil Vahlgren, and other policemen, preventing the arrest. Viewing the situation as a rebellion against official authority, the Oulu police management sought military intervention. A White Guard detachment, led by Captain Nikke Pärmi, arrived from Oulu. Pärmi ordered the crowd to disperse, but when they fortified themselves at the Kuoppala farm, his company marched there. On August 14, they arrested 234 people, singling out 27 as \"rebellion leaders\", meting out punishment. While the severity of the reaction might seem disproportionate, the recent scars in Finnish society, including the War of Independence, Peasants' March, and the Lohja rebellion, are still fresh. The authorities, wary of any resurgence of radicalism, acted decisively to quell what they perceived as a threat to established order."
finland.190.a: "Are they serious?"

finland.191.t: "A Coalition of Discontented Voices"
finland.191.d: "In the wake of rural unrest, discontented farmers, inspired by the scarcity movements and recent events like the Nivala uprising, convened in Seinäjoki on December 20 to establish a new political force —the Pienviljelijäin ja maalaiskansan puolue (the Small Farmers and Peasants' Party or the PMP). The PMP emerged as a synthesis of three previously independent organizations: the Small Farmers' Party of Finland (SPP), the People's Party, and the Central Union of Scarcity Movements. Among these, the SPP, having enjoyed substantial support, became the bedrock upon which the PMP's organizational structure was predominantly built. Eino Yliruusi, the chairman of SPP, was elected to lead the new party, and his followers constituted a majority within the party's governing bodies. The PMP, heavily influenced by the radical rhetoric of scarcity movements, adopted an anti-militarist and anti-German stance, giving the party a distinct leftist imprint in the public eye. The PMP, reflecting the dissatisfaction of a segment of farmers with existing political parties, assumed a largely populist character. The party resonated with the grievances of rural communities, creating a platform for those who felt overlooked or marginalized.\n\nHowever, the radical nature of PMP's rhetoric, coupled with its anti-militarist stance, raised concerns within the government. The fear of leftist ideologies gaining ground and potential ties to broader radical movements prompted discussions about banning the party under the Kingdom Protection Act. However, within the government, opinions diverged on whether to ban the PMP. Some argued that any measures to curb radicalism were necessary for the stability of the state, while others contended that targeting such a small party might be futile and could even amplify its influence."
finland.191.a: "Ban the party, just in case."
finland.191.b: "What next? One-party dictatorship?"

finland.192.t: "A Blow to Populist Voices"
finland.192.d: "Eino Yliruusi, the leader of the previously banned PMP, is promptly arrested. The government's action stifles the party's leadership and fragments its organizational structure. Party members, facing legal consequences, scatter in different directions. In the absence of their preferred political outlet, a significant number of PMP supporters find a new home in the Agrarian League. The League, already championing the cause of farmers, sees an influx of members from the disbanded PMP, enhancing its political influence and broadening its base."
finland.192.a: "ML consolidates its position as the primary representative of farmer interests."

finland.193.t: "A Populist Wave Grows"
finland.193.d: "The recently established party, the PMP, emerges as a potent force in Finnish politics. The party's anti-establishment and farmer-centric rhetoric resonates with a significant portion of the population, especially those dissatisfied with the existing political landscape. The Agrarian League, accustomed to being the primary advocate for farmers, now faces a formidable competitor in the PMP. The League's traditional support base begins to shift, as some farmers find the PMP's message more aligned with their grievances. In the elections, the PMP is projected to secure at least 4-5 seats in the Eduskunta, becoming a vocal representative of rural and populist sentiments."
finland.193.a: "A threat to the ML monopoly!"

finland.21.t: "The Finnish National Elections"
finland.21.d: "The [GetYear] parliamentary elections are now being held in Finland. As it stands, there are three primary contenders challenging for the leadership of [Root.GetName]. The Social Democratic Party of [Root.GetName], who espouse policies in favour of the workers, the Agrarian League, who espouse policies in favour of the farmers, and the National Coalition, who espouse policies in favour of the power of [Root.GetName].\n\nHowever, the social democrats and agrarians have expressed willingness to form a coalition together in order to promote the stability and preservation of democracy within [Root.GetName]. Furthermore, the National Progressives are also have a slight chance to win this year."
finland.21.a: "The Social Democratic Party is victorious!"

finland.22.d: "Formed as a coalition between the Social Democratic Party and the Agrarian League, the Red-Earth government, in order to promote co-operation and stability within [Root.GetName], have successfully, and peacefully, assumed power following a decisive election.\n\nThe name of the government itself is symbolic, for the ‘red’ represents the social democrats while the ‘earth’ represents the agrarians. While many are sure that the coalition will not hold for long and will eventually dissolve, others are remaining optimistic about [Root.GetName]’s political future."
finland.22.a: "We must retain some semblance of hope."

finland.23.t: "Defeating Radicalism"
finland.23.d: "In order to ensure that another fiasco, such as the [Root.GetAdjective] War of Independence and the recent infighting between various factions within [Root.GetName], does not take place, the Red-Earth government has been working tirelessly in order to promote democratic ideals and foster national unity.\n\nWhile the effort is still ongoing, it seems to have borne fruit as the youth of [Root.GetAdjective] seemed less inclined towards the radical politics of some of their elders and have shown strong support for the democratic ideals championed by the government."
finland.23.a: "This will surely ensure for a brighter future!"

finland.24.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Sovereignty"
finland.24.d: "Endorsing and ensuring the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] sovereignty is important. We must not allow for [Root.GetName] to fall under the yoke of imperialist powers. Whether it’d be [GER.GetNameDef] or [RUS.GetNameDef], we cannot allow for the [Root.GetName] people to remain under the oppression of a foreign power any longer. That is why we must foster a sense of patriotism and pride within the [Root.GetAdjective] people and ensure the protection of our great nation for the years to come."
finland.24.a: "Long live [Root.GetName]!"

finland.25.t: "Mending Societal Divisions"
finland.25.d: "Avoiding the fiasco which occurred and had nearly torn apart [Root.GetName] is one of the biggest priorities for the Red-Earth government, with said event still fresh in the minds of the [Root.GetAdjective] people. In order to circumvent this and prevent the mistakes of the past, prominent leaders from within the Red-Earth government have taken to meeting with moderates from both the left and the right and working to bring the [Root.GetAdjective] people together, uniting the nation as one. Whether or not the actions taken by the coalition will work, only time will tell..."

finland.27.t: "The Preservation of the Coalition"
finland.27.d: "Rather than pursuing their own agendas and effectively dissolving the coalition government, which was the expected fate of the Red-Earth government by multiple representatives (even from those within the party as well), the Social Democratic Party and Agrarian League have put aside their differences, willing to put into practice and further the policy of co-operation between [Root.GetName]’s political parties. It seems as though the Red-Earth government is here to remain."

finland.28.a: "We have only done what was necessary."

finland.29.t: "The Election Strategy of the SDP"
finland.29.d: "Once rooted in left-leaning ideologies, the SDP, under the leadership of Väinö Tanner, has undergone a subtle but significant transformation. Shifting towards the right, the party has sought to present itself as a more patriotic force while retaining its commitment to workers' rights, the regulation of capitalism, and a gradual reform agenda. Despite the SDP's potential for a significant share of seats in Eduskunta, the party faces a challenge in securing a coalition that would grant it a majority government. Lingering hesitancy among other parties to collaborate with the SDP puts the party in a precarious position, with the possibility of an anti-socialist coalition forming against them.\n\nThe SDP could opt for a strategy centered around promoting its core policies — workers' rights, economic regulation, and gradual reform. This approach seeks to appeal directly to voters by emphasizing the party's historical commitments. Another avenue is the pursuit of a coalition with the Agrarians. This strategy, referred to as a \"Red Earth government\" involves aligning with the Agrarian League to consolidate political influence. Such a coalition could provide the SDP with the necessary parliamentary support, creating a united front with shared policy goals. Alternatively, the SDP might adopt a more confrontational strategy. By targeting right-wing parties and attempting to diminish their support, the SDP could seek to disrupt the formation of a robust anti-socialist coalition. This approach involves highlighting differences with right-wing policies and appealing to voters who may be on the fence."
finland.29.a: "Focus on bolstering core support."
finland.29.b: "Red Earth government sounds good for Finland."
finland.29.c: "Confront the right - they should not be too strong."

finland.30.t: "The Confederation of [Root.GetAdjective] Trade Unions"
finland.30.d: "In order to allow for labour and unions to more effectively organise in the face of opposition, the Social Democratic Party have seen fit to create the Confederation of [Root.GetAdjective] Trade Unions, containing many of [Root.GetName]’s most notable and powerful unions."
finland.30.a: "Interesting."

finland.31.t: "The Agrarian Strategy"
finland.31.d: "Founded in 1906 by rural Finns, the Agrarian League has, over the years, evolved into a prominent political force primarily representing farmers. The Agrarians' contemporary agenda is multifaceted. It centers on fostering Finnish independence, advocating for the decentralization of political power, and providing steadfast support to the farming community. This unique blend of patriotism, decentralization, and rural focus shapes the party's vision for the future of Finland.\n\nThe Agrarian League can choose a strategy anchored in patriotic monarchism. This involves fostering ties with the National Coalition, emphasizing shared values of patriotism and a loose alignment with monarchy. The aim is to form a coalition that champions the interests of rural regions while contributing to the broader vision of an authentically Finnish state. An alternative approach is to work towards a \"Red-Earth government\" by forming a coalition with the Social Democratic Party. This strategy seeks common ground on rural issues and decentralization, presenting the Agrarians as a bridge between urban and rural concerns. Another avenue is negotiating a centrist coalition with the National Progressive Party. By positioning themselves as a centrist force, the Agrarian League can aim for a broader appeal, finding common ground on issues that resonate beyond their traditional rural base."

finland.31.c: "Strike both left and right!"

finland.32.t: "[SWE.GetAdjective] Rights within [Root.GetNameDef]"
finland.32.d: "One of the big questions on the minds of the [Root.GetAdjective] people and, indeed, the politicians of the Agrarian League is the extent at which [SWE.GetAdjective] rights within our nation must be maintained. While the [SWE.GetAdjective] language is most popular throughout Åland, coastal communities within southern and eastern [Root.GetName] also contain many [SWE.GetAdjective] speakers.\n\nThe question on the minds of the Agrarian League is whether or not the [SWE.GetAdjective] within [Root.GetName] should be limited as much as possible, or whether the current situation should remain as is."
finland.32.a: "The Swedo-Finns are a threat to the [Root.GetAdjective] people."

finland.33.d: "Following the victory of the left forces, Kullervo Manner, who had once led the governing body, has officially been freed after nearly two decades of imprisonment in Suomenlinna.\n\nFerried across the island to the capital, Helsinki, Manner, not missing a beat, gave an impassioned speech to an audience of thousands, who were elated to see their former leader freed once more. Together with Manner, a lot of other 'Red Prisoners' were selected for amnesty, marking a milestone in Finnish history - a period of reconciliation with the political enemies of the past has truly started."
finland.33.a: "A truly joyous occasion!"

finland.34.t: "Denouncing Monarchism"
finland.34.d: "The [Root.GetName] has been under the control of the [GER.GetAdjective]s and their lapdogs for years now, sowing the seeds of discontent and stifling the [Root.GetAdjective] people under the oppressive ideology of monarchism blended with a mix of reactionary thought.\n\nThe state has taken it upon itself to remove monarchist ideals from the nation, though this has displeased our more rural citizens, who are rather conservative in their thought and would prefer a monarch over a syndicalist government."

finland.35.d: "The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, which had once taken a stand against us during the [Root.GetAdjective] War of Independence, has been declared by the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation as an unnecessary institution.\n\nThe Red Guard, who have been given free reign (for the moment) in order to allow us to more easily initiate our directives, have begun purging members of the clergy. Of course, this has not endeared us to many of the more conservative people within [Root.GetName]."

finland.37.t: "Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions"
finland.37.d: "A governmental body comprised of a certain portion of the electorate of the Social Democratic Party, the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation had taken power during the [Root.GetAdjective] War of Independence, believing itself to be the legitimate successor of [Root.GetName]. Led by Kullervo Manner, the Delegation itself was very ambitious in its goals and aimed to empower the labour movement alongside the creation of a new constitution for [Root.GetName].\n\nMany of the Delegation’s members were either purged, imprisoned, or forced underground by the anti-syndicalist National Coalition Party led by the former King Fredrik I. The [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation, forging yet another alliance with Eino Rahja’s Red Guard, vowed to take back power and set [Root.GetName] on its rightful path.\n\nNow in a position of power, the Delegation is prepared to enact its directives, which even includes the complete removal of the dangerous Red Guards, and set [Root.GetName] on a new path..."

finland.38.t: "Weakening the Red Guard"
finland.38.d: "Even before we can attempt to disband the unruly and destructive Red Guard, we must take to weakening them in any way we can. This includes slowly reducing gun shipments, blocking there agenda through legislative means, and setting up prominent leaders within the movement to take the fall. Most importantly, however, we must target their members and, though the use of subtle propaganda, convince them to leave the organisation.\n\nHowever Eino Rahja is a smart man, having been able to avoid capture and execution, unlike Kullervo Manner. We must tread lightly, and hope that the Red Guard does not notice our attempts at weakening them..."

finland.39.t: "Showdown with the Red Guard"
finland.39.d: "By now, all pretenses of any sort of covert operations against the Red Guard have been done away with, following the Red Guard’s discovery of our attempts to weaken them. A showdown between the Delegation and the Red Guard is under way, with the Red Guard quickly approaching in an attempt to storm parliament and declare the creation of a new [Root.GetAdjective] state. We must depend on the people to save us from the radicalism of the Red Guard, and allow for the continuation of a peaceful [Root.GetAdjective] state."

However, we still run the risk of revolutionaries and more hardline members taking over parliament and declaring the creation of a new state. However, due to our propaganda efforts, we should have enough people on our side to resist and completely disband the destructive organisation once and for all."

finland.41.t: "The Question of Capitalist Newspapers"
finland.41.d: "In order to prevent and reverse the current indoctrination of the [Root.GetAdjective] people under the capitalist system, while also building support for the current regime, we must ban all capitalist and/or counter-revolutionary papers. Of course, this will not reflect well on us in the short term due to our willingness, in the eyes of the people, to erode the freedom of press, but it is necessary to ensure the stability of [Root.GetName]."
finland.41.a: "We cannot halt now."

finland.42.t: "Tax Collection"
finland.42.d: "One of the biggest issues on part of the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation, which had also been a prevalent issue throughout the [Root.GetAdjective] War of Independence, was the lack of proper tax collection on behalf of our government. In order to allow for the various functions of the government to run properly and receive sufficient funding, we must enforce tax collection from our citizens. While this will not endear us any further to the [Root.GetAdjective] citizenry, it is something that must be done."

finland.43.t: "The Red Guard"
finland.43.d: "Paramilitary units of the [Root.GetAdjective] labour movement, the Red Guard were initially founded in 1905, and re-established in 1917 following the October Revolution in Russia.\n\nServing as the army of Red Finland, the Red Guards were known to many within Finland to be an aggressive revolutionary army, willing to do anything to push their ideology. This had put them at odds with the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation, who wished to control the increasingly radicalised paramilitary units.\n\nHowever, neither of the sides within the [Root.GetAdjective] War of Independence were able to make a move as, in 1918, the combined White Guard and [GER.GetAdjective] forces were able to defeat the socialists and assume control of the nation.\n\nForced with no other option, those who belonged to the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation and the Red Guard, and who were not arrested, were forced to flee to the then-Bolshevik led Soviet Russia.\n\nAfter the formal surrender by the Bolsheviks in 1920, the Red Guard and the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation were forced to relocate to Finland, hiding underground. Now led by Eino Rahja, the Red Guard forged yet another alliance with the Communists, promising to take power and bring socialism to Finland."
finland.43.a: "We shall bring greatness to Finland!"

finland.44.t: "The Second Red Terror"
finland.44.d: "In order to crush all dissent from opposing figures, political parties, or newspapers, the Red Guard has taken to imprisoning, trying, and executing various counter-revolutionaries and ideological enemies of the state. While this will allow for us to better consolidate our power over the fearful people, who, for now, know not to oppose us, this will have painful ramifications on the functions of the state as many of our leading figures have been removed from power."
finland.44.a: "So be it."

finland.45.t: "Expanding the Bureaucracy"
finland.45.d: "So as to allow for the centralisation of power under the new regime alongside a greater hold on power by the Red Guard, Eino Rahja has seen fit to expand the [Root.GetAdjective] bureaucracy and staff it with civil servants who are willing to carry out the directives of the new government.\n\nWhile this has harmed our standing with the farmers, who would rather see greater representation for rural Finland, this has increased our standing with the urban [Root.GetAdjective] population, who are content with the fact that the government will be receptive to their needs."
finland.45.a: "You win some, you lose some."

finland.46.t: "The Question of Private Assets"
finland.46.d: "It is important that we turn our attention towards the bourgeoisie institutions within [Root.GetNameDef], such as the various banks within the nation, industrial conglomerates, and other profitable financial institutions.\n\nAllowing for the government to properly function while also ensuring that we have money on hand to help carry out our directives is key. Thus, we must take to seizing private assets from the wealthiest individuals."
finland.46.a: "I'm sure they won't mind."

finland.48.t: "The Question of the Military High Command"
finland.48.d: "The question of the military high command has been a very prevalent discussion between various members of the Lapua Movement. As the issue of the remnants of the [GER.GetAdjective] presence in [Root.GetName] and its eventual removal has always been a goal of the Lapua Movement, it is only natural, to many, that members of the military high command who had served in the Royal Prussian 27th Jäger Battalion should be removed from their positions within the military. However, Kurt Martti Wallenius, who himself had been a part of the battalion, is not a supporter of such a purge and argues that getting rid of the military’s best men would only weaken the state of the [Root.GetAdjective] Army.\n\nWith this in mind, the best course of action would be to..."

finland.48.b: "Allow the men to remain in power."

finland.49.t: "Purging Socialists"
finland.49.d: "In order to solidify our control over [Root.GetName] and prevent any dissent against our rule, we must take to purging any and all socialists. We have even gone as far as purging anybody who is sympathetic towards the socialist platform. This has provided us with the stability needed to continue running the nation without further obstacles."
finland.49.a: "Wonderful!"

finland.50.t: "The Role of the Clergy"
finland.50.d: "For the longest time, alongside much of [Root.GetName]’s rural population, the clergymen have been one of the biggest supporters of the Lapua Movement, having spoken out in favour of our cause, thus helping spread it. Many of the more prestigious clergymen have also been apart of a support group of sorts, who have helped fund and proliferate our cause to the masses. We must reward the clergy, and strengthen their role in the new [Root.GetAdjective] state."
finland.50.a: "It is only natural that we expand their role."

finland.51.t: "Abolition of Parliament"
finland.51.d: "Rather than a parliament to lead the [Root.GetAdjective] nation to greatness, what is in fact needed is a strong executive who will work in the interests of both the nation and the people. Political parties and members of parliament are inherently self-serving and cannot save the [Root.GetAdjective] nation from destruction, as seen by the [Root.GetAdjective] War of Independence. We must abolish the parliament at once and swiftly begin to carry out our directives."
finland.51.a: "Such an institution is corrupt to the very core..."

finland.52.t: "[FIN.GetName] Has Remilitarised the Åland Islands!"
finland.52.d: "It seems as though the nationalist [FIN.GetAdjective] has done what we’d feared: namely, the remilitarisation of the Åland Islands. The former government had, with the mediation of [GER.GetNameDef], agreed to respect the rights of the [Root.GetName] citizens in the area. Unfortunately, the Lapua Movement have reneged on that promise, remilitarising the island and silencing any dissent.\n\nWhile many of our more nationalist citizens are clamouring for us to declare war on [FIN.GetName] and take by the islands by military force, moderate politicians argue that we should use diplomacy to take back the islands. What should we do?"
finland.52.a: "Declare war!"
finland.52.b: "Diplomatic pressure would be preferable."

finland.53.t: "[SWE.GetName] Demands the Åland Islands"
finland.53.d: "The [SWE.GetAdjective] government have seen fit to lodge a diplomatic protest with regards to our remilitarisation of the Åland Islands, demanding we return the islands, which are populated by Swedes, and allow for its inhabitants to reunite with their [Root.GetAdjective] brethren."
finland.53.a: "What a laughable proposition."

finland.54.t: "The National Coalition"
finland.54.d: "As the ruling party since the establishment of the Kingdom, the National Coalition has been a steadfast advocate for a monolingualist program, liberal economic reforms and strong anti-socialist stance. The Kokoomus's survival has hinged on a strategic alliance with the Swedish People's Party, a move that required a departure from the party's monolingualist program. This alliance has been crucial in forming minority governments but has come at the cost of diluting the party's traditional stance. The National Coalition's primary strategy is to stay its course and maintain its traditional voter base. Emphasizing continuity and stability, the party aims to appeal to voters who align with its historical commitment to monarchy and conservative values. However, recognizing the potential to bolster monarchist forces, the National Coalition may explore strategies to sway the Agrarian League into a coalition. This involves finding common ground on issues related to patriotism, monarchy, and rural interests. Another approach is to directly confront the republican opposition, particularly the Social Democratic Party and the National Progressive Party. By highlighting differences and emphasizing the risks associated with a grand republican coalition, "
finland.54.a: "We cannot abandon our traditions - focus on core electorate."
finland.54.b: "Negotiate a monarchist coalition with the Agrarians."
finland.54.c: "Strike the republicans!"

finland.55.t: "Monolingualism"
finland.55.d: "One of the big questions on the minds of the [Root.GetAdjective] people and, indeed, the politicians of the National Coalition is the question of what [Root.GetName]’s official language and the issue of monolingualism. While the [SWE.GetAdjective] language is most popular throughout Åland, coastal communities within southern and eastern [Root.GetName] also contain many [SWE.GetAdjective] speakers.\n\nHaving made up their minds, the politicians within the National Coalition have decided to officially opt [Root.GetAdjective] as the official language of [Root.GetName]."
finland.55.a: "This will allow for greater uniformity."

finland.56.t: "The Citizens of Åland React!"
finland.56.d: "The citizens of Åland, having bore the brunt of our new changes, are clearly dissatisfied with the government choosing [Root.GetAdjective] as the sole language of [Root.GetName]. This has, unfortunately, had the side effect of already hurting our already strained relationship with Åland, whose citizens ultimately wish to join [SWE.GetNameDef]."
finland.56.a: "They'll just have to suck it up."

finland.57.t: "The National Coalition"
finland.57.d: "Comprised of hardline anti-syndicalists, theocrats, monarchists, and extreme conservatives, the extreme wing of the National Coalition, led by King [Root.GetLeader], has been in power since the creation of [Root.GetNameDef] and its independence, largely backed by [GER.GetNameDef].\n\nDespite having lost the support of large amounts of the [Root.GetAdjective] populace due to the desire for true freedom, the National Coalition have, once again, managed to prove that they can hold on to power and are free to carry out their directives.\n\nAs it stands, the overarching goal of the National Coalition is to maintain historical and economic ties with [GER.GetName], rally the [Root.GetAdjective] people around the King, act as a conservative bulwark so as to prevent any more political instability within the nation, and work towards rewarding loyal supporters."
finland.57.a: "Interesting..."

finland.58.t: "King [Root.GetLeader] Calls for Unity"
finland.58.d: "Holding an official speech in front of the Parliament House, King [Root.GetLeader], in this time of post-crisis and widespread uncertainty, has chosen to appeal to the [Root.GetAdjective] people, hoping to change their perception of him. Rather than being perceived as a [GER.GetAdjective] puppet, the King wishes to act as a unifier for all Finns, and has done so through an impassioned speech.\n\nTouching upon the recent events and political instability, the King has called for the support of the people and has laid out his plan to make [Root.GetNameDef] a more stable and prosperous place for the [Root.GetAdjective] citizenry, stating that he will do everything in his power to make such a world a reality. And while the speech was not met with roaring applause from the still-hesitant and uncertain [Root.GetAdjective] populace, it has won the King a few supporters and has brought him some time."
finland.58.a: "That's probably the best we could've hoped for..."

finland.59.t: "Expanding the State Police"
finland.59.d: "It is clear that we must take to expanding the role of the State Police, so as to allow the detection of activities deemed as stirring up dissent and, hopefully, end such activities before they can take hold on the nation and gain widespread influence amongst the people.\n\nAs such, King [Root.GetLeader] has seen fit to increase the budget and powers of the State Police while also delegating day to day matters to intelligence ministers within his cabinet. The increase in funding has allowed for the investigation office of the State Police to employ a greater amount of employees while also allowing them to test out new methods to deal with any sort of dissidents and protect [Root.GetNameDef]’s internal security. This has, of course, not been popular with large segments of the population, who view the measure as both excessive and totalitarian..."
finland.59.a: "It is for the greater good."

finland.60.t: "Stabilising [Root.GetName]"
finland.60.d: "Despite having managed to successfully take and consolidate power, for now, it is clear that Mannerheim has much to do with regards to the stability of the nation. While the radicals on both the left and the right no longer pose a credible threat, the [Root.GetAdjective] people remain unsure about the new government and its goals for [Root.GetName].\n\nIn order to clear up most of the uncertainty, Mannerheim has openly stated that his goal is to bring back stability to [Root.GetName] while ensuring both peace and prosperity for the nation."
finland.60.a: "Admirable."

finland.61.t: "The Constitution of [Root.GetName]"
finland.61.d: "Working tirelessly with several former and current government officials, legal and constitutional experts, and members of his inner circle, Mannerheim has been working on the creation for a new [Root.GetAdjective] constitution, so as to lay the foundation for a solid and stable [Root.GetName].\n\nIncluded in the constitution is the strengthening of parliament as the strongest organ of the government, the official abolition of the monarchy, provisions regarding human rights, justice, international relations, and the administration of the nation.\n\nWith so many experts having written the constitution, and the [Root.GetAdjective] people in favour of legitimising [Root.GetName]’s newfound status in the world, it is no surprise that, earlier today, the constitution passed with flying colours, with parliament unanimously ratifying it. It’s effects, however, remain to be seen..."
finland.61.a: "Wonderful!"

finland.62.t: "Unifying the People"
finland.62.d: "So as to not allow our efforts to go to waste, it is key that we bridge the gaps left over by the [Root.GetAdjective] War of Independence alongside coercing the [Root.GetAdjective] people to put aside their ideological differences in order to truly come together and make [Root.GetName] a great and prosperous nation. While the task of doing so is certainly one that requires dedication and compassion, it is clear that Mannerheim embodies those traits and wishes to empower the nation and its people."
finland.62.a: "We must go forth, with our heads held high."

finland.63.t: "[FIN.GetName] Pursues Ties"
finland.63.d: "In order to garner worldwide support for their newfound independence, it seems as though the [FIN.GetAdjective] government under [FIN.GetLeader] has pushed for establishing ties with our nation. Having sent diplomats on behalf of the [FIN.GetAdjective] state and petitioning us to recognise the new government, it seems as though, ultimately, the choice is up to us with regards to how this situation should be approached."
finland.63.a: "We shall formally recognise the [FIN.GetAdjective] state."
finland.63.b: "We shall decline to recognise the [FIN.GetAdjective] state."

finland.64.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed!"
finland.64.d: "Thankfully, [FROM.GetNameDef] has been kind enough to recognise our nation and we have already begun to open up diplomatic channels so as to formally establish ties."
finland.64.a: "Wonderful!"

finland.65.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Declined!"
finland.65.d: "It seems as though [FROM.GetNameDef] has snubbed us, refusing to establish formal ties with our nation, least of all recognise [Root.GetAdjective] statehood."
finland.65.a: "Damn them!"

finland.66.t: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] Requests Arms"
finland.66.d: "[FIN.GetNameDef], having experienced a weapons shortage as of recent, has come to us in an attempt to procure weapons and fill the void created due to years of neglecting the military. Shall we provide them with the necessary arms?"
finland.66.a: "Of course, we have spare equipment lying around."
finland.66.b: "We cannot afford to send any equipment at the moment."

finland.67.t: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed!"
finland.67.d: "The [GER.GetAdjective] have agreed to provide us with the necessary arms to bolster our army, giving the go-ahead to the [GER.GetAdjective] delegation that will promptly be arriving to [Root.GetNameDef] to deliver the weapons. This has helped increase faith in the [GER.GetAdjective]s, thus bolstering relations, while also allowing us to hold off on domestic weapons production for a bit longer."
finland.67.a: "Outstanding!"

finland.68.t: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Has Declined..."
finland.68.d: "The [GER.GetAdjective] have declined to provide us with the necessary arms needed to bolster our military, having cited a weapons shortage as of late. This means that we will need to ramp up domestic weapons production, which will of course take a long time. In addition, this has hurt relations between our nations a bit, as we had placed our faith in the [GER.GetAdjective] people, as our allies, to assist us in our time of need."
finland.68.a: "How dare they!"

finland.69.t: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] Purchases Light Cruisers"
finland.69.d: "In an effort to strengthen their navy, the [FIN.GetAdjective] have purchased two outdated Königsberg-class light cruisers whieh were set to be scrapped for parts or kept as training ships. While useless for the Kaiserliche Marine, they may serve the Finnish navy adquately enough."
finland.69.a: "The ships are outdated anyway."

finland.72.t: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] Contracts Blohm und Voss Designers"
finland.72.d: "In an effort to strengthen their navy, the [FIN.GetAdjective] has contracted German company Blohm und Voss to help Finnish dockyards of Vulcan-Crichton to design more advanced ships. While obviously they are not going to share the most cutting edge technology of Kaiserliche Marine, there is plenty they can do to improve our ally's naval capability regardless."
finland.72.a: "Business is booming."

finland.75.t: "The Restoration of War of Independence-Era Ships"
finland.75.d: "After months of diverting funds, workers, and government support to the restoration of three War of Independence Era ships–namely, the AG-16, Jääkarhu, and the Wäinämöinen–we have finally managed to see the fruition of our efforts. The three ships themselves are nothing to laugh at, especially with their modernisation, and will definitely bolster the [Root.GetAdjective] Navy."
finland.75.a: "Wonderful!"

finland.76.t: "[FIN.GetName] Has Requested to Purchase our Airplanes"
finland.76.d: "It seems that, in order to bolster their air force, the [FIN.GetAdjective] have turned their gaze outward and wish to purchase aircraft from us. While considerations regarding production and the state of our own air force must be considered, it is also true that we could make a good amount of money from the aircraft being sold. What say we?"
finland.76.a: "We shall sell them - what could go wrong?"
finland.76.b: "The costs outweigh the benefits - we shall decline."

finland.77.t: "[SWE.GetName] Has Agreed!"
finland.77.d: "Outstanding news has been received from the [SWE.GetAdjective] delegation: apparently, they’ve agreed to our request and have decided to promptly sell us the aircraft we so desperately need. This will certainly go a long way in bolstering our air force!"
finland.77.a: "Outstanding!"

finland.78.t: "[SWE.GetName] Has Declined..."
finland.78.d: "Terrible news has been received from the [SWE.GetAdjective] delegation: apparently, they’ve declined our request and have decided not to sell us the aircraft we so desperately need. This means we will need to find some other way to bolster our air force."
finland.78.a: "Dammit."

finland.79.t: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] Has Requested to Purchase our Airplanes"
finland.79.d: "It seems that, in order to bolster their air force, the [FIN.GetAdjective] have turned their gaze outward and wish to purchase aircraft from us.

finland.81.a: "Dammit."

finland.83.t: "[FIN.GetName] Has Requested Grain"
finland.83.d: "The [FIN.GetAdjective] government has approached us so as to procure grain shipments, as their old grain supplier, [UKR.GetNameDef] is no longer a viable option for the fledgling nation. While it is true that we posses an abundance of grain, the question of whether or not we even wish to assist the Finns is still one that we must ask ourselves."
finland.83.a: "We shall sell them - what could go wrong?"
finland.83.b: "The costs outweigh the benefits - we shall decline."

finland.84.t: "[RUS.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed!"
finland.84.d: "Good news has arrived from the [RUS.GetAdjective] delegation: apparently they have agreed to supply us with the necessary grain, in exchange for an annual sum to offset the shipment fee, plus a bit extra. Thankfully, it seems we can avoid the starvation of our citizens."
finland.84.a: "Outstanding!"

finland.85.t: "[RUS.GetNameDefCap] Has Declined..."
finland.85.d: "Horrible news has arrived from the [RUS.GetAdjective] delegation: apparently they have have declined to supply us with the necessary grain, citing strained relations between our nations alongside domestic issues. Unfortunately, it seems that our population will have to endure for a certain time until we can find a way to offset the grain crisis."
finland.85.a: "Dammit."

finland.86.t: "Procuring Grain from [UKR.GetNameDef]"
finland.86.d: "With [UKR.GetNameDef] having abruptly cut off grain imports to our nation, the [Root.GetAdjective] people have now been suffering for some time and, despite the reinforcement of power by the King, it seems as though we cannot keep the population satisfied endlessly. We must approach our old partner and ask them for grain imports once more, as they possess an abundance of it, and it is only natural that we should approach them to procure the grain we oh so desire."
finland.86.a: "We shall hope for the best."

finland.87.t: "[FIN.GetName] Has Requested Grain"
finland.87.d: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] has approached us regarding the procurement of grain, due to their lack of the resource. Due to financial constraints by Black Monday, we had originally, to the detriment of the [FIN.GetAdjective], been forced to cut off grain imports, stranding the nation from its primary food source. However, as the crisis has begun to slowly ease, it seems that we can began exporting it once more. Then again, it is also true that conserving grain for [Root.GetAdjective]s at home would also be wise so as to combat any other potential crises. What shall we do?"
finland.87.a: "We shall sell the grain - what could go wrong?"

finland.94.t: "[UKR.GetAdjective] Grain Imports Have Returned to pre-Black Monday Levels!"
finland.94.d: "With the economic downturn that was Black Monday finally having passed both [Root.GetNameDef] and [UKR.GetNameDef], the [UKR.GetAdjective]s have responded to our request and have even affirmed interest in restoring grain export levels to what they were prior to the crisis. This is wonderful news for our nation as it means we can get increased amounts of grain for a lower price, thereby decreasing spending while also boosting morale amongst the [Root.GetAdjective] people."
finland.94.a: "Splendid news!"

finland.95.t: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] Wishes to Improve Relations"
finland.95.d: "In what is considered a surprising move by many of our top diplomats and politicians, [FIN.GetNameDef] has approached us in an attempt to improve relations so as to avoid the outbreak of war in Scandinavia. While reciprocating their efforts may be advantageous and leave us with one less potential front to worry about in the case of war, it is also apparent that we are much stronger than the [FIN.GetAdjective] and can defeat them if need be. That being said, we must send a response as soon as possible. What shall we do?"
finland.95.a: "We will accept their advances... with a few conditions."
finland.95.b: "Accept... but in exchange for a treaty."

finland.96.d: "Our diplomats in [RUS.GetNameDef] have arrived with wonderful news: apparently, the [RUS.GetAdjective]s are willing to accept our offer of fostering peace between our two nations and the warming of relations. However, on a more bittersweet note, they have done so at a cost and have demanded that we hand over Karelia so as to ‘ensure the security of the [RUS.GetAdjective] state’.\n\nWhile it is true that our citizens would be dissatisfied with our cession of the land, it is also true that a hostile Russia is not something we would want on our borders. What shall we do?"

finland.99.t: "Reconciliation With [FIN.GetNameDef]?"
finland.99.d: "In what many consider a surprising move, [FIN.GetNameDef] has, in what may be considered a reconciliatory tone, attempted to foster ties and build relations between our two nations, citing the stability of the Scandinavia as a key reason for fostering ties.

finland.139.d: "In the aftermath of recent instability, caused by outright far-left and far-right protests, the monarchy has been victorious once again; but at a cost. While Svinhufvud proved to be a long-term nation's prime-minister, the times have changed and the National Coalition Party has raised the question of changing the party leadership as well and nominating a new prime-minister to the torn-apart nation.\n\nThe best candidate, therefore, for the majority of the party confederates is the far more moderate Juho Kusti Paasikivi, one of the leading members of the Kok. and a noted Constitutional Monarchist.\n\nThe conservatives in the party, however, want to preserve the status-quo and leave Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, 'the Father of the nation', who signed the declaration of independence and made the Finnish sovreignity real, in his position, though agreeing to some changes in the minister composition."

With a clear reference to the governmental body, created by the SDP during the Finnish War of Independence, the People's Delegation is to become the new democratic socialist parliament of our state, and with the elections to the Trade Unions and Councils began a week ago, the government is ready to announce the results and a new composition of the government."

finland.141.t: "The Left-Wing Opposition Unites"
finland.141.d: "With the national unity policies, implemented by the National Progressives, the leftist Opposition has bursted in protest marches and rallies, outraged by the Edistyspuolue's refusal to grant amnesty to the Finland's socialist leaders currently imprisoned. And the SDP, once again strong and united, as in the early days of the War of Independence, has grown powerful enough to become the forerunner of these rallies and has openly called for the president Ståhlberg to free Kullervo Manner and Oskari Tokoi. Due to the pressure from the opposition, the President has agreed and, by doing so, has prevented further instability. At least for now, as the released Manner has already began active political speeches, calling himslef the political prisoners for ages, and that even though the bourgeoise democracy has 'triumphed' over the reactionary monarchism, they were still blocked in jail. While the police and the government has already warned Manner of consequences for his anti-government speeches, it is unlikely that the SSTP can rally the nation in a revolution. What has happened, however, is less bloody, but nevertheless, critical. The SDP has announced a coalition with the trade union organisation of its former counterpart, Oskari Tokoi, and the new group received the name of People's Democratic Union, already preparing for the next elections and, if our policies fail, they can efficiently take power in their own hands. With the Tokai's nomination to the nation's prime-minister, the SDP is likely to turn its face to the Internationale."

finland.143.t: "Reaction to the Elections"
finland.143.d: "With the SKDL's landslide victory in the recent elections, the liberal parties, such as Maalaisliitto and Edistyspuolue have decided to unite in a liberal centrist coalition against us. This, however, required some reorganisation in both parties and forced them to change their image to the general Finnish public.\n\nSo, the Agrarian League, has changed its name to the Keskusta or Center Party, in order to show their centrist position in the parliament. While still taking inspiration from Agrarianism and Decentralisation, they are now rejecting to form any more Red Earth governments, until SDP dissolves their coalition with syndicalists. On the other hand, the Edistyspuolue has changed its name to the Kansanpuolue, or People's Party, in order to represent their support of all Finnish social strata. While still liberal, they have moved to the right and now represent more liberal-conservative ideas, though still rejecting Kokoomus's authoritarianism."

finland.145.a: "That's a shame."

finland.146.t: "The National Progressive Party"
finland.146.d: "Founded on December 8, 1918, the National Progressive Party finds its roots in the republican majority of the Young Finn Party, with additional members joining from the Finnish Party. This amalgamation of political forces forms the basis of the NPP's political identity, distinctly marked by its unwavering commitment to republicanism. The NPP's republican stance encounters a crucial obstacle—the proposed constitutional reform. The party's recognition of the existing order hinges on the acceptance of this reform, which, if passed, would provide the National Progressives with the flexibility to adjust their republican program. Central to the NPP's platform are national unity policies aimed at improving social conditions. The party's commitment to progressive values underscores its focus on social welfare and inclusivity.\n\nFor the upcoming elections, the National Progressives can explore a centre-left coalition, aligning with parties such as the Social Democratic Party and the Agrarian League. Alternatively, the NPP may opt for an anti-socialist centrist coalition with the Agrarians. A third path involves focusing on lowering the support for the National Coalition. By adopting a strategy that diminishes the backing for the monarchist party, the National Progressives aim to reshape the political landscape in alignment with their republican values."

finland.147.d: "Through the resilience of the Finnish people, our armies have marched across Scandinavia and the Karelian isthmus in a crusade to save our people. With the Finnic Karelians, Kven, and the Sami finally under our protection, we have finally completed our dream of a Greater Finland. Our mission, however, is only partially complete. To the south, the Finnic people of Estonia still lie threatened by foreign powers. Both German and Russian imperialists seek to oppress the Estonian people and destroy their very way of life. Long proposed by numerous Finnish and Estonian intellectuals, the unification of our two nations would help us safeguard our people from foreign imperialism. Taking this idea even further, some of the most radical among us suggest that our Finland take up the the entire Finno-Ugric torch in addition to the Estonian plan, working to unite our disparate people across northern and central Russia along with the northern reaches of Sweden and Norway, and perhaps even as far as Hungary, so that our language and our culture, long eroded by time and foreign forces, can finally heal. What shall we do?"

finland.150.t: "Eemil Setälä Passes Away"
finland.150.d: "Today, the news spreads all over Finland of the passing of Eemil Nestor Setälä, a stalwart figure of the National Coalition Party. Setälä, a devoted monarchist hailing from the Young Finn party, had been a beacon of moderation in the turbulent seas of Finnish politics. Known as the skilled hand behind the eloquence of the 1917 Finnish Independence Declaration, he played a pivotal role in shaping the nation's destiny. However, his influence transcended mere declarations. As a fervent advocate for linguistic diversity, Setälä championed the 1920 language law, standing against the tide of monolingualism that threatened to engulf the Finnish identity. Yet, perhaps his most enduring contribution was his relentless pursuit of a constitutional compromise. Amid the incessant struggle between monarchists and republicans, Setälä stood as a lone voice in the Kokoomus, advocating for a middle ground, a constitutional framework that could bridge the deep-seated divide. Throughout the 1920s, Setälä served as the foreign minister in various coalition governments, navigating the intricate dance of international relations. He later assumed roles as an ambassador to Denmark and Austro-Hungary. In the latter years of his illustrious career, Setälä donned the mantle of the Chancellor of Turku University, bringing his wealth of experience and wisdom to the academic realm.\n\nSetälä's passing has left a void. As the nation mourns, so too does the hope for a compromised constitution dim. Yet, Setälä's vision for democracy and dialogue may yet find its way into the hearts and minds of those who follow, offering a glimmer of hope that the schism between monarchists and republicans will one day yield to the enduring spirit of compromise."
finland.150.a: "With his death, is there any hope for a compromise?"

finland.151.t: "1st May Demonstrations"
finland.151.d: "As the calendar turns to the 1st of May, traditionally a day of workers' solidarity and celebration, the cities of Helsinki and Viipuri are set ablaze with the colors of banners and the fervor of demonstrations. Yet, beneath the surface of this May Day spectacle lies a profound history of struggle and transformation. At the dawn of Finnish independence, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), originally the Finnish Workers Party, stood as a pivotal force. In the tumultuous days leading to the declaration of independence on December 6, 1917, the SDP, advocating for a negotiated independence with Russia, found itself at odds with the bourgeois majority. In the Finnish War of Independence, the SDP-led People's Delegation, aligned with the Red Guards, waged a battle that, despite its loss, left an indelible mark on Finnish politics. Many SDP members who survived fled to Russia, where the Socialist Revolutionary government held sway. The aftermath witnessed a schism within the SDP. Väinö Tanner led the reconstituted party, adopting a reformist stance, breaking away from revolutionary fervor. The Communist wing formed the Socialist Workers' Party of Finland (SSTP), forced to operate underground. Simultaneously, the Finnish Trade Union Federation (SAJ) emerged as a major political player. Instrumental in the November 1917 general strike, SAJ's involvement in the War of Independence on the side of the Reds resulted in thousands of members losing their lives or fleeing to Russia. The aftermath of the war saw the Whites disbanding trade unions, including SAJ. Although later allowed to continue activities, SAJ faced further bans due to the Lapua Movement's Peasant March.\n\nThe turning tide came in October 1930 with the establishment of the Finnish Confederation of Trade Unions (SAK). This marked the resurgence of workers' collective power after years of struggle, job loss, and persecution. By the end of 1934, SAK's membership had burgeoned to 27,000, signaling a rejuvenation of workers' rights amidst a landscape of economic recession and high unemployment. As the May Day demonstrations unfold in 1936, the streets echo with the resilience of the Finnish working class, from the revolutionary days of independence to the emergence of a reinvigorated labor movement, much to the rightist radicals' dissatisfaction."

finland.152.t: "Suojeluskunta Leadership Candidates"
finland.152.d: "The Suojeluskunta stands at a pivotal juncture after the resignation of Didrik von Essen. Three distinguished figures emerge as the primary candidates to take the helm:\n\nCarl Gustaf Mannerheim - The White Marshal: renowned as a war hero and the savior of Finland, Mannerheim's legacy is indelibly etched in the annals of Finnish military history. His popularity among the White Guard is unparalleled, forged in the crucible of the War of Independence where he led anti-communist forces to victory. However, Mannerheim's relationship with the Finnish government has grown strained. His opposition to foreign intervention, particularly the German forces, clashed with the government's decisions. Embittered by these circumstances, Mannerheim resigned as Commander-in-Chief in 1918 and spent years in exile. Now, as a candidate, his return promises change for the White Guard, aligning once more with the hero who led them to triumph.\n\nLauri Malmberg - The Jäger Artillery Commander: a skilled Jäger who fought alongside the Germans during the war, Malmberg's trajectory diverged from Mannerheim's. After the formation of the Jäger Artillery, he assumed leadership roles during crucial operations. Malmberg believes in integrating the White Guards into the Finnish army, foreseeing a future where they operate as an integral part of the nation's defense. His lineage, coupled with his mother's socialist background, brings a unique perspective to the table. Malmberg envisions a departure from the Suojeluskunta's current status as a private non-governmental organization, advocating for a more integrated role within the Finnish army.\n\nAarne Sihvo - The Republican and Former Jäger Leader: a staunch republican and erstwhile member of the National Progressive Party, Sihvo emerged as a leader during the War of Independence. As one of the early members of the Jäger movement, he returned to Finland to train the White Guards. Sihvo's commitment to the Republic and his brief stint in parliament set him apart. Appointed as the director of the War College, his republican stance sparks tension within the general staff. However, Sihvo, though willing to maintain the White Guards as a private entity, aims to elevate its standards to those of the Jägers."

finland.153.t: "6th Anniversary of the Peasant March"
finland.153.d: "As the bells toll in the town of Lapue, it marks the solemn sixth anniversary of the Peasant March, a monumental gathering in 1930, orchestrated by the Lapua Movement, which saw over 12,000 loyalists and supporters marching with military precision to Helsinki. Born out of anti-syndicalist fervor, the movement, led by Vihtori Kosola, aimed to eradicate leftist influence in Finland, a nation still scarred by the echoes of the 1918 War of Independence.\n\nIn its early years, the Lapua Movement exerted tremendous pressure through political terror and violence, employing kidnappings to eliminate perceived threats. Its emergence coincided with a rising leftist tide, challenging the established order. The Peasant March, a display of force, led to the abolishment of syndicalist newspapers, imprisonment of leftist politicians, and the formation of a Lapua-influenced National Coalition government. By the fall of 1930, the Lapuans achieved their goals with the passage of anti-syndicalist laws, suppressing all syndicalist activities. With their primary objectives met, the movement's support for the ruling Svinhufvud government persisted, yet a new adversary emerged: the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the last bastion of socialist resistance against the radical right."

finland.155.t: "General Didrik von Essen Retires!"
finland.155.d: "General Didrik von Essen, the stalwart commander whose life has been intricately woven with the fabric of the nation's defense, officially bids farewell to his illustrious career. Born into a lineage of military nobility, von Essen's journey began in 1886 when he graduated from the Finnish Cadet Corps. His early years were marked by service in the Finnish Dragoon Regiment, stationed in Turku. The disbandment of the regiment in 1901 saw him transition to the Russian cavalry reserve. A pivotal moment in his career emerged in the tumultuous years leading up to the Finnish War of Independence when he commanded the volunteer municipal militia of Helsinki, a gathering of conservative-minded citizens.\n\nVon Essen's pivotal role unfolded in the final stages of the War of Independence, where he commanded a regiment of the White Guard (Suojeluskunta). Subsequent to joining the Finnish Army, he led a Jäger unit before retiring briefly. A return to service, urged by Mannerheim, marked the beginning of his influential tenure as the Commander-in-Chief of the White Guard from February 1919 until this significant day.\n\nInstrumental in crafting the organization's tasks and structure, von Essen steered the Suojeluskunta into a staunchly pro-German force, aligning itself with the National Coalition government and the monarchy. Under his stewardship, the Suojeluskunta became a staunch private non-governmental entity, rather than a part of the national defence, criticized as the Monarchists' private army by the opposition. In 1935, von Essen's contributions were acknowledged with a promotion to major-general, a testament to his dedication and strategic acumen. However, at 72 years old, von Essen now deems it fitting to retire, leaving behind a legacy etched in the annals of Finnish military history.\n\nThe looming question now casts its shadow over the Suojeluskunta: who will inherit the mantle from the departing general? Among the contenders are distinguished figures – Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, an advocate of the defensive doctrine; Lauri Malmberg, an artillery specialist; and Aarne Sihvo, an expert in Jäger tactics."

finland.156.t: "The White Marshal Returns"
finland.156.d: "Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, the indomitable White Marshal, has emerged from the shadows of Swedish exile, returning to the land where he etched his name into the annals of Finnish history. The crucible of the Finnish War of Independence saw Mannerheim as the commander of anti-communist forces, securing victory in the conflict. However, his path diverged from the ruling monarchist and pro-German government. Initially a proponent of defensive strategy, Mannerheim's disagreement with the government's decision to invite German forces soured his relationship. This culminated in his resignation as Commander-in-Chief in 1918, leading to periods of exile in Sweden. Now, Mannerheim returns to Finland. The armed forces, where his name was once synonymous with victory and leadership, react with mixed feelings, as the last 20 years under the command of Paul von Gerich, the army has grown increasingly pro-German and the 'Rysske' general Mannerheim, despite his merit, can be a true alien to some."

finland.158.d: "In February 1929, against the backdrop of simmering discontent and political shifts, the War of Independence Front Soldiers' League (VRL) emerged in Tampere. Founded with the aim of uniting those who fought on the side of the Whites during the War of Independence, the VRL quickly expanded its reach, becoming a prominent force by May of the same year. Led by Jäger Lieutenant Colonel Onni Purhonen as its inaugural chairman, the VRL counted among its founders notable figures such as journalist Eero Rekola, merchant KV Huhtala, and Jäger Captains Arvi Kalsta and Iivari Hyppölä. These individuals, mainly from Tampere, were motivated by a deep disappointment with the post-Vapaussota political landscape and a shared determination to preserve the legacy of the White victory in 1918. The VRL's political program was rooted in opposition to leftist and labor movement activities. Foremost among its objectives was the alteration of election laws to exclude communists entirely from parliamentary and council representation, advocating for increased influence for what they deemed \"patriotic people.\" The union's rules explicitly stated a commitment to \"protect and revive patriotic activities,\" aligning closely with the anti-communist sentiments of the Lapua movement. The VRL's alliance with the Lapua movement was more than ideological; it manifested in practical collaboration. In cities like Tampere, Helsinki, and Turku, VRL's local leaders and active members formed the core of the Lapua movement's strike forces, responsible for various demolitions and acts of political intimidation. Notably, the violent abduction of Deputy Speaker of Parliament Väinö Hakkila in July 1932 was orchestrated by VRL Chairman Eino Haarla, Secretary Eero Rekola, and Board Member Arvi Kalsta. Other instances included the kidnapping of MPs Eino Pekkala and Jalmari Rötkö by Artturi Vuorimaa and the actions led by Eino Laitakari in the Turku region."

finland.159.d: "In the aftermath of the recent political upheaval and the formation of Rudolf Walden's cabinet, the new government swiftly moved to assert its authority and reshape the political landscape of Finland. A pivotal act in this transformative period is the adoption of a government decree that banned all People's Houses across the country. The decree mandated the immediate closure of People's Houses, citing concerns over their alleged role as hotbeds of syndicalist influence. It also granted the government the right to seize associated assets, including properties, funds, and materials deemed contrary to the state's interests. Positioning itself as a decisive measure against what the government termed as syndicalist and Marxist activities, the decree included a public ban on organizations perceived to have affiliations with these ideologies. The move reflected the government's commitment to suppressing perceived threats and was influenced significantly by the Lapua Movement.\n\nThe decree outlined strict enforcement measures, empowering law enforcement agencies to take swift action against any resistance or non-compliance. While receiving strong support from conservative factions, including those sympathetic to the Lapua Movement, the decree faced vehement opposition from left-leaning groups and the SDP. Critics denounced it as an attack on democratic values and an attempt to stifle political dissent. Civil liberties groups raised concerns about the erosion of freedom of assembly and association, viewing the decree as a threat to the Finnish democracy."

finland.160.t: "Formation of the Patriotic People's Party"
finland.160.d: "In the wake of the recent political shifts, a new force emerged on the Finnish political stage — the Patriotic People's Party, known as Isänmaallinen kansanliike (IKL). Despite being led by Vilho Annala, a prominent member of the Lapua Movement, the real person behind the party is nobody other than Vihtori Kosola. The party was strategically formed with the intent to participate in the upcoming elections, aiming to wield influence through parliamentary channels.\n\nIKL's platform is characterized by a fervent nationalism, advocating for the creation of a monolingual Greater Finland. Their vision encompass not only territorial expansion but also a commitment to corporatist economic principles. The party positions itself as a staunch opponent of syndicalism, vowing to eradicate any influence of socialist and Marxist ideologies from the Finnish political landscape. Vilho Annala, with his experience and influence within the Lapua Movement, plays a pivotal role in galvanizing support for the newly formed party. The IKL strategically positions itself to appeal to segments of the population disenchanted with the existing political order, promising a radical departure from the status quo, mainly the wealthy farmers, students, middle-class academics and priests.\n\nNotably, Rudolf Walden emerged as a crucial mediator in the formation of a potential coalition between the National Coalition and the IKL. Recognizing the political landscape's volatility and the need for stability, Walden engaged in behind-the-scenes negotiations to foster collaboration between the two factions. The IKL, while sharing some ideological common ground with the National Coalition, also represented a more radical and populist element within Finnish politics."

finland.161.t: "Crackdown on Marxist Organizations"
finland.161.d: "Rudolf Walden government has initiated a series of bans targeting Marxist organizations within the SDP and the Finnish Trade Unions. The primary focus of these measures was the so-called Left Group, a faction within the SDP led by Niilo Wälläri. Under the pretext of safeguarding the nation from what the government deemed as subversive elements, Walden's administration invoked the Kingdom Protection Act to implement these bans. Citing concerns about the influence of Marxist ideologies and potential ties to foreign entities, the government argued that these measures were essential for national security. The Left Group, led by Niilo Wälläri, had been a vocal advocate for socialist principles within the SDP. Their calls for more radical measures and revolutionary ideals had gained traction, especially in the wake of the Lapua Rebellion and the subsequent revolutionary fervor. Viewing the Left Group as a destabilizing force, the government aimed to curb their influence and prevent the spread of Marxist ideals.\n\nSimultaneously, the government's measures extended to SAK, seen as potential breeding grounds for leftist sentiments and activism. The ban encompassed restrictions on the activities of trade unions that were perceived to have close affiliations with Marxist ideologies. This move was aimed at weakening the organizational structures that could mobilize workers against the government. Walden's government justified these actions as necessary steps to suppress dissent and maintain order during a delicate period of political transition.\n\nNiilo Wälläri, now a prominent figure representing the targeted Left Group, vehemently denounced the bans as an assault on democratic principles. He framed the government's actions as an attempt to stifle political opposition and curtail the rights of those advocating for social justice and workers' rights. Despite this, he and his supporters were excluded from the SDP."
finland.161.a: "The SDP becomes weaker even more."
finland.161.b: "Not enough - outright ban SDP!"

finland.162.t: "Ban of the SDP"
finland.162.d: "Today, the government has announced the formal ban of the Social Democratic Party. This decision marked a drastic escalation in the ongoing crackdown on leftist and socialist elements following the Lapua Rebellion. Walden's administration invoked emergency powers and pointed to what they deemed as subversive activities within the SDP. Citing concerns about the party's alleged ties to Marxist and syndicalist ideologies, the government argued that banning the SDP was a crucial step in safeguarding the nation from what they perceived as a threat to its stability. The decision to ban the SDP was situated in the broader context of rising anti-socialist sentiment, fueled by the Lapua Rebellion and subsequent revolutionary activities. The government, viewing the SDP as a bastion of socialist influence, saw its elimination as a strategic move to reshape the political landscape in alignment with nationalist and conservative values. The ban led to the dissolution of the Social Democratic Party at both the national and local levels. Party offices were closed, assets were seized, and members were barred from engaging in political activities under the SDP banner. This move aimed not only at eradicating the political influence of the SDP but also at dismantling its organizational structures. Leaders of the SDP, now outlawed, condemned the government's action as an attack on democracy and a blatant violation of political freedoms."
finland.162.a: "A serious blow to syndicalism!"

finland.163.t: "The Blouse Act"
finland.163.d: "In response to the turbulent events surrounding the Lapua Rebellion and the growing influence of political movements like the Lapua Movement, the Svinhufvud government introduces the controversial 'Blouse Act.' This legislative move, named after the distinctive attire worn by Lapua Movement members, is designed to exert control over the activities of political organizations deemed a threat to public order. The act imposes limitations on public gatherings, especially those organized by political groups wearing uniforms. This includes increased scrutiny and regulation of events where such attire is prevalent. Law enforcement agencies are granted additional powers to monitor and surveil groups that fall under the purview of the Blouse Act. This includes keeping tabs on gatherings, speeches, and activities associated with the Lapua Movement.\n\nThe act is introduced as a temporary measure, with an initial period of validity until the end of 1937. However, the government reserves the right to extend this period if it deems the circumstances warrant such an extension. The rationale behind the 'Blouse Act' lies in addressing public concerns about the rising influence of paramilitary groups like the Lapua Movement and the Sinimustat, perceived as a threat to the democratic order. By restricting the public visibility of radical movements, the government aims to preserve public order and prevent the escalation of political tensions that could lead to violence. The act is also framed as a measure to curtail the activities of groups that might engage in extremist actions or pose a risk to the stability of the nation.\n\nPublic reaction to the 'Blouse Act' is mixed. While some segments applaud the government's efforts to control potentially disruptive movements, others criticize it as an infringement on civil liberties. Opposition parties, particularly the SDP, strongly criticize the act as an attempt to stifle political dissent and curb the activities of groups that oppose the government. The Lapua Movement, directly affected by the act, condemns it as an unjust restriction on their right to political expression. Some members express defiance by continuing to wear their distinctive uniform despite the legal constraints."
finland.163.a: "No more blue and black in public!"

finland.164.t: "Ban of the IKL"
finland.164.d: "The government now takes decisive action to address what it perceives as a growing threat from the IKL. Key measures of the Kingdom Protection Act implemented agsint the IKL includes: the government, utilizing the authority granted by the Kingdom Protection Act, officially bans the activities of the IKL. This includes public gatherings, political events, and any form of organizational activities conducted by the party. Law enforcement agencies are directed to take swift action against key figures within the IKL. Party leaders, prominent members, and individuals associated with the organization are to be arrested and detained based on the legal authority provided by the Kingdom Protection Act."
finland.164.a: "Is this the final end of radicalism?"

finland.165.t: "A Far-Right Endeavor"
finland.165.d: "The Finnish far-right movement sees a new development with the formation of the Finnish Realm Union (Suomalaisen Valtakunnan Liitto or SVL). The SVL is not a spontaneous creation but rather a result of calculated planning by the IKL leadership. Recognizing the need for alternative avenues and political platforms, they decide to establish the Finnish Realm Union to further their ideological goals. Its ideology revolves around a vision of a monolingual Greater Finland, corporatist economics, and a staunch opposition to any perceived syndicalist or socialist influence. The party maintains a clear continuity with the far-right ideologies of its predecessor. While the SVL is officially formed, its initial influence on the political scene is relatively limited. The political climate, shaped by recent events and the actions of other political entities, poses challenges for a new far-right party to gain immediate traction. Observers suggest that the Finnish Realm Union faces considerable obstacles in terms of public support and electoral success in the near future. The recent political shifts and the dominance of established parties make it challenging for a new entrant, especially one associated with the far-right, to rise rapidly."
finland.165.a: "Interesting..."

finland.166.t: "Repeal of Anti-Syndicalist Laws"
finland.166.d: "Prime Minister Tanner, leading a minority social democratic government, has announces plans to repeal the long-standing anti-syndicalist laws that have shaped Finnish politics for the last years. Tanner's proposal, however, faces immediate challenges within the parliament. The opposition vehemently opposes the repeal, including the most moderate Maalaisliitto. They argue that lifting the bans on syndicalist groups and communist parties poses a threat to the stability of the nation and risks allowing radical ideologies to gain ground. As the debate intensifies, opposition parties make it clear that they consider the repeal a matter of confidence in the government.\n\nThe opposition mobilizes its supporters, framing the issue as a pivotal moment for the future of Finland. Conservative media outlets contribute to the opposition's narrative, portraying the repeal as a dangerous experiment with the nation's political foundations. Tanner's minority government, lacking a clear majority in parliament, finds itself in a precarious position. As the political drama unfolds, there are internal divisions even within the Social Democratic Party."
finland.166.a: "Repeal the laws by any means!"
finland.166.b: "If we do it, we'll lose the elections!"

finland.167.t: "Government Resigns"
finland.167.d: "The National Coalition, staunchly opposed to the attempted repeal, seizes the moment to challenge the government. Kokoomus initiates a vote of no confidence, framing it as a necessary step to preserve the nation's stability and guard against what they view as radical influences. As parliamentary sessions unfold, the National Coalition, supported by other factions as well, argues that repealing the anti-syndicalist laws jeopardizes the nation's security and opens the door to dangerous ideologies. In a dramatic turn of events, the government, unable to secure sufficient support in Eduskunta, is compelled to resign. The repeal of the anti-syndicalist laws, once heralded as a significant step toward political reform, now becomes the catalyst for the downfall of the first-ever SDP-led government."
finland.167.a: "It becomes so easy to lose political capital."

finland.168.t: "Constitutional Reform"
finland.168.d: "In a strategic move to bridge longstanding ideological divides and solidify the foundations of Finnish democracy, the SDP government embarks on a bold initiative to reshape the constitutional framework. This initiative, marked by a nuanced understanding of political dynamics and a willingness to compromise, seeks to establish a more balanced parliamentary democracy in Finland. For nearly two decades, the absence of clear limitations on the monarch's powers has been a significant obstacle in the relationship between the monarchist National Coalition and other republican parties. The conservatives' resistance to curtailing the King's authority hindered the acceptance of a monarchist form of government by the republican factions. Drawing inspiration from the experiences of neighboring Scandinavian countries, where social democratic governments coexist with constitutional monarchies, the SDP sees an opportunity to redefine the political landscape in Finland. The pragmatic approach involves concessions, with the SDP acknowledging that certain far-left policies might need to be set aside in exchange for securing a constitutional arrangement that accommodates both republicans and monarchists.\n\nThe reforms outline specific constraints on the monarch's authority, defining the scope of royal influence within the democratic framework. This includes delineating ceremonial roles, delineating the monarch's involvement in the legislative process, and establishing protocols for the exercise of executive powers. The reforms reinforce the parliamentary system, ensuring that elected representatives have a central role in decision-making processes. This includes provisions for the formation and dissolution of governments, the conduct of elections, and the mechanisms for checks and balances within the parliamentary structure. The SDP government recognizes the need for stability in governance. The constitutional reforms encourage consensus-building mechanisms, fostering cooperation among political parties to address national challenges and minimize political polarization."
finland.168.a: "The Eduskunta majority finally adopts the reform!"

finland.169.t: "Constitutional Reform"
finland.169.d: "In a surprising and strategic move, the National Coalition sets in motion a plan to reshape the constitutional landscape of Finland. The National Coalition acknowledges that, for nearly two decades, the lack of clear limitations on the monarch's powers has been a stumbling block in political negotiations. The absence of a well-defined constitutional framework has strained relationships between the monarchist National Coalition and other republican parties, almost always leading to minority governments. While retaining a commitment to monarchist principles, the National Coalition shows a willingness to redefine the role of the monarch within a democratic framework. This involves considering specific constraints on the monarch's authority, delineating ceremonial roles, and ensuring a more ceremonial position that reflects the contemporary democratic ethos. The constitutional reforms put forward by Svinhufvud's government aim to strengthen governance structures. This includes provisions to enhance the effectiveness of the parliamentary system, specifying procedures for government formation, and streamlining legislative processes to foster efficiency. Furthermore, the National Coalition, understanding the necessity of stable governance, encourages mechanisms for consensus-building and cooperation among political parties. The reforms are designed to foster a sense of national unity, minimizing political polarization for the greater benefit of the Finnish people."
finland.169.a: "Almost unanimously, the reform passes!"

finland.170.t: "The Lapua Rebellion Trials"
finland.170.d: "In the aftermath of the Lapua Rebellion, Finland faced the daunting task of bringing to justice those involved in the Lohja uprising. The legal proceedings, conducted with the goal of maintaining order and unity, unfolded with distinct characteristics based on the prevailing government ideology. The trials, held in Turku Court of Appeal, saw 102 individuals charged with rebellion. Among them, prominent figures of the Lapua Movement faced the court's judgment: The court acknowledged Vihtori Kosola's role but framed the sentence with an understanding tone. Kosola received a 9-month prison sentence. Kurt Martti Wallenius, Major General and General Secretary of the Lapua Movement, despite his high-ranking position, was sentenced to 6 months in prison. Walde Sario, a financial backer of the Lapua Movement, received a suspended sentence with probation and community service. The rest of the accused received varying sentences, with a significant number receiving suspended sentences with community service."
finland.170.d2: "As the dust settled from the Lapua Rebellion, government embarked on a decisive legal journey to address the insurrection and send a clear message against radical movements. The court delivered a resounding verdict against Vihtori Kosola, the leader of the Lapua Movement. Charged with inciting rebellion, he received a hefty sentence of three years in prison, reflecting the severity with which the government viewed his role. Kurt Martti Wallenius, Major General and General Secretary of the Lapua Movement, despite his military background, faced a substantial two-year prison term. Walde Sario, Consul and Financial Supporter of the Lapua Movement found himself facing an 18-month prison sentence.\n\nThe trials were meticulously conducted in the Turku Court of Appeal, where prosecutors built cases that emphasized the conspiratorial nature of the Lapua Rebellion. The government, recognizing the importance of public sentiment, opted for public trials. The court proceedings were widely covered, amplifying the message that such actions against the state would not be tolerated. The sentencing aimed not only at punishment but also at sending a strong deterrent message. The government sought to quell any potential resurgence of far-right movements by imposing substantial prison terms."

finland.171.t: "The Folkspartiet's Strategy"
finland.171.d: "The Swedish People's Party (Folkspartiet or the RKP), traditionally a monarchist party with a a republican minority faction has historically aligned itself with the National Coalition, forming a united front against perceived threats to Swedish-speaking communities. However, the evolving political landscape, marked by the rise of the Lapua Movement and the emergence of the extreme right, compels the RKP to reconsider its traditional alliances.\n\nThe RKP could adhere to its historical affiliation with the National Coalition. This alliance, grounded in monarchist leanings and economic liberalism, has been a cornerstone of the party's strategy. On the other hand, a strategic move to balance its perceived alignment with Swedish-speaking interests involves forming an alliance with Maalaisliitto, a party deeply rooted in agrarian concerns. Finally, the RKP could make an unprecedented move by aligning with the SDP. This would signify a departure from traditional alliances and a hope of further federalization."

finland.172.t: "An Attempt at Rewilding Gone Awry"
finland.172.d: "Finland has long held its own ecosystems in the highest regards, for the natural beauty and health of the unique biosphere has always been a paramount concern for the Finnish people. However, history does not always play out as we hope, especially in the case of our local populations of the Eurasian beaver. Largely hunted to extinction by Finnish and Sámi hunters since 1868, beavers have become near impossible to find across most of Finland, prompting action from the state. Not only are beaver pelts and castoreum secretions still highly valuable, but the chunky little rodents are keystone species as well, increasing biodiversity in their territories through creation of ponds and wetlands with their dam-building habits, making for healthier and more long-lasting and self-balancing ecosystems, so in order to recreate a stable breeding population of these necessary little critters, our government has moved to importation.\n\nSeven beavers - 4 females and 3 males - have been sourced from Upstate New York in the Americas while an additional 17 Eurasian beavers have been sourced from other parts of Europe, with the hope being that these disparate groups will interbreed rapidly, aided by the larger litter sizes of the American variety. Though the threat of overpopulation shall easily be kept in check with expanded hunting licenses, some of our own biologists have gotten into a debate on the wider plan as a whole. Beavers both American and Eurasian are known to have many different subspecies capable of interbreeding like most other animals, but the debate has arisen over whether the Eurasian and American beavers are sub-species capable of inbreeding, or if they are two wholly separate species as some claim, which would throw a wrench in our plan and could lead to an invasive species threat as the fertile and fecund American beavers breed like rabbits, with some figures stating that there could be more than 12,000 of them within 50 or 60 years. However, advocates for the plan are certain that even if the American beavers cannot breed with the Eurasian ones, they will still be a net boon due to their ability to naturally fill the niches left empty by the extirpated Eurasian variety without any ill side-effects usually brought on by other invasive specimens. Regardless of their concerns, the plan is set to commence as the two groups of beavers are readied to be released into the Finnish Lakeland. Two different species of beaver? That’s insane. Surely this plan will go off without a hitch..."

The Social Democratic Party of [Root.GetName], who espouse policies in favour of the workers has been heavily supressed, and are unlikely to  take the lead in the election, however the Agrarian League, who espouse policies in favour of the farmers have surged in recent polls, and may have what it takes to form a government.\n\nDespite the Social Democrat's supression, the social democrats and agrarians have expressed willingness to form a coalition together in order to promote the stability and preservation of democracy within [Root.GetName].

finland_revolt.1.t: "Demands of the Lapua"
finland_revolt.1.d: "In the wake of recent workers' strikes, the local branch of the Lapua Movement in Lohja has seized the opportunity to make a bold move. Alleging infiltration of syndicalists in social-democratic workers' associations, the movement has sent a direct demand to Hjalmar Procopé, the Minister of Interior. Procopé, a liberal member of the Swedish People's Party, our coalition ally, now stands at a crossroads, faced with a decision that could have profound implications. The Lapua Movement demands the closure of all people's houses in Lohja, considering them hotbeds of syndicalist influence. These houses, legally established components of the community, have become a flashpoint for the far-right group's discontent. Procopé, in his role as Minister of Interior, grapples with a dilemma that could significantly influence the course of events: opting to accept the Lapua Movement's demands might be seen as a concession by the government. It could set a perilous precedent, signaling that legal entities can be shut down under the pressure of radical factions. This choice risks compromising the government's commitment to civil liberties. Conversely, refusing the Lapua Movement's demands sends a resolute message that the government won't yield to threats. However, this decision could further escalate tensions, potentially resulting in clashes between Lapua supporters and those advocating for the preservation of the workers' houses."

finland_revolt.2.t: "Escalating Tensions in Lohja"
finland_revolt.2.d: "In the aftermath of Minister Procopé's refusal to shut down the people's houses, the Lapua Movement took matters into its own hands. Defying legal norms, they forcibly closed not only the Lohja people's house but also targeted several others. In Lohja, tensions reached a boiling point when Mikko Erich, an SDP member of Eduskunta, planned to deliver a speech at the reopened People's House. A former member of the National Coalition, Erich was considered a traitor by the Lapua Movement. Despite warnings from Väinö Tanner, Erich proceeded with his speech. During the speech, approximately 400-700 members of the local White Guard, led by Lieutenant Esra Terä — a Lapua Movement enthusiast — interrupted the gathering. Firing shots into the ground and air, the White Guard's actions resulted in stray bullets penetrating the People's House, albeit without causing injuries. Lieutenant Terä confronted Erich, questioning his actions in a town scarred by the memories of the Finnish War of Independence. Inside the People's House, Terä and Erich engaged in a heated exchange. Terä demanded Erich's promise to stay away from Lohja in the future, to which Erich reluctantly agreed before leaving under police escort.\n\nIn light of these events, Uusimaa county governor Ilmari Helenius faces a critical decision. Shocked by the unfolding situation, he must choose between sending police reinforcements to Lohja to restore order or maintaining a hands-off approach to prevent further escalation."

Contrary to expectations, Lapua Movement supporters interpret this as protecting syndicalists, triggering a cascade of similar activities in neighboring areas. Helenius, seeking to assert authority, issues orders for the arrest of those involved. Undeterred, 400 Lapua Movement members gather at Lohja's White Guard hall, refusing to disperse or surrender the accused. The atmosphere is charged as Lieutenant Artturi Vuorimaa emerges as the spiritual leader, embodying the fervor of the movement.\n\nIn a passionate speech, Vuorimaa articulates their declaration of rebellion addressed to the King. The document vehemently opposes Syndicalism and Marxism, accusing the government, particularly figures like Helenius and Procopé, of leading the nation to destruction. The declaration vows not to yield, proclaiming the necessity of defeating Syndicalism even at the cost of challenging the state power protecting it. Closing with a stark warning of an impending civil war, the Lapua Movement declares that the state's power may crush their troops but will fail to overcome the mass of patriotic people surging against it.\n\nThe declaration of rebellion ended with the words:\n\n\"History once will give judgment to both us and our opponents\""

The Lapua Movement's leadership, after swift deliberations, unanimously agrees to back Lohja. Concurrently, armed forces continue to converge on Lohja without explicit orders from the movement, reflecting the escalating tensions on the ground. Vihtori Kosola and Wallenius position themselves in Hämeenlinna to closely monitor the unfolding developments. Using the Suojeluskunta apparatus, the Lapua Movement initiates an alarm, mobilizing men who don the uniform, weapons, and equipment of the White Guard.

Troops are strategically deployed to protect key locations against potential attacks from Lapua Movement forces. In response to the escalating crisis, the government contemplates invoking the Kingdom Protection Act. Initially enacted against the syndicalists, the Act could now be wielded against the Lapua Movement. If implemented, the Act empowers the government to order the arrest of the Lapua Movement's leadership and the closure of its newspapers. This move carries significant implications. On one hand, it would render all actions by the Lapua Movement definitively illegal, marking them as acts against state and social order. This could quash the movement's influence and activities, restoring a semblance of order. On the other hand, such a drastic measure risks further escalation, leaving little room for peaceful resolution. Outlawing the Lapua Movement might solidify its stance as a radical force, potentially pushing it towards more extreme actions in defiance."

In response to these actions, the Lapua Movement delegation convenes in Hämeenlinna's City Hotel. They issue a statement, asserting that the current social unrest cannot be pacified unless the government resigns immediately, and a new political direction is charted for the country.

The decision is made to arrest the movement's leadership, including Vihtori Kosola and Major General K. M. Wallenius, and disband the pro-Lapua White Guards. With the backing of loyalist forces, Jäger troops move swiftly to execute the orders. In a coordinated effort, the Lapua Movement's leaders are apprehended.

Simultaneously, in Lohja, Artturi Vuorimaa is arrested, and the White Guards, once supportive of Lapua, are forcefully disbanded.\n\nThe government's forceful action establishes Svinhufvud as the victor in the struggle against the Lapua Movement. However, this victory comes at a cost, as the influence of the SDP and Väinö Tanner grows. Despite securing his government, some officials resign from their offices, and within the National Coalition, internal divisions emerge. A faction within the party, aggrieved by what they perceive as treacherous syndicalist sympathizers, departs, calling for justice.\n\nIn the aftermath, the focus shifts to the legal proceedings against the leaders of the Lohja Rebellion.

This division escalates quickly, splitting the country between the loyalists of the Royal Army and the government and the Lapua Movement, the White Guard, and their supporters. The crackdown fails, and the Lapua Movement seizes the opportunity to announce a March on Helsinki. Increasingly, White Guards join the rebellion as they see support within their leadership.

Simultaneously, the King of Finland and the Kruununprinssi flee the country, escorted by some of his loyalists. With the March on Helsinki concluded, Wallenius declares the fall of the government. A provisional stabilization government takes its place, led by Vihtori Kosola, while Wallenius becomes the self-proclaimed Regent, as the Throne becomes absent. The nation stands on the brink of a new era, with the Lapua Movement seizing control.\n\nAs the Lapua Rebellion unfolds, General Mannerheim, witnessing the worsening situation and realizing the need for decisive action,with the backing of influential faction within a General Staff command, stages a forceful intervention. As Mannerheim hoped for a government led by General Walden, the Lapua government and Wallenius as a self-proclaimed Regent forced him to start acting. The White Guards have immediately obeyed their honored ruler, and arrest key figures of the Lapua Movement, including Vihtori Kosola and K. M. Wallenius. The counter-coup is carried out with military precision, avoiding widespread bloodshed but firmly quashing the rebellion."

finland_revolt.9.d: "In a surprising turn of events, Prime Minister Pehr Evind Svinhufvud voluntarily resigns in response to the Lapua Movement's demands. General Rudolf Walden steps in as the country's interim prime minister until new elections can be held. The voluntary resignation of Svinhufvud creates unrest among the National Coalition, and the atmosphere of fear, stemming from the Lohja Rebellion, increases the popularity of the SDP. The Lapua Movement's influence sees a significant rise, especially within the new interim government. Svinhufvud's resignation, conducted legally, almost entirely dismantles any remaining resistance to the Lapua Rebellion within the armed forces and the Suojeluskunta. In a last act before leaving office, the government cancels the Kingdom Protection Act, signaling a significant concession to the Lapua Movement. The interim government, just taking power, is expected to bring about radical changes in Finland."

finland_revolt.10.t: "Svinhufvud’s Speech"
finland_revolt.10.d: "Prime Minister Svinhufvud addresses the nation, delivering a speech that shakes the foundations of the Lapua Rebellion. The impact is immediate, causing a wave of hesitation among rebels and potential participants. Following the speech, the rebel White Guard district of Southern Ostrobothnia, ready to set off for Lohja, chooses to stay put, closely monitoring the evolving situation. Meanwhile, the Lohja rebels, sensing a potential defeat and appearing somewhat desperate, releases a declaration via a newspaper. The message urges the people to rise in a common fight and questions the government's attempts to deceive. Despite the Priem Minister's speech, rebels in Jyväskylä strengthen their position, attempting to disrupt a provincial assembly that supports the government and the King. The rebel delegation continues to demand a change of government, nominating Rudolf Walden as prime minister. Simultaneously, concerns about the rebels' fate after the rebellion become apparent.\n\nThe army responds by blockading the rebel center in Lohja. Prime Minister Svinhufvud appoints Elja Rihtniemi as the official negotiator to engage with Lapua's representatives in Lohja. The rebels' will to fight diminishes further upon learning about the suicide of respected Lapua leader Kustaa \"Köpi\" Latvala in Seinäjoki. Frustrated and seemingly protesting the lack of proper planning in the Lapua Movement beyond the destruction of the syndicalist printing press, Latvala's suicide adds to the complex emotions. In a suicide message, she implores mercy for the rebels, emphasizing that they are not criminals. Negotiations proceed, and a tired leadership of the Lapua Movement decides to dissolve the rebellion, with the help of Lieutenant Colonel Elja Rihtniemi, authorized by Svinhufvud. Fear and tension grip Lohja's White Guard Hall, where Wallenius, through song and commemoration, manages to pacify the atmosphere. At this stage, only 466 men remain in Lohja, marking the somber end of the rebellion."

finland_revolt.11.d: "The confrontation in Lohja between Mikko Erich and the White Guard, led by Lieutenant Esra Terä, sends shockwaves through Uusimaa. Governor Ilmari Helenius, witnessing the volatile situation, opts for a hands-off approach, refraining from direct intervention to prevent further escalation. In the aftermath, the Lapua Movement sees the events as a triumph, interpreting Erich's forced departure as a victory for their cause. The lack of police interference bolsters their confidence, further consolidating support among their followers. However, the seemingly triumphant moment quickly transforms into a catalyst for more radical demands. The Lapua leadership, emboldened by what they perceive as a victory, issues a new set of demands: the closure of all people's houses in Finland, along with a public ban on the recently established Central Federation of Trade Unions and the SDP. Now faced with increasingly extreme demands, the government is forced to reassess its strategy. The question looms: should they once again yield to the radicals' demands, as seen in the Peasant March three years ago, or take a firm stand against what they perceive as unlawful and extreme requests from the Lapua Movement?"

finland_revolt.12.d: "The government's decision to ignore the Lapua Movement's initial demands becomes a turning point, leading to an escalation in their radicalization. Fueled by the belief that the government's silence is a tacit endorsement of syndicalism and social democracy, the Lapuans intensify their calls for action. In this atmosphere of growing radicalism, the movement's demands evolve. Now, in addition to the closure of people's houses and the ban on trade unions and the SDP, the Lapuans demand the resignation of the government. This unexpected twist, despite their respect for prime minister Svinhufvud, is seen as a strategy to force his hand into banning the SDP. Lieutenant Artturi Vuorimaa emerges as the spiritual leader among the Lohja rebels, embodying the fervor and determination of the Lapua Movement. In a passionate and fiery speech, Vuorimaa articulates their declaration of rebellion, addressed directly to the King and Prime Minister. The document condemns Syndicalism and Marxism, placing blame on figures like Procopé for allegedly leading the nation towards destruction. The declaration declares an unwavering commitment to their cause, asserting the necessity of defeating Syndicalism even if it means challenging the very state power that protects it. Vuorimaa issues a stark warning of an impending civil war, emphasizing that while the state's power may crush their troops, it will fail to overcome the mass of patriotic people rallying against it. The declaration concludes with a solemn note, asserting that history will be the judge of both the Lapua Movement and their opponents."

finland_revolt.13.d: "Faced with the escalating demands of the Lapua Movement to ban the SDP and trade unions, the Svinhufvud government is caught in a complex and politically perilous situation. The prospect of utilizing the previously adopted Kingdom Protection Act to ban the SDP and suppress trade unions presents a host of serious obstacles. Foremost among these challenges is the SDP's substantial representation in Eduskunta. Any move to ban the largest faction in the parliament risks being perceived as a dictatorial self-coup, particularly given the National Coalition's minority government status. Svinhufvud, recognizing the potential for a deepening crisis, fears that such a ban could lead to a repeat of the circumstances that triggered the Finnish War of Independence.\n\nAcknowledging the government's inability to effectively handle the looming conflict, Svinhufvud contemplates resignation. This opportune moment is seized by the Lapua Movement, which puts forward its own candidate for the position of prime minister: General Rudolf Walden. For Svinhufvud, the decision is clear: to resign, allowing Walden to take interim leadership until elections."

finland_revolt.14.d: "In the wake of the government's decision not to invoke the Kingdom Protection Act, the Lapua Movement seizes upon what they perceive as a victory and intensifies their demands, pushing the nation further into a precarious situation. Seeing the government's hesitancy as a sign of weakness, the Lapua Movement leadership issues another public statement. In this declaration, they not only solidify their demand for the closure of people's houses but escalate their rhetoric. The new demands now include the immediate ban on the SAK and the complete outlawing of the SDP. The Lapua Movement portrays these demands as essential for safeguarding the nation against what they deem to be the insidious influence of syndicalism. Their propaganda machine goes into overdrive, framing the government's reluctance as evidence of collusion with syndicalists and social democrats.\n\nThis turn of events leaves the government at a critical crossroads. The SDP, having the largest faction in Eduskunta, vehemently opposes the ban and frames it as a dictatorial power grab. With tensions already high, such a move could plunge the nation into a crisis akin to the War of Independence. The government faces a dilemma: acquiesce to the Lapua Movement's demands and risk sparking widespread protests and unrest, or stand firm and face accusations of protecting syndicalists. Prime Minister Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, aware of the precarious situation, engages in strategic calculations. He contemplates the possible consequences of using force against Lapua, considering the loyalty of various military factions. The Lapua Movement gains momentum, attracting sympathizers and recruits from various parts of the country. Their perceived victory in Lohja becomes a symbol of defiance against what they see as a corrupt political establishment. Calls for a ban on the SDP and the closure of people's houses echo in various regions. In response, the SDP rallies its base, preparing for a fierce political battle."

In a bid to prevent further unrest and potential violence, Prime Minister Pehr Evind Svinhufvud announces a compromise. The government agrees to close down specific people's houses identified by the Lapua Movement, hoping that this concession will appease the radical faction. However, this move triggers outrage from the SDP and its supporters, who view it as a betrayal of democratic principles. Furthermore, even traditionally pro-governmental parties, like the Swedish People's Party and the Agrarian League turns away from the Kokoomus.\n\nMass protests erupt across major cities. The government's compromise fails to quell the fervor of the Lapua Movement, which interprets it as a sign of weakness. Emboldened, the Lapuans intensify their calls for broader bans, including the outlawing of the SDP. Losing all support and outnumbered in Eduskunta, the government has no other choice to resign in favor of Rudolf Walden, who is to lead a compromise interim government until next election, triggering a new wave of political chaos as the nation becomes ready for the elections."

Prime Minister Pehr Evind Svinhufvud categorically rejects the calls to ban the SDP and shut down people's houses, asserting that such actions would undermine the foundations of Finnish democracy. The response from the Lapua Movement is swift and incendiary. Viewing the government's stance as a direct challenge to their vision for a syndicalist-free Finland, the Lapuans escalate their activities. Mass protests, strikes, and acts of civil disobedience are organized across the country, creating a climate of unrest. The White Guards, sympathetic to the Lapua cause, mobilize in various regions, putting additional pressure on the government. As the political standoff intensifies, Finland becomes increasingly divided. The situation reaches a point where the government is forced to consider the deployment of security forces to maintain order, risking further polarization and potential clashes on the streets."

Within days of the government shift, Lapua Movement leaders, including Vihtori Kosola and K. M. Wallenius, issue a bold and assertive set of demands, published in \"Ajan Sana\" newspaper. The Lapua Movement, seizing the opportunity presented by the change in government, demands the immediate resignation of the newly formed Tanner's cabinet. They argue that this change is necessary to ensure the removal of perceived socialist and syndicalist influences within the administration. The Lapua Movement sees this as a crucial step in safeguarding the nation's interests and preventing what they view as a drift towards ideologies they consider detrimental to Finland. Furthermore, they demand the immediate ban on all communist and syndicalist organizations. They argue that these groups pose a significant threat to the nation's stability and are responsible for what they perceive as the erosion of traditional values. In an effort to curb what they view as the influence of radical leftist elements, the Lapua Movement demands strict restrictions on workers' strikes. They argue that unregulated strikes contribute to social unrest and undermine the authority of the state. The Lapua Movement calls for a thorough purge of individuals affiliated with leftist or socialist ideologies from public institutions, including government offices, schools, and cultural organizations. They assert that such measures are essential to prevent the infiltration of socialist ideals into the fabric of Finnish society."

The rejection further deepens the ideological chasm between the government and the Lapua Movement. In response to the government's outright rejection, the Lapua Movement swiftly mobilizes its supporters. Kosola and Wallenius, alongside local leaders, rally their followers with fiery speeches, framing the government's refusal as a betrayal of national values. As a result, protests erupt in various cities, becoming focal points for both Lapua Movement supporters and those opposing their agenda. Newspapers, radio broadcasts, and other media outlets amplify the ideological clash. Government-friendly sources defend the rejection of Lapua's demands, while Lapua Movement-aligned outlets frame the government's stance as a threat to national values."

finland_revolt.19.d: "The Lapua Movement intensifies its campaign against perceived enemies of the nation by resorting to one of its favored tactics — kidnapping or 'Muilutus'. The victim this time is Mikko Erich, a prominent SDP member of the Eduskunta, known for his affiliations with left-leaning ideologies. The Lapua Movement sends shockwaves through the nation by not only kidnapping Erich but also issuing a threat to send him on a boat to the French Commune. Mikko Erich was once a member of the National Coalition but switched allegiance to the SDP, a move that was seen as a betrayal by the Lapua Movement, making him a symbolic target. Erich is known for his strong advocacy for workers' rights and has been a vocal proponent of civil liberties and democratic values. His stance against the Lapua Movement's tactics made him a thorn in the side of the far-right organization, marking him as a target for their campaign of intimidation.\n\nOn a seemingly ordinary day, Erich is forcefully abducted by members of the Lapua Movement. The daring abduction occurs in broad daylight, adding to the audacity of the act. The Lapua sends a message to the government, threatening to send Erich to the French Commune. The threat is clear — if the government does not accede to their demands, Erich will be shipped off\n\nThe government, already grappling with nationwide protests and growing unrest, convenes an emergency cabinet meeting to address the kidnapping crisis. Väinö Tanner, the Prime Minister, leads discussions on how to handle this alarming development. In a press conference, Tanner denounces the Lapua Movement's tactics, labeling the kidnapping as an act of terror against democracy. He reaffirms the government's commitment to democratic principles and vows not to yield to acts of coercion. Despite the grave threat to Erich's life, the government takes a firm stance, refusing to negotiate with what they term as terrorists. This decision reflects the government's resolve not to succumb to the Lapua Movement's intimidation tactics."

Public squares become arenas for impassioned speeches, with fiery rhetoric condemning far-right extremism. Simultaneously, Lapua Movement sympathizers organize their own rallies, proudly displaying their support for the far-right cause.\n\nThe government faces intense scrutiny as questions about the administration's ability to maintain law and order loom large. Exploiting the chaos they've generated, the Lapua Movement issues a bold set of political demands. Their list includes the dissolution of the current government, echoing their earlier calls. The movement frames this as a necessary step for the safe release of Mikko Erich, attempting to leverage the crisis for political gain. Simultaneously, the Lapua Movement intensifies their threats, outlining a strict timeline for the government to comply. Failure to meet their demands, they warn, will result in severe consequences for Erich.\n\nWithin the government, internal debates unfold about the best course of action. While resolute in not negotiating with terrorists, some advocate for a firm stance, emphasizing that yielding to the Lapua Movement's demands sets a perilous precedent. In an unexpected turn of events, the government, despite its initial reservations, decides to implement the Kingdom Protection Act against the Lapua Movement.

Kosola, in a fiery speech, articulates the movement's rebellion against the perceived threat of Syndicalism and Marxism. The declaration condemns the government, especially figures like Tanner and Erich, accusing them of leading the nation toward destruction.

This would sever ties with the German monarch, presenting an opportunity for Finland to chart an independent course.

Initially rooted in economic grievances, these strikes took a political turn, with workers now demanding not just improved labor conditions. The strikes, initially modest, gained momentum as news of the Lohja Rebellion spread. The atmosphere of fear created by the far-right rebellion drove more workers to join the strikes, transforming what started as economic demands into a broader call for political change. The tumult in Lohja absorbed the government's attention, and the broader strikes happening concurrently remained largely unnoticed. The National Coalition, dealing with the fallout of the rebellion and internal divisions, was blindsided by the scale of the workers' protests. Fueled by the chaos and uncertainty, the striking workers articulated political demands, echoing the sentiments of the SDP. Calls for democratic reforms, workers' representation in government, and a shift away from conservative policies gained prominence among the strikers. The Social Democratic Party, already gaining influence due to its alignment with the government against the Lapua Movement, found itself in a favorable position.

What began as labor strikes, initially confined to economic concerns, rapidly evolved into a sweeping wave of dissent, fueled by a potent mixture of political, economic, and social grievances. The government's forceful crackdown on the Lapua Movement, while suppressing one form of dissent, only served to amplify the growing discontent within the broader working class. As the strikes gained momentum, the demands of the protesters broadened from immediate economic relief to encompass sweeping political reforms. Väinö Tanner's Social Democratic Party, despite initial attempts to distance itself from what they labeled as foreign-influenced protests, found itself caught in the tide of revolutionary fervor. The protesters' primary demand, voiced through the Trade Unions, was the lifting of the ban on socialist press — a restrictive measure imposed by the government under the influence of the Lapua Movement.\n\nThe Svinhufvud government, unyielding in its opposition to syndicalist influences, had no intention of making concessions. Instead, their strategy was to deploy the White Guard, staunchly anti-syndicalist, against the protesters and strikers. The first clashes had already erupted in Lohja, and the violence there set a dangerous precedent for the unfolding conflict. As the strikes spread across the country, the streets became battlegrounds. The police, backed by the White Guard, clashed with the strikers, further escalating tensions. The revolutionary momentum, once confined to economic demands, now sought to challenge the very foundations of the existing political order. The SDP, despite its historical association with workers' movements, was concerned about maintaining its standing among Finnish political parties, refrained from endorsing the revolutionary actions. The coming days promised uncertainty, but one thing was clear — Finland was in flames, and the fire of revolution showed no signs of abating."

Wälläri's journey from a former member of the banned SSTP to a leading force in the Finnish socialist movement marked a compelling chapter in the unfolding drama. After spending six years behind bars for his revolutionary activities, Wälläri emerged with a renewed determination. Undeterred by his past incarceration, he founded the Left Group of Finnish Workers, a bastion of socialist ideals that quickly rose to prominence within the socialist movement, rivaling even the Social Democratic Party SDP. The Left Group's proposal to collaborate with the SDP against the rising threat of the Lapua Movement was a pivotal moment. However, the SAJ, resistant to this collaboration, faced severe consequences with authorities swiftly banned all SAJ activities a few years ago, leading to the dissolution of its organizations. Undeterred by this crackdown, the leaders of the Left Group, including Wälläri, joined forces with the SDP to establish a new trade union organization. Wälläri, having joined the SDP in 1935, to secure legal ground for his activities, now found himself in a position of influence as the chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions. This move marked the realization of his political ambitions, but it also set the stage for a dramatic rupture. As the call for a general strike reverberated across the nation, Wälläri, now in the vanguard of the revolutionary movement, openly advocated for nothing short of a revolution in Finland. However, his bold stance did not find unanimous support within the SDP. The majority opinion, led by Väinö Tanner, staunchly opposed the strikes and Wälläri's revolutionary fervor. In a swift and decisive move, Wälläri was ousted from the SDP. The public opinion, critical of Tanner's decision, viewed Wälläri as a symbol of the radical change many sought in the face of the government's resistance to socialist ideals. The formation of the Red Guards, with Wälläri at its helm, marked a critical turning point in Finland's revolutionary trajectory. The fires of change were now fueled by a charismatic leader with a fervent commitment to reshaping the nation."

finland_revolution.4.t: "The Clash of the Guards"
finland_revolution.4.d: "As the revolutionary momentum surges and the government grapples with a decision regarding the White Guard's role, the streets of Finnish cities become a battleground between two opposing non-governmental forces — the Red Guards and the White Guard, setting a grim reminder of the War of Independence. The Red Guards, fueled by the fervor of the revolutionary call, assemble in various cities, particularly Helsinki and Viipuri. Armed with a mix of firearms and makeshift weapons, they prepare for a clash against the Suojeluskunta. The first clashes occur near strategic points in Viipuri. Tensions escalate as shots are fired, tear gas clouds the air, and barricades are erected by both non-governmental forces. The clash quickly transforms into a full-fledged urban conflict. Civilians caught in the crossfire flee the city center, seeking refuge from the chaos.\n\nAs the clashes between the Red Guards and the White Guard escalate, the Finnish government faces a critical decision regarding the deployment of the armed forces. In an emergency session, Prime Minister Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, flanked by key ministers and military advisors, addresses the urgent matter at hand. The central question revolves around whether to deploy the Finnish Armed Forces against the revolutionaries or to maintain a neutral stance, allowing the non-governmental forces to resolve the conflict among themselves. Some within the government argue for the immediate deployment of the armed forces, emphasizing the need to swiftly quell the unrest to prevent further loss of life and damage to property. They highlight the potential danger of allowing non-governmental forces to engage in open conflict without military intervention. Others express concerns about the repercussions of deploying the military against Finnish citizens. They fear that such an action could escalate the conflict, turning a relatively contained clash into a full-scale civil war. The memories of the recent Lapua Movement unrest are still fresh, and the government is wary of repeating a scenario where internal strife undermines the stability of the nation.\n\nOn the other side, proponents of neutrality argue that allowing the non-governmental forces to confront each other might lead to a more internally acceptable resolution. They emphasize the importance of avoiding a direct military confrontation within Finnish borders, which could have long-lasting consequences for the nation's unity."
finland_revolution.4.a: "Command von Gerich to support Suojeluskunta."
finland_revolution.4.b: "The army should stay out of this!"

finland_revolution.5.t: "Revolution in Finland!"
finland_revolution.5.d: "In the wake of the government's decision to keep the armed forces neutral in the clashes between the Red Guards and the White Guard, the situation in Finland takes a drastic turn. Emboldened by the government's reluctance to use the armed forces, the Red Guards, under the leadership of Niilo Wälläri, intensify their efforts. In a coordinated move, they seize control of Helsinki and Viipuri, the two vital urban centers in Finland. This unexpected turn of events catches the army off guard, as they were stationed throughout the country, expecting to be called upon to intervene. With the key cities under their control, the revolutionaries move quickly to secure vital strategic objectives. Important government buildings, communication centers, and transportation hubs fall into the hands of the Red Guards, consolidating their influence over the country. Furthermore, the Red Guards surround government offices in Helsinki. Prime Minister Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, caught off guard by the rapid escalation, finds himself facing arrest. Chief of the Royal Army Paul von Gerich, who was also unprepared for the sudden turn of events, is taken into custody alongside other high-ranking officials.\n\nAmidst the chaos and the Red Guards' rapid advance, the King of Finland, facing an increasingly untenable situation, makes the fateful decision to flee the country. The departure of the monarch marks the symbolic end of the old order and paves the way for the revolutionary forces to assert their vision for a socialist Finland. Taking advantage of the power vacuum left by the King's departure, Niilo Wälläri declares Finland a Socialist Republic. In a public address, he outlines the principles of the new government, emphasizing socialist values, workers' rights, and a commitment to creating a more equitable society. Despite the significant success of the revolution, pockets of resistance persist among the White Guards and other factions loyal to the old order. The demobilization of the Royal Army adds to the challenges of maintaining order. The Red Guards, now in a position of authority, face the task of quelling these pockets of resistance and ensuring a smooth transition to the newly declared socialist republic."
finland_revolution.5.a: "Tampere was finally avenged!"

finland_revolution.6.t: "Army Intervention Crushes Revolution"
finland_revolution.6.d: "In a decisive move to curb the revolutionary fervor spreading through Finland, Prime Minister Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, backed by the National Coalition and key military figures, orders the deployment of the Finnish armed forces. The intervention aims to quell the uprising and maintain the existing order. As the armed forces move in to suppress the Red Guards and revolutionary elements, clashes erupt in the streets of major cities. The government, alarmed by the rapid escalation of the situation, believes that a firm and forceful response is necessary to prevent what they view as a threat to the established social and political structure. Despite initial momentum, the revolutionary forces find themselves overwhelmed by the superior firepower and organization of the Finnish armed forces. The clashes are fierce, leading to a series of confrontations in which the revolutionaries face significant setbacks.\n\nNiilo Wälläri, the charismatic leader at the forefront of the revolution, is targeted by government forces. As the armed forces close in on key revolutionary figures, Wälläri is apprehended, effectively dismantling a central pillar of the movement. With the suppression of the revolution, the dream of a socialist republic in Finland shatters, once again."

FIN_mounting_dissent_idea: "Mounting Dissent"
FIN_mounting_dissent_idea_desc: "Like many nations in these turbulent times, Finland finds itself in an ever increasing climate of radicalization and popular discontent. The calm which set in after the War of Independence gave way in recent decades to exponential growth in anti-German rhetoric targeting both the monarchy and the ruling Kokoomus government, as well as violent clashes between right-wing militants of the Lapua Movement supported by the White Guards and left-wing militants within the trade unionist sphere. It remains to be seen if the Finnish establishment manages to navigate the coming storm or will the passions of the Finnish populace boil over and shatter the status quo."
FIN_ukrainian_grain_imports_idea: "Ukrainian Grain Imports"
FIN_ukrainian_grain_imports_idea_desc: "Finland, being that its lands are rather poor for the cultivation of certain types of grass, has been forced to rely upon the nation of Ukraine for grain imports so as to avoid being faced with a lack of food for its people. And while Ukraine is often referred to as the ‘breadbasket of Europe’ and possesses the resource in abundance, our reliance upon their grain is uncertain at best as unforeseen future circumstances could force the nation to slow down or halt grain shipments entirely, leaving us in a dire situation."

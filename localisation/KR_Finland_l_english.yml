finland.1.d:0 "Following the introduction of the [Root.GetAdjective] Declaration of Independence by Pehr Svinhufvud’s Senate on the 4th of December, 1917 and the subsequent declaration of independence from [RUS.GetNameDef] by Finland on the 6th of December, 1917, [Root.GetAdjective] society saw itself divided amongst two groups: the Red Guards, led by Ali Aaltonen, and the White Guards, led by Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim.\n\nIt wasn’t long before a civil war broke out between Red Finland, which was composed primarily of members of the Social Democratic Party of Finland, and White Finland, composed of forces under the Svinhufvud Senate alongside German-trained Jäger troops.\n\nAfter three months of vicious warfare, the German-backed Whites were able to push the Reds and the People’s Delegation out of Helsinki and eventually surround the retreating forces who were subsequently forced to surrender.\n\nOut of the ashes of the [Root.GetAdjective] Civil War rose [Root.GetNameDef], a rabidly anti-socialist nation led by Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, or King Fredrik Kaarle I as he had come to be known following his coronation as King of Finland.\n\nDespite enjoying a period of peace and protection as an unofficial [GER.GetAdjective] protectorate, a certain sense of political resent has begun to develop within the [Root.GetAdjective] populace due to the pervasiveness of Germany and [GER.GetAdjective]-affiliated officers and companies within [Root.GetNameDef]. In addition, radicals, from both the left and right, have begun to slowly consolidate power after years of negligence by the King and the National Coalition..."

finland.2.d:0 "It seems as though [Root.GetNameDef] has not been able to bypass the economic hardship faced by [GER.GetNameDef] and the other members of Mitteleuropa. With the plummeting of the Berlin Stock Exchange on the 3rd of February, [GER.GetNameDef]’s economy was sent into free-fall, bringing down with it a substantial chunk of the world.\n\nThis economic downturn has hit [Root.GetNameDef] at a very unfortunate time due to problems at home and abroad. It is no secret to many that, despite being an agricultural nation, Finland does not possess much arable land and, thus, struggles to feed its populace by itself. This has left [Root.GetNameDef] in a position whereby it is forced to purchase [UKR.GetAdjective] grain in order to properly sustain its populace and avoid further dissent.\n\nOn top of all this, however, is mounting dissent from the [Root.GetAdjective] people, who have slowly, yet surely, begun to radicalise and call for an end to dependency on the [GER.GetAdjective]s. Black Monday has only granted further legitimacy to radical movements such as the Lapua Movement and the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation have slowly begun to make a comeback, giving the radical groups greater impetus. Demonstrations have already sprung up in many areas. It seems as though the [Root.GetNameDef] is hanging by a thread..."

finland.4.t:0 "The Peasant March"
finland.4.d:0 "Aiming to undermine the National Coalition and profess [Root.GetAdjective] nationalism, the Lapua Movement, breaking with their existing ties with the party, have begun a so-called ‘Peasant March’ in Helsinki, which tens of thousands of Finns have attended.\n\nLed by several prominent far-right [Root.GetAdjective] nationalists, Kurt Martti Wallenius amongst them, the marchers chanted for the ‘emancipation of [Root.GetNameDef]’ from the ‘[GER.GetAdjective] oppressors’.\n\nIndeed, King [Root.GetLeader] has been worried by the recent uptick in anti-monarchist/ultranationalist sentiment, seeing the marches as mere opportunism and a ploy by the far-right to destabilise [Root.GetNameDef]. As it stands, the coalition between the National Coalition and Lapua Movement had already become shaky in recent years. This blatant attack against the monarchy has only served to sever the ties between the monarchists and ultranationalists."

A substantial minority within the SDP and the socialists that have been forced underground by the government wish to see Manner freed, while some of the more moderate liberals in [Root.GetNameDef] oppose his conviction on the grounds of impartially by the Supreme Treason Court.\n\nIn any case, it comes as a surprise to many that the socialists who had been largely eradicated and forced underground have finally come out of hiding to protest and petition for Manner’s, who is still considered the de jure chairman of the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation, release. Many of the more rabidly anti-socialist politicians have begun cursing the name of the syndicalists for sabotaging the current financial instability within [Root.GetNameDef] for mere political opportunism."

Apparently, it seems as though the Lapua Movement had decided to take matters into their hands and, following the news of the resurgence of the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation, have decided to hunt down any remaining syndicalists in the hopes of rooting them out. It seems as though the hunt did not go as planned, however, as the Red Guard, who appear to be working with the People’s Delegation, made an appearance.\n\nReports have described the violent fighting that broke out between the two groups, with the clash proving to be inconclusive as neither side was able to gain the upper hand. Eventually, however, the fighting died down.\n\nKing [Root.GetLeader] and the National Coalition have been very worried about the ongoing events as they have only served to further sow the seeds of dissent within the [Root.GetAdjective] population while also destabilising [Root.GetNameDef]."

On the other hand, however, moderate conservatives within the National Coalition, alongside the social democrats, have advocated for letting the situation be and have made the point that dissent within [Root.GetNameDef] is already high enough and that any government intervention could lead to ordinary citizens joining in on taking radical action. It is clear, however, that the King must make a choice, and fast, lest the current window of opportunity escape."

Both sides stood their ground for a long time, yet no fighting took place.\n\nWhile King [Root.GetLeader] let out a sigh of relief upon hearing the positive news of a lack of fighting, many politicians and loyal military advisors have become worried as they feel that this may be the beginning of a brewing storm..."

A plot by the Lapua Movement to create mass instability throughout [Root.GetNameDef] and seize power, thereby proclaiming an independent [Root.GetAdjective] nation, was recently foiled by the state.\n\nKurt Martti Wallenius, known leader of the Lapua Movement, was arrested and the party itself forced to disband. Many prominent leaders, who were able to avoid retribution, have went into hiding. Amongst them was Vilho Annala, who has seen fit to create a similar party to the Lapua Movement, the Patriotic People’s Movement."

While Otto Wille Kuusinen, leader of the Red Guard, was able to avoid capture by the secret police and is still on the hunt, the Red Guard itself has been disbanded, with many of its former members forced to go underground. As for the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation, many of their members, amongst them prominent socialists who had caused much trouble for [Root.GetNameDef] were also arrested.

Currently clashing with the Jägers, the White Guard who have chosen to join the Lapua Movement seem to be gaining the upper hand against the dwindling number of elite light infantry. King [Root.GetLeader] and the rest of the democratic parties are extremely worried about these turn of events. Indeed, General Kurt Martti Wallenius, who is overseeing the current battle, has continually decried the, ‘[GER.GetAdjective] encroachment upon Finland’ in an attempt to boost the morale of the men under his command.

This had put them at odds with the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation, who wished to control the increasingly radicalised paramilitary units.\n\nHowever, neither of the sides within the [Root.GetAdjective] Civil War were able to make a move as, in 1918, the combined White Guard and [GER.GetAdjective] forces were able to defeat the socialists and assume control of the nation.\n\nForced with no other option, those who belonged to the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation and the Red Guard, and who were not arrested, were forced to flee to the then-Bolshevik led Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the formal surrender by the Bolsheviks in 1920, the Red Guard and the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Delegation were forced to relocate to Finland, hiding underground.

However, Kurt Martti Wallenius, who himself had been a part of the battalion, is not a supporter of such a purge and argues that getting rid of the military’s best men would only weaken the state of the [Root.GetAdjective] Army.\n\nWith this in mind, the best course of action would be to..."

finland.59.d:0 "It is clear that we must take to expanding the role of the State Police, so as to allow the detection of activities deemed as stirring up dissent and, hopefully, end such activities before they can take hold on the nation and gain widespread influence amongst the people.\n\nAs such, King [Root.GetLeader] has seen fit to increase the budget and powers of the State Police while also delegating day to day matters to intelligence ministers within his cabinet. The increase in funding has allowed for the investigation office of the State Police to employ a greater amount of employees while also allowing them to test out new methods to deal with any sort of dissidents and protect [Root.GetNameDef]’s internal security. This has, of course, not been popular with large segments of the population, who view the measure as both excessive and totalitarian..."
finland.59.a:0 "It is for the greater good."

finland.60.t:0 "Stabilising [Root.GetName]"
finland.60.d:0 "Despite having managed to successfully take and consolidate power, for now, it is clear that Mannerheim has much to do with regards to the stability of the nation. While the radicals on both the left and the right no longer pose a credible threat, the [Root.GetAdjective] people remain unsure about the new government and its goals for [Root.GetName].\n\nIn order to clear up most of the uncertainty, Mannerheim has openly stated that his goal is to bring back stability to [Root.GetName] while ensuring both peace and prosperity for the nation."
finland.60.a:0 "Admirable."

finland.61.t:0 "The Constitution of [Root.GetName]"
finland.61.d:0 "Working tirelessly with several former and current government officials, legal and constitutional experts, and members of his inner circle, Mannerheim has been working on the creation for a new [Root.GetAdjective] constitution, so as to lay the foundation for a solid and stable [Root.GetName].\n\nIncluded in the constitution is the strengthening of parliament as the strongest organ of the government, the official abolition of the monarchy, provisions regarding human rights, justice, international relations, and the administration of the nation.\n\nWith so many experts having written the constitution, and the [Root.GetAdjective] people in favour of legitimising [Root.GetName]’s newfound status in the world, it is no surprise that, earlier today, the constitution passed with flying colours, with parliament unanimously ratifying it. It’s effects, however, remain to be seen..."
finland.61.a:0 "Wonderful!"

finland.62.t:0 "Unifying the People"
finland.62.d:0 "So as to not allow our efforts to go to waste, it is key that we bridge the gaps left over by the [Root.GetAdjective] Civil War alongside coercing the [Root.GetAdjective] people to put aside their ideological differences in order to truly come together and make [Root.GetName] a great and prosperous nation. While the task of doing so is certainly one that requires dedication and compassion, it is clear that Mannerheim embodies those traits and wishes to empower the nation and its people."

finland.63.d:0 "In order to garner worldwide support for their newfound independence, it seems as though the [FIN.GetAdjective] government under [FIN.GetLeader] has pushed for establishing ties with our nation.

finland.68.d:0 "The [GER.GetAdjective] have declined to provide us with the necessary arms needed to bolster our military, having cited a weapons shortage as of late.

While it is very much true that the light cruisers themselves belong to an older class, it is also true that they served us well during the Weltkrieg.

finland.71.d:0 "The [GER.GetAdjective] delegation have come to us with poor news: apparently, they will not sell us the light cruisers we so desire in, citing a shortage of naval ships at the moment.

finland.123.d:0 "The Finnish government has been watching the development of our union of Nordic nations with keen interest. Today we have received their formal application to join the federation as a constituent state."
finland.123.a:0 "Another Nordic nation joins the herd!"
finland.123.b:0 "We are a Germanic Federation and we intend to keep it that way!"

finland.124.t:0 "Our Application Was Rejected!"
finland.124.d:0 "We have received word from Göteborg that our application to join the Nordic Federation has been rejected. It appears that the member states have rejected letting in our nation on the grounds that we are not of Germanic culture like them."
finland.124.a:0 "When can we have Lappland before it ruins their Germanic Purity?!"

finland.125.t:0 "Civil War in Russia"
finland.125.d:0 "Once more, the Russian bear is at war with itself, and unlike last time, we are not in a civil war ourself. Voices in Helsinki are whispering that this could prove to be the prime opportunity to move into Karelia and liberate our Karelian brethren from the Russian yoke! Others warn caution however, such an act of bravado is unlikely to receive German support."
finland.125.a:0 "To arms!"
finland.125.b:0 "This is not the right time!"

finland.126.t:0 "The Finnish Invasion of Karelia"
finland.126.d:0 "Disaster! Witnessing the socialist uprising, the Finns have taken advantage of our distraction and started an invasion of Karelia, which they claim should rightfully be part of their nation on the basis that the Karelians are closely related to the Finns."
finland.126.a:0 "This violation of our sovereignty can only mean war!"
finland.126.b:0 "We'll deal with them after we got the homefront under control!"

finland.127.t:0 "The Russians Retreat!"
finland.127.d:0 "As our forces moved into Karelia, the Russian forces retreated. Apparently they recognized that a conflict with us isn't something they can afford while their homeland is under the reign of the scarlet flag."
finland.127.a:0 "Hurrah!"

finland.128.t:0 "The Death of Fredrik Kaarle I"
finland.128.d:0 "Our beloved king, Fredrik Kaarle I of Finland, has passed away as a result of an infection on a wound from the first Weltkrieg at age 72, leaving the Finnish throne vacant. In his place his second eldest surviving son prince Wolfgang shall rise to the throne, taking on the regnal name Väinö I at his coronation in the Helsinki Cathedral, where the Finnish crown will for the first time be worn by someone other than his father, as had been agreed upon in 1919 when he came along with his father as crown prince of Finland in the stead of his elder brother prince Philipp, who remained in Germany."
finland.128.a:0 "The king is dead! Long live the king!"

finland.130.t:0 "Finland and the Reichspakt"
finland.130.d:0 "Finland has unofficially been allied with Germany since 1917, and they have been part of Mitteleuropa ever since. However, now that they have stabilized their government, their membership in the Reichspakt should be renewed."
finland.130.a:0 "Welcome back!"
finland.130.b:0 "We have no need of the Finns."

finland.131.t:0 "Germany Rejects Us"
finland.131.d:0 "The Germans have refused to renew our alliance in the Reichspakt! This is extremely unexpected and worrying."
finland.131.a:0 "What's going on in Berlin, anyway?"

finland.132.t:0 "Germany Renews Our Alliance"
finland.132.d:0 "The German Foreign Office, observing that we have stabilized our government after a period of upheaval, has re-extended the hand of friendship to our nation. We are part of the Reichspakt once more."
finland.132.a:0 "Our security is assured."

### Ideas ###
FIN_mounting_dissent_idea:0 "Mounting Dissent"
FIN_mounting_dissent_idea_desc:0 "The Finnish people have been witness to the rapid German influence that has proliferated throughout the nation ever since the establishment of the Kingdom of Finland in 1918 following the victory of the White Guard in the Civil War. This influence can be seen in the form of treaties, German companies in the private sector, German-made weaponry, and the king himself, who is of German descent. As a result, the Finnish people have slowly begun to resent the increasingly tightening grip the German juggernaut has had on the kingdom, resulting in dissent which threatens to boil over at any moment."
FIN_ukrainian_grain_imports_idea:0 "Ukrainian Grain Imports"
FIN_ukrainian_grain_imports_idea_desc:0 "Finland, being that its lands are rather poor for the cultivation of certain types of grass, has been forced to rely upon the nation of Ukraine for grain imports so as to avoid being faced with a lack of food for its people. And while Ukraine is often referred to as the ‘breadbasket of Europe’ and possesses the resource in abundance, our reliance upon their grain is uncertain at best as unforeseen future circumstances could force the nation to slow down or halt grain shipments entirely, leaving us in a dire situation."

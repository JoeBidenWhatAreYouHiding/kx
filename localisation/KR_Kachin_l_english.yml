### Focuses ###

KAC_The_Provisional_Government: "The Liberation Front"
KAC_The_Provisional_Government_desc: "The Jingpho nation is heterogenous but has always pulled together in times of trouble. We must bring co-ethnics who may not completely share our political views into the administration."
KAC_Mobilization_of_Kachin: "The Mobilization of Kachin"
KAC_Mobilization_of_Kachin_desc: "So much of Kachin is isolated from the wider world. We must direct state resources to informing the people of the present situation and the dire need for popular support."
KAC_Uniting_the_Factions: "Uniting the Factions"
KAC_Uniting_the_Factions_desc: "With competing political factions at least partially placated in the pursuit of national liberation, we should use our primacy to encourage them to work together. The Jingpho people will at last be unified in purpose."
KAC_One_State_Under_the_Sun: "One State Under the Sun"
KAC_One_State_Under_the_Sun_desc: "Traditional systems of government organise the lives of many particularly rural people. These administrations must be brought under our direct control."
KAC_The_Father_of_Kachin: "The Father of Kachin"
KAC_The_Father_of_Kachin_desc: "Sama Duwa Sinwa Naw is the great force around which the liberation movement orbits. We should encourage a lofty image of him among the people."
KAC_Eliminate_Chinese_Influence: "Eliminate Chinese Influence"
KAC_Eliminate_Chinese_Influence_desc: "Chinese traders and landowners dominate the national economy and have wide swaths of the population under their boot. We should expropriate their assets and send them all packing."
KAC_An_End_to_the_Fight: "Independence At Last"
KAC_An_End_to_the_Fight_desc: "The state has been established, the people rallied to the cause, and the Chinese stranglehold on the economy destroyed. The forces of Yunnan grow wary of a war for which they have little still to gain. We should contact their officers and arrange for a ceasefire."
KAC_On_the_Offensive: "On the Offensive"
KAC_On_the_Offensive_desc: "To win, to secure our state, we must attack, officials in our new government must be made fully aware of the necessity of an offensive mindset in all things."
KAC_Open_Up_the_Arsenals: "Opening Up the Arsenals"
KAC_Open_Up_the_Arsenals_desc: "Myitkyina is home to dozens of small workshops capable of small arms production. They should be organised and put to the task."
KAC_Cult_of_Industry: "Cult of Industry"
KAC_Cult_of_Industry_desc: "To secure our independence in the long run, we must begin to adapt modern means of production. Luckily some of the small workshops of Myitkyina are relatively sophisticated and can be retrofitted with modern tooling from abroad."

KAC_The_Jingpho_Army: "The Jingpho Military"
KAC_The_Jingpho_Army_desc: "If we are to have any chance of success on the battlefield, we must have a real national army of career soldiers and a core operational doctrine."
KAC_Sabaw_Tus_Plan: "Sabaw Tu's Plan"
KAC_Sabaw_Tus_Plan_desc: "The Jingpho nation is decentralized and our land is rugged. Sabaw Tu advocates an unorthodox doctrine and system of organisation to suit these realities."

KAC_Enforce_Conscription: "Enforce Conscription"
KAC_Enforce_Conscription_desc: "Our land is rugged and rural. As a result, actually enforcing conscription is difficult. A concerted state effort is needed to ensure compliance."
KAC_Guerilla_Fighters: "Guerilla Fighters"
KAC_Guerilla_Fighters_desc: "We lack modern matierl and the great palaces of industry which fuel modern armies. The tenacity of the people and their familiarity with the land shall be our saving grace. We must focus on rousing the people to fight according to their own methods."
KAC_The_Mountainwalkers: "The Mountain-walkers"
KAC_The_Mountainwalkers_desc: "Within the heteregenous Jingpho are men who live as one with the mountains. The most educated of these men should be brought into the command structure in an advisory role."
KAC_A_Streamlined_Training_System: "A Streamlined Training System"
KAC_A_Streamlined_Training_System_desc: "Currently, units are trained until felt 'ready' by instructors. We should introduce a set standard for readyness and basic examinations that all recruits must pass."
KAC_Encourage_Military_Production: "Encourage Military Production"
KAC_Encourage_Military_Production_desc: "With many small facilities now experienced in producing and modifying small arms, that expertise can collected and distributed to villages across the land. While what can be produced in a small village will be quite rudimentary, it is better than nothing."
KAC_Standardized_Equipment: "Standardized Equipment"
KAC_Standardized_Equipment_desc: "We have to make due with what few firearms we have. Luckily, many firearms use similar calibres and rechambering of the small number we possess can be accomplished fairly easily."
KAC_Die_for_Your_Country: "Die For Your Country"
KAC_Die_for_Your_Country_desc: "A decentralised fighting force relies on the tenacity of its men. Our men must be the most fierce of all. We should direct state resources to encouraging a near fanatic devotion to duty and offer compensation to widows of those who die honorably to further incentivize such behavior."
KAC_Myitkyina_Military_Academy: "Myitkyina Military Academy"
KAC_Myitkyina_Military_Academy_desc: "Modern armies possess central institutions for doctrinal development and the training of new officers. We must have one of our own."

KAC_A_Concentrated_Force: "A Concentrated Force"
KAC_A_Concentrated_Force_desc: "Our new divisional structure should be reorganised according to a European model. As many are familiar with how the British once organised their colonial units in Burma, that should be our standard."
KAC_Modern_Tactics: "Modern Tactics"
KAC_Modern_Tactics_desc: "With organizational reform accomplished, we can now begin to adapt these units to warfare as understood by westerners. Through careful planning and modern organisation, any foe can be overcome."
KAC_Elite_Mountaineer_Corps: "Elite Mountaineer Corps"
KAC_Elite_Mountaineer_Corps_desc: "Given our rugged terrain, specially trained mountaineers should be embedded within every division, providing drilling and expertise to their fellow men as much as fighting."
KAC_Fortifying_the_Mountains: "Fortifying the Mountains"
KAC_Fortifying_the_Mountains_desc: "With peace at hand and a growing modern army, we can fortify the eastern frontier, from which invasion after invasion has historically come. The mountainous terrain there naturally suits a defensive to boot."

KAC_disorg_army: "Abyssmal Armaments"
KAC_disorg_army_desc: "Brutal past initiatives to reduce the proliferation of firearms among the Jingpho and geographic isolation have contributed to a massive dearth of materiel for the new Jingpho army. Many new 'regulars' in the army are equipped with little more than modified farming tools."
KAC_disorg_army_2: "Abyssmal Armaments"
KAC_disorg_army_2_desc: "Brutal past initiatives to reduce the proliferation of firearms among the Jingpho and geographic isolation have contributed to a massive dearth of materiel for the new Jingpho army. Many new 'regulars' in the army are equipped with little more than modified farming tools."
KAC_villageguns: "Village Gunsmiths"
KAC_villageguns_desc: "Information about the production of modern armaments has been distributed across the nation and villages encouraged to produce their own copies of firearms used by national army. While guns produced in such such villages are quite rudimentary, they are good enough."

### Events ###

kachin.1.t: "A Formal Army"
kachin.1.d: "The need for a central doctrine to govern the new army is clear. There is disagreement, however, about what that doctrine should be."
kachin.1.a: "Go with Sabaw Tu"
kachin.1.b: "Support Agu Di"

kachin.2.t: "Failure In Kachin"
kachin.2.d: "The political situation in Kachin has deteriorated and little military progress has been made. As such, our officers in the field seem to have agreed to a ceasefire with only the most limited of ascent. The fighting has stopped and with our economic interests in Kachin destroyed, there is little justification to restart the conflict."
kachin.2.a: "Humiliating!"

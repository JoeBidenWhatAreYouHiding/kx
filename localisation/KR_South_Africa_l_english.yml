### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JAMES_HERTZOG_DESC:0 "James Barry Munnik Hertzog first rose to prominence as a Boer guerrilla leader in the second Anglo-Boer war; defiant to the last, he resisted the British long after the war had been definitively lost. Even in defeat, however, Hertzog continued to champion the Afrikaner people. He rose to leadership of the Afrikaner dominated 'National Party', and in 1924, became South Africa's first Nationalist prime minister in coalition with Labour. With the collapse of the United Kingdom the following year, Hertzog was confronted with the fact that he did not have the parliamentary majority to take South Africa out of the Empire, but managed to assume stewardship of the High Commissioner Territories. Hertzog, now as State President of the new South African Republic, has been a proponent of segregation between South Africa's various racial groups, and has encouraged the disenfranchisement and resettlement of South Africa's already oppressed black population."
POLITICS_JAN_SMUTS_DESC:0 "Jan Christiaan Smuts, though an Afrikaner veteran of the Second Boer-War, had, by the onset of the Weltkrieg, become a staunch proponent of South African autonomy within the British Empire. During the Weltkrieg, Smuts led South Africa's armies against the Germans in Namibia and clashed with the famous Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck in East Africa. In defeat, Smuts continued for South Africa's future; while he was temporarily swept out of power in 1924 by the National Party, who wanted to break with Britain permanently, he was back in charge in 1929. He has been fighting for South Africa's alliance with the Entente for his entire career, and it does not appear he is about to give up."
POLITICS_KING_EDWARD_SAF_DESC:0 "Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_NICOLAAS_HAVENGA_DESC:0 "Nicolaas Christiaan Havenga, once a loyal supporter of the James Hertzog and the National Party, and perhaps an even more radical Afrikaner nationalist, left the party over disagreements with its economic policies. He founded the 'Afrikaner Party' in opposition to what was, in his view, the regressive economic platform of the National Party. As president, Havenga seeks to deregulate foreign trade and promote the exploitation of South Africa's vast gold deposits."
POLITICS_DANIEL_MALAN_DESC:0 "Daniel François Malan, former editor of the National Party's newspaper, Die Burger, has outmanoeuvred rival James Hertzog to secure dominance of South Africa's nationalist faction. Malan is, even by Afrikaner Nationalist standards, a hard-line proponent of racial segregation and the suppression of South Africa's black population. As State President, Malan strives to transform South Africa into a nation completely by and for the Afrikaner people, and by nearly any means necessary."
POLITICS_HERBERT_STANLEY_DESC:0 "Herbert James Stanley, British-Rhodesian political leader, has become governor-general of Southern Rhodesia. Stanley, an Englishman, seeks to foster even more resilient economic and political ties with Canada, while maintaining Rhodesia's independence."
POLITICS_EARL_CLARENDON_DESC:0 "George Herbert Hyde Villiers, the Right Honourable Earl of Clarendon, previously member of the British Government in Exile in Canada, was appointed Governor-General of South Africa in 1931, taking care of His Majesty's duties in South Africa for him: appointing the cabinet and dissolving parliament if need be. Notably, the earl is also the chief scout of South Africa. Despite the fact that his political wit induces respect, some voice concerns over the fact that South Africa's Governor-General is not a South African..."
POLITICS_PAT_DUNCAN_DESC:0 "Sir Patrick Duncan was born in Scotland in 1870, in a time quite different from now, when Britain still ruled the world. Having emigrated to South Africa in during the Boer War, after which he practiced as an attorney and then joined politics first as a member of the pro-British Unionist Party and then after the merger the South African Party, Duncan is the first South African to citizen to be appointed as Governor-General of the Union. A milestone."
POLITICS_NJ_DE_WET_DESC:0 "Nicolaas Jacobus de Wet was never supposed to be acting Governor-General of South Africa: a judge by profession, he was Chief Justice of the nation when unexpectedly the existing Governor-General, sir Patrick Duncan, passed away. It was ruled that De Wet would do as an acting Officer Administering the Government of South Africa, and as such, De Wet is now both the first Afrikaner and first South African born in South Africa who takes care of His Majesty's duties as Head of State."
POLITICS_ERNEST_JANSEN_DESC:0 "Pushed through on the insistence of the National Party, who were determined to get a 'neutral' Governor-General, of course coming from their own ranks, E.G. Jansen. Jansen, an Afrikaner from Natal, is as such the first Afrikaner and first South African born right here in South Africa who administeres His Majesty's duties as South Africa's Head of State."
POLITICS_JOHANNES_VAN_RENSBURG_DESC:0 "From secretary of former Justice Minister Tielman Roos, to dictator of South Africa. Few will have foreseen how events turned out. Van Rensburg has always been the leader of the most extreme wing of the National Party, speaking of the Afrikaner nation, appealing to the emotion and the religiosity of his audience while not making a secret of his disdain for the democratic system, the British and the supposed threat that the native South African poses to the Afrikaner 'Volk'. And now that he rules South Africa, it is no longer just rhetoric."
POLITICS_JIMMY_LA_GUMA_DESC:0 "James 'Jimmy' Arnold La Guma was born in Bloemfontein, on August 23rd, 1894, to a lower class family of French-Malagasy immigrants, who died shortly after and left James in the care of an uncle in Cape Town. As a coloured man James was not at the bottom of South Africa's racial hierarchy, but his impoverished upbringing nevertheless taught him the grim realities of oppression and inequality. In his boyhood, he participated in the 1906 Cape Town 'Hooligan Riots', where a multiracial protest of workers and local leftist political leaders was repulsed by police and descended into looting and violence. James for his part joined in by stealing bread and handing it out to the protesting workers. Being largely self-educated, he attributed his first thoughts of class consciousness to reading simple works of proletarian literature and by performing labour-intensive, underpaid jobs. He spent the Weltkrieg in British-occupied Sudwestafrika, toiling on the railroads and in German-owned diamond mines. Here he faced blacklists and arrests, thanks to taking up political activities and trying to organise strikes, which resulted in him returning to South Africa in 1920. James set up shop back in Cape Town, joining Clements Kadalie's Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union and was later elected as its Assistant General Secretary. James emerged as the real power behind the ICU's labour organising, whilst Kadalie tinkered with political theory. Later when Kadalie was deported in 1924, James was tasked together with the British Syndicalist William George Ballinger to argue in Kadalie's absence in order to reconcile the far left of the ICU with its moderate, mainly white wing. Though they managed to secure the ICU's loyalty to Kadalie's vision and James was recognised as leader in Kadalie's absence, the fight over the ICU had a profound effect on James and led him to seriously reconsider the role whites should play in organising the South African labour movement. He began to privately muse that white workers, aware that their privilege always rested on the exploitation of the black proletariat, could not be relied upon to support any revolutionary initiative. James soon forged closer ties with other so-called 'Africanists' on the radical left who shared this sentiment, such as Albert Nzula and J.T. Gumede. In 1935 he started the exclusively black and coloured National Liberation League. Later, these loyal militants would go on to serve as his own political shock troops in the turbulent days of the Second Rand Revolt."
POLITICS_CLEM_KADALIE_DESC:0 "Clements Kadalie was born with the native name Lameck Koniwaka Kadali Muwamba in the British colony of Nyasaland, in April 1896, to a minor chiefly family. His father and uncle's influence helped secure him entrance to a missionary school, where he turned out to be an exemplary student. At age 16, he was granted a position as a teacher to a minor village school in Nyasaland, but after a year he decided to seek employment as a clerk instead. This eventually brought him to Cape Town, where he first started going by the anglicised name 'Clements Kadalie'. There he met and befriended the white trade unionist Arthur F. Batty and together they joined forces to found a multiethnic trade union, which was dubbed the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union. Clements became known as the 'Father of Black Trade Unionism' in South Africa and gained a great deal of fame after he and Batty led a dockworkers strike in 1919, an experience that brought them in touch with other leaders of the labour movement, such as James La Guma and Sidney Bunting. As La Guma gained a greater role within the ICU, Clements started focusing his efforts on studying political theory and writing for the ICU's newspaper, 'Black Man', where he wove together Syndicalist ideas with Pan-Africanism and a religious rhetoric steeped in Garveyism and Ethiopianism.\n\nAs a consequence of his political activism, Clements was deported from South Africa in 1924 and left for Britain, right as the British Revolution began. He soon produced firsthand accounts of the revolution's struggles and offered a spirited defence of British Syndicalism to his peers back in South Africa. Yet in time, he grew disaffected with the African diaspora in Britain and its domination by the Anglican faith. Even though Clements was himself a Presbyterian with strong ties to the Ethiopianist movement, he imagined the need for a post-religious society after the revolution, and eventually packed his bags for Paris where the socio-political culture of Laicism suited him better.After garnering ties with Francophone African radicals, he helped provide input on the future of the ICU, laying out proposals for how the union could continue to operate in his absence and adapt to new circumstances. La Guma and other followers thus helped to promote the multi-ethnic Syndicalist wing of the ICU, against the 'Parallel Unionism' of the white moderates, winning over indecisive members and helping to calm tensions within the union.\n\nClements himself became the ICU's main representative to the Internationale, keeping a steady watch on his home continent, even in exile, awaiting the spark that could lead to a grand workers uprising, as had happened in France and Britain."
POLITICS_DAVE_JONES_DESC:0 "David Ivon Jones was born in 1883 in Aberystwyth, Wales to a prominent family of Welsh radicals. His grandfather John Jones had been a champion of Welsh rural liberalism and a participant in the religious Nonconformist movement, which heavily affected David growing up. Though initially following in his grandfather's footsteps and taking up the cause of Welsh nationalism, David contracted tuberculosis in his early 20s, a disease that has continued to haunt him for his entire life. After being recommended to move to a drier climate in order to convalesce, David first packed his bags for New Zealand and later in 1909 migrated to South Africa, where he settled in the Witwatersrand. There he witnessed the social and economic inequality that plagued the South African miners, as well as the racial divides in the labour movement. He concluded that both white and black labourers were treated as slaves, but he put a particular emphasis on how downtrodden and mistreated the blacks were, abandoned and spat on by white workers who could have been their comrades. Motivated by Christian Unitarianism, along with his moralist and nascent socialist views, David proclaimed that the South African worker would have to 'fight for human rights, whether for the coloured or white people'. He encouraged the growth of black trade unions and class consciousness among black and coloured workers, dabbling in a wide variety of political groups such as the Labour Party, the pacifist 'War on War League' and the brief all-black trade union known as the Industrial Workers of Africa. He ultimately settled as a member of the International Socialist League, becoming its General Secretary. Yet David’s sickly body struggled to handle the immense workload that he put on himself, and after contracting malaria in addition to his tuberculosis he briefly resigned his position and underwent both a spiritual and health crisis, departing South Africa for France in 1920.\n\nHis love of Christ and Socialism was eventually rekindled in by the fires of the French Syndicalist Revolution, and David chose to rejoin the ISL, being promoted to be one of their representatives to the Third Internationale shortly thereafter. He remained living in Nice for 8 years, eventually recovering to the point where he could travel further distances than up to Paris. His brotherly love for the black worker only grew, as he collaborated with socialists in the French African diaspora to pen his magnum opus, 'Africa Awakening', which declared that 'Every capitalist government is drenched with the blood of the Negro'. During his time in Europe, he also briefly visited the Union of Britain and reunited with the exiled South African black trade unionist Clements Kadalie, helping to solidify the political alliance between the ISL and the ICU. Eventually in 1928, David felt he was physically strong and mentally prepared enough to return to South Africa, with his friend and mentor Sidney Bunting arranging passage for him to Johannesburg, where he has been active ever since. Though he is no longer General Secretary in the ISL, he remains an active propagandist and spokesman for pacifism and the rights of Black and coloured labourers."
POLITICS_KOTANE_DESC: "Moses Mauane Kotane was born on August 9th, 1905 in the Transvaal town of Pella, to a Black literate family belonging to the Tswana peoples. Despite his father being a Lutheran preacher, young Moses received little formal schooling as a child and as the second oldest son among eleven siblings was expected to find work at an early age, to help provide for the family. As a teenager, he initially found employment as a farmworker and was paid primarily in livestock that was given to his family. By the time he finally entered school, Moses was far behind his fellow students and grew increasingly confrontational with his teachers, who he believed were unqualified and did not properly nurture his talents. In 1924 he moved to Johannesburg and worked a variety of jobs, eventually joining the ANC and the ICU's trade unions. With backing from his fellow trade unionist Albert Nzula, Moses was soon elected as vice-chair of a national trade union conference and introduced to the wider world of the black, white and coloured intelligentsia in South Africa. He grew close to the ISL, particularly the clique surrounding Sidney Bunting, David Ivon Jones and Eddie Roux, who were greatly sympathetic to encouraging black membership in the South African labour movement. He also briefly flirted with Africanist, nativist ideas due to Nzula's influence, but ultimately feared that black nationalism would lead to racial chauvinism and tribal animosity, endangering the carefully maintained alliances between blacks and coloureds. Moses went on to serve as a typesetter and Setswana translator for various socialist newspapers under Roux' editorship.\n\nBy the 1930s, Moses packed his bags for Cape Town in an attempt to build a new political following away from the socialist leadership in Johannesburg, but also to slip beneath the South African government's notice, forging secret alliances with coastal trade unions. This paid off after the socialist revolution, as these unions elected Moses as a key member of the new ISL government, eventually paving the way for him to take over as David Ivon Jones' successor, serving as a young, charismatic, black leader of the nation's socialist movement."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_HENRY_ANDREWS_DESC:0 "William Henry Andrews, commonly known as 'Bill' Andrews or just 'Comrade Bill' was born in Suffolk, England, on the 20th March, 1870. After dropping out of school at the tender age of 13, Bill drifted between jobs and eventually received training as a mechanical fitter. He took to trade unionism early on, joining the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. By 1893 he secured steady employment on a railroad in South Africa, choosing to immigrate to what was then the Transvaal Colony. Bill then spent the better part of two decades on the Rand frontier and in the city of Johannesburg, toiling on the railroads or in the Gold mines and for a brief time serving in the British army during the 2nd Boer War. He recognised the desperate need for an organised labour movement that could fight back against the local 'Randlords' who dominated the colony, slowly but surely spreading the influence of the ASE and eventually rising up countless local trade union federations and trades and labour councils. By 1909 he took a greater interest in parliamentary politics, recognizing the change that the Act of Union would mark, so Bill helped to found the all-white South African Labour Party and elected as an MP on their ticket.\n\nVery soon however, Bill became opposed to the party's segregationist agenda and their endorsement of the British war effort in the Weltkrieg. He went on to help found the ISL, beginning to formulate an idea of 'parallel unionism' that would calm racial tensions on the South African left by allowing whites to operate one set of unions, whilst the blacks, coloureds and other minority would operate a parallel union.The promise of blacks and whites being 'separate but equal' was one which was often flaunted and disregarded, Bill knew that much, but he genuinely believed then and still does that this plan is the only way to create racial harmony in South Africa. Parallel unionism was never formally added to the ISL's political platform, though Bill did help codify it as a popular policy within the South African Trades Union Congress after he was elected as the trade union federation's first General Secretary in 1924. Few expected a radical like Bill would head up the SATUC but he won an undisputed majority of the votes and beat out Frederic Creswell, Minister of Labour in the Hertzog government. Bill continued to remain influential within the SATUC's successor, the SATLC.\n\nThanks to this political influence, to say nothing of his legendary reputation as a Syndicalist populist, Comrade Bill has become Chairman Andrews, the first provisional leader of a new socialist South Africa, where he will be forced to thread the needle between tense factional politics, economic collapse and racial tensions."

SAF_establish_nuweveld:0 "Establish the Nuweveld"
SAF_establish_nuweveld_desc:0 "Turning the newly annexed territories over to white settlers will encourage the establishment of new settlements throughout the Nuweveld and the cultural integration of the new regions.

SAF_encourage_farmer_resettlement_desc:0 "The financial plight of our farmers presents us with a unique opportunity to apply the Nuweveldt project.

SAF_stellaland_affairs_act:0 "Stellaland Affairs Act"
SAF_stellaland_affairs_act_desc:0 "The integration of the former Protectorates will require formal, albeit mostly symbolic legislation.

SAF_develop_bechuanaland:0 "Develop Bechuanaland"
SAF_develop_bechuanaland_desc:0 "The sparsely populated region of Bechuanaland is without hyperbolics the least developed region in all of Africa, with any kind of construction remaining limited to a few wooden huts in most places. A series of well-placed investments will soften the contrast with South Africa just over the border."
SAF_root_out_slavery:0 "Root Out Slavery Practices"
SAF_root_out_slavery_desc:0 "Slavery has long proven difficult to root out of the High Commissioner Territories, but the recent investment gives us leverage with the paramount chiefs to resolve the persisting issues, by making investments dependent on their action on slavery."
SAF_question_of_native_autonomy:0 "Question of Native Autonomy"
SAF_question_of_native_autonomy_desc:0 "We have decided to grant autonomy to the local rulers of the High Commission Territories, the new Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs power - is it limited to within the borders of the HCT or does it encompass all of their peoples throughout South Africa?"
SAF_strengthen_advisory_councils:0 "Strengthen the Advisory Councils"
SAF_strengthen_advisory_councils_desc:0 "By strengthening the influence of the advisory councils on policy, we can assure that the interests of the Paramount Chief is at least somewhat balanced with both the European and native interests. It will also lay the groundwork for eventual reform into a bona fide democratic framework in the future."
SAF_chief_justice_of_the_high_commissioner_territories:0 "Form the Territorial Justice System"
SAF_chief_justice_of_the_high_commissioner_territories_desc:0 "At current the status of the law in the High Commissioner Territories is rather vague, members of the tribes are usually tried according to their own tribal traditions while Europeans are tried as if they were in South African territory, with certain exceptions. It is time we formalise a system with trained justices specifically to ensure fair trials for everyone in the territories."
SAF_reform_the_commissioner_system:0 "Reform the Commissioner System"
SAF_reform_the_commissioner_system_desc:0 "We have made our fair investments in the High Commissioner Territories, but at current we still merely have a temporary mandate from the royal government.

SAF_replace_the_pound:0 "Replace the Pound"
SAF_replace_the_pound_desc:0 "Since we are now a fully sovereign and independent nation, it will not do any longer to make use of a currency intrinsically tied to a British past and tied to the Pound Sterling. Let us introduce our own South African Rand - tied to the Witwatersrand, where we find our gold - and thrive in our independent future."
SAF_reorganise_the_national_party:0 "Reorganize the National Party"
SAF_reorganise_the_national_party_desc:0 "Dr. Malan, the pathetic constitutionalist barrister, is allowing our Afrikaner destiny to be held back with this insistence to adhere to the South African constitution, binding us to worthless parliamentary procedures and endangering our nation's hold on power in South Africa in the process.

SAF_independent_perspective_desc:0 "We are a free and independent country now, not beholden to the will of Britain to sacrifice Afrikaner men to reverse their own failures at home, or to bully our German brethren, who have never done us wrong. Yet, as an independent South Africa pursuing South African interests, we are not against allies."
SAF_retreat_from_european_affairs:0 "Retreat from European Affairs"
SAF_retreat_from_european_affairs_desc:0 "General Smuts dragged us into the Weltkrieg, sending Afrikaners to die in the cold mud of a land alien to their own to further the imperial interest of an island that was not their own either. Now that South Africa is a free and independent country, we will cease to involve ourselves in the petty squabbles of the European powers."
SAF_native_representation_act:0 "The Native Representation Act"
SAF_native_representation_act_desc:0 "A long-term Nationalist goal has been to remove native South Africans from the voting rolls and to allow them to vote for three separate white members of the Volksraad instead of pooling their property-qualified vote into South Africa's general electorate. The time to implement this plan is now!"
SAF_gerrymander_districts:0 "Gerrymander the Districts"
SAF_gerrymander_districts_desc:0 "Troublingly, we are having trouble in getting a majority of the electorate to support us, and we mainly owe our hold over the government to the fact that rural constituencies are overrepresented compared to urban constituencies. Perhaps if we slightly redraw the borders, we can ensure this situation remains locked down in our favour."
SAF_flags_amendment_act:0 "Flags Amendment Act"
SAF_flags_amendment_act_desc:0 "It is the result of compromise that South Africa, proud nation as it is, needs to fly the Union Jack, a symbol of oppression by Britain, next to its national flag in official capacity. This act will ensure that our national flag will no longer see competition from the British national flag."
SAF_expel_rensburg_pirow:0 "Expel Johannes van Rensburg"
SAF_expel_rensburg_pirow_desc:0 "The power-hungry and paramilitary former administrator of the Orange Free State, Johannes van Rensburg, has been plotting to unconstitutionally seize the apparatus of state for himself for years now. It is time we distance ourselves from this shady figure by revoking his party membership."
SAF_coloured_enfranchisement_act:0 "'Coloured' Enfranchisement Act"
SAF_coloured_enfranchisement_act_desc:0 "Of all racial groups in South Africa, the mixed race 'Coloured' group is definitely the one seen as the closest to an equal by the South Africa's white European population. The first step towards gradually turning South Africa in a truly comprehensive democracy would be to abolish the property qualifications of this community in the Cape and Rhodesia, while extending franchise to them in the other provinces."
SAF_native_trust_and_land_act:0 "Native Trust and Land Act"
SAF_native_trust_and_land_act_desc:0 "The Native Trust and Land Act increases the designated 8% of South African land which has been reserved for South Africa's native population to approximately 13% of South Africa's territory. This measure will mean that land currently owned by whites will have to be bought by the government, a process that can take years, if not decades."
SAF_asiatic_land_tenure_act:0 "Asiatic Land Tenure Act"
SAF_asiatic_land_tenure_act_desc:0 "Conservatives within our party, especially those based in Natal, consider that Indian merchants are posing a threat to the white community by outcompeting their stores, both among whites and natives. They would like to ensure that white South Africans can secure their position by limiting the land which can be owned by Indians to certain designated areas."
SAF_natives_consolidation_act:0 "Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act"
SAF_natives_consolidation_act_desc:0 "For a long time, we have been using pass laws to prevent native South Africans from encroaching on our urban areas, which are inhabited by white South Africans. The following act has been proposed by the conservatives to refine the pass laws and ensure that the privileged position of the urban whites can be maintained."
SAF_vaalhart_irrigation_scheme:0 "Complete the Vaalhart Irrigation Scheme"
SAF_vaalhart_irrigation_scheme_desc:0 "The Orange Free State, Northern Cape and Transvaal regions of South Africa are quite dry and therefore less suitable for agriculture. By building an extensive irrigation system out of the Vaal river we can ensure that our farms receive enough water for a good output of agricultural produce."
SAF_expand_krugerpark:0 "Expand the Krugerpark"
SAF_expand_krugerpark_desc:0 "The Krugerpark is a wildlife reserve with its roots in the Sabi Game Reserve of the South African Republic (commonly known as the (boer republic of) Transvaal). In recent years it has attracted a modest amount of tourism from both the English and German spheres of influence who seem enthousiastic about the wildlife rail tours through the national park."
SAF_enact_smuts_doctrine:0 "Recover British Africa"
SAF_enact_smuts_doctrine_desc:0 "In the darkest hour of the empire, the revolution of 1925, the vile Germans illegally occupied most of British Africa, only leaving alone South Africa, the High Commisioner Territories, Gambia and Sierra Leone. Generals Pierre van Ryneveld and Jan Smuts have put together a plan to bring back at least the relatively easily accessible colonies of Northern Rhodesia and East Africa in the imperial fold."
SAF_fire_broeders:0 "Fire 'Broeder' Civil Servants"
SAF_fire_broeders_desc:0 "The Afrikaner Broederbond, a secret society of Afrikaners, posing as a cultural organisation encompassing many prominent South African politicians, soldiers and civil servants, has sought to push Afrikaner issues and rule South Africa from behind the curtains since its foundation. It is time we curtail the influence of these secretive men by requiring all of our civil servants to distance from them."
SAF_asiatic_enfranchisement_act:0 "Asiatic Enfranchisement Act"
SAF_asiatic_enfranchisement_act_desc:0 "The Asiatic racial group of South Africa, comprised of Cape Malays who have been here since Dutch rule and Indian indentured workers introduced mainly in Natal, but also in the Transvaal and Cape province, form only a small fraction of the South African population, but most of them are currently denied the right to vote under similar conditions as the native majority. It is time to abolish these restrictions."
SAF_found_sabc:0 "Found the SABC"
SAF_found_sabc_desc:0 "Radio broadcasters have been active in South Africa since 1923, but South Africa has so far lacked a national radio network. As such, voices have risen in Pretoria to officially establish a 'South African Broadcasting Corporation', or, in Afrikaans, 'Suid-Afrikaanse Uitsaaikorporasie', which will broadcast two radio services: one in English, and one in Afrikaans."
SAF_fund_stellenbosch:0 "Fund Stellenbosch University"
SAF_fund_stellenbosch_desc:0 "The 'Universiteit Stellenbosch' or the 'Stellenbosch University' is, together with the University of Cape Town, the oldest extant university in sub-saharan Africa. The university, which is certainly the most high profile of the nation, almost exclusively teaches in Afrikaans, and serves as somewhat of an intellectual hub for the National Party. Investing in them will increase our research capability."
SAF_fund_cape_town_uni:0 "Fund the University of the Witwatersrand"
SAF_fund_cape_town_uni_desc:0 "While not quite as classic as the Cape Town and Stellenbosch Universities, the University of Witwatersrand, founded by J.H. Hofmeyr, is certainly innovative. The university is multi-racial and as such (and through its founder), closely associated with the South African Party."
SAF_join_isac:0 "Form the South African Mathematical Society"

SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion:0 "Focus on Agricultural Expansion"
SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion_desc:0 "Our history is rooted in the exploits of the farmers who came to South Africa. It would be foolish to throw our cash into the pockets of the already rich English capitalists, who are ever hungry for workers to exploit, those workers being the Africans when the Afrikaners become too expensive. Agriculture is the strength of our nation and the root of our culture."
SAF_subsidized_farming:0 "Subsidized Farming"
SAF_subsidized_farming_desc:0 "One way to support our hardworking farmers is to hand out subsidies, allowing them to perhaps expand their lands a bit, take better precautions against wildlife aiming to attack their livestock, and investing in new machinery."
SAF_support_cape_wineries:0 "Support Cape Wineries"
SAF_support_cape_wineries_desc:0 "The mediterranean climate of the Cape is perfect for the cultivation of wine grapes, and as such, South African wine is world-renowned. We should make use of this export boon, and support our wineries in their endeavours."
SAF_encourage_sharecropping:0 "Encourage Sharecropping"
SAF_encourage_sharecropping_desc:0 "Sharecropping holds that a landowner allows a tenant to farm on his land in return for a part of the produce. Many Afrikaner farmers are unable to work all of their stretched land of our outstretched nation. It would be economically responsible to encourage them to allow sharecroppers to work this excess land."
SAF_agricultural_innovation:0 "Agricultural Innovation"
SAF_agricultural_innovation_desc:0 "South Africa is a western nation, but also a nation of agriculture. It is only natural that we have are developing a significant edge on agricultural technology compared to other countries, and we can leverage this innovativeness into other fields of Research and Development."
SAF_help_small_farming_communities:0 "Aid Small Farming Communities"
SAF_help_small_farming_communities_desc:0 "When crisis strikes, small farming communities who are unable to offset their goods are often the first victims. It is our responsibility as a government to protect these vulnerable farmers, and we could do that by subsidising their endeavours."
SAF_industrial_farming_equipment:0 "Industrial Farming Equipment"
SAF_industrial_farming_equipment_desc:0 "The Industrial revolution did not only revolutionise industrial efforts but also revolutionised agriculture. We have the means, so we could definitely increase our agricultural efficiency by investing in this kind of machinery."
SAF_granary_of_africa:0 "The Granary of Africa"
SAF_granary_of_africa_desc:0 "Our agricultural achievements have not gone without notice: South African bread is exported through the continent and beyond, feeding colonist and colonial alike. As such, South Africa is quickly becoming known as the Granary of Africa."
SAF_south_african_gold:0 "South Africa's Gold"
SAF_south_african_gold_desc:0 "South Africa has significant gold reserves. The presence of gold means we have the means to back up our currency and it's something other countries desire for a similar goal. It would be foolish not to exploit the money that lies below our soil."
SAF_focus_on_manufacturing:0 "Focus on Industrial Expansion"
SAF_focus_on_manufacturing_desc:0 "In the late 19th century, the industrial revolution has truly taken root in South Africa. The combination of natural resources and manpower to work the factories sets South Africa up perfectly to become an industrial powerhouse, while the rest of the continent still digs through the dirt!"
SAF_director_general_van_der_bijl:0 "Appoint Van der Bijl as Director-General"
SAF_director_general_van_der_bijl_desc:0 "Hendrik van der Bijl, the founder of numerous companies, like the Eskom, our electricity company, and the Iron and Steel Corporation of South Africa (ISCOR), is perfectly suited to make our industrial base ready for wartime production needs."

SAF_form_idc_of_south_africa_desc:0 "The Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa will become a financial institution aiding South Africa's industrial development through the distribution of grants to build certain required industries and contribute to our economic growth, allowing our industry to grow."
SAF_recruit_native_labour:0 "Recruit Native Labour"
SAF_recruit_native_labour_desc:0 "While the Afrikaners and white labourers may resent the encroachment of natives on our industrial zones, the reality is that the white labour pool is simply too small to optimally use the industrial potential of South Africa. With the entire workforce available, we are well on our way to become one of the foremost industrial nations of the world."
SAF_great_repairshop:0 "The Great Repairshop"
SAF_great_repairshop_desc:0 "Our industry has rapidly evolved over the last years to enable us to properly support a long-term war effort. This has been so successful that by now, South Africa is known as the 'Great Repairshop', where our allies' equipment in North Africa, the Middle East and Southern Europe goes when it needs repairing."
SAF_support_iscor_expansion:0 "Support ISCOR Expansion"

SAF_vanderbijlparks_steelworks_desc:0 "Demand for steel is ever increasing. In light of this fact, Director-General Van der Bijl has overseen an ISCOR acquisition of some 100 square kilometers to build a large new steel plant and a model town surrounding it, living off the steel plant in their vicinity. Reportedly, Van der Bijl himself intends to live in the town he is founding."

SAF_post_war_boom:0 "Post-War Boom"
SAF_post_war_boom_desc:0 "The war that encompassed the world has destroyed much of the world, but South Africa was mostly spared. It is only natural then, that the rest of the world is looking towards South Africa for its goods. Export is booming, and because of this, so is South Africa."

SAF_johannesburg_convention:0 "The Johannesburg Convention"
SAF_johannesburg_convention_desc:0 "The foul capitalists have been vanquished and a worker's South Africa has been born. It is time we gather at the heart of the revolution: the city of Johannesburg, where the proletariat has long been toiling, to decide our future. A future that belongs to us!"
SAF_segregation_question:0 "Abolish Formal Segregation"
SAF_segregation_question_desc:0 "Long have the capitalists-imperialists been using simplistic racial rhetoric to convince the white proletarian that his black comrade would be his adversary, allowing them to entrench their own interests and falsifying a sense of need for collaboration by the white worker. It is time we abolish the legislation designed to keep us in their hands."
SAF_herald_syndicate_autonomy:0 "Herald Syndicate Autonomy"
SAF_herald_syndicate_autonomy_desc:0 "While the common catchphrase 'Workers of the world unite!' seems incompatible with the notion of treating certain workers differently from others, the basis of our state are the trade unions, and some of those trade unions want to reserve access to their membership. It is not our place to intervene in that."
SAF_la_guma_administration:0 "The La Guma Administration"
SAF_la_guma_administration_desc:0 "As had been assessed long ago, the white proletariat has shown its true colours: they have developed a bourgeoise sense of superiority, and their 'revolution' unsurprisingly proved to be a farce. It has been long overdue that we cut the English and Dutch out of the government. South Africa for South AFRICANS!"
SAF_land_restitution:0 "Land Restitution"
SAF_land_restitution_desc:0 "The colonisers have driven the South Africans from their land, confining them to a wholly unfulfilling 8% of South African soil, forcing our people into famine and overpopulation in a nation that is more than large enough for our people. We shall take back what was stolen from us, and give it back to the people!"
SAF_native_empowerment_program:0 "Native Empowerment Program"
SAF_native_empowerment_program_desc:0 "The whites, ever anxious to lose their position, have spent their time limiting access to education and training to themselves, leaving us to scrub the floor clean. Unfortunately, this means all the technical expertise is with them. A combination of educational reform and hiring educated blacks over whites shall allow us to take back our destiny!"
SAF_native_republic:0 "The Native Republic"
SAF_native_republic_desc:0 "With the sweeping reforms enacted by La Guma's government, South Africa once again belongs to the South African people, rather than a minority of Europeans pretending a South African identity who lord us around. The Native Republic, belonging to the black South African, is finally a fact."
SAF_outlaw_colour_bars:0 "Outlaw Colour Bars"
SAF_outlaw_colour_bars_desc:0 "Colour Bars, meant to prevent cheaper black workers from replacing white workers, are an outdated concept now. Every South African is a brother to one another in our move towards socialism and the vile profit motive has been quashed. Such discriminatory measures are nothing but shameful and can't be left in place."
SAF_restrict_internal_migration:0 "Restrict Internal Migration"
SAF_restrict_internal_migration_desc:0 "As much as we reject the racially based pass laws of the minority regime, one cannot deny the reality that without any restrictions rural South Africans would swarm Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, overpopulating the townships and living in squalor. It is simply a necessity to control the migration flow, even if it need not be racially based."
SAF_end_all_pass_laws:0 "An End to all Pass Laws"
SAF_end_all_pass_laws_desc:0 "The pass laws of the minority regime have left scars that may never heal on the South African psyche, pushing the vast majority of South Africans away except if they were needed to do the existing inhabitants' dirty work. While it is likely that the abolition of these laws will attract many rural South Africans to the cities in hopes to find opportunity, this move is non-negotiable."
SAF_urban_housing_program:0 "Urban Housing Expansion"
SAF_urban_housing_program_desc:0 "Our loosening of migration restrictions on urban areas has, as could be expected, resulted in a giant inflow from South Africa's less developed rural areas of South Africans looking for new opportunities. Unfortunately our housing facilities can't keep up to the demand and the new migrants live in squalor as a result. The only option left is to build more housing facilities, and building them fast."
SAF_diversify_higher_education:0 "Diversify Higher Education"
SAF_diversify_higher_education_desc:0 "Traditionally our institutions of higher education have been quite hostile to non-white students, preferring to gate themselves off and leaving non-whites little choice but to go to less prestigious education facilities. Now that we are creating a new and more fair South Africa, it is time we motivate our institutions of higher education to make their student base more representative to all South Africa."
SAF_revolution_in_practice:0 "The Revolution in Practice"
SAF_revolution_in_practice_desc:0 "The capitalists have been vanquished, but South Africa has not yet been transformed. Today our work begins to change South Africa for once and for all.

SAF_curtail_counterrevolutionary_activity:0 "Curtail Reactionary Activity"
SAF_curtail_counterrevolutionary_activity_desc:0 "Our enemies are many still: Afrikaner Nationalists are trying to lure our Afrikaner worker base into treason by appealing to their skin complexion. Canada and the exiles from the previous government are plotting a monarchist restoration. Tribal chiefs want to preserve their way of life contrary to our values. We need to suppress them all."
SAF_reform_south_african_police:0 "Reform the South African Police"
SAF_reform_south_african_police_desc:0 "The South African Police has been a strong tool for the previous regime to keep their hold on our nation and to oppress the worker. It is imperative that we reform this rotten institution from the bottom up so that the police force shall defend the population, rather than keep them down."
SAF_control_the_narrative:0 "Seize Control over the Narrative"
SAF_control_the_narrative_desc:0 "The media is the key to the heart of the people. By assuming control over broadcasting institutions throughout South Africa and filtering the capitalist nonsense inserted by partisan journalists out we can ensure that our population will not be seduced by imperialist lies any longer."
SAF_seize_industrial_capital:0 "Seize Our Industrial Capital"
SAF_seize_industrial_capital_desc:0 "Since the discovery of natural resources in the rand and the western Cape, South Africa has steadily grown into possibly the lone industrial state in Africa. Unfortunately, South Africans never benefitted from it. British men in high hats reaped the benefits of the labour of South Africans and gave us a hunger wage. Not anymore: South African industry will benefit South Africans."
SAF_tolerate_small_farming_enterprises:0 "Tolerate Small Farming Enterprises"
SAF_tolerate_small_farming_enterprises_desc:0 "While nothing but our wrath shall be directed to the corporations attempting to monopolise the most precious tenet of a civilisation: the food supply, it would not be fair to deprive small family businesses of their livelihood on this basis. While in a very banal way it does resemble capitalism if one works their land and sells the returns for a tidy profit, on a small scale it is acceptable."
SAF_nationalize_all_farms:0 "Nationalize Our Agrarian Potential"
SAF_nationalize_all_farms_desc:0 "Capitalists have taken our farmlands for themselves and sell food, the most fundamental need of the human being, for profit. It is time we collectivise the agrarian sector, reorganising it into farming cooperatives, in which each farmer works. This will ensure it will stay a fair profession."
SAF_grab_the_mines:0 "Appropriate the Mines"
SAF_grab_the_mines_desc:0 "South Africa's soil is rich: diamonds, gold, coal... It can all be found right there under our feet. But unfortunately, Rhodes and his successors have taken control over them, forcing miners to shed blood, sweat and tears exhuming diamonds for an extremely low wage while they sell them to jewelries in Ottawa for exorbitantly high prices where tea-sipping aristocrats happily wear them. No longer!"
SAF_divide_the_spoils:0 "Divide the Spoils of Class War"
SAF_divide_the_spoils_desc:0 "We have spent our time taking what rightfully belongs to the South African from the international capitalist. Of course, there is pain involved in this business.

SAF_i_see_you:0 "I See You!"
SAF_i_see_you_desc:0 "Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, ICU for short - correctly assessed by a white judge to be pronounced as 'I see you'. The black South African did see the white South African, when he was denied access to sidewalks, beaches and jobs by him. And now, through the ICU's action, for perhaps the first time, the white South African sees him too..."
SAF_organise_natives:0 "Organize Native Unions"
SAF_organise_natives_desc:0 "The black population of South Africa is too a much lesser degree involved in trade unionism.

SAF_encourage_communal_engagement:0 "Inspire Communal Engagement"
SAF_encourage_communal_engagement_desc:0 "Small, often traditionalist communities, are not very inclined to involve themselves into the affairs of the state. But now we are a pluralist nation and we value the engagement of our citizens, so we should work with them to engage them."
SAF_native_education_program:0 "Native Education Program"
SAF_native_education_program_desc:0 "Any and all public education in South Africa had been reserved to whites during the previous regime, relegating black South Africans to the goodwill of missionaries and religious institutions. While the quality was passable, it was unsurprisingly riddled with religiosity, the tool to keep the proletariat in line, too. It is time we open up objective education for non-whites."
SAF_incorporate_saic:0 "Incorporate the SAIC"
SAF_incorporate_saic_desc:0 "To fully ensure the cooperation with the Indian community in South Africa, it is paramount that we incorporate their interest group, the South African Indian Congress, into the government like we did with the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union."
SAF_support_saic:0 "Support the SAIC"

SAF_full_participation_doctrine:0 "Inclusive Participation Doctrine"
SAF_full_participation_doctrine_desc:0 "If we are to succeed as a truly fair and equal nation, we need every racial group to participate. For this reason we have the Inclusive Participation Doctrine: by engaging with our communities and special programs, we can ensure that we are not a government of compassionate whites and black intellectuals while the rest of South Africa is apathetic."
SAF_durban_convention:0 "The Durban Convention"
SAF_durban_convention_desc:0 "We have made tremendous strides in the last few years: the Larneys have been crushed, racial affairs have been made more equitable and South Africa for perhaps the first time since the concept exists, belongs to the South African. Still, there is more work to be done as we pave our road to socialism; and part of that is participation of the public."
SAF_dethrone_the_paramount_chiefs:0 "Dethrone the Paramount Chiefs"

SAF_protectorate_political_development:0 "Political Development in the Protectorates"
SAF_protectorate_political_development_desc:0 "20th century politics in the protectorates is far and few between. To some degree these provinces are still under the tribal authorities from which all mankind stems eventually. Unfortunately, this state of affairs is much less equitable than our socialist system. Through education, we can change this state of affairs."
SAF_bechuanland_autonomous_commune:0 "Establish Bechuanaland Autonomous Commune"
SAF_bechuanland_autonomous_commune_desc:0 "Even if it was beholden to the Paramount Chiefs, the Tswana people have had autonomy over their own affairs since times immemorial, even under British administration. It would not be equitable to deprive them of this, thus the Bechuanaland Autonomous Commune is being drafted, which has the right to pass its own laws devolved from our national government."

### Decisions ###
SAF_reclamation_actions:0 "The African Reclamation Campaign"
SAF_reclamation_actions_desc:0 "Tally-Ho towards destiny, men! We move to retake the old lands of the fallen colonies across Africa for King and Country! We shall cleanse the land of Germanic taint and remove the Hun from the land. The Sun shall rise again on the British Empire..."

SAF_in_Zambia:0 "Restore Responsible Government in Northern Rhodesia"
SAF_in_Zambia_desc:0 "With Northern Rhodesia firmly controlled by Anglo forces, and the last of the Hun bastards dealt with, we may now move forward with setting up a more permanent administration in the region. As long as some of our bureaucrats remain in North Rhodesia to oversee the initial steps, we are confident North Rhodesia will prosper once more."

SAF_in_Namibiland:0 "Restore Responsible Government in Namibiland"
SAF_in_Namibiland_desc:0 "With the former lands of German Südwestafrika firmly controlled by our armies, and the last of the German holdouts being cleared away, our government has allowed for the creation of a permanent administration in the region. Though some in our government have their doubts given the large German minority in the area, we feel as though Namibland is ready for responsible governance...with Anglo oversight of course."

SAF_restoration_actions:0 "Matters of State in the Reclaimed Territories"
SAF_restoration_actions_desc:0 "Our conquests of the former British colonies in Africa have gone off without a hitch. We now control nearly half of the Dark Continent, and now must come the aftermath. With such large swathes of land quickly being conquered and placed under the control of our ever-straining bureaucracy, it is now time to determine what to do with these territories."

SAF_restore_Zambia:0 "Governance of Northern Rhodesia"
SAF_restore_Zambia_desc:0 "With the foundation of a new, Anglo-dominated colony in North Rhodesia, a new face for the colony must be chosen; one free of Germanic corruption. To this end, we must decide on a first Governor-General to lead the colony in these formative years."

SAF_restore_Namibiland:0 "Governance of Namibiland"
SAF_restore_Namibiland_desc:0 "With our conquest of Namibiland and the creation of a new civil administration, the time has come to select a head of state for the new colony. However, with its large German-speaking minority, the list of candidates that wouldn’t further worsen the delicate situation there is rather short. The top candidate is famous South African lawyer Johannes Van Rensburg, who has garnered a great deal of trust with the Namibiland Germans. Perhaps we should approach him."

SAF_in_Tanzania:0 "Restore Responsible Government in Tanganyika"
SAF_in_Tanzania_desc:0 "With Göring’s vile fiefdom being toppled in Tanganyika, Anglo boots finally conquered the heart of German Afrika. Now, with the last of Göring’s venomous influence being burned or shot out of existence, we now have the herculean task of restoring some semblance of reasonable government to this long tortured land. It shall be no easy task, but if anyone can do it, it is the mighty Anglo!"

SAF_restore_Tanzania:0 "Governance of Tanganyika"
SAF_restore_Tanzania_desc:0 "Now that we have created an initial structure of government that the locals will expand on, Tanganyika may now be ready to be ruled from a more local authority. To grant this, a new head of the colonial government of Tanganyika must be chosen, one who shall lead with strength as the colony is rebuilt."

SAF_in_Congo:0 "Intervening in the Congolese civil war"
SAF_in_Congo_desc:0 "News from Leopoldville! It seems the situation there has dissolved past any known peaceful recourse and the nation has devolved into civil war. We must send aid to our ally Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans and help him crush this madness at once!"

SAF_in_Kenya:0 "Intervening in the Mau Mau uprising"
SAF_in_Kenya_desc:0 "Urgent communique from Nairobi! The Mau-Mau uprising is in full swing, and the local Kenyan defense forces have so far been unable to decisively end the threat. With more and more native auxiliaries joining the revolt by the day, it is time for us to step in and crush these raving leftists once and for all."

SAF_in_Kikuyuland:0 "Restoring Responsible Government in Kenya-Uganda"
SAF_in_Kikuyuland_desc:0 "We have finally cracked the mountain stronghold that is the Kenyan highlands, and with it have taken full control of the former Kenya-Uganda colony. Though they fought with valor and bravery, the Kenyan defense forces were no match for our superior Anglo tactics. With these lands under our full control, we must now return civil governance to these lands. We shall take a lighter hand to their governance, however, as these rebels could have easily joined in Göring’s madness, but they instead denounced his vile ideas at every turn."

SAF_Kenyan_Traitors:0 "Restoring Responsible Government in Kenya-Uganda"
SAF_Kenyan_Traitors_desc:0 "The vile and backstabbing Kenyan-Ugandas had sided with Göring and his unholy fiefdom in the War for African Reclamation, and as such they will receive treatment fitting of traitors. We will allow the creation of a local governing administration, but we will make it very clear who is in charge. The locals of these lands lost their right to the velvet glove when they sided with the Hun. They will only know the iron fist."

SAF_in_Gabon:0 "Restore Responsible Government in Gabon"
SAF_in_Gabon_desc:0 "The French administration in Gabon has sent news today to the capital that they are in dire need of aid. They are besieged on all fronts by opportunistic foes, and from within rises the risk of leftist revolt. Their plea is dire, and they beg for our help. Shall we ride to Libreville to save our French allies?"

SAF_Gabon_Wakanda:0 "Restore Responsible Government in Gabon"
SAF_Gabon_Wakanda_desc:0 "Grave news has arrived from Libreville. Our French ally’s former colony of Gabon has fallen to syndicalist revolt! Even now, the red taint spreads from these lands and further infests the Dark Continent. We must move quickly to eradicate this virus before it can spread its vile ideas to the masses."

SAF_restore_Kenya:0 "Governance of Kenya-Uganda"
SAF_restore_Kenya_desc:0 "Our local government in Kenya-Uganda has achieved some semblence of law and order in the colony, despite any possible costs. With stability and control fully established, the colony is now ready for a new Governor-General to be chosen from our loyal cadre of local bureaucrats and officers."

SAF_Decision_Group_Nuweveld:0 "The Nuweveld Project"
SAF_Decision_Group_Nuweveld_desc:0 "The wild lands of Bechuanaland have been mostly untouched by civilisation, not in the last place because the Tswana people secured themselves the protection of the United Kingdom. Now the South African government has decided to repudiate these arrangements and to open up Bechuanaland for white settlement.\n\nWhite settlers in Bechuanaland: §G[?SAF_whites_in_botswana]§!\nSettler Attractiveness: [SAF_getSettlerAttractiveness]"
SAF_Decision_Group_Boer_War:0 "The Third Boer War"
SAF_Decision_Group_Boer_War_desc:0 "Once again the interests of the British colonists and the Afrikaner descendants of the Dutch colonists of South Africa have clashed, and South Africa is on fire once more. In a cruel reversal of fates, it is now the British who have seceded from the dominion of their own making, which under the influence of Afrikaner Nationalists attempts to abandon the imperial fold."
SAF_Decision_Group_Smuts_Doctrine:0 "Ryneveld Doctrine"
SAF_Decision_Group_Smuts_Doctrine_desc:0 "The Ryneveld Doctrine, formulated by generals Jan Smuts and Pierre van Ryneveld, sets out that the former colonies belonging to the United Kingdom, lost after their collapse at the end for the Weltkrieg, cannot be left in anarchy until a coherent native force that might threaten western civilisation in South Africa forms. In the name of our national security, it is vital that we get these colonies back and expand our dominion over southern and eastern Africa."
SAF_fix_black_monday_category:0 "Response to Black Monday"
SAF_fix_black_monday_category_desc:0 "During the 1920s the South African government opted to intensify its economic ties to the Kaiserreich in the hopes of alleviating the ill effects of the Great Depression, with only limited effect. Now that Germany has been hit by its own national crisis, the effects have quickly expanded into South Africa's manufacturing sector. After only a few years of relative prosperity the nation's economy is in shambles once again.\n\nFree Budget: [saffaBudgetAmount] SA Pounds.\nInflation: [?saf_var_inflation|%-0].\nUnemployment: [?saf_var_unemployment|%R0].\nRelated debt: [saffaDebtAmount] SA Pounds."

SAF_campaign_against_tswana_insurgents:0 "Fight the Tswana Insurgency"
SAF_campaign_against_tswana_insurgents_desc:0 "The Tswana people have armed themselves and have risen in rebellion against the white encroachment on the lands that historically belonged to their tribe.\nTo prevent them from hurting our colonisation efforts, we must make good use of the UDF to contain the insurgency."
SAF_increase_settler_attraction:0 "Attract South African Settlers"
SAF_increase_settler_attraction_desc:0 "South Africa proper already has a significant settler pool. By raising awareness about the project and the government-induced benefits for moving to the borderlands we can likely increase the settlement rate with a fair amount."
SAF_ask_for_permission_to_recruit_settlers:0 "Ask for permission to recruit [From.GetAdjective] settlers"
SAF_ask_for_permission_to_recruit_settlers_desc:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has a pool of settlers in cultural-political conformity with Afrikanerdom who might be fit to bring civilisation to the Nuweveld. Of course, to set up a recruitment campaign among them we would first need to secure permission from their government."
SAF_recruit_settlers_from_from:0 "Recruit settlers from [From.GetNameDef]"
SAF_recruit_settlers_from_from_desc:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has a pool of settlers in cultural-political conformity with Afrikanerdom. With the previously acquired permission of their government we can attempt to attract settlers from this place to the Nuweveld."
SAF_yearly_nuweveld_report:0 "Yearly Nuweveld Report"
SAF_yearly_nuweveld_report_desc:0 "Every year the Nuweveld commission will forward a report to the South African government detailing the progress made with the Nuweveld project."
SAF_control_the_tswana_insurgency:0 "Control the Tswana Insurgency"
SAF_control_the_tswana_insurgency_desc:0 "The Tswana people have risen in revolt against our technically not completely legal encroachment on their formerly protected lands. If our colonisation project is to become a success, we must make sure that we can control the Tswana insurgents roaming the savannahs, who hit and then retreat back into the bush."
SAF_defend_South_Africa_mission:0 "Defend South Africa"
SAF_defend_South_Africa_mission_desc:0 "Our domestic rebels have been mostly pacified, but their [ENT.GetAdjective] masters are not yet ready to give up. However, if we can prevent them from gaining solid ground here in South Africa, they will be forced to give up at some point."
ENT_defend_South_Africa_mission:0 "Invade South Africa"
ENT_defend_South_Africa_mission_desc:0 "Our allies on the ground in South Africa have unfortunately been overrun by the numerically superior Boer forces. It is paramount that we reestablish a foothold in the region, otherwise we will be forced to recognise the republican status-quo in time."
SAF_SOC_defend_South_Africa_mission:0 "Defend South Africa"
SAF_SOC_defend_South_Africa_mission_desc:0 "The capitalist sockpuppets have been mostly neutralised, but their [ENT.GetAdjective] masters are not yet ready to give up. However, if we can prevent them from gaining solid ground here in South Africa, they will be forced to give up at some point."
ENT_SOC_defend_South_Africa_mission:0 "Invade South Africa"
ENT_SOC_defend_South_Africa_mission_desc:0 "Our allies in South Africa have unfortunately been overthrown by a mob of syndicalist militias. It is paramount that we reestablish a foothold in the region, otherwise we will be forced to recognise the republican status-quo in time."

SAF_decision_township_modernisation:0 "Upgrade Housing Conditions in the Townships."
SAF_decision_township_modernisation_desc:0 "With previous restrictions on the movement of black South Africans to the our cities lifted, the townships surrounding these cities have grown increasingly overpopulated, overwhelming the local governments and causing living conditions in these townships to be poor. Solving this problem will require a large-scale housing program."

SAF_core_south_west:0 "Incorporate South West Africa as a province"
SAF_core_south_west_desc:0 "We have successfully pacified the former German colony of South West Africa. Since the region is traditionally regarded as a part of the concept of Greater South Africa and houses a relatively large amount of South African farmers, lobbyists from both inside and outside the colony pressure the government of Pretoria to officially incorporate the region into the Union by making them a province."
SAF_core_mozambique:0 "Incorporate Southern Mozambique as a province"
SAF_core_mozambique_desc:0 "We have successfully pacified the former Portuguese colony of Mozambique. While South African activity in the region is limited, the part of the colony south of the Zambezi is traditionally regarded as part of greater South Africa and the ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques are quite valuable to our industry at the Rand. Lobbyists in Pretoria are now pressuring the government to officially incorporate the region into the union by making them into a new province under a new name, signalling that South Africa is here to stay."

SAF_internal_resistance:0 "Paramilitary and Militant Trade Union Activity"
SAF_internal_resistance_desc:0 "South Africa is at war, but not everyone is convinced it should be. As a result, on both sides of the spectrum, South Africans have organised in organisations, to either support the government or to sabotage the war effort. The South African government will need to keep both these groups in check, for those who are at present supportive of the good fight may conspire treason in the future.\n\n§YOssewabrandwag§!:\n§YStrength§!: [?saf_ob_strength|0%]\n§YStance on the war§!: [SAF_getOBWarStance]\n\n§YIndustrial and Commercial Workers' Union§!:\n§YStrength§!: [?saf_icu_strength|0%]\n§YStance on the war§!: [SAF_getICUWarStance]\n\n§YDetention Capacity§!: [SAF_getDetentionCapacity]"
SAF_suppress_ob:0 "Suppress the Ossewabrandwag"
SAF_suppress_ob_desc:0 "Concerns are rising about the growing power of the Ossewabrandwag. Voices call for us to curtail their rise by having the South African Police Service crack down on their activities."
SAF_suppress_icu:0 "Suppress the ICU"
SAF_suppress_icu_desc:0 "Concerns are rising about the growing power of the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union. Voices call for us to curtail their rise by having the South African Police Service crack down on their activities."
SAF_construct_detention_camps:0 "Construct Detainment Camps"
SAF_construct_detention_camps_desc:0 "Illicit ICU and OB activities have caused the amount of detainees in the justice system to increase significantly, causing our prison system to become slowly but steadily overwhelmed. Proposals have risen to establish detainment camps to enhance our capacity to keep these people off the streets, but comparisons with the concentration camps during the Boer War will surely be swiftly made."
SAF_control_the_ob:0 "Ossewabrandwag Activities"
SAF_control_the_ob_desc:0 "The Ossewabrandwag may be plotting to undercut, or inversely, support, our war effort. It will be important to keep an eye on their activities."

SAF_control_the_icu_desc:0 "The Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union may be plotting to undercut, or inversely, support, our war effort. It will be important to keep an eye on their activities."

SAF_intervene_south_west:0 "Intervene in South West Africa"
SAF_intervene_south_west_desc:0 "Although South West Africa has never been de-jure part of the British Empire, South Africa has administered the territory between the successful pacification of the territory and the ratification of the treaty of Copenhagen. South West Africa also hosts a relatively significant population of Afrikaner 'Dorsland Trekkers', rendering the territory interesting for Afrikaner Nationalists."
SAF_intervene_northern_rhodesia:0 "Intervene in Northern Rhodesia"
SAF_intervene_northern_rhodesia_desc:0 "The colony of Northern Rhodesia has been a contentious area for a while. Having been the connecting area between Portuguese Angola and Mozambique, and German South West Africa and Tanganyika, the region has been desired by both these powers. Great Britain originally managed to secure it in their attempt to establish a continuous land corridor from the Cape to Cairo, but when the Empire fell apart like a house of cards in 1925 Germany took away with it. Now that the Germans are gone, we are here to reclaim it!"
SAF_intervene_nyasaland:0 "Enforce the Nyasaland Protectorate"
SAF_intervene_nyasaland_desc:0 "The Nyasaland Protectorate in the Zambezi area has seen imperial interest since the explorations of David Livingstone, although its sovereignty has been contested by the Portuguese from Mozambique. The Empire eventually won out, but the region was occupied by Germany following the collapse. Now it is time we reclaim the region."
SAF_intervene_mozambique:0 "Invade Mozambique"
SAF_intervene_mozambique_desc:0 "The former Portuguese colony of Mozambique has never been part of the British Empire. However, south of the Zambezi river it is part of Jan Smuts' designs for a greater South African dominion which would be able to compete with Canada and Australasia. Besides, the Mozambican ports would be a great boon for our industry along the Witwatersrand and the region could serve as a buffer zone between South Africa proper and non-South African part of Africa."
SAF_intervene_taganyika:0 "Invade Tanganyika"
SAF_intervene_taganyika_desc:0 "Tanganyika has never been part of the British Empire, but it is in the way on the road to the other centre of gravity of British African colonialism: Kenya. Perhaps control over it can be leveraged to convince the Germans to abandon its claims elsewhere, or otherwise it at least makes arch-imperialist Cecil C. Rhodes' dream of continuous British rule from the Cape to Cairo possible."
SAF_intervene_uganda:0 "Enforce the Uganda Protectorate"
SAF_intervene_uganda_desc:0 "The Buganda Kingdom was, until the imperial collapse resulted in a German takeover of the region, a protectorate of the British empire. Now that we have (re-)established a presence in the region it is our duty to ensure that this defunct relationship is properly restored."
SAF_intervene_zanzibar:0 "Enforce the Zanzibar Protectorate"
SAF_intervene_zanzibar_desc:0 "The establishment of a protectorate over the Sultanate of Zanzibar is famous for having been the shortest war. The relationship became defunct after the collapse of the Empire, during which Germany showed its true colours and occupied the sultanate ignoring the Zanzibar-Heligoland Treaty between Britain and Germany entirely. It is our duty to restore the rightful order."
SAF_intervene_kenya:0 "Enforce the East Africa Protectorate"
SAF_intervene_kenya_desc:0 "The East Africa Protectorate in Kenya has historically served as the point of gravity in British-controlled East Africa, and the highlands of it host the third largest population of white settlers in what is supposed to be British Africa behind the Union of South Africa itself and Northern Rhodesia. We cannot leave them behind."
SAF_demand_katanga_pulls_back:0 "Demand [COG.GetNameDef] retreats from Northern Rhodesia"

SAF_establish_idc_factory_durban_desc:0 "While the town of Durban only fairly recently truly took off, it is ideally placed at the sea from our main industrial base at the Witwatersrand and has access to a relatively large base of potential Zulu labourers.

### Events ###
saf.1.t:0 "The Union of South Africa"
saf.1.d:0 "Formed in 1910 as a merger of the various British possessions in South Africa - the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange Free State - after the second Boer war, the Union of South Africa remains as the last remnant of British presence in Africa.\n\nBut the dominion is wavering: the white Afrikaner population yearns back to the independence of the Boer republics of old, while on the other side of the political spectrum syndicalism, already influential in the region since before the Commune of France or the Union of Britain materialized, is creeping into the minds of the impoverished underclass, of every racial group, who are chafing under the effects of the economic downturn.\n\nThe Union's politics revolve around a two party system: the South African Party of general Jan Smuts, and the National Party of general J.B.M. Hertzog. A smaller party, the Labour Party, currently divided in two opposing factions, also holds a presence in the South African Parliament. Between 1924 and 1929, they ruled with the National Party in a coalition government, but after their failure to tame the Great Depression, the South African Party secured a majority again, first with the help of breakaway Nationalists, and then, after 1933, after being credited for relieving the effects of the Great Depression, on its own."
saf.1.a:0 "Union is Strength."
saf.2.t:0 "The South Africa Act"
saf.2.d:0 "The South Africa Act of 1909 passed by Westminster serves as the Union's constitution: the Union of South Africa is a unitary state, rather than a federation, with each colony's parliaments abolished and replaced with provincial councils.\n\nThe national Parliament consists of two parts: the Volksraad and Senate. The Volksraad members are elected mostly by the country's white minority under first past the post, although the franchise varies depending upon the province. In the Cape and Southern Rhodesia, a qualified franchise based upon property and education requirements is in place, while the vote is white-only everywhere else. The Senate is appointed by an electoral college consisting of members of each of the five Provincial Councils and members of the Volksraad. The government follows the Westminster model, and is appointed by the Governor-General of South Africa, presently the Earl of Clarendon.\n\nSouth Africa has been administering Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland as protectorates in the place of Britain ever since the British revolution in the 1920s, while Southern Rhodesia has been admitted as a province of the union in 1922."

Since the advent of the great depression of 1925, the pact government in power at the time - a coalition of the National Party and the Labour Party, a smaller party of chiefly English-speaking white miners - elected to deepen the trade ties with the still prosperous Germany to limit the effects of the crisis, with limited success. The Smuts-Roos government that came into power in 1929 kept these arrangement in place, and as such, the woes of Black Monday did not skip South Africa.\n\nThe crisis has had a terrible effect upon the South African economy, unemployment has risen markedly as many companies that depended upon the German export market have gone out of business or laid off white workers in favour of cheaper native labour."

When the National Party rose and republican sentiments along with it, in combination with a unionist decline, they eventually agreed to merge into the South African Party. This SAP wing has persisted during the last 15 years.\n\nToday a group of unionist-inclined MPs, accompanied by several business leaders have come to appeal to prime minister Smuts to repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act passed by the Pact Government in 1925. The act affords several significant protections to the white worker which according to the business leaders cannot be sustained with the present crisis again pushing South African companies into the corner just after the effects of the Great Depression has worn off."
saf.4.a:0 "I assure you, the economy is our foremost concern!"
saf.5.t:0 "Unionists Join the Opposition"
saf.5.d:0 "The government's decision not to repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act in its strategy of resolving the effects of the black monday crisis has not gone down well with Unionists among our ranks. The minister of Commerce and Industry has resigned over our decision and eight MPs have left our parliamentary group, robbing us of our parliamentary majority.\n\nGiven our newfound lack of a working majority, tabling our package of measures against the crisis in the Volksraad would undoubtedly fail."
saf.5.a:0 "We will need to open talks with the opposition!"
saf.6.t:0 "Finding a Majority"
saf.6.d:0 "With the Unionist withdrawal, the first outright SAP majority since 1921 has disappeared almost as quickly as it appeared in 1933. Prime Minister Smuts now needs to swiftly make a decision on how to proceed, because government action is necessary to alleviate the suffering caused by Black Monday.\n\nThe first option for the prime minister is to open coalition talks with the SAP's classical rivals, the National Party. There are profound differences between these two parties but if such talks would succeed the coalition would have an overwhelming majority in the Volksraad.\n\nSecondly, a deal could be reached with the National Council faction of the split Labour party led by Walter Madeley. They would likely be inclined to support the common-man oriented approach we had in mind and finding common ground with them would likely be much easier than with National.\n\nThen, we can decide to continue as a minority government as if nothing happened and seek out support on a per-motion basis. The unionists are likely deterred from bringing us down through a motion of no confidence as they have no party structure to defend their seats anymore. We could then likely negotiate with Labour on some bills and our lost Unionists on others, but this will leave the government without a stable majority at this crucial time.\n\nThen, finally, we can request that the governor-general dissolves the Volksraad and calls early elections, but of course this carries the risk of a victory by the National Party and would mean there would be no government able to counteract Black Monday for the coming weeks."

saf.7.t:0 "Coalition Talks with National"
saf.7.d:0 "Prime Minister Smuts has chosen to engage in coalition talks with general Hertzog and his National Party. Acutely aware of his own weakened position within his party due to his failure so far to regain the office of prime minister after losing it in 1929, general Hertzog, while exhibiting a willingness to engage, seems determined to reach a compromise which will be beneficial to his party.\n\nAfter two weeks of vigourous negotiation, the differences as well as the similarities of the two parties come to light. It appears that general Hertzog is willing to help out the SAP and even abstain from pursuing further nationalist goals until this Volksraad's term is up in 1938 'for the good of the country and Afrikanerdom' on two conditions: the first is that he, James Hertzog, will come to be prime minister of this coalition government. A somewhat arrogant stance to take as the leader of the smaller parliamentary party, but one that is when it comes to it most likely largely symbolic. His second demand is probably the more controversial one: to ease the suffering of Black Monday among the white Afrikaner farmers that form his support base he wants to set up the so-called 'Nuweveld Project' which would open up the Bechuanaland protectorate which South Africa garrisons on behalf of the British exile government for the settlement of white farmers. This would be in violation of the treaties signed by Britain with the Tswana chiefdoms and likely be regarded as a heavy breach of trust by Canada."

saf.7.e:0 "No deal! Parliament should be dissolved!"
saf.8.t:0 "Talks with Labour"
saf.8.d:0 "Prime Minister Smuts has chosen to engage in coalition talks with Walter Madeley and his National Council faction of the Labour Party. The small South African Labour Party with a support base of chiefly white English-speaking miners has been split eversince Madeley was removed from his cabinet position in the Pact Government by general Hertzog with the support of Labour leader Frederic Creswell for associating with the syndicalist and interracial Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union. Since then Madeley has been disputing the position of leader of the party with Creswell.\n\nAfter about a week of negotiation it appears they would join happily a coalition government with the SAP on the simple conditions that N.C. Labour receives two cabinet positions and affirmation that we will indeed be taking a common man-oriented approach to Black Monday. This agreement could've been highly troubling to the unionist wing of our party, but given they now left our ranks this should not pose a problem."
saf.8.a:0 "An SAP-Labour cabinet will fulfil this term!"

saf.9.t:0 "The Governor-General Dissolves the Volksraad"
saf.9.d:0 "The Unionist walk-out as a result of disagreements over the strategy with regards to Black Monday has resulted in a cabinet crisis. Robbed of a working majority in the Volksraad, prime minister Smuts has asked the Earl of Clarendon to dissolve the Volksraad and call new elections six weeks from now. Since the response to Black Monday was obviously not on the table in 1933 and makes for an entirely new situation, the governor-general swiftly followed the advice of the prime minister and dissolved the Volksraad.\n\nA rough campaigning season is expected in the coming six weeks as the effects of Black Monday will befall more and more South Africans. Jan Smuts will likely be campaigning on his credentials in alleviating the effects of the Great Depression, while James Hertzog will likely once again start a scaremonger among South African whites about the prospects of increasing native influence on politics and paint Smuts as a puppet of the mining magnates of the Rand who has allowed this to happen."

saf.10.t:0 "The 1936 Elections"
saf.10.d:0 "It has been six weeks since elections have been called and the (white) South Africans are going to the polls to cast their vote. In the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia they are joined by non-whites who meet certain property and education qualifications. The outcome of this election will likely decide who will rule South Africa for the next five years: will general Smuts reclaim the majority he won in 1933, or will general Hertzog finally reclaim the office of Prime Minister for himself after seven long years in the opposition?"
saf.10.a:0 "The SAP reclaims its working majority once again!"
saf.10.b:0 "National claims a decisive majority!"
saf.11.t:0 "The Extent of Native Autonomy"
saf.11.d:0 "We have decided to formalize the autonomy of the local rulers of the former High Commissioner Territories, the Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs' power - is it limited to within the borders of the former HCT, or does it encompass all of their people throughout South Africa?"
saf.11.a:0 "Their authority stops at the border."
saf.11.b:0 "They will fully represent their people."
saf.12.t:0 "The Third Smuts Cabinet Continues"
saf.12.d:0 "The gamble of calling an election has been a resounding success: the South African electorate has clearly and decisively spoken out its approval of the government's plans to carry South Africa out of the suffering brought upon us by Black Monday. The SAP has secured itself a working majority in the Volksraad and the unionists, who have been reduced to two seats as independents are no longer needed to this end, allowing the cabinet to continue another five year term, with no need to compromise with the opposition."
saf.12.a:0 "Hurrah!"
saf.13.t:0 "The Second Hertzog Cabinet Inaugurated"
saf.13.d:0 "Smuts' gamble of calling elections in the middle of the rising Black Monday crisis has clearly backfired spectacularly. For the first time since 1929, the National Party is once again the larger of the two Afrikaner parties, and Hertzog is set to once again occupy the office of prime minister with a full mandate to deliver the National party program. National has achieved a working majority on its own, but the Creswell faction of the Labour party, who had been our allies during the 1924-1929 term, have expressed interest in joining the cabinet once again. They are not strictly necessary to govern, but it might be beneficial to secure their support if we were to lose our working majority in the future like Smuts has found out just now."

saf.14.t:0 "The Opposition Rallies against the Repeal!"
saf.14.d:0 "We have just tabled our proposed repeal of the Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924. The Nationalist opposition has decried us as 'proving to be sockpuppets of Hoggenheimer once more', referring to the personification of the English-speaking capitalists in cartoons in the Afrikaner newspaper 'die Burger' and the smaller Labour contingent, normally divided between their National Council and Creswell faction, has joined them unanimously in condemning our suggestion. But this matters little, since the SAP holds the majority in the Volksraad.\n\nMore ominous is the situation in the streets: the International Socialist League has condemned our motion and called for a general strike. Not everyone is inclined to follow their rabble-rousing, but several large mines in the Witwatersrand are completely on lockdown now. For the owners, this may be a setback that cannot be overcome in combination with the crisis if we do not act soon."
saf.14.a:0 "Let them send in their strikebreakers!"
saf.14.b:0 "Stand back, let us wait them out!"
saf.15.t:0 "Riots in Benoni"
saf.15.d:0 "The decision to send in strikebreakers seems to have inflamed the situation. The strikers assaulted the trucks be-loaded with their replacements, leading to police intervention, which in turn developed into a riot. In the Rand mining town of Benoni, which was also a hotspot in the 1922 revolt, armed rioters have forced the police to retreat from the town entirely, while elsewhere, in the town of Brakpan and several suburbs of Johannesburg, rioters are taking control block by block!\n\nTo make matters worse, news of the brutalities have reached outside the Rand, and strikes in solidarity with them are being called among dockworkers in Durban and Cape Town. With the scope of the crisis quickly growing to the meet the one of 1922."
saf.15.a:0 "This is getting out of hand!"
saf.16.t:0 "The Second Rand Revolt"
saf.16.d:0 "The crisis is quickly growing and even starts to exceed the problems on 1922: unlike back then, revolting workers are also securing ever-increasing control over Durban and Cape Town, and in Johannesburg the majority of the city has fallen under worker control. In Pretoria, panic among functionaries is rising, and parallels are being drawn between the mining strike in Wales in 1925 and the one that caused this crisis. Prime Minister Smuts remains calm under the circumstances however, arguing that, unlike in Britain, these white strikers have very little ability to project power into the South African hinterland. The cabinet debates two options: sending in the military immediately, which should quickly pacify the crisis like in 1922 but would likely come at a large cost of lives on both sides, or to use the military purely in a defensive manner, which would undoubtedly end the strikers' advance, allowing us to isolate them. They can hardly maintain this position for long and will then hopefully surrender."
saf.16.a:0 "An immediate military response is necessary!"
saf.16.b:0 "Stop and isolate them, they will soon surrender!"
saf.17.t:0 "The Battle of Mayfair"
saf.17.d:0 "Early in the morning, some 20.000 troops of the UDF poured into Johannesburg on the orders of Jan Smuts. With the full use of bombing runs by the airforce the strikers were quickly driven back, until they dug in in the Johannesburg suburb of Mayfair. A bloody fight was the result, and at the end of it more than 350 strikers lay dead, and at least 60 UDF troops. Following the battle significant amounts of strikers dispersed, and later within days order was restored in most of the Rand. Following the news of the brutal massacre in Mayfair, the strikers in Durban and Cape Town also dispersed without further violence.\n\nThe crisis is under control, but these events will likely go down as a dark page of South African history."
saf.17.a:0 "At least it is over."
saf.18.t:0 "The ICU Acts!"
saf.18.d:0 "The military reinforcement of the police indeed succeeded at stopping the socialist advance, but unlike what the government had hoped, the strikers dug in and refused to surrender, despite the seemingly hopeless situation. For about ten days, this gridlock remained, when suddenly, a devious socialist plan was revealed... Too late...\n\nThe Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, an interracial native-led trade union with a very strong influence on the rural parts of South Africa, officially declared their support for the strikers and native rioters rose everywhere, confiscating guns from the white farmers they worked for leveraging their large number and overrunning arms depots of the UDF. These impromptu rebels then hit the cordon sanitaire set up by the Union Defence Force around Johannesburg, the Rand and the rebel parts of Cape Town and Durban, leaving them trapped between the strikers and the rebels. In a disorganized frenzy, a large part of the government force was forced to surrender, or defected to the rebel forces as the odds of a socialist takeover being completed materialized further by the hour."
saf.18.a:0 "This is bad!"
saf.19.t:0 "The March on Pretoria"
saf.19.d:0 "With the besieged cities relieved from the capitalist attempts at suppression, a joint socialist force marched on Pretoria, while socialist militias skirmished with UDF remnants elsewhere in South Africa. The city of Pretoria was occupied without any further violence, and it seemed the corrupt government functionaries of the old capitalist regime, both Nationalists and those following Smuts, had dispersed, fleeing northwest towards Südwestafrika, likely going to Walvis Bay, through Bechuanaland which the ICU and ISL did not yet control.\n\nIn Pretoria, a provisional socialist government was proclaimed. A bright new, socialist, era for South Africa would dawn while the capitalist pigdogs run for their lives."
saf.19.a:0 "Workers of South Africa, unite!"
saf.20.t:0 "The Strike Expands"
saf.20.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, word about our less-than-worker-friendly response to Black Monday has quickly spread to socialist circles. Now less radical unions, aligned with the Labour Party and, in one case, National, have joined the syndicalists in their general strike, putting the country on lockdown. In Pretoria, some within the cabinet are suggesting pulling the bill to placate the strikers, and to instead counter black monday with a more Keynesian approach."
saf.20.a:0 "We will not be bullied into neglecting what is needed!"
saf.20.b:0 "Perhaps a different approach would be preferable."
saf.21.t:0 "Mine Declares Bankruptcy"
saf.21.d:0 "The lowered ability to sell its metals on the market, in combination with the complete stop on production as a result of the strike, has become too much for one of our largest metal mines in the Witwatersrand. Unable to pay off its creditors, the owners have been forced to declare bankruptcy and the company is already being liquidated as we speak to try and pay back as much as is being owed. Hundreds of jobs are lost in one go, increasing the pressure on the government to give in to the striker's demands."

saf.21.b:0 "We must give in now to limit the damage!"
saf.22.t:0 "Strikers Back Down!"
saf.22.d:0 "After two months of strike, it has been the strikers who blinked first. While they are certainly still dissatisfied with our choice to repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act, the simple reality is that the reserves of the trade unions have run out and thus the strikers can't sustain themselves with striking anymore. We have won... For now..."

saf.23.t:0 "South Africa Seeks Investment"
saf.23.d:0 "Of all Britain's dominions, the Union of South Africa has maintained the closest relations with Germany and following the dawn of the great depression in 1925, the Afrikaner Nationalist government of South Africa has closed several extensive trade deals with Germany in an attempt to stifle the recession. It is no surprise then, that now, while the entente as a whole is slowly recovering from the Great Depression, South Africa is now suffers under the effects of the recession that comes forth from the British Empire.\n\nThe current loyalist Smuts government has petitioned us for investments to help rekindle their economy. While antagonizing South Africa too much is unwise as it risks us losing control over the strategically valuable Cape of Good Hope which is our link between east and west, some within our government are of the opinion that this whole situation can be completely and unreservedly be blamed on South Africa's own policies, and that we should not waste resources needed for the homecoming on helping South Africa develop."

saf.26.t:0 "The Chief Justice of the HCT"
saf.26.d:0 "Up to this point, the law has been maintained in a decentralised fashion, divided between the High Commissioner, the Advisory Councils and the tribal governments. This has resulted in local differences and made it hard to crack down on the slavery issue, especially when tribal authorities were unwilling to cooperate.\n\nIn this light, a motion has been drafted in the Volksraad to establish the office of Chief Justice of the High Commissioner Territories.

According to this act, the small black elite that can vote under Cape Qualified Franchise will be removed from the common voter roll and moved to a separate voter roll, voting for a Native Representation Council made up of white representatives. In addition, this act will halt the right of black people to run for office.\n\nJan Smuts and his United Party wing are sceptical about this proposed intervention in the Cape and Southern Rhodesia qualified franchise, but Smuts has accepted that this act will be law on the condition that we will swiftly raise the amount of land designated to the natives from the current 8% to 13%, which he views as a fair trade and more worthwhile to the natives than the right of a small elite voting in the general elections. His liberal lieutenant Hofmeyr, who has resigned his minister post in protest, as well as Natal conservatives such as colonel Stallard disagree with this, the former because it is an apparently unrightful restriction, and the latter because the prospect of increased native lands is too liberal for their taste."

The Asiatic Land Tenure act makes it impossible for 'Asiatics' - that is to say Natal and Transvaal Indians as well as Cape Malays - to own land outside specially designated areas.\n\nAs a gesture to liberals within the party, the act also grants Indians in Natal and Transvaal the right to elect whites to parliament on a separate roll and Natal Indians to represent themselves in the Natal Provincial Council.

saf.45.d:0 "The government has decided to submit the draft of the 'Coloured' Enfranchisement Act to the Volksraad. Unsurprisingly, the Nationalist opposition is decrying this hated 'liberal' legislation and opposes it as a unit. But the prime minister's main attention goes to the conservatives within our own party. They will likely not approve of the bill, but it has been made clear to them that they should not expect to remain members of the [getSAPorUnited] if they have the gall to vote against. Their faces seem to reveal little about their choice.\n\nIf this revolutionary piece of legislation passes and the vote is subsequently granted to the 'Coloured' population, this draft will undoubtedly become the most influential law in South African history next to the South Africa Act itself and we can be sure that the era of Afrikaner Nationalism in South African politics will almost certainly be closed. But if we have misjudged the situation and the conservatives in the [getSAPorUnited] defect causing the bill to strand, the ensuing split in our party and Nationalist 'Swart Gevaar' tactics will likely be fatal and South Africa will be taken down a dark path.\n\nFor better or for worse, the bill has been submitted. Whatever happens, the submission of the bill makes it so the [getSAPorUnited] can not reasonably be considered conservative anymore."

saf.46.d:0 "Our worst fears have been realised: conservatives within our party have revolted en masse despite our warnings that this would result in the suspension of our party membership. They joined the Afrikaner Nationalist opposition in voting against this act which would 'disturb the rightful place of the white South African in the South African hierarchy and damage South African democracy by allowing poor coloureds whose votes can easily be bought by the highest bidder to vote'.\n\nFollowing the crucial vote, our former fellow party member J.G.N. Strauss, one of the MPs who voted against the legislation, announced the creation of the National Conservative Party, which would take up 'the mantle the [getSAPorUnited] was elected with and which they so carelessly threw off'. After that prime minister Smuts received the floor. He admitted that his gamble had failed but he was adamant that 'years from now, people will look back on this moment, and think, what could have been!'. He finished his speech by declaring that he would not be waiting out a motion of no confidence by the Nationalists and the new National Conservatives and that he would ask the Governor-General to dissolve parliament this same evening to let the people decide on the issue. But deep down, the prime minister knows that he gambled, and he lost."

saf.47.d:0 "Our worst fears have been alleviated: despite some early grumbling, the conservatives in our party have loyally voted in favour of the 'Coloured' Enfranchisement Act and the act has passed its first reading. These facts show that there is in fact a majority to be had for the reform and that the gamble has succeeded.\n\nThe Afrikaner Nationalist opposition is not amused at all, and one might not expect them to be, given this bill will likely render them completely unelectable in most of the Cape Province, including heartlands such as Dr D.F. Malan's constituency of Piketberg, but these grumblings will not matter. With the full support of our own party we have the needed majority in the Volksraad and they can do nothing to stop the bill from entering into force. In a speech that will likely become legendary, Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, who drafted the bill, thanked the Volksraad for their support and expressed hope that this bill will from here on out swiftly pass parliament, and eventually serve as the stepping stone towards a truly inclusive powersharing arrangement with representation for South Africa's other racial groups as well. The Nationalists seemed to be steaming in anger for the duration of the speech, but had to powerlessly sit it through."

In the other provinces, 'coloured' people will also be allowed to vote on equal terms with whites, but because their numbers are quite limited except in western Orange Free State, their newfound influence will likely be much smaller.\n\nThe influence of this change is expected to be profound: in over half of the Cape Province, including previous Nationalist heartlands, the new voting demographic will render Afrikaner nationalist victories virtually impossible, while in urban areas their often relatively smaller amount can decide races in competitive constituencies as well, as they are widely expected to vote for the [getSAPorUnited].\n\nThis act will go down in history with the person who drafted it, Jan Smuts' liberal lieutenant Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr."

Pointing at the 'Coloured' Enfranchisement Act as the beginning of a plot to grant the vote to the much larger native population, which would completely drown out white influence in South African politics.

The document is to be referred to as the 'Natal Covenant' and states that they are loyal supporters of the British Empire, and that as such, if a republic is indeed declared, they pledge to resist its authority.\n\nThousands of Natalians have signed the document, including a supermajority of the Natal Provincial Council, and equally ominously, Godfrey Huggins, the administrator of Southern Rhodesia, openly declared his support to the document.

The State President appoints the cabinet - now to be called the president's council - and can be removed by parliament for misconduct or incapacity following investigation by a joint committee. If the office were to become vacant (for instance because of removal), the president of the senate would become acting state president. This year's parliament would remain the parliament of the new republic. The entrenched sections of the South Africa Act were left unamended to ensure a simple majority would suffice to pass the act.\n\nThe passing of the bill was swiftly followed by the election of Dr. D.F. Malan as South Africa's first State President."

saf.52.d:0 "The settler population of Southern Rhodesia had never been fond of South Africa: unlike the other provinces, Southern Rhodesia was not one of the founding provinces of South Africa: it was shoehorned into the Union in 1922 as compensation by London and Pretoria with the support of the BSAC, because the contemporary governments of Bonar Law and Jan Smuts hoped it would temper the public outrage in South Africa after its forced evacuation of South West Africa. The white settler population was not consulted in this decision, despite having clearly rejected the prospect of union in the elections for the advisory council in 1919. Since the integration, the Southern Rhodesians had been continuously electing secessionist majorities in their provincial council, but unwilling to leave the British Empire as a whole, they were deterred from actually following through in their rhetoric of leaving the union.\n\nNow that South Africa has abandoned the empire, the provincial authorities in Salisbury have swiftly affirmed their allegiance to the king-emperor and declared their independence from the illegitimate republic."

Secondly, there are the dominionists, who voted in favour of the secession and claim they would henceforth only ever accept reintegration under circumstances of an authoritarian government ensuring British South African supremacy of the Afrikaners. What's left is the SAP councillors who voted against secession.\n\nThe Dominionist Party and the UFP swiftly formed the independence coalition and declared the secession of Natal from the Union with the majority, following in the footsteps of Southern Rhodesia. It holds a degree of irony that this pro-imperial secession takes place almost exactly a century after the declaration of the Boer republic of Natalia in this same city."

And given the provinces will be rejoining the British Empire, it must be considered that they could form a security threat to South Africa if some day the homecoming is completed and Britain decides it wants to recover its empire.\n\nWith these concerns in mind, restoring order in the provinces of Natal and Southern Rhodesia seems inevitable."

Once these changes have been put into effect, we can start 'buying' up Bechuanaland land. Some pressure might need to be applied on this matter. After this the land will be in our possession and we can encourage white settlers to assume ownership over a piece of this land at a low price. Once sufficient people have settled in the protectorate, we can annex the protectorates and establish a new province in former Bechuanaland."

Even if we brush aside the fact that this is likely a blatant attempt to permanently bind Bechuanaland to their union, which would result in us finding the full integration of Bechuanaland as a fait accompli once the homecoming has been completed, this constitutes a gross violation of the treaties we signed with the Tswana people native to Bechuanaland."

Both started out in one single Afrikaner South African Party, but the ideological differences between the two sides soon came to light and caused a split in the South African Party, with the former remaining in the original party and the latter forming their own 'National Party' in opposition to the former. Since then, Afrikanerdom seemed irreversibly split along ideological lines.\n\nThis remained so until the formation of the National-SAP coalition last year. This cooperation has been quite fruitful and both sides have to accept the prospect that their two-party dominance is increasingly challenged by other parties and independents dissatisfied with the status-quo, especially after the economic woes during the last two decades. Deputy prime minister Smuts has now engineered a plan to, for the first time since the very first general election of 1910 unite the South African and Nationalist Parties into a single list for the elections of 1938, the so-called United Party."

saf.79.t:0 "The Start of the Great Trek"
saf.79.d:0 "The centenary celebration of the Great Trek, when the ancestors of South Africa's Boers moved into the interior of South Africa to escape British influence, has been kicked off at the foot of the statue of Jan van Riebeeck - the Dutch explorer viewed by many Afrikaners as the founding father of their nation - in Cape Town. The first ox-wagons have already departed under the watchful eye of a large crowd, estimated to be made up of over one hundred thousand people - astounding given that Cape Town is considered to be an English city. The chairman of the Great Trek Centenary Committee, National politician H.J. Klopper, owns the first two wagons of the parade, and invited all of Afrikanerdom to partake in the festivities. The ox-wagon parade will follow the so-called 'Pad van Suid-Afrika' to Pretoria, while a smaller contingent will split off at Vegkop and instead journey to the location where the battle of Blood River took place in Natal. Over the next few months, the ox-wagons of the re-enactment will be passing through numerous small towns and larger cities where Afrikaners in classic voortrekker clothing, while the 'dominee', the town priest, will be welcoming them with extensive festivities."

saf.80.d:0 "The ox-wagons of the Centenary celebration have arrived in Port Elizabeth, after having passed to medium-size towns like Stellenbosch, Paarl, Worcester and Swellendam and a myriad of small towns and villages. In all these settlements, the festivities have been a resounding success, bringing out a wave of intense Afrikaner patriotism. However, the city of Port Elizabeth is primarily inhabited by English-speakers who are quite hostile to this celebration of Afrikaner culture, and for this reason, as well as the unfriendly attitude towards Afrikaners espoused by its mayor, Klopper has decided against seeking the confrontation by holding a parade through the city, with the parade instead directly moving on towards the small town of Willowmore and after that to towards Graaff-Reinet and the site of the Slagter's Nek rebellion in 1816 which is regarded as one of the reasons behind the original Great Trek."

At Slagter's Nek the festivities were especially massive and in every town where the parade arrives the song 'Die Stem van Suid-Afrika' is sung by the crowd. Despite its limited size as a farm near Steynsburg, Bulhoek is significant because it is the birthplace of Paul Kruger, the famous president of the South African Republic (Transvaal) who eventually died in exile during the Second Boer War. Here too large amounts of people welcomed the parade, if not as many as in Slagter's Nek. Tomorrow the parade will pass into Steynsburg proper and within a few days the ox-wagons are expected to cross into the Orange Free State, leaving the Cape Province behind."

Once the parade will arrive in Pretoria, our seat of government, the re-enactment will have visited them all.\n\nIn previous cities the parade visited, many street names were renamed in honour of Afrikaner heroes, but English-speaking town council of Bloemfontein has refused to follow suit. In response Klopper has refused to use the new oxen provided by the city and made a statement by pulling the wagons through the city by hand. At the same time, torches were revealed by young participants of the Trek, which had apparently been kept alight since the parade left Cape Town.\n\nThe rest of the month will be dedicated to the trek to site of the battle of Vegkop, near the town of Heilbron."

At present, many of the participants, both of those driving or following ox-wagons, and those partaking in the local festivities, have allowed their beards to grow so as to look more like their ancestors 100 years ago.\n\nFrom here, a small contingent of the ox-wagon parade will be splitting off. They will travel south from here into the province of Natal, to be present at the site of the battle of Blood River, which will be exactly a century ago coming Dingane's Day, visiting cities like Ladysmith, Pietermaritzburg and Durban on the way. The remainder of the parade will continue to follow 'die Pad' into the province of Transvaal, to be present at the laying of the foundation of the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria at Dingane's Day."

From there, the parade adjusted back south, moving through mining towns like Benoni and Roodepoort to eventually arrive the industrial city of Johannesburg. Despite the fact that Johannesburg too, is an English city, the crowd is large, although it will likely dwarfed by the receiving crowd in Pretoria three days from now.\n\nAs the parade leaves the city, it is reinforced with additional ox-wagons of local Afrikaners, some of whom are flying the 'Vierkleur': the flag of the defeated South African Republic."

The scale of the crowd that was waiting for the Trekkers can be described as nothing less than astounding: estimations are ranging from one hundred thousand to two hundred and fifty thousand Afrikaners, which could amount to a third of all Afrikaners in the country including cabinet ministers and even general Jan Smuts, although he declined to give a speech. The festivities are still officially apolitical, but the crowd was singing 'Die Stem' and calling for a republic.\n\nWhen the Ossewa's finally arrive, a giant bonfire was lit with the torches that have been kept alight from Cape Town and three Afrikaner women, descendants of the Voortrekker leaders, placed the first cornerstone of the monument. Then, the wagons are - without their oxen - carried upon the hill. Once firmly put in place, heroic scenes of the original Great Trek were re-enacted; the descendant of a British settler who gave one of the first voortrekkers a bible was shouted down for reciting the English greeting of his ancestor in this play. In the evening, the festivities were closed off with the traditional South African Braai.\n\nAt the same time, the smaller delegation that split off at Vegkop arrived at Blood River, where they were welcomed by Dr. D.F. Malan who delivered the main address, electrifying the crowd by comparing the old trek with the current process of urbanisation and calling for the establishment of an Afrikaner republic."

Both pointed at the draft of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, which would pass parliament tomorrow under Malan's guidance.

While neither has much love for syndicalism, Hertzog believes that no South Africans should die in what is strictly an European conflict, and that unreservedly joining the side of the British would hurt Afrikaner-British relations here in South Africa. Instead he propagates armed neutrality, remaining out of the war unless our interests are directly threatened.\n\nSmuts on the other hand, wants South Africa to partake in the homecoming directly, arguing that South Africa has this moral obligation towards the British Empire, as its dominion and to make up for the protection the country is afforded within its framework. No compromise can seemingly be found and the fusion government is shaking to its foundation. To resolve the issue, the cabinet has taken to a vote among the ministers."

When asked about syndicalism by an MP, Hertzog responded that the syndicalist revolution was far away, focused on Europe and does not pose a credible threat to South Africa, isolated as it is behind a continent worth of unindustrialised nations.\n\nJan Smuts rose to his feet to challenge this claim: the syndicalists of the Internationale were out for world domination he exclaimed, and have to be stopped. He points out that South Africa, as a nation with only a small population spread over a large  territory, is poor in defence, but rich in resources, and that distancing ourselves from our allies would leave us vulnerable to an attack.\n\nHertzog's motion for neutrality was put to the vote..."

If he follows his advice however, as Hertzog would argue is his only choice according to parliamentary procedure, everything could still happen at the hands of the South African electorate.

It also formed a number of other unions amongst people of colour. While the leaders of the organisation itself are mainly drawn from the radical wing of the white working class, the Industrial Workers of Africa founded with their help would merge into the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, which has a substantial black African, 'Coloured' and Indian membership. While the South African Labour Party has remained apart from the ISL due to its more progressive stance on race relations more radical members push for a reconciliation.

Since the law specifically states that Syndicalism aims to disrupt racial harmony, it can be frequently used to gag opposition to apartheid.

The first of these was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, prohibiting marriage between whites and people of other races. The Immorality Amendment Act forbade 'unlawful racial intercourse' and 'any immoral or indecent act' between a white and a black, Indian or 'coloured' person. Transport and civil facilities were segregated. Education was strictly segregated, with universities established for the sole use of Xhosa, Zulu, Sotho, 'Coloured', Indians etc. The cumulative effect of this was to stratify society solidly along racial lines."

saf.104.d:0 "The second stage of grand apartheid was the Group Areas Act. Until then, despite existing segregation law, most settlements had people of different races living side by side. This Act put an end to diverse areas and determined where one lived according to race. Each race was allotted its own area, which could be used as a basis for force eviction, allowing the government to demolish black shanty town slums and forced white employers to pay for the construction of housing for those black workers who were permitted to reside in cities otherwise reserved for whites."

saf.105.d:0 "Territorial separation was hardly a new institution in South Africa. There were, for example, the 'reserves' created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, the percentage of land reserved was increased from 8 to 13 percent to be used for black homelands, still a relatively small amount compared with the total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. These homelands or 'Bantustans' divided South Africa into a number of separate states, each of which is supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for the different ethnic groups. The practical effect of this legislation was to remove the citizenship of natives living within South Africa and reduce their status to that of migrant labour. The Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act abolished the remaining parliamentary representation for black people under the Representation of Natives Act, now represented by their own 'national' authorities."
saf.105.a:0 "Interesting."
saf.106.t:0 "Race in South Africa"
saf.106.d:0 "South Africa's population is perhaps the most diverse in all of Africa, but racism and segregation are institutionalized and omnipresent.\n\nThe white European population forms the top of South Africa's racial hierarchy; they hold socio-economic power in the nation and enforce a degree of segregation throughout South Africa. The group is divided between the Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch colonists who arrived in the Cape during Dutch rule, who hold political power owing to being the majority of the almost exclusively white electorate, and the British South Africans, English-speaking descendants of colonists who arrived in the 19th century, who hold most economic power, although this is shifting somewhat to the Afrikaner advantage in recent years.\n\nOf the non-white population, the so-called 'Coloured' community enjoys the most respect. This group is made up of people of mixed heritage and most of them speak Afrikaans, the same language as white Afrikaners. They make up the majority of population in the western Cape Province, and make up the largest part of the non-white property-based voters in that same province as well as in Southern Rhodesia.\n\nThen there is the Asiatic group: South Africans of Asian descent. The majority in this group are former indentured workers from British India or their descendants, who live primarily in Natal and to a smaller extent in Transvaal. In the Cape one can also find the Cape Malays, who were brought here from Maritime Southeast Asia by the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe least respected are the original (native) black Africans. Most of them belong to one of several Bantu peoples, the Xhosa, the Zulu, the Sotho or one of several smaller tribal groups. Despite making up the majority of the South African population by far, they have very little political power, even in the provinces where non-whites can theoretically vote, where very few of them fulfill the needed property requirements. With an entrenched white electorate, hopes for reform are dim."

Ever since, Kadalie has acted as the representative of the South African syndicalist movement in London and Paris.

Drafts are based on the systems of government of Britain and France, but it seems clear that there will be factionalism. On the one hand, there is William Henry Andrews and his ISL, who, while openly calling for an eventual powersharing arrangement, argue that whites will first need to guide the socialist state until the popular majority is sufficiently educated and politically aware to be able to properly participate in communal politics. On the other hand are the ICU, who have elected to be led by the newly arrived Clements Kadalie. They want to immediately implement a system of ethnic federalism, giving a degree of autonomy to each ethnic group under a unified multiracial state.\n\nAs a compromise between the whites who fear swamping by the larger amount of natives, the decisions will be made by a half on half split group of representatives of both organisations."

The ICU on the other hand wants the upper house to be an Ethnic Representation Council, with each ethnicity receiving two delegates, who can with a majority send legislation back to the SACTU, who would then be obliged to amend or repeal it before sending it back to the ERC."

saf.109.b:0 "Each ethnicity needs representation."
saf.110.t:0 "The Judicial Branch"
saf.110.d:0 "Another clash has started over the judicial branch: the ISL wants a single and colourblind judicial system for all South Africans, regardless of the circumstances of the crime, but no right to object to who judges you based on the colour of their skin. In effect, because almost exclusively whites have been educated in the law, this means the old judicial system will likely be mostly preserved, and as the system creates no pressure to educate new non-white lawyers, justice will be carried out almost exclusively by whites for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis reality has been noticed by the ICU, who instead want it constitutionally entrenched that each racial group in the federation will have the right to be judged by their own ethnicity if they so desire in a case against the government, and a judge not held to the ethnicity of either side in a civil case."
saf.110.a:0 "We don't have the manpower at present to accomodate for that right!"

saf.111.t:0 "The Executive Branch"
saf.111.d:0 "The final conflict is with regards to the executive branch.\n\nThe ISL wants the government to derive its legitimacy from the upper house, and to atypically make it possible for that house to recall government officials only. Under their plan, the SACTU will only have the ability to control the government through failing to approve its legislation.\n\nOf course, the ICU disagrees, and wants the point of gravity to be with the SACTU/lower house, which more properly represents the will of the people according to them as it is elected indirectly but equally by every worker in our nation."

Elections have been held on the grounds of the decisions made and it was clear that the ISL managed to concentrate a large amount of power to themselves. It is of little surprise therefore, that the William Henry Andrews, leader of the provisional government, has been elected as South Africa's first chairman. He then recommended a cabinet which was swiftly also approved. Under Jones' guidance, socialism in South Africa will likely venture into a bright new future.

saf.113.d:0 "The Johannesburg Convention has closed and a constitution has been approved. Elections have been held on the grounds of the decisions made and it was clear that the ICU managed to break the power monopoly the ISL was intent on designating to themselves. As such, after years of exile in Britain, Clements Kadalie has been elected as the first non-provisional chairman of the new South Africa, and the first non-white head of state of the nation. Seeking to prevent racial struggles from embracing the country, he has recommended a cabinet with members of each of South Africa's ethnicities, headed by the secretary of the executive, Solomon Sachs, a white South African and friend of Kadalie. Despite this, the new mostly non-white government takes some adjusting for the white population of South Africa, and unrest in areas where they form the majority is on the rise."

saf.114.d:0 "It has been reported that the executive committee of the Industrial and Commercial Worker's Union has fired Clements Kadalie as the chairman of the union.\n\nWhile Kadalie was toasting with the leadership of the Union of Britain after being deported, the running of the ICU was taken over by people on the ground right here in South Africa, fighting suppression by South African authorities. This already created a perception that Kadalie hijacked the voice of the ICU without having partaken in the revolution, but as the founder of the organisation, Kadalie had the needed support to pull the members along.\n\nTo a dead end, it seems now, because Kadalie had been advocating working with the ISL and their white leaders, despite the opposition from the Africanist faction in the Union led by James La Guma. Now it appears the ISL government is only marginally interested in the ICU, and has given few if any worthwhile concessions.\n\nGiven it is Kadalie who led the union here, he is the one to take the fall. Following his dismissal, the executive committee appointed Jimmy La Guma the new chairman. It is expected that La Guma will pull the ICU into a more radical direction, for he was never afraid to share his opinion that the black population of South Africa is the true proletariat."

According to him, our new socialist government is functionally little different from the old regime, being a vehicle to securing the position of the whites over the backs of a black proletariat.\n\nApparently we pay lip service to the idea of majority rule to appeal to Paris while we suppress black participation in practice. It is the natural outcome as the white working class is economically dependent on the work of the black working class and therefore he declares that the ICU will have to continue its struggle and work towards a native republic."

From Cape Town to Salisbury and Durban, militias control the streets.\n\nHowever, in Pretoria, William Henry Andrews and the rest of the government, having become aware of the massive revolt of the native African population fed up with the lies of the white socialists, rallied the army and the ISL militia composed overwhelmingly of white workers to defend the city at all costs. Victory may seem impossible given the disproportionate numbers of La Guna's army compared to the government's, but with the majority of the army's professional officers rallying to the government, victory is still possible.

It comes as little surprise then that Malan subsequently challenged Hertzog for the party leadership of the party. The members were asked to speak out their preferences. Hertzog’s failure in the last 8 years to seize the office of prime minister back from general Smuts had sealed his fate: dr. Malan would lead the National Party in the next general election, on an aggressive republican and Afrikaner Nationalist platform, decrying that once given the mandate he will declare South Africa’s full independence as a republic now that the exiles are not in a position to act against such a measure."

As such, the day holds importance to Afrikaner nationalism as well, whose adherents view the victory that day as a sign from God that they were to shape a western country in South Africa's wilderness.\n\nThe day is generally celebrated with sports matches, especially cricket, theatre shows, church gatherings and other festivities.

In the many constituencies outside of the Cape, where barring some exceptions the new 'Coloured' voters could not make a difference versus the existing white electorate, gains have been limited, in no small part due to the splits the National Party has been suffering, causing the more consolidated government candidates to win in some constituencies which were destined to go to the Nationalists otherwise. Some newspapers have already declared Afrikaner Nationalism a thing of the past, reduced to a large minor party which could at best secure a kingmaker position.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the Labour Party has been making gains.

Once again, police stood powerless to prevent an evidently well-planned escape into the bush to the south of the town.\n\nDisturbingly, it appears the gang has already grown in number since their heist in Ermelo, and similarly worryingly, the town of Barberton, where Nongoloza is incarcerated on a rape charge, is only some 20 miles away from Nelspruit. Police theorizes that it is the gang’s intention to break him out. Others disagree and point out that this would be too obvious, and that the two successful heists, in combination with smaller robberies underway, have already netted the group a substantial amount of wealth. One more successful heist would likely procure the monetary means needed for the group to disappear forever, and in modern times and resources like automobiles and airplanes, it seems implausible that a gang would remain at large for as long as the previous gangs have. Therefore they propose an attack on Barberton would be a large risk following their existing achievements, and they instead point at the town of Lydenburg as the next target. Some don’t agree with this proposal either, and expect the gang will aim to leave South Africa by entering Portuguese East Africa as soon as possible, as the route of movement from Ermelo to Nelspruit suggests.

Not so in the upper echelons of Johannesburg society, where men in red garments still speak about their exploits on five continents with one another under the enjoyment of a gin-tonic supplied by a zulu servant.\n\nFollowing two years of preparation, the Empire exhibition, celebrating the city of Johannesburg’s golden jubilee, has been opened with great festivities. The exhibitions both boast our achievements in the last half-century and include representatives from most of what remains of the empire: from Canada and the Caribbean to Australasia and its pacific extensions. While an atmosphere of nostalgia is unmistakable, the celebration takes away from the talks about liberation and politics holding grip on our country, and shows that the empire is still alive as ever!"

saf.156.d:0 "The new South Africa does not endorse the old racist measures employed by the old racist capitalist regime, which has been frantically trying to keep black South Africans out of South Africa's urban regions like Johannesburg and Cape Town. Now that this regime has fallen, their barbaric policies are naturally being rescinded. Unfortunately, this brings some unintended side-effects with it: rural South Africa is not very rich in opportunity, and thus, with the possibility of moving to cities like Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban suddenly no longer severely restricted, many thousands of South Africans are now leaving their ancestral lands to seek employment in the factories and mines. Unfortunately, the local governments do not actually have the resources to handle this unprecedented influx and most of these migrants are thus forced to settle in existing townships at a scale never seen before, overpopulating them and causing extremely squalid conditions and disease in these townships as a result."

It took until 1913 until they even considered giving some of it back, more because they didn’t want us in the cities they had built on it than out of kindness, and even then their goal was limited to a laughable 8%, when we made up nearly 70% of the population according to our own census. Even when they subscribed to the tenets of socialism so short ago, they still rejected turning this historical abomination into a more equitable settlement.\n\nNo more: we shall take what was stolen from us and return it to the people. From today on South Africa will once more belong to its inhabitants and not a small group of capitalist European colonisers using its ‘property’ as an excuse to exploit our people!"

Furthermore, the reputation as a British lower class sport did not do its spread much good as it has been associated with the Union of Britain. As such, the new club in Orlando is one of the first of its kind, and may turn out to be a turning point in the popularity of the sport.

Apparently this Flytaal or endonymically Flaaitaal has been used for a longer stretch of time by the local underworld as a coded language, but it is now finding its way to common use on the street as it becomes a symbol for rebelliousness against the state.\n\nThis new slang language makes it quite troubling for the police to use informants as township outsiders are increasingly having trouble infiltrating local gangs or even the community as a whole now..."

saf.171.t:0 "Foundation of the ANC Youth League"
saf.171.d:0 "The African National Congress (earlier known as the South African Native National Congress) has been a force behind native emancipation since its foundation in 1912. The group, comprised of both black intellectuals and tribal chiefs, has stagnated however during the twenties, with the Industrial Commercial Workers’ Union (ICU) taking over its prominence as the foremost native rights activists. Since then, the ANC had been working to create an united front with Indians and Coloureds, and sympathetic whites to achieve reform.\n\nUnder the leadership of Anton Lembede, several young ANC-aligned activists - Nelson Mandela, B. Masekela, Ashby Mda, Ida Mtwa, Lillian Ngoyi, James Njongweni, William Nkomo, Duma Nokwe, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo and Dan Tloome - have gathered in opposition against this compromissory attitude, and formed the African National Congress Youth League in Johannesburg. The new youth league is known to make use of Africanist rhetoric, and released a ‘Program of Action’ against the white minority regime, involving the use of boycotts, strikes and defiance tactics. Some claim this new sub-organisation may prove to be the turning point for the ANC’s fortunes, enabling it to address a new generation of activists."

saf.172.d:0 "The Coloured Enfranchisement Act has, unsurprisingly, shifted South Africa’s politics quite a bit to the progressive side.\n\nThis has enabled certain political goals of the progressive cause, which were earlier political impossibilities, to be put into action.\n\nOne of the first of these goals is the Native Education Act. Prior to [GetYear] non-whites have had to rely on religious institutions for their lower education, while whites have had access to state-funded and private schools of western standard. The Act significantly increases funding for non-white education to close this gap, and makes provisions to help non-whites to fulfill the requirements to enroll in university."

saf.173.t:0 "The Native Participation Act"
saf.173.d:0 "A regularly stated belief by Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr was that at one point the native population would have to be represented by one of their own. Unsurprisingly, this was the Nationalists’ worst fear, and many white South Africans appeared not to have grown to the idea, seeing as the publication of this notion tended to swing by-elections in the Nationalist favour.\n\nHowever, times are changing, and now a large enough majority in the Volksraad has been gathered to pass the Native Participation Act. This act mandates that the cabinet is to appoint a member of the native community as the Minister of Native Affairs with a vote in the cabinet. The [getSAPorUnited] has accompanied the tabled bill with the intention to appoint a native to the role as soon as this bill has passed the Volksraad."

The proletarians have declared a worker's state in Pretoria, on the model of the Union of Britain. Given the strategic positioning of South Africa, there are those who seek an immediate intervention in South Africa to drag it back into the fold, but given South Africa's isolated location, it might be quite difficult to actually invade them, especially on such a short notice."

As will be seen, the constitution is only intended for the Afrikaners; the English are to play a subordinate role.\n\nThis is the first article of the new constitution which has been ratified by Commander-General Van Rensburg today in Pretoria. The new basis of South African law, drafted by professor Lodewicus du Plessis of the Potchefstroom University, does away completely with the old 1909 South Africa Act-based constitution of D.F. Malan’s republic.\n\nThe new constitution heralds Afrikaans as the national language while demoting English to be merely ‘supplementary’, vests all powers into the office of ‘Volksleier’ - people’s leader - who is only responsible to God, not beholden to any votes in the advisory parliament, and who can implement and ratify laws on his personal signature. Citizenship will be beholden only to those the 'of whom it can be expected that they will act as builders up of the nation' and those are called ‘burgers’. It also gives the state the express permission to censor those ‘burgers’ and organisations who endanger public order or the good morale of the republic.\n\nWith this, the power of the newly ordained Volksleier Van Rensburg is legitimized and supreme."

They led an independent existence with their own ‘Free Republic of Rehoboth’ until the Germans took control over the region, from whom they managed to extract a degree of autonomy. During the Weltkrieg, they attempted, unsuccessfully, to remain neutral in the German-South African conflict, culminating in the battle of Sam Khubis where they successfully defended their community from German forces. When in 1919 South Africa was forced to turn South West Africa back over to the Germans, the Rehoboth community was split between those who would inevitably be seen as pro-South African collaborators and sympathisants (especially Sam Khubis veterans) who were forced into exile in South Africa, and those remaining in Rehoboth, with their historic autonomy revoked.\n\nNow that Bechuanaland has been opened to white settlement, their ‘Kaptein’ (equivalent of chief) Albert Mouton has petitioned the prime minister for the establishment of a ‘Nuwe Roheboth’ in Bechuanaland, relatively close to their old settlement across the border, which would be expected to attract the scattered exiles. And if we would grant them the right to apply their Vaderlike Wette (constitution) to the settlement as they ask, it will probably attract at least some of those who remained in Mittelafrika as well..."

What was once the pride of the German nation has transformed in possibly the largest anarchy and violence the world has ever seen. South West Africa, or Deutsch-Südwestafrika is no exception to this rule, with white German settlers, bolstered by Afrikaners who moved into the region over the course of the 19th century, desperately attempting to suppress a native revolt against their rule.\n\nFact is that South West Africa has for a long time been a strategic goal for South Africa, and between 1915 and 1919 it was us who had been administering the territory. Calls are rising throughout South Africa that this is the time to undo ahistorical injustice: having had to turn South West Africa back over to the hun after we had won it with South African blood, because the war was lost in Europe. They call on the prime minister to send the Defence Force to South West Africa, put down the native revolt and integrate the colony into our nation. A telegraph message to Windhoek has been drafted, proposing that South Africa intervenes and suppresses the Namiblanders in return for their acceptance that South West Africa will, this time permanently, fall under the stewardship of South Africa."

They express a willingness to intervene in our little problem with Namibland, but then we are to accept that the South African forces will never leave. It’s clear that they just want us to acquiesce in the fact that the German Mittelafrika dream has evaporated and that we will henceforth be South Africans. Some call this unacceptable, that we are German subjects and shall remain so. But others ask if it is truly worth risking the well-being of our people, the White Namibians, for this dream: support from the Vaterland might be months away and if we cannot hold back the Namiblanders, we may be exiled or worse by that native authority. Besides, South Africa may well intervene even if we reject their interference, the only difference will be that they will also be shooting at us..."

Possibly, the Germans might be plotting to take colony which would increase its leverage over us.\n\nHawks are urging us to act first by ordering our army to cross the Mozambican border, so as to ensure that South Africa’s interests are secured, and some of them are probably hoping we will annex the colony outright in the future.

The French were quick to surround the tank, keeping back the crowds as repairs were made. The tank was quickly fixed with the commander allowing several children to ride on the back as they drove to local barracks. This instantly won over the locals, who began to call the French, "Camarades" and shouted what few French words they knew.

saf.collapse.8.t:0 "Help from Gabon"
saf.collapse.8.d:0 "A private telegram has arrived from Libreville, which until recently was known as Tirpitzstadt. The message was sent by the now-free colonial government of Gabon who seek to join our illustrious alliance. That is, they *will* join if we agree to help them in their wars and respect their territorial claims to former Mittelafrikan lands. Such small concessions are nothing compared to the bounties we will reclaim if we win the coming reclamation war, and so Gabon will be sworn in immediately as the newest member of the Entente."
saf.collapse.8.a:0 "We welcome the people of Gabon into the Entente's embrace."

saf.collapse.9.t:0 "Setting up the new Kenyan-Ugandan Government"
saf.collapse.9.d:0 "The old colony of Kenya-Uganda was once the center of the British Empire in Eastern Africa. For too long has it languished under German control, becoming more and more dilapidated and misused with every new policy the Hun enacts. Due to their own sheer incompetence, the Hun has lost its grasp over the Kenyan highlands, and these lands beckon to be returned to Anglo hands. With the arrival of our initial delegation, we have gotten to work on restructuring the Kenyan-Ugandan administration. However, a new question has arisen: should the two colonies maintain their connection, or finally be severed into two, separate entities under Rothschilds’ supervision? Though two administrations are harder to maintain than one, the ethnic and cultural divides may be too great for a unified colony to survive. Ultimately, the choice lies with us."
saf.collapse.9.a:0 "Keep them together, Kenya-Uganada is indivisible!"

saf.collapse.10.t:0 "The Central African Stage"
saf.collapse.10.d:0 "The lights are on, the stage is set, the hour we have all been waiting for is finally here: on this day, we march from the Cape of Good Hope deep into the Dark Continent to reclaim what the dastardly Hun stole from us over decades ago. By the time this coming bloodshed is finished, the Union Jack will fly from Cape Town to Dar-es-Salam, and from Libreville to Mombasa; with this the British Empire will be vindicated and reborn as the eternal Anglo takes his seat atop the world stage again. This is our moment, our final hour, our curtain call. We will partake on the righteous crusade and ensure that the sun never truly sets on our King's empire. For King and Country!"
saf.collapse.10.a:0 "It is time to reverse the setting sun; the Anglo's golden age has only just begun..."

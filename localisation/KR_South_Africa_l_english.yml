### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JAMES_HERTZOG_DESC:0 "James Barry Munnik Hertzog first rose to prominence as a Boer guerrilla leader in the second Anglo-Boer war; defiant to the last, he resisted the British long after the war had been definitively lost. Even in defeat, however, Hertzog continued to champion the Afrikaner people. He rose to leadership of the Afrikaner dominated 'National Party', and in 1924, became South Africa's first Nationalist prime minister in coalition with Labour. With the collapse of the United Kingdom the following year, Hertzog was confronted with the fact that he did not have the parliamentary majority to take South Africa out of the Empire, but managed to assume stewardship of the High Commissioner Territories. Hertzog, now as State President of the new South African Republic, has been a proponent of segregation between South Africa's various racial groups, and has encouraged the disenfranchisement and resettlement of South Africa's already oppressed black population."
POLITICS_JAN_SMUTS_DESC:0 "Jan Christiaan Smuts, though an Afrikaner veteran of the Second Boer-War, had, by the onset of the Weltkrieg, become a staunch proponent of South African autonomy within the British Empire. During the Weltkrieg, Smuts led South Africa's armies against the Germans in Namibia and clashed with the famous Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck in East Africa. In defeat, Smuts continued for South Africa's future; while he was temporarily swept out of power in 1924 by the National Party, who wanted to break with Britain permanently, he was back in charge in 1929. He has been fighting for South Africa's alliance with the Entente for his entire career, and it does not appear he is about to give up."
POLITICS_KING_EDWARD_SAF_DESC:0 "Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_NICOLAAS_HAVENGA_DESC:0 "Nicolaas Christiaan Havenga, once a loyal supporter of the James Hertzog and the National Party, and perhaps an even more radical Afrikaner nationalist, left the party over disagreements with its economic policies. He founded the 'Afrikaner Party' in opposition to what was, in his view, the regressive economic platform of the National Party. As president, Havenga seeks to deregulate foreign trade and promote the exploitation of South Africa's vast gold deposits."
POLITICS_DANIEL_MALAN_DESC:0 "Daniel François Malan, former editor of the National Party's newspaper, Die Burger, has outmanoeuvred rival James Hertzog to secure dominance of South Africa's nationalist faction. Malan is, even by Afrikaner Nationalist standards, a hard-line proponent of racial segregation and the suppression of South Africa's black population. As State President, Malan strives to transform South Africa into a nation completely by and for the Afrikaner people, and by nearly any means necessary."
POLITICS_HERBERT_STANLEY_DESC:0 "Herbert James Stanley, British-Rhodesian political leader, with the death of Jan Christiaan Smuts, has become governor-general of the Dominion of South Africa. Stanley, an Englishman, seeks to foster even more resilient economic and political ties with Canada, while maintaining South Africa's independence."
POLITICS_EARL_CLARENDON_DESC:0 "George Herbert Hyde Villiers, the Right Honourable Earl of Clarendon, previously member of the British Government in Exile in Canada, was appointed Governor-General of South Africa in 1931, taking care of His Majesty's duties in South Africa for him: appointing the cabinet and dissolving parliament if need be. Notably, the earl is also the chief scout of South Africa. Despite the fact that his political wit induces respect, some voice concerns over the fact that South Africa's Governor-General is not a South African..."
POLITICS_PAT_DUNCAN_DESC:0 "Sir Patrick Duncan was born in Scotland in 1870, in a time quite different from now, when Britain still ruled the world. Having emigrated to South Africa in during the Boer War, after which he practiced as an attorney and then joined politics first as a member of the pro-British Unionist Party and then after the merger the South African Party, Duncan is the first South African to citizen to be appointed as Governor-General of the Union. A milestone."
POLITICS_NJ_DE_WET_DESC:0 "Nicolaas Jacobus de Wet was never supposed to be acting Governor-General of South Africa: a judge by profession, he was Chief Justice of the nation when unexpectedly the existing Governor-General, sir Patrick Duncan, passed away. It was ruled that De Wet would do as an acting Officer Administering the Government of South Africa, and as such, De Wet is now both the first Afrikaner and first South African born in South Africa who takes care of His Majesty's duties as Head of State."
POLITICS_ERNEST_JANSEN_DESC:0 "Pushed through on the insistence of the National Party, who were determined to get a 'neutral' Governor-General, of course coming from their own ranks, E.G. Jansen. Jansen, an Afrikaner from Natal, is as such the first Afrikaner and first South African born right here in South Africa who administeres His Majesty's duties as South Africa's Head of State."
POLITICS_JOHANNES_VAN_RENSBURG_DESC:0 "From secretary of former Justice Minister Tielman Roos, to dictator of South Africa. Few will have foreseen how events turned out. Van Rensburg has always been the leader of the most extreme wing of the National Party, speaking of the Afrikaner nation, appealing to the emotion and the religiosity of his audience while not making a secret of his disdain for the democratic system, the British and the supposed threat that the native South African poses to the Afrikaner 'Volk'. And now that he rules South Africa, it is no longer just rhetoric."

### Focuses ###
#Regular
SAF_black_monday_crisis:0 "A Response to Black Monday"
SAF_black_monday_crisis_desc:0 "The economic crisis threatens to tear the Union apart. We must reform our country's economy to solve mass unemployment, but the Volksraad stands divided on the path to take forwards. This choice will certainly have repercussions in the years to come, and may even exacerbate existing divides."
SAF_repeal_industrial_conciliation_act:0 "Repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act"
SAF_repeal_industrial_conciliation_act_desc:0 "The Industrial Conciliation Act was a direct reaction to the Rand Rebellion in 1922 and gave white trade unions privileges that are slowing economic recovery. The Act must be repealed, and the unions must be brought to heel if we are to get the nation’s economy back on track. This will obviously be extremely unpopular with white workers."
SAF_attract_canadian_investment:0 "Attract Canadian Investment"
SAF_attract_canadian_investment_desc:0 "By encouraging Canadian investment, we will give our economy the influx of capital that it desperately needs while also hopefully providing thousands of jobs to our struggling workforce."
SAF_weaken_the_colour_bar:0 "Opportunities for the Unemployed"
SAF_weaken_the_colour_bar_desc:0 "Be it through the use of bailouts or investment, slowly but surely the amount of jobs in South Africa is climbing out of its lowest point. As more and more people have a job again, they can also spend a bit again, which goes to the benefit of other sectors in the economy."
SAF_invest_in_witwatersrand_industry:0 "The Witwatersrand Roars Again!"
SAF_invest_in_witwatersrand_industry_desc:0 "The mineral wealth in the Witwatersrand has been a commercial safety net during the economic crisis. While it has been hurt as much as any other part of the South African economy by this crisis, it is clearly starting to reach pre-crisis levels again, pushing our economy to recovery with it."
SAF_establish_work_programs:0 "Establish Work Programs"
SAF_establish_work_programs_desc:0 "A series of work programs for the unemployed is a safe bet for economic recovery and consequently has general support in the party with exception to the hardline unionists within the SAP."
SAF_bail_out_farmers:0 "Farmer Bail Out"
SAF_bail_out_farmers_desc:0 "The ongoing crisis is a time of suffering for all people of South Africa, but the heaviest burden is without a doubt being carried by our farmers. Rock-bottom prices are necessitating bail outs for both internal producers and exporters aimed at saving our agricultural sector from collapse."
SAF_large_scale_roadworks:0 "Large-Scale Roadworks"
SAF_large_scale_roadworks_desc:0 "The nation is in dire need of better roads even in its Southern territories. The high unemployment rates because of Black Monday now give us the manpower to link up Natal, Transvaal, and Cape provinces while also providing jobs to thousands."
SAF_sa_arms_industry:0 "South African Arms Industry"
SAF_sa_arms_industry_desc:0 "One way that we can put people to work is by expanding our military infrastructure. We have the natural resources to develop our military – now all we need is the will to do it."
SAF_complete_recovery:0 "Complete the Recovery"
SAF_complete_recovery_desc:0 "Finally, we are able to put Black Monday behind us once and for all. Let us move forward into an era of strength for the South African economy!"
SAF_deal_with_the_protectorates:0 "Deal with the Protectorates"
SAF_deal_with_the_protectorates_desc:0 "Following the collapse of the British Empire in 1925, the duty to garrison the High Commissioner Territories passed to the Union Defence Force. Since then, the region has stagnated. Elements within the South African government propose we reassess our relationship with the territories."
SAF_establish_nuweveld:0 "Establish the Nuweveld"
SAF_establish_nuweveld_desc:0 "Turning the newly annexed territories over to white settlers will encourage the establishment of new settlements throughout the Nuweveld and the cultural integration of the new regions. The locals, however, would lose access to most agricultural lands, forcing them to migrate to the cities for work as transient labour."
SAF_encourage_farmer_resettlement:0 "Encourage Farmer Settlement"
SAF_encourage_farmer_resettlement_desc:0 "The financial plight of our farmers presents us with a unique opportunity to apply the Nuweveldt project. If we can encourage resettlement to the ranges of Bechuanaland, we can turn the economic crisis into an opportunity for thousands of destitute white farmers."
SAF_long_term_investment_loans:0 "Long-Standing Investment Loans"
SAF_long_term_investment_loans_desc:0 "By providing guaranteed loans we can provide a low-cost incentive for entrepreneurs across the nation to move to the newly alotted lands in Bechuanaland."
SAF_build_the_kariba_dam:0 "Prepare to build the Kariba Dam"
SAF_build_the_kariba_dam_desc:0 "Finishing the Kariba Dam will be long and arduous work, but it will provide plenty of energy for our growing industry in Rhodesia and the settlements springing out from the colonisation of the Nuweveld."
SAF_annex_the_protectorates:0 "Annex the Protectorates"
SAF_annex_the_protectorates_desc:0 "It is time to end the Protectorates. After the successful implementation of the Nuweveldt project we can easily bring the territories under our direct control. The British treaties with the natives will be cast aside and the paramount chiefs will be dethroned. The time of a united South Africa is upon us!"
SAF_stellaland_affairs_act:0 "Stellaland Affairs Act"
SAF_stellaland_affairs_act_desc:0 "The integration of the former Protectorates will require formal, albeit mostly symbolic legislation. Basutoland and Swaziland will be integrated into the Cape Province and Transvaal respectively, but Bechuanaland will be admitted as the province of Stellaland in honor of the former Boer Republic."
SAF_expand_nuweveld_infra:0 "Expand the Outer Rail Connection"
SAF_expand_nuweveld_infra_desc:0 "Developing the infrastructure of Nuweveldt lands will not only encourage settlement but also ensure that the lands are finally being put to a productive use."
SAF_new_towns_and_villages:0 "Towns and Villages Spring Up"
SAF_new_towns_and_villages_desc:0 "The founding of new urban centers will encourage city workers to migrate into the Nuweveldt alongside our rural workers and increase our total population in these areas."
SAF_diversified_territorial_economy:0 "Diversified Territorial Economy"
SAF_diversified_territorial_economy_desc:0 "Striving for a diversified economy for the Nuweveldt territories can only help their economic growth which will in turn attract more settlers."
SAF_empower_paramount_chiefs:0 "Empower the Paramount Chiefs"
SAF_empower_paramount_chiefs_desc:0 "Granting autonomy to the local rulers of the High Commissioner Territories will ensure the Paramount Chiefs of their respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland) shall be loyal to the central government."
SAF_develop_basutoland_swaziland:0 "Develop Basutoland and Swaziland"
SAF_develop_basutoland_swaziland_desc:0 "Despite their location between the original four provinces of South Africa, the living standard in Basutoland and Swaziland still immensely lags behind that of the rest of South Africa. A series of investments will aid in resolving this situation."
SAF_develop_bechuanaland:0 "Develop Bechuanaland"
SAF_develop_bechuanaland_desc:0 "The sparsely populated region of Bechuanaland is without hyperbolics the least developed region in all of Africa, with any kind of construction remaining limited to a few wooden huts in most places. A series of well-placed investments will soften the contrast with South Africa just over the border."
SAF_root_out_slavery:0 "Root Out Slavery Practices"
SAF_root_out_slavery_desc:0 "Slavery has long proven difficult to root out of the High Commissioner Territories, but the recent investment gives us leverage with the paramount chiefs to resolve the persisting issues, by making investments dependent on their action on slavery."
SAF_question_of_native_autonomy:0 "Question of Native Autonomy"
SAF_question_of_native_autonomy_desc:0 "We have decided to grant autonomy to the local rulers of the High Commission Territories, the new Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs power - is it limited to within the borders of the HCT or does it encompass all of their peoples throughout South Africa?"
SAF_strengthen_advisory_councils:0 "Strengthen the Advisory Councils"
SAF_strengthen_advisory_councils_desc:0 "By strengthening the influence of the advisory councils on policy, we can assure that the interests of the Paramount Chief is at least somewhat balanced with both the European and native interests. It will also lay the groundwork for eventual reform into a bona fide democratic framework in the future."
SAF_chief_justice_of_the_high_commissioner_territories:0 "Form the Territorial Justice System"
SAF_chief_justice_of_the_high_commissioner_territories_desc:0 "At current the status of the law in the High Commissioner Territories is rather vague, members of the tribes are usually tried according to their own tribal traditions while Europeans are tried as if they were in South African territory, with certain exceptions. It is time we formalise a system with trained justices specifically to ensure fair trials for everyone in the territories."
SAF_reform_the_commissioner_system:0 "Reform the Commissioner System"
SAF_reform_the_commissioner_system_desc:0 "We have made our fair investments in the High Commissioner Territories, but at current we still merely have a temporary mandate from the royal government. In parliament in Cape Town proposals are made to pursue the official and permanent inclusion of the territories within South Africa, but the British exile government would need to cooperate."
SAF_general_elections:0 "The Union's Affairs"
SAF_general_elections_desc:0 "The elections are over and a mandate is to be fulfilled. Let us put our affairs in order, and then move on to the order of the day."
SAF_proclaim_the_republic:0 "Proclaim the Republic"
SAF_proclaim_the_republic_desc:0 "For too long the Afrikaans people and South Africa at large have been subjected to the will of a monarchy that is not their own. It is time we move on from this chapter in history and establish a fully independent and sovereign Republic of South Africa, which has the interest of South Africa at heart, rather than that of the British."
SAF_replace_the_pound:0 "Replace the Pound"
SAF_replace_the_pound_desc:0 "Since we are now a fully sovereign and independent nation, it will not do any longer to make use of a currency intrinsically tied to a British past and tied to the Pound Sterling. Let us introduce our own South African Rand - tied to the Witwatersrand, where we find our gold - and thrive in our independent future."
SAF_reorganise_the_national_party:0 "Reorganize the National Party"
SAF_reorganise_the_national_party_desc:0 "Dr. Malan, the pathetic constitutionalist barrister, is allowing our Afrikaner destiny to be held back with this insistence to adhere to the South African constitution, binding us to worthless parliamentary procedures and endangering our nation's hold on power in South Africa in the process. If only a decisive and unrelenting figure could just do away with parliamentarism and the liberals that thrive in it..."
SAF_implement_apartheid:0 "Implement Apartheid"
SAF_implement_apartheid_desc:0 "After a period of consolidation, we are now in a position to strengthen existing segregation laws to bring about full separation of the four South African nations both socially and politically. The Volksraad is behind us and set to carry our governments programme through."
SAF_independent_perspective:0 "An Independent Perspective"
SAF_independent_perspective_desc:0 "We are a free and independent country now, not beholden to the will of Britain to sacrifice Afrikaner men to reverse their own failures at home, or to bully our German brethren, who have never done us wrong. Yet, as an independent South Africa pursuing South African interests, we are not against allies."
SAF_retreat_from_european_affairs:0 "Retreat from European Affairs"
SAF_retreat_from_european_affairs_desc:0 "General Smuts dragged us into the Weltkrieg, sending Afrikaners to die in the cold mud of a land alien to their own to further the imperial interest of an island that was not their own either. Now that South Africa is a free and independent country, we will cease to involve ourselves in the petty squabbles of the European powers."
SAF_native_representation_act:0 "The Native Representation Act"
SAF_native_representation_act_desc:0 "A long-term Nationalist goal has been to remove native South Africans from the voting rolls and to allow them to vote for three separate white members of the Volksraad instead of pooling their property-qualified vote into South Africa's general electorate. The time to implement this plan is now!"
SAF_gerrymander_districts:0 "Gerrymander the Districts"
SAF_gerrymander_districts_desc:0 "Troublingly, we are having trouble in getting a majority of the electorate to support us, and we mainly owe our hold over the government to the fact that rural constituencies are overrepresented compared to urban constituencies. Perhaps if we slightly redraw the borders, we can ensure this situation remains locked down in our favour."
SAF_flags_amendment_act:0 "Flags Amendment Act"
SAF_flags_amendment_act_desc:0 "It is the result of compromise that South Africa, proud nation as it is, needs to fly the Union Jack, a symbol of oppression by Britain, next to its national flag in official capacity. This act will ensure that our national flag will no longer see competition from the British national flag."
SAF_expel_rensburg_pirow:0 "Expel Johannes van Rensburg"
SAF_expel_rensburg_pirow_desc:0 "The power-hungry and paramilitary former administrator of the Orange Free State, Johannes van Rensburg, has been plotting to unconstitutionally seize the apparatus of state for himself for years now. It is time we distance ourselves from this shady figure by revoking his party membership."
SAF_coloured_enfranchisement_act:0 "'Coloured' Enfranchisement Act"
SAF_coloured_enfranchisement_act_desc:0 "Of all racial groups in South Africa, the mixed race 'Coloured' group is definitely the one seen as the closest to an equal by the South Africa's white European population. The first step towards gradually turning South Africa in a truly comprehensive democracy would be to abolish the property qualifications of this community in the Cape and Rhodesia, while extending franchise to them in the other provinces."
SAF_native_trust_and_land_act:0 "Native Trust and Land Act"
SAF_native_trust_and_land_act_desc:0 "The Native Trust and Land Act increases the designated 8% of South African land which has been reserved for South Africa's native population to approximately 13% of South Africa's territory. This measure will mean that land currently owned by whites will have to be bought by the government, a process that can take years, if not decades."
SAF_asiatic_land_tenure_act:0 "Asiatic Land Tenure Act"
SAF_asiatic_land_tenure_act_desc:0 "Conservatives within our party, especially those based in Natal, consider that Indian merchants are posing a threat to the white community by outcompeting their stores, both among whites and natives. They would like to ensure that white South Africans can secure their position by limiting the land which can be owned by Indians to certain designated areas."
SAF_natives_consolidation_act:0 "Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act"
SAF_natives_consolidation_act_desc:0 "For a long time, we have been using pass laws to prevent native South Africans from encroaching on our urban areas, which are inhabited by white South Africans. The following act has been proposed by the conservatives to refine the pass laws and ensure that the privileged position of the urban whites can be maintained."
SAF_vaalhart_irrigation_scheme:0 "Complete the Vaalhart Irrigation Scheme"
SAF_vaalhart_irrigation_scheme_desc:0 "The Orange Free State, Northern Cape and Transvaal regions of South Africa are quite dry and therefore less suitable for agriculture. By building an extensive irrigation system out of the Vaal river we can ensure that our farms receive enough water for a good output of agricultural produce."
SAF_expand_krugerpark:0 "Expand the Krugerpark"
SAF_expand_krugerpark_desc:0 "The Krugerpark is a wildlife reserve with its roots in the Sabi Game Reserve of the South African Republic (commonly known as the (boer republic of) Transvaal). In recent years it has attracted a modest amount of tourism from both the English and German spheres of influence who seem enthousiastic about the wildlife rail tours through the national park."
SAF_enact_smuts_doctrine:0 "Recover British Africa"
SAF_enact_smuts_doctrine_desc:0 "In the darkest hour of the empire, the revolution of 1925, the vile Germans illegally occupied most of British Africa, only leaving alone South Africa, the High Commisioner Territories, Gambia and Sierra Leone. Generals Pierre van Ryneveld and Jan Smuts have put together a plan to bring back at least the relatively easily accessible colonies of Northern Rhodesia and East Africa in the imperial fold."
SAF_fire_broeders:0 "Fire 'Broeder' Civil Servants"
SAF_fire_broeders_desc:0 "The Afrikaner Broederbond, a secret society of Afrikaners, posing as a cultural organisation encompassing many prominent South African politicians, soldiers and civil servants, has sought to push Afrikaner issues and rule South Africa from behind the curtains since its foundation. It is time we curtail the influence of these secretive men by requiring all of our civil servants to distance from them."
SAF_asiatic_enfranchisement_act:0 "Asiatic Enfranchisement Act"
SAF_asiatic_enfranchisement_act_desc:0 "The Asiatic racial group of South Africa, comprised of Cape Malays who have been here since Dutch rule and Indian indentured workers introduced mainly in Natal, but also in the Transvaal and Cape province, form only a small fraction of the South African population, but most of them are currently denied the right to vote under similar conditions as the native majority. It is time to abolish these restrictions."
SAF_found_sabc:0 "Found the SABC"
SAF_found_sabc_desc:0 "Radio broadcasters have been active in South Africa since 1923, but South Africa has so far lacked a national radio network. As such, voices have risen in Pretoria to officially establish a 'South African Broadcasting Corporation', or, in Afrikaans, 'Suid-Afrikaanse Uitsaaikorporasie', which will broadcast two radio services: one in English, and one in Afrikaans."
SAF_fund_stellenbosch:0 "Fund Stellenbosch University"
SAF_fund_stellenbosch_desc:0 "The 'Universiteit Stellenbosch' or the 'Stellenbosch University' is, together with the University of Cape Town, the oldest extant university in sub-saharan Africa. The university, which is certainly the most high profile of the nation, almost exclusively teaches in Afrikaans, and serves as somewhat of an intellectual hub for the National Party. Investing in them will increase our research capability."
SAF_fund_cape_town_uni:0 "Fund the University of the Witwatersrand"
SAF_fund_cape_town_uni_desc:0 "While not quite as classic as the Cape Town and Stellenbosch Universities, the University of Witwatersrand, founded by J.H. Hofmeyr, is certainly innovative. The university is multi-racial and as such (and through its founder), closely associated with the South African Party."
SAF_join_isac:0 "Form the South African Mathematical Society"
SAF_join_isac_desc:0 "The South African Mathematical Society is a group of South African intellectuals, who, contrary to the name of the society, deal not only in mathematics but also physics and other such endeavors."
SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion:0 "Focus on Agricultural Expansion"
SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion_desc:0 "Our history is rooted in the exploits of the farmers who came to South Africa. It would be foolish to throw our cash into the pockets of the already rich English capitalists, who are ever hungry for workers to exploit, those workers being the Africans when the Afrikaners become too expensive. Agriculture is the strength of our nation and the root of our culture."
SAF_subsidized_farming:0 "Subsidized Farming"
SAF_subsidized_farming_desc:0 "One way to support our hardworking farmers is to hand out subsidies, allowing them to perhaps expand their lands a bit, take better precautions against wildlife aiming to attack their livestock, and investing in new machinery."
SAF_support_cape_wineries:0 "Support Cape Wineries"
SAF_support_cape_wineries_desc:0 "The mediterranean climate of the Cape is perfect for the cultivation of wine grapes, and as such, South African wine is world-renowned. We should make use of this export boon, and support our wineries in their endeavours."
SAF_encourage_sharecropping:0 "Encourage Sharecropping"
SAF_encourage_sharecropping_desc:0 "Sharecropping holds that a landowner allows a tenant to farm on his land in return for a part of the produce. Many Afrikaner farmers are unable to work all of their stretched land of our outstretched nation. It would be economically responsible to encourage them to allow sharecroppers to work this excess land."
SAF_agricultural_innovation:0 "Agricultural Innovation"
SAF_agricultural_innovation_desc:0 "South Africa is a western nation, but also a nation of agriculture. It is only natural that we have are developing a significant edge on agricultural technology compared to other countries, and we can leverage this innovativeness into other fields of Research and Development."
SAF_help_small_farming_communities:0 "Aid Small Farming Communities"
SAF_help_small_farming_communities_desc:0 "When crisis strikes, small farming communities who are unable to offset their goods are often the first victims. It is our responsibility as a government to protect these vulnerable farmers, and we could do that by subsidising their endeavours."
SAF_industrial_farming_equipment:0 "Industrial Farming Equipment"
SAF_industrial_farming_equipment_desc:0 "The Industrial revolution did not only revolutionise industrial efforts but also revolutionised agriculture. We have the means, so we could definitely increase our agricultural efficiency by investing in this kind of machinery."
SAF_granary_of_africa:0 "The Granary of Africa"
SAF_granary_of_africa_desc:0 "Our agricultural achievements have not gone without notice: South African bread is exported through the continent and beyond, feeding colonist and colonial alike. As such, South Africa is quickly becoming known as the Granary of Africa."
SAF_south_african_gold:0 "South Africa's Gold"
SAF_south_african_gold_desc:0 "South Africa has significant gold reserves. The presence of gold means we have the means to back up our currency and it's something other countries desire for a similar goal. It would be foolish not to exploit the money that lies below our soil."
SAF_focus_on_manufacturing:0 "Focus on Industrial Expansion"
SAF_focus_on_manufacturing_desc:0 "In the late 19th century, the industrial revolution has truly taken root in South Africa. The combination of natural resources and manpower to work the factories sets South Africa up perfectly to become an industrial powerhouse, while the rest of the continent still digs through the dirt!"
SAF_director_general_van_der_bijl:0 "Appoint Van der Bijl as Director-General"
SAF_director_general_van_der_bijl_desc:0 "Hendrik van der Bijl, the founder of numerous companies, like the Eskom, our electricity company, and the Iron and Steel Corporation of South Africa (ISCOR), is perfectly suited to make our industrial base ready for wartime production needs."
SAF_form_idc_of_south_africa:0 "Form the IDC of South Africa"

SAF_recruit_native_labour_desc:0 "While the Afrikaners and white labourers may resent the encroachment of natives on our industrial zones, the reality is that the white labour pool is simply too small to optimally use the industrial potential of South Africa. With the entire workforce available, we are well on our way to become one of the foremost industrial nations of the world."

SAF_great_repairshop_desc:0 "Our industry has rapidly evolved over the last years to enable us to properly support a long-term war effort.

SAF_segregation_question:0 "Abolish Formal Segregation"
SAF_segregation_question_desc:0 "Long have the capitalists-imperialists been using simplistic racial rhetoric to convince the white proletarian that his black comrade would be his adversary, allowing them to entrench their own interests and falsifying a sense of need for collaboration by the white worker. It is time we abolish the legislation designed to keep us in their hands."
SAF_herald_syndicate_autonomy:0 "Herald Syndicate Autonomy"
SAF_herald_syndicate_autonomy_desc:0 "While the common catchphrase 'Workers of the world unite!' seems incompatible with the notion of treating certain workers differently from others, the basis of our state are the trade unions, and some of those trade unions want to reserve access to their membership.

SAF_la_guma_administration_desc:0 "As had been assessed long ago, the white proletariat has shown its true colours: they have developed a bourgeoise sense of superiority, and their 'revolution' unsurprisingly proved to be a farce. It has been long overdue that we cut the English and Dutch out of the government. South Africa for South AFRICANS!"
SAF_land_restitution:0 "Land Restitution"
SAF_land_restitution_desc:0 "The colonisers have driven the South Africans from their land, confining them to a wholly unfulfilling 8% of South African soil, forcing our people into famine and overpopulation in a nation that is more than large enough for our people.

SAF_native_empowerment_program:0 "Native Empowerment Program"
SAF_native_empowerment_program_desc:0 "The whites, ever anxious to lose their position, have spent their time limiting access to education and training to themselves, leaving us to scrub the floor clean.

SAF_native_republic:0 "The Native Republic"
SAF_native_republic_desc:0 "With the sweeping reforms enacted by La Guma's government, South Africa once again belongs to the South African people, rather than a minority of Europeans pretending a South African identity who lord us around.

SAF_outlaw_colour_bars:0 "Outlaw Colour Bars"
SAF_outlaw_colour_bars_desc:0 "Colour Bars, meant to prevent cheaper black workers from replacing white workers, are an outdated concept now. Every South African is a brother to one another in our move towards socialism and the vile profit motive has been quashed. Such discriminatory measures are nothing but shameful and can't be left in place."
SAF_restrict_internal_migration:0 "Restrict Internal Migration"
SAF_restrict_internal_migration_desc:0 "As much as we reject the racially based pass laws of the minority regime, one cannot deny the reality that without any restrictions rural South Africans would swarm Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, overpopulating the townships and living in squalor.

SAF_urban_housing_program:0 "Urban Housing Expansion"
SAF_urban_housing_program_desc:0 "Our loosening of migration restrictions on urban areas has, as could be expected, resulted in a giant inflow from South Africa's less developed rural areas of South Africans looking for new opportunities. Unfortunately our housing facilities can't keep up to the demand and the new migrants live in squalor as a result. The only option left is to build more housing facilities, and building them fast."
SAF_diversify_higher_education:0 "Diversify Higher Education"
SAF_diversify_higher_education_desc:0 "Traditionally our institutions of higher education have been quite hostile to non-white students, preferring to gate themselves off and leaving non-whites little choice but to go to less prestigious education facilities.

SAF_seize_industrial_capital_desc:0 "Since the discovery of natural resources in the rand and the western Cape, South Africa has steadily grown into possibly the lone industrial state in Africa.

SAF_tolerate_small_farming_enterprises_desc:0 "While nothing but our wrath shall be directed to the corporations attempting to monopolise the most precious tenet of a civilisation: the food supply, it would not be fair to deprive small family businesses of their livelihood on this basis.

SAF_nationalize_all_farms:0 "Nationalize Our Agrarian Potential"
SAF_nationalize_all_farms_desc:0 "Capitalists have taken our farmlands for themselves and sell food, the most fundamental need of the human being, for profit.

SAF_durban_convention:0 "The Durban Convention"
SAF_durban_convention_desc:0 "We have made tremendous strides in the last few years: the Larneys have been crushed, racial affairs have been made more equitable and South Africa for perhaps the first time since the concept exists, belongs to the South African.

### Events ###
saf.1.t:0 "The Union of South Africa"
saf.1.d:0 "Formed in 1910 as a merger of the various British possessions in South Africa - the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange Free State - after the second Boer war, the Union of South Africa remains as the last remnant of British presence in Africa.\n\nBut the dominion is wavering: the white Afrikaner population yearns back to the independence of the Boer republics of old, while on the other side of the political spectrum syndicalism, already influential in the region since before the Commune of France or the Union of Britain materialized, is creeping into the minds of the impoverished underclass, of every racial group, who are chafing under the effects of the economic downturn.\n\nThe Union's politics revolve around a two party system: the South African Party of general Jan Smuts, and the National Party of general J.B.M. Hertzog. A smaller party, the Labour Party, currently divided in two opposing factions, also holds a presence in the South African Parliament. Between 1924 and 1929, they ruled with the National Party in a coalition government, but after their failure to tame the Great Depression, the South African Party secured a majority again, first with the help of breakaway Nationalists, and then, after 1933, after being credited for relieving the effects of the Great Depression, on its own."
saf.1.a:0 "Union is Strength."
saf.2.t:0 "The South Africa Act"
saf.2.d:0 "The South Africa Act of 1909 passed by Westminster serves as the Union's constitution: the Union of South Africa is a unitary state, rather than a federation, with each colony's parliaments abolished and replaced with provincial councils.\n\nThe national Parliament consists of two parts: the Volksraad and Senate. The Volksraad members are elected mostly by the country's white minority under first past the post, although the franchise varies depending upon the province. In the Cape and Southern Rhodesia, a qualified franchise based upon property and education requirements is in place, while the vote is white-only everywhere else. The Senate is appointed by an electoral college consisting of members of each of the five Provincial Councils and members of the Volksraad. The government follows the Westminster model, and is appointed by the Governor-General of South Africa, presently the Earl of Clarendon.\n\nSouth Africa has been administering Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland as protectorates in the place of Britain ever since the British revolution in the 1920s, while Southern Rhodesia has been admitted as a province of the union in 1922."
saf.2.a:0 "I see."
saf.3.t:0 "Black Monday Hits South Africa"
saf.3.d:0 "A week ago, the German stock market collapsed, plunging the world into depression. Since the advent of the great depression of 1925, the pact government in power at the time - a coalition of the National Party and the Labour Party, a smaller party of chiefly English-speaking white miners - elected to deepen the trade ties with the still prosperous Germany to limit the effects of the crisis, with limited success. The Smuts-Roos government that came into power in 1929 kept these arrangement in place, and as such, the woes of Black Monday did not skip South Africa.\n\nThe crisis has had a terrible effect upon the South African economy, unemployment has risen markedly as many companies that depended upon the German export market have gone out of business or laid off white workers in favour of cheaper native labour."
saf.3.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
saf.4.t:0 "The Industrialist Lobby"
saf.4.d:0 "In the first decade of the dominion, South Africa's political system had been made up out of the Afrikaner-led South African Party and the smaller British-led Unionist Party, the party of the English-speaking mining magnates the likes of Cecil Rhodes and Leander Starr Jameson. When the National Party rose and republican sentiments along with it, in combination with a unionist decline, they eventually agreed to merge into the South African Party. This SAP wing has persisted during the last 15 years.\n\nToday a group of unionist-inclined MPs, accompanied by several business leaders have come to appeal to prime minister Smuts to repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act passed by the Pact Government in 1925. The act affords several significant protections to the white worker which according to the business leaders cannot be sustained with the present crisis again pushing South African companies into the corner just after the effects of the Great Depression has worn off."
saf.4.a:0 "I assure you, the economy is our foremost concern!"
saf.5.t:0 "Unionists Join the Opposition"
saf.5.d:0 "The government's decision not to repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act in its strategy of resolving the effects of the black monday crisis has not gone down well with Unionists among our ranks. The minister of Commerce and Industry has resigned over our decision and eight MPs have left our parliamentary group, robbing us of our parliamentary majority.\n\nGiven our newfound lack of a working majority, tabling our package of measures against the crisis in the Volksraad would undoubtedly fail."
saf.5.a:0 "We will need to open talks with the opposition!"
saf.6.t:0 "Finding a Majority"
saf.6.d:0 "With the Unionist withdrawal, the first outright SAP majority since 1921 has disappeared almost as quickly as it appeared in 1933. Prime Minister Smuts now needs to swiftly make a decision on how to proceed, because government action is necessary to alleviate the suffering caused by Black Monday.\n\nThe first option for the prime minister is to open coalition talks with the SAP's classical rivals, the National Party. There are profound differences between these two parties but if such talks would succeed the coalition would have an overwhelming majority in the Volksraad.\n\nSecondly, a deal could be reached with the National Council faction of the split Labour party led by Walter Madeley. They would likely be inclined to support the common-man oriented approach we had in mind and finding common ground with them would likely be much easier than with National.\n\nThen, we can decide to continue as a minority government as if nothing happened and seek out support on a per-motion basis. The unionists are likely deterred from bringing us down through a motion of no confidence as they have no party structure to defend their seats anymore. We could then likely negotiate with Labour on some bills and our lost Unionists on others, but this will leave the government without a stable majority at this crucial time.\n\nThen, finally, we can request that the governor-general dissolves the Volksraad and calls early elections, but of course this carries the risk of a victory by the National Party and would mean there would be no government able to counteract Black Monday for the coming weeks."
saf.6.a:0 "Open talks with Hertzog"
saf.6.b:0 "Schedule a meeting with Madeley Labour"
saf.6.c:0 "We will continue as a minority government"
saf.6.e:0 "Ask the governor-general to call new elections"
saf.7.t:0 "Coalition Talks with National"
saf.7.d:0 "Prime Minister Smuts has chosen to engage in coalition talks with general Hertzog and his National Party. Acutely aware of his own weakened position within his party due to his failure so far to regain the office of prime minister after losing it in 1929, general Hertzog, while exhibiting a willingness to engage, seems determined to reach a compromise which will be beneficial to his party.\n\nAfter two weeks of vigourous negotiation, the differences as well as the similarities of the two parties come to light. It appears that general Hertzog is willing to help out the SAP and even abstain from pursuing further nationalist goals until this Volksraad's term is up in 1938 'for the good of the country and Afrikanerdom' on two conditions: the first is that he, James Hertzog, will come to be prime minister of this coalition government. A somewhat arrogant stance to take as the leader of the smaller parliamentary party, but one that is when it comes to it most likely largely symbolic. His second demand is probably the more controversial one: to ease the suffering of Black Monday among the white Afrikaner farmers that form his support base he wants to set up the so-called 'Nuweveld Project' which would open up the Bechuanaland protectorate which South Africa garrisons on behalf of the British exile government for the settlement of white farmers. This would be in violation of the treaties signed by Britain with the Tswana chiefdoms and likely be regarded as a heavy breach of trust by Canada."

saf.7.c:0 "If this is what it takes, we prefer a minority government"
saf.7.e:0 "No deal! Parliament should be dissolved!"
saf.8.t:0 "Talks with Labour"
saf.8.d:0 "Prime Minister Smuts has chosen to engage in coalition talks with Walter Madeley and his National Council faction of the Labour Party. The small South African Labour Party with a support base of chiefly white English-speaking miners has been split eversince Madeley was removed from his cabinet position in the Pact Government by general Hertzog with the support of Labour leader Frederic Creswell for associating with the syndicalist and interracial Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union. Since then Madeley has been disputing the position of leader of the party with Creswell.\n\nAfter about a week of negotiation it appears they would join happily a coalition government with the SAP on the simple conditions that N.C. Labour receives two cabinet positions and affirmation that we will indeed be taking a common man-oriented approach to Black Monday. This agreement could've been highly troubling to the unionist wing of our party, but given they now left our ranks this should not pose a problem."
saf.8.a:0 "An SAP-Labour cabinet will fulfill this term!"
saf.8.b:0 "This is unacceptable, let us talk with Hertzog!"
saf.8.c:0 "If this is what it takes, we prefer a minority government"
saf.8.e:0 "No deal! Parliament should be dissolved!"
saf.9.t:0 "The Governor-General Dissolves the Volksraad"
saf.9.d:0 "The Unionist walk-out as a result of disagreements over the strategy with regards to black monday has resulted in a cabinet crisis. Robbed of a working majority in the Volksraad, prime minister Smuts has asked the Earl of Clarendon to dissolve the Volksraad and call new elections six weeks from now. Since the response to Black Monday was obviously not on the table in 1933 and makes for an entirely new situation, the governor-general swiftly followed the advice of the prime minister and dissolved the Volksraad.\n\nA rough campaigning season is expected in the coming six weeks as the effects of Black Monday will befall more and more South Africans. Jan Smuts will likely be campaigning on his credentials in alleviating the effects of the Great Depression, while James Hertzog will likely once again start a scaremonger among South African whites about the prospects of increasing native influence on politics and paint Smuts as a puppet of the mining magnates of the Rand who has allowed this to happen."
saf.9.a:0 "The government needs a clear mandate to deliver relief!"
saf.10.t:0 "The 1936 Elections"
saf.10.d:0 "It has been six weeks since elections have been called and the (white) South Africans are going to the polls to cast their vote. In the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia they are joined by non-whites who meet certain property and education qualifications. The outcome of this election will likely decide who will rule South Africa for the next five years: will general Smuts reclaim the majority he won in 1933, or will general Hertzog finally reclaim the office of Prime Minister for himself after seven long years in the opposition?"
saf.10.a:0 "The SAP reclaims its working majority once again!"
saf.10.b:0 "National claims a decisive majority!"
saf.11.t:0 "The Extent of Native Autonomy"
saf.11.d:0 "We have decided to formalize the autonomy of the local rulers of the former High Commissioner Territories, the Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs' power - is it limited to within the borders of the former HCT, or does it encompass all of their people throughout South Africa?"
saf.11.a:0 "Their authority stops at the border."
saf.11.b:0 "They will fully represent their people."
saf.12.t:0 "The Third Smuts Cabinet Continues"
saf.12.d:0 "The gamble of calling an election has been a resounding success: the South African electorate has clearly and decisively spoken out its approval of the government's plans to carry South Africa out of the suffering brought upon us by Black Monday. The SAP has secured itself a working majority in the Volksraad and the unionists, who have been reduced to two seats as independents are no longer needed to this end, allowing the cabinet to continue another five year term, with no need to compromise with the opposition."
saf.12.a:0 "Hurrah!"
saf.13.t:0 "The Second Hertzog Cabinet Inaugurated"
saf.13.d:0 "Smuts' gamble of calling elections in the middle of the rising Black Monday crisis has clearly backfired spectacularly. For the first time since 1929, the National Party is once again the larger of the two Afrikaner parties, and Hertzog is set to once again occupy the office of prime minister with a full mandate to deliver the National party program. National has achieved a working majority on its own, but the Creswell faction of the Labour party, who had been our allies during the 1924-1929 term, have expressed interest in joining the cabinet once again. They are not strictly necessary to govern, but it might be beneficial to secure their support if we were to lose our working majority in the future like Smuts has found out just now." 
saf.13.a:0 "South Africa needs a stable single-party cabinet!"
saf.13.b:0 "Reconstitute the Pact Government"
saf.14.t:0 "The Opposition Rallies against the Repeal!"
saf.14.d:0 "We have just tabled our proposed repeal of the Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924. The Nationalist opposition has decried us as 'proving to be sockpuppets of Hoggenheimer once more', referring to the personification of the English-speaking capitalists in cartoons in the Afrikaner newspaper 'die Burger' and the smaller Labour contingent, normally divided between their National Council and Creswell faction, has joined them unanimously in condemning our suggestion. But this matters little, since the SAP holds the majority in the Volksraad.\n\nMore ominous is the situation in the streets: the International Socialist League has condemned our motion and called for a general strike. Not everyone is inclined to follow their rabble-rousing, but several large mines in the Witwatersrand are completely on lockdown now. For the owners, this may be a setback that cannot be overcome in combination with the crisis if we do not act soon."
saf.14.a:0 "Let them send in their strikebreakers!"
saf.14.b:0 "Stand back, let us wait them out!"
saf.15.t:0 "Riots in Benoni"
saf.15.d:0 "The decision to send in strikebreakers seems to have inflamed the situation. The strikers assaulted the trucks beloaded with their replacements, leading to police intervention, which in turn developed into a riot. In the Rand mining town of Benoni, which was also a hotspot in the 1922 revolt, armed rioters have forced the police to retreat from the town entirely, while elsewhere, in the town of Brakpan and several suburbs of Johannesburg, rioters are taking control block by block!\n\nTo make matters worse, news of the brutalities have reached outside the Rand, and strikes in solidarity with them are being called among dockworkers in Durban and Cape Town. With the scope of the crisis quickly growing to the meet the one of 1922."
saf.15.a:0 "This is getting out of hand!"
saf.16.t:0 "The Second Rand Revolt"
saf.16.d:0 "The crisis is quickly growing and even starts to exceed the problems on 1922: unlike back then, revolting workers are also securing ever-increasing control over Durban and Cape Town, and in Johannesburg the majority of the city has fallen under worker control. In Pretoria, panic among functionaries is rising, and parallels are being drawn between the mining strike in Wales in 1925 and the one that caused this crisis. Prime Minister Smuts remains calm under the circumstances however, arguing that, unlike in Britain, these white strikers have very little ability to project power into the South African hinterland. The cabinet debates two options: sending in the military immediately, which should quickly pacify the crisis like in 1922 but would likely come at a large cost of lives on both sides, or to use the military purely in a defensive manner, which would undoubtedly end the strikers' advance, allowing us to isolate them. They can hardly maintain this position for long and will then hopefully surrender."
saf.16.a:0 "An immediate military response is necessary!"
saf.16.b:0 "Stop and isolate them, they will soon surrender!"
saf.17.t:0 "The Battle of Mayfair"
saf.17.d:0 "Early in the morning, some 20.000 troops of the UDF poured into Johannesburg on the orders of Jan Smuts. With the full use of bombing runs by the airforce the strikers were quickly driven back, until they dug in in the Johannesburg suburb of Mayfair. A bloody fight was the result, and at the end of it more than 350 strikers lay dead, and at least 60 UDF troops. Following the battle significant amounts of strikers dispersed, and later within days order was restored in most of the Rand. Following the news of the brutal massacre in Mayfair, the strikers in Durban and Cape Town also dispersed without further violence.\n\nThe crisis is under control, but these events will likely go down as a dark page of South African history."
saf.17.a:0 "At least it is over."
saf.18.t:0 "The ICU Acts!"
saf.18.d:0 "The military reinforcement of the police indeed succeeded at stopping the socialist advance, but unlike what the government had hoped, the strikers dug in and refused to surrender, despite the seemingly hopeless situation. For about ten days, this gridlock remained, when suddenly, a devious socialist plan was revealed... Too late...\n\nThe Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, an interracial native-led trade union with a very strong influence on the rural parts of South Africa, officially declared their support for the strikers and native rioters rose everywhere, confiscating guns from the white farmers they worked for leveraging their large number and overrunning arms depots of the UDF. These impromptu rebels then hit the cordon sanitaire set up by the Union Defence Force around Johannesburg, the Rand and the rebel parts of Cape Town and Durban, leaving them trapped between the strikers and the rebels. In a disorganized frenzy, a large part of the government force was forced to surrender, or defected to the rebel forces as the odds of a socialist takeover being completed materialized further by the hour."
saf.18.a:0 "This is bad!"
saf.19.t:0 "The March on Pretoria"
saf.19.d:0 "With the besieged cities relieved from the capitalist attempts at suppression, a joint socialist force marched on Pretoria, while socialist militias skirmished with UDF remnants elsewhere in South Africa. The city of Pretoria was occupied without any further violence, and it seemed the corrupt government functionaries of the old capitalist regime, both Nationalists and those following Smuts, had dispersed, fleeing northwest towards Südwestafrika, likely going to Walvis Bay, through Bechuanaland which the ICU and ISL did not yet control.\n\nIn Pretoria, a provisional socialist government was proclaimed. A bright new, socialist, era for South Africa would dawn while the capitalist pigdogs run for their lives."
saf.19.a:0 "Workers of South Africa, unite!"
saf.20.t:0 "The Strike Expands"
saf.20.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, word about our less-than-worker-friendly response to Black Monday has quickly spread to socialist circles. Now less radical unions, aligned with the Labour Party and, in one case, National, have joined the syndicalists in their general strike, putting the country on lockdown. In Pretoria, some within the cabinet are suggesting pulling the bill to placate the strikers, and to instead counter black monday with a more Keynesian approach."
saf.20.a:0 "We will not be bullied into neglecting what is needed!"
saf.20.b:0 "Perhaps a different approach would be preferable."
saf.21.t:0 "Mine Declares Bankruptcy"
saf.21.d:0 "The lowered ability to sell its metals on the market, in combination with the complete stop on production as a result of the strike, has become too much for one of our largest metal mines in the Witwatersrand. Unable to pay off its creditors, the owners have been forced to declare bankruptcy and the company is already being liquidated as we speak to try and pay back as much as is being owed. Hundreds of jobs are lost in one go, increasing the pressure on the government to give in to the striker's demands."
saf.21.a:0 "Their reserves must run out any minute now!"
saf.21.b:0 "We must give in now to limit the damage!"
saf.22.t:0 "Strikers Back Down!"
saf.22.d:0 "After two months of strike, it has been the strikers who blinked first. While they are certainly still dissatisfied with our choice to repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act, the simple reality is that the reserves of the trade unions have run out and thus the strikers can't sustain themselves with striking anymore. We have won... For now..."
saf.22.a:0 "If you don't blink, strikers are powerless!"
saf.23.t:0 "South Africa Seeks Investment"
saf.23.d:0 "Of all Britain's dominions, the Union of South Africa has maintained the closest relations with Germany and following the dawn of the great depression in 1925, the Afrikaner Nationalist government of South Africa has closed several extensive trade deals with Germany in an attempt to stifle the recession. It is no surprise then, that now, while the entente as a whole is slowly recovering from the Great Depression, South Africa is now suffers under the effects of the recession that comes forth from the British Empire.\n\nThe current loyalist Smuts government has petitioned us for investments to help rekindle their economy. While antagonizing South Africa too much is unwise as it risks us losing control over the strategically valuable Cape of Good Hope which is our link between east and west, some within our government are of the opinion that this whole situation can be completely and unreservedly be blamed on South Africa's own policies, and that we should not waste resources needed for the homecoming on helping South Africa develop."
saf.23.a:0 "I suppose we have some spare change."
saf.23.b:0 "South Africa has themselves to blame."
saf.24.t:0 "Canada Invests"
saf.24.d:0 "The Canadian and Exile governments have reacted positively towards our request for additional imperial investments to relieve the effects of Black Monday on South Africa."
saf.24.a:0 "Thank you kindly!"
saf.25.t:0 "Canada Rejects Investment"
saf.25.d:0 "The Canadian and Exile governments have rejected our request for additional imperial investments to relieve the effects of Black Monday. According to them, we only have ourselves to blame for the economic hardship, by having taken the poisoned chalice of trading with the Germans, the fact that these treaties were signed by the pact government rather than our own notwithstanding, and that they need their full resources for the homecoming."
saf.25.a:0 "How does Canada expect me to keep South Africa in the entente if they treat us like this?!"
saf.26.t:0 "The Chief Justice of the HCT"
saf.26.d:0 "Up to this point, the law has been maintained in a decentralised fashion, divided between the High Commissioner, the Advisory Councils and the tribal governments. This has resulted in local differences and made it hard to crack down on the slavery issue, especially when tribal authorities were unwilling to cooperate.\n\nIn this light, a motion has been drafted in the Volksraad to establish the office of Chief Justice of the High Commissioner Territories. This South African-appointed chief justice will centralise the rule of law and aid the high commissioner in his duties."
saf.26.a:0 "A wonderful idea!"
saf.27.t:0 "South Africa Seeks to Reform the High Commissioner System"
saf.27.d:0 "The South African government has revealed their hope to reform the High Commissioner System. In the light of the fact they have been garrisoning the territories since the British revolution they argue it would be more efficient if the High Commissioner for Southern Africa would be appointed by the South African Parliament henceforth, and that the High Commissioner Territories of Basutoland, Swaziland and Bechuanaland would be regarded as part of South Africa instead of as British colonies under temporary South African mandate from now on."
saf.27.a:0 "This would indeed be more efficient."

According to this act, the small black elite that can vote under Cape Qualified Franchise will be removed from the common voter roll and moved to a separate voter roll, voting for a Native Representation Council made up of white representatives.

His liberal lieutenant Hofmeyr, who has resigned his minister post in protest, as well as Natal conservatives such as colonel Stallard disagree with this, the former because it is an apparently unrightful restriction, and the latter because the prospect of increased native lands is too liberal for their taste."

The Asiatic Land Tenure act makes it impossible for 'Asiatics' - that is to say Natal and Transvaal Indians as well as Cape Malays - to own land outside specially designated areas.\n\nAs a gesture to liberals within the party, the act also grants Indians in Natal and Transvaal the right to elect whites to parliament on a separate roll and Natal Indians to represent themselves in the Natal Provincial Council.

But the prime minister's main attention goes to the conservatives within our own party. They will likely not approve of the bill, but it has been made clear to them that they should not expect to remain members of the [getSAPorUnited] if they have the gall to vote against. Their faces seem to reveal little about their choice.\n\nIf this revolutionary piece of legislation passes and the vote is subsequently granted to the 'Coloured' population, this draft will undoubtedly become the most influential law in South African history next to the South Africa Act itself and we can be sure that the era of Afrikaner Nationalism in South African politics will almost certainly be closed. But if we have misjudged the situation and the conservatives in the [getSAPorUnited] defect causing the bill to strand, the ensuing split in our party and Nationalist 'Swart Gevaar' tactics will likely be fatal and South Africa will be taken down a dark path.\n\nFor better or for worse, the bill has been submitted.

They joined the Afrikaner Nationalist opposition in voting against this act which would 'disturb the rightful place of the white South African in the South African hierarchy and damage South African democracy by allowing poor coloureds whose votes can easily be bought by the highest bidder to vote'.\n\nFollowing the crucial vote, our former fellow party member J.G.N. Strauss, one of the MPs who voted against the legislation, announced the creation of the National Conservative Party, which would take up 'the mantle the [getSAPorUnited] was elected with and which they so carelessly threw off'. After that prime minister Smuts received the floor. He admitted that his gamble had failed but he was adamant that 'years from now, people will look back on this moment, and think, what could have been!'. He finished his speech by declaring that he would not be waiting out a motion of no confidence by the Nationalists and the new National Conservatives and that he would ask the Governor-General to dissolve parliament this same evening to let the people decide on the issue.

These facts show that there is in fact a majority to be had for the reform and that the gamble has succeeded.\n\nThe Afrikaner Nationalist opposition is not amused at all, and one might not expect them to be, given this bill will likely render them completely unelectable in most of the Cape Province, including heartlands such as Dr D.F. Malan's constituency of Piketberg, but these grumblings will not matter. With the full support of our own party we have the needed majority in the Volksraad and they can do nothing to stop the bill from entering into force. In a speech that will likely become legendary, Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, who drafted the bill, thanked the Volksraad for their support and expressed hope that this bill will from here on out swiftly pass parliament, and eventually serve as the stepping stone towards a truly inclusive powersharing arrangement with representation for South Africa's other racial groups as well.

In the other provinces, 'coloured' people will also be allowed to vote on equal terms with whites, but because their numbers are quite limited except in western Orange Free State, their newfound influence will likely be much smaller.\n\nThe influence of this change is expected to be profound: in over half of the Cape Province, including previous Nationalist heartlands, the new voting demographic will render Afrikaner nationalist victories virtually impossible, while in urban areas their often relatively smaller amount can decide races in competitive constituencies as well, as they are widely expected to vote for the [getSAPorUnited].\n\nThis act will go down in history with the person who drafted it, Jan Smuts' liberal lieutenant Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr."

The State President appoints the cabinet - now to be called the president's council - and can be removed by parliament for misconduct or incapacity following investigation by a joint committee. If the office were to become vacant (for instance because of removal), the president of the senate would become acting state president. This year's parliament would remain the parliament of the new republic. The entrenched sections of the South Africa Act were left unamended to ensure a simple majority would suffice to pass the act.\n\nThe passing of the bill was swiftly followed by the election of Dr. D.F.

The white settler population was not consulted in this decision, despite having clearly rejected the prospect of union in the elections for the advisory council in 1919. Since the integration, the Southern Rhodesians had been continuously electing secessionist majorities in their provincial council, but unwilling to leave the British Empire as a whole, they were deterred from actually following through in their rhetoric of leaving the union.\n\nNow that South Africa has abandoned the empire, the provincial authorities in Salisbury have swiftly affirmed their allegiance to the king-emperor and declared their independence from the illegitimate republic."

Secondly, there are the dominionists, who voted in favour of the secession and claim they would henceforth only ever accept reintegration under circumstances of an authoritarian government ensuring British South African supremacy of the Afrikaners. What's left is the SAP councillors who voted against secession.\n\nThe Dominionist Party and the UFP swiftly formed the independence coalition and declared the secession of Natal from the Union with the majority, following in the footsteps of Southern Rhodesia.

And given the provinces will be rejoining the British Empire, it must be considered that they could form a security threat to South Africa if some day the homecoming is completed and Britain decides it wants to recover its empire.\n\nWith these concerns in mind, restoring order in the provinces of Natal and Southern Rhodesia seems inevitable."

Once these changes have been put into effect, we can start 'buying' up Bechuanaland land. Some pressure might need to be applied on this matter.

Now the South African government has, disturbingly, opened the Bechuanaland territory for colonisation by white South Africans. Even if we brush aside the fact that this is likely a blatant attempt to permanently bind Bechuanaland to their union, which would result in us finding the full integration of Bechuanaland as a fait accompli once the homecoming has been completed, this constitutes a gross violation of the treaties we signed with the Tswana people native to Bechuanaland."

According to them the admission of white settlers and the forcible transfer of tribal lands is a breach of the agreement that was the basis of the transfer of the territories to our control in the first place."

saf.68.a:0 "That Dutch scum!"
saf.69.t:0 "Mending the Afrikaner Schism?"
saf.69.d:0 "When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 two strains of Afrikaner politics emerged: on the one side there were Transvaal Afrikaners who favoured reconciliation and cooperation with Britain in the acquired dominion form, led by generals Louis Botha and Jan Smuts who were formerly in service of the South African Republic during the second Boer war, and on the other side one there was the Free State Afrikaners led by (Free State) president Marthinus Steyn and general James Hertzog, who had been in service of the Orange Free State during the second Boer War, favouring a more confrontational policy with the empire. Both started out in one single Afrikaner South African Party, but the ideological differences between the two sides soon came to light and caused a split in the South African Party, with the former remaining in the original party and the latter forming their own 'National Party' in opposition to the former. Since then, Afrikanerdom seemed irreversibly split along ideological lines.\n\nThis remained so until the formation of the National-SAP coalition last year. This cooperation has been quite fruitful and both sides have to accept the prospect that their two-party dominance is increasingly challenged by other parties and independents dissatisfied with the status-quo, especially after the economic woes during the last two decades. Deputy prime minister Smuts has now engineered a plan to, for the first time since the very first general election of 1910 unite the South African and Nationalist Parties into a single list for the elections of 1938, the so-called United Party."
saf.69.a:0 "A wonderful idea!"

saf.70.t:0 "The Fusion Remnants"
saf.70.d:0 "The news of the reunion between the South African Party and the United Party has shook South African politics to its core. With the two largest parties merging into one, United dominance of South African politics seems unavoidable, at least for the next term. However, some question how long this fusion will actually hold, given the fact that the ideological differences in terms of race relations and South Africa's connection to the Empire between the former South African Party and the former National Party have been pushed to the background rather than disappeared.\n\nA certain segment of the National electorate wants nothing to do with it in any case: Nationalists in the Cape province, headed by the former editor of the 'Die Burger' newspaper, Dr. Daniel François Malan, have rejected fusion and announced their own continuation of the National Party, the so-called 'Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party' or 'Purified National Party'.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, English-speaking reactionaries within the South African Party lead by colonel C.F. Stallard also rejected fusion, citing their distrust of prime minister J.B.M. Hertzog and the Afrikaner Nationalist faction he carries into the newfound United Party."

That is to say, white South Africans go to the polls, although in the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia, they are joined by members of the non-white elite, provided they adhere to certain property qualifications.\n\nAs usual, the race is between the National Party and the South African Party, but the removal of general J.B.M. Hertzog from the leadership of the National Party is a severe upset. Under the newfound leadership of the more radical dr. Daniel François Malan, National has pledged that if they are served with a majority, they will abolish the monarchy and declare a republic at the shortest possible notice, hoping that this unambiguous stance will help them defeat the South African Party. South Africa holds its breath."

Colonel Frederic Creswell refused to support his fellow party member and in protest Madeley and his supporters left the cabinet and went into the opposition. Ever since, Madeley has been disputing Labour leadership with Creswell.\n\nAs a by-result of the much larger merger between the SAP and the National Party, this split has been healed as well: after prolonged alignment with the National Party in the Volksraad, Labour MPs from the Creswell wing have elected to join the newfound United Party as well, thus relinquishing their claim to being the Labour Party.\n\nIn this capacity, the National Council wing of the Labour Party remains now as the sole faction in the Labour Party, and thus the leadership of the party remains no longer in doubt. It is now securely in the hands of Walter Madeley."

That is to say, white South Africans go to the polls, although in the Cape Province and Southern Rhodesia, they are joined by members of the non-white elite, provided they adhere to certain property qualifications.\n\nThese elections are very much unusual: generals Smuts and Hertzog, who had already been ruling in coalition with one another for a while, have decided to merge their party into a single parliamentary group, meaning National and SAP MP candidates will not contest one another. As such, despite limited resistance from a newly reunited Labour and the Purified National Party, the outcome of this election seems to be set in stone already."

Malan's Purified National Party.\n\nWhile the United Party has secured their rule for the coming term of the next five years, at least assuming the fusion holds, it is clear that Malan's Purifieds are starting to build momentum. Because of this, next election might not be so easily fought."

saf.76.t:0 "Preparations for the Great Trek Centenary"
saf.76.d:0 "Next year the Great Trek will have commenced exactly a century ago: in 1838, Dutch-speaking settlers from the Cape Colony started 'trekking' - migrating - eastwards to escape the influence of the British colonial administration which at the time stretched roughly from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth, which eventually directly led first to the creation of the Boer Republic of Natalia in what is now the province of Natal and after its demise to that of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (Transvaal).\n\nTo celebrate this occasion, the Great Trek Centenary Committee has been formed. They are planning to organise a reenactment of the Great Trek with authentic ox-wagons who will move from town to town, starting in Cape Town in August next year, to eventually arrive in Pretoria at a designated location at Dingaan's Day, where the foundation of a grand Voortrekker monument is to be laid. Of course, the committee is expecting significant state support for this remembrance project of Afrikaner history."

While this fundraising was quite successful, the amount hardly compares to the state funding that was expected by the committee, but at least the festivities need not be cancelled.\n\nIt is clear however that many Afrikaners resent the fact that the government refused to properly fund this ode to their history."

saf.78.d:0 "The Ossewabrandwag is a militant Afrikaner cultural organisation established in commemoration of the centennial anniversary of the Great Trek by former Johannes van Rensburg, the former administrator of the Orange Free State. The meaning of the name is 'Ox-Wagon Sentinel', referring to the ox-wagons of the Trek, and the movement has based itself on authoritarian nationalist movements in Europe like the League for National Recovery in the Netherlands and the DVLP in Germany.\n\nEspecially concerning is their paramilitary wing, the 'Stormjaers' (Stormtroopers) who are not afraid of confrontation or violence, especially against non-whites and jews."
saf.78.a:0 "Concerning!"
saf.79.t:0 "The Start of the Great Trek"
saf.79.d:0 "The centenary celebration of the Great Trek, when the ancestors of South Africa's Boers moved into the interior of South Africa to escape British influence, has been kicked off at the foot of the statue of Jan van Riebeeck - the Dutch explorer viewed by many Afrikaners as the founding father of their nation - in Cape Town. The first ox-wagons have already departed under the watchful eye of a large crowd, estimated to be made up of over one hundred thousand people - astounding given that Cape Town is considered to be an English city. The chairman of the Great Trek Centenary Committee, National politician H.J. Klopper, owns the first two wagons of the parade, and invited all of Afrikanerdom to partake in the festivities. The ox-wagon parade will follow the so-called 'Pad van Suid-Afrika' to Pretoria, while a smaller contingent will split off at Vegkop and instead journey to the location where the battle of Blood River took place in Natal. Over the next few months, the ox-wagons of the re-enactment will be passing through numerous small towns and larger cities where Afrikaners in classic voortrekker clothing, while the 'dominee', the town priest, will be welcoming them with extensive festivities."
saf.79.a:0 "There they go, good luck!"
saf.80.t:0 "The Centenary Celebration Reaches Port Elizabeth"
saf.80.d:0 "The ox-wagons of the Centenary celebration have arrived in Port Elizabeth, after having passed to medium-size towns like Stellenbosch, Paarl, Worcester and Swellendam and a myriad of small towns and villages. In all these settlements, the festivities have been a resounding success, bringing out a wave of intense Afrikaner patriotism. However, the city of Port Elizabeth is primarily inhabited by English-speakers who are quite hostile to this celebration of Afrikaner culture, and for this reason, as well as the unfriendly attitude towards Afrikaners espoused by its mayor, Klopper has decided against seeking the confrontation by holding a parade through the city, with the parade instead directly moving on towards the small town of Willowmore and after that to towards Graaff-Reinet and the site of the Slagter's Nek rebellion in 1816 which is regarded as one of the reasons behind the original Great Trek."
saf.80.a:0 "An unfortunate dent in race relations."
saf.81.t:0 "The Centenary Celebration Reaches Bulhoek"
saf.81.d:0 "Now the re-enactment of the Centenary celebration has arrived in Bulhoek, near the border of the Orange Free State, after having visited Graaff-Reinet and having paid respect to the executed Afrikaner rebels at the site of Slagter's Nek as well as more smaller villages and towns. At Slagter's Nek the festivities were especially massive and in every town where the parade arrives the song 'Die Stem van Suid-Afrika' is sung by the crowd. Despite its limited size as a farm near Steynsburg, Bulhoek is significant because it is the birthplace of Paul Kruger, the famous president of the South African Republic (Transvaal) who eventually died in exile during the Second Boer War. Here too large amounts of people welcomed the parade, if not as many as in Slagter's Nek. Tomorrow the parade will pass into Steynsburg proper and within a few days the ox-wagons are expected to cross into the Orange Free State, leaving the Cape Province behind."

saf.82.d:0 "After successfully crossing the Orange River - leaving behind the Cape Province and entering the Orange Free State - the ox-wagon parade has arrived in the city of Bloemfontein, which, as the seat of the judiciary, is the second capital of South Africa they visit after starting in the legislative capital of Cape Town. Once the parade will arrive in Pretoria, our seat of government, the re-enactment will have visited them all.\n\nIn previous cities the parade visited, many street names were renamed in honour of Afrikaner heroes, but English-speaking town council of Bloemfontein has refused to follow suit. In response Klopper has refused to use the new oxen provided by the city and made a statement by pulling the wagons through the city by hand. At the same time, torches were revealed by young participants of the Trek, which had apparently been kept alight since the parade left Cape Town.\n\nThe rest of the month will be dedicated to the trek to site of the battle of Vegkop, near the town of Heilbron."

At present, many of the participants, both of those driving or following ox-wagons, and those partaking in the local festivities, have allowed their beards to grow so as to look more like their ancestors 100 years ago.\n\nFrom here, a small contingent of the ox-wagon parade will be splitting off. They will travel south from here into the province of Natal, to be present at the site of the battle of Blood River, which will be exactly a century ago coming Dingane's Day, visiting cities like Ladysmith, Pietermaritzburg and Durban on the way. The remainder of the parade will continue to follow 'die Pad' into the province of Transvaal, to be present at the laying of the foundation of the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria at Dingane's Day."

saf.84.d:0 "Since Heilbron the remainder of the re-enactment parade has somewhat diverted from 'die Pad van Suid-Afrika' and instead visited first a large amount of smaller settlements, with the northernmost one being the province of Zeerust. From there, the parade adjusted back south, moving through mining towns like Benoni and Roodepoort to eventually arrive the industrial city of Johannesburg. Despite the fact that Johannesburg too, is an English city, the crowd is large, although it will likely dwarfed by the receiving crowd in Pretoria three days from now.\n\nAs the parade leaves the city, it is reinforced with additional ox-wagons of local Afrikaners, some of whom are flying the 'Vierkleur': the flag of the defeated South African Republic."

saf.85.d:0 "The re-enactment parade has travelled throughout South Africa, and has now finally arrived at Pretoria, and more specifically Monumentkoppie - Monument Rock - where the foundation of a grand Voortrekker Monument is to be laid. The scale of the crowd that was waiting for the Trekkers can be described as nothing less than astounding: estimations are ranging from one hundred thousand to two hundred and fifty thousand Afrikaners, which could amount to a third of all Afrikaners in the country including cabinet ministers and even general Jan Smuts, although he declined to give a speech. The festivities are still officially apolitical, but the crowd was singing 'Die Stem' and calling for a republic.\n\nWhen the Ossewa's finally arrive, a giant bonfire was lit with the torches that have been kept alight from Cape Town and three Afrikaner women, descendants of the Voortrekker leaders, placed the first cornerstone of the monument. Then, the wagons are - without their oxen - carried upon the hill. Once firmly put in place, heroic scenes of the original Great Trek were re-enacted; the descendant of a British settler who gave one of the first voortrekkers a bible was shouted down for reciting the English greeting of his ancestor in this play. In the evening, the festivities were closed off with the traditional South African Braai.\n\nAt the same time, the smaller delegation that split off at Vegkop arrived at Blood River, where they were welcomed by Dr. D.F. Malan who delivered the main address, electrifying the crowd by comparing the old trek with the current process of urbanisation and calling for the establishment of an Afrikaner republic."

Both pointed at the draft of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, which would pass parliament tomorrow under Malan's guidance.

While neither has much love for syndicalism, Hertzog believes that no South Africans should die in what is strictly an European conflict, and that unreservedly joining the side of the British would hurt Afrikaner-British relations here in South Africa. Instead he propagates armed neutrality, remaining out of the war unless our interests are directly threatened.\n\nSmuts on the other hand, wants South Africa to partake in the homecoming directly, arguing that South Africa has this moral obligation towards the British Empire, as its dominion and to make up for the protection the country is afforded within its framework. No compromise can seemingly be found and the fusion government is shaking to its foundation. To resolve the issue, the cabinet has taken to a vote among the ministers."

When asked about syndicalism by an MP, Hertzog responded that the syndicalist revolution was far away, focused on Europe and does not pose a credible threat to South Africa, isolated as it is behind a continent worth of unindustrialised nations.\n\nJan Smuts rose to his feet to challenge this claim: the syndicalists of the Internationale were out for world domination he exclaimed, and have to be stopped. He points out that South Africa, as a nation with only a small population spread over a large  territory, is poor in defence, but rich in resources, and that distancing ourselves from our allies would leave us vulnerable to an attack.\n\nHertzog's motion for neutrality was put to the vote..."

It also formed a number of other unions amongst people of colour. While the leaders of the organisation itself are mainly drawn from the radical wing of the white working class, the Industrial Workers of Africa founded with their help would merge into the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, which has a substantial black African, 'Coloured' and Indian membership. While the South African Labour Party has remained apart from the ISL due to its more progressive stance on race relations more radical members push for a reconciliation. In the meanwhile, the ISL and it's affiliates in the ICU campaign for political reform in South Africa and organise resistance to the worst excesses Von Göring commits against the native population in Mittelafrika."

saf.101.d:0 "The International Socialist League has completely condemned our governments racial policies and have united with other native rights groups to oppose us. We have responded by producing the Suppression of Syndicalism Act, banning any party subscribing to Syndicalism. The act defines Syndicalism and its aims so sweepingly that anyone who opposes government policy risks being labelled as a Syndicalist. Since the law specifically states that Syndicalism aims to disrupt racial harmony, it can be frequently used to gag opposition to apartheid. Disorderly gatherings are banned, as are certain organisations that were deemed threatening to the government, such as the ICU and the smaller ANC."

saf.102.t:0 "The Population Registration Act"
saf.102.d:0 "The Nationalist government's ideology believes South Africa does not comprise a single nation, but is made up of four distinct racial groups: white, black, 'coloured' and Asian. These groups are further split into 13 nations or racial federations. White people encompassed the English and Afrikaans language groups; the black populace was divided into ten such groups. The Population Registration Act, requires that every South African be classified into one of these racial 'population groups'. This act provides the foundation upon which the whole edifice of apartheid shall be constructed."
saf.102.a:0 "Let me see your papers..."
saf.103.t:0 "Petty Apartheid"
saf.103.d:0 "Following the Population Registration Act, a series of laws came into force, collectively refereed to as 'petty' Apartheid, as opposed to the 'greater' Apartheid planned by the Nationalist government. The first of these was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, prohibiting marriage between whites and people of other races. The Immorality Amendment Act forbade 'unlawful racial intercourse' and 'any immoral or indecent act' between a white and a black, Indian or 'coloured' person. Transport and civil facilities were segregated. Education was strictly segregated, with universities established for the sole use of Xhosa, Zulu, Sotho, 'Coloured', Indians etc. The cumulative effect of this was to stratify society solidly along racial lines."
saf.103.a:0 "So be it."
saf.104.t:0 "The Group Areas Act"
saf.104.d:0 "The second stage of grand apartheid was the Group Areas Act. Until then, despite existing segregation law, most settlements had people of different races living side by side. This Act put an end to diverse areas and determined where one lived according to race. Each race was allotted its own area, which could be used as a basis for force eviction, allowing the government to demolish black shanty town slums and forced white employers to pay for the construction of housing for those black workers who were permitted to reside in cities otherwise reserved for whites."
saf.104.a:0 "Off the reservation."
saf.105.t:0 "The Native Trust and Homeland Act"
saf.105.d:0 "Territorial separation was hardly a new institution in South Africa. There were, for example, the 'reserves' created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, the percentage of land reserved was increased from 8 to 13 percent to be used for black homelands, still a relatively small amount compared with the total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. These homelands or 'Bantustans' divided South Africa into a number of separate states, each of which is supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for the different ethnic groups. The practical effect of this legislation was to remove the citizenship of natives living within South Africa and reduce their status to that of migrant labour. The Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act abolished the remaining parliamentary representation for black people under the Representation of Natives Act, now represented by their own 'national' authorities."
saf.105.a:0 "Interesting."
saf.106.t:0 "Race in South Africa"
saf.106.d:0 "South Africa's population is perhaps the most diverse in all of Africa, but racism and segregation are institutionalized and omnipresent.\n\nThe white European population forms the top of South Africa's racial hierarchy; they hold socio-economic power in the nation and enforce a degree of segregation throughout South Africa. The group is divided between the Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch colonists who arrived in the Cape during Dutch rule, who hold political power owing to being the majority of the almost exclusively white electorate, and the British South Africans, English-speaking descendants of colonists who arrived in the 19th century, who hold most economic power, although this is shifting somewhat to the Afrikaner advantage in recent years.\n\nOf the non-white population, the so-called 'Coloured' community enjoys the most respect. This group is made up of people of mixed heritage and most of them speak Afrikaans, the same language as white Afrikaners. They make up the majority of population in the western Cape Province, and make up the largest part of the non-white property-based voters in that same province as well as in Southern Rhodesia.\n\nThen there is the Asiatic group: South Africans of Asian descent. The majority in this group are former indentured workers from British India or their descendants, who live primarily in Natal and to a smaller extent in Transvaal. In the Cape one can also find the Cape Malays, who were brought here from Maritime Southeast Asia by the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe least respected are the original (native) black Africans. Most of them belong to one of several Bantu peoples, the Xhosa, the Zulu, the Sotho or one of several smaller tribal groups. Despite making up the majority of the South African population by far, they have very little political power, even in the provinces where non-whites can theoretically vote, where very few of them fulfill the needed property requirements. With an entrenched white electorate, hopes for reform are dim."

With its influence, the union also played a crucial role in the success of the South African revolution.\n\nIn 1924, the South African government had deported Kadalie, who left for London just in time to play a role in the revolution there. Ever since, Kadalie has acted as the representative of the South African syndicalist movement in London and Paris. Now that the bourgeoise government of South Africa has been torn down, the influential politician has returned to South Africa to mark his presence in post-revolutionary politics. When his ship arrived in Cape Town he received a hero's welcome by a crowd waiting for him."

saf.108.d:0 "The Johannesburg convention has opened. South Africa's old government is no more and delegates from across the country of all ethnicities have gathered in Johannesburg to establish a constitution to base a newly crafted government on. Drafts are based on the systems of government of Britain and France, but it seems clear that there will be factionalism. On the one hand, there is David Ivon Jones and his ISL, who, while openly calling for an eventual powersharing arrangement, argue that whites will first need to guide the socialist state until the popular majority is sufficiently educated and politically aware to be able to properly participate in communal politics. On the other hand are the ICU, who have elected to be led by the newly arrived Clements Kadalie. They want to immediately implement a system of ethnic federalism, giving a degree of autonomy to each ethnic group under a unified multiracial state.\n\nAs a compromise between the whites who fear swamping by the larger amount of natives, the decisions will be made by a half on half split group of representatives of both organisations."
saf.108.a:0 "Let the debates begin!"
saf.109.t:0 "The Legislative Branch"
saf.109.d:0 "The first clash between the ISL and ICU materialises on the topic of the legislative branch. While both sides agree that the new legislative institution should be bicameral and that the 'lower house' should be a confederation of trade unions, which they have agreed will go by the name of the 'South African Confederation of Trade Unions' (SACTU), it is the upper house that is cause for consternation.\n\nThe ISL seeks to establish the so-called 'Advisory Commission', an organ elected by white South Africans which serves to check the legislation approved by the SACTU, which can block legislation or amend it with the approval of the government. The ICU on the other hand wants the upper house to be an Ethnic Representation Council, with each ethnicity receiving two delegates, who can with a majority send legislation back to the SACTU, who would then be obliged to amend or repeal it before sending it back to the ERC."
saf.109.a:0 "A white check is necessary."
saf.109.b:0 "Each ethnicity needs representation."
saf.110.t:0 "The Judicial Branch"
saf.110.d:0 "Another clash has started over the judicial branch: the ISL wants a single and colourblind judicial system for all South Africans, regardless of the circumstances of the crime, but no right to object to who judges you based on the colour of their skin. In effect, because almost exclusively whites have been educated in the law, this means the old judicial system will likely be mostly preserved, and as the system creates no pressure to educate new non-white lawyers, justice will be carried out almost exclusively by whites for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis reality has been noticed by the ICU, who instead want it constitutionally entrenched that each racial group in the federation will have the right to be judged by their own ethnicity if they so desire in a case against the government, and a judge not held to the ethnicity of either side in a civil case."
saf.110.a:0 "We don't have the manpower at present to accomodate for that right!"
saf.110.b:0 "This right is the only way to definitively prevent racial prejudice in the justice system!"
saf.111.t:0 "The Executive Branch"
saf.111.d:0 "The final conflict is with regards to the executive branch.\n\nThe ISL wants the government to derive its legitimacy from the upper house, and to atypically make it possible for that house to recall government officials only. Under their plan, the SACTU will only have the ability to control the government through failing to approve its legislation.\n\nOf course, the ICU disagrees, and wants the point of gravity to be with the SACTU/lower house, which more properly represents the will of the people according to them as it is elected indirectly but equally by every worker in our nation."
saf.111.a:0 "The Upper House is more important!"
saf.111.b:0 "Every worker deserves equal representation."
saf.112.t:0 "The ISL Government Is Inaugurated."
saf.112.d:0 "The Johannesburg Convention has closed and a constitution has been approved. Elections have been held on the grounds of the decisions made and it was clear that the ISL managed to concentrate a large amount of power to themselves. It is of little surprise therefore, that the David Ivon Jones, leader of the provisional government, has been elected as South Africa's first chairman. He then recommended a cabinet which was swiftly also approved. Under Jones' guidance, socialism in South Africa will likely venture into a bright new future. Many white South Africans are also thoroughly relieved by the monoracial makeup of the new government."
saf.112.a:0 "Workers of the World unite!"
saf.113.t:0 "The ICU Government Is Inaugurated."
saf.113.d:0 "The Johannesburg Convention has closed and a constitution has been approved. Elections have been held on the grounds of the decisions made and it was clear that the ICU managed to break the power monopoly the ISL was intent on designating to themselves. As such, after years of exile in Britain, Clements Kadalie has been elected as the first non-provisional chairman of the new South Africa, and the first non-white head of state of the nation. Seeking to prevent racial struggles from embracing the country, he has recommended a cabinet with members of each of South Africa's ethnicities, headed by the secretary of the executive, Solomon Sachs, a white South African and friend of Kadalie. Despite this, the new mostly non-white government takes some adjusting for the white population of South Africa, and unrest in areas where they form the majority is on the rise."
saf.113.a:0 "A new South Africa dawns!"
saf.114.t:0 "The ICU Fires Clements Kadalie"
saf.114.d:0 "It has been reported that the executive committee of the Industrial and Commercial Worker's Union has fired Clements Kadalie as the chairman of the union.\n\nWhile Kadalie was toasting with the leadership of the Union of Britain after being deported, the running of the ICU was taken over by people on the ground right here in South Africa, fighting suppression by South African authorities. This already created a perception that Kadalie hijacked the voice of the ICU without having partaken in the revolution, but as the founder of the organisation, Kadalie had the needed support to pull the members along.\n\nTo a dead end, it seems now, because Kadalie had been advocating working with the ISL and their white leaders, despite the opposition from the Africanist faction in the Union led by James La Guma. Now it appears the ISL government is only marginally interested in the ICU, and has given few if any worthwhile concessions.\n\nGiven it is Kadalie who led the union here, he is the one to take the fall. Following his dismissal, the executive committee appointed Jimmy La Guma the new chairman. It is expected that La Guma will pull the ICU into a more radical direction, for he was never afraid to share his opinion that the black population of South Africa is the true proletariat."

saf.115.d:0 "The newly appointed chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Worker's Union, the Africanist James 'Jimmy' La Guma, has denounced the ISL government. According to him, our new socialist government is functionally little different from the old regime, being a vehicle to securing the position of the whites over the backs of a black proletariat.\n\nApparently we pay lip service to the idea of majority rule to appeal to Paris while we suppress black participation in practice. It is the natural outcome as the white working class is economically dependent on the work of the black working class and therefore he declares that the ICU will have to continue its struggle and work towards a native republic."

From Cape Town to Pretoria to Salisbury and Durban, militias control the streets. In Pretoria, David Ivon Jones and the rest of the cabinet have been arrested by these forces.\n\nIn the morning, South Africa was addressed by radio by La Guma, who declared himself the new Chairman of [SAF.GetNameDef]. The faux-socialist regime of the white ruling class has been overthrown, and the true, black, proletariat would finally rise to power after so many years of oppression.

It is believed time will be needed to recover from this setback."

However, to many, La Guma's indigenist government, with aggressive rhetoric to the white diaspora, is considered by many the worst possible outcome, causing a second wave of emigration possibly even more severe than the first one by a segment of white South Africans who stayed at first, depriving South Africa yet again of valuable expertise and curtailing our economic output once again."

saf.120.d:0 "With an eye to the coming elections, the National Party has decided to organise a national congress in Pretoria to determine party policy of the next few years. Members from across the nation have travelled to our government's seat.\n\nDuring the course of the congress, the leader of the National Party in the Cape Province, Dr. D.F. Malan, has been chastising the party’s nationwide leader, general James Hertzog, on many accounts, especially concerning the failure to abolish the monarchy during his term as prime minister from 1924 to 1929 and his subsequent failure to defeat Jan Smuts and his South African Party, for which the moderate and vague standpoints of Hertzog are to be blamed according to Malan. It comes as little surprise then that Malan subsequently challenged Hertzog for the party leadership of the party. The members were asked to speak out their preferences. Hertzog’s failure in the last 8 years to seize the office of prime minister back from general Smuts had sealed his fate: dr. Malan would lead the National Party in the next general election, on an aggressive republican and Afrikaner Nationalist platform, decrying that once given the mandate he will declare South Africa’s full independence as a republic now that the exiles are not in a position to act against such a measure."

As such, the day holds importance to Afrikaner nationalism as well, whose adherents view the victory that day as a sign from God that they were to shape a western country in South Africa's wilderness.\n\nThe day is generally celebrated with sports matches, especially cricket, theatre shows, church gatherings and other festivities. Unsurprisingly given the context, the nation's black African majority is less fond of the holiday, and usually pick this date to protest racial discrimination."

Some newspapers have already declared Afrikaner Nationalism a thing of the past, reduced to a large minor party which could at best secure a kingmaker position.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the Labour Party has been making gains.

By forcibly removing the native population from our urban centres, we can ensure the white population does not have to unduly compete with native workers who work at similar positions at a much lower wage.

A group of armed Zulu men have attacked the local bank and taken away into the Drakensberg mountains with what were supposed to be the wages of the miners. According to reports from eye-witnesses, the robbers claimed the continuation of the Ninevites, a historically feared gang, which has lost much of its prominence - at least outside of the prisons and as a unified entity - following their leader Nongoloza’s disavowal following encouragement of the authorities.\n\nIt is theorized that economic hardship as a result of Black Monday must have pushed these men who either were previously affiliated with the gang, or knew someone previously affiliated to it, to organise once again. Despite their best intentions, the police has been unable to track them down."

saf.149.t:0 "The Regiment of the Stone Hits Nelspruit"
saf.149.d:0 "The new iteration of the Regiment of the Stone gang has emerged from their apparent Drakensberg hideout once again, this time in Nelspruit, where they hit the local train station, a key stopover on the line between Johannesburg and the port of Laurenço Marques in Mozambique, and made off with valuables held for safekeeping there. Once again, police stood powerless to prevent an evidently well-planned escape into the bush to the south of the town.\n\nDisturbingly, it appears the gang has already grown in number since their heist in Ermelo, and similarly worryingly, the town of Barberton, where Nongoloza is incarcerated on a rape charge, is only some 20 miles away from Nelspruit. Police theorizes that it is the gang’s intention to break him out. Others disagree and point out that this would be too obvious, and that the two successful heists, in combination with smaller robberies underway, have already netted the group a substantial amount of wealth. One more successful heist would likely procure the monetary means needed for the group to disappear forever, and in modern times and resources like automobiles and airplanes, it seems implausible that a gang would remain at large for as long as the previous gangs have. Therefore they propose an attack on Barberton would be a large risk following their existing achievements, and they instead point at the town of Lydenburg as the next target. Some don’t agree with this proposal either, and expect the gang will aim to leave South Africa by entering Portuguese East Africa as soon as possible, as the route of movement from Ermelo to Nelspruit suggests. If we can correctly estimate their next move, we might be able to entrap them."

If the South African Police would not have been their to assist the prison wardens, they might well have succeeded, but instead they were entrapped. A shootout which could be clearly heard in Barberton itself ensued, until a large part of the gang was deceased and the remainder wisely decided to surrender. Law-abiding South African citizens need not fear these men anymore, nor was Nongoloza given the opportunity to escape, although there is little indication he conspired with the gang.\n\nThe gang members who surrendered have guided our officials to their hidden encampment some four miles from the prison, where we have recovered most of the stolen goods and money from the Ermelo and Nelspruit heists."

Now with Nongoloza within their ranks, the gang has disappeared into the wilderness again, but on a positive note, the Lydenburg gold transport safely arrived in the vault of the Standard Bank of South Africa in Johannesburg."

Properly reinforcing the entire region to prevent a crossing would have been impossible.\n\nBut this does not matter either way, because it appears the Ninevites never intended to cross the border. Instead they stayed in the vicinity of Nelspruit and struck Barberton Prison, where the wardens were, under pressure of the overwhelming force of the gang, left with little choice but to hand Nongoloza over, and some other people incarcerated there with affiliations to either the old gang or new gang members."

Despite the police’s best attempts, and a subsequent large scale search through Swaziland, where we suspect the gang had been hiding between the events in Barberton and now, and where they probably retreated back to, we have been unable to either find them, nor did we find back any of the riches they have stolen, aside from some South African Pounds spent in Mbabane which can be traced back to the first bank heist in Ermelo."

The exhibitions both boast our achievements in the last half-century and include representatives from most of what remains of the empire: from Canada and the Caribbean to Australasia and its pacific extensions.

Unfortunately, this brings some unintended side-effects with it: rural South Africa is not very rich in opportunity, and thus, with the possibility of moving to cities like Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban suddenly no longer severely restricted, many thousands of South Africans are now leaving their ancestral lands to seek employment in the factories and mines. Unfortunately, the local governments do not actually have the resources to handle this unprecedented influx and most of these migrants are thus forced to settle in existing townships at a scale never seen before, overpopulating them and causing extremely squalid conditions and disease in these townships as a result."

Citizenship will be beholden only to those the 'of whom it can be expected that they will act as builders up of the nation' and those are called ‘burgers’.

When in 1919 South Africa was forced to turn South West Africa back over to the Germans, the Rehoboth community was split between those who would inevitably be seen as pro-South African collaborators and sympathisants (especially Sam Khubis veterans) who were forced into exile in South Africa, and those remaining in Rehoboth, with their historic autonomy revoked.\n\nNow that Bechuanaland has been opened to white settlement, their ‘Kaptein’ (equivalent of chief) Albert Mouton has petitioned the prime minister for the establishment of a ‘Nuwe Roheboth’ in Bechuanaland, relatively close to their old settlement across the border, which would be expected to attract the scattered exiles.

This is will be the first opportunity for the newly enfranchised Coloured South Africans to show their power, as they make up the majority in this constituency which has been under Nationalist control since 1921. The National Party has nominated its candidate, as did the [getUnitedorSAP]. We already know that in 1943 this constituency will be scrapped, but the outcome will likely clarify on a small scale what stands to happen in the general elections."

saf.92.t:0 "The Death of Jan Smuts"
saf.92.d.notfederation:0 "Jan Smuts passed away at family farm of Doornkloof, Irene, near Pretoria, today. A giant of South African politics, General Smuts has played a decisive role in the nation's history for the last half century. Originally a commander of a Boer Kommando in the 2nd Boer War, Smuts would go on to reconcile his Afrikaner heritage and forge a loyalty to the British Empire that never wavered through the subsequent years. Fighting in the Welkrieg against the German general, Paul von Lettow Vorbeck, Smuts returned home to South Africa, becoming Prime Minister for a time. His position as leader of the Dominion Party has been filled by Herbert J. Stanley."

He could not prevent the country moving away from the Empire, but, largely through his efforts and those of his protoge Jan Hofmeyer, South Africa was restored to its place within the British Commonwealth. His friendship with Hofmeyer had survived the parting of the Dominionist Party, now though, competition between the Conservatives and Progressives is sure to become fiercer."

### Focus Tree ###

SCA_Nordic_Constitution:0 "The Nordic Constitution"
SCA_Nordic_Constitution_desc:0 "With the creation of a unified Nordic state, it is paramount that a constitution shall be adopted that counts for all the member states of the federation, emphasizing the strength of the federal government."
SCA_Nordic_Parliament:0 "A Designated Nordic Parliament"
SCA_Nordic_Parliament_desc:0 "We should establish a designated Nordic parliament elected through proportional voting in the entire federation, thereby ensuring every Nordic citizen will have equal representation in the federal government in Gothenburg."
SCA_Joint_Sessions_as_Legislative:0 "Use the Joint Sessions"
SCA_Joint_Sessions_as_Legislative_desc:0 "The joint sessions have proved a great success earlier, emphasizing the existence and close cooperation of the Nordic countries. These joint sessions will function as the proper legislative branch of the Nordic government."
SCA_Council_of_Kings:0 "A Council of Kings"
SCA_Council_of_Kings_desc:0 "The monarchs of our member states ought to fulfil their role together on the federal level, establishing a council filled with monarchs who shall appoint the federal government."
SCA_Every_King_a_Turn:0 "Every King a Turn"
SCA_Every_King_a_Turn_desc:0 "A council as head of state is bound to result in bureaucratic problems and disagreements. Instead each monarch should rule for two years, and then revolve power to the monarch of the next country."
SCA_Judicial_Autonomy:0 "Judicial Autonomy"
SCA_Judicial_Autonomy_desc:0 "Each member state should retain its own judicial branch and these judicial branches should retain their full autonomy. If a Dane were to judge a Swedish case this would be bound to create nationalist friction."
SCA_Nordic_High_Council:0 "A Nordic High Council"
SCA_Nordic_High_Council_desc:0 "While the local judiciaries ought to remain in place, the highest court of each country shall be replaced by a single Nordic High Council of Judges, which shall have the last word in the most controversial of cases."
SCA_Federal_Judiciary:0 "Federal Judiciary"
SCA_Federal_Judiciary_desc:0 "We should merge the judicial branches of all member states into a single federal judiciary. This will promote equal lawgiving in the entire federation and thereby promote ever closer federation."
SCA_Ratify_the_Constitution:0 "Ratify the Constitution"
SCA_Ratify_the_Constitution_desc:0 "With all of the most important questions out of the way, it is time to let representatives of the federal member states ratify the federal constitution, making our federation a little more real."
SCA_The_First_Nordic_Elections:0 "The First Nordic Elections"
SCA_The_First_Nordic_Elections_desc:0 "With the constitution properly established, it is time for NTC, mostly made up of civil servants, to transfer power to an elected federal government. To this end, the first pan-Nordic elections will have to be organised."
SCA_Socialdemocratic_Triumph:0 "Social Democratic Majority"
SCA_Socialdemocratic_Triumph_desc:0 "The NSAP successfully secured its place, and came victorious out of the Nordic elections. With them, a unified Nordic welfare state is looming, one that will be a shining example for the rest of the world to follow."
SCA_Safety_Net:0 "Establish a Safety Net"
SCA_Safety_Net_desc:0 "We should establish a safety net for those unfortunate enough to be unable to work. It is not fitting for a civilised nation such as ours to allow the people to starve to death, rather than to help them."
SCA_Aid_the_Nordic_Worker:0 "Aid the Nordic Worker"
SCA_Aid_the_Nordic_Worker_desc:0 "The federation has gained its hard-earned prosperity off the back of the Nordic working class. It is only fair to help them, doing something back for the great achievements they secured."
SCA_Secure_Social_Rights_Federally:0 "Establish Fundamental Social Rights"
SCA_Secure_Social_Rights_Federally_desc:0 "Several fundamental social rights hold significance. We should ensure that the Nordic government shall be bound to fulfil the social rights the Nordic people, and arguably the people of the rest of the world as well, deserve."
SCA_Invest_in_Education:0 "Invest in Education"
SCA_Invest_in_Education_desc:0 "Educating the young is an investment into the future. By ensuring our educational system is qualitatively superior, we can raise more people into higher paying jobs and thus increase our prosperity to an even greater extend."
SCA_Invest_in_Healthcare:0 "Improve our Healthcare"
SCA_Invest_in_Healthcare_desc:0 "Good healthcare is vital: without it, people may well die unnecessary deaths. We should ensure that healthcare is qualitatively good and affordable to common man of our federation!"
SCA_The_Nordic_Model:0 "The Nordic Model"
SCA_The_Nordic_Model_desc:0 "As a result of our efforts, the Nordic welfare state has developed into a shining example for the world. A democratic utopia that cares for its citizens without the need of resorting to tyranny or violence."
SCA_Victory_for_Liberalism:0 "Liberal Coalition"
SCA_Victory_for_Liberalism_desc:0 "The liberals have surged throughout Scandinavia and secured themselves the majority needed to form the federal government. Their influence in these early days of the federation will certainly be felt."
SCA_Safeguard_National_Autonomy:0 "Safeguard National Autonomy"
SCA_Safeguard_National_Autonomy_desc:0 "We should ensure that we don't fall for the temptation of unnecessary centralisation. Such actions would only harm the popularity of the federation and keep it from improving the lives of its citizens. Local autonomy is therefore paramount."
SCA_Support_Nordic_Business:0 "Nordic Business"
SCA_Support_Nordic_Business_desc:0 "The countries of the north have a healthy private branch. We should encourage this entrepreneurship for the good of the member states and the federation as a whole."
SCA_The_Nordic_Standard:0 "The Nordic Standard"
SCA_The_Nordic_Standard_desc:0 "Our sound and down-to-earth approach has allowed to us to set a standard for other countries to try and emulate. A standard in controlling the government, if you will."
SCA_Conservatism_Reigns:0 "Conservative-Agrarian Coalition"

SCA_Expand_Federal_Infrastructure:0 "Expand the Federal Infrastructure"
SCA_Expand_Federal_Infrastructure_desc:0 "Scandinavia is stretched land with few people. We should invest in the infrastructure to connect the Swedes to the Norwegians and the Danes to the Swedes. This will be paramount in creating a true Nordic identity."

SCA_Subsidize_Nordic_Farms_desc:0 "The Nordic farmers are what keeps this federation fed. It would only be right to support their work for this great federation by subsidising their activities, lowering their prices and giving them an edge over the competition."
SCA_Solidify_Federal_Unity:0 "Solidify Federal Unity"
SCA_Solidify_Federal_Unity_desc:0 "We should encourage the consolidation of the federal identity, ensuring that Nordic citizens shall view themselves as just that rather than as Danes, Norwegians and Swedes primarily."

SCA_Merge_the_National_Armies:0 "Merge the National Armies"
SCA_Merge_the_National_Armies_desc:0 "It is highly inefficient to maintain three separate armies for one federation, despite the close cooperation. We should merge them all into a single army with a single command structure."
SCA_Jungs_Mobile_Warfare:0 "Jung's Mobile Warfare"
SCA_Jungs_Mobile_Warfare_desc:0 "The Swedish general Helge Jung proposes we invest in the motorisation of the army. This will give us an advantage in manoeuvring throughout the stretched lands of Scandinavia and in the battlefield."

SCA_Maintain_Separate_Militaries_desc:0 "While purely from the perspective of efficiency, a single merged army is best, it will be significantly easier to motivate the people's of our federation to fight under their own flag under that of the federation, where they may be subject to language differences as well."

SCA_Atlantic_Blue_Water:0 "Atlantic Focus: Blue Water Navy"
SCA_Atlantic_Blue_Water_desc:0 "The primary aim of our navy is to give our federation influence on the grander theatre. A significant presence in the Atlantic is an objective towards reaching that goal. We should focus on making our navy ocean-worthy."

SCA_Scandinavian_Highway:0 "The Pan-Scandinavian Highway"
SCA_Scandinavian_Highway_desc:0 "We should work on building a highway that connects the far reaches of our federation with each other, increasing the amount of people interacting and mending cultural differences as a result. After all, if it is easy to go to Sweden, why stay only in Norway?"
SCA_Plan_a_Bridge_over_Oresund:0 "Design an Oresund Bridge"
SCA_Plan_a_Bridge_over_Oresund_desc:0 "The Oresund dividing Zealand in Denmark from Scania in Sweden is a broader body of water than ever bridged before, but if we are to finally take away the cultural differences between our nations it is paramount to build one. This will likely still take decades however."
SCA_Plan_a_Bridge_over_the_Belt:0 "Design a Belt Bridge"
SCA_Plan_a_Bridge_over_the_Belt_desc:0 "The other side of the coin is bridging the rest of the belt. While it all is part of our Danish member state making the cultural isolation a bit less intense comparatively, it would still be economically very beneficial to bridge the bodies of water. At current however, this too would still take decades."
SCA_Stockholm_Berlin_by_Train:0 "Stockholm to Berlin by Train?"
SCA_Stockholm_Berlin_by_Train_desc:0 "If the aforementioned bridges were constructed, this would allow us to connect Scandinavia to the train net of mainland Europe, without the need to go through Russia.

SCA_Nationalism_fades_away_desc:0 "Our efforts at expanding the interactions of the Nordic people in cultural and economic sense is paying off; while some will of course always remain stalwart nationalists, at least the amount of people identifying as Nordic citizen rather than say a Swedish citizen is lower than ever."

nordic_formation.16.d:0 "The other Scandinavian countries have agreed to our proposal regarding federation. According to its constitution, the Nordic Federation will, for now until it can be addressed by a proper federal government of course, be a democratic, federal monarchy. The executive will consists of a federal government, which holds power on behalf of a council consisting of the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish monarchs.

The government must ensure that all constituent countries are equally represented when transferring the office from one head of state to the other.\nArt. 36:\nWith these words, the matter of the head of the federation is settled: while not strictly codified as such in the end, each Nordic head of state will act as head of state for the federation for a period of 4 years."

While they decided to go for the name of 'Nordic Social Democratic Workers Party', this sobriquet was enthusiastically adopted by the younger socialists, although the leader of the Danish youth wing, Hans Hedtoft, did clarify that the Nordic Social Democratic Party does not endorse syndicalism in any way. According to him, the name appeals based on the second internationale. Regardless of this, the decision of who will lead this party has come up. While all involved share a similar ideology, their origins are all from different nations. At the first confrence of the party, the nationality of the party's first leader is..."

scandinavia.13.t:0 "Formation of the Conservative Party"
scandinavia.13.d:0 "Several conservative parties around the federation have announced a fusion to optimally partake in the federal elections that are to be held soon. This alliance includes the parts of the Norwegian Høyre party as well as both the Danish Venstre party and the Danish DKF party, which has left experts predicting that Denmark will be the main base of this party, even if it will still be a hotly contested region considering the strong presence of the social democrats. In Sweden, the traditional conservatives have joined this party, although some among them look with a certain suspicion to the limited commitment to some of the values of conservatism embraced in this new party, despite the name. Some members of the Swedish riksdag abandoned the party even completely when they agreed to join, leaving them independents. Regardless of this, the decision of who will lead this party has come up. While all involved share a similar ideology, their origins are all from different nations. At the first confrence of the party, the nationality of the party's first leader is..."

scandinavia.14.t:0 "Formation of the Liberal Party"
scandinavia.14.d:0 "Board members from the Swedish Folkpartiet, the Danish Radikale Venstre and the Norwegian Venstre parties have declared their intention in the federal capital of Göteborg today to run together as the Liberal Party in the soon-to-be-held Nordic elections. As this group is composed of mostly smaller parties, experts predict that they will have a difficult time actually winning these elections, but they might well become influential as a smaller party as the junior party in a future coalition. Regardless of this, the decision of who will lead this party has come up. While all involved share a similar ideology, their origins are all from different nations. At the first confrence of the party, the nationality of the party's first leader is..."

scandinavia.15.t:0 "The Unification of Trade Unions"
scandinavia.15.d:0 "As it becomes clear that the Nordic countries are starting to embark on a united path, the labour movement has not been sitting still. The Trade Union Congresses of Denmark, Sweden and Norway have convened in the Swedish capital of Stockholm. Here they voted to unify all three organisation into an even higher congress known as the Nordic Trade Union Congress. Unsurprisingly, the syndicalist elements followed suit in this, in spite of their alleged opposition to the Nordic project, meaning a unified syndicalist cause now exists on the Nordic level."
scandinavia.15.a:0 "Lightly worrying indeed..."

scandinavia.16.t:0 "Ratification of the Constitution"
scandinavia.16.d:0 "The Federal Constitution has been formalized. In a festive ambiance, it has been symbolically accepted by the federal parliament and then been signed by the each of the monarchs of the member states in the new federal capital of Gothenburg. With this, the Federation has finally been made official and the constitution has been empowered. A truly glorious day for the boreal nations of Scandinavia!"
scandinavia.16.a:0 "Hurrah!"

scandinavia.17.t:0 "Switching of the Guard"
scandinavia.17.d:0 "As the constitution provides, the chairman of the federation revolves between the monarchs of the constituent member states. 2 years have passed, and it is time for the next monarch to take this role upon themselves."
scandinavia.17.a:0 "Hurrah!"

scandinavia.18.t:0 "The Farmer's Party Merges with the Conservatives"
scandinavia.18.d:0 "Agrarian parties are a curious phenomenon in Northern European, especially Scandinavian politics that defend the interests. Naturally, they did not sit still as the Nordic countries are uniting and they too have formed their own unified party to compete in the elections. These parties generally trend to the right, and have taken up an alliance with the Conservative parties to form a united bloc. With a United Bloc forming, the question of leadership has emerged. Who emerges as head of the Conservative-Agrarian Bloc?"
scandinavia.18.a:0 "A Swedish Conservative Candidate!"
scandinavia.18.b:0 "A Danish Conservative Candidate!"
scandinavia.18.c:0 "A Norwegian Agrarian Candidate!"

scandinavia.19.t:0 "The Formation of the Nordic Federation"
scandinavia.19.d:0 "Delegates from Sweden, Norway and Denmark convened this morning in Stockholm to finalize a resolution for the federalization of the three countries into one entity. Known now as the Nordic Federation, many political analysts have been debating what this will mean for the future of the balance of power in Europe. While some believe that the liberal ideas of the federation align with the interests of the Entente, most agree that the new nation will likely take a stance of neutrality on all matters. The balance of power once again shifts on the world stage."
scandinavia.19.a:0 "The Northern Lights Shine Bright"

scandinavia.20.t:0 "The Fate of Nordic Unity"
scandinavia.20.d:0 "Despite its modern foundations rooted in peaceful cooperation and cohesion through diplomacy and compromise, the Nordicist idea and the wider concept of a united Nordic region of Scandinavia has existed in some form or another for centuries, and yet since the days of the Kalmar Union, we are the only ones to truly unite our homeland once again. From the icy volcanoes and stormy seas of Iceland to the high mountains of Norway, through the dense forests of Sweden and the islands of Denmark, and even into the lands of the Finns, our region is finally one. Now, we must decide the fate of this beautiful and historic land as we begin to look inward for the betterment of our united people."

BUL_reorganize_veteran_payments:0 "Reorganize Veteran Pensions"
BUL_reorganize_veteran_payments_desc:0 "The current system of veteran pensions is simply unsustainable. Recognizing this, our government proposed to minimize them and spread them out more in time.

kxbul.4.b:0 "This might give us more attention than we need."

kxbul.5.t:0 "The Bulgars Anew"
kxbul.5.d:0 "With the Bulgars re-established as a culture and people, it is only logical we take what's ours. The Volga will run red with the blood of the Russians - then it shall be washed over by the beautiful blue everyone knows. And thus with the bleeding Volga shall the world know that we are indeed what we say we are."
kxbul.5.a:0 "And reclaim our legacy we shall!"

kxbul.6.t:0 "The Successor"

kxbul.6.a:0 "Good luck!"

kxbul.7.t:0 "Tatar Immigrants"
kxbul.7.d:0 "The Tatars in Russia and Asia have been flocking to Bulgaria lately. Most of these people happen to be Volga Bulgarians.

kxbul.8.d:0 "The Tatars of Bulgaria wish for us to donate to their brethren who did not embark on the journey to Bulgaria, and fund their movements and people - along with small pensions to those who did immigrate to Bulgaria.

kxbul.10.a:0 "A Tatar in Parliament?"

kxbul.11.t:0 "Rising Tatar sympathy in the government"
kxbul.11.d:0 "The whispers in Parliament that do end up getting intercepted by other ears speak of the Tatars. And not of how bad they are, but of how the Tatar situation is poor and how we should seek to better it, especially the Volga Tatars. It seems that Gajaz Ishaki has been preaching to our Parliament unnoticed..."

kxbul.15.a:0 "Ishaki doesn't seem right in the head anymore."

kxbul.20.t:0 "Riots!"
kxbul.20.d:0 "The radical shift in leadership has resulted in a flurry of rioting across the nation. Buildings burn, people fight, and the economy dives. Ishaki has considered sending in the army before, but now there is no better choice..."

kxbul.21.d:0 "Our incendiary weaponry has been tested on targets, only for an effect much more devastating that what we originally expected. Incinerating everything in sight, hellifying the land, our new weapons will bring nothing but terror for the enemy on the battlefield."

With such blatant chaos occurring... many seek a new leader.\nThis day will rest sorrowfully in the minds of all Bulgarians."

GER_deutschland_ber_alles_desc:0 "Our hard work has paid off! We have absolute control over the Reich and the dominance of our government and party in will remain unchallenged for a long time! Now all that remains is to ensure that Kurt von Schleicher succeeds in keeping the interests of the Junkers and his other allies in balance, otherwise it could be extremely uncomfortable for him..."

GER_subsidies_for_junker_companies_desc:0 "As a result of Black Monday, some of the Junkers who support us got into serious financial distress and are on the verge of losing their lands and their companies. In order to prevent us from losing their support, we should provide subsidies to ensure that they get back on their feet quickly, otherwise this could cause us serious problems. It'll raise some questions as to why we are giving help to these companies, but we'll be able to present some plausible explanation to the Reichstag for sure!"

#GER_kurt_von_schleichers_chancellorship:0 "Kurt von Schleicher's Chancellorship"
#GER_kurt_von_schleichers_chancellorship_desc:0 "The Kaiser made Kurt von Schleicher Reichskanzler on the basis of his promise that he would decisively suppress the influence of the liberals and socialists and maintain the status quo in German society. But as it turned out, the new Reichskanzler also has his own plans for the Reich and some very powerful allies who support him..."

GER_kurt_von_schleichers_chancellorship:0 "Kurt von Schleicher's Chancellorship"
GER_kurt_von_schleichers_chancellorship_desc:0 "The Kaiser made von Schleicher Reichskanzler due to his promises to secure Germany against threats both from the democrats as well as the Junkers. However, now that he has his office, Schleicher has been restaffing important offices and making contracts with Junker companies, and some people whisper about a sinister plan to get the Junker into power after all..."

GER_reassign_key_government_posts:0 "Reassign Key Government Posts"
GER_reassign_key_government_posts_desc:0 "The Kaiser demanded that we fill some important ministerial posts in our government with members of his preferred party, the Deutschkonservative Partei. That put a little damper on our plans, but Franz von Papen, the leader of the DkP is a personal friend and ally of Kurt von Schleicher, has a solution ready. He will replace the ministers chosen by the Kaiser who are not allied with us with persons loyal to our cause, on the basis of 'party internal restructuring'."

GER_influence_the_reichstag:0 "Influence the Reichstag"
GER_influence_the_reichstag_desc:0 "It is no secret that there are people in the Reichstag who are hostile to us and suspect that our ambitions may be far greater than we admit. In order to silence these voices quickly, we should first find out who we could get on our side and whom we must condemn into political insignificance. A banquet should be an excellent way to get in touch with the members of the Reichstag."

GER_establish_a_stronger_government:0 "Establish a Stronger Government"
GER_establish_a_stronger_government_desc:0 "In order to increase control of our government, we must continue to expand our network of allies and supporters. Logically we should try to strengthen our ties with the Junkers and industrialists, but it is rumored that there is yet another influential circle around a well-known person whose support could be of advantage to us..."

GER_the_kanzler_and_his_loyal_friends:0 "The Kanzler and His Loyal Friends"
GER_the_kanzler_and_his_loyal_friends_desc:0 "The Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher is known for having many influential friends in all corners of the Reich and since one can never get along well enough, it makes sense to regularly do something together to maintain their loyalty and support. And what could be better than having a party! Get wine and champagne, my friends are coming to visit!"

GER_the_kanzler_and_the_statthalter_desc:0 "After the successful talks with the Alldeutsche Verband and its new chairman Statthalter Hermann von Göring, he was appointed as the new Vizekanzler, which means we have now access to his extensive network of friends in the military and the colonial societies. We should show our appreciation and implement a few of his suggestions and reforms, it will certainly not be dangerous for us, because how hungry for power could a single person get in the worst case, hm?"

GER_radical_antisyndicalist_propaganda:0 "Radical Anti-Syndicalist Propaganda"
GER_radical_antisyndicalist_propaganda_desc:0 "In order to increase the readiness for war and the morale for the coming conflict with the International, the Vizekanzler has demanded that we start a propaganda campaign against syndicalism, which targets both, the member states of the international as well as domestic socialist parties and unions . Every German must abysmally abhor syndicalism in order for us to be victorious in the coming war! And any form of weakness could lead to our downfall!"

GER_use_von_grings_influence:0 "Use von Göring's Influence"
GER_use_von_grings_influence_desc:0 "Now that we have been working with Göring for a while, we have passed some of the reforms he demanded. Now is the time to deepen this collaboration. Göring has agreed that he'll give us greater support if we grant him additional privileges. He demanded that he be appointed 'Reichspolizeimarschall' and thus head of the police. This seems to be acceptable, we get money and information and Göring can play cop, well if he enjoys it should he be allowed to, or not?"

GER_take_action_against_liberal_and_socialist_threats:0 "Take Action Against Liberal and Socialist Threats"
GER_take_action_against_liberal_and_socialist_threats_desc:0 "The opposition in the Reichstag has been significantly thinned out, but some parties like the SPD or FVP are still a thorn in our side. They use every opportunity to expose us in the Reichstag and to reveal ridiculous evidence of our alleged 'anti-democratic machinations'. Perhaps it is time for us to have some of our critics checked by the Preußische Geheimpolizei and see whether they are the ones who abuse the trust of the people? A thorough investigation will reveal the truth!"

GER_empower_the_verdeckte_reichspolizei:0 "Nationalize the Preußische Geheimpolizei"
GER_empower_the_verdeckte_reichspolizei_desc:0 "Our powerful domestic secret service, the Preußische Geheimpolizei, is a brilliant example of German efficiency and excellent training! But we can make it even more efficient by bringing its operations out of the confines of Prussian land system, thus lifting certain restrictions that have prevented it from going to the extreme for the protection of the Reich! No one should be allowed to escape the grip of the police when the fate of the entire Reich is at stake!"

GER_solidify_the_position_of_the_kamarilla_desc:0 "Now that we have control of the Reichs power apparatus, it is time we manifest our influence in the Reichstag. That is why we will transform our previously loose association into a real political party - the Deutschnationale Volkspartei. Our supporters, who have so far been independent members of the Reichstag, and some opposition politicians who support our goals, will form the DVLP parliamentary group and thus secure legitimacy for our political actions."

GER_restructure_the_oberste_heeresleitung:0 "Restructure the Oberste Heeresleitung"
GER_restructure_the_oberste_heeresleitung_desc:0 "The Oberste Heeresleitung consists of the elite of our officer corps and makes all important decisions regarding our army. Unfortunately, some of the officers there are not particularly willing to cooperate with us. Perhaps it is time to take some of the senior generals into their well-earned retirement. And we will simply transfer the younger, more ambitious officers to our most distant colonies, where they can continue to serve the Reich, but no longer pose a threat to our goals."

GER_use_the_wealth_of_the_junkers:0 "Use the Wealth of the Junkers"
GER_use_the_wealth_of_the_junkers_desc:0 "Our plan is working perfectly, the opposition has been almost eliminated, the press has been brought into line and our allies are united behind us. However, we cannot just stop now. We'll ask the Junkers to reinvest part of their newly acquired wealth in projects preferred by our government, for example, to provide equipment for our brave soldiers or to finance soup kitchens for the poor. That will certainly increase our popularity with the troops and the people!"

GER_undermine_the_power_of_the_dkp:0 "Undermine the Power of the DkP"
GER_undermine_the_power_of_the_dkp_desc:0 "The DkP is the largest conservative party in German politics. We know that many of their members support our goals, but are not ready to turn their backs on their party as they fear losing their influence. That is why we asked Franz von Papen to select some important people in the DkP to join the DVLP in order to reduce the doubts of the others. If everything goes according plan, we will separate the wheat from the chaff and remove the people in the DkP who stand in our way."

GER_the_kaiser__our_figurehead:0 "The Kaiser - Our Figurehead"
GER_the_kaiser__our_figurehead_desc:0 "Through many secret intrigues and exchanges of the Kaisers staff, we succeeded in isolating him completely from politics in the empire. He now only receives information that has been directly approved by us and only serves as a figurehead, but who has no real power. He sits like a bird in a cage: You can still see and hear him, but he can no longer act freely without us noticing."

GER_drinks_with_the_crown_prince_desc:0 "In contrast to his father, the Kronprinz is an intelligent man who has understood that only the DVLP (and the Junkers of course) can lead Germany into a better future. In order to deepen this bond, the Reichskanzler and the Kronprinz will meet for a fine wine tasting, where they can discuss their common plans for the Reich."

### Events ###

ger_schleicher.1.t:0 "Reichskanzler von Schleicher's Chancellorship"
ger_schleicher.1.d:0 "After Kurt von Schleicher intrigued behind the scenes in the last few years and deliberately manipulated confidants of the Kaiser, he finally achieved his goal: \nThe Kaiser finally believes that only von Schleicher is able to protect the Reich from the threat of the Syndicalists, the Democrats and the Junkers alike and to maintain the old order in the country and has therefore now appointed him Reichskanzler. \nWhat the Kaiser unfortunately doesn't know is that his new Reichskanzler is forging completely different plans. \nWhile he has announced that he wants to completely renew the Reich both socially and economically through his personal heart project, the Reichsrefomplan, in order to lead Germany back to the top after the devastating effects of Black Monday, in truth all of this is just a lot of talk about nothing. \nIn the past Kurt von Schleicher made friends with powerful Junkers, who see their traditional influence and power endangered by the advancing democratization of the Reich and by Wilhelm II's extremely negative attitude towards them. \nSince von Schleicher has now made a considerable fortune through his new friends and his influence continues to grow, he is now trying to secretly stop the wheel of time in his new position as Reichskanzler in order to preserve his power and wealth, that he loves so much. \nBut whether he will be able to keep his hideous machinations a secret from the Kaiser and how his Highness would react if he should notice this betrayal remains to be seen..."
ger_schleicher.1.a:0 "Don't worry! My plan will work without any problems, I promise!"

ger_schleicher.2.t:0 "The Reichskanzler and the Banquet"
ger_schleicher.2.d:0 "Today is an important day for our Reichskanzler: \nHe has invited all members of the Reichstag, powerful industrialists, nobles from all over the Reich and influential public figures to a large banquet at his estate. \nOfficially, this event serves to promote contacts between politics, business and civil society, but the Reichskanzler has a completely different goal. \nHe and his allies want to use this event to find out how they can best manipulate or pressure the people present so that they can either be enthusiastic about our cause or, alternatively, do not pose any danger to our ambitions. To ensure this, it was arranged that loyal allies would be positioned in strategic locations at the event to ensure that as much information as possible is collected and that contacts are made with possible allies who could serve our cause.\n\nAfter an exuberant evening full of exquisite dishes, the finest alcohol, harmonious music and a friendly atmosphere throughout the event, Kurt von Schleicher and his allies drew their balance the next morning: \nThey found that there is much more support for their cause within the elite of the Reich than they initially thought. They were able to arrange that some members of the Reichstag from other parties would try to secretly paralyze their parliamentary groups with procedural questions so that they can further expand their influence. Furthermore, some industrialists have promised them their financial support. \nOn the other hand, they have also been able to find extremely delicate information about their political enemies, which they can use to help them take early retirement should they become dangerous to them."
ger_schleicher.2.a:0 "Cheers to the successful Banquet and our new 'Friends'!"

ger_schleicher.3.t:0 "An evening to be remembered"
ger_schleicher.3.d:0 "On a beautiful evening somewhere in the wine cellar of one of the most exquisite wineries in the entire Reich, one of the most important meetings of the whole year should begin in a few minutes. Pretty much everyone of rank and name was present: \nWell-known industrialists, officers and nobles who all had one thing in common: \nThey are allies of the Reichskanzler and the Junkers. \nBut the evening's guest of honor was the Kronprinz of the Reich, Wilhelm Prinz von Preußen. \nThe meeting was scheduled because both the Kronprinz and von Schleicher agreed that the Kaiser apparently no longer had the strength or willpower to recognize that only a strong government and a strong military would win the coming war with the International. \nBut a government can only achieve this goal if it is not constantly exposed to the risk of losing its ability to act just because an election has robbed it of its majority in the Reichstag. \nIt is also important to have powerful allies, like the Junkers, who are extremely well connected and can obtain both information and money. \nBut the Aging Kaiser doesn't want to recognize this, as he fears for his own personal power. \nFortunately for us, the Kronprinz is a wise man and has assured his friend the Reichskanzler tonight that he will support us to isolate his father as much as possible from everyday political life in the Reich and that we have his blessing for further centralizing the power of the government. In return, however, he wants to be accepted as a leader in our inner circle and to be involved in all of our financial profits. \nIn view of the fact that this will give us the support of the next Kaiser this is a small price to pay, which is why those present unanimously agreed to this demand. \nThe rest of the evening was very cheerful after the formation of this powerful alliance, much more expensive wine was drunk because money played no role here anymore and everyone had got what they wanted: \nThe Junkers almost unlimited influence, the Kronprinz a powerful network of loyal allies and the Reichskanzler now access to almost absolute power."
ger_schleicher.3.a:0 "Let's toast to this alliance and the Kronprinz! Lang lebe Deutschland!"

ger_schleicher.4.t:0 "An offer that you can't refuse?"
ger_schleicher.4.d:0 "Next weekend there will be a big party in the villa of the von Schleicher family, to which the Reichskanzlers closest friends and supporters are invited. It is officially a party, but the main purpose of the gathering is to discuss new plans and to exchange information and news from all over the Reich. \nThe preparations are already in full swing, but this morning there was a strange letter on the Reichskanzlers desk. In this letter, the Statthalter of Mittelafrika Hermann von Göring asks for a meeting with Kurt von Schleicher to discuss the 'future of the entire Reich'. \nHe would like to discuss the further details in a personal conversation, which is why he would be happy to invite the Reichskanzler to a noble restaurant next Saturday, for which he has already reserved a table, as he is currently on a work trip in Berlin. \nUnfortunately, the party at the von Schleichers' home is already planned for the same day and Kurt cannot be in two places at the same time. \nAnd apart from that, should a person like Göring be trusted at all? \nIt is true that the Statthalter is very well connected and has a lot of influence, but on the other hand he is also known for his quick-tempered behavior and his rather radical political views.\n\nSo should Kurt really be meeting him in secret or not?"
ger_schleicher.4.a:0 "No, I have no time for such nonsense!"
ger_schleicher.4.b:0 "Agree to the meeting with Göring. But the preparations for the festival should continue!"

ger_schleicher.5.t:0 "A meeting with Statthalter von Göring"
ger_schleicher.5.d:0 "At around 7 p.m. Kurt von Schleicher entered the restaurant where he was supposed to meet Hermann von Göring. \nA waiter accompanied him into an adjoining room, in which the Statthalter was already waiting for him. \nAfter the two had greeted each other, they sat down and talked about their possible cooperation. \nGöring made it clear that he is convinced that our government could benefit greatly from his extensive contacts in the military, business and the Reichskolonialamt, as he could get people to support us who were previously hostile toour cause. In addition, he promises that this cooperation will raise huge sums of money for us, because his 'friends' are the owners of large companies in the Reich that would love to support us with donations. \nIn return, Göring demands that we appoint him as minister in the cabinet and unite the AV, of which he has been secretly the chairman for some time, with the DVLP, as we did before with the DkP. \nWithout question, our association would benefit from this proposal and our influence would grow, but it also carries just as many risks, which is why the decision should be made with caution. \nThere is still enough time to reject Göring's ambitions and to get to the party in his villa, but Kurt has to make a decision here and now."
ger_schleicher.5.a:0 "Accept the offer. Franz von Papen will represent me as host at the party!"
ger_schleicher.5.b:0 "Decline this outrageous offer! Prepare to leave for my estate now!"

ger_schleicher.6.t:0 "Statthalter von Göring returns from Mittelafrika!"
ger_schleicher.6.d:0 "Now that all formalities had been dealt with and the final preparations had been made, it was time for the new Außenminister to be sworn in. This should be none other than the Statthalter of Mittelafrika Hermann von Göring.\n\nAlthough this personnel decision initially irritated some in the DVLP and among the Junkers, after the Reichskanzler had explained the new situation to the party leadership, most of them silenced their doubts about the Statthalters suitability for this post.\n\nThe ceremony went almost as expected, with the exception that Hermann von Göring, after taking his oath, gave the Reichskanzler a baby lion as a present to thank him for his hard work for the Reich and he said that he looks forward to working together."
ger_schleicher.6.a:0 "Welcome back from Afrika, Herr Außenminister!"

ger_schleicher.7.t:0 "A feast with the Reichskanzler!"
ger_schleicher.7.d:0 "After Kurt had turned down the ridiculous offer of the power-hungry Statthalter, the weekend had come when the festival with his friends and allies took place in his villa. \nThere were a large number of guests present, but the main event of the evening took place behind closed doors.\nKurt left his wife Elisabeth to take care of the guests while he was in the next room. There was a meeting with potential supporters who wanted to join the DVLP and our secret alliance in order to secure a place in our new regime. \nThe two generals and the three businessmen in question sat at the table with von Schleicher and von Papen and assured them that they would accept the conditions that they were given. The businessmen thus give us access to their connections and the generals assured us that they would use their influence in the army to convince more officers to join the DVLP. \nIn return, the five will be put on our payroll, which will help them to make a small fortune in the near future.\n\nAfter everything had been agreed, the party continued until late into the night, until the last guests finally left the Schleichers' villa at around 2 a.m. and made their way home."
ger_schleicher.7.a:0 "What a nice party it was! The Reichskanzler knows how to treat his guests properly!"

ger_schleicher.8.t:0 "A request from the DkP"
ger_schleicher.8.d:0 "This morning the Reichskanzler received an 'extremely surprising' request: \nThe party leadership of what was once the strongest party in the Reich, the DkP, asks the DVLP to merge both parties. \nSince the DkP, after its massive loss of membership to our party, from its own point of view, no longer has the ability to achieve larger political goals and parliamentary majorities on its own, they see no other option than to join us in order to retain at least some of their former influence. \nWe owe this success to the skillful action of Franz von Papen, who was able to convince enough influential party members to join our cause and more or less threw the DkP into chaos, as a massive number of members switched to the DVLP in the last few days. \nSince important posts were suddenly vacant and the party was unable to counteract the exodus, the remaining party leadership had no choice but to seek unification with the DVLP at von Papen's suggestion. \nKurt von Schleicher secretly congratulated his friend on his good work and then announced on the radio that all remaining DkP members can join the DVLP if they wish and that he is looking forward to the closer cooperation."
ger_schleicher.8.a:0 "Gemeinsam für ein stärkeres Reich!"

ger_schleicher.9.t:0 "The new Statthalter"
ger_schleicher.9.d:0 "Since Hermann von Göring has now taken up his post as foreign minister at home in the Reich, the post of Statthalter of Mittelafrika is now vacant. \nBefore he left, von Göring recommended to the Reichskanzler that Reinhard Heyrdrich, a striving star within the Neue Kolonialgruppe, should take over his post. \nAfter careful consideration, the Reichskanzler agreed to von Göring's proposal and hereby congratulates the new Statthalter Heydrich on his appointment!"
ger_schleicher.9.a:0 "Viel Erfolg, Herr Statthalter Heydrich!"

# A quiet night? #
ger_schleicher.10.t:0 "Ein Sonderbarer Sonntag"
ger_schleicher.10.d:0 "Around two o'clock in the morning on a quiet Sunday night Kurt von Schleicher and his wife were asleep in their bed when the Reichskanzler suddenly woke up because he heard strange noises that sounded as if someone was trying to break into the house. \nHis wife also woke up and asked him if it could be burglars.\n\n'Stay here Elisabeth, I'll see what's going on down there!' he said.\n\nKurt then took his pistol out of his bedside table and crept slowly and quietly out of the room towards the stairs. \nOnce there, he looked through a window and saw that his two guards were lying lifeless in the front yard and that several men were about to crack the front door! Kurt was now sure that these were not simple burglars, but murderers who were supposed to kill him!\n\nHe thought about what he could do: \nHis guards are dead. He is armed, but alone and the men are certainly armed too. Then there was Elisabeth, who was alone in the bedroom and could only guess what was going on. \nIn the current situation, Kurt only had two options: \nEither he tries to defeat the murderer himself with his pistol and hopes that a police patrol nearby would notice the shots, which could quickly be fatal if he were hit, or he tries to get into the back garden with Elisabeth through the bedroom window in order to escape, but that carries the risk that more murderers were waiting for them there.\n\nHow should Kurt decide?"
ger_schleicher.10.a:0 "Kurt decides to face the murderers!"

# Fight the murderers! #

ger_schleicher.11.t:0 "The fight at the front door!"
ger_schleicher.11.d:0 "After carefully considering his limited options, Kurt decided to face the intruders in battle. Because a German officer doesn't flee like a coward!\n\nHe knew, however, that if he failed, not only would he probably lose his life, these bastards would probably also murder his beloved Elisabeth! He couldn't fail now, with so much at stake!\n\nHe looked for a protected position with a clear line of fire on the front door and waited for the inevitable. Then the intruders finally cracked the door and quietly entered the house. There were five men, each armed with a pistol. They were completely ignorant that Kurt had long since targeted them with his own pistol! \nWhen two of them turned their backs on Kurt to go up the stairs, he took the opportunity and fired! \nHe hit both of them and they fell backwards down the stairs. The other three were completely taken by surprise and initially panicked, which gave Kurt the opportunity to shoot another intruder. \nShortly afterwards, the other two regrouped and fired in his direction. A merciless firefight broke out in the house and Kurt had a hard time keeping the two shooters at bay at the same time. But then he managed to take out another one! After another nerve-wracking minutes, Kurt finally managed to get a free line of fire, but his opponent had him in his sights as well, then two shots were fired and one of the two was hit.\n\nAnd the one hit was..."
ger_schleicher.11.a:0 "...the killer! Elisabeth! Call the police immediately!"
ger_schleicher.11.b:0 "...Kurt! And his last words were: Forgive me, Elisabeth..."

# Escape through the back garden! #

ger_schleicher.12.t:0 "Escape through the back garden!"
ger_schleicher.12.d:0 "After carefully considering his limited options,Kurt decided to venture out through the back garden, only a fool would face five armed enemies alone!\n\nHe went quietly back into the bedroom and told Elisabeth what was going on. She started crying and asked him, 'Why do these men want to kill us Kurt? Why?' \n'I don't know either, but we absolutely have to get out of here! These criminals already killed Herbert and Gustav outside, if we want to survive we have to flee now! Put your shoes!' \nThey made their way quietly out of the bedroom into Kurt's study, Kurt looked out the window into the dark garden and looked for movement, but it seemed like nobody was there. \nAt that moment they heard the front door being broken down below and several people entering the house.\n\nThey climbed down over the balcony into the garden and ran towards the garden gate. But when they stepped into the street and crossed it, they saw two armed people running in their direction and opening fire. Kurt pushed Elisabeth into cover behind a parked delivery truck and returned fire. He could see that the five attackers who had broken into their house came out of the garden and joined the other two men. Somehow Kurt and Elisabeth managed to get through to the main street, where they could already hear the police sirens. When they were almost there one last shot was fired and it hit Kurt and he fell on the pavement. \nA few moments later the police finally arrived and opened fire on the attackers. \nAfter a few minutes of fighting, the police gained the upper hand: Five of the attackers were dead and two managed to escape. \nWhen an ambulance arrived to take care of the Reichskanzler, Elisabeth knelt next to her husband and held his hand and it became clear that the bullet..."

# Schleicher survives! 1#

ger_schleicher.13.t:0 "The morning after"
ger_schleicher.13.d:0 "Shortly before 3 p.m., just a few hours after he and his wife were almost murdered, Chancellor von Schleicher was sitting in his office and listening to the latest police reports about the reasons for the attack on him. \nThe chief investigator of the Berlin police and the chief of the secret service informed him that one of the attackers had survived the fight seriously injured and had already been treated and interrogated in a military hospital outside Berlin. And the results of that interrogation have revealed some extremely worrying findings. \nAccording to the investigators, all of the attackers were ordinary members of the working class who became unemployed and destitute as a result of Black Monday. In addition, they were all former members of the Alldeutsche VErband and then members of an underground movement committed to the “Purity of the German Race” and other esoteric ideologies. \nAccording to the latest findings, this group is financed and equipped privately through many discreet detours by current members of the DVLP, people who previously belonged to the AV and are now members of the Reichstag after the merger of both parties! The most prominent among these people is Ernst Röhm, who is considered to be influential and a close confidante of Vizekanzler Hermann von Göring. He and his accomplices have been shown to have secretly passed money and information on to the group of assassins several times in the past few months. And now comes the most shocking part: \nThe investigators are absolutely certain that a conspiracy of this magnitude could never have been started without the personal consent of von Göring. \nKurt von Schleicher went to the window and thought about it and it all made sense. \nNow that the Kaiser was more or less an unsuspecting puppet of the Junkers, a potential new Reichskanzler only needed the approval of his patrons to take over the office and he knew that von Göring had done massive lobbying in the last few months to gain greater influence . He also knew that the former Statthalter of Mittelafrika was never satisfied with just being Vizekanzler, he wanted more. And as long as  is alive, he never had a chance to become Reichskanzler, so it was only logical that von Göring would have him murdered by a fake 'incident' so he could finally lay his claim to the Kanzlerschaft. \nKurt had to smile, he had actually underestimated Göring's thirst for power. But this tragedy was now over! \nWith his signature he gave the order for the arrest and immediate execution of von Göring and his co-conspirators for high treason against the German Empire."

ger_schleicher.14.d:0 "Shortly before 3 p.m., Vizekanzler Hermann von Göring was on the way to an emergency session of the Reichstag, where he had to inform the Reichstag and the citizens of the Reich about the 'tragic' death of Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher. \nWhen he entered the Reichstag he saw that the plenary hall and the grandstand were both occupied to the last seat and that everyone was talking excitedly. Everyone awaited the election of a new Reichskanzler and the explanation of the circumstances surrounding the death of Kurt von Schleicher. \nAfter a short address by the Reichstagspräsident, who emphasized the seriousness of the situation, a vote was taken on the appointment of the new Reichskanzler, which von Göring won almost unanimously against the SPD candidate thanks to the support of his party. \nThe Reichstagspräsident gave von Göring the floor and he went to the lectern, the whole hall became quiet and all eyes were only on him. He had waited and worked towards this moment for so long and now it was finally his time to shine. \n'Herr Reichstagspräsident and honorable members of the Reichstag! Today I have the sad duty to inform you and the citizens of our Reich about the circumstances that led to the murder of Kurt von Schleicher! \nFirst the only good news: the police and secret service investigators managed to arrest one of the seven murderers alive, the others were shot while trying to escape. The arrested killer has been interrogated and he has already confessed to the heinous act! \nThe intruders were members of various socialist and syndicalist groups who were verifiably provided with funds and information by agents of the Commune of France in order to carry out the assassination attempt on Herr von Schleicher! \nTo the best of our knowledge, the situation played out as follows: \nThis morning at around 2 a.m., the assassins forcibly gained access to the Reichskanzlers property, first killing his two bodyguards and then breaking into the house. Meanwhile, he and his wife lay asleep in their bed, unsuspecting what was happening out there. It was only when the murderers were standing in front of the bedroom door that he apparently woke up because of the step noises, because he was found in front of his bed with his pistol in hand, his wife Elisabeth was shot in the bed when the police found her, she didn't even have a chance to fight back. Herr von Schleicher was able to take out one of the murderers, who was lying dead in front of the bedroom.'"

# Schleicher survives! 2#

ger_schleicher.15.t:0 "The morning after"
ger_schleicher.15.d:0 "Shortly before 3 p.m., only a few hours after he and his wife were almost murdered, Chancellor von Schleicher was lying in his bed in the Charité and listening to the latest police reports about the reasons for the attack on him. \nThe chief investigator of the Berlin police and the chief of the secret service informed him that one of the attackers had survived the fight seriously injured and had already been treated and interrogated in a military hospital outside Berlin. And the results of that interrogation have revealed some extremely worrying findings. \nAccording to the investigators, all of the attackers were ordinary members of the working class who became unemployed and destitute as a result of Black Monday. In addition, they were all former members of the Alldeutsche VErband and then members of an underground movement committed to the “Purity of the German Race” and other esoteric ideologies. \nAccording to the latest findings, this group is financed and equipped privately through many discreet detours by current members of the DVLP, people who previously belonged to the AV and are now members of the Reichstag after the merger of both parties! The most prominent among these people is Ernst Röhm, who is considered to be influential and a close confidante of Vizekanzler Hermann von Göring. He and his accomplices have been shown to have secretly passed money and information on to the group of assassins several times in the past few months. And now comes the most shocking part: \nThe investigators are absolutely certain that a conspiracy of this magnitude could never have been started without the personal consent of von Göring. \nKurt von Schleicher went to the window and thought about it and it all made sense. \nNow that the Kaiser was more or less an unsuspecting puppet of the Junkers, a potential new Reichskanzler only needed the approval of his patrons to take over the office and he knew that von Göring had done massive lobbying in the last few months to gain greater influence. He also knew that the former Statthalter of Mittelafrika was never satisfied with just being Vizekanzler, he wanted more. And as long as  is alive, he never had a chance to become Reichskanzler, so it was only logical that von Göring would have him murdered by a fake 'incident' so he could finally lay his claim to the Kanzlerschaft. \nKurt had to smile, he had actually underestimated Göring's thirst for power. But this tragedy was now over! \nWith his signature he gave the order for the arrest and immediate execution of von Göring and his co-conspirators for high treason against the German Empire."

ger_schleicher.16.t:0 "Hermann von Göring's speech"
ger_schleicher.16.d:0 "Shortly before 3 p.m., Vizekanzler Hermann von Göring was on the way to an emergency session of the Reichstag, where he had to inform the Reichstag and the citizens of the Reich about the 'tragic' death of Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher. \nWhen he entered the Reichstag he saw that the plenary hall and the grandstand were both occupied to the last seat and that everyone was talking excitedly. Everyone awaited the election of a new Reichskanzler and the explanation of the circumstances surrounding the death of Kurt von Schleicher. \nAfter a short address by the Reichstagspräsident, who emphasized the seriousness of the situation, a vote was taken on the appointment of the new Reichskanzler, which von Göring won almost unanimously against the SPD candidate thanks to the support of his party. \nThe Reichstagspräsident gave von Göring the floor and he went to the lectern, the whole hall became quiet and all eyes were only on him. He had waited and worked towards this moment for so long and now it was finally his time to shine. \n'Herr Reichstagspräsident and honorable members of the Reichstag! Today I have the sad duty to inform you and the citizens of our Reich about the circumstances that led to the murder of Kurt von Schleicher! \nFirst the only good news: the police and secret service investigators managed to arrest one of the seven murderers alive, the others were shot while trying to escape. The arrested killer has been interrogated and he has already confessed to the heinous act! \nThe intruders were members of various socialist and syndicalist groups who were verifiably provided with funds and information by agents of the Commune of France in order to carry out the assassination attempt on Herr von Schleicher! \nTo the best of our knowledge, the situation played out as follows: \nThis morning at around 2 a.m., the assassins forcibly gained access to the Reichskanzlers property, first killing his two bodyguards and then breaking into the house. The Chancellor and his wife apparently noticed that the murderers had entered the house and they were able to flee via the balcony through the back garden onto the street, where they have unfortunately been intercepted by other assassins. The police were quickly at the scene after the neighbors reported shots that came from the Schleicher's property. Once there, they were able to shoot six of the seven assassins and arrest one, but the Reichskanzler was hit in the heart while on the run and died at the scene in the arms of his wife Elisabeth, nothing could be done to save him.'"

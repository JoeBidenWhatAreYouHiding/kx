literature.2.t:0 "Diary of a Country Priest - newest Book of Georges Benanos"
literature.2.d:0 "The history of French literature is unique. It is comprised of centuries of great masterpieces, which deliver to the reader ultimate feelings. The newest book, promoted very hard by the Arts' Highest Bureau, is about a Catholic priest who, after new acts on religion are passed after Second Revolution, comes to a village and tries to spread the word of God. Unfortunately, the government has sent a young syndicalist activist to teach the village about the blessings of Marxism, as well. Soon, a love triangle forms between the priest, the agitator and the daughter of a wealthy Kulak. The story ends on a happy note, as the priest loses his faith and becomes a mechanic, and the agitator and the girl start new happy life together with Marx. Critics from non-syndicalist countries say that this is an utter piece of propaganda and that the story it tells is rubbish, however, the common folk of Syndie France are taking quite a liking to it."

literature.3.t:0 "Claude Lévi-Strauss - what to do with him?"
literature.3.d:0 "Claude Lévi-Strauss is an internationally famous philosopher, antrophologist and ethnologist. He has brought out his genius and insightful studies on Beduin tribes, which were banned by National France censorship but they were smuggled to Italy and the Ottoman Empire, where they were translated into many languages. He gained enormous fame as new young scientist, however, the government of National France treats him unfavourably. He was in prison for two years in 1933 and 1935 for producing anti-government literature due to his pro-socialist views. Now he wants to emigrate elsewhere. Our secret services suspect that he wants to flee to the Commune of France. What we should do with him?"

literature.3.b:0 "Let him go, he won't do anything against us!"

literature.4.t:0 "Lévi-Strauss is free!"
literature.4.d:0 "The famous socialist antrophologist Lévi-Strauss is free from militaristic French tyranny. We should invite him so he can live the Communard dream, free from the French reactionaries."

literature.4.b:0 "That would be too much trouble."

literature.5.t:0 "Lévi-Strauss returns to Mainland!"
literature.5.d:0 "One of the greatest minds of this century decided to live in the Commune of France. He stated that the Commune holds legacy of the French revolutionary ideals and the French state in North Africa is the bastardized version of those ideals. Algiers has lost another great writer."
literature.5.a:0 "Welcome home, comrade!"

literature.6.t:0 "Lévi-Strauss flees to the Commune of France"
literature.6.d:0 "The foul rat, Lévi-Strauss, has decided to flee to the Commune of France! We could've imprisoned him, the world would've been better off with one less Marxist."

literature.10.t:0 "Sartre explains his philosophical Stance in his newest Book"
literature.10.d:0 "In his newest book, 'Existentialism and Humanism', Sartre explains the doctrine of Existentialism. For him, one of the key points is that the existence of a person comes before his or her essence. In simple terms, this means that, although a person exists, there is nothing to dictate that person's character, goals in life, and so on. Only the person themselves can define their essence."
literature.10.a:0 "Great, however I don't understand this."

literature.11.t:0 "Sartre has written a Book about the War in Algeria"
literature.11.d:0 "Just when Socialist troops entered Algiers, the capital of National France, Sartre published his views on liberating the natives of former French colonies. In the book he genuinely says that the pieds-noirs should come back to mainland France and leave Algieria for the Algierians who are second class citizens in their own homeland. This book is extremely popular and it seems that the government will distribute it to commissars."
literature.11.a:0 "For the liberation of Africa!"

literature.12.t:0 "'Little Marin and the Sailor' - Newest Book on Japan's Shelves"
literature.12.d:0 "Our country's recent war has inspired many home comers to express their experiences in art, one of them being the author of a romance novel of unprecedented sales numbers.\n\nThe book, bearing the title "Marin-chan to Kaigun-kun", or "Little Marin and the Sailor", tells a story of two childhood friends and their tragic love: a boy and a girl growing up close to each other, partaking in a seemingly unchanging life. However, just when they finish high school, Japan is readying herself for war, and the boy is called to join the Navy. The two have to part from each other, Marin staying at home. Only now that they're separated, they notice their feelings for each other, but struggle to express them in the few letters they can exchange. Just when the war draws to a close, and Marin yearns for her loved one's return, his letters stop coming.\n\nWhile the book does not represent the highest of Japanese literature, it gives an astonishingly detailed insight to both the daily lives of a farmer's daughter in rural Japan and of a Japanese Navy Marine. The book is scheduled to be translated to German, English and Russian."
literature.12.a:0 "Tell me, how does it end?"

literature.14.t:0 "Auf den Marmorklippen, A Book by Ernst Jünger."
literature.14.d:0 "Ernst Jünger, one of our accomplished generals, is also a successful author. Today his newest book came out in the homeland: Auf den Marmorklippen, on the Marble Cliffs. It's a novel full of sometimes obscure symbolism, magic and the inner, hidden workings of life itself. Set in a fantasy world, the rich, art-loving civilisation of Marina is living in peace next to the martial nomads of the steppes. Two brothers are the protagonists of the story who try to stop the Oberförster, the Chief Ranger, from slowly overtaking the beautiful town of Marina. More and more nomads are listening to the Oberförster, who acts jovial it first, but soon proves to be a cold, power-hungry murderer. The people of Marina are stopping to listen to their poets, their values and spirit decay. When the two brothers find a cabin in the woods where the Oberförster's henchmen murder their victims, they try to rise up against the villain, but to no avail. Only their magic allows them to escape. They have to set fire to their house on the cliffs of marble and their life's work watching the city of Marina burn on the horizon, returning to a state of fatalism.The book has gained mixed reviews. While some praise it for it's elaborate aesthetics and the insight in the way the world works, some readers more interested in the political implications of the Marmorklippen are wondering if it is supposed to be Ernst Jünger's commentary on the harsh reality of Mittelafrikan politics. Jünger himself didn't comment on it, but his brother Friedrich Georg, a poet, said that \"it's a shoe that fits various feet\"."

literature.15.t:0 "The Blue Lotus"
literature.15.d:0 "The newest comic of Georges Rémi, or Hergé, takes place in the Qing Empire where the reporter Tintin is sent to dismantle drug trafficking. It is known that Hergé was helped in his work by a young student from the legation city of Shanghai named Zhang Chongren who came to [BEL.GetName] to study fine arts. The expertise of Zhang led to a striking and realistic representation of Chinese society and contributed greatly to the enormous success of the book both in Europe and China. The book criticises the weakness and the corruption of the Qing government as well as the Japanese presence in Manchuria and is as such, banned in both of these countries. Fortunately the Kaiserreich allows free speech, it would have been a shame to miss this work of art!"

literature.17.t: "White Sun over China"
literature.17.d.chi: "The people in Longyan were surprised when a young American man appeared and walked around the capital of our revolution, asking the locals questions about life here and our struggle.\n\nWhile his inquisitive behaviour seemed completely spontaneous and drew a lot of equally curious stares and wild gossip, it was actually the result of the hard work of our publicity department. The foreigner in question is Edgar Snow, an American journalist based in Shanghai, who came to Longyan to be the first Western writer to see our principles in practice first hand. With the help from our experienced scouts, he got safely across the frontlines. He spent his time here doing interviews with leadership figures, including Madame Sun and Wang Jingwei, but also with ordinary soldiers and common people on the streets. He was already quite sympathetic to our cause, and we made sure for him to see that our fight is just.\n\nToday his book hit the stores in the West and is already lauded by some as the scoop of the century. It will surely have a positive effect on our image in the eyes of the people of the world, despite whatever mean-spirited naysayers or apologists of imperialism may crow about bias."
literature.17.d.other: "It has been more than two months since the League of Eight Provinces ceased to exist and war broke out on the shores of the Yangtze River. With chaos reigning in Eastern China, reliable news have been harder to obtain than ever before. Despite the censorship implemented by the warlords and the Qing government, a young journalist made his way with cleverness and courage through the war-torn lands of the former League to the south, to the mountains of the Fujian Base Area of the Kuomintang. Edgar Snow, who came to Shanghai in 1928 from the US, works for an English newspaper in the city. His bravery to cross the frontlines and open sympathy to the cause of the KMT has opened his way to interview the leadership of the uprising. Today his hastily printed book, "White Sun over China", hit the stores and found great interest with Western readership. Besides the talks with his interview partners, he paints a vivid picture of life in the KMT-controlled parts of China, different from warlord rule, but not without strife. His stories, while clearly picking a side, still invoke sympathy for the KMT struggle all over the world, especially in leftist circles."

literature.17.b: "Quite an adventure."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_GOLDWATER_DESC:0 "Born in 1909, in Pheonix, Barry Goldwater has been many things; a College dropout, a department store clerk, an air officer in the Western command center, and now: the savior of Arizona. A longtime friend of President Hoover, when the Civil War began Goldwater nevertheless stayed loyal to DC, enlisting in the federal command center in the Rockies. When the Western command collapsed and surrendered his homeland to the Mexicans, he left in disgust, joining the many southerners who were returning home to continue the fight. For a time he hid among the Natives, gathering allies and offering them greater autonomy and a wide array of concessions if they would aid his efforts to free Arizona. Now that Arizona has risen up in revolt 'The man of Gold and water' as the Mexicans called him, has returned to lead the rebellion. Bringing his loose alliance of Texans, Mormons, Arizonans, and Natives into direct conflict with the occupiers. Goldwater has resolved to see Arizona freed from foreign occupation, free to make its own choices, and there is no length he won't go to see that become a reality."

arizona.1.t:0 "The Status of Goldwater's Revolt"
arizona.1.d:0 "When the Mexicans crossed the Mountains to the south, crushed the remains of the Western command centre and installed garrisons in their occupied territories they must have assumed they were here to stay. When bandit groups began harassing Mexican supply convoys they sent more troops into the cities, when a former National guard Armory was raided they increased their efforts to round up Anglo dissidents. For a time Arizona fell silent with the Occupation forces assuming that Arizona was pacified, the Mexicans pulled forces out of Pheonix and Tucson to reinforce the pacification efforts across the other south western states. \n\nTo former WCC officer and Current leader of a notorious bandit group Barry Goldwater this is a prime opportunity, using his near mythological status among the Mexican army as 'The man of gold and water' to bring together the Arizona rangers, WCC and National guard Remnants and even a sizable force of Natives from the Navajo nation, forging them into the South West Liberation Front, an army worthy of the state of Arizona. With fires staring all across the Mexican occupied territories and the forces of the SWLF infiltrating key cities across the state there has never been a better time to free Arizona from the shackles of the perfidious Mexican"
arizona.1.a:0 "To Arms!"

arizona.2.t:0 "Peace"
arizona.2.d:0 "All over Arizona the guns are beginning to fall silent, with the Mexican army retreating over the Patagonia Mountains and along Interstate 19 its beginning to look like Goldwater's revolt has succeeded, though there are still Mexican holdouts close to the borders, with their supply lines cut and their collaborators being rounded up for deportation they aren't expected to last much longer. With the SWLF Provisional government establishing control across the state and beginning reconstruction efforts people are beginning to expect a return to normalcy and democracy. Goldwater has so far continued the SWLF provisional government and with his growing status as a war hero and liberator some are beginning to worry what will happen when the Emergency government is no longer needed"
arizona.2.a:0 "Freedom, at last. Right?"

arizona.3.t:0 "Restoration of Democracy?"
arizona.3.d:0 "With the formal ceasefire between the Provisional government and Mexico there has been a drastic increase in calls to end the state of Emergency and hold democratic elections, with the loudest of voices coming from the Former state senator Robert Taylor Jones, who helped fund Goldwater's rebellion with his vast wealth gathered through pharmaceuticals, Jones insists that the only way an Arizona government can be legitimate is if power is returned to the state legislature and a Governor is elected. A Clique of Hardline officers within the SWLF However have proposed an alterative solution, to extend the state of Emergency and expand Goldwater's powers to ensure that never again will Mexican boots stomp over Arizona's freedom, while Goldwater is aware that the Mexicans are still in the south, waiting for the perfect time to strike once more he also knows that this decision would be received very poorly by the State Legislature, furthermore he knows that the South west liberation front is made up of many different groups, some of which have openly supported the restoration of Democracy, were the state of emergency to be extended it seems likely there would be resistance, on the Other hand, if this newly democratic government was too weak to resist the Mexican beast all of his work would have been for nothing.

arizona.4.t:0 "Goldwater Consolidates Power"
arizona.4.d:0 "It was early in the morning when the Raids began, all across Pheonix the most prominent faces of the growing democratic movement were being arrested, with a gun battle breaking out on the steps of the State capital building between Militias loyal to the State senate and National guard forces loyal to Goldwater. By midday the story had been spread to every corner of the State with the Broadcast of Barry Goldwater's speech. According to SWLF intelligence agents, Robert Taylor Jones and several members of the state Legislature and fringe members of the SWLF had been potting to assassinate Goldwater and seize command of the Provisional Government in response to Goldwater's short term extension of the state of emergency, they intended to sell Arizona back to the Mexicans in return for wealth and political appointments in their new regime. Unharmed though shaken by the Experience, Goldwater announced that he has no choice but to extend his emergency powers indefinitely, citing the continued interference of Mexico on Arizonan safety, furthermore the SWLF will be reorganised into the First Arizona Army"
arizona.4.a:0 "Long Live Goldwater!"

arizona.5.t:0 "Elections to be Held"
arizona.5.d:0 "With civilian rule restored to Arizona the political machine has started up again, though dozens of fringe parties have sprouted from the chaos of the Mexican occupation and American civil war it appears as if the most prominent will be the Establishment parties, with Robert Taylor Jones, focusing on his plans to expand the railways all across Arizona turning to his old allies in the Democratic Party for their nomination and support, and War hero Barry Goldwater who has aligned with the Republican party with his promise to Desegrate the state and present a hardline policy against Mexican aggression in the south. Some have begun to question just how closely the establishment parties will cooperate with their Equivalents in the Wider American sphere, but it seems for now that that decision will be left in the hands of the President of Arizona."

Though the mood in Pheonix is tense the SWLF has been deployed to ensure that the more violent members of the opposing sides don't cause trouble, and so far violence has been prevented from breaking out. All that's left now is for the people to decide who they want to become the first president of a free Arizona Republic"

arizona.7.t:0 "The Rangers Ride Again"
arizona.7.d:0 "During Goldwater's rebellion there was a small band of Riders who adopted the name of the old Arizona Rangers. They rode through smaller villages the SWLF was too busy to clear, riding from Yuma to Bisbee and forcing the Mexicans out of their occupied border towns. Though never officially recognized as Rangers during the war; there is growing need for a quick response unit within the Arizonan military, now that the war has come to a close. We never know when the perfidious Mexicans will attempt to cross the border once again and with the government's obsession with national security perhaps a small, well-trained and flexible task force of Riders is exactly what is needed; Soldiers on horseback will be able to navigate trails that tanks and troop transports will never be able to cross.\n\Though in the past rangers numbered no more than 30 at any given time, that simply won't be enough for the scale of threat we're facing. The New Arizona Rangers will be Scaled to 200 active members at any given time, though there will be candidates constantly being considered. We already have a spot picked out to house and train them; Fort Huachuca, a mere 30 miles away from the Old Rangers outpost in Naco; From this fortified position they will patrol the Arizonan wildlands like the Heroes of old."
arizona.7.a:0 "Something old meets something New"

arizona.8.t:0 "New Rangers, Old Faces"
arizona.8.d:0 "As news of the Reformation of the Arizona Rangers began to spread across America, it seemed likely that a few old Veterans would return, if only to see if these 'New Rangers' were worthy of the name. What no one could expect however; was the return of Thomas H. Rynning; Former captain of the Rangers, Rough rider, and Veteran of the Spanish-American War. Rynning had long since left Arizona for retirement in California, but when the old Rider heard that the Rangers were being recommissioned, he felt he had no choice but to make the trek.\n\nAfter examining the new Rangers he has put forward his offer to the government; he would return to duty at the Ranger HQ in Sierra Vista, acting as an Instructor as well as an advisor to the newly formed Arizona government; at 70s, the old Cowboy is not as sharp as he once was; but his experience patrolling the Mexican border would be invaluable, perhaps it would be wise to take advice from an Old man in a profession where men often die young." 
arizona.8.a:0 "An American hero returns to service" 

arizona.9.t:0 "Total Libertarianism Without Compromise"
arizona.9.d:0 "With no apparatus of state or red tape to stop him now, President Goldwater was now free to enact his full and total Libertarian dream under his authoritarian gaze. Decriminalizing and legalizing nearly all so-called ‘sins’, ‘vices’, and other hedonistic pleasures. Goldwater has moved to transform Arizona into a boundless and truly Liberal paradise where all are free to live how they so choose - so long as they do not interfere with the rights and lives of other citizens. With gambling, marijuana, home alcohol brewing, homosexuality, gun-ownership, and so much more finally being free and legal for all citizens over the age of 16, our newly independent republic as become a new paradise of true American freedom. Furthermore, democratic freedoms have been expanded, with local government becoming far more dominant - though still wholly subservient to Goldwater’s final, though rare, authority, and enlightened rights such as for religion, speech, assembly and more have all been solidified into unchangeable law. Arizona is a new land of Libertarian utopia and freedom, kept in check by the occasional final word from our beloved President Goldwater and his loyal Arizona Rangers. "
arizona.9.a:0 "A truly free and liberal paradise if ever there was one."

arizona.10.t:0 "Unlikely Allies"
arizona.10.d:0 "Although many of the local Navajo in the area aligned with the Mexicans during our revolt after citing the better treatment they had under their government than under the Americans, a large group of loyalists committed to the Great Navajo Nation and to Chief Chee Dodge were able to hash out a deal with ‘The Man of Gold and Water’ and his allies. Promising greater autonomy and liberties for the Navajo and their partnered tribes that would resemble near-complete freedom and sovereignty for their people within our borders, Goldwater was able to get Chee Dodge and his clique to lend a hand in expelling the Mexican invaders. With Navajo braves and scouts working in unison with the Arizona Rangers, we were able to free our state from the Mexicans and declare an independent republic. Now, with the war over and our independence secured, it has come time to make good on these promises. Keeping his promises, Goldwater has moved to grant near-total independence to the Navajo within our borders, with our two states being more like partners and allies than one central state. Hopefully this new arrangement will work to both of our benefits."
arizona.10.a:0 "We shall work together while maintaining our own separate freedoms."

arizona.11.t:0 "The Guns of Liberty" 
arizona.11.d:0 "When we put out our call for loyal patriots to share their firearms with the SWLF; we expected to receive antiquated Weapons, we were satisfied when Old men brought their old Winchester rifles and Colt Peacemakers. Former state marshals brought out stashed M1918 Browning's and retired police officers arrived at the gathering points with their 'Official police' revolvers. However there has been an unexpected consequence of our call to arms, an Elderly man on horseback hauled it into town one morning, unlimbered it from his horse and offered it to SWLF recruiting officers. After a moment the men realised they were looking at an 6 Pounder field gun, polished like the day it was made. The man claimed that his father had returned from the Mexico-American war with the Artillery piece and that he had been maintaining it for almost 100 years, for a situation just like this. The Recruiters, dumbstruck by the story accepted the cannon on behalf of the Rebellion. Surely an artillery piece which is so old has no place on the battlefield, but it seems foolish to waste such a monument to American victory."

arizona.11.a:0 "Refit and Ship it to the front!" 

arizona.12.t:0 "Arizona Rules the Waves!"
arizona.12.d:0 "Though war with Mexico may be over we can't breathe easy just yet; though we have men patrolling the border that doesn't mean we are secure. A landlocked state, Arizona has historically never required a navy to defend itself; but with the Mexicans intent on destroying us forever we have begun to see the unprotected Colorado river as an undefended front, using the Colorado they could sail up the coastline, attack wherever they desired and retreat to their ships before we could respond. To this end [Root.GetLeader] has authorised the seizure of several mothballed ferry boats, loaded them with cannons and placed former state Legislator and river boat captain Nellie T. Bush in command, giving her the title of the 'Admiral of Arizona's Navy'. Though not a formidable force, and surely no match for Mexican warships; the Navy will ensure that the flag of Arizona flies high over the Colorado and that Mexican bandit forces stay on their side of the water."
arizona.12.a:0 "We love Arizonan Seamen!" 

arizona.13.t:0 "An Arizona Constitution"
arizona.13.d:0 "When Arizona was preparing to join the Union in 1911, we naturally called a convention to discuss what would be included in the state Constitution. Now that Arizona has gained its freedom of the Mexican occupier, it seems only logical that the Senate and legislature should come together and draft a new Arizona Constitution, one that truly represents the hopes and dreams of our new Independent nation. An arduous and complex task like that has left us searching for someone qualified for the job, though talented, [Root.GetLeader] is no political mastermind and has seen fit to delegate to someone much more prestigious. The man chosen to carry out this task was none other than Henry Ashurst, the man who oversaw the creation of the first Arizonan constitution and, when Arizona was truly brought into the Union; Arizona's first senator. Theoretically aligned with Goldwater along Democratic lines, Ashurst defies political classification and has expressed a willingness to work with both sides to ensure a legal and fair constitution. We would be hard pressed to find a candidate more qualified to oversee the creation of our constitution in such a political climate, and Ashurst's middle of the road mode of thinking will ensure that neither side boycotts the convention."

arizona.14.d:0 "Seeking to establish friendly relations between our two newly independent states, the Free City of New York and the Free State of Arizona have begun to establish economic ties, trade deals, and business connections so that both our infantile states may survive in the new wild west that has consumed the New World. With new firearms and construction contracts being established, much of the new projects have been mundane, but one has livened up life for the masses in both nations. Dubbed ‘AriZona Beverages NYC’, this new merger between New York breweries and Arizona farm fields has been able to create a tasty, sugary new concoction that is sweeping the nation. Sold at less than a quarter a bottle, AriZona iced tea and its various other flavors such as the popular Iced Tea-Lemonade flavor named ‘Goldwater’ after the famous Arizonan war hero have become both a hit with the public and a boon for both the economies of Arizona and New York City."
arizona.14.a:0 "Cheers!"

arizona.16.t:0 "Rangers Issue Protest"
arizona.16.d:0 "A letter has been brought forth to the SWLF’s State department, sent directly to the desk of Goldwater as requested by Captain Harry C Wheeler, the leader of the recently reformed Arizona Rangers. The Ranger Captain is voicing concerns about the so far completely unchallenged push for a return to Democracy in Arizona. Citing how subversive elements could turn Goldwater’s generosity against him and corrupt the democratic system, or could rise up against the so far lawful lands of Arizona, utilizing the examples of the Socialists and Longists in the rest of America. Captain Wheeler has thus requested Goldwater think twice about allowing the SWLF to completely give up power without any checks and balances, even pushing forth the idea that perhaps Goldwater should keep power to himself, seeing that he is the one that saved Arizona from the continued pillaging of the Mexicans. \n\nReading this, Goldwater definitely see’s the points of the Ranger Captain, understanding that the mass of the people can easily tread all over the rights of the opposition, as well as fill out posts that only favor their own partisan positions. However at the same time, Goldwater championed republican ideals throughout the revolt against the Mexicans, and he has no wish to go against those promises, even if they are for the best. But with the decision to bring democracy back so close to accomplishment by the SWLF administration, Goldwater must make his choice now. Shall he become that which he fought before in the name of protecting the individual in Arizona?"
arizona.16.a:0 "The Ranger’s warnings shall be heeded"
arizona.16.b:0 "Refuse this call for tyranny"

arizona.17.t:0 "Rangers Attempt Coup"
arizona.17.d:0 "It appears that Goldwater’s responding declination letter to Ranger Captain Wheeler’s suggestion has only since angered him, until finally today it appears that he has made an ambitious play to challenge Goldwater and the SWLF government. The day had gone completely to schedule in the new transition to Democracy, with lines going into public schools and post offices to vote for Jones or Goldwater in the new election. The relative quiet of the day was only interrupted when suddenly the massed sound of hooves beating on the streets sounded across the streets of the capitol as the mounted officers of the Arizona rangers rushed through the streets, most going towards the state legislature while others broke off to the individual polling stations. \n\nThe Rangers that split off to the polling stations rode into the offices and ordered a dispersion of the voters, stating a newly formed state of emergency, all the while forcing the polling assistants to throw out the ballot boxes while chaining the doors to the stations for the night. While at the main State Legislative building of Arizona, the rangers formed a perimeter around the building in expectation of resistance coming from the SWLF bodyguards loyal to Goldwater. However no shots were fired, with the staffers seemingly taken by surprise of this action, yet still the air had the chillingly stiff air of a standoff in the making, as Harry Wheeler marched forth to the steps of the building to make talk with Goldwater, who had also come outside to see what this fuss was about. Informing Goldwater that he had no wish to cause harm to his old friend, but instead was doing these extreme measures for his love of Arizona, that Goldwater was ignoring his warnings of the dangers of democracy while giving the chance of power back to the wolves hiding within the state government, not missing the opportunity to also point out the still as of yet unsolved banditry issue that the Rangers had to combat everyday. \n\nThe attempt to seize power has so far remained bloodless, however the tense air still stands over Phoenix, for the citizenry is not quite pleased with standing by while the rangers push forth their grasp over the state at the capitol. Thus as every hour passes by while Wheeler pleads with Goldwater to give up power in the name of Law and Order, there is a chance of a general uprising by the demobilized fighters of the SWLF militia’s."

arizona.18.t:0 "On the Water and Mineral Rights of the Navajo" 
arizona.18.d:0 "The Navajo and other local Amerindian tribes of our region - such as the Apache, Hopi, Ute, Zuni, Pima, and the various Pueblo peoples - have long been a contentious topic in the American Southwest. The largest reservation in America, the Navajo Nation, lies at the center of Four Corners - where Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah all intersect at an exact point - and other tribal lands dot the rest of our infantile nation. Though many Native Americans aided us in our fight for independence against the Mexicans, many more still aided the Mexicans instead, for our Southern Neighbors have been known to treat the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas far better than we Americans have in recent decades. As such, the atmosphere has grown tense between the Anglo Arizonans and our Native neighbors, and things have only begun to get worse. \n\nThe long standing issue of the Native Americans’ mineral and water rights have come up once again now that Arizona is a free state. The Navajo have long been distrustful of the Americans, and have been one of the most resistant Indigneous groups against American expansion, refusing many treaties and deals in the past. The issue that now plagues us is that the Navajo Nation sits on a large amount of mineral wealth, for their land is full of valuable ore like coal and uranium, as well as oil and other bounties of the Earth. Paired with this issue are their water rights, which particularly affect the Pima and Pueblo peoples of the desert regions of this arid land. There exists large natural water reservoirs and aquifers underground through tribal lands, but these reservoirs have long been tapped and siphoned by American communities. The Amerindian terms are simple: they wish to maintain their sovereign mineral and water rights, and are not willing to negotiate on it. In return, they will integrate into our state as voting citizens, though most will likely keep to their tribal lands. This would give us partial access to their mineral and water wealth, but deny us the full slice of the pie. We could revoke these special rights instead, getting the full bounty of the land, but likely incurring their wrath once more. What should we decide?"

arizona.19.t:0 "The Fourth Navajo War Sparks to Light"
arizona.19.d:0 "Furious over our decision that will deny them of their water and mineral rights, the Navajo and their Indigenous allies have banded together in a council fire coalition of Southwestern tribes under the command of the Tribal Chairman of the Navajo Nation Chee Dodge. In a warparty including the Apache, the Hopi, the Pima, the Pueblo peoples, the Ute, the Zuni, the Hopi, and even the few Comanche that live in Western New Mexico, these Amerindian freedom fighters have taken up arms against European colonizers for the fourth major time in their history. The revolt has been quickly dubbed by international onlookers as the Fourth Navajo War, and both sides now prepare for all-out war only months after first gaining our independence. First against the Spanish, then against the Mexicans, third against the Americans, and now against the Arizonans, history has come knocking once again, for the Navajo have let loose the Anaa’ji warcry, and all shall soon know the wrath of the Red Man."

Though Chee Dodge, Ira Hayes, and the unity coalition of Southwestern Tribes put up a strong fight, they were no match for our supreme tactics and technology, nor could their braves stand up to the might of our proud Rangers. With the peace treaty being penned, we must decide our terms, though we are free to demand what we please due to their inability to strongarm any future negotiation. We can either grant amnesty to their leaders and warriors as we integrate their lands, and leave them with token amounts of autonomy to appease their traditions. Alternatively, we could forgo all respect for these savages, and move to annihilate their autonomy and their identity. They shall be considered Arizonans, or they will forgo their right to live on these lands. To be harsh would ensure us the full bounty of their land, but would also cause great unrest for sometime. Perhaps it would be wiser to ensure some minor autonomy to keep internal stability. What shall we decide?"

arizona.21.t:0 "The Last Great Mountain Man"
arizona.21.d:0 "An American legend has passed from this life; Benjamin Vernon Lilly: Wildman, Spiritualist and veteran of the Arizona independence war, has been found dead. At the age of 84 he remained a strong and fierce hunter, passing through the Arizona territories; when fighting broke out, he lent his considerable trekking experience to the SWLF as a scout. When asked why he gave up his hunting mission to aid the revolution he claimed that ‘Anyone can hunt a bear, it takes a man to hunt a Mexican’, when peace talks with the Mexican government ended he retired to the Green-Lee mountain range, where he was found by several members of the Newly reformed Arizona rangers, wishing to pay their respects. A curious man, Lilly; Ill-at ease with ‘civilized’ life chose to live in the wilds living off of what he could hunt and trap; once claiming that ‘Property is a handicap to man’ he preferred to live a severely threadbare life, when he died he possessed only a thick Bearskin-bound Bible, dried Cougar meat, an axe, his self made ‘Lilly knife’, a Model 1886 Winchester and various animal talismans. An ardent Christian, Lilly claimed to be on a mission from God to rid America of evil beasts; so seriously did he take his duty that he refused to hunt on Sundays, abstained from all alcohol and did not smoke.

arizona.22.d:0 "President Jones has often outspoken about putting an end to the bootleg pharmaceutical trade, being personally involved in the legal creation and distribution of Medicines; there is no one better suited to putting an end to the rampant supply of unlicensed and unverified medicines filling the market. Under Mexican occupation, the trade of unchecked medical supplies skyrocketed as Mexican officers struggled to maintain their addictions and vices. With the invaders being forced out, these lecherous elements escaped the focus of the reformed government, for a time. However, with the deaths of various prominent SWLF officers being connected to an unknown blue crystalline substance flooding the market, it is clear that, for the protection of the people of Arizona something must be done. To that end, President Jones has signed a bill to create a branch of law enforcement specially trained to fight the Narcotics trade known as the ‘Drug Enforcement Agency’; these agents will have wide reaching powers of search and arrest allowing for them to carry out their duty unhindered by government restriction. Of course, this will clear up market space for more legitimate business to expand, legitimate business which may be connected to the President."

Texas Red at just the age of 24 was wanted for dozens of robberies across Texas and the murder of 20 lawmen who had tried to apprehend him and had been hiding out in the town. According to witnesses the unnamed Arizona Ranger, who had a notably large weapon, had come into town to finally bring Texas Red to justice. He asked around for Red’s whereabouts before being approached by Red himself who challenged him to a duel and the Ranger accepted. At 11:20 the two walked their 10 paces before turning and drawing on eachother. Before Texas Red could fire however the Ranger’s gun was already smoking and a bullet had lodged itself in Texas Red’s chest. With his task done the unnamed Ranger left town without a word."

arizona.24.d:0 "Today news has broken that outraged all of Arizona and even the world. In Bisbee, Arizona the local copper mine had been shut down for some time due to a mass of striking workers. To end the strike Phelps Dodge, the company that ran the mine, had presented a list of ‘subversives’ and their supporters to Harry Wheeler, the head of the reformed Arizona Rangers. The list of 1300 names not only included miners but also their families. Wheeler then deputized a posse, likened by local press to more of a mob or army, of 2000 bystanders and at 6:30 in the morning the ‘deputies’ rapidly moved through town arresting those on their lists. The newly minted prisoners were then loaded into cattle cars and taken to the border where they were then dumped in the middle of a desert and told under no uncertain terms never to return to Bisbee. Phelps Dodge tried to keep the story suppressed by cutting communication in the town but as the deportees arrived at a nearby settlement, word spread quickly. Already the deportees are being given temporary housing and letters of the strongest condemnation are pouring into Phoenix. The President has stressed that this crime was a local matter but pledged to open an investigation into the Rangers, into Phelps Dodge and the incident itself. In their defense Dodge has denounced the deportees as ‘Syndicalist Revolutionaries’ and claimed without presenting evidence of a plot to overthrow the Arizona government."

After the failure of the mines in the 1880s and the movement of government officers to Bisbee in 1910 the city, now legendary for its (largely exaggerated) rough and tumble reputation in the Old West had been almost completely abandoned. However with the nation now increasingly harkening back to the Wild West a renewed interest in the time has seemingly breathed new life in the old ghost. Of particular interest is the Gunfight at the OK Corral. There legendary gunslingers Wyatt, Morgan and Virgil Earp teamed up with Doc Holiday to fight a band of outlaws called The Cowboys. Brought into the popular consciousness by the 1931 biography of Wyatt Earp titled Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal the Gunfight has come to symbolize the lawlessness that saturates the public knowledge of the Old West. In a bid to both reconnect the nation with its valued history and to encourage tourism revenue the government has decided to turn Tombstone into a ‘Living History Exhibit’. While the town itself will remain as is, a section of it will be rebuilt to look as it did in the 1880s when the gunfight took place. Actors will be paid to live in the town for part or full time and will teach visitors about life in the Old West with a reenactment of the gunfight occurring every day with various allowances of audience participation. Excitement for the project has electrified the area and already tickets to the Tombstone Town have been sold out in advance."

Despite Goldwater promising that his use of emergency powers are only a temporary measure as Arizona transitions to a more lasting and stable state of independence, these varied Leftists believe this is simply the government’s excuse to hide their true intentions of total societal change as dictated by Goldwater alone. Fearing this existence of total state tyranny, and still infuriated over the actions of the Arizona Rangers during the Bisbee Deportation incident, these agitators have begun to band together under the banner of the PLM-IWW - an international coalition of the Anarcho-Communist-aligned Partido Liberal Mexicano and the Anarcho-Syndicalist-aligned Industrial Workers of the World made up of Mexicans, Americans, and Indigenous citizens united behind their Anarchist and Agrarian vision of an Arizona free of the State. \n\nAlthough we could likely appease these Mexican-American farmers, ranchers, and writers with a few token reforms and concessions aimed at improving the rights and working conditions of workers throughout the state while also granting them small amounts of communal autonomy, most of the hardliners and conservatives within our government demand a hardline stance.

Though a few Bill of Rights fundamentalists still defend the right to bear arms for these angry radicals, most with common sense have begun to demand that Goldwater take immediate action against these Leftists as they round up more support for their cause through mass action, literary pandering, and propaganda of the deed.

Hellbent on tearing down the state in order to create a communalist paradise built along Anarcho-Syndicalist and Anarcho-Communist principles based on the ideas of the French Jacobins, the American Wobblies in the IWW, and the Magon Brothers, Dorame and Palomares will not rest until the proletariat of Arizona are free and prosperous within a Socialist utopia."

If Fernando Palomares is made the face of the coalition, it can be suspected that the Magonist-Jacobin faction more dedicated to Anarcho-Communism would dominate while if Rosendo Dorame is made leader, it can be assumed that the Anarcho-Syndicalist faction would rise to dominance instead. Dorame is more of an academic theorist that dictates the ways of the Revolution from on high while Palomares prefers to get his hands dirty and help spread the Revolution himself through propaganda of the deed, but both are experienced literary masters and both are dedicated to our syncretic Anarchist ideal. However, we could instead continue to stand behind the faceless workers’ congress of the PLM-IWW, staying totally loyal to the demands of our democratic anarchist communes over the vision and plan of any singular leader.

As a whole, our initial reforms are going well despite some growing pains, and we have even been able to quell any animosity with the local indigenous populations by returning water rights and mineral rights of native lands to native hands. Groups like the Navajo and Pima now control their own destinies and natural bounties via collective ownership, appeasing their leaders and introducing them to modern Anarchist principles while allowing us to grow more friendly with them.

Rodeo, horsesports, cattlesports, bull fighting, hog wrestling, and so much more are to be popularized throughout the nation as a new breed of music created by our Mexican citizens called Ranchera shall melodically move the masses towards Cowboy Anarchism. Our state and county fairs will spread this tradition to the masses during times of celebration, and our communities will spread it during times of work on the ranches and in the fields, and we will receive help from our Zapatisa allies as we create new ejidos across the fertile frontier.

The Anarcho-Syndicalists, biased to supporting their unions, argue that the individual communes, unions, ejidos, ranches, and other anarchist communities and organizations that make up our new society should be able to elect their own ministers from among their own people, while the Anarcho-Communists argue that the Party itself should unbiasedly determine the ministers themselves, likely clinging on to minor ideas of Vanguardism.

arizona.64.d:0 "The Democratic party which had once been dominant in Arizona before the Civil War and War for Independence, has at last managed to reorganize themselves in time to be on the ballot for our state’s reintroduced elections. The nation's DNC have come together to nominate their choice, and it has proved to be a fairly contentious race, as the Republican choice of war hero Barry Goldwater has resulted in an uphill battle for our otherwise confident party. We have two candidates that have emerged for the upcoming final round of voting, both with a fiery rhetoric of their own that can give us a chance in the election.\n\nThe first and expected frontrunner in terms of delegate support is Robert Taylor Jones. Well known drug store owner,civil engineer and than state senator for two separate counties, the relatively small time Democrat made his mark when during the war with Mexico, he rallied remnants of the Democratic party to keep some semblance of civil governance operating, and was granted the position of temporary Deputy Governor with the state of emergency, serving as the underling to Goldwater when the state’s civil apparatus was still bumbling around. Hoping to forge a strong and lasting national government if he is elected, Jones has been favored by some of the more conservative delegates with his steady policies and strong opposition to Goldwater’s entire platform.\n\nThe underdog candidate running a strong challenge to Jones for the candidacy is Delegate Andrew Jackson Bettwy. Originating from humble beginnings as the efficient mayor of the city of Nogales, Bettwy has eyed the Democratic nominations for many conventions now, and has now directly fought for it with his ‘New Deal’ platform. This platform of strong government intervention in the economy with work projects and employment relief, has appealed to the progressive section of the party, that remember George W.P Hunt’s own progressive lobbying, and see Bettwy as the idol for keeping the legacy of Frontier Progressivism that has dominated the west of America in Arizona. The candidates have had time for their speeches and their own whipping efforts among the delegates, now the DNC must convene for the final vote of the Convention."

arizona.65.d:0 "Arizona’s elevation to its own independent country has meant a shake-up of the government’s view on its affairs and land, ranging from large scale to small time, all areas of business, culture and economy are being viewed with a new light. One such area is parks and monuments, which Arizona is no stranger to with its large share of unique land formations unlike anywhere else in North America. Reclassifying our state monuments and parks into national ones, we have not forgotten one of our most honored ones, that being the tomb where former Governor George W.P Hunt resides with his wife. Commissioned by him and erected as a majestic white pyramid in the radiant Papago Park for his deceased Wife, after his death in 1934 he himself was then laid to rest, now looking over all of Phoenix. The site was already a pilgrimage ground by many who respect Hunt’s progressive legacy -particularly the women of our country who were granted the right to vote by him- it has only further grown in status with the new classification, as many come to see the resting place of Arizona’s very own King George VII, named that due to his seven terms as Governor. This shall be a first in what many hope to be a rich future of Arizona’s national monuments and historical sites."

arizona.66.t:0 "Bettwy Clocks Opposition Reporter"
arizona.66.d:0 "Today a headline of sensationalist drama has appeared across the nation’s newspapers as it appears the Democratic National Convention has gotten physical! After Bettwy’s selection as the nominee of the party, what was to be the quiet wrapping up of the convention, with time slots only being allocated to Bettwy’s victory speech, was interrupted by another delegate rushing the podium during a lull in the conference. This delegate was William Matthews, publisher of the Tucson Daily Star and noted opponent within the Democratic Party of Bettwy’s ‘New Deal’. Matthews spoke for several minutes, droning on about the New Deal’s inability to fit within the Arizonan Budget due to the debt it would invoke, and while the convention allowed him to speak at first, with the expected amount of jeers from the crowd for his unpopular stance, finally it resulted in mass backlash as the speech veered into personal attacks against the inspiration for the New Deal, George Norris and his original Square Deal platform. It seems these attacks against a valued mentor and idol was too much for Andrew Bettwy, as finally he emerged from the convention floor and gave a right hook into the jaw of Matthews. Matthews originally dropped and Bettwy was rushed out of the building by delegates who seeked to prevent the party’s candidate from ruining his reputation, only for Matthews to resume his speech on the podium. Finally, the bizarre interruption came to a close as someone in the crowd finally unplugged the public address system, and all delegates returned to their seats once more. This one-off instance of heated passion turning into an altercation has surprisingly resulted in no love lost in the democratic party, for while the event was an amusing shock, many have already started continuing on with their day to day affairs."

arizona.67.t:0 "The Presidential Divorce"
arizona.67.d:0 "An increasingly negative factor of a politician’s career is the spotlight that gets shown not just on their policy, but also on their conduct of personal life, and it appears that President Andrew Bettwy is increasingly no stranger to this fact. The President’s marriage was often being speculated on throughout his term, and today’s news of a divorce with his wife Mary Bettwy has only further resulted in Media scrambling for any statements and information they can get their hands on. While Andrew was pursuing the top office of President for the Democratic party, his wife Mary was pursuing the more humble office of county recorder for Santa Cruz county, becoming the first Hispanic woman to achieve a government post in the nation. While both endeavors were successful, it appears the stress of each tight race weighed on their relationship at home, and an increasingly different outlook between the two meant that both wished to separate from their previous vow of marriage. It will remain to be seen how this divorce weighs on both of the former couple’s political careers, as Republicans could well attempt to use it as hit-pieces in any race, yet this has not shirked Mary Escalante from her post as County Recorder, with her publicly stating she intends to run for the office for the rest of her life."

ARZ_tackle_courpption_desc:0 "Within the former government of the State of Arizona, there were many vultures. Lawyers and judges who would embezzle funds from the people, and abuse their powers. The Rangers have no love for those who misuse the trust of the people, and thus shall hunt down these carrion birds."
ARZ_finish_banditry:0 "Finish off Banditry"
ARZ_finish_banditry_desc:0 "The insurgency against the Mexican army had resulted in the loss of connection between our vast frontier, and now Bandits are common in the many plains and valleys of Arizona. We must chase down these thugs, Mexican Bandito or even fellow Arizonans turned criminals, they are a poison to our commerce and towns."

ARZ_protected_democracy_desc:0 "The towns and counties of Arizona shall be allowed to continue domestic democracy amongst themselves, albeit under the ever watchful eyes of the Rangers.

ARZ_frontier_spirit_desc:0 "Arizona remains to have the spirit of the Wild West within its heart, for even though it has since been a century since settling, our people continue to tame the Frontiers, pushing into area’s thought unholdable to mankind, while settling down new towns and villages."

ARZ_plmiww_rideout:0 "The PLM-IWW Rides Out"
ARZ_plmiww_rideout_desc:0 "The Partido Liberal Mexicano-Industrial Workers of the World coalition - a syncretic and internationalist Left Libertarian organization led by Mexican-American and Indigenous socialist leaders Rosendro Dorame and Fernando Palomares that fuses the Magonism, Jacobinism, Anarcho-Communism, Agrarianism, and the dedication to Social Democracy of the Mexican Liberal Party with the Anarcho-Syndicalism and Industrial Unionism of the IWW, wrapped in a ‘Cowboy Communalist’ skin that emphasizes the frontiersman lifestyle, environmentalism, rural communitarianism, and decentralized Leftist communalism tied together with a direct democracy and Left Libertarian views of societal freedom under a Socialist night watchmen’s state - has taken control of Arizona in a coup against the libertarian-turned-authoritarian Barry Goldwater. Now, Rosendo Dorame and Fernando Palomares will bring their unique Anarchist revolution to Arizona while attempting to stay true to their syncretic ideas, and while trying to strike a balance between the Syndicalist Wobblies and Communist firebrands that dominate their international coalition of Mexican, American, and Indigenous radicals and farmers."
ARZ_red_rangers:0 "Dye the Rangers Red"
ARZ_red_rangers_desc:0 "The Arizona Rangers must be brought to heel if we are to fully take hold of Arizona. Their leaders like Harry C. Wheeler must be either reeducated if possible or executed if not, and their organization must be infused with our Leftist ideology wholeheartedly as party loyalists flood their ranks and rapidly replace the stubborn, conservative, and even reactionary old guard. Through blood and sweat under the hot sun, the Rangers shall be dyed a deep and loyal crimson no matter the cost so that they can be utilized as the paramilitary and secret police arm of the PLM-IWW."

ARZ_justice_but_real_desc:0 "Rotting away in a prison cell since our coup, Goldwater and the rest of his lackeys must be dealt with. Though there can be no hope for ‘the Man of Golden Water’ and other stubborn leaders of the dying order like Jones and his failed Democratic Party, perhaps the rest of their less-fanatic peons could be of use. Regardless, the proletariat of Arizona will have their justice against the perpetrators of state tyranny!"
ARZ_rural_ranching:0 "Rural Ranching and Fertile Fields"
ARZ_rural_ranching_desc:0 "If we are to win over the masses and spread our Socialist ideology without collapsing, we must show results. Arizona gets its money from its agricultural produce, and as agrarian socialists, this is supposedly our speciality! We must apply our brand of syncretic Anarcho-Syndicalist/Anarcho-Communist communalism and agrarianism in order to build a ranching and farming network that is not only profitable and plentiful, but one that also cares for its workers in all that they require and desire in order to live peaceful, productive, and happy lives."
ARZ_humble_striker:0 "A ‘Regeneracion’ for the Humble Striker"
ARZ_humble_striker_desc:0 "Chief representative of the Syndicalist Wobblies that dominate half the PLM-IWW, Rosendo Dorame has been elected from within the Party to guide the Revolution going forward. A former writer for the PLM party magazine ‘Regeneracion’ back when he worked in Mexico more permanently before his time on the road, Dorame may hold a place in his heart for the PLM in principle, but in practice he has taken fully to the IWW, its Syndicalist message, and its American origins. A knowledgeable writer and theorist in the fields of platformist and organizationalist Anarcho-Syndicalism, Agrarian Socialism, and Industrial Unionism, Dorame may pay lip service to Anarcho-Communist desires but he has fully fallen in with Syndicalist demands. Preferring to work from afar while keeping his own hands clean unlike his partner and close friend Palomares, Dorame will comfortably and peacefully work within the new democratic process and away from the front lines as he creates an Anarcho-Syndicalist workers’ utopia."

ARZ_trail_o_powder_desc:0 "Chief representative of the Magonist-Jacobins and other Anarcho-Communists that dominate a majority of the PLM-IWW, Fernando Palomares has been elected from within the Party to guide the Revolution going forward. Known to call his literary works a ‘trail of powder’ waiting to be ignited with action and public revolutionary deeds so that it may explode and inspire the masses, Palomares practices the Propaganda of the Deed over the simple and safe rhetoric and theory preferred by his good friend Dorame. Implementing his insurrectionist and synthesis Anarchist ideology through his own hands as he personally aids in tearing down the old order when not battling in the Arizona Congress, Palomares leans more into the Anarchism, Communist Agrarianism, and Magonist-Jacobin principles of the group, holding greater ties to Mexico and France over the CSA while putting Syndicalism on the back burner. Though committed to Syndicalism in theory, unionist concerns shall take a back seat as Palomares guides Arizona towards Anarcho-Communism."

ARZ_socialist_and_breedable_desc:0 "Regardless of the leadership dilemma, both Anarcho-Syndicalism and Anarcho-Communism are to be pursued by the state, and so the Party must cooperate and compromise as they figure out how to fuse two opposing forms of Socialism for the common good of the masses. Inspired by the Anarcho-Communism of the Magon brothers of Mexican revolutionary fame, by the democratic Communism of the original French Jacobins, and by the democratic Anarcho-Syndicalism of the modern IWW, our party promotes a strange fusion of ideas aimed at creating a free and prosperous agrarian society not dictated by state tyranny or capitalist greed. By taking the best aspects of these ideologies while cutting off all the fat, we shall hopefully be left with our own unique breed of Anarchism that incorporates Communalism, Unionism, Agrarianism, Vanguardism, and more in order to create a perfect revolutionary society form-fit for the Southwest."
ARZ_red_mesa:0 "Racial Unity Upon the Red Mesa"
ARZ_red_mesa_desc:0 "With Palomares being of Mayo indigenous blood and Dorame of Opata origin, and with both further being both Mexican and American fluent in both English and Spanish along with their own indigenous languages and others, racial unity and total societal egalitarianism is something all in the PLM-IWW can agree on. With this complete agreement easing most would-be obstacles not already eradicated by our violent bid for power, we are free to pursue total de-segregation in Arizona while also pushing for state bilingualism of Spanish and English, total equality between all sexes and races in the nation, and the equal rights of Mexican-American and Indigenous citizens. No longer shall petty things like gender and ethnicity divide us as we come together as one united revolutionary proletariat."

The Hoover Dam and other necessary but wondrous sites like it shall be maintained, updated, and expanded in order to provide more for the people, and additionally they shall be opened up to the public and given a revolutionary makeover in order to sway the masses. Furthermore, we will ensure that the natural wonders and beauties of our state like the Grand Canyon, the Petrified Forest, the Beaver Dam Mountains, the Saguaro Nation Park, and Zion National Park, along with the smaller state parks and other natural sites, are preserved, protected, and maintained so that the public can enjoy and be inspired by untouched nature for generations to come. Through good-natured environmentalism and good ol’ fashioned subtle propaganda and civic good works, we will win over them all with a hearts and minds campaign more effective than any ever before."

A syncretic paradise for all those across the Southwest lookin for a better life, the Wild West has been truly tamed here, but not broken, for the wild spirit of the West and this endless frontier remain guarded and fostered by our crimson revolution as we care for our families and our communities out here on the Range."

ARZ_big_socialist_arz_desc:0 "With our roots in both America and Mexico, the PLM-IWW feels that it has a claim to both nations and their failing revolutionary regimes. Marching out from the American Southwest towards Washington and Mexico City, our coalition seeks to bring our unique and syncretic breed of Anarchism to the New World, so let us carry out the dream of the Magon brothers and Big Bill Haywood as we soldier on for the liberation of North America."

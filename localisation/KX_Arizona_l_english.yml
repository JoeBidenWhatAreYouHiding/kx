### Events ###
arizona.1.t:0 "The Status of Goldwater's Revolt"
arizona.1.d:0 "When the Mexicans crossed the Mountains to the south, crushed the remains of the Western command centre and installed garrisons in their occupied territories they must have assumed they were here to stay. When bandit groups began harassing Mexican supply convoys they sent more troops into the cities, when a former National guard Armory was raided they increased their efforts to round up Anglo dissidents. For a time Arizona fell silent with the Occupation forces assuming that Arizona was pacified, the Mexicans pulled forces out of Pheonix and Tuscon to reinforce the pacification efforts across the other south western states. \n\nTo former WCC officer and Current leader of a notorious bandit group Barry Goldwater this is a prime opportunity, using his near mythological status among the Mexican army as 'The man of gold and water' to bring together the Arizona rangers, WCC and National guard Remnants and even a sizable force of Natives from the Navajo nation, forging them into the South West Liberation Front, an army worthy of the state of Arizona. With fires staring all across the Mexican occupied territories and the forces of the SWLF infiltrating key cities across the state there has never been a better time to free Arizona from the shackles of the perfidious Mexican"
arizona.1.a:0 "To Arms!"

arizona.2.t:0 "Peace"
arizona.2.d:0 "All over Arizona the guns are beginning to fall silent, with the Mexican army retreating over the Patagonia Mountains and along Interstate 19 its beginning to look like Goldwater's revolt has succeeded, though there are still Mexican holdouts close to the borders, with their supply lines cut and their collaborators being rounded up for deportation they aren't expected to last much longer. With the SWLF Provisional government establishing control across the state and beginning reconstruction efforts people are beginning to expect a return to normalcy and democracy. Goldwater has so far continued the SWLF provisional government and with his growing status as a war hero and liberator some are beginning to worry what will happen when the Emergency government is no longer needed"
arizona.2.a:0 "Freedom, at last. Right?"

arizona.3.t:0 "Restoration of Democracy?"
arizona.3.d:0 "With the formal ceasefire between the Provisional government and Mexico there has been a drastic increase in calls to end the state of Emergency and hold democratic elections, with the loudest of voices coming from the Former state senator Robert Taylor Jones, who helped fund Goldwater's rebellion with his vast wealth gathered through pharmaceuticals, Jones insists that the only way an Arizona government can be legitimate is if power is returned to the state legislature and a Governor is elected. A Clique of Hardline officers within the SWLF However have proposed an alterative solution, to extend the state of Emergency and expand Goldwater's powers to ensure that never again will Mexican boots stomp over Arizona's freedom, while Goldwater is aware that the Mexicans are still in the south, waiting for the perfect time to strike once more he also knows that this decision would be received very poorly by the State Legislature, furthermore he knows that the South west liberation front is made up of many different groups, some of which have openly supported the restoration of Democracy, were the state of emergency to be extended it seems likely there would be resistance, on the Other hand, if this newly democratic government was too weak to resist the Mexican beast all of his work would have been for nothing. "
arizona.3.a:0 "So be it, Call Elections"
arizona.3.b:0 "The Mexican threat still looms, Extend the State of Emergency" 

arizona.4.t:0 "Goldwater Consolidates Power"
arizona.4.d:0 "It was early in the morning when the Raids began, all across Pheonix the most prominent faces of the growing democratic movement were being arrested, with a gun battle breaking out on the steps of the State capital building between Militias loyal to the State senate and National guard forces loyal to Goldwater. By midday the story had been spread to every corner of the State with the Broadcast of Barry Goldwater's speech. According to SWLF intelligence agents, Robert Taylor Jones and several members of the state Legislature and fringe members of the SWLF had been potting to assassinate Goldwater and seize command of the Provisional Government in response to Goldwater's short term extension of the state of emergency, they intended to sell Arizona back to the Mexicans in return for wealth and political appointments in their new regime. Unharmed though shaken by the Experience, Goldwater announced that he has no choice but to extend his emergency powers indefinitely, citing the continued interference of Mexico on Arizonan safety, furthermore the SWLF will be reorganised into the First Arizona Army"
arizona.4.a:0 "Long Live Goldwater!"

arizona.5.t:0 "Elections to be Held"
arizona.5.d:0 "With civilian rule restored to Arizona the political machine has started up again, though dozens of fringe parties have sprouted from the chaos of the Mexican occupation and American civil war it appears as if the most prominent will be the Establishment parties, with Robert Taylor Jones, focusing on his plans to expand the railways all across Arizona turning to his old allies in the Democrat party for their nomination and support, and War hero Barry Goldwater who has aligned with the republican party with his promise to Desegrate the state and present a hardline policy against Mexican aggression in the south. Some have begun to question just how closely the establishment parties will cooperate with their Equivalents in the Wider American sphere, but it seems for now that that decision will be left in the hands of the President of Arizona."
arizona.5.a:0 "As it should be"

arizona.6.t:0 "General Election of [GetYear]"
arizona.6.d:0 "The day has finally come, with Patriotic citizens stretching across Arizona coming together to patriciate in the first free and fair election since before the civil war, this election is shaping up to be a successful transition of power out of the Emergency government, though the Campaigns of the two Presidential candidates have been fierce, with Goldwater accusing Jones of cowardice, citing Jones inaction during the rebellion as well as his own status as a war hero, while Jones accused Goldwater of  wanting to echo Macarthur and reminded the public of his vast donations to the reconstruction effort. Though the mood in Pheonix is tense the SWLF has been deployed to ensure that the more violent members of the opposing sides don't cause trouble, and so far violence has been prevented from breaking out. All that's left now is for the people to decide who they want to become the first president of a free Arizona Republic"
arizona.6.a:0 "Goldwater Wins a Smashing Victory!"
arizona.6.b:0 "Robert Taylor Jones claims the Position of President" 

arizona.7.t:0 "The Rangers ride again"
arizona.7.d:0 "During Goldwater's rebellion there was a small band of Riders who adopted the name of the old Arizona Rangers. They rode through smaller villages the SWLF was too busy to clear, riding from Yuma to Bisbee and forcing the Mexicans out of their occupied border towns. Though never officially recognized as Rangers during the war; there is growing need for a quick response unit within the Arizonan military, now that the war has come to a close. We never know when the perfidious Mexicans will attempt to cross the border once again and with the government's obsession with national security perhaps a small, well-trained and flexible task force of Riders is exactly what is needed; Soldiers on horseback will be able to navigate trails that tanks and troop transports will never be able to cross.\n\Though in the past rangers numbered no more than 30 at any given time, that simply won't be enough for the scale of threat we're facing. The New Arizona Rangers will be Scaled to 200 active members at any given time, though there will be candidates constantly being considered. We already have a spot picked out to house and train them; Fort Huachuca, a mere 30 miles away from the Old Rangers outpost in Naco; From this fortified position they will patrol the Arizonan wildlands like the Heroes of old."
arizona.7.a:0 "Something old meets something New"

arizona.8.t:0 "New Rangers, old faces"
arizona.8.d:0 "As news of the Reformation of the Arizona Rangers began to spread across America, it seemed likely that a few old Veterans would return, if only to see if these 'New Rangers' were worthy of the name. What no one could expect however; was the return of Thomas H. Rynning; Former captain of the Rangers, Rough rider, and Veteran of the Spanish-American War. Rynning had long since left Arizona for retirement in California, but when the old Rider heard that the Rangers were being recommissioned, he felt he had no choice but to make the trek.\n\After examining the new Rangers he has put forward his offer to the government; he would return to duty at the Ranger HQ in Sierra Vista, acting as an Instructor as well as an advisor to the newly formed Arizona government; at 70s, the old Cowboy is not as sharp as he once was; but his experience patrolling the Mexican border would be invaluable, perhaps it would be wise to take advice from an Old man in a profession where men often die young." 
arizona.8.a:0 "An American hero returns to service" 

arizona.9.t:0 "Total Libertarianism Without Compromise"
arizona.9.d:0 "With no apparatus of state or red tape to stop him now, President Goldwater was now free to enact his full and total Libertarian dream under his authoritarian gaze. Decriminalizing and legalizing nearly all so-called ‘sins’, ‘vices’, and other hedonistic pleasures. Goldwater has moved to transform Arizona into a boundless and truly Liberal paradise where all are free to live how they so choose - so long as they do not interfere with the rights and lives of other citizens. With gambling, marijuana, home alcohol brewing, homosexuality, gun-ownership, and so much more finally being free and legal for all citizens over the age of 16, our newly independent republic as become a new paradise of true American freedom. Furthermore, democratic freedoms have been expanded, with local government becoming far more dominant - though still wholly subservient to Goldwater’s final, though rare, authority, and enlightened rights such as for religion, speech, assembly and more have all been solidified into unchangeable law. Arizona is a new land of Libertarian utopia and freedom, kept in check by the occasional final word from our beloved President Goldwater and his loyal Arizona Rangers. "
arizona.9.a:0 "A truly free and liberal paradise if ever there was one."

arizona.10.t:0 "Unlikely Allies"
arizona.10.d:0 "Although many of the local Navajo in the area aligned with the Mexicans during our revolt after citing the better treatment they had under their government than under the Americans, a large group of loyalists committed to the Great Navajo Nation and to Chief Chee Dodge were able to hash out a deal with ‘The Man of Gold and Water’ and his allies. Promising greater autonomy and liberties for the Navajo and their partnered tribes that would resemble near-complete freedom and sovereignty for their people within our borders, Goldwater was able to get Chee Dodge and his clique to lend a hand in expelling the Mexican invaders. With Navajo braves and scouts working in unison with the Arizona Rangers, we were able to free our state from the Mexicans and declare an independent republic. Now, with the war over and our independence secured, it has come time to make good on these promises. Keeping his promises, Goldwater has moved to grant near-total independence to the Navajo within our borders, with our two states being more like partners and allies than one central state. Hopefully this new arrangement will work to both of our benefits."
arizona.10.a:0 "We shall work together while maintaining our own separate freedoms."

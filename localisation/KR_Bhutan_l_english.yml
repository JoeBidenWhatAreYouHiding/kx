### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_JIGME_WANGCHUCK_DESC:0 "Ascending to the throne at the age of 21, Druk Gyalpo Jigme Wangchuck quickly proved himself as a capable, though uninteresting, leader. Negotiating Bhutan’s place in the world following instability in both neighbouring Tibet and India, Jigme has managed to retain the status quo in his mountain kingdom, though many would attribute these successes to his Gongzim and ally Sonam Topgye Dorji. With dark clouds brewing on the horizon, there is some question as to whether Jigme can maintain his grip on the young kingdom."
 POLITICS_TSHERING_PENJOR_DESC:0 "A harsh and cruel man, few doubt the effectiveness of Tshering Penjor as Druk Gyalpo. He is a man of contradictions, quick to laugh but quicker to anger, the host of numerous concubines but no wives. None know for certain why the Paro Penlop seized the throne following the death of his liege, whether he felt the need to guide Bhutan as a firm and strong ruler, or simply desired the title promised to him over a decade ago."
 POLITICS_JIGME_DORJI_DESC:0 "The late King Jigme’s eldest son, young Jigme Dorji holds little power aside from his family name. However, his education has taken him outside of the mountain kingdom and began to give him knowledge of the outside world and a desire for reform in his own realm. While the kingdom is currently ruled by his regent Sonam Topgye Dorji, there is little doubt that King Jigme Dorji has great plans for the nation following his ascension."
 POLITICS_JIGME_DORJI_OLD_DESC:0 "Having completely taken power over the nation, young king Jigme Dorji continues to rely on the advice of his Gongzim Sonam Topgye Dorji. However, Jigme Dorji is no puppet, he seeks to totally reform the mountain kingdom along the lines of a modern western nation. Whether or not these reforms will prove to succeed is yet to be seen, but none would question Jigme Dorji’s conviction to the betterment of his kingdom and people."
 POLITICS_ZHABDRUNG_DESC:0 "Zhabdrung Rinpoche Jigme Dorji is a figure clouded in mystery. Some say that he is little better than a bandit, with few morals and no qualms about using violence to further his own goals. Others point to his devotion to Buddhism, though his several illegitimate wives conflict with these claims. Only one thing is entirely clear about the young religious leader, he truly views himself as the reincarnation of the great Ngawang Namgyal, and wishes more than anything to reclaim the ancient power and glory of Bhutan."

### Decisions ###
 BHU_reforms_decision_category:0 "Reforming Bhutan"
 BHU_reforms_decision_category_desc:0 "Bhutan lags far behind most of the nations of the world, with an army made up of barely trained and equipped peasant levies and a pre-industrial economy revolving around subsistence farming and craft workshops. To survive in the modern world, Bhutan will have to reform its feudal structures into something more stable and robust. To do this, Bhutan must deal with three different areas of reform: \nThe first is £legitimacy  Central Authority. This value represents the amount of control the central government of Bhutan is able to exert on the various Penlops, monastic orders, and isolated villages of the kingdom. Raising the authority of the government is key to gaining the resources necessary to enact reforms to the nation. \nThe second is £industry_texticon  Economic Development. This value represents the investments made by the government into the industrial workshops of the country. The more the government invests into the economy, however, the more these investments cost daily political power. In a desperate attempt to raise revenue, one can also lower the amount of investment into the economy, freeing up capital for other projects. \nThe third is £manpower_texticon  Military Investment. This value represents the investments made by the government into arming and training the central army of the country. The more the government invests into the military, however, the more this army costs daily political power. In a desperate attempt to raise revenue, one can also lower the amount of investment into the military, freeing up capital for other projects. \nEach of these values can be £increase_texticon  raised or £decrease_texticon  lowered by a number of different events, focuses, and decisions. Be wise with your investments! A smart ruler knows to centralise the state before they begin to spend frivolously, and to invest in the army before jumping into a conflict. "

### Events ###

 bhutan.0.t:0 "Status of Bhutan"
 bhutan.0.d:0 "Bhutan was always on the periphery of Great Britain’s sphere, and when the empire began to collapse, it remained firmly on the periphery. Following the establishment of a socialist republic in Bengal, Bhutanese statesman Sonam Topgye Dorji managed to negotiate a stable relationship with the Bharatiya Commune. Bhutan withdrew from their traditional claims in the Duars and recognised the Commune as an independent nation, and in return, the new syndicalist government in Calcutta continued the Raj’s pre-revolution economic investment and recognised the sovereignty of Bhutan. With the situation in India heating up, and instability in Bhutan’s close northern neighbour Tibet following the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, the kingdom aims to stand as an island of peace and stability amidst this vast sea of chaos."
 bhutan.0.a:0 "Interesting"

 bhutan.1.t:0 "The Himalayan Powderkeg"
 bhutan.1.d:0 "Since the reign of the great Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, Bhutan has been ruled by the Zhabdrung reincarnations, who delegated temporal power to the Druk Desi, elected by the nobles, or penlops, and the Je Khenpo, elected by the monks. However, over time these two leaders have come to conspire to eliminate the power of the Zhabdrung, and by the nineteenth century, the country was firmly in the hands of the Druk Desi and Je Khenpo. This Diarchy was further streamlined when the Penlop of Trongsa, Ugyen Wangchuck, crushed his rivals and crowned himself a hereditary monarch in 1907. The kingdom saw a brief period of crisis at the death of King Ugyen in 1925, where, amongst the chaos of the Indian Revolution, two claimants, Ugyen’s son Jigme and the Penlop of Paro Tshering Penjor, raced to crown themselves as his successor. With the help of Ugyen’s close political allies, the Dorji Family, Jigme managed to secure the throne and consolidate his power. However, with the power of the Dorji family waning, other political forces have risen to challenge Jigme’s rule. The newest reincarnation of the Zhabdrung has spent the last ten years building a base with which he challenges the king’s authority, and there are many within Bhutan who aim to profit from the king’s weakness."
 bhutan.1.a:0 "So much for an island of stability, huh?"

 bhutan.2.t:0 "The Pretender in Paro"
 bhutan.2.d:0 "To the west of our capital lies Paro, granted to Tshering Penjor by the former King Ugyen, along with promises that Tshering Penjor would rule the kingdom following the late king’s death. Only the haste of Sonam Topgye Dorji in coronating the young prince Jigme Wangchuck prevented him from taking the throne for himself, and the noble has fumed in the west ever since. Tshering Penjor holds a small stockpile of firearms, as well as the late king Ugyen’s Raven Crown. While it is true that Tshering Penjor has served the king faithfully since Jigme beat him to the title, one can only wonder where his true loyalties lie. He has many allies within the more traditionalist penlops and key members of Bhutan’s limited armed forces and serves as a rallying point for those in opposition of the king’s policies. However, with no wives or sons to speak of, it is generally thought that Tshering Penjor will die by the time Jigme’s son, Jigme Dorji, is of age to inherit the traditional seat of heirs to the kingdom at Paro."
 bhutan.2.a:0 "We should keep a close eye on him"

 bhutan.3.t:0 "Sonam Topgye Dorji Returns"
 bhutan.3.d:0 "The king’s primary advisor, the Gongzim Sonam Topgye Dorji, has returned from a mission to the Bharatiya Commune. As the main conduit to the outside world, he brings an assortment of gifts and treasures that he obtained while abroad, including Weltkrieg vintage rifles and various luxury goods. Having presented these gifts to the king, Sonam Topgye immediately set about managing the affairs of the state. As the king’s minister, Sonam Topgye is the foremost ally of the Wangchuck family, and with their children betrothed to one another, it seems that Jigme aims to keep it that way. Though their power was the most disrupted by the Indian Revolution, the Dorji family remain the richest family in Bhutan, and aim to use that wealth for the benefit of the nation and the king, though many of the more conservative elements of Bhutan see their methods of reform to be outlandish and ill-designed."
 bhutan.3.a:0 "What good is a Druk Gyalpo without a good Gongzim?"

 bhutan.4.t:0 "The Zhabdrung Makes His Move"
 bhutan.4.d:0 "After years of planning, it seems that the Zhabdrung is aiming to make some sort of power-play against the king. Rumours are spreading across Bhutan that the brother of the Zhabdrung, Choekyi Gyeltshen, travelled to India to meet with the prominent Agrarian Mohandas Gandhi, pledging the establishment of a socialist theocracy in return for his help. While the Indian leader declined to support this insurrection, further rumours have spread claiming that there is a plot led by the supporters of the Zhabdrung which aims to secretly assassinate King Jigme! Already the leading men of Bhutan have cried out for action, pledging to bring the Zhabdrung and his supporters to justice if these accusations are true."
 bhutan.4.a:0 "That snake!"

 bhutan.5.t:0 "A New Head of the Guard?"
 bhutan.5.d:0 "The position of head of the Royal Guard has remained in the hands of an elder member of the Wangchuck family since long before the coronation of Jigme. With rumours of plots against Jigme, Tshering Penjor has pushed relentlessly for the installation of King Jigme's younger nephew, the noble warrior Chhabda Namgyal Bahadur,  into this post. While the king is wary of introducing a loyal agent of Tshering Penjor in such a powerful position, Namgyal Bahadur is a proven commander and skilled fighter. Famous for breaking two rifles with his bare hands during training with the British, Namgyal Bahadur is known as the man with two spines, renowned for his strength and courage. His help would be invaluable were armed conflict to break out."

 bhutan.5.b:0 "There’s no need for all of these changes!"

 bhutan.6.t:0 "Jigme Addresses the Court"
 bhutan.6.d:0 "With rumours of a Zhabdrung led coup against the king brewing, Jigme has decided to inject a fair bit of normalcy back into Bhutan politics. Bhutan has long since been divided between traditionalists led by Tshering Penjor, and reformers led by Sonam Topgye. By making an address that plays to one of the two sides, Jigme would bring the debate back around from assassinations to tax collection. However, such divisive talk threatens to further split Jigme’s base of support, a base which he needs now more than ever."

 bhutan.8.d:0 "Since his birth in 1929, the son of the king, Jigme Dorji, has lived with his father, being taught the basics of governance, religion, and warfare by Jigme’s closest councillors. With the capital growing more dangerous by the day, Sonam Topgye has offered to take the young heir to India, where he could better his Hindi and enrol in a formal school."
 bhutan.8.a:0 "He’d be safer abroad"

In response to his actions, the king has moved to seize these lands for himself, sending the Royal Guard into the surrounding villages to root out any opposition. While most of the settlements were cooperative, one was harbouring a gang of the Zhabdrung’s bandits, who managed to rout our forces in a surprise attack. This village remains out of our grasp, a base for the Zhabdrung’s marauders."

Tshering Penjor has requested that he be given the honour of leading the combined armies as he is a more experienced commander than King Jigme. Tshering Penjor’s martial ability would be an asset in the conflict to come, but many in the king’s inner circle have questioned the western Penlop’s loyalty. Perhaps it would be best if the king personally led this force."
 bhutan.11.a:0 "Tshering Penjor may lead the vanguard"
 bhutan.11.b:0 "King Jigme will lead this army"

 bhutan.12.t:0 "Word from Phuentscholing"
 bhutan.12.d:0 "Sonam Topgye has sent word from his estate on the Indian border, stating that he has made contact with foreign arms dealers who would be willing to smuggle weapons into the kingdom through Dorji connections in Kalimpong and Calcutta. While these weapons would be useful against the Zhabdrung, this transaction would only further indebt the king to the Dorji family."
 bhutan.12.a:0 "Tell him to call in his contacts"
 bhutan.12.b:0 "We do not need socialist arms!"

 bhutan.400.t:0 "Clash Between Warriors"
 bhutan.400.d:0 "Some of Tshering Penjor’s mercenaries have come into conflict with some of the local militias. These men claim that the mercenaries, Hindu warriors from Nepal, have disrespected a local shrine and stolen equipment. With Tshering Penjor remaining silent on the brewing conflict, it has fallen on the king to reach some agreement."
 bhutan.400.a:0 "Cast these wretched mercenaries out"
 bhutan.400.b:0 "We cannot afford to lose more warriors"

 bhutan.13.t:0 "The Shipment Arrives"
 bhutan.13.d:0 "The shipment of weaponry has arrived in Punakha, bolstering the king’s collection of old flintlocks and surplus weltkrieg rifles."
 bhutan.13.a:0 "Well done Dorji!"

 bhutan.14.t:0 "Demands from Our Vassals"
 bhutan.14.d:0 "With Sonam Topgye’s shipment of foreign weaponry arriving without incident, discussions began about who exactly would receive the guns. While the Royal Guard remains under-equipped, many of our vassals still field armies of swords and bows."
 bhutan.14.a:0 "We need these guns for our own men"
 bhutan.14.b:0 "Give some arms to our most loyal allies"
 bhutan.14.c:0 "Share our new weaponry with all of our allies"

 bhutan.15.t:0 "The Zhabdrung is Located"
 bhutan.15.d:0 "While there were many who feared that the Zhabdrung had managed to flee to Tibet, Nepal, or the Bharatiya Commune, reports have come through that the young lama is gathering his supporters at Talo Monastery in the hills north of Punakha. Many believe that he aims to gather an army there before heading south to reclaim his lands and former powers. The majority of the court feel that while the Zhabdrung remains alive, he is a threat to Bhutan’s stability."
 bhutan.15.a:0 "The king must act"

 bhutan.16.t:0 "March on Talo"
 bhutan.16.d:0 "The march from Punakha to nearby Talo Monastery has started to reveal how powerful the Zhabdrung has become over the last decades. Our army has been harassed consistently since turning south, and the hope of catching our opponent off guard has been dashed. The further we drive into the Zhabdrung’s territories, the clearer it becomes that our numerical and martial advantage is less pronounced than once thought."
 bhutan.16.a:0 "We continue into the belly of the beast"

 bhutan.17.t:0 "Siege of Talo"
 bhutan.17.d:0 "The royal coalition has faced far greater resistance than expected from the forces loyal to the Zhabdrung, but has managed to organise a proper siege of Talo Monastery. While the king’s army outnumbers those within the monastery by hundreds of men, and is armed with small arms and a cannon, it has become increasingly clear that an open confrontation would be devastating, both to the royal army and Jigme’s credibility. Even more worrying are the conflicts beginning between mercenaries loyal to Sonam Topgye Dorji and a number of Tshering Penjor’s levies. The king struggles to maintain discipline and worries that many within the coalition would sooner turn on each other than face the Zhabdrung."
 bhutan.17.a:0 "Perhaps a solution will present itself"

 bhutan.18.t:0 "Samten Jamtsho Presents a Solution"
 bhutan.18.d:0 "The king’s closest ally among the monastic body, Samten Jamtsho, has returned from a meeting he had with many of the monks within the temple. Invoking the ancient role of Bhutanese monks as mediators of peace, the monks within Talo Monastery would be willing to arrange a meeting between the king and the Zhabdrung, nominally to determine the fate of the young upstart. While Tshering Penjor has expressed his concern regarding the safety of such a meeting, Samten Jamtsho is adamant that the monks could guarantee the safety of the king. Such a meeting would thrust the king into the lion’s den, but it may be our only chance to avoid the bloodshed of open conflict. With the tensions within the king’s forces mounting, it may be the only option he has left."
 bhutan.18.a:0 "We have no choice but to take this risk!"
 bhutan.18.b:0 "Maintain the Siege! We can wait out this upstart"

 bhutan.19.t:0 "The Monks of Talo"
 bhutan.19.d:0 "The continued siege of Talo Monastery has taken a toll on its inhabitants. A number of monks, gaunt with the signs of starvation, have snuck out of the fortress to conspire with the Je Khenpo’s representative Samten Jamtsho, seeking to negotiate peace. Samten Jamtsho, a loyal agent of the king, has instructed them that lasting stability within the country will only be found in a world without the Zhabdrung. While the majority of the monks here are repulsed by such an idea, in the absence of the Je Khenpo Choekyi Wangchuck, Samten Jamtsho is the highest monastic authority present, barring the Zhabdrung of course. The group has returned to the monastery, their minds laden heavy with the task at hand."
 bhutan.19.a:0 "A necessary evil"

 bhutan.20.t:0 "Sudden Death of Zhabdrung Jigme Dorji"
 bhutan.20.d:0 "A delegation of Monks, including a number of the king’s conspiratorial group, has approached the king and his allies. They revealed that the Zhabdrung tragically passed away in the night, in a death so sudden and silent that even the monks studying in the room adjacent heard nothing. While the mood among the king’s party is sombre, there is a great deal of relief that there will not be greater bloodshed on this day."
 bhutan.20.a:0 "We must begin to rebuild"

 bhutan.21.t:0 "Withdrawal to Punakha"
 bhutan.21.d:0 "As the king’s forces begin their journey back to the capital, a silence hangs heavy on the countryside. In villages and lamaseries across the nation, furtive whispers level accusations against the king and his allies. Many speak in hushed tones of a silk scarf in the night, either as the last act of the desperate Zhabdrung, or the tool of an agent of the king. At the same time, official messengers spread the word of the Zhabdrung’s tragic death of natural causes. Their reports mix accusations of the Zhabdrung’s infidelity and moral degradation with tales of King Jigme’s sorrowful mourning over the death of his rival and de-jure overlord. While few fully believe this story, none would dare to openly question it."
 bhutan.21.a:0 "Better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both"

 bhutan.22.t:0 "Jigme Ambushed"
 bhutan.22.d:0 "The meeting between Jigme Wangchuck and his rival began cordially, but it soon became clear that the Zhabdrung had little intention to surrender and plead forgiveness. He instead began to berate the young king, mixing insult with threat. As his tirade reached a fevered pitch, one of the king’s personal guards drew his blade and began to advance on the Zhabdrung, provoking a frenzied response from the young lama’s supporters. A large group of warriors, armed with knives and swords, fell upon the king and his entourage. Several of his guards fell to their blades, and the king himself only barely escaped, badly wounded. The king was taken immediately to his personal tent, and healers work desperately to bring him back from the brink of death. With the king incoherent and incapacitated, all eyes have turned to Tshering Penjor to avenge the king in an assault against the monastic fortress."
 bhutan.22.a:0 "The snake revealed"

 bhutan.23.t:0 "End of the Zhabdrung"
 bhutan.23.d:0 "In response to the treachery of the Zhabdrung, Tshering Penjor has claimed that an evil spirit had possessed the leader of Talo Monastery and that it was the duty of any faithful man to smite this demon. The fight for the fortress was short, brutal, and bloody. All who opposed the royal forces were put to death. At the height of the fighting, the Zhabdrung was found hiding in his chamber and unceremoniously executed by some of Tshering Penjor's soldiers. The western Penlop then brought the head out to the remainder of the late Zhabdrung’s supporters and announced that they were free of the evil spirit’s spell. The army has begun the march back to Punakha, even as the condition of King Jigme further deteriorates."
 bhutan.23.a:0 "A kingdom on the edge..."

 bhutan.24.t:0 "The King Passes Away"
 bhutan.24.d:0 "The capital is in a state of mourning. His majesty the wise and honourable Jigme Wangchuck has passed away, suffering from a number of wounds he received at the hands of the treacherous snake of Talo Monastery. As the family of the king gather to celebrate his short but illustrious life and begin funeral preparations, two notable men of the nation are absent. Tshering Penjor has withdrawn from the capital with a number of his closest allies, gathering support among the western penlops. No word has come from Sonam Topgye Dorji either, and a number of prominent reform-minded nobles have departed the court to parts unknown."
 bhutan.24.a:0 "Vultures loom over a rotting corpse"

 bhutan.25.t:0 "Tshering Penjor Crowned in Paro"
 bhutan.25.d:0 "In a ceremony attended by a number of powerful figures in Bhutan, most notably the Je Khenpo Choekyi Wangchuck and his Lopen Samten Jamtsho, as well as military leader Namgyal Bahadur, Tshering Penjor has finally been crowned as the Druk Gyalpo. The former Penlop of Paro, a sombre military man, has pledged to defend Bhutan from foreign aggressors, and has already begun to speak of creating a new Royal Bhutan Army, led by his close allies. Once again has the Raven Crown been returned to its rightful place, atop the head of the Druk Gyalpo."
 bhutan.25.a:0 "The king is dead, long live the king!"

 bhutan.26.t:0 "Confrontation at Phuentscholing"
 bhutan.26.d:0 "That rabble-rouser Sonam Topgye Dorji has begun a march north from the Indian border with a small army of mercenaries. He aims to crown the late King’s young son as the next Druk Gyalpo. While he has gathered some support, both he and his puppet pose no threat to us while they are south of the southern mountain passes. Namgyal Bahadur has gathered the Royal Bodyguard and a small army of loyal soldiers to meet this host of rebels before they can reach the capital. While Namgyal Bahadur seeks to destroy Sonam Topgye’s forces, many within the court have advocated for a more conciliatory approach."
 bhutan.26.a:0 "We will meet and settle this matter"
 bhutan.26.b:0 "Either Dorji stands down or he will be cut down!"

 bhutan.27.t:0 "Civil War Averted"
 bhutan.27.d:0 "In a meeting coordinated by the Je Khenpo, the two opposing factions have reached an agreement to resolve the brewing civil war before any more blood can be shed. Tshering Penjor has named the young Jigme Dorji Wangchuck as his heir and granted the young king the Trongsa Penlop. He also promised to respect Sonam Topgye’s interests in the south of the country and grant the statesman considerable autonomy in return for an annual payment of guns and Indian trade goods. Though there is some question as to whether the peace crafted here will last, the two armies have departed without incident to Paro and Trongsa."
 bhutan.27.a:0 "It is good that he was able to see reason"

 bhutan.28.t:0 "Back from the Edge"
 bhutan.28.d:0 "The battle between Sonam Topgye’s mercenaries and Namgyal Bahadur’s Royal Guardsmen was both quick and bloody. Though both sides suffered considerable casualties, the Royal forces were barely able to repel the usurpers. Seeking to resolve the conflict, the Je Khenpo has negotiated a truce that satisfies the two parties. Tshering Penjor has promised to name Jigme Dorji Wangchuck as his heir and Sonam Topgye as the Penlop of Trongsa, in return for an annual shipment of arms from the Dorji patriarch."
 bhutan.28.a:0 "We found peace at the end of the sword"

 bhutan.29.t:0 "Jigme Dorji Crowned in Phuentscholing"
 bhutan.29.d:0 "In a ceremony attended by a number of powerful figures in Bhutan, most notably the Je Khenpo Choekyi Wangchuck, former Chogyal Tashi Namgyal, and the head of the Royal Bodyguards, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, the young son of the late king Jigme, has been crowned as the Druk Gyalpo. Few suspect that the new king, the eight-year-old Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, will amount to much more than a pawn of Sonam Topgye Dorji and his allies, at least in the short term. Notably absent from this gathering was Tshering Penjor and a number of his military allies, Namgyal Bahadur among them."
 bhutan.29.a:0 "The king is dead, long live the king!"

 bhutan.30.t:0 "Tshering Penjor Withdraws to Paro"
 bhutan.30.d:0 "As more and more penlops and lords pledge their support for the new Wangchuck king, Tshering Penjor has once again withdrawn to his personal fiefdom in the west. He has refused all invitations to the capital and silently fumes in his palace at Paro. Tshering Penjor has not made any moves openly against the young Jigme Dorji, offering an opportunity to bury the hatchet between the rebellious lord and his liege. Some of the king’s advisers have suggested that a large gift could win over the support of Tshering Penjor, while others feel that the Paro Penlop will come to terms of his own accord, realising the futility of resisting the king."
 bhutan.30.a:0 "Send him a caravan of Indian trade goods"
 bhutan.30.b:0 "We do not need his support!"

 bhutan.31.t:0 "Tshering Penjor Acquiesces"
 bhutan.31.d:0 "Seeing the situation turn against him, Tshering Penjor has begrudgingly accepted Jigme Dorji as the legitimate king of Bhutan. While this promises a return to a sorely needed peace, the loyalty of Tshering Penjor towards the new administration is questionable at best. The western Penlop certainly will not take this opportunity to begin sending taxes our way. With the nominal support of Tshering Penjor, however, the young king, and more importantly his regent, can begin to implement the reforms that the kingdom needs."
 bhutan.31.a:0 "Peace at last"

 bhutan.32.t:0 "Tshering Penjor Returns the Crown"
 bhutan.32.d:0 "Seeing the situation turn against him, Tshering Penjor has begrudgingly accepted Jigme Dorji as the legitimate king of Bhutan, sending the young king the Raven Crown, so that he may undergo a formal coronation. This action promises a return to a sorely needed peace and shows a commitment towards young Jigme Dorji that goes beyond his father. Some believe Tshering Penjor is angling to take a greater part in the young king’s upbringing and administration, while others feel that the Penlop has grown tired of resisting the central authority. Regardless, the western Penlop certainly will not take this opportunity to begin sending taxes our way. With the support of Tshering Penjor, however, the young king, and more importantly his regent, can begin to implement the reforms that the kingdom needs."

Sonam Topgye has travelled to Calcutta to meet with the Mahatma, drafting a new treaty of friendship. As an old associate of the Indian leader, Sonam Topgye Dorji was able to effectively negotiate a solid bilateral agreement between the two nations. Gandhi has promised increased Indian investment into the mountain kingdom and returned the lands around Deothang, in return for some political reforms and the legalisation of the Bharatiya aligned Druk National Congress."

Sonam Topgye has travelled to Calcutta to meet with the Tiger of Bengal, intending to draft a new treaty of friendship. While initially negotiations began to stall out, they were salvaged by young moderate leader Jawaharlal Nehru, who proposed a closer bilateral agreement which promises increased Indian investment into the mountain kingdom, in return for political reforms and the legalisation of the Bharatiya aligned Druk National Congress."

Unfortunately, these diplomats have been turned away at the Indian border, which has significantly tightened following Bose’s ascension. It seems that the new chairman’s promise to cease all negotiations with ‘reactionary’ powers was more than just bark. We will have to see how this new diplomatic relationship will pan out, but it is clear that the new enemy on our borders has stoked traditional isolationist thought domestically."
 bhutan.49.a:0 "Tragic"

 bhutan.50.t:0 "Bose Breaks the Treaty of Phuentscholing"
 bhutan.50.d:0 "After seizing power in the Commune, Subhas Chandra Bose has rapidly reversed the diplomatic agreements made between Sonam Topgye Dorji and his predecessor. Blasting these treaties as an example of his domestic opponents’ weakness, Bose has militarised the border and began turning away merchants and diplomats alike. We will have to see how this new diplomatic relationship will pan out, but it is clear that the new enemy on our borders has stoked traditional isolationist thought domestically."
 bhutan.50.a:0 "Tragic"

 bhutan.51.t:0 "Direction for our Military"
 bhutan.51.d:0 "While there are few in our government who do not believe that our military requires reform, the direction of that reform is a source of intense debate. Reform-minded members of the court advocate for increased investment into the local militias of Bhutan, aiming to strengthen its defence, while the traditionalist leader Namgyal Bahadur repeatedly calls for the creation of a small but effective central army."

 bhutan.52.t:0 "The National Assembly"
 bhutan.52.d:0 "Gongzim and Regent Sonam Topgye Dorji has called for the creation of a National Assembly, to advise the king and provide a voice for more localised issues. While he has determined that such a council should be made up of twenty representatives, presided over by a Dorji Gongzim, there still remains the issue of who exactly should fill these seats. With the assembly given the power to introduce recommendations to the reigning king, such a matter could define the nation for years to come."

The assembly is made up of twenty members, each representing a number of Gewogs, small administrative districts containing a few villages. While in Punakha they drafted up a number of plans for their future meetings, and aim to begin formally advising the king at their next meeting.

The assembly is made up of twenty members, nine appointed by each of Penlop governors, one representing the monasteries, and ten representing a number of Gewogs, small administrative districts containing a few villages.

 bhutan.55.t:0 "The National Assembly Radicalises"
 bhutan.55.d:0 "In the last two meetings of the National Assembly, the body has drafted a number of advisory pieces for the king. Unfortunately, the Speaker of the Assembly Sonam Topgye has contended that a number of these proposals were far too radical, calling upon resources that the crown did not have, and disrupting the central planning that the Gongzim has long called for. In response to the increased antagonism between Sonam Topgye and the council, many members have begun advocating for more power to be given to the assembly, forming a new power block of radical reformers."
 bhutan.55.a:0 "A dangerous new faction"

 bhutan.56.t:0 "The National Assembly Stagnates"
 bhutan.56.d:0 "The last two meetings of the National Assembly have been an exercise in futility.

 bhutan.58.t:0 "The King Falls Ill"
 bhutan.58.d:0 "King Jigme has long suffered from bouts of weakness. The commonly held belief is that this ailment is the result of a curse. Legend tells of a spirit that inhabits the woods surrounding the summer Dzong, which cast this dark magic on the young Jigme as punishment for hunting without leaving the proper sacrifices. Ever since this incident, Jigme has suffered under the curse, which would send him into fits of exhaustion. Recently, however, the king has been visited by a young Hindu doctor, who has presented an alternative diagnosis. He claims that the king is suffering from a heart condition. Many in court are outraged with this assertion, which calls into question the king’s health and belittles the power of woodland spirits."

 bhutan.59.t:0 "The King Seeks Treatment"
 bhutan.59.d:0 "In response to the worrying diagnosis of a Hindu doctor, Jigme has begun to patronise a number of men familiar with medicine and disease.

 bhutan.61.d:0 "Jigme has kept a number of royal horses in his years as king. Having been raised with horsemanship as one of the central pieces of his martial education, his love for riding has not diminished since his childhood. Thus, it has become well known that the gift of a horse, if one could afford it, could deliver a great degree of royal support. A minor noble recently arrived in the capital, bringing with him a beautiful grey Tibetan pony."
 bhutan.61.a:0 "A gift fit for a king!"

 bhutan.62.t:0 "The Grand Feast"
 bhutan.62.d:0 "During his time as Penlop of Paro, Tshering Penjor was often the first Bhutanese leader to meet foreign visitors, who would pass through the active trading roads in the Paro valley to continue on to the capital. It was in this capacity that Tshering Penjor became known for his large feasts, entertaining guests with Black-Hat Mask Dances and tours of his estate. It was during this period that he became well known by British envoys, who lavished him with gifts and prestige, but referred to him by the derogatory name Sir Cumference. In the years following the collapse of British rule in India, the number of foreign travellers passing through Paro diminished greatly, but Tshering Penjor’s thirst for revelry did not diminish with it. With the Paro Tshechu festival months away, the hedonistic king has called for a celebration of the monarchy in the capital, with food, games, and events. Tshering Penjor believes that such a celebration will bring the kingdom together after the chaos of the last years."
 bhutan.62.a:0 "There is much to celebrate!"

 bhutan.63.t:0 "Traditionalist Disagreements"
 bhutan.63.d:0 "The Traditionalist faction is based on a union between conservative monks and aristocratic military figures, who banded together to safeguard the kingdom from the influences of Sonam Topgye Dorji and his Reformist allies. While this arrangement has allowed these groups to take control of the country, divisions within the faction have begun to appear. Tshering Penjor falls firmly into the camp of military reformers, and has little regard for the whims of the monks. He is, however, willing to negotiate to maintain the stranglehold that the Traditionalists have over the country."
 bhutan.63.a:0 "Increase the monastic commission"
 bhutan.63.b:0 "Leave them be"

 bhutan.64.t:0 "Factions Reconcile"
 bhutan.64.d:0 "There was a brief period where it appeared that the religious conservatives in Bhutan would abandon the Traditionalist cause, but our fears turned out to be unjustified. After the Je Khenpo and the Zhung Dratshang we told of the concessions made by King Tshering Penjor to the Buddhist cause, dissident voices were silenced and order returned to the court."

 bhutan.65.t:0 "Traditionalist Faction Splits"
 bhutan.65.d:0 "Representatives of the Je Khenpo recently approached the king with a proposal to commission a new copy of the texts foundational to the Drukpa Lineage of Buddhism. While the king made it incredibly clear that the funds required for such a project would have to instead go to the creation of the Royal Army, the abbot was not pleased with the response. It was not long before many Traditionalist monastic leaders began joining the representative in his condemnation, with some going as far as to leave the capital in disgust. Truly this seems to have been the straw that broke the camel’s back, with hundreds of once-loyal allies turning their back to us."
 bhutan.65.a:0 "At least they aren’t Reformists"

 bhutan.66.t:0 "Zamadar Chencho Promoted"
 bhutan.66.d:0 "Having long served as a loyal but unassuming military figure, Zamadar Chencho is a key part of the new initiatives for a modern military force. It is for these qualities that we have decided to make him Quartermaster of the new Royal Bhutan Army. In our nation, where resources are limited and each gun is valuable, having such a capable figure as Quartermaster will surely be a boon."

 bhutan.67.d:0 "With Jigme Dorji poised to assume the throne, the nature of his education could have wide-reaching effects on the future of the kingdom. As of now, Jigme Dorji has been schooled around the capital and in bordering India, with courtiers and tutors supplementing his basic education, and one of the great Lopen teachers providing him with the fundamentals of the Drukpa Buddhist lineage. The young king has approached his studies with enthusiasm, and he shows great promise as a prospective statesman. He stands now at an important pivoting point, his last years of schooling will surely colour his approach to ruling the nation"

 bhutan.69.d:0 "Bhutanese society is structured as a traditional feudal hierarchy, with thousands of powerless serfs ruled over by a collection of aristocrats and lamas, along with their armies of bureaucrats. While these serfs are represented by Gewog village leaders, they have next to no rights and are often abused by their suzerains. While the Traditionalists are contented to retain this cruel and outdated system of governance, men like Sonam Topgye Dorji have begun experimenting with a more liberal approach, freeing his personal peasantry from their traditional bondage and implementing a new system of taxation. His efforts have improved the quality of life in his fiefdom, and he claims that his new taxes will bring in an equal amount of revenue once his personal bureaucracy manages to properly implement them. Perhaps we should widen the scope of his experiment."

 bhutan.70.t:0 "Liberalisation Stagnates"
 bhutan.70.d:0 "Though our campaign to eradicate serfdom was well-intentioned, it has largely failed in the face of uncooperative officials and an apathetic populace. With the nobility unwilling to relinquish their traditional prerogatives, and villages given little incentive to fight for their newly-promised rights, very little has actually changed in Bhutan. Though the peasantry are no longer called serfs, they have gotten precious little aside from a new name."
 bhutan.70.a:0 "Disappointing"

 bhutan.71.t:0 "Poor Harvest"
 bhutan.71.d:0 "In the country of Bhutan farming is deeply tied to Buddhist canon. The name for agriculture is sonam, the word for blessing, and any land is considered blessed if it is able to support any of the nine crops known as the dru-na-gu: rice, wheat, barley, peas, two kinds of buckwheat, millet, mustard, and soybeans. While good harvests are thus widely considered a gift from higher powers, a bad crop is taken by many to be a sign of discontent among spirits or the reflection of a society that has lost its way. Regardless, the last harvest has fallen short of what was expected, with early frosts and poor conditions contributing to a meagre yield."

 bhutan.71.c:0 "Perhaps if we introduced rice crops to the South?"

 bhutan.72.t:0 "Disorganised Response"
 bhutan.72.d:0 "Turning to local authorities to deal with the poor harvest has proven to be a blunder. While some areas suffer from food shortages, others continue to stockpile surplus cereals. The presence of royal tax collectors in the homes of struggling villagers tries the patience of even the most loyal subject, and public opinion is far from favourable. At the same time, those with grains and the wherewithal to traverse the countryside are becoming wealthy at the expense of the starving."
 bhutan.72.a:0 "Oops"

 bhutan.73.t:0 "New Rice Crops Harvested"
 bhutan.73.d:0 "While rice has been one of the central crops in Bhutan since before the time of the first Zhabdrung, it could only be planted in certain regions of the country, at the banks of the rivers which carve the great valleys of Thimphu, Punakha, Trongsa, and Paro. In the lowlands of the south, tubers like yams and taros make up the bulk of the crop, with the climate considered unsuitable for rice paddies. However, at the behest of the Gongzim Sonam Topgye Dorji, the crop has been introduced to the region. Using a complex system of irrigation canals and new breeds of rice better suited to the climate, the experiment has largely worked, with a much larger crop available, and greater food security."
 bhutan.73.a:0 "Fantastic!"

 bhutan.74.t:0 "Agitator in the South"
 bhutan.74.d:0 "It has come to our attention that a village leader has been openly criticising our government. This Mandal, Pashupati Adhikari, is a member of the Lhotshampa minority, a group of Nepalese who migrated into Bhutan from their homelands in Nepal and Assam. His complaints are linked to the special land taxes levelled against these Lhotshampas, and his message is beginning to resonate with the other Lhotshampa villages. We have reason to believe that the root of this treasonous talk is the Gorkha League, a dangerous gang of Lhotshampa radicals who advocate Nepalese succession."

While now is no time to solve the issue of the Lhotshampa, perhaps we should address this development before things get out of hand."

 bhutan.77.t:0 "The Hunting Accident"
 bhutan.77.d:0 "As he grows older, the young Jigme Dorji has shown great promise as a hunter, with admirable skill as an archer and horseman. His mentors, quite pleased with his skill and enthusiasm, commissioned a tiger hunt in the southern lowlands to test the mettle of Jigme Dorji. While the hunt began in high spirits, tragedy soon struck when Jigme Dorji was thrown from his horse unexpectedly, causing him minor injuries and ending the prospects of the hunt. The unsuccessful huntsman is now bedridden and will be for some time to heal fully. Hopefully, he will not die of boredom in the meantime."

 bhutan.77.b:0 "Oh well..."

 bhutan.78.t:0 "The Economy of Bhutan"
 bhutan.78.d:0 "Oftentimes the mountain kingdom of Bhutan is regarded as the best example in the world of a nation untouched by the industrial revolution. The majority of labour in the country is devoted to subsistence farming, and there is little opportunity to develop advanced trades. Construction is handled through a system of brutal corvee labour, with impressed villagers labouring to implement building plans which have remained static for the last four hundred years. Most production occurs in small cottage workshops, where rare skilled artisans ply crafts passed down through the generations. Some of these artisans have been employed by the king personally in the art of weapon crafting, a task which few of them are keen and fewer still competent. With the situation in the kingdom tenuous there is little room for change, but were any one man to solidify their position at the head of the nation, they would certainly want to reform the system."
 bhutan.78.a:0 "Each rifle is handcrafted!"

 bhutan.79.t:0 "The Treaty of Phuentscholing"
 bhutan.79.d:0 "As the revolution in India reached a grinding stalemate, the tiny kingdom of Bhutan was forced to make a difficult choice. Long supported by the British administration, it seemed only natural for the monarchy in Punakha to continue to reinforce their Windsor counterparts. On the other hand, the days of British hegemony in India seemed more than numbered, and a small cabal of ministers and nobles began to open channels of communication with the young Indian republic. With India thoroughly focused on the situation to the south, the Bhutanese mission, led by Sonam Topgye Dorji, managed to negotiate terms equitable to the former treaties with Great Britain, promising a policy of non-interference in Indian affairs in return for economic assistance. Both sides benefited from the agreement, India was recognised by a former ally of the crown and assured their continued control over the Duars, while Bhutan retained the important economic allowance which largely fuelled the central government. Recently, however, tensions have been mounting between the two nations, as eyes once again turn to the possibility of war in the Indian subcontinent. Many have doubts about King Jigme’s commitment to neutrality in the coming conflict, and there are some who would like to see him removed from power, if only to eliminate the chance of a Bhutanese intervention in the coming conflict."
 bhutan.79.a:0 "The treaty makes us strong!"

 bhutan.80.t:0 "The Treaty of Phuentscholing Abandoned"
 bhutan.80.d:0 "In many ways, the Treaty of Phuentscholing was the personal achievement of Sonam Topgye Dorji. Against all odds the young minister saved the hermit kingdom from being truly cut off from the rest of the world, forging a new relationship with the south. Tshering Penjor cares little about the rest of the world, however, and is more than content to disregard India. With this in mind, the king has stopped sending diplomats to Calcutta and has restricted the agency of Sonam Topgye Dorji to interact with his counterparts to the south, fearful that he may find support for a coup there. To the Indians Tshering Penjor is a safe man to lead Bhutan, he has little loyalty to the British and little care for exactly how much aid flows into the country. While the relationship between Bhutan and India is far from dead, it is clear that the two nations are growing more and more distant."
 bhutan.80.a:0 "The treaty made us weak!"

 bhutan.81.t:0 "Strange Reports from the South"
 bhutan.81.d:0 "Sonam Topgye Dorji has warned us of rumours he has heard in Phuentscholing. They speak of a strange caravan marching north towards central Bhutan, evading villages and fellow travellers. It is possible that this party is a group of the Zhabdrung’s supporters or even just a gang of bandits looking to evade our patrols. However, Namgyal Bahadur has presented an even more worrying prospect, that the caravan may hold soldiers and modern supplies from India. While Sonam Topgye is insistent that the Bharatiya Commune would not threaten the relations between the two nations, perhaps it would be a good idea to investigate this matter further."
 bhutan.81.a:0 "Send Namgyal Bahadur to investigate"
 bhutan.81.b:0 "Ask Sonam Topgye to personally investigate"
 bhutan.81.c:0 "We cannot afford to chase rumours!"

 bhutan.82.t:0 "Rumoured Caravan Disappears"
 bhutan.82.d:0 "We have called on our local contacts to try to find the mysterious smugglers, but with little success. One day our forces hear of strange men marching east towards the Paro valley, but the next speaks of sightings of foreign-looking traders in northern Daga. Whoever these mystery men were, they have disappeared into the hills or found refuge in a rebellious village."
 bhutan.82.a:0 "Perhaps they never existed at all?"

 bhutan.83.t:0 "Namgyal Bahadur Confirms Rumours"
 bhutan.83.d:0 "After coercing some village elders, Namgyal Bahadur is sure that the rumoured caravan is both real and heading towards the Trongsa Valley. With this information in hand, he is confident that the caravan is aiming to join up with the Zhabdrung’s forces. Namgyal Bahadur feels that the best course of action would be to station his soldiers on the main roads into Punakha so that they could lay an ambush for the approaching caravan. Others in the party have voiced their concern, however, that the smugglers may try to avoid the main roads and instead advise that the party spread his forces throughout the mountain passes leading north. While spreading his forces thinly would leave him weak to attack, concentrating them might let the caravan slip through his fingers."
 bhutan.83.a:0 "Prepare an ambush on the main road"

 bhutan.84.t:0 "Sonam Topgye Confirms Rumours"
 bhutan.84.d:0 "After bribing some village elders, Sonam Topgye is confident that the rumoured caravan is both real and heading towards the Trongsa Valley. With this information in hand, he believes that the caravan may be smugglers attempting to sell arms to the Zhabdrung and his allies. With the enemy known to be moving on roads between the king’s personal forces and Sonam Topgye’s expedition, the Gongzim is now presented with a decision. The king's liaison with his forces has suggested that Sonam Topgye send his scouts riding up the main road to Punakha to mobilise the Royal Guard, allowing them to set up an ambush and catch the rebels between their two forces. Sonam Topgye, however, is confident that his own forces can take on the smugglers, and plans to march north as soon as possible to catch the smugglers while they are stuck on the main road. While splitting his forces would leave him weak to attack, concentrating them might let the caravan slip out of his reach."

 bhutan.85.t:0 "Namgyal Bahadur Catches Caravan"
 bhutan.85.d:0 "Just when it appeared that the Royal Guard were wasting their time defending the road, harassing pilgrims and local traders, our outrider scouts located the caravan making its way up to our positions. With our carefully planned ambush, we were able to completely overwhelm the caravan guards. While the majority of the men we captured were rebellious monks, there were a few Indian soldiers among them, potentially mercenaries. Also found in the caravan were modern Indian machine guns and small arms, along with foodstuffs and other goods. The capture of this caravan is a major victory, supplying our own forces and denying these supplies to the Zhabdrung. Of course, much of the armaments found in the caravan did not make it back to the king, with a large number lost on the road back to Punakha, almost certainly bled to fill Tshering Penjor’s personal armouries."
 bhutan.85.a:0 "Fantastic!"

 bhutan.86.t:0 "Sonam Topgye Catches Caravan"
 bhutan.86.d:0 "It did not take long before Sonam Topgye’s forces made contact with the caravan, which was travelling slowly north on the main road into Punakha. Fighting was fierce, but the caravan was overwhelmed after some of our scouts flanked their defensive position and charged from the north. While the majority of the men we captured were rebellious monks, there were a few Indian soldiers among them, potentially mercenaries. Also found in the caravan were modern Indian machine guns and small arms, along with foodstuffs and other goods. The capture of this caravan is a major victory, supplying our own forces and denying these supplies to the Zhabdrung.

 bhutan.87.d:0 "When our loyal forces sighted the caravan on the main road north to Punakha, they moved to engage these mysterious opponents. Unfortunately, our patrol was not prepared to be met with a storm of modern machine-gun fire. The weak patrol was unable to advance in the face of such advanced weaponry, and was forced to retreat. What our forces initially thought were allied reinforcements turned out to instead be more rebels, who completely routed our soldiers. With the complete destruction of one of our patrols, the chance of intercepting the armed caravan is nearly impossible."
 bhutan.87.a:0 "We cannot lose to this upstart again!"

 bhutan.88.t:0 "End of the Royal Coalition"
 bhutan.88.d:0 "In response to the treachery of the Zhabdrung, Tshering Penjor has claimed that an evil spirit had possessed the leader of Talo Monastery and that it was the duty of any faithful man to smite this demon. The fight for the fortress was short, brutal, and bloody. The royal forces stormed the main gate into the monastery courtyard, only to be met with a torrent of machine-gun fire from raised positions. With the brunt of the assault broken by the defenders, the tide rapidly shifted as the undisciplined levies attempted to escape the deadly courtyard. Tshering Penjor was cut down as he attempted to re-form his soldiers, and it was not long before the royal forces shattered entirely. The rebel forces raided the camps formed near the monastery, capturing the dying king and seizing supplies and weapons. With the road to Punakha open and no remaining forces who could oppose the Zhabdrung’s growing army, the Zhabdrung seems poised to capture the capital."
 bhutan.88.a:0 "Where is the king’s heir?"

 bhutan.89.t:0 "Heir and Gongzim Disappear"
 bhutan.89.d:0 "Sonam Topgye Dorji and the heir to the Bhutanese throne Jigme Dorji Wangchuck are considered by most within the Royal court as the only men which could save Bhutan. However, both are nowhere to be found, with the king having been sent south with Sonam Topgye in the opening days of the conflict. While some seem to believe that the Gongzim will attempt to mount a counterattack from his base in the south of the country, most realise that without the support of the Royal Guard or Tshering Penjor’s hosts, the most that Sonam Topgye could muster would be a small group of mercenaries. With the remnants of central authority diminishing, several Penlops seem almost celebratory about the end of the monarchy."
 bhutan.89.a:0 "Treachery from all sides!"

 bhutan.90.t:0 "Monasteries Recognise Zhabdrung"
 bhutan.90.d:0 "The monasteries of Bhutan have long made up the base of support for the Zhabdrung Jigme Dorji’s bid for power. The Central Monastic body, led by a council of five Lopen Rinpoches and the powerful Je Khenpo, is possibly the single strongest political force in the Kingdom of Bhutan. While initially it appeared that the Zhabdrung had only garnered support from the lower ranked members of the massive theological apparatus, in the days following the destruction of the king’s forces three of the Lopen masters began expressing their quiet support for the young Zhabdrung. While the most senior Lopen Samten Jamtsho and the Je Khenpo Choekyi Wangchuck have both remained silent on the matter, it is becoming clear that the Zhabdrung’s influence is greater than what was once thought."
 bhutan.90.a:0 "Rats jumping from a sinking ship"

 bhutan.91.t:0 "The Zhabdrung Ascendant"
 bhutan.91.d:0 "With the military forces loyal to the late king completely eliminated, the monastic body rapidly expressing a change of loyalty, and the remaining noble leaders withdrawing to their Dzong Fortresses, the Zhabdrung and his allies stand as the preeminent force in Bhutan. Calling upon the formation of a new Lhengye Zhungtshog, the ancient council body which helped the first Zhabdrungs govern the nation, the Zhabdrung Jigme Dorji has requested the presence of the Central Monastic Body at Talo Monastery. In doing so, Jigme Dorji has finally expressed his desire to rule over Bhutan as the Zhabdrung once did. With few standing up to oppose him, it seems that he has succeeded in reviving the Choe-Sid diarchy. Not since the days of the Ngawang Namgyal has the Zhabdrung wielded this much temporal power!"
 bhutan.91.a:0 "The legacy of Ngawang Namgyal realised"

 bhutan.92.t:0 "Renovating our Dzongs"
 bhutan.92.d:0 "Dzongs are fortified monasteries which serve as the religious, military, administrative, and social centers. While many of the Dzongs of Bhutan were initially built in the late medieval period, they remain the focal points of government power in the nation. Dzongs are typically divided into two parts, with half of the fortress devoted to the secular functions of the penlops governors, namely the governance of their feudal territory and defence against bandits and foreign invaders. The other half of these monasteries serve a more religious function, primarily as the temple and housing for monks. This division between administrative and religious functions reflects the idealised duality of power in Bhutan, where the role of the monks is critical to the success of the state. As we expand some of these fortresses, we will have to navigate the dual nature of their purpose, either favouring an element of their function or attempting to maintain the ancient balance."
 bhutan.92.a:0 "A religious focus"
 bhutan.92.b:0 "The Dzongs are forts!"
 bhutan.92.c:0 "Why not both?"

 bhutan.93.t:0 "Expanding Punakha"
 bhutan.93.d:0 "The Punakha Dzong, known as the Pungthang Dewachen Phodrang, or the Palace of Great Happiness, was first constructed during the reign of the first Zhabdrung, Ngawang Namgyal. It holds Bhutan’s greatest relics and is the winter residence of both the King and the Central Monastic Body, making it a focal point for both temporal and spiritual power. In recent years, however, the palace has fallen into disrepair, a state of being unfit for the capital of our great nation. We must renovate and expand our great palace, whatever the cost may be. While many of our more fiscally minded advisors are concerned about spending a considerable amount of the central government's funds on a specific building, they have been mostly placated by vague promises that the new wings of the palace shall be used as an administrative nucleus for the kingdom."
 bhutan.93.a:0 "Spare no expense"
 bhutan.93.b:0 "Cut some corners"

 bhutan.94.t:0 "Construction Falters"
 bhutan.94.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, construction on the great Punakha Dzong has faltered, with delays and issues with materials causing significant setbacks. It would be difficult for the king to back down from the growing issue of the Dzong, though he could always fall back on the superstitious explanation that the construction had upset local spirits. Many within the court have advised that we quietly cut our losses, though alternatively, we could reinvest in the project to ensure that it progresses without any more embarrassing setbacks."
 bhutan.94.a:0 "Double our efforts!"
 bhutan.94.b:0 "Cut our losses"

 bhutan.95.t:0 "The New Palace of Happiness"
 bhutan.95.d:0 "After a great deal of effort, the Pungthang Dewachen Phodrang has reopened its doors, its structure more sturdy and trappings as beautiful as ever. Of the elements of the Dzong which have been reinforced, the most important is the strengthening of the bridge over the Mo Chhu River, which nearly washed away in flooding a few years ago. While the monks are made happy by their expanded quarters, the Reformers are delighted that the offices of the civil service have been greatly modernised, with luxury goods brought into the capital from around the world. One of the new additions, however, has not yet been delegated to any specific purpose. How should we use this new wing?"
 bhutan.95.a:0 "New offices for the Reformers"
 bhutan.95.b:0 "A home fit for a king!"

 bhutan.96.t:0 "Ending Court Factionalism"
 bhutan.96.d:0 "For years the court of Bhutan has been divided into squabbling factions. While there will always be conflict in politics, the revolt of the Zhadbrung reincarnation has shown the depth and danger of our disunity. We must strive to bring a degree of harmony to the royal court, even if that means making concessions to either or both of the factions. True unity cannot be found at the end of the sword, instead, we will aim to acknowledge the power and control of our rivals and attempt to find common ground. An arraignment may be difficult to make, but for the good of the kingdom we must unite!"

Now the Nepalese have dug into the mountains of Sikkim, dirtying the glorious temples of the nation with their heathen presence. We will reassert the claims of our forefathers and show our ancient rivals that they are not welcome at our borders! By taking control over a number of mountain passes between western Bhutan and lands claimed by Nepal, we can exercise a degree of control over the borderlands.

In the centuries following his departure from Tibet, a number of villages in western Tibet have accepted the Drukpa Lineage as truth, turning to Bhutanese leaders as suzerains. Today, the villages of Khangri, Tarchen, Tsekhor, Diraphu, Dzung Tuphu, Jangehe, Chakip and Kocha all pay their taxes to Bhutanese leaders, and though they are completely surrounded by Tibet it is well understood that these lands are distinct Bhutanese. The past few years of the Tibetan regency have had an adverse effect on the stability of our holdings in the country. Bandits roam free, harassing our tax collectors and monks. We will have to reassert control of our lands through force. [BHU.GetLeader] will lead an expedition into this land, to show the Tibetans that they must respect our might."

We will send out a band of our finest warriors to reassert our control over the northern Duars and right the wrongs committed against our ancestors. Chances are that the Indian menace is too busy fighting their own brothers to notice our intrusion, and if we are successful, we will reap the wealth of these fertile lands.

While we are unsure if this assault marks the beginning of a war between our nations, or if it is merely the actions of an opportunistic noble within their land, we must decide how to deal with this attack. It appears that if we ignore the attack, the Bhutanese rabble will attempt to assert a degree of control over some of our lands. While such an action would undermine our government, it has little real effect on us. Bhutan is like a mosquito, either we commit to crushing them now, or ignore this minuscule bloodsucking pest."

When the Raj collapsed, the Bhutanese turned their backs on their old overlords, instead turning to the support of the Socialist agitators in Calcutta.

 bhutan.108.d:0 "The foolish Bhutanese have rejected our incredibly generous offer for protection, dooming themselves to continue their existence as a worthless mountain backwater. The only question which remains is whether to crush them, or to leave them to their irrelevance."
 bhutan.108.a:0 "We will teach them a lesson in manners"
 bhutan.108.b:0 "They are not worth the trouble"

 bhutan.109.t:0 "Dealing with the Hermit Kingdom"
 bhutan.109.d:0 "For years, Bhutan existed on the periphery between the Chinese and Indian spheres of control, serving as both a gateway and a battleground between these forces. In the backdrop of the foolish reactionary pissing match between the monstrous British Imperialists and their Russian enemies, Bhutan was brought into the fold of the old Raj as a means of crushing dissent in Tibet. When our revolution pushed the British and their Princely lapdogs out of the east, the Bhutanese came to us, offering to help stabilise our northern border and prevent the Nepalese and Tibetans from taking advantage of our weakness. While we were busy with our enemies to the south and west, it was preferable to be at peace with our northern neighbours, as backwards and repugnant they may be. With the forces of reaction in India defeated, however, we should decide what to do with Bhutan. We could either leave the nation alone, maintaining the status quo, or crush them, ending the reactionary threat on our border. As it stands, the small nation provides a nice buffer between us and China, though control over the Himalayan passes would better let us exert influence to the north."
 bhutan.109.a:0 "Leave them alone"
 bhutan.109.b:0 "Crush these reactionaries!"

 bhutan.110.t:0 "Trade with Socialist India Normalises "
 bhutan.110.d:0 "When the republicans triumphed over their enemies in India, there was a considerable amount of fear that they would turn to destroy our kingdom. However, they instead decided to maintain the status quo, allowing us to benefit greatly from our trade with India. New caravans make their way from Calcutta and Assam to our agents on the border, who have managed to secure a series of deals and treaties codifying trade between our two nations, beneficial to both states."
 bhutan.110.a:0 "Fantastic!"

 bhutan.111.t:0 "Bureaucratic Cliques Remain"
 bhutan.111.d:0 "Though we triumphed over the forces of the king and are firmly in control of the country, we continue to rely almost entirely on the old regime’s administrative apparatus. While the monasteries and religious orders which make up the majority of our support control to help us govern and manage the nation, we still turn to the tax collectors, gewogs, and even the Penlops of the past. These members of our government were once divided into various bureaucratic cliques which divided the nation in the years before our rise, but when their survival was threatened these groups attempted to portray themselves as apolitical servants, abandoning their bickering. Now that the dust has settled in Bhutan, these groups have resurfaced and once again threaten to tear our administration apart with their conflicts."
 bhutan.111.a:0 "They are too valuable to lose"

 bhutan.112.t:0 "Questionable Military Loyalties"
 bhutan.112.d:0 "For years, the feudal military of Bhutan has allied itself to the Paro Penlop, Tshering Penjor. It was through this nobleman that the growing clique of aristocratic officers began to agitate for increased funding and power, and there were many in the upper echelons of the Bhutanese banners who have begun looking outwards for inspiration. With Tshering Penjor dead at our hands, and the Traditionalist clique shattered by the restoration of his holiness the Zhabdrung Rinpoche, the future of the aristocratic officer corps is in limbo. While we could always dismiss these warriors, they would almost certainly begin agitating against our ambitions."
 bhutan.112.a:0 "Grant them concessions "
 bhutan.112.b:0 "Dismiss the aristocrats"

 bhutan.113.t:0 "Crushing the Bureaucrats"
 bhutan.113.d:0 "When we first crushed the royalists and assumed control of Bhutan, various groups throughout the country pledged themselves to our rule and accepted our dominion over the kingdom. However, the loyalty of these bureaucrats has always been dubious at best, and there is a considerable chance that they conspire amongst themselves, planning the downfall of our most holy rule. Recently, reports have come to the inner circle of our administration that various officials have been caught speaking ill of our rise, reminiscing about the former king, or spreading rumours about the existence of a living Wangchuck heir. This is more than enough justification that the reign of these groups must be brought to an end."
 bhutan.113.a:0 "They are too dangerous to be left alive"

 bhutan.114.t:0 "Demanding Military Loyalty"
 bhutan.114.d:0 "For far too long the temporal lords of Bhutan have had a monopoly on true military force. While the monasteries and villages arm and train militias to protect themselves from bandits, true levies and armed knights are purely led by the Penlops and royalists. With the king’s army crushed at Talo Monastery, the only force left in the country which threatens to undermine us is the combined power of the Penlops, who each command a small personal army. This will not stand! Either we should eliminate a few of these rebellious lords to send a message, or simply crush and undermine this entire class of temporal rulers. No matter what we do it will almost certainly destabilise our rule over the country, but we must make sacrifices for the good of the kingdom."
 bhutan.114.a:0 "Disappear the ringleaders"
 bhutan.114.b:0 "Fill the ranks with loyalists"

 bhutan.115.t:0 "Zhabdrung Sungtrul Demands Authority"
 bhutan.115.d:0 "When the first Zhabdrung Rinpoche Ngawang Namgyal passed away almost three hundred years ago, the Je Khenpo, Druk Desi, and Penlops conspired to cripple the power of the Zhabdrung reincarnations by recognising three different incarnations of the great lama: the mind incarnation, the speech incarnation, and the body incarnation. While the line of the body incarnation died out, and the mind incarnation currently rules over the nation, the speech lama continues to exist in a sort of powerless limbo. The current incarnation has come to the court of his holiness Jigme Dorji requesting a humble position in his inner circle as an advisor. However, the current Zhabdrung ruler has repeatedly stated that the position of the speech Zhabdrung has been tainted by its last incarnation, who weakly ceded his temporal power to the treacherous Wangchuck clan."
 bhutan.115.a:0 "Give him a position in the inner circle"
 bhutan.115.b:0 "Two Zhabdrung incarnations are one too many"

 bhutan.116.t:0 "Advisors Protest New Projects"
 bhutan.116.d:0 "Though his holiness the Zhabdrung Rinpoche has determined, in his infinite wisdom, that Bhutan must look to her neighbours to develop the nation, there are many in his inner circle which are worried about these changes. Some, like Jigme Dorji’s more worldly brother, are in favour of these changes, but the majority of his allies and advisors have vocally cautioned against the Zhabdrung’s plan. While they understand that the Zhabdrung speaks with the authority of the great lama Ngawang Namgyal, a great number of them had begun their support in response to the late king’s modernisation attempts. With the new ruler of the country also advocating for centralisation and industrialisation, they have tried desperately to have him reverse course."
 bhutan.116.a:0 "We will need to evolve to survive"
 bhutan.116.b:0 "Reverse our investments!"

 bhutan.117.t:0 "Generals Demand More Funding"
 bhutan.117.d:0 "Tshering Penjor has long been the figurehead of the aristocratic military of Bhutan, and it was through this position that he was able to claim the throne of Bhutan and cement himself as king. He has since surrounded himself with a council of warriors, nobles, and knights, who spend their days whispering suggestions and demands into his ear. The most recent decisions made by his highness has deeply worried these military men, who fear that the focus of the crown has shifted away from the vision they share. They have since come to the king, requesting that he rethink his position."
 bhutan.117.a:0 "They will get their funding when I say they will!"
 bhutan.117.b:0 "Transfer money from economic projects"

 bhutan.118.t:0 "Tshering Penjor Delegates Power"
 bhutan.118.d:0 "Tshering Penjor has never been fully committed to the duties of government. While he is a capable administrator and an excellent planner of festivals, he is less interested in the intricate details of taxes and other governmental responsibilities. Instead, he is content to devote most of his time to organising the various feasts and events of the royal house and enjoying the benefits afforded to a Bhutanese king. With the king occupied, the maintenance of the royal government more or less falls on the shoulders of the king’s privy council, a gang of noble warriors and loyal stewards."
 bhutan.118.a:0 "Less work means more feasts"

 bhutan.119.t:0 "Tshering Penjor Comes with an Offer"
 bhutan.119.d:0 "While he is now one of the king’s most stalwart allies, Tshering Penjor was once a rival for the throne. In the end, Jigme was able to take control over the kingdom in the days following the death of King Ugyen Wangchuck, but the sombre Paro Penlop Tshering Penjor retained many of the old trappings of royal power, including the second incarnation of the late king’s crown, the beautiful Raven Crown. In the years following the rise of Jigme the crown remained in the possession of Tshering Penjor, and it was long thought to be lost to the pudgy Penlop. Recently Tshering Penjor has come to the king with an offer, however, asking for increased privileges in return for the Raven Crown. While Tshering Penjor asks for much, there are few who would deny the symbolic value of the headwear he is willing to part with."
 bhutan.119.a:0 "A generous offer!"
 bhutan.119.b:0 "Ehhh, it’s not worth it"

 bhutan.120.t:0 "Bhutan Accepts our Offer"
 bhutan.120.d:0 "The wise Bhutanese have accepted our incredibly generous offer for protection, throwing off the shackles of their isolation and joining with us. Even now, our soldiers have stationed themselves at key northern passes, and our merchants have begun to make use of the new relationship between our two nations."
 bhutan.120.a:0 "A foothold in the Himalayas!"

 bhutan.121.t:0 "The 14th Dalai Lama Proclaimed"
 bhutan.121.d:0 "After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1933, the Buddhist faithful across the Himalayas have felt unease. The final years of the Thubten Gyatso saw the Ganden Phodrang assaulted by the forces of Chinese autocracy, Russian mysticism, and Indian democracy. The announcement of the 14th Dalai Lama's ascent in Lhasa defies the worrisome millenarian Kalachakra readers. Several Gelugpa monks in Bhutan have announced to [BHU.GetLeader] their intention to travel to Lhasa to meet the Dalai Lama."
 bhutan.121.a:0 "Have a safe trip!"

 bhutan.122.t:0 "The Presumed Dalai Lama Exiled to Bhutan"
 bhutan.122.d:0 "The strange influence of Indians and Russians in Tibet has resulted in another disaster for the Dalai Lama. Where in 1920, a Russian madman named Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg had usurped the Bogd Khan's rightful power to force Mongolia into the Russian Empire. Now, a Russian mystic named Nicholas Roerich has travelled from St. Petersburg and Sikkim to usurp the Ganden Phodrang using "democracy." We take no stock in Roerich's claim of simultaneously being the 9th Dalai Lama and an atheist Leninist. A group of Gelugpa monks have arrived in Bhutan with a child, Tenzin Gyatso, they claim was found in Amdo as the 14th Dalai Lama. Having already brought great prestige to our lands with their presence, the monks and the 14th Dalai Lama claim they will remain in Bhutan until Tibet has rid itself of this Russian meddler."
 bhutan.122.a:0 "He’ll be safe with us"

 bhutan.123.t:0 "Buddhism Restored to Mongolia"
 bhutan.123.d:0 "Stories of the Mad Baron of Mongolia, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, have frightened children in Bhutan for years. Even among the raiders of the steppes like Ja Lama, Vladimir Lenin and Grigory Semyonov, Ungern's causes the most freight. The man that fought the Chinese into retreat, enslaved and murdered thousands, and called all this "Buddhism" is a cautionary tale for the ages. It brings [BHU.GetLeader] great relief to hear that a group of enlightened monks, loyal to the Bogd Khan above warlords, have overthrown Ungern. Now the tale of a wild Russian so filthy in sacrilege can end. At the end of the story, good Buddhist men saw through foreign aggression and won in the end."
 bhutan.123.a:0 "Now go to sleep, or a Russian will get you!"

 bhutan.124.t:0 "The Chinese Invade Tibet"
 bhutan.124.d:0 "Bhutan and Tibet have had a long historical relationship, starting when an upstart Tibetan lama fled the country with a considerable number of religious artefacts, forming the first Bhutanese nation through a series of valiant victories against his Tibetan opponents. Since then, our nations have oscillated between warm periods of alliance and trade, and cooler periods of violence. When Tibet was still nominally a vassal of the Qing Empire, it was King Ugyen who went with the British to Lhasa to act as an intermediary. Even after the Xinhai Revolution years, Tibet has been threatened by the warlords of the new Qing Empire. Today word has arrived in [BHU.GetLeader]’s court that the Muslim lapdogs of the Ma families have descended upon the Tibetan foothills, attempting to subjugate the Himalayas once and for all. While we have offered our northern neighbours support, we cannot afford to send any of our warriors north while the Indian Republicans threaten our independence."
 bhutan.124.a:0 "We will pray for their victory"

 bhutan.125.t:0 "Reformists Take Power in Tibet"
 bhutan.125.d:0 "Having leveraged his connections with the British, Tibetan statesman Tsarong Dzasa has seized control of Tibet, having marched an army into the capital Lhasa. With the regent and prime minister Trimön having fallen into a bought of insanity, Tsarong is free to pursue his mission of bringing Tibet into the 20th century. Drawing inspiration from the west, Tsarong and his Young Tibet Party seek to modernise the nation through an ambitious plan of economic and political liberalisation. To the reformist faction in the Bhutanese court, the success of Young Tibet is a rallying cry, bringing new faces into the movement and strengthening the resolve of their leaders."
 bhutan.125.a:0 "Sonam Topgye and his allies rejoice!"

 bhutan.126.t:0 "Tibetan Traditionalists Maintain Control"
 bhutan.126.d:0 "In the past year, various forces have threatened to unseat Tibet’s conservative regent and prime minister Trimön. With the agents of Britain and the Chinese KMT defeated by Tibetan militias and soldiers, the traditionalists in Lhasa have solidified themselves as the undisputed masters of the country. This victory of the status quo in Tibet has galvanised the traditionalist faction within our own court, swaying many to their calls for a steady path into the future."
 bhutan.126.a:0 "Tshering Penjor and his allies rejoice!"

 bhutan.127.t:0 "Sonam Topgye Dorji Falls from Grace"
 bhutan.127.d:0 "Gongzim Sonam Topgye Dorji has long been a close confidant of the king, ever since the minister clamoured to give Jigme the crown in the wake of his father’s death. In recent days, however, Jigme has listened to his first minister less and less, instead lending his ear to the Traditionalists under the Tshering Penjor. While Sonam Topgye continues to hold a great deal of power in Bhutan, with his Bhutan House as the centre of southern trade and his position as Gongzim intact, there is no question that his days of preeminence are over. In his place, the king has turned to Tshering Penjor’s two most senior lieutenants, Namgyal Bahadur and Zamadar Chencho, who seek to continue the kingdom’s new trajectory away from reform."
 bhutan.127.a:0 "A new chapter dawns in Bhutan"

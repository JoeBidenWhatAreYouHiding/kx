WAB_people_of_the_dawnland_desc:0 "Most of us can remember times before, when we had first bent our knee to that of foreign bastards. It was our fathers and their fathers who first told us we were People of the Dawnland. Should we not then walk out bravely into this new era's dawn, to make it so your father isn't a liar sitting in his grave?"

WAB_inspiration_of_the_kaiserreich_desc:0 "We now turn our eyes to the foreign shores of Europe, hoping for guidance in how we shall govern in this new era. In particular, one nation has caught the attention of all our leaders; the Kaiserreich. What secrets of state and diplomacy shall they learn as they cross the Atlantic, bound for correspondence with Kaiser Wilhelm the second himself."

WAB_prussian_constitutionalism_desc:0 "The return of our emissaries and dignitaries marked a great change for our home nation's governance. The strange new ideologies they returned with from the old world are now commonplace among our people. With growing popularity, we are now ready to accept the  many new ideas that may come from our like-minded allies of the European political theatre."

WAB_house_of_madockawando_desc:0 "Looking to join others on the post-industrial worlds stage, our nation has begun to promote the royal Madockawando lineage. Those who sit upon its throne are not only well liked by the people, but are more importantly enjoyed by leading figures the world over. With invitations to ceremonies, coronations, and weddings all reaching our royal family , it seems that we've done well in seating ourselves with the nobility of Europe."
WAB_wabanaki_royalty:0 "Wabanaki Royalty"
WAB_wabanaki_royalty_desc:0 "It is no longer a Great Chief the Wabanaki bow to, but instead a new emperor. Through no short feat of political craftsmanship, the different nations have reached an agreement that shall allow the coronation of this emperor to proceed. No longer will those in power be known as chiefs, but instead they shall be invested with the power of kingships. It is a new crown that shall ensure this authority among the people, and one that shall stand as a paragon for those masses moving forward."
WAB_alliance_with_the_church:0 "Alliance with the Church"
WAB_alliance_with_the_church_desc:0 "Our nation now sets to align itself with those it sees as true believers of god. Our nation now formally declares itself as Catholic, and seeks to ally itself with all others that do so as well. We have begun sending our  emissaries to the Vatican, where they will meet with the Pope himself. Soon afterwards we shall then begin the long process of legislating the many new alliances and treaties we shall surely receive interest of."
WAB_saint_henri_membertou:0 "Saint Henri Membertou?"
WAB_saint_henri_membertou_desc:0 "The matter of electing Henri Membertou as a candidate for sainthood by the catholic church has caused a great deal of discourse. We seem to be able to reach no single resolution about our position on the matter. Furthermore, debate between those has been incessant, with those of either position fervently arguing for hours upon end. Whatever we officially decide to place forward as our opinion, it will have be to one considered very carefully."
WAB_royal_army:0 "Imperial Army"
WAB_royal_army_desc:0 "The army we process now stands out as one of those most desired among the nations of the Western hemisphere. By adopting traditional practices from our long time allies of the Kaiserreich, we have been able to turn our army into a effective weapon and deterrent. Now with a traditionally European trained army at our disposal, the only problem we seem to face is finding out how to properly use it."
WAB_the_most_european_indians:0 "The Most European Indians"
WAB_the_most_european_indians_desc:0 "More and more has our nation been trying to distance itself from the tribes that surround it. The discovery of century old treaties still being held with these tribes lead us to begin severing ties with them. With growing concern that news of the events would reach our European allies, we have instead now immediately discontinued all relations with these tribesmen. We can no longer afford to see ourselves as kin to these uncivilized peoples."
WAB_wabanakia_together:0 "Wabanakia Together"
WAB_wabanakia_together_desc:0 "Our nation has experienced an unprecedented and meteoric rise in political prominence. In such a short span of time, we have enfranchised ourselves with conviction and formed a longstanding nationalistic identify. We establish ourselves in the political workings of both hemispheres, and set about to claim reputation throughout them. It is on the backbone of these actions that we can look out to the horizon, proudly walking out to greet the world as the People of the Dawnland."

WAB_leptanet_in_charge:0 "Leptanet in Charge"
WAB_leptanet_in_charge_desc:0 "William Saulis has been elevated to the position of Leptanet, or governor-general in Maliseet. In this position, Saulis has achieved near total control over the government and holds nearly all state power within his own hands, surpassing the extent of control that even the King once held. With the monarch of his people functioning as his puppet, Leptanet Saulis marches unmatched into his destiny, carrying the blazing torch of the Lord with him."
WAB_alliance_with_the_jesuits:0 "Alliance with the Jesuits"
WAB_alliance_with_the_jesuits_desc:0 "To both use and control their influence for our own gain, the administration has moved to formally strike an alliance with the Order of Jesus. Favoring only French and native members of the organization, these Jesuits hold great sway over the lay people of our land, and with their help we shall further our holy mission and spread God’s embrace to all corners of the Dawnland!"

WAB_rally_the_motewolon_desc:0 "The incorporation of Catholicism as the state religion, many natives of spiritual leanings have moved to convert, becoming Catholic Motewolons whom proselytize a syncretic blend of Christian doctrine and indigenous beliefs.

WAB_frenchwolastoq_integralism_desc:0 "Drawing inspiration from the French and Portuguesue, Leptanet Saulis’ new ideology is a unique blend of neo-feudalist, integralist ideology merged with both Indigenous and French cultures and beliefs.

WAB_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "House of Madockawando\n§gStanding as the preeminent noble line of the tribal confederacy, the House of Madockawando brings with it great esteem and honor from the past. Named after the hero of the Penobscots who valiantly fought the English during King William’s War, the House of Madockawando now spreads its wings across the Dawnland, serving as a unifying figure and suzerin to the people of our confederacy. Dominated by the Penobscots and other lesser tribes and influenced heavily by their pro-German ties, the Royal House seeks to reform Wabanaki along the lines of Prussian Constitutionalism, mirroring the Kaiserreich as they carve out a truly noble Kingdom along the Northeastern Seaboard. Attaching themselves to this group, the secretive Mi’kmaq have also tossed their hat in with this group of monarchists and Germanophiles, hoping to ride their wave of prosperity to bring glory and respect to their own people.§!"

WAB_national_populist_party_long:0 "Neqotkuk Clique\n§gFounded and organized in dark back rooms and quiet cellars, the Neqotkuk Clique are one of the most unique political movements in the New World. Gaining inspiration from the Action Française, Portuguese Monarchy, and the Catholic Church, this syncretic group has seamlessly merged together ideas of neo-feudalism, organic integralism, Catholic doctrine, and indigenous spirituality and culture, creating a truly one-of-a-kind wave of thought not seen anywhere else. Hoping to tear down the House of Madockawando, the clique seeks to rebuild the Dawnland in the eye of the Lord Jesus Christ and God above, creating a new shining city upon the hill for all of mankind to look to for inspiration and guidance. Primarily garnering support from the Order of Jesus and the highly-christian Maliseet, the Neqotkuk Clique will stop at nothing to usher in the Light of the Lord to this hallowed land of Wabanaki.§!"

## Events ##

WAB.1.t:0 "Wabanaki Forever!"
WAB.1.d:0 "The lifegiving warmth of the dawning sun rises once again above the lands of the Wabanaki Confederation; the wild borders of our lands stretching from the coast of Nova Scotia to deep into the dark woods of Maine. The cool waters and verdant forests that spread across our lands once again echo with the chatter and chants of the People of the Dawn. With our lands returned to us and our pleas for autonomy heard, a shining future lies before the Wabanaki for the first time in centuries. The people of our united tribes: the greater tribes of the Mi'kmaq, the Maliseet, the Passamaqaudoy, the Penobscot, the Abenaki, and the lesser tribes of the Sokoki and the Missisquoi all once again stand united, breathing fresh and free air. The local White Devils have been exiled from these lands, and our people have moved to cleanse the earth of their taint. The Beringian government has sent aid and teachers from the capital to assist us in our reconstruction, while also teaching our youth, illiterate, or just those willing to learn the new Beringian language, a blend of various native tongues and dialects ranging from Tlingit to Huron and all in between, while also teaching the native languages of our local tribes. They not only bring the gift of language, but also the gift of progress that the current day affords, as the groundwork for major industrial and domestic developmental projects has been laid to catapult this strip of woodlands and coast into the modern day. The future of the Wabana'ki Mawuhkacik looks bright as we People of the Dawn bear witness to a new golden age."
WAB.1.a:0 "Into the Dawn we march, united as one"

WAB.2.t:0 "Meeting the Kaiser"
WAB.2.d:0 "It has come to the attention of our council that the great and honorable Kaiser of the German Empire of all people is a massive admirer and aficionado of Native American culture and history. Being inspired during the wave of interest in the First Peoples that hit Germany at the turn of the century and again during the interwar period, and initially drawing interest from the common archetype of the "Noble Savage" and the stereotypes of native american warriors, the Kaiser’s appreciation slowly turned from shallow, insensitive interest as an amateuer enthusiast into a measured and well-studied appreciation and knowledge of the various customs and histories of the First Peoples as he studied over the years, with the interest even passing on to some of his children. Though he has kept this taboo hobby a secret from much of the German government and his cabinet, His Majesty has reached out to our newly formed nation to both offer his appreciation for our nation and our people, and with an idea we have found to be almost irresistible: follow the German system of Constitutional Monarchism and crown a suzerin for the Wabanaki to guide our new people. He argues a single monarch would serve as a unifying figure in these turbulent times as we struggle to forge our own path in this new age. The question really has become not if we would accept his advice, as it has been met with resounding support throughout our council, but who should our new Monarch be named after. We could side with the traditionalists and nativists, who argue for Shay to take the name of his forefathers, or we could side the europeanist-camp, who seeks to name our heir apparent after the First Catholic Chieftain in all of North America, appeasing both the pro-German groups and the Catholic zealots. Whatever we decide, a new King shall soon rise to rule over the Dawnland, and in his hands lies our destiny."
WAB.2.a:0 "He shall take the name of his Forefather: Madockawando"
WAB.2.b:0 "He shall be named after the First Catholic Chief of North America: Henri"

WAB.3.t:0 "Alliance with the Church"
WAB.3.d:0 "With our new state marching forward and the arduous rebuilding and resettling of our old tribal lands well under way, the question of religion has bubbled to the surface, boiling out into conversations, arguments, and even brawls across the nation. Much of the violence has been instigated by the Neqotkuk Clique: a group of highly zealous Catholic militants and preachers primarily composed of indoctrinated Maliseet tribespeople and Jesuit priests. Led by Chief William Saulis, he and his disciples have challenged the rulings of our high council on many an occasion, ceaselessly clamoring for our confederacy to declare Catholicism as our state-enforced national religion. Deeming our currently-promoted native faith pagan, the Neqotkuk Clique and Saulis will seemingly stop at nothing to achieve their goal of a Wabanaki tribal band united under the holy light of the Lord Jesus Christ. Ultimately, it is up to Chief [WAB.GetLeader] to decide, with this choice possible deciding the future of our young state."
WAB.3.a:0 "I have a feeling that the Wolastoqiyik will have a brighter future with Fundementalist Catholicism"
WAB.3.b:0 "We will not cave to these zealots and their disrespect of our traditions"

WAB.4.t:0 "Imperial Wabanaki Army"
WAB.4.d:0 "With our budding friendship with the Kaiserreich growing day by day, our cabinet has agreed to allow our armed forces to accept the recent deal from Berlin. Seeking to establish a foothold in North America, the Kaiser’s armies have sent an offer to our capital that we simply can’t refuse: to allow Germany to send aid and establish training programs for our troops from the land of Prussian Professionalism itself in return for docking rights and preferential trade contracts with our markets. The Kaiserreich’s armies are the best in the world, proven so in the fires of the Weltkrieg, making it paramount that their officers be allowed into our bases and their supplies be allowed to be unloaded at our docks, making the deal a no brainer to accept. We will soon flood the St. Lawrence Seaway with trade convoys bound for Kiel to kickstart these programs at once. With the Kaiser’s own guiding our military build-up, there is no doubt we shall soon have an army worthy of the Red Man and our new-found independence." "We now have an Army that is very Prussian and we are starting to send Young Officers to Train in the Kaiserreich
WAB.4.a:0 "Open up full trade with Berlin, the Red Man has finally met some White Devils worth our time"

WAB.5.t:0 "Wabanaki Joining the Reichspakt?"
WAB.5.d:0 "A personalized letter has reached the desk of the Kaiser himself; its envelope adorned with a pair of feathers pressed into a wax seal embossed with the insignia of the Wabanaki Confederacy. The Chief of the noble Wabana'ki Mawuhkacik has reached out to the Kaiser, monarch to monarch, offering the deepest of gratitudes and the most sincere compliments, regalling the Kaiser with goodwill fitting only of an Emperor. Beneath the wordy pile of kisses to the hand delivered with a pen, the native Chief and King requested entrance into the Reichspakt as a full and equal member in both the economic bund of Mitteleuropa and the military alliance itself. With his words to gracious and silver tongued to resist, and catching the Kaiser on a good day, the request of the "Noble Savage" will be accepted, as the Kaiser begins to write his witty response in acceptance of this proud friend’s request."
WAB.5.a:0 "'...It is with the greatest of pleasure that I may accept your request at once...'"

WAB.6.t:0 "Uncivilized Barbarians"
WAB.6.d:0 "As the Pro-German elements of our administration tighten their talons around us further, and with their influence dominating both the national government and our armed forces, our administration has taken up the mantle of the unofficial defenders of European civilization here in the New World with the fall of Canada to the Red Man and the collapse of the United States into civil war. Holding the torch of the Kaiser’s light, and under the guiding force of our glorious monarch [WAB.GetLeader], the Wabana'ki Mawuhkacik stands as the last bastion of the civilizing luminance of the Old World. With this mantle comes the Kaiser’s support for our claim to all of Canada, the last major hold out of European culture in North America, should we seek to push it. Though it is probably for self-serving reasons, as the Kaiserreich has long sought to sneak its influence into North America, this may be our one and only chance to legitimately and successfully topple High Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner and his regime and establish Wabanaki and European supremacy back over the True North. Alternatively, betraying Chief Towner after he and his armies liberated the Red Man would be seen as a deeply deceitful act by many both in our local confederation and the wider Beringian Confederation population at large. Chief [WAB.GetLeader] must tread carefully in his choice, as the future of the People of the Dawn, and of the First Peoples as a whole, hangs in the balance."
WAB.6.a:0 "We ride into the heart of Beringia to topple to horrid regime of Chief Elwood Towner"
WAB.6.b:0 "We rather not incur the wrath of the man who saved our people"

WAB.7.t:0 "A new day dawns for the People of the Tide"
WAB.7.d:0 "The war cries and victorious chants of the First Peoples roar up the rocky cliff sides and jagged coasts of Western Canada once more as the banner of the Wabanaki and our imperial army fly high over the fjords and coves of Aani: the true name for these wild lands in the tongue of its native inhabitants. With training and supplies bestowed upon us from the Kaiser’s own superior officers and a steely and indomitable will to succeed, our forces have cut down the pretenders that ruled over these lands in a savage showcase of brutal efficiency and vengeful wrath. Once the homeland of our brothers and sisters of the Tlingit peoples, this craggy strip of land now stands cleansed of the taint of its previous occupiers. In the fighting, thousands of local Tlingit and Haida warriors rose up and assisted our troops in battle, helping turn the tide against the local defense forces stationed along the coasts and forests. In recognition of their bravery in the face of our shared enemy, Chief Saulis has moved to create a newly-autonomous zone along the coasts of Aani and the Haida Gwaii. Citing their strong cultural unity and identity as grounds for its creation and independence, this semi-sovereign state shall exist under the Crown of the Wabanaki as a free and (nearly) equal constituent chiefdom in the wider Wabanaki imperial system. This new state shall follow Tlingit tradition, being organized under matrilineal lines with a large emphasis on oratory knowledge, familial cooperation, and interconnectedness. Under the watch of the People of the Tide, these rugged lands shall no longer be disregarded or ignored as the true settlers of Aani make their way home once more."
WAB.7.a:0 "The lands of Aani once again echo with the sounds of a free people"

WAB.8.t:0 "Neqotkuk Coup"
WAB.8.d:0 "With our administrations refusal to bend to their will or accept their demands, the Neqotkuk Clique has moved to topple the increasingly pro-German government with Chief William Saulis seizing the reigns of power for himself. Launching guerilla strikes on multiple centers of control simultaneously, the religious fundamentalists crippled the ruling administration while the King tried, but ultimately failed, to flee into exile in Berlin. Luckily, the King was stopped and apprehended just before he boarded his plane and is now comfortably under house arrest, heavily guarded by Neqotkuk fanatics. As the King was forced into his cushy imprisonment, Neqotkuk militants continued their great raid, razing public offices and slaughtering Kraut officials without a second thought in their frenzy to cleanse the homelands of Hunnic pestilence. Fires raged across the Dawnland as monarchist lapdogs and religious disciples leapt at eachothers throats, destabilizing the region further with each scalp taken or neck slashed. In the chaos, the capital’s authority completely collapsed, allowing William Saulis and his rabid followers to finally seize power after days of bloody conflict. With Chief Saulis now at the helm, all can be sure that the Wabanaki Confederacy will begin to shift in radically different directions as it moves towards fanatical Catholicism and pro-French attitudes, blazing a new trail for the People of the Dawn."
WAB.8.a:0 "The Light of the Lord Jesus Christ has reached the shores of the Dawnland"

WAB.9.t:0 "The Aftermath"
WAB.9.d:0 "God above is our Lord and Chief William Saulis is our shepherd; with the guidance of these two teachers, the Wabanaki Confederacy has blossomed into a bountiful and jubilant grove. With the infusion of Catholic doctrine, goodwill, and wider culture into our way of life, the people of the Dawnland have never been more prosperous. In the light of the Lord Jesus Christ, we have found salvation and peace in our newly-won independence. Though our transformation so far has been drastic, it has merely been the first step. We have only just begun to integrate the Catholic ideals into our society, and our glorious new Chief holds many ideas to vault our nation into holy purity and greatness, flirting publicly with the ideas of integralism, syncretism, and religious primacy. Though only the Lord knows the future, our Chief Saulis has been seen to be near clairvoyant, and under his foresight the Wabanaki people shall march into a purer future."
WAB.9.a:0 "We are merely children of God, lambs to His Majesty"

WAB.10.t:0 "The Leptanet in Charge"
WAB.10.d:0 "Desiring to maintain stability and at least an air of legitimacy, Saulis has managed to hash out a deal with the imprisoned King. In exchange for his freedom and continued luxury, the King will function as a mere figurehead to the newly instated Leptanet William Saulis, with Leptanet being a Maliseet and Passamaquoddy word for Governor-General. With this arrangement, the public will still have their adored monarch to praise and unify behind while, behind the scenes, Leptanet Saulis will hold all the real power and call all the shots. Under this setup, the Wabanaki will move forward together, ever united, and now under the guiding luminance of God and the Catholic Church."
WAB.10.a:0 "Blessed are the Red Man, for they will inherit the Earth"

WAB.11.t:0 "Alliance with the Jesuits"
WAB.11.d:0 "First established in Canada during the time of William Champlain and his expeditions, and first reaching the natives with Champlain’s interactions with the Huron, French-Catholocism in the New World holds considerable sway in areas in which it still inhabits, and our territory is not exempt. Chief amongst the Catholic orders that influence and divine our lands is the Society of Jesus, more commonly called the Jesuits. Tracing their links back to Catholocism’s introduction to these lands, the Jesuits have recently exploded in popularity in our lands, mostly due to Leptanet Saulis’ proselytization and demagoguery, and as such have achieved quite the high perch in our society. To recognize and curb this influence, Leptanet Saulis has moved to officially align with the Society of Jesus, granting them full governmental powers and an official position in our administration. With the Jesuits standing as an legitimate arm of the government, as their power grows, as too shall ours, ensuring both their loyalty and our supremacy. Together we shall march towards destiny guided by God’s light."
WAB.11.a:0 "Our brothers in faith have served us well so far"

WAB.12.t:0 "Catholic Shamans"
WAB.12.d:0 "With the recent pushes for syncretism between the Catholic faith and the various native spiritual movements, many shaman, spiritual healers, and other men of the cloth in tribal communities across Wabanaki have begun to convert to Catholicism en masse. Choosing to merge and blend Catholic Church doctrine with indigenous beliefs, these ‘Catholic Motewolon’ have begun to quickly spread their new message, and with them follow their congregations. As they spread their syncretic faith, the power of Leptanet Saulis and the Neqotkuk Clique grow greatly as well. "
WAB.12.a:0 "With these motewolon’s teachings, the divide between our people thins as God’s light embraces us all"

WAB.13.t:0 "An old idea with a new twist"
WAB.13.d:0 "Leptanet Saulis' unique blend of ideas has culminated in the creation of what he calls "French-Wolastoqey Integralism." Based on the ideas of the ruling house of Portugal and the Action Française, Saulis envisions a Wabanaki Confederacy ruled in neo-feudalist, organic system of land-owning Chieftains holding large swaths of land and all subservient to the King and his Leptanet. Each Chieftain, as well as the King (and by extension the Leptanet) would have tribal vassals beneath them to further carve up the land for administration, with the villages, monasteries, and farming communes all contributing to their lording Chieftain of varying esteem and rank of nobility. A large emphasis will be placed on traditionalism, piety, and asceticism, as well as self-sufficiency with friendly cooperation when necessary, seeking to eliminate the flaws of inefficiency and isolation that plagued the White Man’s attempts at feudalist practices in centuries past. Inspiration would be drawn heavily to the aesthetic, practices, and culture of Medieval France, the Maliseet, and the Gothic past of the Catholic Church, all modernized and fused into a singular new ideology, and with it purging the last of our German and Townerite taint once and for all."
WAB.13.a:0 "A unique synthesis of culture and ideology for a unique synthesis of peoples"

WAB.14.t:0 "SAKOMAWI MALI"
WAB.14.d:0 "The golden age for our people seems to continue evermore, first led astray by the Kaiser who tainted our founding principles, and saved after our initial stumble by God’s Holy Light and the aid of the Order of Jesus. With the Jesuits and the Neqotkuk Clique guiding us, under the glorious rule of the Puppet King and our brilliant Leptanent Saulis, the Wabanaki have never been more prosperous. For the first time in centuries, not one of our people go hungry, nor does a single one live destitute or on the street. The People of the Dawn live proud and dignified, toiling and living a simple and pious life under God’s light. Our new Eden has progressed fantastically, and as we expunge all sin and work towards purity, we seek to repent for the great Original Sin as we create a Kingdom of God here on Earth. All heathens and infidels will face judgement, and all sinners smited, while the true believers shall feel nothing but the warm, loving embrace of the Lord. Under Saulis; under the Lord, we know we are righteous and we know we are true! We have seen God ourselves, and he is Red!"
WAB.14.a:0 "NIL PAPAHTOM! KIL MOCAHANT!"

WAB.15.t:0 "The Black Elk of the White Dove Makes a Visit"
WAB.15.d:0 "The Etchemin Confederacy has risen from the ashes of both the Canadian state and the Wabanaki Confederacy, carving out a new life for the Red Man in the Dawnlands. Breathing free air once more and with our new path under the Lord’s Light decided, the People of the Dawn and our allied tribes march hand in hand with the lord God above towards greener pastures. The journey to salvation is always an unknown one, and along the way comes many unexpected occurrences and miracles. One such occurrence has been the arrival of Heȟáka Sápa, or Black Elk, to our lands. Originally hailing from Great Plains and the brave people of the Oglala Lakhota, Black Elk is an well respected and well known wičháša wakȟáŋ, or “medicine man”, and linguist and historians for his people, a revered veteran of both Little Bighorn and Wounded Knee, and a devout Catholic missionary. With the rise of Beringia and Towner, Black Elk made his way to Alaska to serve in the grand confederacy of First People’s, and with the defeat of the Canadians and New Englanders, he has now gone about proselytizing the syncretic faith of Beringia across the True North and the returned lands of the First Nations. Hearing of our newly-risen religious state here in the Dawnlands, Heȟáka Sápa has come to our borders to continue his religious journey. Recognizing the opportunity immediately, [WAB.GetLeader] has moved to not only open our gates to this infamous holy man, but also to incorporate the mystic’s teachings directly into our administration. Recognizing his potential as a unifying beacon through which to spread our new Native American-inspired Catholicism, the Etchemin Confederacy shall ceremoniously elevate Black Elk to our highest spiritual position as the leader of our new class of Catholic Shaman. Acting as an Arch-bishop of the Catholic-Native faith and liaison between our fair nation and the Holy See in Rome, Black Elk will become the bridge between the Catholic and Indigenous faiths, linking the people of our nation together like never before. Though he will not reside in our fair state and shall continue his spiritual pilgrimage across the lands of the Red Man, Black Elk’s teachings and ideas will be left behind, fostering and educating our new order of Catholic Shaman for generations to come. Under [WAB.GetLeader] and with Arch-bishop Heȟáka Sápa’s teachings, the Dawnlands of the Etchemin Confederacy shall truly feel God’s light once and for all"
WAB.15.a:0 "The pinnacle of European and Amerindian syncretist belief has been realized! Even the Red Man shall have a place in the Holy See"

WAB.16.t:0 "A meeting between a Leptanet and a Chief"
WAB.16.d:0 "Deep within the decorated halls of Beringia’s capitol building, an imposing monolith fusing native aesthetics with modernist, art-deco architecture, two titans of the Red Man’s cause meet to discuss the future of the First Peoples. From the Wabanaki came Leptanet William Saulis, holy champion and honorable steward of the Dawnland to the east, who has arrived at our door to discuss a deal with the great Chief of Beringia. Citing their shared appreciation for religiosity and their adherence to the syncretic beliefs of both the New Word and the Old, Saulis has come with peace pipe in hand to offer the great Chief Towner an alliance. Fearing the rising ire of the outside powers that could threaten the indigenous of North America and their new found power, a great alliance of "enlightened" natives has been called for, creating a bulwark of spirituality and security for all of the Red Race to stand united and fearless behind. Fusing ideas both old and new, both foreign and domestic, and after many hours of debate, a new alliance of the Red Man had been declared. With the arguments and discussion out of the way, Chief and Leptanet shared hits from the peace pipe around the central hearth of the capitol building, sealing their bond and the union of arms between the Wabanakik and the Beringians."

POLITICS_MADOCKWANDO_DESC:0 "Born in 1924 in Bristol, Connecticut, Charles Norman Shay is both shockingly young and inexperienced in the world of statecraft, and yet he now rules over the Dawnlands as King of the Wabanakik. Though young, Shay possesses a strong warrior spirit and a keen intellect, both of which he constantly hones like one sharpens a fine knife’s edge. The ambitious and charismatic young leader seeks to further foster ties with his new friend in the Kaiser of Germany, and has moved to reform the Dawnlands into the image of the Kaiserreich. If his ambitions pan out remains to be seen, but under his rule, the People of the Dawn are hopeful to finally taste prosperity and dignity once more."
POLITICS_SAULIS_DESC:0 "Esteemed Chief of the Tobique nations and now ruler of all of Wabanaki, William Saulis has come a long way in his fight for native self-determination. Always a fierce opponent to the meddling of the White Man in native affairs, Saulis has built a career on organizing resistance and political pushback against the interference of his foes. This career came to a head with his coup against the Hunnic lapdogs that were poised to infect the Dawnlands forever. Toppling the old pro-German administration and subjecting the King to the position of a mere figurehead, the ever pious Saulis now moves to bring forth his own vision of the future: a future illuminated by God’s guiding light for all the People of the Dawn."

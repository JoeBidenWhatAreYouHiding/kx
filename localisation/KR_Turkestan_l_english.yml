The main idea behind the creation of such a party was a response to Russian colonialism and the idea that the national liberation movement of Turkestan did not end with the establishment of the Turkestan Republic, but was suppressed by pro-Russian forces - the Turkestan Military Organization, the Peasant Army and the government of Mustafa Shokay. The party's program, largely inspired by the ideas of the left SRs, seeks to build a just national Turkic state for the dehkans and workers of Turkestan.§!"

The program was dominated by conservative views on domestic affairs and women's issues. Although the Ittifoqi Muslimin does not have a clear hierarchical party structure, the generally recognized leader is the head of the Tashkent section of the party, Sherali Lapin, who also serves as party leader in the Khalq Majlisi of Turkestan.

Atabayev's party is closer to the Revolutionary Committee in terms of ideology, while Üsh-Jüz initially had Russophobic and pan-Turkic tendencies. Despite being socialist, Üsh-Jüz has retained nationalist slogans and a more neutral stance on supporting either of the main factions.

POLITICS_MUSTAFA_SHOKAY_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 25th, 1890, in Aulie-tarangil, Syr-Darya Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born into the esteemed lineage of a Kazakh aristocratic family, Mustafa Shokay emerged from the small aul of Aulie-tarangil, where the prosperity of his family was measured by the abundance of livestock. His mother, Bakty, a descendant of the illustrious Batu Khan, played a pivotal role in shaping Mustafa's intellectual prowess. Under her guidance, he mastered Kazakh, Arabic, and Persian. Guided by a local mullah, young Mustafa began his journey into the Islamic realm at the tender age of five. Devoted to his Islamic roots, Mustafa Shokay emerged as a democrat untouched by socialist fervor. With his fine nature, he epitomized a politician for peace, a statesman who cherished discussions and valued diverse perspectives. Some say that this idealism of the young man has faded after 16 years of attempts to lead the nation to a state of peace and unity - that Mustafa has casted colt's teeth, and his constant atempts to strike a balance between Jadidism and Qadimism, unity and diversity, autonomy and independence are just a clear sign he has become a pragmatist and a skillful diplomat. One thing is unclear - will the tranquil reformer he has been all these years save the country?"
POLITICS_TOROQUL_JANUZAKOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1893, in Taldy-Bulaq, Syr-Darya Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Toroqul Januzakov, born into the privileged feudal class of the Northern Kyrgyz people, enjoyed the benefits of a privileged upbringing that included access to quality education. His journey into the turbulent waters of Central Asian politics began as a translator in the Turkestan General-Governor's administration, where he engaged with the leading minds of the Russian intelligentsia. Active in the Central Asian revolt of 1916, Toroqul emerged as a prominent leader in the Kyrgyz-populated regions. His commitment to forging a new path continued in 1917 when he aligned himself with the Turkestan Soviet Republic. On his initiative, the Commission on Refugee Affairs was established, focused on supporting those affected by the 1916 uprising. Toroqul's advocacy secured substantial financial and material resources from post-revolutionary Russia to aid poor participants and facilitate the return of refugees from Xinjiang. As the chairman, Januzakov also played a pivotal role in investigating instances of Russian chauvinism's brutality toward the local Kyrgyz population. Notably, his efforts led to the execution of the perpetrators responsible for the horrific massacre of 537 unarmed Kyrgyz individuals in Belovodskoye during the 1916 uprising.\n\nEducated and intellectually astute, Toroqul began to question the alignment of the Turkestan Soviet leaders with the cause of national liberation. Recognizing the disconnect between their goals and genuine liberation, coupled with a realization that the ethnic Russian leadership was not fostering liberation but perpetuating exploitation, Toroqul Januzakov joined the Mujahideen movement against the Bolsheviks. Between 1919 and 1920, Toroqul participated in the movement alongside prominent figures like Parpi, Korshirmat and Madamin Bey. Simultaneously, Toroqul delved into scientific research, collecting folklore and conducting archeographic and ethnographic studies.\n\nPost-civil war victory, Toroqul Januzakov reunited with Akhmetzaki Velidi, a comrade since 1914, to establish the ERK socialist party. This collaboration marked the beginning of a significant chapter in Turkestan's political landscape, setting the stage for the emergence of the largest socialist association in the region, that eventually came to power, bringing Januzakov to a long-awaited position of nation's Minister-President."
POLITICS_TURAR_RYSKULOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 26th, 1894, in Besagash, Semirechye Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born into the nomadic herder Shymyr clan of the Kazakh Dulat tribe, Turar Ryskulov emerged as a prominent leader within the Turkestani socialist movement. Childhood friends with Toroqul Januzakov, Turar's journey began at the Merke Russian-Indigenous boarding school, where he and Toroqul studied together. After graduating from the Pishpek agricultural school in 1914, Turar continued his studies in Tashkent. In the summer of 1916, as the national-liberation uprising ignited in the Kazakh steppe, Turar Ryskulov left his studies to return to the village of Merke in Aulie-ata district. Although arrested by the tsarist administration during the uprising, Ryskulov was released due to the absence of evidence against him.\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917, Turar returned to Merke and was elected as the deputy chairman of the executive committee of the Aulie-ata district council. In April 1918, Turar dedicated his efforts to alleviating famine, regulating relations between Russians and Kazakhs, and promoting local representation in councils. Turar's leadership extended to organizing public catering facilities, feeding up to 20 thousand Kazakhs near Aulie-ata. Despite the challenges of famine, he focused on local initiatives and became People's Commissar of Health Care of the Turkestan Soviet Republic in September 1918. Tasked with fighting hunger, Ryskulov demanded the creation of a special organization, leading to the formation of a Central Commission, of which he became chairman.\n\nThe Soviet Republic's collapse prompted Ryskulov to distance himself from the Bolsheviks, emphasizing his local efforts to save the people. Forging a close alliance with Toroqul Januzakov, Turar Ryskulov transitioned into the ERK party after the Turkestan Civil War, becoming Januzakov's closest associate and deputy. Known for his intelligence, character, and pan-Turkist position, Turar Ryskulov remains respected and popular both in Semirechye and Turkestan."
POLITICS_NAZIR_TORAQULOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! October, 1892, in Kokand, Fergana Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born into a wealthy Kazakh family of a large cotton merchant, Nazir received his primary education in Kokand in the Jadid madrasa and \"Russian-Turkestan school\". In 1914-1916 he studied at the Economics Department of the Moscow Commercial Institute. During the Weltkrieg he served as an instructor in the Zemsoyuz (Committee of the Western Front of the Minsk and Baranovichi district), in Minsk he created a secret organization Society \"Free Steppe\", which united revolutionary-minded students and teachers.\n\nFrom February 1917 he was a Left SR, secretary of the Council of Workers', Soldiers' and Muslim Deputies in Kokand, chairman of the local Left SR organisation. While he became, in fact, one of the leaders of Soviet Turkestan, similarly to Turar Ryskulov, Toraqulov often traveled to various regions of this vast republic, trying to get into the essence of the problems arising before the new government; he spoke at various congresses, met with workers, Red Army and dekhkans at meetings and rallies. And from the very beginning he learned that one of the most important qualities of a people's leader is the ability both to listen to the voice of the masses and to be attentive to each person. His calm tone and unwavering political correctness created an environment in which visitors did not hesitate to literally pour out their souls to him. Unlike the majority of leaders who looked askew at religion after the establishment of Soviet power, Tyuryakulov thought about the influence of Islam on the history of mankind. During his years of service he tried to reach a reasonable compromise in the relations between the new authorities and religion. The fall of Soviet Turkestan and Bolshevist chauvinism towards local Muslim leaders has turned Toraqulov against the Bolsheviks. He joined the ERK party and led an internationalist wing in it, which demanded more radical changes to the apparatus of the re-established Republic of Turkestan. Now, elected as the new chairman of the ERK party, Toraqulov wishes to build a truly socialist, but Muslim-oriented national republic, which acknowledges the region's history and culture."
POLITICS_FAYZULLA_KHOJAEV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1896, in Bukhara, Emirate of Bukhara\n§YPolitical Career:§! Fayzulla Hojaev was born in Bukhara in the wealthy family of Uzbek millionaire merchants - one of the noble families of Bukhara - Qasim Sheikh's. He learned the Russian language on his own and studied in Moscow, also visited Germany during his business trip. Since 1913 he was involved in the Jadidist movement and became one of the leaders of the Young Bukhara party. He was one of the organizers of the demonstration in support of \"Manifesto\" of Emir Alim-khan with the announcement of democratic reforms. However, the demonstration was dispersed and Fayzulla was forced to flee from Bukhara. At the beginning of the 1917 Bolshevik Putsch in Russia, as a representative of the Revolutionary Committee, he participated in the so-called \"Kolesov events\" - a rebellion against the Emir of Bukhara. After the defeat of the uprising he fled to Turkestan and was sentenced to death by the Emir's government. On the way to Moscow he was arrested by the government of Ataman Dutov and imprisoned in the Orenburg prison. Receiving amnesty from Kerensky's government, he came to Tashkent, where he organized a bureau of Young Bukhara Revolutionaries, together with Usman Hoja and established ties with the revolutionary underground in Bukhara and supplied it with revolutionary literature.\n\nAfter the moderate wing of Young Bukhara was crushed in Bukhara, Fayzulla decided to act - and succeeded. With the fall of Emir's power, he managed to consolidate his position as the nation's first Prime-Minister. He is willing to radically change the country, that has seen little to no change reform for several centuries. Fayzulla is often called the \"Lenin of the Uzbeks\", though it is hard to tell whether this is a compliment or a curse. A small, wiry, and full of consuming energy, he enjoyed life, and could laugh gaily beneath a crushing load of work. He knows his people, is a great orator, and is much loved."
POLITICS_MUNAWWAR_ANDURRASHIDKHAN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1878, in Tashkent, Syr-Darya Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan was born into an intelligent Tajik family, and his rise from Quran reciter to a prominent figure in Turkestan politics was a testament to his unwavering commitment to reform and independence. In his early years, Munawwar devoted himself to mastering the science of recitation and Tajweed under the tutelage of Usman Domla, a renowned teacher of his time. He studied in the Yunuskhon madrasa in Tashkent and then in a madrasa in Bukhara. Although he did not complete his studies there, he returned to Tashkent and immersed himself in the role of imam and teacher. He founded the first reformed elementary school in Tashkent, which was the beginning of his contribution to the Jadidist movement. Munawwar Abdurrashidkhan's activities were not limited to education and journalism: he was active in political activities, advocating the study of European commerce, industry and science and denouncing spiritual backwardness. His stand against the colonial policies of Tsarism led to numerous arrests, emphasizing his dedication to the cause. The far-sighted leader played a key role in the Sho'roi Islamiyya organization, and after the war he co-founded the Milliy Ittihod party. His support for Turkestan's autonomy in 1917 reflected his lifelong dream of seeing his homeland independent.\n\nHowever, in recent years there has been a divergence between Munawwar Abdurrashidkhan's vision and that of Mustafa Shokay, the head of the party. With Shokay ousted and a minister-president in place, Munawwar faces perhaps his greatest challenge yet: maintaining unity in an increasingly unstable country struggling with incipient democracy. The delicate balance between tradition and modernity, independence and cooperation now rests on Munawwar's shoulders."
POLITICS_SHERALI_LAPIN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1868, in Qogalikol, Syr-Darya Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! The life and path of Sherali Lapin epitomizes a lifelong commitment to preserving Islamic values in the face of societal change. Sherali Lapin received a brilliant education and had a successful career: he graduated from the Turkestan teacher's seminary and worked in the profession as a teacher of Russian language, and then entered St. Petersburg to study law and opened an law office there. Lapin worked in the Samarqand regional court, and also accompanied on trips of high officials: the commander of the troops of the Turkestan Military District, the Minister of Railways of the Russian Empire. After his rejection as a candidate for the State Duma, Lapin engaged in scientific activity, participated in the compilation of dictionaries and delved into the study of historical monuments and folklore.\n\nThe revolutionary tide of 1917 brought Lapin to the leadership of the Sho'roi Ulamo party, which was a turning point in his life. After witnessing the defeat of the Kokand autonomy, he sought the support of Germany and Turkey in the struggle against the Bolsheviks, envisioning a German-Turkish protectorate in Turkestan and visited Berlin. Back in his homeland, Lapin observed the successes of the national liberation movement. In the face of the new rule of Shokay and Milliy Ittihod, Lapin remained a supporter of Qadimism, creating the Ittifoqi Muslimin movement to unite Islamic traditionalists. His strategic entry into the coalition government with Shokay demonstrated Lapin's acumen, eventually leading him to the position of minister-president of the country."
POLITICS_KATTA_ERGASH_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1882, in Bachkir, Fergana Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Little is known about Ergash-Kurbashi's early years. He served as a religious clergyman in Kokand and preached to 25,000 people during Friday prayers. Mullah Ergash participated in the siege of Kokand and fled to Bachkir after the fall of Turkestan autonomy. Ergash formed the first anti-Soviet resistance group, known as the Mirshabs. In the spring of 1918, all Fergana leaders recognized his leadership, and he became popular among the people. During the spring and fall of 1918, Ergash emerged victorious in all battles against the Red Army in Namangan and Kokand districts. A power struggle for leadership of the Mujahideen ensued between Ergash Bey and Madamin Bey, resulting in Ergash's defeat and the rise of the Provisional Fergana Government as the dominant body claiming power in all of Turkestan. Consequently, Madamin Bey led the Fergana mujahideen in late 1918 and early 1919. After the war, Ergash became the informal leader of the local Turkestan militia as an authoritative Kurbashi. In early 1936, the National Guard was created, and Ergash lost his position. He attempted to ban the Mirshab movement and later seized power in a bloodless coup. Ergash then began transforming Turkestan towards conservatism and Islamism."

Madamin Bey, also known as Muhammad Amin Ahmad Bey, started as the leader of the Margilan militia and chairman of the Muslim worker trade union. He initially led a detachment of Mirshabs from the locals of Margilan and later joined Ergash Bey's troops, fighting alongside them against the Red Army. A significant moment occurred when Madamin Bey and Konstantin Monstrov, who were previously adversaries, set aside their disagreements and collaborated against the Bolsheviks. They established the Provisional Ferghana Government jointly, with Madamin Bey serving as the leader and Monstrov as his deputy. This alliance successfully brought together different Mirshab detachments and anti-Bolshevik combatants in a synchronized endeavor against the Red Army. Madamin Bey demonstrated his diplomatic skills by forming alliances with the Emir of Bukhara and Junaid-Khan, the ruler of the Khanate of Khiva. The goal of this united front was to jointly combat the Red Army and liberate Turkestan from Russian influence. Although the Provisional Ferghana Government achieved military success, the political landscape shifted as a new government, supported by the democratic Russian leadership under the Jadidists and Mustafa Shokay, took shape.\n\nMadamin Bey declined to disarm his forces and chose to maintain control over the Ferghana region, asserting his leadership claim over all of Turkestan. As a warlord governing the Ferghana Valley, his unchallenged authority fostered confidence but also resulted in some corruption. Madamin Bey is a clever and resourceful leader who showed a readiness to use any means necessary to secure and strengthen his power."
POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_MONSTROV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1874, in Syzran, Simbirsk Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! With a shrewd gaze from dark eyes beneath thick brows, a prominent nose, and a distinctive Skobelev mustache framing his assertive mouth, presence of the \"Jalal-Abad Napoleon\", Konstantin Ivanovich Monstrov, commanded attention. Originally hailing from Simbirsk province and the son of a lay magistrate, Monstrov's journey led him to Syzran, where he married and raised three children. The pre-revolutionary period saw him as an office clerk and contractor, and by 1914, he owned a significant land plot in the Fergana Valley. When the winds of revolution swept through Turkestan, Monstrov found himself at the helm of the Peasant Army, protecting Russian settlers from Mujahideen raids. Initially aligned with the Soviet authorities and the Red Army, his allegiance shifted due to the Bolshevik government's anti-peasant policies. Faced with attempts to seize land from Russian settlers, Monstrov joined forces with the Mujahideen, particularly Madamin Bey, in a common struggle against Soviet power. The Peasant Army, under Monstrov's leadership, conducted successful battles, securing a vast territory in Turkestan.\n\nPost-war, he refrained from recognizing the authority of the Turkestan Republic, echoing the sentiments of his confederate Madamin Bey. His focus on the autonomy of Russian settlers and his role in resolving ethnic unrest solidified his position as a key figure in the region. However, beyond his warlord status in Jalal-Abad, Monstrov harbored ambitions that hinted at a broader influence and a desire for a role beyond that of a regional commander. The man with the \"Skobelev mustache\" and memorable countenance had set his sights on a more significant role in the politics of Turkestan."

Ivan Zaitsev was born into the family of a village teacher and gained recognition for his military achievements and loyalty to the Russian cause in Turkestan. He received his education at the esteemed Nikolaevskaya Academy of the General Staff and demonstrated exceptional leadership on the battlefields of the Weltkrieg, earning numerous commendations and ultimately achieving the rank of colonel. Zaitsev's career was significantly influenced by his involvement in Turkestan. In July 1917, he took charge of Russian troops in Khiva and played a vital role in the struggle against the Bolsheviks. He exhibited both military proficiency and diplomatic skill, forming partnerships with regional dignitaries like Junaid Khan and Madamin Bey, transforming erstwhile foes into committed allies against the Bolshevik menace. Despite facing obstacles such as incarceration and a bold escape, Zaytsev remained steadfast. After the passing of the previous leader of the Turkestan Military Organization (TVO), Zaytsev took on the role of leader and bolstered the organization's leadership. With his guidance, the TVO increased its efforts to challenge the new Turkestan government, providing support to the Provisional Fergana government and collaborating closely with Admiral Kolchak's agents.\n\nNow that Zaitsev is in power in all of Turkestan, there is no doubt that the region will once again come under full Russian control."
POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_OSIPOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1896, in Krasnoyarsk, Yeniseysk Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Konstantin Osipov's involvement in the mutiny that made him famous is the most significant aspect to mention. As a Left SR, he initially supported the Turkestan Soviet and played a crucial role in defeating the Turkestan autonomy in 1918, as well as disarming Zaitsev's detachment. It is worth noting that he became the military commissar of the Turkestan Republic at just 22 years old, which is a remarkable achievement. In 1919, Osipov led an armed mutiny against the Turkestan Soviet, which greatly influenced the victory of anti-Bolshevik forces in Turkestan. Osipov acted harshly and uncompromisingly during the mutiny, personally ordering the execution of prominent Soviet and Party workers captured by the mutineers at the outset of their armed rebellion. The rebellion successfully captured key facilities such as the Tashkent railroad workshops and the Fortress, marking a turning point in the conflict. He later established ties with the TVO and joined their ranks. Osipov's actions during the mutiny saved his life and earned him amnesty. Thanks to his efforts, the Turkestan Soviet was ultimately defeated in the same year.\n\nOsipov played a prominent role in the TVO leadership, alongside Ivan Zaitsev, the general whose detachment he had disarmed at the beginning of the civil war. However, some view Osipov only as an opportunist, willing to betray his supposed ideals to maintain personal power."
POLITICS_KORSHIRMAT_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1895, in Garbaba, Fergana Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Shir Muhammad-bek Gazi, also known by the nickname Korshirmat, led the life of a peasant and a mirab in his youth. He graduated from a madrasa in Margilan and is said to have taken an active part in the 1916 uprising, for which he was imprisoned. He was released after the revolution and soon joined the national liberation movement. He became known as one of the Kurbashi of the Fergana Valley, who fought against the Red Army together with Ergash Bey and Madamin Bey. However, he never received all the admiration for his struggle in comparison with Madamin Bey. Like the latter, he denounced the new Turkestan government of the Jadidists and initiated several uprisings in the Pamir mountains. He was never captured, and that's when he decided to formulate his own political movement based on faith and traditions. However, his view of Turkestan was much more radical than that of the Qadimists or even Madamin-Bey. In Murghab, a small town in the Eastern Pamirs, he became known as the local emir and soon turned the surrounding region into his own fiefdom. This power was unsatisfactory to him, for his ambitions lay far beyond it - to unite all Muslims in the new Caliphate. His \"Islamic Revolutionary Society\" became perhaps the only organized force of radical fundamentalists in all of Turkestan - while all other radical mujahideen leaders sought only personal wealth and power."

turkestan_railway_crisis.1.t: "Main Railroad Worshops Hit By Strikes"
turkestan_railway_crisis.1.d: "In the wake of economic turmoil and political unrest throughout Russia, the Central Asian Railway has been thrown into disarray. The Main Railroad Workshops in Tashkent, a crucial hub for the railway, is now paralyzed due to worker strikes. These strikes were incited by various groups, including the ERK party and Russophone socialist organizations. The situation has become critical, as the Russian Garrison stationed in New Tashkent has found itself isolated from Petrograd due to the disruption of communication lines. The Garrison has urgently requested our assistance in quelling the strikes to restore order and ensure the railway's functionality.\n\nHowever, within our government, there are differing opinions on how to approach this crisis. Our Ittifoqi Muslimin coalition allies, as well as oppositional ERK party members are calling for a bold move to disarm the Russian Garrison and regain control of New Tashkent, asserting our independence and authority. Such a move could have significant consequences for our relations with the Russian government. On the other hand, if we don't want to worsen our relations with the hegemon, we can assist the Russian Garrison in quelling the strikes."

turkestan_railway_crisis.2.d: "As the strikes in Tashkent have reached their peak, the situation became dire and it was the government's choice to assist the Russian Garrison. The orders were given, and the Turkestan National Guard was dispatched to Tashkent. Clad in their distinctive uniforms and bearing the red and blue emblems, they entered the Russian part of the city. The Turkestan National Guard, armed and ready, moved in to disperse the crowds. The workers resisted, chanting slogans of Turkestan's independence and socialist revolution. But the Guard's orders were clear, and in the end, the strikes were forcibly quelled. The Main Railroad Workshop fell back into the hands of the authorities, as the Russian Garrison resumed control of New Tashkent.\n\nRussia commended our cooperation, but within our nation, a growing sense of resentment began to take root. Qadimists and the ERK party saw us as compromising our autonomy for the sake of foreign interests. Furthermore, this move was heavily criticized by the Ferghana government."

turkestan_railway_crisis.3.t: "Collapse of the Coalition"
turkestan_railway_crisis.3.d: "The fragile coalition that held Turkestan together was unraveling, driven by Mustafa Shokay's decision during the worker strikes in Tashkent. As the 'wheedling the Russians' intensified the existing divisions between the Jadidists and Qadimists. The Qadimists, embracing a more traditional stance, broke away. This rupture plunged Turkestan into further chaos, with Qadimist leaders distancing themselves from the coalition they once helped forge. Mustafa Shokay's calculated gamble aimed at balancing Russian interests and internal autonomy backfired. Facing a pivotal choice, the government contemplated drastic measures, with whispers of abandoning democratic institutions for stability and control in the face of mounting chaos."
turkestan_railway_crisis.3.a: "The choice is yet to be made."

turkestan_railway_crisis.4.t: "ERK Calls for Strikes"
turkestan_railway_crisis.4.d: "The discontent had ripened into a full-blown crisis. The ERK party seized the moment to launch a revolutionary upheaval. Their call for an all-Turkestan strike resonated from Tashkent to Pishpek, uniting workers across ethnicities against perceived government oppression. The promise of equality and the rejection of Russian settlers' influence drew widespread support. Dehkan peasants, burdened by economic hardships and land inequality, fervently joined the cause. Riots erupted, demanding land reform and an end to their plight. The Turkestan Republic became a battleground of protests and agitation. As news of strikes and riots spread, Mustafa Shokay's government faced a formidable challenge. ERK's coalition, spanning diverse factions, threatened to dismantle the fragile stability painstakingly built."

turkestan_railway_crisis.5.d: "Korshirmat, the charismatic leader of the so-called Islamic Revolutionary Society, a Mujahideen force, settled in the East Pamir rugged terrain, has boldly declared the establishment of a rival government in the town of Murghab. In a fervent proclamation, Korshirmat advocates for a pan-Islamist Turkestan, united under the principles of Sharia and the Quran. The Mujahideen, gaining substantial support from local communities, pledge to restore their might, protect Islamic values, and liberate Turkestan from foreign influences. As their influence grows, recruiting passionate followers, they assert control over most of the East Pamir and even approaching the city of Osh."

turkestan_railway_crisis.6.d: "Turkestan, once a land of relative stability, has now plunged into the abyss of civil strife. The fragile peace that held the region together has shattered, with multiple factions vying for control.\n\nIn the heart of Turkestan, the city of Tashkent has fallen into the hands of the ERK party. Their calls for revolution have been answered, and they now wield considerable influence in the capital. To the east, Madamin Bey has made his move. His forces are converging on Kokand, determined to seize power and establish his vision of Turkestan's future. Kokand, once a bastion of resistance against him, is now the focal point of a bitter struggle. Meanwhile, in the city of Osh, Korshirmat and his Mujahideen have taken control. With their pan-Islamist agenda, they are determined to establish a new order, governed by their interpretation of Sharia law. The loyalist forces, aligned with Mustafa Shokay's government, are fortifying their positions in Kokand. They believe it is there they must make their stand, for the future of Turkestan hangs in the balance."

In response, the National Guard forces have recently arrived in Tashkent, where the strikes paralyzed the life of city more and more and the tensions have drastically increased. As the Garrison's refused to disarm, the strikers call for decisive action against the Russians.

turkestan_railway_crisis.8.d: "The tension in New Tashkent had erupted into a full-blown crisis. The unyielding Russian Garrison, adamant in their refusal to disarm, found themselves in escalating confrontations with our government. The ominous presence of the National Guard stationed nearby added to the volatility of the situation, as the Garrison has accused us of violating the agreements\n\nThe incident unfolded on a scorching afternoon during a routine patrol by Russian soldiers. Intended as a display of strength, the patrol took an unexpected turn in a crowded market square. A verbal dispute escalated into physical clashes, turning the lively marketplace into a chaotic battleground. Local residents, aligned with our cause or the striking workers, rushed to confront the Russian soldiers. The situation quickly escalated from scuffles to armed clashes, with shots ringing out and chaos engulfing the streets of Tashkent.\n\nThe fierce and bloody confrontation persisted for hours, resulting in casualties on both sides and instilling fear and panic among the civilian population. Our loyal troops, stationed just outside the city, received frantic reports of the violence. Swiftly moving in to protect our citizens' interests, they intensified the fighting upon reinforcement. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the echoes of gunfire gradually faded, replaced by the wails of the wounded and the anguished cries of those who had lost loved ones. Tashkent had become a city scarred by violence and hatred."

turkestan_railway_crisis.9.t: "Aftermath of the Incident"
turkestan_railway_crisis.9.d: "The violent clashes in Tashkent spread beyond Turkestan and attracted the attention of the Russian government. Reports of the fierce confrontation between the Russian garrison and the National Guard quickly reached the corridors of power in Petrograd and caused a swift and unambiguous reaction.\n\nRussian diplomats, acting on behalf of the government, delivered a stern message to Mustafa Shokay's administration. The message contained both condemnation and a clear threat: the Turkestan incidents were seen as a direct challenge to Russian power in the region. Russia demanded immediate action to respect the agreements and restore order, warning of the dire consequences of non-compliance.\n\nIn response, the Shokay government faced a critical situation. The choice was stark: seek a diplomatic solution by cooperating with the Russian garrison to potentially ease tensions, or to finish what we started and restore our sovereignty."
turkestan_railway_crisis.9.d2: "The violent clashes in Tashkent went unnoticed by the Russian government. Reports of the confrontation between the Russian Garrison and the National Guard reached the highest echelons of power in Petrograd. However, there was no response from Russia...\n\nLeaving the Garrison to its fate, the Russians are likely to lose all of their control over Turkestan now. The decision has been made - we must finish what we started and restore our sovereignty"

His proposal outlined the following terms: both the Russian Garrison and Turkestan's National Guard should coordinate their efforts to maintain peace and stability in Tashkent. In the event of an open conflict involving other factions within Turkestan, the Russian government would pledge military support to Shokay's government. And, furthermore, the Russian Garrison will be disarmed and withdrawn from Tashkent in exchange for Turkestan becoming closely aligned with Russia.

turkestan_railway_crisis.12.d: "Mustafa Shokay attempted to resolve the conflict with the Russian Garrison diplomatically, but unfortunately, his efforts failed. The Russian authorities were not willing to accept the terms and instead threatened with immediate military intervention, leading to a rapid escalation of tensions in Tashkent, as the Russian Garrison faced a grim fate. Not only were they disarmed, but they were also subjected to a brutal and relentless assault. Reports of the massacre of the Russian Garrison reached the highest diplomatic echelons, sparking outrage and condemnation from foreign governments. The incident had brought Turkestan to the brink of a full-scale war with Russia, a situation the nation could not afford amidst its internal strife. However, the situation remained precarious because Madamin Bey had taken control of the entire Central Asian Railway, a strategic asset that could tip the balance of power in his favour. As the crisis deepened and the world watched, Turkestan now stood on the brink of an uncertain and perilous future."
turkestan_railway_crisis.12.a: "It was dire to count on Russia."

turkestan_railway_crisis.13.t: "A Fragile Peace"
turkestan_railway_crisis.13.d: "Surprisingly, Russia accepted the conditions outlined by Mustafa Shokay and signed the so-called Tashkent Accords. The agreement, hailed by some as a step towards peace and stability, would have significant implications for the future of Turkestan.\n\nAccording to the accords, the Russian Garrison cited solidarity with the "legitimate government of Turkestan" and prepared to withdraw from Turkestan, allowing Shokay's forces to take control of the previously contested New Tashkent. Although the populace celebrated this apparent display of Shokay's strength, the situation was far more complex. The Russian government's influence and pressure on Turkestan had increased significantly following the accords. Mustafa Shokay found himself in a precarious position, balancing Turkestan's internal and external dynamics as they continued to evolve."

turkestan_railway_crisis.14.t: "The Railway War"
turkestan_railway_crisis.14.d: "Decisive actions to disarm the Russian garrison had swift and disappointing consequences. The National Guard was able to occupy most of New Tashkent, taking control of key buildings, the telegraph and the post office, and even disarming some of the garrisons. However, it didn't end there. Most of the garrison, having transferred to armored trains, went by rail to Samarqand, and rumors quickly spread that the garrison was going to kill Muslims. Tashkent came under our full control, but the chaos was just beginning. The lack of control over part of the territories led to the fact that Madamin Bey also decided to act, declaring our government helpless in the fight against the Russian threat. Heavily armed Mujahideen under the leadership of Madamin Bey managed to ambush the Russians, and killed them all, also intercepting armored trains.\n\nAnd although the garrison was finished, and we managed to regain full control of our railways, there remained a more terrible threat - now Madamin Bey had openly challenged our government and it was necessary to end this threat once and for all."

turkestan_railway_crisis.15.d: "It was necessary to decide what to do with the Interim Ferghana Government. A number of our advisers have proposed to resolve the matter through peaceful negotiations and try to put Madamin Bey under their control. The Ittifoqi Muslimin party offered mediation in the negotiations, but the more radical advisers had another option - to prepare an armed attack on the dominance of the Mujahideen and destroy them by force. Something that our government has been unable to do for a very long time."

Together with him, intermediaries from the Ittifoqi Muslimin party set off on their way. However, upon arrival in Ferghana, it turned out that Madamin Bey did not even intend to start negotiations. Magdi Chanyshev and the intermediaries were killed right in the city. The news was shocking to the government. Now it became obvious that Madamin Bey was just a criminal, not ready for honest rules. In response to his crime, we must defeat the enemy immediately. Our Qadimist partners were also shocked by the murder of their representatives and stated that they were ready to support our government in any case."

Today in Kokand, the Provisional Ferghana Government, through the mediation of the Ferghana Peasant Army, restored justice and the shameful government was dispersed. Power in the country will be returned to the people as soon as we deal with other enemies of Islam and Turkestan.\"\n\nThis is exactly how, verbatim, a message from the new government of Turkestan was transmitted on radio stations today. The government, which has been fighting for the freedom of Turkestan since 1918. And despite what its leader, Madamin Bey, said, there were still dissenters in the country. This coup will not lead to peace, and the ERK party has already stated that it does not recognize the coup."

turkestan_railway_crisis.18.d: "The recent week in Tashkent has seen major strikes by both the non-Russian and some socialist-minded Russian workers of the Main Railroad Workshops of the Russian-controlled Central Asian Railway. As the major hub of the railroad, Tashkent was divided between the New and Old City, with the New City under the control of Russian Garrison as part of our agreements with the government of Turkestan.\n\nUnfortunately for us, the government of Turkestan refused to intervene in the situation, leading to a fierce conflict between the strikers, Garrison and bandit troops of Madamin Bey, a local warlord from Fergana valley, who claims to be the legitimate ruler of all Turkestan. The situation quickly descended into complete chaos with lots of victims. Our diplomats suggest that, despite the lack of resources, we must demand immediate intervention of the legitimate Turkestan government on behalf of the Russian Garrison to stabilize the situation both in New Tashkent and the Central Asian Railroad."

The Kyrgyz population, led by Abdykerim Sydykov and supported by a branch of the Alash party, saw the chaotic times as a chance to establish their autonomy, despite previously cooperating with Milliy Ittihod. As the Turkestan Republic struggled with internal strife and external threats, Pishpek declared its independence and broke away from the central government. The decision was heavily influenced by [ALO.GetName], which had offered its guarantees to the unrecognized state. Despite protests from Shokay's government, which asserted that this was an internal matter, Pishpek's declaration of independence stood.

The advisers from the Peasant Army faction of our government suggested to the new leader of Turkestan a bold, lightning-fast assault, using speed and surprise as weapons. The conservative loyalists believed that the best approach to success was a diplomatic offer to Korshirmat. This would likely secure the alliance of our governments against the socialists in Tashkent."

United, they approached Tashkent, the industrial heartland and political bastion controlled by ERK. The echoes of diplomacy reverberated through the ancient walls of Samarqand.  The journey to Tashkent was uncertain. It could either solidify the fragile alliance or plunge Turkestan into further chaos. The forces gathered in the streets of Samarqand were a union of traditionalist fervor and pan-Islamist determination. The joint forces recognized the complexity of Tashkent's urban sprawl and ERK's entrenched positions, leading to a temporary stalemate. To consolidate their control, they can focus on Samarqand, Fergana Valley, and the Pamir Mountains instead of launching a frontal assault. Meanwhile, Madamin Bey and the Mujahideen, fueled by their alliance's momentum, can attempt to advance towards Tashkent. Using their combined strength, they aim to aggressively assault ERK's stronghold. The joint forces will clash with ERK in the battle-hardened streets of Tashkent to dismantle their grip on power."

The fortified Tashkent, the largest city in the region, remained in the hands of the socialists of the ERK, who had already announced that the revolution had been accomplished and that people's rule would be established throughout Turkestan. This will hardly help them, however. The provisional Fergana government finally came to power after decades of waiting and deception by the Jadidist tricksters.\n\nNow, however, there seem to be more problems. The alliance with the Mujahideen has already seriously affected the mood among the Fergana Peasant Army and their leader, Konstantin Monstrov, Madamin Bey's deputy. It seems that now the fragile peace has become even more fragile, and until Korshirmat and Monstrov are openly at each other's throats, it is Madamin Bey who will be responsible for restoring a united Turkestan under his own rule."

The battle became chaotic and desperate as they fiercely assaulted the Turkestan Legion forces entrenched in the city. The ERK's defenses proved resilient and urban warfare favored the opposing forces. Despite early victories, Madamin Bey's troops became trapped in a network of narrow streets. The planned coordination between Madamin Bey and the Korshirmat's Mujahideen fell apart in the face of fierce resistance from the ERK. Furthermore, the socialists saw an opportunity and launched a counteroffensive both in Tashkent and in Fergana valley.\n\nThe alliance between Madamin Bey and Korshirmat, which had promised to unite Turkestan, had dissolved. In the midst of the chaos, Korshirmat's forces in Tashkent faced betrayal from within. Elements sympathetic to the ERK turned against the Mujahideen, sowing discord and confusion in their ranks. Madamin Bey's troops retreated, battered and discouraged, as they faced defeat on all fronts. Realizing the futility of further resistance, Korshirmat retreated to the mountain refuge of the Eastern Pamirs. The ERK emerged victorious, now in control of Tashkent, Kokand, and most of Turkestan. However, the scars of the civil war remained, leaving behind a divided nation."

Despite initial gains, Madamin Bey's forces faced heavy casualties, and Samarqand fell under ERK's dominance. While ERK battled against Madamin Bey's assault, the Mujahideen launched an offensive to conquer the city of Fergana. The forces of Korshirmat have flooded into Fergana Valley, capturing key cities and tightening the noose around Kokand, Madamin Bey's last stronghold. As the city's defenses crumbled, Madamin Bey was taken captive. The execution of Madamin Bey's confederates sealed the fate of his government, while the fate of Madamin Bey himself was to be decided later.

With both ERK and Mujahideen eyeing the city, the Federal government could only acknowledge the vulnerability of the Fergana Valley and consolidate our recent conquest.

Turkestan found itself at a critical crossroad, torn between national-liberal organizations and predominantly ethnic-Russian Soviets. On November 28, 1917, the All-Turkestan Qurultai of Muslims was convened under the leadership of the liberal-democratic Sho'roi Islamiya party. Turkestan Autonomy was proclaimed as part of the Federal Russia.\n\nHowever, the young state faced immediate challenges, marked by a fierce confrontation between various political currents involved in its formation, most notably between the Jadidists and Qadimists. As the influence of the Qadimists gained momentum, it led to the resignation of the first premier, Tynyshpayev, followed by the overthrow of the second preimr, Shokay, in February 1918. The clash between these forces laid the foundation for an impending civil war that threatened the stability and future of the newly born republic."

turkestan.202.t: "The Fall of Bolshevik Power in Turkestan"
turkestan.202.d: "In the summer of 1918, the Turkestan Soviet Republic found itself cut off from Soviet Russia as the flames of the Civil War engulfed the region. Isolated and facing numerous challenges, the once-dominant Bolshevik methods proved ineffective in maintaining control over Turkestan. The failure of Soviet Russia to provide much-needed support left the region vulnerable, and those opposing the regime began to seize the opportunity to strengthen their forces.\n\nDuring the Askhabad Mutiny, a Trans-Caspian Provisional Government emerged, backed by the British mission, further weakening the grip of the Bolsheviks. This newfound opposition found allies in various quarters. In November 1918, the Fergana Peasant Army, led by Monstrov and comprising volunteer units of peasant settlers, rallied against the Bolsheviks in Jalal-Abad. In Tashkent, in January 1919, a rebellion orchestrated by the military commissar Osipov resulted in the loss of many lives of Soviet workers.\n\nAs the year progressed, opposition forces united against the Bolsheviks. The Peasant Army, Madamin Bey Mojahedin, and the Semirechye Army Cossacks joined hands, culminating in the formation of the Provisional Fergana Government. The relentless resistance led to the eventual overthrow of Bolshevik power in Turkestan. The Provisional Fergana Government, in a moment of historic significance, declared the restoration of the Turkestan Republic and the end of the oppressive dictatorships that once held sway over the region."

turkestan.1.t: "Ever-Present Crisis"
turkestan.1.d: "After a bloody civil war between pro-Bolshevik Turkestan Soviet Republic and various anti-Soviet military units and organisations ended in 1920, the Turkestan Federative Republic emerged, following agreements between Russia and the Provisional Fergana Government - largest and most influential quasi-state in the region. The restoration of the Minister-President's office saw a liberal reformer Mustafa Shokay taking the helm, accompanied by the establishment of a parliamentary body known as the Khalq Majlisi and the formation of a new government. Despite these efforts, Russia's control over Turkestan proved untenable, leading to the eventual withdrawal of Russian troops from most of the region, except for the Tashkent Garrison..\n\nUnder Mustafa Shokay's leadership as Minister-President, the Republic of Turkestan attempted to navigate the complexities of a country grappling with internal problems. Despite its liberal-leaning regime in comparison to its neighbor, the Emirate of Bukhara, the Turkestan Federative Republic faced mounting challenges that threatened its stability.\n\nFor the past 16 years, Shokay has struggled to hold together a nation on the verge of disintegration. A fragile coalition government between the Jadidists and Qadimists has been fraught with internal dissent, and in the East Pamir, a Mujahedeen uprising has erupted, adding to the nation's woes. On another front, the Pan-Turkist socialist movement 'ERK' is gaining popularity, further complicating the political landscape."

turkestan.204.t: "Rival Governments of Turkestan"
turkestan.204.d: "Although to the outside eye it would appear that power in Turkestan belongs to the legitimate government of Mustafa Shokay, the reality is more complex. Indeed, the government, based in the ancient city of Kokand, is a symbol of balance and compromise. Now Mustafa Shokay's government is a coalition, an intricate dance between Jadidist reformists and Qadimist traditionalists. It is a fragile alliance born out of necessity amid the chaotic turmoil of the Turkestan Republic. Mustafa Shokay, a pragmatic and experienced diplomat, believes that only by bridging the split between Jadidists and Qadimists can Turkestan find stability. He envisions a republic that adheres to democratic values and respects the rights of its diverse population. Shokay's main goal is to prevent Turkestan from disintegrating.\n\nAlthough the government formally controls most of Turkestan, there are areas beyond its reach. Less than a hundred kilometers from Kokand lies the city of Fergana, the heart of the Fergana Valley. Power in the city and the entire valley since the civil war belongs to the Provisional Fergana Government, the true winners of the war, who achieved Turkestan's independence with arms in their hands, not for the Russians to \"put Shokay in charge\". Madamin Bey reigns supreme in the valley - his vision is in stark contrast to Shokay's pragmatic coalition. A pragmatic but authoritarian leader, he believes Turkestan needs a firm hand to restore order and assert its independence. Madamin Bey's main goal is to consolidate power over the entire region, free itself from outside influence and unite Turkestan under centralized authority. In his view, this was the only way to achieve stability and end the chaos that had engulfed the country.\n\nIn the rugged terrain of the East Pamir, Korshirmat and his Mujahideen adhere to their own vision for the future of Turkestan. Their vision is rooted in Islamic principles and calls for adherence to Sharia law as they consider themselves the guardians of the faith. Korshirmat's goal is clear: to create an Emirate of Turkestan where Islamic laws and principles will prevail. He believes in the power of religion to unite the various peoples of the region under a common banner of faith.\n\nHowever, this is not a far cry from the power struggles throughout Turkestan. In the bustling streets of Tashkent and other industrial centers, the population prefers to see the socialists of the ERK in power, while the Russian peasants who came to Turkestan under Stolypin's program support Konstantin Monstrov's Peasant Army. In addition, the clandestine Turkestan Military Organization, which dreams of bringing \"Russian civilization\" back to this \"frontier lands\", also claims power."

turkestan.203.t: "Turkestan Military Organisation"
turkestan.203.d: "In February 1918, the Turkestan Military Organization (TVO) emerged as a clandestine anti-Bolshevik group, founded by former officers of the Tsarist army, Russian intellectuals, and former officials. Nicknamed the White Guard of Turkestan, the TVO played a significant role in defeating the Bolsheviks during the Turkestan Civil War. The organization received active assistance from foreign intelligence agents, primarily the British, with figures like Wilfred Malleson and agents operating under the guise of foreign diplomatic missions accredited in Tashkent under the Soviet government.\n\nMembers of this underground organization established connections with Ataman Dutov, General Denikin, Alash Orda Kazakhs, the Emir of Bukhara, leaders of Fergana and Turkmen Mujahideen, Transcaspian White Guard forces, and English consuls in Kashgar, Kulja, and Meshed. Konstantin Osipov, a former Bolshevik who staged a rebellion against his own in January 1919, the peasant army of Konstantin Monstrov, and the Madamin Bey's Mujahideen - all became mere pawns in the cunning game of the Turkestan Military Organization.\n\nThe leader of the organization, Pyotr Kornilov, brother of the Russian military commander Lavr Kornilov, though perished, leaving a power vacuum within the organization. In this void, Osipov and Zaitsev, former ideological opponents, joined forces for a common goal, gaining the upper hand.

Kokand is the seat of power for Mustafa Shokay's government, while Fergana is the stronghold of Madamin Bey's Provisional Fergana Government. Tension is high as the upcoming Turkestan Derby is not just a football match, but a reflection of the larger struggle for Turkestan's soul - two teams from Kokand and Fergana are preparing for a sport battle. Fans have flooded the streets of Tashkent, and the cheers and chants reverberated through its streets.\n\nThe match commences with the referee's whistle. On the field, 22 athletes vie for victory. However, the true competition occurs in the hearts and minds of the spectators.  Every pass, tackle, and goal carries significance beyond the realm of sports. Although one team emerges as the winner when the final whistle blows, the scoreline fails to alter the convictions of those who witnessed the game. The Turkestan Derby left a deep divide, but for a brief moment, the power of sport brought people together. Turkestan is now a country where football represents more than just a sport.

turkestan.206.d: "Nestled amidst the rugged mountains and pristine valleys of the secluded region of East Pamir, life carries on at its own pace.  This remote part of the nation has always maintained an air of autonomy, isolated from the political machinations of the Turkestan Republic. East Pamir comprises scattered settlements, with the town of Murghab being the most prominent among them, serving as a bastion of local governance. The locals were renowned for their self-sufficiency, with each community following its own customs and traditions. Among them, Korshirmat, a charismatic and passionate leader, had risen to prominence. Recently, rumours had started to spread throughout the area about a new organisation, that was formed to promote pan-Islamism, while others thought it was a response to the secular policies of the Turkestan Republic. There were differing opinions about the nature of the organization. Although tensions in East Pamir remained localised for now, there were murmurs that this remote corner of Turkestan might become the spark that ignited a larger conflict, with the radical Islamists at the centre of it all. The delicate balance in this isolated region appears to be on the brink of transformation, and the effects of this change could extend beyond the rugged peaks of East Pamir."

turkestan.207.t: "The Birth of the National Guard"
turkestan.207.d: "In Turkestan, some argue that power was always fragmented and regional allegiances held sway. Therefore, the idea of a centralized and state-controlled armed force had long remained elusive.  Local militias, often doubling as law enforcement, known as Mirshabs, maintained an uneasy peace throughout the land. These units, led by various influential figures, including Ergash Bey, historically pledged their loyalties to different factions within the republic. Ergash Bey, a staunch advocate of Qadimist principles, commanded a considerable following within the Mirshab units. His affiliation with the Ittifoqi Muslimin raised concerns about the militias' loyalty to the Turkestan Republic. On the other hand, other armed groups had emerged.\n\nThe Turkestan Legion, a paramilitary branch of the ERK party, aimed for radical change and socialist transformation. Korshirmat's Mujahideen, representing pan-Islamist ideals, were strong contenders, especially in the eastern regions of the country. Under the banner of Madamin Bey, loyal forces rallied, including the Fergana Peasant Army of Russian settlers. In this complex landscape, the government recognized the need for a force that could provide stability and loyalty to the state. In a bold move, Mustafa Shokay issued a decree establishing the Turkestan National Guard, an armed force dedicated to defending the interests of the republic and ensuring its sovereignty. With the birth of the National Guard, Shokay seeks to create a cohesive and disciplined force that operates in the service of the entire nation, rather than factional interests."
turkestan.207.a: "Anyway, is there a nation without an army?"

turkestan.208.t: "The Railroad and Tashkent Condominium"
turkestan.208.d: "The construction of railroads in Central Asia established strong connections between the interior of Russia and the vast lands of Turkestan, breathing life into the agricultural sector, spurring the textile industry, and integrating the region into the all-Russian market. The Central Asian railroad system was crucial for trade and commerce, but it also played a significant role in the Turkestan civil war.  Control of the railroad arteries was strategically important during the conflict, as they determined the movement of troops and goods. Therefore, the railroad became a valuable asset in the midst of unrest.\n\nFollowing the end of the conflict, Russia and the Turkestan Republic signed a treaty that officially recognized the latter's independence. However, the city of Tashkent, which was the most important junction of the Central Asian railroad, was officially divided. Old Tashkent's majority Muslim neighborhoods were under the administration of the Turkestan Republic, while New Tashkent, with a predominantly Russian population, was governed by a Russian garrison within its boundaries. Essentially, the neighborhood acted as an extension of the Russian government. Beyond Tashkent's city limits, the vast Tashkent region became a diplomatic condominium. Representatives of the Turkestan Republic and the Russian garrison worked together, and sometimes had conflicts, to manage the region's affairs within this territory.\n\nThe most significant outcome of these agreements was the control of the Central Asian railroad. The Russian government took control of this complex network of tracks and terminals, with a garrison in Tashkent overseeing compliance with the treaty. This control allowed them to tightly regulate trade and logistics, effectively influencing the economy and politics of the entire region. For the various internal factions competing for influence in Turkestan, control of the railroads remained a powerful symbol of true independence. Many believed that only by regaining control of vital transportation arteries could Turkestan achieve full independence. The struggle for dominance over the Central Asian Railroad would determine the fate of the Turkestan Republic and the extent of its sovereignty in the years to come."

turkestan.209.d: "Turkestan has historically been a thriving economic hub, with its prosperity closely linked to the Silk Road. Trade routes spanning across Central Asia converged within our borders, allowing our merchants to exchange goods with distant lands. However, the stability of the Russian ruble, which is crucial to Turkestan's economic health, began to falter. The once-steady value of the ruble was now eroding rapidly. Prices soared higher each day as merchants and traders struggled to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of imports. Goods that had once been readily available became luxuries few could afford. As economic uncertainty spread throughout the land, businesses closed their doors and once bustling marketplaces now stood desolate. Mass unemployment plagued the republic as companies faced insurmountable losses. The cost of living has increased significantly, and people are lining up outside stores that still have goods to sell.

turkestan.210.t: "Navigating the Crisis"
turkestan.210.d: "The economic crisis in Turkestan has presented a significant challenge to our leaders, requiring them to make difficult decisions. To stabilize the economy, the government may choose to implement strict austerity measures. These measures involve reducing public spending, cutting subsidies, and implementing higher taxes. Although this approach may cause short-term difficulties for citizens, it is considered a prudent way to restore fiscal responsibility and encourage foreign investment. However, it may also trigger protests and civil unrest due to the harsh economic conditions imposed on the population.\n\nAlternatively, the government can provide direct economic relief to its citizens to safeguard their well-being during these turbulent times. This can be achieved through subsidies, food aid, and temporary financial assistance, which aim to alleviate the immediate suffering of the population. While this approach may gain support from the people and quell social unrest, it could strain the government's resources and lead to long-term economic challenges. The government can encourage self-reliance and diversification of trade by investing in local industries, promoting agricultural self-sufficiency, and seeking alternative trade partners beyond Russia and [KHI.GetName]. This approach aims to reduce the republic's dependence on the Russian economy and work towards long-term economic resilience. Although it may take time to yield results, it is a more ambitious and sustainable choice."

The bustling streets of Tashkent had transformed into a tableau of dissent, as citizens from all walks of life protestes with demands of \"Bread and jobs!\". In Samarqand, the unrest was equally palpable. The government faced a difficult decision: where to deploy its forces to suppress the unrest, in Tashkent or Samarqand, given the limited resources of the small National Guard. This decision would have profound consequences for the nation's future."
turkestan.211.a: "Focus on Tashkent riots."
turkestan.211.b: "We need stability in Samarqand."

turkestan.212.t: "A Nation on the Brink"
turkestan.212.d.intro: "Tashkent, the largest city in Turkestan, was at the center of a growing storm of protests. Mustafa Shokay faced a precarious situation that required a grave decision."
turkestan.212.d: "$turkestan.212.d.intro$\n\nPresident Shokay carefully weighed the implications. The city housed the Russian Garrison, a hub of Russophile sentiment, making it a potential powder keg. The ERK party had a strong presence in Tashkent, and there were whispers of the Turkestan Military Organisation presence. Suppressing dissent in Tashkent could potentially quell these hotbeds of opposition. The government's decision was to focus on suppressing the turmoil in Tashkent. Mirshabs and National Guard units were mobilized with precision. The streets of the capital witnessed clashes between the authorities and those demanding change. The government maintained its grip on Tashkent."
turkestan.212.d2: "$turkestan.212.d.intro$\n\nPresident Shokay considered the implications of his decision. Samarqand, a city deeply rooted in Jadidist culture, had limited influence from external factions. Its people, for the most part, supported Shokay's party. Suppressing the unrest here would maintain a stronghold in the heartland of Turkestan and send a strong message that the government stood by its supporters. With a heavy heart, Shokay chose to suppress the turmoil in Samarqand. Mirshabs and National Guard units were quickly deployed. and the protesters were met with force."
turkestan.212.a: "The choice was made."

turkestan.213.t: "The Weight of Sacrifices"
turkestan.213.d: "In these challenging times, President Shokay faced a difficult decision that required immediate sacrifices for the sake of long-term economic resilience. As the government tightened its budget, the people of Turkestan felt the impact. While government spoke of future prosperity, the present reality was marked by job losses and economic uncertainty. Factories that were once bustling with activity now stand silent. In teahouses and bazaars, conversations are filled with stories of neighbors and friends becoming unemployed. Trade disruptions, caused by the government's measures, added to their daily struggles. Turkestan's markets were in flux as imported goods became scarcer and prices soared. Shelves that once held a variety of foreign products now displayed empty spaces. Business owners and traders also struggled with the changes. Trade routes that had long sustained Turkestan's commerce were suddenly severed or altered, forcing them to adapt to new realities."
turkestan.213.a: "They will feel the change soon."

turkestan.214.t: "A Helping Hand in Troubled Times"
turkestan.214.d: "In these challenging times, President Shokay made a solemn promise to his people. In the face of economic turmoil and growing unrest, his government has implemented subsidies to lower the cost of essential goods, ensuring that even the most vulnerable citizens can afford daily necessities. Markets that were once empty are now restocked with goods. Food distribution centers have emerged in major cities, providing provisions to those in need. Unemployment benefits and financial aid packages were quickly introduced to support those who lost their jobs. These measures provided a sense of security during uncertain times. However, the road ahead was not without challenges. The strain on government resources was undeniable. Subsidies and aid packages came at a significant cost, putting pressure on an already fragile economy. The issue of sustaining these relief efforts in the long term is now a significant concern for Shokay's administration."
turkestan.214.a: "The cost for immediate relief are high."

turkestan.215.t: "Divided Country - Divided Crises"
turkestan.215.d: "Madamin Bey sat in his makeshift office in Fergana's administrative center, contemplating the dire state of Turkestan's economy. As the ruler of a region blessed with fertile lands and agricultural wealth, he knew his choices could reshape the economic landscape. The crisis was reaching a tipping point, and he faced a critical decision. Madamin Bey considered reinforcing Fergana's self-sufficiency measures. The fertile fields of Fergana have always been a source of pride for its people. Embracing local autonomy would reinforce these values and further distance the region from Turkestan's troubles. Alternatively, Madamin Bey could choose to seek cooperation with Shokay's government."
turkestan.215.a: "Self-sufficient measures for Fergana."
turkestan.215.b: "Seek collaborative reforms with Shokay's government."

turkestan.217.t: "Threat of Divided Economies"
turkestan.217.d: "The leadership of Turkestan faced a dilemma that had been brewing for too long. Mustafa Shokay recognizes the undeniable truth: Fergana is an integral part of the republic's economy. Fertile fields, rich agricultural output, and bustling trade have long contributed to the nation's well-being. Despite political independence of the Madamin Bey's fiefdom, Fergana has been cooperating with the federal government in economic matters. However, Fergana's newfound self-sufficiency could possible threaten Turkestan's stability. For years Turkestan has benefited from the products, trade and resources of Fergana, but Madamin Bey's efforts to make Fergana self-sufficient are now undeniably affecting the republic's economic balance and directly challenges the Federal government.\n\nAs Fergana continues to assert its economic autonomy, Shokay's government faces a critical decision on how to respond to this growing challenge. Fergana's self-sufficiency posed a threat to the unity of Turkestan. To assert its influence, Shokay's government considered imposing an economic blockade on Fergana by controlling and blocking the critical railroads that connect the region to the rest of Turkestan. This would disrupt the flow of goods in and out of Fergana, putting pressure on its economy. While weakening Fergana's government economically, this choice could also lead to resentment and potentially radicalize the population. Shokay's determination to maintain control over the entire country is reflected in this decision, even at the cost of economic hardships. Alternatively, Shokay's government could invest heavily in the development of other regions within Turkestan to reduce dependence on Fergana's resources. To decrease Fergana's leverage over the republic, fostering economic growth and self-sufficiency elsewhere is a viable option. However, this approach requires substantial financial investments and time to yield results. This option demonstrates Shokay's commitment to preserving the unity of Turkestan by strengthening regions outside of Fergana."
turkestan.217.a: "Introduce economic blockade."
turkestan.217.b: "Focus on developing other regions."

turkestan.218.t: "Miner Strikes in Sülüktü"
turkestan.218.d: "The city of Sülüktü, rich in coal and located in the Kyrgyz region of Tian-Shan, has contributed significantly to the nation's energy needs and economic prosperity. However, in recent days, the coal miners of Sülüktü have risen in protest, probably provoked by the oppositional Kyrgyz Socialist Party \"Bukara\". Fueled by grievances regarding working conditions, wages, and safety concerns, the strike had paralyzed coal production, sending shockwaves through the region's power plants and industries.\n\nThe government has two choices on how to address the strikes. On one hand, we can negotiate with the miners. On the other hand, we can opt for a heavy-handed approach."
turkestan.218.a: "Negotiate with the miners."
turkestan.218.b: "Use force to quell the strike."

turkestan.219.t: "1st May Demonstrations in Tashkent"
turkestan.219.d: "On May 1st, Tashkent, the most industrially developed city of Turkestan, was filled with anticipation. The workers celebrated their labor, contributions to society, and unity. However, this year's celebrations had an undercurrent of tension that threatened to disrupt the harmony of the day. The streets of Tashkent were decorated with banners and flags, and the city's workers and residents turned out in large numbers. The opposition political party, ERK, organized a large May Day demonstration to demand workers' rights, improved living conditions, and an end to what they perceived as oppressive government policies. The government, led by Mustafa Shokay, faced a difficult decision. Although they recognized the people's right to peaceful assembly, the scale of the protest and the fiery rhetoric of the ERK leaders raised concerns. Shokay convened his advisors to discuss the situation.\n\nShokay can choose to honor the people's right to assemble and express their grievances. Allowing the peaceful demonstration to continue without interference may help voice the demonstrators' grievances and maintain democratic values. However, it could also enable ERK to mobilize and gain further support. Alternatively, Shokay can choose to disperse the protesters, fearing that the demonstration could escalate into violence or turn into a show of defiance against his government. Ordering the police to intervene, using tear gas and batons to break up the gathering, may disrupt the protest. However, it also risks increasing opposition to Shokay's government."
turkestan.219.a: "Allow peaceful protest."
turkestan.219.b: "Order to disperse the crowds."

turkestan.220.t: "Crisis on the Border"
turkestan.220.d: "The civil war in East Turkestan caused shockwaves throughout the region, and our Republic found itself at the center of a humanitarian crisis. In the border regions, particularly in East Pamir and Pishpek, the turmoil in Kashgar triggered a mass exodus of refugees, most of whom were of Kyrgyz origin. As news of this crisis reached the capital, a sense of urgency permeated the highest levels of government. Reports from the border towns indicate that families, whose lives have been upended by violence and uncertainty, are crossing into Turkestan seeking refuge. The dusty roads leading from Kashgar and Dihua to Turkestan's border regions are now crowded with people of all ages, clutching what little belongings they can carry. Turkestan's decision to open its borders and offer humanitarian aid is a compassionate choice that the country can be proud of. Despite the strain on our budget, refugees would find safety, shelter, and relief in Turkestan. Some ministers argued for caution, suggesting that Turkestan limit border access, subject refugees to stringent security checks, and direct them to established refugee camps. While this approach would reduce the strain on urban resources, it could risk overburdening the National Guard's resources to control the situation. Finally, some government officials advocated for a stricter response, proposing that Turkestan secure its borders to prevent refugees from entering. While this would prioritize national security and stability, it could also greatly damage the government's reputation in the eyes of our citizens. The cost of this decision may be too high."
turkestan.220.a: "Open the borders for the refugees!"
turkestan.220.b: "Limit the border access."
turkestan.220.c: "Secure the border, turn the refugees away!"

turkestan.221.t: "Shadows of the Silk Road"
turkestan.221.d: "As the conflict in East Turkestan intensified, the demand for illicit goods on the black market also increased. The black market, which had always been present in the region, experienced unprecedented growth during the East Turkestan crisis. During the chaos, smugglers, opportunists, and criminal networks took advantage of the situation and flooded the market with contraband, including weapons, drugs and stolen goods. The government could not ignore the surge in black market activity, and argued that cracking down on the black market is essential to curb criminal activity, preserve Turkestan's security, and protect the well-being of its citizens. Some voices in the government proposed a more pragmatic approach, suggesting that regulating and taxing the black market would be wise given our struggling economy. Another proposal emphasized the practical benefits of the black market, as the revenue generated from it could be used to fund the National Guard."
turkestan.221.a: "Crackdown on the black market!"
turkestan.221.b: "Tolerate it for the sake of economic growth."
turkestan.221.c: "Fund the National Guard by exploiting the black market."

turkestan.222.t: "The Turkestan Tenga"
turkestan.222.d: "During the Civil War, the State Bank of Tashkent issued the Turkestan Rouble, a vestige of Soviet Turkestan, which remained the primary currency in the aftermath of the conflict, supplemented by barter transactions. Foreign trade relied on Russian roubles, exposing Turkestan to the economic fluctuations of its neighbor. The crash of the Russian market led to inflation, which created an urgent need for Turkestan to establish its own national currency. In response to the economic crisis, establishing the Central Bank of Turkestan was a crucial step toward achieving economic autonomy and stability. The Turkestan Tenga was chosen as the cornerstone of this financial metamorphosis. The Tenga, with a rate of 1 Rouble to 10 Tenga, was set to reclaim Turkestan's economic destiny and banks soon became to exchange the old Roubles for the new Tenga. The Central Bank of Turkestan plays a crucial role in shaping the nation's monetary policy, it is responsible for regulating the money supply, interest rates, and currency issuance, as well as ensuring the stability of the financial sector. As the nation's financial custodian, the Central Bank will soon implement rigorous regulatory and supervisory frameworks to fortify banks and financial institutions against risks."
turkestan.222.a: "Hopefully, it will present some relief."

turkestan.223.t: "Offer From the Russo-Asiatic Bank"
turkestan.223.d: "During the economic crisis, the Russo-Asiatic Bank offered a loan to the government. Although the loan provided a chance for financial relief, it came with high interest rates and potential long-term bondage. Turkestan faced a critical decision with significant consequences. The country was at a crossroads, balancing the need to revive its economy with the risk of relying on an unstable neighbor. The Russo-Asiatic Bank, known for its questionable generosity, proposed an agreement that could either offer temporary relief or increase vulnerability. It is important to carefully consider the potential outcomes before accepting another offer from the Russians."
turkestan.223.a: "We should relieve the burden of our citizens."
turkestan.223.b: "But... we should not get into this bondage."

turkestan.224.t: "The Merchant, The Moon, The Settled Uzbek"
turkestan.224.d: "\"The Obscure Word 'Sart'\" is an article published by Mahmudkhodja Behbudiy in 1915. It could put an end to the issue of this term, which Imperial Russia used to call settled Uzbeks. The term has a complex history, having been both a symbol of occupational definition, a linguistic enigma, and even a pejorative marker. The term has a long history, originating from Sanskrit, where it meant 'merchant.'  Over time, the Turkic-speaking population in Fergana, Tashkent, and beyond was influenced by Mongolian and Arabic, and after that the language became a tool of Russian imperial policy. During the Imperial Russia era, the term 'Sart' was used to refer broadly to the settled population.\n\nHowever, under the new government, which sought pan-Turkism and social cohesion, the term came under scrutiny. Although it had previously been used as a tool of colonial policy, its origin and meaning were now a real mystery. The Shokay's government acknowledged the necessity of a new linguistic framework to attain social cohesion. Laws were enacted to relegate the term 'Sart' to the annals of history, as it had become a vestige of a past era and a representation of oppressive Russian colonialism. Jadidist intellectuals were elated when the word 'Sart' vanished from official discourse. Citizens also contributed to shaping this narrative. The saying, 'A bad Kyrgyz becomes a Sart and a bad Sart becomes a Kyrgyz,' has been around for many years, but it will finally fade into oblivion. People, in general, rejoiced at the disappearance of this pejorative term. Thus, Turkestan left behind the quirks and follies of imperial politics that once tried to define the indefinable."
turkestan.224.a: "The greatness of a nation is not determined by its name, but by the courage and enthusiasm of its representatives."

turkestan.225.t: "Rebirth of Tashkent Military School"
turkestan.225.d: "In 1914, on the eve of the Weltkrieg, the Tashkent Military School was established under the auspices of Imperial Russia. At the same time, a sister institution, the \"Tashkent School for the Training of Warrant Officers of Infantry\", was also founded in 1915, with the aim of training warrant officers to serve in the Turkestan Military District. With the rise of Soviet power in 1917, both institutions faced challenges. The Tashkent Military School became the site of conflict as junker cadets clashed with Bolshevik forces during the Bolshevik uprising in Tashkent, and it eventually closed its doors in the spring of 1918.\n\nDecades later, the institution remained silent, standing as a silent witness to the changing Turkestan. In the present day, the National Guard revived the school, breathing new life into its corridors and bringing back the spirit of military education. In the past, admission to the Tashkent Military School was restricted to a select few from specific social backgrounds. However, with the expansion of the curriculum and the introduction of advanced training programs, this institution has become a symbol of modernity and a place that aims to shape the next generation of officers. The opening ceremony was a significant event, attended by prominent dignitaries and military leaders. It marked a turning point in the history of Turkestan, as the national flag was raised over the newly expanded Tashkent Military School."
turkestan.225.a: "Glory to the National Guard!"

turkestan.226.t: "The Qyzylqum Race"
turkestan.226.d: "During the procurement discussions for equipping a unique troop of specialized camel divisions, a famous camel breeder from a distant Egyptian oasis proposed a rare breed of elite royal camels. These camels are known for their exceptional speed, endurance, and adaptability to harsh desert conditions. The breeder proposed a unique deal for acquiring equipment and transportation - a grand spectacle showcasing the prowess of hiselite camels in a race across the vast Qyzylqum desert.The military leadership, intrigued and amused by the proposal, accepted the challenge. The race occurred in the arid dunes of Qyzylqum, showcasing the harsh reality of potential warfare. Within half an hour, the winner was determined as the breeder's elite camels outpaced those of our military.  True to their commitment, the military acknowledged the superiority of these animals and struck a deal, making the elite camels valuable new members of the Turkestan Camel Corps."
turkestan.226.a: "A bit unusual way to sell."

turkestan.227.t: "The Night Guards"
turkestan.227.d: "Originating from a legacy dating back to the XVIII century, the Mirshabs were the nocturnal custodians of Turkestan. The term "Mirshab" itself refers to the head of the city's night guards. They patrolled the bustling streets and squares of its ancient cities, maintaining public order, resolving conflicts, and meticulously scrutinizing market scales. In Turkestan's past, they stood as the bastions of law and order, invoking both respect and apprehension.\n\nIn 1917, as Turkestan declared its first taste of independence, the Mirshabs became local militia units and the sole armed forces in the region, excluding illegal paramilitaries associated with radical movements and the Mujahideen. Led by Ergash Bey, these modern Mirshabs presented a challenge to the government's goal of maintaining stability.\n\nDiscussions unfolded within the government chambers regarding the integration of the Mirshabs into the official security apparatus. Another viewpoint suggested completely disbanding the Mirshabs, and establishing a new civilian police force that would be under government authority. This strategy aimed to eliminate any remaining connections to paramilitary groups and guarantee absolute loyalty to the government."
turkestan.227.a: "Disband the Mirshabs!"
turkestan.227.b: "Integrate the Mirshabs and oversight them."

turkestan.228.t: "Mirshab Insurgency"
turkestan.228.d: "As the government faced uncertainties regarding the loyalty of the Mirshabs, it made the pivotal decision to disband them, unleashing a tempest. Ergash Bey, the field commander of Turkestan Mirshabs, saw this not as a cessation but as a call to arms. The disbandment order, seen as a challenge to their existence and influence, fueled the flames of dissent. Under the command of Ergash Bey, the Mirshabs regrouped and declared an insurgency. Turkestan, which was already dealing with internal divisions, now faced a surge of unrest from a force that had controlled matters of law and order for decades."
turkestan.228.a: "We should suppress these traitors!"
turkestan.228.b: "We'll get them!"

turkestan.230.t: "Birth of the Academy of Sciences"
turkestan.230.d: "The dawn of the 20th century illuminated the growing need for higher education in Turkestan. As the region experienced rapid development, fueled by the increasing number of educated individuals emerging from institutions such as the Tashkent and Samarqand gymnasiums, Tashkent real school, and Teacher's Seminary, the aspiration for a university that met the highest standards of the era took root. The idea of creating such an institution had been in development since 1914, with careful preparations underway. However, the outbreak of the Weltkrieg disrupted these ambitious plans. Nevertheless, the demand for a higher education center persisted. As a result, the III Regional Congress of Soviets of Turkestan, which was held in November 1917, decided to establish a higher educational institution in Tashkent. On February 17, 1918, the constituent assembly of the Tashkent Society of Higher Education convened. Representatives from esteemed societies such as the Russian Geographical and Technical Societies, the Tashkent Society of Naturalists and Doctors, the Tashkent Pedagogical and Legal Societies, the Turkestan Agricultural Society, the Society of Muslim Teachers, Polytechnic Courses, and the Provincial Teachers' Union were present. On March 9, 1918, the Council of People's Commissars of Turkestan established a People's University under the Commissary of Education. The university was located in the premises of the military school and the palace of Grand Duke N. K. Romanov. On March 11, 1918, the university's council was formed, with A.V. Popov as director and esteemed agronomist Richard Schroeder as deputy director. The Muslim section of the People's University opened on May 12, 1918, in the Old Tashkent part of the city, attracting 945 students. This section aimed to promote women's education by establishing four schools for women and creating a nurturing environment for school and preschool-aged children.\n\nIn 1922, the Turkestan State University was established by the decree of the Khalq Majlisi, preserving the flame of knowledge from the People's University. With additional resources, the government aimed for a grander institution, the Academy of Sciences. Toshmuhammad Qari-Niyoziy led this new intellectual bastion. Starting in 1916 at the Russian-indigenous school in Fergana, he embarked on a journey that included teaching, founding the first elementary school in Turkestan, and playing a key role in establishing the inaugural Turkestan pedagogical technical school in Kokand. After graduating from the Physics and Mathematics Department at Turkestan State University in 1929, he became a professor and eventually served as the university's rector from 1931."
turkestan.230.a: "A great development!"

turkestan.231.t: "Richard Schroeder - A Pioneer of Agricultural Science in Turkestan"
turkestan.231.d: "Richard Schroeder was born on October 15, 1867, in Moscow, into an academic family. His father was a professor at the Petrovsky Academy of Agriculture and Forestry, and he instilled in Richard a love for knowledge. In 1887, Richard began to study natural sciences at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow University after completing his studies at the 4th gymnasium. Graduating with honors in 1891, Richard's academic excellence led him to the Petrov Agricultural Academy, where he further developed his expertise in agronomy. His curiosity and dedication to scientific inquiry were evident in works such as \"The Relation of Winter Breads to Phosphorus Fertilizers\" and \"To The Question of Protein Synthesis With Higher Plants.\" In 1900, armed with a master's degree from Moscow University, Richard embarked on a three-year scientific journey in Germany and Switzerland. There, under the guidance of esteemed professors, he studied the intricacies of plant physiology and the physiological chemistry of plants. A turning point in Richard's career occurred when he expressed a desire to apply his agricultural expertise where it was most needed.\n\nIn 1902, the Ministry of Agriculture sent Richard to lead the Turkestan Agricultural Experimental Station, where he provided agronomic assistance. Richard not only conducted scientific exploration but also immersed himself in the local culture, mastering the Uzbek language to understand age-old farming practices. Under Richard's guidance, the previously dormant experimental station became a hub of scientific activity. His attendance at the 1911 International Congress on Agriculture in the United States solidified his reputation on the global stage. In his report on \"California Fruit Growing\", Richard not only showcased his broad perspectives but also drew attention to the agricultural potential of Central Asia. Under Richard's leadership, the station conducted pioneering research in horticulture. They scrutinized over 200 varieties of fruits, including apples and pears, laying the foundation for acclimatization efforts in Central Asia. Richard's studies also encompassed viticulture, climatology, and the creation of the first-ever journal in Uzbek language, \"Dehkan\", to disseminate agricultural knowledge. His tireless efforts left an indelible mark on Turkestan's agricultural landscape. His legacy as a pioneering scientist, editor, and advocate for sustainable farming practices continues to inspire generations."
turkestan.231.a: "A great man!"

turkestan.232.t: "The Resurgence of Karkara Fair"
turkestan.232.d: "The Karkara Fair, which was once a bustling hub for commerce and cultural exchange in the late 19th to early 20th centuries, is set to reopen its gates. Located between Jarkent and Qaraqol counties, the fair attracted merchants from diverse backgrounds, including Chinese, Khivan, Bukharan, Tajik, Turkmen, Kyrgyz, and Russian. The fair's origin can be traced back to the nomadic area of Kazakhs from the Alban clan, known as Karkara. Russian merchants brought European goods to [589.GetName], while local Kazakh nomads engaged in a vibrant exchange of goods and resources with their livestock. However, the fair's vibrant history took a somber turn in 1916 when representatives of the Alban clan gathered on Mount Akbeit, refusing to comply with the Tsar's decree on conscription. Tensions escalated, resulting in arrests and armed struggles. The fair, once a symbol of trade and unity, fell silent as the region plunged into rebellion. Now, as the echoes of the past reverberate, the decision to reopen the Karkara Fair represents more than just an economic endeavor.  It is a testament to the resilience of communities and the restoration of historical connections.As merchants, nomads, and communities prepare to converge once again, the fair is a testament to the enduring spirit of connection and trade that defines Turkestan."

turkestan.233.t: "Paying the Debts"
turkestan.233.d: "As the deadline for the repayment of a loan from the Russo-Asiatic bank looms, our government finds itself under the weight of significant financial obligations. This loan, initially viewed as a lifeline during a period of economic crisis for the country, has now evolved into a time bomb ticking away.\n\nWith fewer options available and more dire consequences looming, the government finds itself at a critical crossroads. The decision to settle the debt may preserve our reputation as a dependable partner in the realm of international finance, but it would come at a high cost.\n\nFailure to meet the debt obligations would inflict a blow on Turkestan's economy. While it may provide short-term respite, the long-term repercussions could be catastrophic... International lenders are likely to perceive Turkestan as a high-risk borrower, potentially precluding future access to financial support."
turkestan.233.a: "We owe our victories to these loans."
turkestan.233.b: "Pay in gold, the rest in Russian rubles."
turkestan.233.c: "Who cares?"

turkestan.234.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Government In Debts"
turkestan.234.d: "In the early months of 1936, Turkestan's then-government heavily borrowed from the Russo-Asiatic Bank in order to address the economic crisis that was plaguing the region. These funds were deployed to bolster the ailing [FROM.GetAdjective] economy, enabling the government to swiftly resolve economic challenges. According to reports from Turkestan, these loans were granted on terms that were deemed unfair and unjust.Nonetheless, who compelled them to accept these terms?\n\nRegardless, the current [FROM.GetAdjective] government, which has aligned itself with our interests, has sought assistance and requested that the debt owed to the Russo-Asiatic Bank be written off. Undoubtedly, such a move will entail significant costs for the government, but in return, they have agreed to a series of substantial concessions. By agreeing to refinance their debt in this manner, we can significantly conserve our resources for the future integration of Turkestan into Russia."
turkestan.234.a: "We will make these concessions."

turkestan.235.t: "[FROM.GetName] Assists Us"
turkestan.235.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government nobly agreed to help us and repaid our loan to the Russo-Asiatic Bank. Unfortunately, this has only increased our debt to Russia, and their efforts to integrate us have only increased."

turkestan.236.t: "The Peril of Complete Financial Ruin"
turkestan.236.d: "In the aftermath of the government's contentious decision to settle a debt owed to the Russo-Asiatic Bank by drawing on its gold reserves, a catastrophic economic crisis ensued within a matter of weeks. With reserves nearly depleted and revenues unable to keep pace with escalating expenses, we found itself on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nThe economic collapse has had a particularly severe impact on ordinary people in Turkestan. The once bustling markets are now eerily quiet as traders struggle to restock their shelves. Inflation has soared, making essential goods such as bread and textiles unaffordable for most people. Urban workers are facing massive layoffs as industries shut down due to lack of investment and raw materials. Rural farmers, meanwhile, are seeing their income shrink due to a dramatic drop in crop prices. Protests and riots have erupted in major cities, with citizens demanding answers from a government they believe has squandered the nation's wealth. The attempts to stabilize the economic situation, such as implementing austerity measures and launching campaigns aimed at attracting foreign investment, have largely failed, further reinforcing the perception of ineffective governance."
turkestan.236.a: "Catastrophic!"

turkestan.237.t: "The Final Days of the Government"
turkestan.237.d: "The government of Turkestan has officially resigned, marking a dramatic culmination to weeks of economic upheaval and public unrest.

turkestan.250.d: "As Monstrov solidifies his grip on power in Turkestan, his attention turns towards the activities of the Turkestan Military Organization (TVO), a clandestine group seeking to promote Russian interests in the region. Concerned about potential challenges to his authority, Monstrov convenes a meeting of his closest advisors to discuss the situation. The discussion delves into the clandestine operations of the TVO, including their recruitment efforts, intelligence gathering, and potential collaboration with external forces.\n\nOn one hand, Monstrov can decide to take a hardline approach and order the immediate suppression of the TVO. Key members of the organization will be arrested, their networks dismantled and any assets or resources associated with their activities seized. Another approach is to avoid bloodshed and potential backlash, and initiate negotiations with the leadership of the TVO, offering concessions in exchange for their peaceful disbandment and integration into the Fergana Peasant Army."

turkestan.251.d: "Under Monstrov's decree, the Fergana Orthodox Church is officially recognized and sanctioned as an institution dedicated to the spiritual needs of the Russian-speaking population in Turkestan. Led by appointed clergy sympathetic to the government's agenda, the church aims to serve not only as a religious center but also as a unifying force for the Russian colonists.\n\nThe colonists, yearning for a connection to their cultural and religious roots, welcome the move as a positive step towards preserving their traditions. However, this decision raises concerns among other communities, particularly those who practice Islam. Konstantin Monstrov, in a public address, justifies the creation of the Fergana Orthodox Church as a means to ensure cultural preservation and religious freedom within Turkestan."
turkestan.251.a: "That should have been done long ago."

turkestan.252.t: "Stolypin's Legacy"
turkestan.252.d: "As Konstantin Monstrov undertakes the monumental task of transforming Turkestan's agrarian policies, he draws inspiration from the historical legacy of Pyotr Stolypin's reforms in Russia. First off, the 1921 Land and Water Nationalization Act was cancelled, and the notion of private land ownership for individual farmers was reinforced. Individual farmers are encouraged to merge smaller plots into more sizable estates, fostering efficiency and facilitating mechanization. Moreover, significant state resources were allocated to support the modernization of agricultural practices - adopting mechanized equipment and improved cultivation methods. Identifying vast stretches of unused or underutilized land, the government also initiated a redistribution process as colonists who actively cultivate the soil are granted ownership rights. The final act was the government provision of targeted support to smallholders."
turkestan.252.a: "Free real estate!"

turkestan.253.t: "Restoration of the General-Governorate"
turkestan.253.d: "In a bold and decisive move, Konstantin Monstrov unveils his vision for Turkestan by announcing the restoration of the General-Governorate, which ceased to exist decades ago. The new General-Governor has argued in a public speech that reinstating this structure, a central administrative authority, will provide a proven and effective model for governance in Turkestan. While the restoration of the Turkestan General-Governorate is presented as a measure to preserve stability and prevent potential fragmentation and Monstrov asserts that a strong and centralized leadership, a lot of critics of the regime publicly condemn this move, which they perceive as a regression towards imperial-era governance."
turkestan.253.a: "The dream of free Turkestan is finally dead."

turkestan.254.t: "Power Struggle"
turkestan.254.d: "After TVO successfully seized power, internal strife within the organization was expected due to Konstantin Osipov's actions.  On one side stands Ivan Zaitsev, the charismatic leader who led TVO to victory. Zaitsev advocates strong, centralized leadership under his command, emphasizing the restoration of Russian influence and control over Turkestan. On the other side stands Konstantin Osipov, a shrewd and calculating figure within the ranks of TVO, who is allegedly a left SR agent, though he denies it. Despite their differences, both leaders are committed to the success of TVO. In contrast to Zaytsev, Osipov is focused on consolidating his power by utilizing the Left Socialist Revolutionary platform and re-establishing Soviet authority in the region.\n\nThrough discreet meetings and negotiations, one of them is to gain authority over all of the TVO and become the new leader of the organisation, and his name is..."

They see Osipov's policies as a betrayal of the TVO's principles. In clandestine meetings and whispered conversations, Zaitsev gathers support from disgruntled officers and disillusioned members of the TVO. As tensions reach a boiling point, Zaitsev makes his move. With the backing of his supporters, he orchestrates a mutiny against Osipov's leadership, rallying dissident factions within the TVO to his cause. Under the cover of darkness, armed loyalists loyal to Zaitsev storm the organization's headquarters, seizing control and arresting key figures aligned with Osipov. If the mutiny is not quickly suppressed, we will face serious consequences!"

Armed with determination and a fierce sense of loyalty to their former leader, Zaitsev's forces swiftly gain control of key strategic positions within the organization's stronghold. Furthermore, they manage to seize power in Tashkent, Samarqand and Skobelev, ending the Osipov's weak power there. With each passing hour, the tide of the conflict decisively turns in favor of Zaitsev and his faction, as they consolidate their control over Turkestan and expel all remnants of Osipov's influence.\n\nIn the aftermath of the mutiny's success, Zaitsev emerges as the undisputed leader of the TVO, hailed by his followers as the savior of Turkestan.

Through careful coordination and decisive action, Osipov's defenders staunchly hold their ground, repelling wave after wave of attacks launched by Zaitsev's insurgents. Bolstered by reinforcements and bolstered by Osipov's unwavering leadership, the defenders of the Turkestan Soviet staunchly defend their positions, refusing to yield to Zaitsev's treachery. In a decisive turning point, Osipov's forces launch a daring counteroffensive, striking at the heart of Zaitsev's stronghold and shattering the insurgents' morale.

turkestan.261.t: "Socialization of Land"
turkestan.261.d: "The time has come to bring back land into the hands of the people. As Osipov unveils a sweeping land reform program under the guise of \"restructuring\" land ownership, in reality, his initiative entails the nationalization of land. As news of Osipov's land reform spreads throughout Turkestan, the reaction among the Russian colonist community is one of shock and dismay. The prospect of having their land forcibly seized and nationalized strikes fear and resentment among the colonists, who view Osipov's reforms as a direct threat to their way of life. In villages and settlements across Turkestan, the Fergana Peasant Army, led by Konstantin Monstrov, organizes protests and riots against Osipov."
turkestan.261.a: "Turkcheka will deal with it."

turkestan.262.t: "Appeal From Turkestan"
turkestan.262.d: "The recent news arrived from Turkestan, where the local 'Commissar', Konstantin Osipov, a Left SR member and our ally has sent us a formal address, where he hailed our common victory as a triumph for the principles of socialism and popular revolution. He extends an invitation for high-level representatives of the our government to visit Turkestan, where we can discuss mutual interests and explore avenues for collaboration. With Turkestan firmly under his control, Osipov presents himself as a reliable partner and staunch supporter of the Left SR cause."
turkestan.262.d2: "Konstantin Osipov, leader of the Turkestan Military Organization (TVO), has extended a heartfelt invitation to the exiled leaders of the Left Socialist Revolutionary Party. He clearly sees an opportunity to forge a powerful alliance aimed at liberating their homeland from the grips of counter-revolution and oppression. In a passionate appeal broadcasted across Turkestan, Osipov calls upon the exiled Left SR leaders to join him in establishing a united front against 'the forces of reaction'."
turkestan.262.a: "He's not representing the people of Turkestan!"

turkestan.264.t: "Left SRs Arrive to Turkestan"
turkestan.264.d: "The leaders of the Left SR party has recently arrived to Tashkent in order to join forces with us in our common struggle against counter-revolution in Russia. Their delegation, led by Vladimir Trutovsky and, surprisingly, Yakov Fishman, head of the Left SR terrorist group, have declared the legitimate Russian government to be currently located in exile in Turkestan and called for all enemies of the Revolution to get ready for the people's fist."
turkestan.264.a: "A new front opens!"

turkestan.270.t: "Fate of the Khivan Khan"
turkestan.270.d: "As we have integrated Khiva, which remained a constitutional monarchy under the rule of our Jadidist allies, an important question is what to do with the Khivan Khan. As we are essentially a republic, the existence of a monarchy inside our borders is at least strange. Furthermore, for a large amount of people monarchy remains a symbol of oppression, even if the Khivan Khan is merely a figurehead. We should dictate to our colleagues in Khiva to immediately abolish monarchy!"
turkestan.270.a: "The times of Khans and Emirs is truly over."


turkestan_jadidist.1.t: "The Executive Empowerment Act"
turkestan_jadidist.1.d: "The dust of the Civil War had barely settled, and the echoes of conflict still lingered in the air. With a vision to prevent the recurrence of civil strife, Shokay set his eyes on the executive office. His proposal was audacious, aiming to significantly expand the scope of his own authority. The decision, although deemed necessary by his loyal followers, caused concern among the people, raising doubts about the preservation of democratic principles in the new Turkestan.\n\nHowever, Shokay, being a democrat, presented the case for an empowered executive office and the stature of the Milliy Ittihod party to the Khalq Majlisi, the parliament of Turkestan. Supporters rallied behind Shokay's vision, highlighting the need for a strong hand to guide Turkestan towards stability. However, opposition voices labeled the move as a dangerous shift towards authoritarianism. Shokay was aware of the high stakes and knew that the success of his proposal could determine the future of Turkestan."
turkestan_jadidist.1.a: "The vote should pass, for the sake of stability!"

turkestan_jadidist.2.t: "Khalq Majlisi of Turkestan"
turkestan_jadidist.2.d: "The Khalq Majlisi consists of 54 members, divided into two curias that reflected the religious composition of the region. On one side, there were 36 representatives of the majority Muslim population, including Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Pamir peoples. On the other side, there were 18 members representing the Russian and Jewish communities. Milliy Ittihod holds a slight majority with 21 members. The Qadimist conservatives of Ittifoqi Muslimin, numbering 20, present a formidable opposition. The remaining members were scattered between ERK and non-partisans. Each vote became a potential turning point, and alliances within the Majlisi would play a crucial role in shaping the future trajectory of Turkestan."
turkestan_jadidist.2.a: "We should be careful."

turkestan_jadidist.3.t: "Ittifoqi Muslimin's Conditions"
turkestan_jadidist.3.d: "The negotiation room was filled with anticipation as representatives from Milliy Ittihod and Ittifoqi Muslimin gathered to discuss the fate of the Executive Empowerment Act. The coalition, though fragile, held the promise of unity in Turkestan. Ittifoqi Muslimin's main demand was to align governance and legislation with Sharia principles, including civil and criminal laws, by establishing the Mahqama-i-Shariya. They also aimed to influence the educational curriculum by emphasizing the teaching of Islamic values and history, while limiting the Jadidist influence of the new-Method schools. In addition, our coalition partners emphasized economic policies based on Islamic economic principles. These policies include reducing interest-based transactions, promoting equity, and supporting businesses aligned with conservative values."
turkestan_jadidist.3.d2: "The negotiating room was tense as representatives of Milliy Ittihod and Ittifoqi Muslimin grappled with the aftermath of their broken alliance. The scars of past betrayals were still fresh, and Ittifoqi Muslimin's demands reflected their ideological beliefs and history of shifting alliances. They insisted on directly supervising Islamic principles in governance by establishing Mahqama-i-Shariya. Additionally, our former coalition partners emphasized the importance of economic policies based on Islamic economic principles, such as reducing interest-based transactions, promoting equality, and supporting businesses consistent with conservative values."
turkestan_jadidist.3.a: "Accept the comprehensive set of demands."
turkestan_jadidist.3.b: "Negotiate on specific terms."
turkestan_jadidist.3.c: "Reject their demands."

turkestan_jadidist.5.t: "Influential Lobby of the Vadhyaev Brothers"
turkestan_jadidist.5.d: "The origins of the Vadhyaev family can be traced back to Bukhara, where the Jewish community faced discrimination from the Muslim majority. Despite these challenges, the Vadhyaevs thrived in trade, especially in the realm of dyes. Legend has it that a fortuitous shipment from Russia brought them unexpected wealth, propelling them into positions of influence. Haim Vadhyaev, the patriarch, established a successful family business in the dye trade. His sons, including Isaac-Borukh, Neryo, Zion, and Yakub, inherited and expanded the business. Yakub and Sion achieved great success, transforming their family firm into the formidable \"Vadhyaev Brothers\" trading house. The brothers showed exceptional acumen, expanding into textiles by acquiring the Ivanovo-Voznesenskaya manufactory. During the early days of Turkestan autonomy in 1917 under Mustafa Shokay, Yakub Vadhyaev held a ministerial role, demonstrating the close relationship between economic influence and political collaboration. As Turkestan emerged from the civil war, the Vadhyaev brothers used their economic power to seek assurances and subsidies for their company. They requested significant financial subsidies to strengthen their textile combine, highlighting their crucial support for Turkestan's cause during the civil war. Acknowledging their economic importance, the brothers sought guarantees of stability in trade policies and economic conditions, including protection from arbitrary regulations and a favorable environment for their businesses to prosper. To protect their interests, the Vadhyaevs asked for representation in important economic committees. This was done to ensure their influence in decision-making processes that could affect their economic ventures. As supporters of charitable causes, the Vadhyaevs called for government assistance in developing infrastructure, particularly in areas where their businesses were prominent. This involved asking for better transportation networks and utilities."

turkestan_jadidist.6.t: "Faith in the Balance"
turkestan_jadidist.6.d: "The decision to seek the backing of the influential Vadhyaev brothers resonates through the streets, stirring a fervor among the Muslim population. Voices of dissent rise, as faithful believers gather to express their concerns. The decision to align with the wealthy Jewish community has ignited a spark of discontent among the Muslim factions within Ittifoqi Muslimin and Milliy Ittihod. Protesters, driven by religious fervor, demand an explanation from their leaders. The air is charged with tension as the delicate balance between religious principles and political alliances hangs in the balance. The faithful question whether this move compromises the integrity of their cause, and the leaders find themselves navigating the complex terrain of faith and pragmatism.\n\nWith the government in stress, Shokay is presented with a possibility to address the faithful directly, acknowledging their fears and emphasizing the pragmatic necessity of seeking support from the Vadhyaev brothers. Shokay should also publicly state that this alliance is a means to strengthen the country economically and that religious values will not be compromised. Moreover, respected religious leaders should be invited to endorse the decision, hoping to sway public opinion in favor of the practical benefits. On the other hand, a discreet  approach can be chosen. By engaging influential religious leaders in private discussions, we can seek their support and understanding. Shokay aims to convince them that the alliance with the Vadhyaev brothers is a temporary necessity for the greater good. By gaining the support of key religious figures, he hopes to quell the unrest among the Muslim population without openly challenging the decision in the public domain."
turkestan_jadidist.6.a: "A public platform is preferable."
turkestan_jadidist.6.b: "No need in public attention, decide everything behind-the-scenes."

turkestan_jadidist.7.t: "The Union Not Only In Name"
turkestan_jadidist.7.d: "When Shokay proposed the law to strengthen executive powers, a deep ideological split emerged within the Milliy Ittihod. The party, established on Jadidist principles, is split between the vision of its founder, Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, and Shokay's 'Kerenskyist' approach. Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, the respected founder and current foreign minister, leads the opposing faction. He, along with the more liberal members of the party, sees Shokay's initiatives as a deviation from the democratic ideals that originally motivated the party's formation. The group stresses the importance of reclaiming these principles and advocates for a more decentralized, participatory governance structure. Shokay is directly challenged by the leftist faction, who demand the reinstatement of Jadidist principles in the party's manifesto and criticize what they perceive as a shift towards a pro-Russian position. Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan advocates for the appointment of Shoh-Islom Shagiahmetov, a respected Jadidist educator, as the new minister of education. Meanwhile, Shokay could adopt a more populist and pragmatic approach by appealing directly to the party's grassroots members. He could organize town hall meetings and rallies to gather support for the Act, emphasizing the urgency of a strong government to lead Turkestan through post-war reconstruction and economic recovery."
turkestan_jadidist.7.a: "Accept the demands."
turkestan_jadidist.7.b: "Grassroots mobilization."

turkestan_jadidist.8.t: "The Perilous Act"
turkestan_jadidist.8.d: "Mustafa Shokay, accompanied by his supporters, entered the podium of the Khalq Majlisi. The Minister-President of Turkestan presented the Executive Empowerment Act. This proposal caused unease among the assembly members due to its authoritarian overtones, even though the law did make some concessions to the parliament. Nevertheless, the law included clauses that gave the president the power to unilaterally pass laws and dissolve parliament at will - and all these just before the elections. Shokay argued that taking such measures was necessary for rapid reconstruction, stability, and the prevention of future civil conflicts.\n\nReactions in parliament varied. Members of Milliy Ittihod, some of whom were loyal to Shokay and some who were not, appeared to disagree with the departure from democratic principles. Members of ERK and Kadimists were strictly opposed. Realizing the concerns of the parliamentarians, Shokay opened the floor for discussion. The Kadimist conservatives proposed a more balanced approach. This proposal aimed to reduce the power of authoritarian amendments by introducing checks and balances. It suggested that significant decisions should require parliamentary approval, limiting the president's ability to wield power alone. It also prohibited the unilateral dissolution of parliament. "
turkestan_jadidist.8.a: "A balanced approach is accepted."
turkestan_jadidist.8.b: "If Majlisi cannot voice their opinion, the President will."

turkestan_jadidist.9.t: "Vote On The Executive Empowerment Act"
turkestan_jadidist.9.d: "The time has come! After months of pleas, threats and compromises we are finally here. The Majlisi constitutional committee has approved the Act, and it is ready to be presented for voting. It is entirely possible that this day may decide the course of the entire strife plaguing our nation. Now we can only wait for the results of the vote. And the Act is..."
turkestan_jadidist.9.a: "Passed!"
turkestan_jadidist.9.b: "Voted down!"

turkestan_jadidist.10.t: "The Era of Authority"
turkestan_jadidist.10.d: "So, the Khalq Majlisi passed the Emergency Empowerment Act, marking the beginning of a truly new era. Mustafa Shokay wasted no time in exercising his newfound authority, having secured the legal arsenal to consolidate his power. The first stroke of his executive pen was the temporary abolition of elections until the government deemed the situation stable enough. This move sparked a storm of dissent in the Milliy Ittihod party. The faction, led by the charismatic Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, strongly opposed Shokay's decision. The dissent went beyond the party line. Ittifoqi Muslimin, once a supporter of Shokay's government, announced a complete break-up. Discontent was palpable, but even if they had united in opposition, the number of votes was not in their favor to pass a vote of no confidence. The Emergency Powers Law ushered in a period of authority, but the tumultuous atmosphere in parliament foreshadowed future challenges. "
turkestan_jadidist.10.a: "It seems Turkestan just cannot be stable."

turkestan_jadidist.11.t: "The Fall of Authority"
turkestan_jadidist.11.d: "So, in the Khalq Majlisi, the fate of the Emergency Powers Law was uncertain. Lawmakers were tense as they considered the consequences of granting Mustafa Shokay unprecedented powers. Turkestan's democratic principles were at stake. During the parliamentary debate, a coalition of dissenters emerged. In response to perceived abuse of power, the Qadimists and Milliy Ittihod factions joined forces to oppose Shokay's authoritarian tendencies. Together, they held a majority and the law was met with universal condemnation. Parliament passed a vote of no confidence in the Shokay's government. The Qadimists, in alliance with the opposition faction, declared their intention to seek justice through available legal means. Allegations of power abuse were made against Shokay and his closest aides.\n\nAfter the vote of no confidence, Shokay's resignation became inevitable. Following the constitutional order, acting President Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan was given the responsibility of governing Turkestan in difficult times. In his statement, Abdurrashidkhan not only announced a snap election but also emphasized the commitment to restoring Turkestan's cherished democratic ethos."

turkestan_jadidist.12.t: "Yosh Turkiston"
turkestan_jadidist.12.d: "The Milliy Ittihod party experienced a growing discontent. The majority, led by the more liberal faction, decided that Mustafa Shokay's vision for Turkestan no longer aligned with the party's foundational principles. As a result, Shokay and his loyalists were formally removed from the party. As the party carried out this internal cleansing, Shokay was ousted from the political stronghold he once commanded.\n\nHowever, Shokay, resilient and determined, did not retreat into political oblivion. Instead, he took the opportunity to introduce a new movement called 'Yosh Turkiston' or 'Young Turkestan'. Shokay embraced Pan-Turkism and emphasized social unity and stability, aiming to create a unique ideological space for his supporters. This set the stage for a political showdown, with former allies now competing as rivals. The split in the ranks of Milliy Ittihod not only reshaped the party but also gave rise to a new force in Turkestan's politics."
turkestan_jadidist.12.a: "A rift in the ranks."

turkestan_jadidist.13.t: "Case of Mustafa Shokay"
turkestan_jadidist.13.d: "The Qadimists advocated for legal action against Mustafa Shokay, claiming that his time in office was tainted by abuses of power. The government, now led by Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, formed a special committee to discuss the important question: whether or not to pursue legal action. The atmosphere was tense as committee members presented their arguments, aware of the gravity of the situation. Those in favor of legal action emphasized the need for accountability, arguing that a failure to act might set a precedent for unchecked power. The Qadimists believed that the law must be upheld, irrespective of the political ramifications. Opposing voices raised concerns about the potential backlash. They cautioned that a legal dispute could worsen the current political divisions, increasing tensions in an already unstable Turkestan. The prospect of unrest and the potential for Shokay's supporters to rally against the government loomed over the decision. The committee wrestled with the dilemma, balancing the scales of justice with the fragile stability of the nation. As they navigated the complex legal and political landscape, each member faced the difficult decision of choosing between pursuing justice and maintaining a fragile peace."
turkestan_jadidist.13.a: "Sue him for the tyranny."
turkestan_jadidist.13.b: "Leave the man alone, he already lost."

turkestan_jadidist.14.t: "Flight of the Fallen"
turkestan_jadidist.14.d: "Following the decision to pursue legal action against Mustafa Shokay, the grip of justice tightened around the once-powerful leader. Shokay, unwilling to face the consequences of his actions, orchestrated a daring escape from Turkestan. Details emerged of a covert operation that involved trusted confidantes and secret routes.\n\nDespite Shokay's escape, the court proceedings continued. Mustafa Shokay was tried in absentia, symbolically held accountable for the alleged abuses of power during his rule. In the courtroom, Shokay's defense team presented a vigorous case on his behalf, arguing that the charges were politically motivated and a desperate attempt by rivals to tarnish his legacy. They claimed that the former leader had acted within the bounds of executive authority, framing his decisions as necessary measures to maintain stability in a tumultuous time."
turkestan_jadidist.14.a: "Only cowards run from truth."

turkestan_jadidist.15.t: "A Group of Turkestan 'Refugees'"
turkestan_jadidist.15.d: "This night the soldiers that were closely watching the border with [FROM.GetAdjective] suspected a group of people to be not true 'refugees' from Turkestan, as they had introduced themselves to the Border Guard. Apparently, it happened to be that one of the refugees was closely resembling the ex-president of [FROM.GetName], Mustafa Shokay, who was in hiding due to the criminal procedure against him. After several hours of interrogation, this person made full admission that he really is Mustafa Shokay and he asked for asylum within our country. This case was immediately brought to [ROOT.GetLeader] and the discussion began. Some have suggested that due to our relations with Turkestan we should definetely deliver him to Turkestan authorities. The others, however, suggested that perhaps keeping him in our country means we can later establish a collaboration movement in [FROM.GetName], friendly towards us, as Shokay would likely create an exile movement of his own, considering his great political ambitions."
turkestan_jadidist.15.a: "Deliver this criminal to the Supreme Court of Turkestan."
turkestan_jadidist.15.b: "We should not underestimate his usefulness."

turkestan_jadidist.16.t: "The Prodigal Son"
turkestan_jadidist.16.d: "Mustafa Shokay's escape was short-lived as the [FROM.GetAdjective] border security and government, bound by legal obligations and diplomatic pressure, extradited the fallen leader back to Turkestan. The former powerful ruler found himself in the hands of the very justice system he had tried to evade. Upon his arrival, Shokay was promptly arrested and taken to a courtroom to face the consequences of his actions. With Shokay now present in court, the final phase of a long legal battle began. The charges of power abuse, corruption, and violations of democratic principles were meticulously presented to the judges. As the prosecution and defense made their cases, the nation anxiously awaited the court's decision. The judges deliberated under the weight of public expectations. Their verdict would have a significant impact on Turkestan's future."
turkestan_jadidist.16.a: "Suspence is overwhelming."

turkestan_jadidist.17.t: "Rise of the Exile"
turkestan_jadidist.17.d: "In a dramatic turn of events, Mustafa Shokay emerged from the shadows, boldly stepping into the public eye in the [FROM.GetAdjective] city of [FROM.Capital.GetName]. He declared the creation of the 'Turkestan Democratic Front,' a movement he asserted to be the legitimate voice of exiles committed to restoring stability and order in Turkestan. Shokay's appearance sent shockwaves through the Turkestani government, prompting swift condemnation of the country that had hosted him. The official statement labeled Shokay's actions as an affront to Turkestan's sovereignty and a blatant disregard for the legal processes that had played out in the homeland. The Turkestan government, in a unified response, underscored its commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice prevailed. Shokay's attempt to rally support from abroad was met with skepticism domestically, as many questioned the legitimacy of an exiled movement seeking to influence the affairs of a sovereign nation."
turkestan_jadidist.17.a: "This can lead to diplomatic crisis."

turkestan_jadidist.18.t: "The Conviction"
turkestan_jadidist.18.d: "In a surprising turn of events, the Supreme Court has found Mustafa Shokay guilty of the charges against him. The judges carefully presented the evidence from the trial, highlighting instances where Shokay's actions were deemed to have violated constitutional boundaries. The courtroom fell silent as the verdict was announced. Shokay, who was once a powerful political figure, now faces legal consequences. The judges sentenced him to a significant term of imprisonment, considering the severity of the offenses.\n\nMilliy Ittihod, the party that had once supported Shokay, viewed it as a validation of their concerns. Ittifoqi Muslimin, on the opposing side, welcomed the verdict as a triumph of justice. However, Shokay's newly formed movement, Yosh Turkiston, faced an uphill battle. With its leader now convicted, the movement struggled to maintain its momentum. The charismatic figurehead's fall from grace cast a shadow over the viability of Yosh Turkiston as a political force."
turkestan_jadidist.18.a: "Justice."

turkestan_jadidist.19.t: "The Acquittal"
turkestan_jadidist.19.d: "In a surprising turn of events, the Supreme Court has declared Mustafa Shokay innocent of the charges against him. The judges concluded that Shokay operated within the legal boundaries of the constitution during his presidency. The controversial Executive Empowerment Act, which sparked heated debates, was found to be in alignment with the recommendations of the constitutional committee. The courtroom was filled with a mix of astonishment and disbelief as the decision reverberated throughout the nation. Shokay, who was once facing severe consequences, emerged from the legal ordeal unscathed.\n\nMilliy Ittihod, the party that had once supported Shokay, was now deeply dissatisfied with the verdict and was contemplating its next move. Ittifoqi Muslimin, standing on the opposite side, expressed their discontent with the outcome and questioned the integrity of the legal system. The political landscape was turbulent after the trial, and its aftermath cast a long shadow over the nation. Shokay's acquittal not only solidified their position but also intensified political polarization in Turkestan. As the nation grappled with the implications of the court's decision, the echoes of the trial continued to shape its future political landscape."
turkestan_jadidist.19.a: "We should respect the law."

turkestan_jadidist.20.t: "Judgment"
turkestan_jadidist.20.d: "In the heart of [Capital.GetName]'s Presidential Palace, Mustafa Shokay presided over a gathering that would determine the fate of a man who had dared to challenge the essence of the Turkestan Republic. A prosecutor, armed with legal doctrines, presented the charges against Madamin Bey. His attempt to establish a parallel government, armed resistance, and refusal to acknowledge the Turkestan Republic's authority were exposed. Shokay's advisors debated the legal and political implications of the decision. Both options had their merits and drawbacks. The President faced a difficult choice: prosecute Madamin Bey to assert the rule of law or show leniency as a gesture of reconciliation.  The decision was based on the legal argument that the Provisional Fergana Government, which had existed for two decades, had violated established laws, particularly in areas beyond the jurisdiction of the Turkestan Republic."
turkestan_jadidist.20.a: "He should be tried for treason."

turkestan_jadidist.21.t: "Trial of Madamin Bey"
turkestan_jadidist.21.d: "The trial of Madamin Bey took place in [Capital.GetName]. During the opening arguments, the establishment of the rival government was analyzed, along with its defiance of Turkestan's legal authority, and the subsequent unrest that had plagued the region. The courtroom was silent as witnesses took the stand and recounted tales of armed resistance, acts of insubordination, and territories where the laws of the Turkestan Republic held no sway. As the trial approached its ending, the verdict was clear - Madamin Bey was found guilty of crimes against the Turkestan Republic."
turkestan_jadidist.21.a: "Finally, this bandit was conviced for his crimes."

turkestan_jadidist.22.t: "Trial of Konstantin Monstrov"
turkestan_jadidist.22.d: "The trial of Konstantin Monstrov took place at the courthouse in [Capital.GetName] to expose his involvement in the Fergana Provisional Government and leadership of the 'Fergana Peasant Army.'\n\nMonstrov is a charismatic and passionate leader, well-known in Turkestan as a prominent figure during civil war. The prosecution began by describing him as an ethnic Russian man who held authority among the Russian peasant settlers. A charismatic man with a long mustache played a key role in the formation of the Provisional Fergana government two decades ago. The court examined Monstrov's political ambitions, his ties to the Turkestan military organization and the Russian government, his association with Madamin Bey, and his motives for establishing a rival government in the Fergana Valley. During the trial, the prosecution focused on Monstrov's leadership of the 'Fergana Peasant Army,' an armed group of Russian settlers. The group was accused of various crimes, including sowing dissent, tax evasion, illegal black market trading, and arms smuggling. Several witnesses, mostly Muslims, testified. The prosecution spoke of Monstrov's influence over the disillusioned masses of Russian 'colonizers' and the military might he allegedly commanded. In response, the defense presented Monstrove as a defender of the people, speaking out against the injustices and grievances of not only the Bolsheviks but also the mujahideen. Finally, the verdict was announced, declaring Konstantin Monstrov..."
turkestan_jadidist.22.a: "...guilty of offenses against the Turkestan Republic."
turkestan_jadidist.22.b: "...innocent!"

turkestan_jadidist.23.t: "Echoes of Treacherous Escape"
turkestan_jadidist.23.d: "Following the collapse of the Provisional Fergana Government, Madamin Bey's escape has plunged the anticipated trial for his crimes into uncertainty. The courtroom became a trial by proxy for a figure who had vanished beyond the borders. The charges against Madamin Bey, which included sedition and rebellion, were presented in detail. The legal proceedings examined the actions and aspirations of the Provisional Fergana Government in the context of legal scrutiny. The organization, which no longer held any authority, was condemned by the court for challenging the sovereignty of the Turkestan Republic and Madamin Bey was pronounced guilty in absentia."
turkestan_jadidist.23.a: "Absent or not, criminal he is."

turkestan_jadidist.24.t: "The White Guard of Turkestan"
turkestan_jadidist.24.d.intro: "To limit the Turkestan Military Organization's influence, the government took a multilateral approach. Direct confrontation was avoided to prevent unrest, and a subtle strategic play was chosen to weaken the TVO's influence on ethnic Russian communities. The government has enacted laws to regulate paramilitary groups. Additionally, Shokay made efforts to connect with ethnic Russian leaders, promising them increased representation and cultural preservation. Furthermore, state-controlled media and Russian-language newspapers were used to cover cases of TVO excesses, subtly framing them as a threat to the entire population."
turkestan_jadidist.24.d.monstrov_arrested: "$turkestan_jadidist.24.d.intro$\n\nHowever, the community was dissatisfied with the arrest and conviction of their recognized leader, Konstantin Monstrov. Such actions are not easily forgotten, and despite the government's attempts to win over the Russian-speaking population, it appears to be a difficult task. Laws and increased security measures reduced the influence of TVOs, but they still conspired strongly, preventing a peaceful resolution of the issue."
turkestan_jadidist.24.d: "$turkestan_jadidist.24.d.intro$\n\nHowever, the Russian-speaking settlers were not willing to be deceived. They demanded more than just representation in parliament; they wanted national-cultural autonomy, recognition of the Russian language as the state language of Turkestan, and amnesty for their representative, Konstantin Monstrov. Monstrov himself claimed to be ready to disband his armed group and swear allegiance to Turkestan."

turkestan_jadidist.24.c: "We cannot trust a man who fought against us."

turkestan_jadidist.25.t: "The Russian Settlers"
turkestan_jadidist.25.d: "Today, the government had a heated discussion about the future of Turkestan's relations with Russian settlers. The recent defeat of the Provisional Fergana Government has brought the 'problem of Russian settlers' to the forefront. The legacy of the Stolypin reform has led to the rise of the Russian question, as Russian settlements appeared in the Fergana Valley, creating a complex problem for sovereign Turkestan. The discussion centered around the options of assimilation and repatriation. The president stressed the significance of unity in Turkestan, where Russian settlers and local Muslims coexist and contribute to the republic's overall prosperity. 'Our republic is not monocultural; assimilation is not a compromise, but a recognition of our common destiny,' the president stated. However, some opposition voices in the government favored repatriation. The concern was about the long-term impact of Russian settlers, viewed as remnants of colonialism that could hinder Turkestan's goals. The opposing side argued that the struggle for independence should not be jeopardized by colonial remnants. They proposed repatriating the settlers to shape the republic's future under the influence of the local population, not immigrants."

turkestan_jadidist.25.b: "Repatriation and resettlement."

turkestan_jadidist.26.t: "Seeds of Dissent"
turkestan_jadidist.26.d: "Unrest was brewing in the fields of the Fergana Valley. The government's decision to relocate Russian peasants from Turkestan to solve the delicate "Russian settlers issue" set off a chain reaction. Konstantin Monstrov, the charismatic leader of the Fergana Peasant Army, took it as a personal insult and an affront to the principles they had fought for during the turbulent days of the civil war in Turkestan. The peasants' discontent quickly spread, and Monstrov took advantage of the situation. He rallied the disillusioned masses to revolt against the government by appealing to their fervor to oppose the 'Muslim cabal'. Upon learning of the impending rebellion, [GetLeader] called an emergency meeting with key advisors and military commanders to address the unrest. The advisors recommended striking the first blow to quell the rebellion."
turkestan_jadidist.26.a: "We always knew we should not trust the Russians."

turkestan_jadidist.27.t: "Russian Settlers of Fergana Valley"
turkestan_jadidist.27.d: "The decision of Turkestan to repatriate and resettle Russian peasants became widely known beyond the Ferghana Valley and reached our Foreign Minister. The government, always vigilant about the interests of its citizens abroad, now faced a delicate situation that could worsen already complicated relations with the Turkestan Republic. Public sentiment in Russia, fueled by the plight of compatriots to be resettled, increased pressure on the government to act decisively.\n\nAs the discussion progressed, several possible courses of action were considered. One option was for the Russian government to express its discontent through diplomatic channels by sending a formal protest against Turkestan's policies. This approach would allow for the expression of discontent without escalating tensions. Another option was to use economic measures to express discontent."
turkestan_jadidist.27.a: "A formal protest!"

turkestan_jadidist.28.t: "Formal Protest From Russia"
turkestan_jadidist.28.d: "[ROOT.GetLeader], surrounded by advisers and diplomats, was carefully considering the implications of the diplomatic protest filed by the Russian authorities. A meeting was called at [Capital.GetName], at which the Russian ambassador, with a stern face, presented a formal diplomatic protest expressing the Russian government's displeasure at the treatment of Russophone population in Turkestan."
turkestan_jadidist.28.a: "They are responsible for creating this situation!"

turkestan_jadidist.29.t: "The Weight of Economic Sanctions"
turkestan_jadidist.29.d: "In response to our decision to repatriate Russian settlers, the Russian government declared an economic embargo. To counter the effects of the impending sanctions, they proposed emergency economic measures such as diversifying trading partners, stimulating domestic industry, and implementing policies to mitigate the expected economic downturn."

turkestan_qadimist.1.d: "Ergash Bey, the leader of Ittifoqi Muslimin, has given way to a potential monarchy, and there are serious chances that he may choose to proclaim himself as the Emir of Turkestan. Supporters argue that solidifying his rule as a singular authority, combining political and religious leadership, ensures a strong and centralized governance structure guided by Islamic principles.

turkestan_qadimist.1.ott: "On the other hand, as suggested by Sherali Lapin himself, one of the Ottoman princes could become the Sultan of Turkestan: Mehmed Abdülkerim, grandson of the esteemed Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II; Mehmed Orhan, or Mahmud Namik, the grandson of Sultan Mehmed V."
turkestan_qadimist.1.d2: "The Ittifoqi Muslimin has decided to restore a monarchist regime in Turkestan, and the decision of who will ascend the throne is now at the forefront of political discussions. Several prominent candidates have emerged as potential heirs to the Turkestani throne.\n\nAzamat-Bey Khudoyar-Khan is one of them, and he brings with him a legacy of regional governance.

As part of these changes, the creation of Turkestan's own Senate, the Mahqama-i-Shariya, was announced. The Senate would have a dual role: publishing and explaining the requirements of Shariah to the population, while also serving as the supreme judicial institution of the Turkestan Republic.\n\nThe Khalq Majlisi, which represents the legislative will of the people, would now be closely linked to the Mahqama-i-Shariya, ensuring that the legal system of Turkestan is harmonized with both the aspirations of the population and the principles of Sharia.\n\nWhile this was a compromise between the government and the Qadimists, Milliy Ittihod expressed caution, emphasizing the importance of preserving the secular character of the state."

This has raised concerns about their potential influence on the nation's future. To address this issue, [ROOT.GetLeader] has initiated a strategy to eliminate the TVO's influence from Turkestan. To promote internal stability, our leader has taken measures to increase counterintelligence operations aimed at dismantling the TVO's network in Turkestan. Loyal Mirshabs have been deployed to infiltrate suspected TVO cells under the cover of darkness, gathering valuable information on the organization's structure, leadership, and plans. Additionally, disinformation campaigns have been launched to sow discord among the TVO ranks and create confusion about their true objectives. The location of the organization's headquarters in Tashkent was eventually identified, and the individuals responsible for leading the group were apprehended, but not all of them. Furthermore, there was a crackdown on the Ferghana Peasant Army, which was disarmed and its charismatic leader, Konstantin Monstrov, also detained."

turkestan_qadimist.4.d: "After the Turkestan Military Organization's defeat and the stabilization of the region, attention has turned to the Russian colonists who have not yet fully integrated into Turkestani society. The land of Turkestan, which has been entrusted to the guardianship of local communities by Allah, must be reclaimed from the secular shackles imposed by the Land Nationalization Act of 1921. While we recognize the right of the native people of Turkestan to their land, there are Russophone communities within the area controlled by the Ferghana Peasant Army that currently occupy it.\n\nA proposal has been suggested to repatriate these colonists back to Russia, which would allow them to seek prosperity within their homeland while also ensuring that the land of Turkestan is returned to its rightful custodians. This repatriation is in line with principles of mercy and justice, ensuring that each individual finds solace in their rightful place.\n\nAdditionally, the government is exploring the possibility of establishing customary land agreements in accordance with the principles of Sharia. These agreements would recognize the historical ties of both locals and colonists to the land. The objective is to foster a harmonious coexistence that recognizes the rights and aspirations of all parties concerned."

turkestan_qadimist.5.d: "In the heart of the Fergana Valley, Madamin Bey announces the victory of the Ferghana Provisional Government to a jubilant crowd. The coalition of the Mujahideen and the Fergana Provisional Government has achieved what seemed unattainable for decades. Madamin Bey expresses his commitment to unity and a vision of a new, strong Turkestan. In an effort to establish stability and formal governance, Madamin Bey has declared himself the new President of Turkestan and has created a structured administration, incorporating key figures from both the Mujahideen and the Fergana Peasant Army. Madamin Bey has stated that this leadership is interim and merely a stepping stone to the envisioned just elections that will empower the people. Despite the apparent unity presented to the public, there are some internal tensions that need to be addressed. The recent alliance with the Mujahideen has led to some dissatisfaction among the Fergana Peasant Army and Konstantin Monstrov, who serves as Madamin Bey's deputy. This has made the already fragile peace even more precarious, and Madamin Bey is now faced with the challenge of keeping all factions united. Additionally, a presidential decree has been quietly issued, temporarily suspending elections until the situation stabilizes. Madamin Bey has cited the need for a secure environment for fair elections as the reason for this decision. However, some officials and opposition leaders view this move with skepticism, as they suspect that he may not relinquish the power he has long sought."
turkestan_qadimist.5.a: "The decades-long rivalry is finally over?"

turkestan_qadimist.6.t: "Opposition Consolidates"
turkestan_qadimist.6.d: "Madamin Bey's presidential decree dissolved [TRK_get_majlis_name], which marked the end of the formal parliamentary structure in Turkestan. While this move solidified his control, it also caused discontent among those who had previously championed democratic governance. In a surprising turn of events, the Jadidist opposition formed a coalition with the socialist ERK party, which had previously excluded Mustafa Shokay and his loyalists from the government. Together, they declare themselves as the official government, which challenges the legitimacy of Madamin Bey's rule. The Qadimist party, Ittifoqi Muslimin, has refrained from joining the opposition coalition. Their leadership sees an opportunity to influence the direction of the nation from within, leveraging their ideological closeness with the Provisional Fergana Government."

turkestan_qadimist.7.d: "Mustafa Shokay, who was removed from the Milliy Ittihod party and excluded from the newly formed opposition coalition, has taken the opportunity to establish his own path. He has announced the creation of a new movement called 'Yosh Turkiston' or 'Young Turkestan', which promotes Pan-Turkism and emphasizes social unity and stability as the foundations of his movement. The party aims to expand beyond the ideological boundaries of the socialist ERK coalition and the Provisional Fergana Government led by Madamin Bey. While presenting itself as a genuine oppositional force, 'Yosh Turkiston' has chosen not to collaborate with either the socialist or Madamin Bey's frameworks. Shokay envisions a Turkestan that follows a unique path aligned with the principles of Pan-Turkism and social harmony. In response to the rise of 'Yosh Turkiston', Madamin Bey issued a decree accusing Mustafa Shokay of treason and alleged corruption during his earlier presidency. This move has escalated the power struggle and added fuel to the already volatile political situation."

turkestan_qadimist.8.t: "Flight of the Fallen"
turkestan_qadimist.8.d: "Following the decision to pursue legal action against Mustafa Shokay, the grip of justice tightened around the once-powerful leader. Shokay, unwilling to face the consequences of his actions, orchestrated a daring escape from Turkestan. Details emerged of a covert operation that involved trusted confidantes and secret routes.\n\nDespite Shokay's escape, the court proceedings continued. Mustafa Shokay was tried in absentia, symbolically held accountable for the alleged abuses of power during his rule. In the courtroom, Shokay's defense team presented a vigorous case on his behalf, arguing that the charges were politically motivated and a desperate attempt by rivals to tarnish his legacy. They claimed that the former leader had acted within the bounds of executive authority, framing his decisions as necessary measures to maintain stability in a tumultuous time."

turkestan_qadimist.9.t: "A Group of Turkestan 'Refugees'"
turkestan_qadimist.9.d: "This night the soldiers that were closely watching the border with [FROM.GetAdjective] suspected a group of people to be not true 'refugees' from Turkestan, as they had introduced themselves to the Border Guard. Apparently, it happened to be that one of the refugees was closely resembling the ex-president of [FROM.GetName], Mustafa Shokay, who was in hiding due to the criminal procedure against him. After several hours of interrogation, this person made full admission that he really is Mustafa Shokay and he asked for asylum within our country. This case was immediately brought to [ROOT.GetLeader] and the discussion began. Some have suggested that due to our relations with Turkestan we should definetely deliver him to Turkestan authorities. The others, however, suggested that perhaps keeping him in our country means we can later establish a collaboration movement in [FROM.GetName], friendly towards us, as Shokay would likely create an exile movement of his own, considering his great political ambitions."

turkestan_qadimist.10.d: "Mustafa Shokay's escape was short-lived as the [FROM.GetAdjective] border security and government, bound by legal obligations and diplomatic pressure, extradited the fallen leader back to Turkestan. The former powerful ruler found himself in the hands of the very justice system he had tried to evade. Upon his arrival, Shokay was promptly arrested and taken to a courtroom to face the consequences of his actions. With Shokay now present in court, the final phase of a long legal battle began. The charges of power abuse, corruption, and violations of democratic principles were meticulously presented to the judges. As the prosecution and defense made their cases, the nation anxiously awaited the court's decision. The judges deliberated under the weight of public expectations. Their verdict would have a significant impact on Turkestan's future."
turkestan_qadimist.10.a: "Suspence is overwhelming."

turkestan_qadimist.11.t: "Rise of the Exile"
turkestan_qadimist.11.d: "In a dramatic turn of events, Mustafa Shokay emerged from the shadows, boldly stepping into the public eye in the [FROM.GetAdjective] city of [FROM.Capital.GetName]. He declared the creation of the 'Turkestan Democratic Front,' a movement he asserted to be the legitimate voice of exiles committed to restoring stability and order in Turkestan. Shokay's appearance sent shockwaves through the Turkestani government, prompting swift condemnation of the country that had hosted him. The official statement labeled Shokay's actions as an affront to Turkestan's sovereignty and a blatant disregard for the legal processes that had played out in the homeland. The Turkestan government, in a unified response, underscored its commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice prevailed. Shokay's attempt to rally support from abroad was met with skepticism domestically, as many questioned the legitimacy of an exiled movement seeking to influence the affairs of a sovereign nation."
turkestan_qadimist.11.a: "This can lead to diplomatic crisis."

turkestan_qadimist.12.t: "The Conviction"
turkestan_qadimist.12.d: "As the situation in Turkestan becomes more tense, the trial of Mustafa Shokay, the leader of 'Yosh Turkiston,' has become a topic of controversy due to charges of treason and corruption. Unfortunately, the trial has been plagued by procedural violations from the start. The court, under the influence of Madamin Bey, has shown a clear bias throughout the proceedings, which has resulted in a violation of the principles of due process and the right to a fair trial. Throughout the trial, it appears that witnesses may have been coerced, evidence may have been selectively presented, and Shokay's defense may have been obstructed. The testimony of Madamin Bey is presented as the primary source of information, while other evidence or testimonies may have been dismissed. It is possible that political influence may have compromised the judiciary, which may have impacted the outcome of the trial. Although irregularities and violations were noted, Mustafa Shokay has been found guilty of treason and corruption by the court, resulting in a swift and severe sentence of imprisonment. The speed and decisiveness of the judgment have raised concerns, but consequently, Mustafa Shokay is now confined to a prison cell. The ruling government, unchallenged by Shokay's opposition, has been able to consolidate its authority over the nation."

turkestan_qadimist.13.t: "Split Among the Ferghana Government"
turkestan_qadimist.13.d: "After the civil strife settles, it becomes apparent that there are internal tensions within the Provisional Fergana Government. The alliance between the Ferghana Peasant Army, led by Konstantin Monstrov, and the Mujahideen, under the authority of Korshirmat, is strained by ideological differences. This situation could potentially threaten the stability of Madamin Bey's rule. The Ferghana Peasant Army, which has its origins in Russian peasant colonists, has expressed support for Russia and prioritizes the security of their community. This differs from the Mujahideen's commitment to Islamic principles and the state, which is guided by Sharia law. Furthermore, Konstantin Monstrov and Korshirmat have differing opinions on key policy decisions, administrative appointments, and the overall direction of Turkestan's governance."

turkestan_qadimist.14.t: "Suppression of the Turkestan Military Organisation"
turkestan_qadimist.14.d: "In an effort to strengthen its authority and manage pro-Russian groups, Madamin Bey's government has taken action against the Turkestan Military Organization. The crackdown is based on allegations of subversion, collaboration with external actors, and opposition to the Provisional Fergana Government. Security forces have conducted raids, made arrests, and launched propaganda campaigns to dismantle the TVO. Konstantin Monstrov, the leader of the Ferghana Peasant Army, expressed concern over the government's suppression of the TVO, viewing it as a potential violation of the rights of Russophones and a possible precedent for the dominance of Islamic influence. In response, Monstrov mobilized his forces and issued a statement condemning the actions of Madamin Bey. Tensions escalated as the Ferghana Peasant Army openly opposed the government's crackdown. There have been some minor clashes between government forces and the pro-Russian armed faction, which have contributed to the destabilization of the already fragile internal situation within the Provisional Fergana Government."

turkestan_qadimist.15.t: "Turkestan's Coalition Fractures"
turkestan_qadimist.15.d: "Following Madamin Bey's decisive suppression of the Turkestan Military Organization and the subsequent consolidation of power, a rift has emerged within the Ferghana Provisional Government coalition. In a public announcement broadcasted across Turkestan, Konstantin Monstrov declared his opposition to the path taken by Madamin Bey, asserting that the ideals of the Ferghana Provisional Government, forged in the crucible of anti-Bolshevik resistance, are being overshadowed by what he terms as an excessive embrace of Islamism. This internal strife threatens the stability of the newly unified Turkestan. As a reaction, Madamin Bey has immediately appointed even more Korshirmat's Mujahideen to the government and called for their help in a fight against 'yet another Bolsheviks'. He also delivered a public speech, where he condemned Monstrov and highlighted that before their alliance, they were enemies and it was Monstrov who fought for the Red Army and colonisation of Turkestan."

As Madamin Bey consolidates his power, he seeks to fill the void left by Peasant Army with loyal Mujahideen, who have proven their allegiance. In a swift series of actions, key positions within the government and military are reassigned.\n\nHowever, as the new leadership takes shape, the question of the Russian colonists looms large. Their fate and integration into the emerging political landscape become a pressing issue. Most of the new government officials think that Madamin Bey should take a hardline stance by expelling Russian colonists from Turkestan, urging the Russian population to return to Russia or seek refuge elsewhere. On the other hand, some supporters suggest to extend an olive branch to the Russian colonists and grant them a degree of autonomy within designated regions. Without their recognized leader, it is unlikely they will do anything."

turkestan_qadimist.18.d: "Madamin Bey's decision to purge the Mujahideen has truly created a power vacuum that Konstantin Monstrov skillfully exploited. With the remnants of the Turkestan Military Organization (TVO) rallying behind him, Monstrov has orchestrated a swift and efficient coup against Madamin Bey's government. Under the cover of darkness, Monstrov's loyal forces infiltrated key government and military installations, met with little resistance. The tactical brilliance of the operation leads to the capture of Madamin Bey, who finds himself ousted from power. In a public address, Konstantin Monstrov has declared himself the new President of Turkestan, denouncing Madamin Bey's leadership as weak and divisive."

turkestan_qadimist.19.t: "The Fall of Madamin Bey"
turkestan_qadimist.19.d: "Madamin Bey's gamble to prioritize the purge of Konstantin Monstrov over consolidating his own power proved to be a costly miscalculation. The Mujahideen, led by the charismatic Korshirmat, have capitalized on the internal disarray and discontent within Turkestan. As whispers of dissent grow louder among the Mujahideen, Korshirmat has seized the moment to rally his followers and launch a coup against Madamin Bey's government, accompanied by Madamin's old rival, Ergash Bey. In a dramatic turn of events, Madamin Bey finds himself ousted from power as Korshirmat declares the establishment of a new order aligned with the ideals of the Mujahideen."

turkestan_qadimist.20.t: "Fate of Former Monarchs"
turkestan_qadimist.20.d: "In the wake of the collapse of the traditional Khanate and Emirate structures in Khiva and Bukhara, Madamin Bey faces a pivotal decision regarding the fate of former monarchs. The first options is to opt to exile Sayid Abdullah Khan of Khiva and the royal family of Bukhara. This choice would ensur that they pose no threat to the new order established by our rule. Alternatively, Madamin Bey could choose to place the former monarchs under house arrest, allowing them to retain a symbolic role while effectively neutralizing their political influence.\n\nThe final option is to proclaim Madamin Bey as the new Emir of Turkestan, establishing a centralized monarchy under his leadership, as he has already claimed the title of Amir Ul Muslim."
turkestan_qadimist.20.a: "Send them to exile!"
turkestan_qadimist.20.b: "Send them under house arrest, while formally remain monarchs."
turkestan_qadimist.20.c: "There should be only one Emir in Turkestan."

turkestan_qadimist.21.t: "Emir of Fergana"
turkestan_qadimist.21.d: "Korshirmat, the leader of the Mujahideen, has risen to power and declared himself Emir of Ferghana. He is committed to his vision of an Islamic state and draws strength from the teachings of the Quran and the traditions of the Prophet. His goal is to establish an emirate where the principles of Sharia govern the affairs of the state and the lives of its people.  As the new Emir, Korshirmat aims to uphold justice, protect the rights of all citizens, and foster an atmosphere of piety and virtue. He has already taken action by appointing loyal advisors and clerics to key positions of authority to ensure that his vision is implemented at all levels of government. These and subsequent decisions have the potential to bring significant changes to Turkestan."

turkestan_qadimist.22.t: "Gazavat Against Russophiles"
turkestan_qadimist.22.d: "As Emir of Fergana, Korshirmat is determined to rid Turkestan of all traces of Russian influence, which he views as a threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the Islamic state. With the proclamation of Gazavat against the Russians, Korshirmat is preparing to take decisive action against Russophilic organizations and ensure that they are dealt with swiftly. First, a decree is issued banning all Russophilic organizations and activities within the Emirate of Fergana.  Any individuals found to be associated with such groups will face severe penalties, including imprisonment and confiscation of property. Next, the immediate arrest of leaders and prominent members of Russophilic organizations is ordered, accusing them of treason and collaboration with foreign powers. The assets and properties of Russophilic organizations, including TVO and the Peasant Army, are confiscated and redistributed to loyal citizens who uphold the principles of Islamic governance. Finally, Korshirmat orders that colonists be forcibly removed from Turkestan and forbidden to return under penalty of death."

turkestan_qadimist.23.d: "With the rise of secularism and decadence in the once-great Ottoman Empire, the authority of the Caliph in Constantinople has come under scrutiny. Korshirmat must now decide whether to continue his allegiance to the Caliph or take decisive action to assert his own claim as the rightful protector of the Islamic faith."

## ERK events ##
turkestan_socialists.1.t: "Opening of the VI Congress of the ERK"
turkestan_socialists.1.d: "Despite the lingering smell of gunpowder from recent clashes, excitement filled the air in Tashkent for the Sixth Congress of the ERK Party. The grand ceremony marked the party's rise to power in Turkestan and whispers of a new era could be heard in the bustling bazaars. This new era promised to leave behind the echoes of Russian colonialism and ignite the flame of pan-Turkist liberation to guide the way forward. Party leaders Toroqul Januzakov and Turar Ryskulov took to the podium of the former Tashkent City Duma.\n\nThe ERK declared its commitment to socialist ideals and vowed to eliminate the remnants of colonial rule. However, despite the triumph of the revolution, there was a realization that the new socialist government would face stubborn resistance from entrenched elites. Even within the party, which was a loose coalition of various socialist factions and movements in Turkestan, factionalism threatened unity. However, despite the uncertainty, the ceremony marked the beginning of a new era."
turkestan_socialists.1.a: "A new age has truly begun."

turkestan_socialists.2.t: "Two-Party \"Solution\""
turkestan_socialists.2.d: "In a historic turn of events, the ERK party and Milliy Ittihod have engaged in high-stakes negotiations to reshape Turkestan's political landscape. The outcome is the dissolution of Milliy Ittihod and the birth of a new entity — the Popular Front. Under this alliance, Milliy Ittihod is reformed as Milliy Istiklol (National Independence) and officially aligns itself with the ERK, pledging allegiance to socialist ideals. Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, the leader of Milliy Ittihod, remains in charge of the newly-formed Milliy Istiklol. Together with his trusted associates, he aims to integrate the party into the ERK's socialist framework. However, Mustafa Shokay, a former prominent figure within Milliy Ittihod, separates from the newly-formed Popular Front. Voicing opposition to the repressive measures taken against the liberal-jadidist intelligentsia, Shokay vows to establish a movement dedicated to restoring parliamentarism and democracy in Turkestan. The success of these ventures remains uncertain."
turkestan_socialists.2.a: "We have no other 'democracy' for you."

turkestan_socialists.3.t: "Finishing the Revolution"
turkestan_socialists.3.d: "Under the pressure of the RevCom's fervent supporters, the ERK leadership decides to bring the revolution to a close. Turkestan has now become the People's Republic of Turkestan, marking the culmination of the revolution. The ERK enforces a comprehensive ban on all bourgeois parties in Turkestan to consolidate power and eliminate potential counter-revolutionary elements. Furthermore, ERK initiates the establishment of a state structure that aligns with revolutionary ideals. Revolutionary Councils, modeled after the Soviet Union, emerge as the main pillars of governance. These councils are established at various levels to ensure direct representation and participation of the working class and peasantry in decision-making processes. As stated in ERK's official newspaper, a comprehensive socialist education program and cultural revolution will soon be implemented to reshape societal norms and values in alignment with socialist ideals. The end of the revolutionary period signifies the start of a new era for Turkestan, characterized by socialist principles."
turkestan_socialists.3.a: "Long live Liberated Turkestan!"

turkestan_socialists.4.t: "The Poetic Manifesto of the ERK"
turkestan_socialists.4.d: "During the formation of the ERK party in Turkestan, its political program was created by Akhmetzaki Velidi and Toroqul Januzakov. Their goal was to unite the people and create a socialist future. To express these ideals, they enlisted the help of Saitqirey Magazon, whose eloquent writing gave voice to the revolutionary spirit. This poetic manifesto summarizes the ERK's political program, not just as a list of doctrines but as a lyrical tapestry woven with the hopes and aspirations of the people of Turkestan. Magazon's verses resonate as a poetic call to freedom, justice, and the harmonious coexistence of the diverse cultures that define the spirit of Turkestan."

turkestan_socialists.5.t: "The Visionaries of Pan-Turkism"
turkestan_socialists.5.d: "At the sixth congress of the ERK party, Toroqul Januzakov and Turar Ryskulov represented the central faction of the party known as the 'Circle' or 'Tüde'. The name 'Circle' pays homage to the origins of the party, which was originally formed as Turkestan Sosialistlar Tüdesi (Circle of Turkestan Socialists). As the congress progressed, Tüde envisioned a unified Turkestan, grounded in national specificity, fostering a sense of shared cultural heritage among its inhabitants. Januzakov was an active fighter for national power in Turkestan during the civil war. He took a strong stance against Russian expansion and aggression, positioning the party as a defender of Turkestan's liberation and a champion of democratic norms.\n\nTüde consolidated its position within the ERK after receiving overwhelming support at the Sixth Congress. Some critics argue that this position is only temporarily consolidated."
turkestan_socialists.5.a: "True patriots of Turkestan."

turkestan_socialists.6.t: "Turkestan's Revolutionary Vanguard"
turkestan_socialists.6.d: "At the Third Congress of the ERK party, Nazir Toraqulov and his supporters united into a \"Revolutionary Committee\", an oppositional faction. This faction was largely formed from among former supporters of the Turkestan Soviet, as well as from the revolutionary wing of the Young Bukhara Party, which is currently divided between pro-Tüde Usmon Hoja and pro-RevCom Fayzulla Hojaev. Initially adhering to the position of the left SRs on the national question, RevCom diverged from them, emphasizing Islamic socialism. Toraqulov's group places greater emphasis on the principles of Islamic socialism, challenging the secularization policies of their colleagues. The faction also categorically rejects alliances with bourgeois parties such as Milliy Ittihod or other Jadidists, considering democratic means and parliamentarism incompatible with their revolutionary goals. Instead, they favor a one-party solution and a radical transformation of Turkestan, guided by their interpretation of Islamic principles."
turkestan_socialists.6.a: "If there's no revolution, what's the point?"

turkestan_socialists.7.t: "Architect of Turkestani Socialism"
turkestan_socialists.7.d: "During the Sixth Congress of the ERK, Akhmetzaki Velidi stands out as a prominent figure. Velidi has a long history of fighting for autonomy and socialism, starting as the Chief Commander of the Bashkir Host and playing a crucial role in the establishment of independent Bashkurdistan. However, the fall of Bashkurdistan made him realize the limitations of autonomy within the Russian sphere.\n\nIn 1919, inspired by the vision of socialism for Turkic-speaking countries free from Russian influence, Velidi founded the ERK party. His partnership with Toroqul Januzakov led to the creation of Tüde, a socialist powerhouse in Turkestan. While assuming the role of ERK Chairman, Velidi strategically stepped back from directly managing the Turkestan department. Instead, he took on roles as a Commander in the Turkestan Legion (ERK paramilitary forces), historian-Orientalist, and leader of the Bashkir ERK department. His extensive influence extends beyond the party, making him a crucial ally for the ruling Tüde faction. However, Velidi's potential departure to lead the fight for Bashkurdistan's national liberation presents a dilemma. Losing this valuable asset could weaken the main faction's influence, underscoring the delicate balance between Turkestani socialism and broader national liberation aspirations."
turkestan_socialists.7.a: "Truly, a great man."

turkestan_socialists.8.t: "Association of National Movements"
turkestan_socialists.8.d: "One significant faction within the ERK is the 'Association of National Movements,' a coalition that aims to unite various ethnic and national-based groups or parties under the ERK umbrella. The largest components of this faction include the Turkmen Revolutionary People's Party, led by Gaygysyz Atabayev, a prominent leader from the Yomud tribe. Another influential entity associated with the 'Association of National Movements' is the Kazakh Üsh-Jüz party. Various smaller local movements, such as the Kyrgyz Socialist Party \"Bukara\", also contribute to the faction. As the Sixth Congress unfolds, these factions compete for representation and influence, adding depth to the ongoing political discourse within the ERK."
turkestan_socialists.8.a: "Interesting."

turkestan_socialists.9.t: "Velidi's Departure Sparks Power Struggle"
turkestan_socialists.9.d: "As Akhmetzaki Velidi, the party's founder and Chairman, has departed to lead the struggle for Bashkurdistan's independence, the sudden absence of this key figure sends shockwaves through the party leadership, triggering a power struggle.\n\nThe Opposition, seizing the opportunity, demands a re-election of the party chairman, arguing that Velidi's departure has left a void in the ERK's leadership. The call gains momentum as whispers of discontent echo within the ranks. The Tüde, holding a dominant position in the Central Committee, faces a dilemma. Rejecting the demand risks being perceived as weak and could erode their authority. In a surprising turn, the Revolutionary Committee (RevCom) suggests holding party chairman elections on an extraordinary congress in Tashkent, involving a wider section of ERK members. Despite the Tüde's majority in the Central Committee, the potential backlash forces them to reluctantly agree to the proposal.\n\nThe stage is set for a showdown between factions. The looming congress will determine the new party chairman, a position of immense influence and authority. If the Tüde prevails, it will bolster their standing and solidify their dominance. However, a victory for Nazir Toraqulov and the Opposition could mark a significant shift, potentially tipping the scales in favor of the Revolutionary Committee."
turkestan_socialists.9.a: "Interesting, who will win?"

turkestan_socialists.10.t: "Tensions within the Bukharan Socialists"
turkestan_socialists.10.d: "Internal tensions threaten the unity of the revolutionary faction of Young Bukhara - within the ranks of the Bukharan socialists, the fault lines of ethnic, educational, and familial divides are becoming increasingly apparent. At the heart of the discord is a deep-seated rivalry between two prominent figures: Fayzulla Hojaev and Abdulkodyr Muhiddinov. This rivalry is not merely ideological; it is rooted in a longstanding feud between their wealthy families. The escalation of family disputes into an open confrontation intensifies the power struggle within the party. Fayzulla Hojaev, born into the affluent Qasim Sheikh family, carries the legacy of Uzbek millionaire merchants in Bukhara. His unique background, including independent Russian language study and education in Moscow, sets him apart. On the other side of the divide stands Mirza Abdulkodyr Muhiddinov, a scion of the wealthy Muhiddinov family, known for their intellectual pursuits and financial prowess. Fluent in both spoken and written Russian, Abdulkodyr emerges as a formidable figure within the Young Bukharan revolutionaries. As these two influential figures vie for leadership, their personal and familial histories intertwine with the broader struggle for the future direction of the movement. The clash between Fayzulla and Abdulkodyr reflects not only an ideological contest but also the intricate web of relationships, ambitions, and historical grievances shaping the destiny of the Bukharan Socialists."
turkestan_socialists.10.a: "In these circumstances they have will to fight!"

turkestan_socialists.11.t: "The Fundamentalist Problem Sparked Discussion"
turkestan_socialists.11.d: "The recent arrest of Sherali Lapin, a prominent Ulemist affiliated with the Qadimist Ittifoqi Muslimin party, has sparked a heated debate among the top-ranking officials within the ERK about the trajectory of their anti-religious campaigns. With no doubt, Lapin - a moderate, if compared to the radicals. The ruling faction, Tüde, led by Toroqul Januzakov, staunchly advocates for the secularization of Turkestan - a clear separation of Muslim influence from the governance structure, relegating it to the cultural sphere.\n\nOpposing this stance, the advocates of Islamic Socialism within the RevCom faction argue that such an approach risks alienating the predominantly Muslim population of Turkestan. They contend that an overtly secular agenda could cast the ERK in the light of the second coming of Bolsheviks, further fueling resentment among the people. They proceed with the request to release Lapin from prison, but forbid him to pursue any political activities."
turkestan_socialists.11.a: "RevCom's arguments gain traction."
turkestan_socialists.11.b: "Tüde successfully convinces the majority."

turkestan_socialists.12.t: "The Linguistics of Revolution"
turkestan_socialists.12.d: "In the aftermath of the ERK's ascent to power, a momentous decision looms on the horizon — an overhaul of the electoral system to embrace a councilist model. The councilist reforms entail direct elections of Khalq Majlisi delegates by regional councils, elected by local councils and initially represented by the Dehkans and Workers. As the ERK takes steps to dissolve the existing Khalq Majlisi, paving the way for the implementation of this visionary reform, a subtle but significant debate simmers within the party. The core of the debate lies in the naming of the reformed representative body. The Tüde faction contends that the term 'Majlisi,' with its Islamic connotations, should not be retained in a socialist republic. Proposing a shift towards emphasizing Turkic culture, they advocate for renaming it the Khalq Qurultai, translating to People's Congress or Convocation.\n\nOn the opposing end, the RevCom members argue for a focus on systemic changes rather than symbolic alterations. They believe that highlighting the Muslim cultural aspect remains crucial, and the energy should be directed towards transforming the political structure itself rather than a mere change in nomenclature."
turkestan_socialists.12.a: "Change the system, not the name!"
turkestan_socialists.12.b: "Change the system and the name!"

turkestan_socialists.13.t: "Land Redistribution Debate in [TRK_get_majlis_name]"
turkestan_socialists.13.d: "The [TRK_get_majlis_name] reverberates with the echoes of a historic debate on land redistribution, fueled by the fervent voices of the Association of National Movements. Since the adoption of the Land Nationalization Act in 1921, accompanied by the Turkestan Constitution, the state has overseen the distribution of land, ensuring stability and peace in the agricultural sector. However, dissatisfaction simmers within the Association of National Movements, echoing concerns that certain ethnic communities received disproportionately less land compared to the majority Uzbek and Kazakh populations. In their perspective, the hope lies in Januzakov, the country's leader of Kyrgyz origin, understanding the nuances of the issue more profoundly than his counterparts in the RevCom faction, primarily of Kazakh or Uzbek descent. As the debate unfolds, the Association of National Movements itself presses for policies granting ethnic communities more autonomy in land distribution. Prominent Tüde members opt for a compromise that seeks to address the concerns raised by the ANM while maintaining the overall stability achieved by the current system. This middle-ground approach aims to appeal to a broader spectrum of supporters and prevent internal factional rifts. They argue that the special commissions will deal with all land inequality issues separately on a local level. Those aligned with the Revolutionary Committee propose a radical approach focused on combating forehanded farmers, irrespective of their ethnic origin, and promoting voluntary collectivization."
turkestan_socialists.13.a: "Nationalists railroad a resolution."
turkestan_socialists.13.b: "Tüde's balanced approach is taken into account."
turkestan_socialists.13.c: "RevCom steamrolls their draft."

turkestan_socialists.14.t: "Yosh Turkiston"
turkestan_socialists.14.d: "As Mustafa Shokay has refused to join the Milliy Istiklol, he could not longer continue his struggle as a non-partisan politician. Despite threats of arrest and counter-revolutionary activities, Shokay seems to have refused to retreat into political oblivion. Instead, he seized the moment to announce the birth of a new movement — 'Yosh Turkiston,' or 'Young Turkestan'. While embracing Pan-Turkism and emphasizing social unity and stability, Shokay sought to carve a distinct ideological space for his followers - truly an oppositional party, that is unwilling to work under socialist framework. The stage was set for a political showdown, with the former allies now facing off as rivals."
turkestan_socialists.14.a: "Under new legislation, he has committed a crime!"

turkestan_socialists.15.t: "Linguistic Dilemma in Turkestan"
turkestan_socialists.15.d: "A spirited debate ensues within the Central Committee, reflecting the region's rich linguistic tapestry, a mosaic of Turkic and Persian influences. Two distinct approaches have emerged, each finding support within the factions of the ERK. Arguing for the adoption of Turki (Chagatai) language, the Tüde faction argues for reforms that accommodate regional variations, fostering linguistic diversity while maintaining a unified script. However, critics point out that this approach risks marginalizing the Farsi-speaking population of Tajiks.\n\nThe RevCom faction lends its support to a more inclusive vision, advocating for linguistic diversity reflective of Turkestan's multi-ethnic identity. This approach proposes the adoption of multiple official languages based on Chagatai — Kazakh, Uzbek, Karakalpak, Turkmen, and Kyrgyz. Additionally, Farsi is suggested as an official language to address the needs of the Tajik-speaking community. Proponents emphasize the importance of accommodating various linguistic communities to foster unity."
turkestan_socialists.15.a: "Adopt Farsi and reformed Chagata!"
turkestan_socialists.15.b: "Adopt several official languages."

turkestan_socialists.16.t: "Embracing the Latin Script"
turkestan_socialists.16.d: "In the wake of the government's commitment to linguistic reform and modernization, the question of script now takes center stage. Building upon the previous decision to adopt Farsi and Chagatai as official languages alongside regional ones, the ERK now faces the monumental task of deciding on a standardized script. In the spirit of embracing Westernization and echoing the reforms of Mustafa Kemal, the leadership is contemplating the adoption of the Latin script. As the ERK consolidates its commitment to a diverse linguistic landscape with Farsi and Chagatai as key components, the proposal to shift to the Latin script gains prominence. This move is seen as a natural progression, aligning with the broader ethos of modernization while retaining the essence of linguistic diversity. Advocates argue that the Latin script will not only enhance communication but also symbolize Turkestan's integration with global progress."
turkestan_socialists.16.d2: "In the wake of the government's commitment to linguistic reform and modernization, the question of script now takes center stage. Building upon the previous decision to adopt all Turkestan's languages as official, the ERK now faces the monumental task of deciding on a standardized script. In the spirit of embracing Westernization and echoing the reforms of Mustafa Kemal, the leadership is contemplating the adoption of the Latin script for Turkestan's languages. This move, while seen as a departure from tradition, is presented as a practical step towards unifying the diverse linguistic communities under a common script. Proponents argue that the Latin script offers a neutral ground, fostering better communication and understanding among Turkestan's varied linguistic groups."
turkestan_socialists.16.a: "Latin script is the script of the Internationale!"

turkestan_socialists.17.t: "Brothers-In-Law" #Шурин и Зять
turkestan_socialists.17.d2: "The bond between Toroqul Januzakov and Turar Ryskulov goes beyond political alliances, extending to familial ties that have deep roots in their shared past. As brothers-in-law, their relationship has been woven into the fabric of their lives, connecting them on a personal and profound level. Friendship between Toroqul and Turar began in the formative years of their childhood. Graduating together from the Merke Russian-Indigenous boarding school in 1909, they forged a friendship that transcended the confines of educational institutions. Their connection to Talas, a place they often visited as boys, further strengthened the foundation of their camaraderie.\n\nUnited by a shared vision of a better future for the people of Turkestan, Toroqul Januzakov and Turar Ryskulov embarked on a journey of active struggle in 1917. Their friendship, nurtured through years of shared experiences, became a cornerstone of their collaborative efforts to bring positive change to Turkestan. As brothers-in-law and lifelong friends, Toroqul and Turar's relationship stands as a testament to the enduring bonds that can emerge from shared dreams and common goals."
turkestan_socialists.17.d: "$turkestan_socialists.17.d2$\n\nTheir unbreakable bond, however, has become a focal point for whispers and side glances within the ERK party. As the party grapples with the vacancy left by Akhmetzaki Validi's departure for Bashkurdistan, the spotlight turns to Ryskulov, who harbors aspirations of filling the vacant chairman's seat. The RevCom faction, ever watchful for opportunities to advance their agenda, seizes upon the situation to cast shadows of doubt over Ryskulov's suitability for the role. The air is thick with insinuations of nepotism, and the faction strategically questions whether the ERK can afford to pass the leadership baton within the confines of a family connection."

turkestan_socialists.19.t: "Confrontation with Russophilic Organisations"
turkestan_socialists.19.d: "In order to limit the influence of the Turkestan Military Organization and the Ferghana Peasant Army, the government opted for direct confrontation. Not only were the movements officially banned, but they were also declared counter-revolutionary and reactionary, and thus had to be liquidated. The mopping up of the Ferghana Valley was fairly quick, as Monstrov was not hiding. A short battle ensued, after which the commander of the Russian settlers surrendered and his most active supporters were detained. The Monstrov case was expected to become a show trial of \"Russian colonialism\".\n\nThe situation with the Turkestan military organization was much more serious. They had deep political ties with various groups both inside and outside Turkestan, but one thing was certain - they were hiding in New Tashkent, and with control of that region established, the fate of the TVO hung in the balance. After a brief operation by the Turkestan Legion, the headquarters was found and the extremists inside were eliminated. Most of the TVO leadership were arrested as agents of Russian intelligence and will be tried for espionage and attempted coup d'état, however, some of them are still operating."

turkestan_socialists.20.t: "Question of the Russian Colonists"
turkestan_socialists.20.d: "A significant issue that requires attention is the presence of Russian colonists who were relocated to Turkestan during the Stolypin reform. After 30 years, many of them have become prosperous landowners and farmers. Although land was nationalized throughout Turkestan in 1921, the area under the control of the Fergana Peasant Army still adhered to the old orders. Now we must decide what to do with the colonists.\n\nThe Revolutionary Committee proposed a rigid, Marxist approach from the point of view of socialist economy. We must immediately nationalize their lands, as they belong to a pest class of Kulaks, that has no ethnicity. Russian kulaks, on a par with other citizens of Turkestan, will receive redistributed land or can voluntarily join collective farms.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Tüde faction, there are other options, such as national-cultural autonomy, voluntary repatriation to Russia, and the nationalization of the lands of Russian colonists. Alternatively, colonists from Turkestan, who represent Great Russian imperialism and colonialism, and have no place in modern times, could be forcibly resettled."

Instead, the reforms, promoted and implemented on behalf of the RevCom factions were vital for the delegates to choose precisely Toraqulov brothers. While their service for the Bolsheviks was forgotten and forgiven long ago, Nazir Toraqulov, an ethnic Kazakh, rises to power as the nation's new chairman."
turkestan_socialists.23.d2: "Despite initial expectations that this Congress would bring radical change to the Central Committee, it was not entirely true. Some minor reshuffle in the CC was present, but the majority was still taken by the Tüde faction. Toroqul Januzakov has once again secured his position as the party's chairman."
turkestan_socialists.23.d3: "Despite initial expectations that this Congress would bring radical change to the Central Committee, it was not entirely true. Instead, the Central Commitee became split almost 50/50 between Revcom and Tüde members and the candidacy of Januzakov was not approved for the position of the chairman. After long debates, it was decided that a compromise candidate would be appointed - namely, Turar Ryskulov. While many supporters of RevCom suggest that appointing Januzakov's right hand symbolizes the final victory of ERK, the appointment of RevCom ministers to various important positions, perhaps, changed their minds."
turkestan_socialists.23.a: "Congratulate the new CC."

turkestan_socialists.24.t: "Turkestan Socialists Seek Asylum"
turkestan_socialists.24.d: "With the Turkestan Socialist party finally destroyed in Turkestan, their exiled leaders are now asking for asylum in our country. What shall we do?"
turkestan_socialists.24.a: "We welcome all those who struggle for people!"
turkestan_socialists.24.b: "Send them away!"

turkestan_socialists.25.t: "Hoja or Hojaev?"
turkestan_socialists.25.d: "With our natural ally, Usmon Hoja, taking power in Bukhara, his party has recently come across serious intra-party factionalism. The leader of the revolutionary wing, Fayzulla Hojaev, closely aligned to the RevCom faction has demanded radical re-organisation of the government. We have political power and will to intervene into their conflict and help one of them to take power."
turkestan_socialists.25.a: "Back Hoja, he's our man."
turkestan_socialists.25.b: "Revcom successfully insists on supporting Hojaev."

turkestan_socialists.26.t: "ERK Pressures Our Government"
turkestan_socialists.26.d: "Our coalition allies from ERK in Turkestan have pressured us to give in to Hojaev's demands. With their unprecedented intervention into our affairs, we must obey."
turkestan_socialists.26.a: "Is this the end of democracy?"

turkestan_socialists.27.t: "ERK Supports Our Government"
turkestan_socialists.27.d: "Our coalition allies from ERK in Turkestan have supported Hoja and reprimanded Hojaev of his unconstitutional demands. It seems that finally people's democracy will win."
turkestan_socialists.27.a: "Hojaev is no longer to command!"

turkestan_socialists.28.t: "ERK Influence Spreads"
turkestan_socialists.28.d: "Due to recent tragic events in Bukhara, the Young Bukhara movement has convened a secret congress in order to discuss their further strategy. It was decided that the fight should go on in a more radical way. Abdulvohid Burhonov, long-time leader of the party was forced to give up his chairmanship, leading to the Fayzulla Hojaev and Usmon Hoja, proponents of the revolutionary faction of the party to take leadership. In this circumstances, Fayzulla Hojaev was elected the new chairman of the party, meaning that the Young Bukharan Movement has been now consolidated under the socialist banners."
turkestan_socialists.28.a: "Bloody Bukharan regime will pay for their crimes!"
turkestan_socialists.28.b: "Young Bukharans are a threat to regional stability!"

turkestan_socialists.29.t: "Nisar Muhammad Yousafzai Leaves For Afghanistan"
turkestan_socialists.29.d: "The overwhelming resistance against Saqqawist rule in Afghaistan has triumphed - Abdul Ghaffar Khan has rallied his Redshirts along with the remaining anti-Saqqawist resistance, have marched into Kabul in order to free Afghanistan from tyranny. As Pashtuns raise a crimson banner over Afghanistan, member of the Milliy Harakatlar Ittifoqi (Association of National Movements) faction within the ERK party, Nisar Muhammad Yousafzai, who has long been in exile in Turkestan, has left our country in order to fight for socialism in Afghanistan."
turkestan_socialists.29.a: "Congratulate him and wish him good luck!"

turkestan_socialists.30.t: "Opening of the 7th Congress"
turkestan_socialists.30.d: "With Khiva and Turkestan finally falling under our control, it was wise to decide the further steps of the party and our nation. In Tashkent, the ERK has announced the 7th Congress to be held soon, and as various delegates arrive in the capital city, many understand that this Congress would be a special one. It is understood that the majority faction, either RevCom or Tüde, will do anything to win a majority in the Central Commitee, perhaps, changing Turkestan forever."
turkestan_socialists.30.a: "Greet the concourse."

turkestan_socialists.32.t: "The New Central Commitee"
turkestan_socialists.32.d: "While the ERK's struggle failed in Turkestan, the country was liberated by the Young Bukhara revolutionaries, and major figures of the ERK, like Toroqul Januzakov or Turar Ryskulov were forced to withdraw their candidacies from the Chairmanship. Instead, two leaders of Young Bukhara - Fayzulla Hojaev and Usmon Hoja are running to take this office. While the most likely candidate to be elected is [ROOT.GetLeader], it is not guaranteed, as the delegates are currently divided 50/50. On one hand, Fayzulla Hojaev is supported by the RevCom leadership, but on the other hand, Usmon Hoja is aligned to the ruling Tüde faction of ERK.\n\nEventually, it became clear that Hoja has the majority of delegates behind him, meaning his opponent will lose the game. The new CC was elected, securing Tüde's victory."
turkestan_socialists.32.a: "The Congress appoints Usmon Hoja."

turkestan_socialists.35.d: "While the ERK's struggle failed in Turkestan, the country was liberated by the Kyrgyz socialist party, and major figures of the ERK, like Nazir Toraqulov or Turar Ryskulov were forced to withdraw their candidacies from the Chairmanship. Instead, two leaders compete - Imanaly Aydarbekov and Toroqul Januzakov, both ethnic Kyrgyz, are running to take this office. However, the most likely candidate to be elected is not [ROOT.GetLeader], but the leader of ERK."
turkestan_socialists.35.a: "The Congress appoints Toroqul Januzakov!"

turkestan_socialists.36.t: "Ishaq Bey Wishes to Join ERK"
turkestan_socialists.36.d: "After the fall of East Turkestan, Ishaq Bey, an ethnic Kyrgyz leader from Jigin, has reached our government and asked to join our party, together with his loyalists. While he went to Russia during the Revolution and became a follower of Marxism, he's still a socialist and Pan-Turkist, and, perhaps, having ties with him is what we need to successfully liberate East Turkestan later."
turkestan_socialists.36.d2: "After the fall of East Turkestan, Ishaq Bey, an ethnic Kyrgyz leader from Jigin, has reached our government and asked to join our party, together with his loyalists. While he went to Russia during the Revolution and became a follower of Marxism, he's still a socialist, and, perhaps, having ties with him is what we need to successfully liberate China's Kyrgyz people."
turkestan_socialists.36.a: "We will require assistance when we set our brothers free in China."
turkestan_socialists.36.b: "He is merely a Bolshevik, decline his offer!"

turkestan_socialists.37.t: "The Turkic People's National Liberation Committee"
turkestan_socialists.37.d: "Our refusal to assist Ishaq Bey proved to be well-founded — this covert communist eventually encountered opposition within his own movement. The heart of this opposition lay in the person of Ehmetjan Qasim, a young revolutionary hailing from our own ranks of ERK party, but originally from Ghulja, East Turkestan.\n\nIn the early 1930s, during his student days, he came to Tashkent to pursue his studies at Turkestan State University (formerly known as the People's University). There, he swiftly integrated into the socialist circles within our party and emerged as one of the prominent leaders of the youth organization of East Turkestan, which united students from China aspiring for their homeland's liberation from Qing rule.\n\nWhen the struggle for independence in East Turkestan commenced, he journeyed there and assumed a prominent position within the Ishaq Bey's faction, advocating for the tenets of the East Turkestan Republic movement. In essence, Ehmetjan assumed leadership of the syndicalist branch of the party, in contrast to the communist faction, and through the support of our esteemed leaders, he managed to split Ishaq Bey's movement, founding his own, which our government was ready to recognize as the legitimate representative of all East Turkestan."
turkestan_socialists.37.a: "ERK brings freedom, unlike the Bolsheviks."

turkestan_socialists.38.t: "The Coup in [ETS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
turkestan_socialists.38.d: "Having established diplomatic and amicable relations with [ETS.GetNameDef] and its leader Ishaq Bey, the government immediately commenced to forge closer ties, so to speak. In essence, we are discussing the integration of East Turkestan as an autonomous republic within our unified Turkic state. Regrettably, we did not receive the response we anticipated from the steadfast Marxist Ishaq Bey, despite the assistance we provided to the Young Turkestan Party in their quest for freedom. Consequently, it was determined to \"push\" the government into engaging in dialogue. However, for this purpose, we required individuals who were loyal to us, and Ehmetjan Qasim emerged as such an individual. He was a young revolutionary hailing from our own ERK party ranks but originating from Ghulja in East Turkestan.\n\nIn the early 1930s, as a student, he arrived in Tashkent with the intention of pursuing his studies at the Turkestan State University (formerly known as the People’s University). There, he quickly became immersed in the socialist circles of our party and rose to prominence as one of the leading figures in the youth organisation of East Turkestan, uniting students from China who sought to liberate their homeland from Qing rule. As the struggle for independence in East Turkestan intensified, he travelled to the region and assumed a pivotal position within the faction led by Ishaq Bey, championing the principles of the East Turkestan Republican movement. Ehmetjan, essentially, took the lead in the syndicalist wing of the party, contrasting it with the communist faction. With the support of our esteemed leaders, he successfully split the movement led by Ishaq Bey and founded his own faction, which our government recognised as the legitimate voice of East Turkestan.\n\nBy the time the military units of our army had entered [ETS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Ishaq Bey had been apprehended by the newly formed revolutionary government under the leadership of Qasim. Our task now is to ensure a tranquil transition without any bloodshed, despite the occasional skirmishes with loyalist factions of Ishaq Bey. Taking advantage of the extraordinary popularity of Toroqul Januzakov among the Kyrgyz population, the disturbances were swiftly quelled."
turkestan_socialists.38.d2: "Having established diplomatic and amicable relations with [FROM.GetNameDef], their government immediately commenced to forge closer ties, so to speak. In essence, they were speaking of integration of East Turkestan as an autonomous republic within their realm. Regrettably, their leaders did not receive the response we anticipated for our sovereignty and independence. Consequently, the so-called 'liberators of Turks' decided to act with strength.\n\nWe received a blow from our own ranks. Ehmetjan Qasim, elected as our Foreign Minister, and leader of the syndicalist wing of our movement, has successfully split our party into factions, and rallied much of Ishaq Bey's own supporters to his side. Clearly acting on behalf of [FROM.Capital.GetName], Qasim's revolutionaries arrested Ishaq Bey today in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nAs we anticipated, Simultaneously the military units of [FROM.GetNameDef] have crossed the border and joined their struggle. Unfortunately, all the disturbances were swiftly quelled and the power in our country is now secured by the opposition!"

turkestan_socialists.39.t: "Validi's Victory in Bashkurdistan"
turkestan_socialists.39.d: "Following several weeks of intense internal political strife in Bashkurdistan, Akhmetzaki Validi, our esteemed leader and patron, emerged victorious in a fierce struggle, with his forces firmly controlling the entirety of Bashkir territory. In light of this development, the leadership of the ERK in Turkestan proposed the idea of unification between our two countries. However, representatives of the opposition vehemently opposed this proposal, arguing that Bashkir autonomy remains distant from our reach, and that Russia would undoubtedly assert its dominance in the event of Bashkirian reintegration. Concerned about potential escalation, they implored us to refrain from any declarations until Turkestan itself is fully under our control."

turkestan_socialists.40.b: "Their power is still unstable, first we must subdue the Steppe."

turkestan_socialists.41.t: "Betrayal of Turkestan ERK"
turkestan_socialists.41.d: "When the news of our triumph reached Tashkent, it elicited an unexpected response — in fact, a treacherous one. The leadership of the Turkestan branch of the party repudiated its alliance with us and severed ties. Despite many years of joint struggle against the oppressive Turkestan regime and Russian colonial domination, all of this was forgotten as soon as Validi left Turkestan.\n\nNews of the treachery of our fellow Turks immediately reached the ears of our incensed Bashkir comrades and colleagues, who had been prepared to lay down their lives for the liberation of the United Turkestan. It seems clear that we must now lead this struggle, and that all of Turkestan, including those who have betrayed the revolution, will be freed and purged."
turkestan_socialists.41.a: "They will pay for this betrayal!"

turkestan.2.d: "The tranquil mountain region of East Pamir is gripped by chaos as the Mujahideen divisions launch a violent uprising against our Jadidist rule. In an attempt to discredit our government, these insurgents have resorted to heinous acts of robbery and murder, causing widespread fear and instability among the local populace. The situation demands urgent attention and decisive action to quell the insurgency before it engulfs the entire region.\n\nAs reports of the Mujahideen's actions continue to escalate, suspicions arise that the Bukharan Karaul-begi, Ibrahim-Bey, may be behind this unrest. His clandestine support to the insurgents has emboldened their cause, making it even more imperative to swiftly crush the insurgency and restore peace to the troubled region."
turkestan.2.a: "Reinforce our Guard there."

turkestan.3.t: "Clashes Between Army and Mujahideen"
turkestan.3.d: "The rebels in the East Pamir region had attempted to engage into armed conflict with our army, fighting back and entrenching in the mountains.

turkestan.4.d: "The Turkestan government is now struggling to deal with the revolt in East Pamir region, the insurgency of the local Mujahideen divisions, trying to overthrow the democratic government in all of Turkestan.\n\nNow they have addressed the Emir and Kashbegi in order to receive some support in weapons and ammunition to fight back the Turkestan government.\n\nWe can fund their operations and hope that they will effectively fight against Turkestan, however, some of the Emir's advisors believe that this is can be exposed by the Turkestan government, which can lead to a major political scandal and the aggravation of relations between our countries.\n\nThe Kashbegi, on the other hand, believes that we should support any force that fights against pro-Russian government."

turkestan.5.d: "There have been reports about the liberalisation of Khiva's regime. It seems that Mujahideen have lost their power in Khiva, becoming a serious threat to Mujahideen and Qadimist influence. It seems that now Sho'roi Ulamo can only rely on Bukhara."

turkestan.8.d: "The [UZB.GetName] has recently had to deal with socialist insurgency in the Karshi region.

Even now as we speak, that marxist devil snakes his way through our lands, untethered by morals or law."
turkestan.8.d.erk: "The [UZB.GetName] has recently had to deal with socialist insurgency in the Karshi region.

turkestan.50.t: "Evidence on Bukharan Support of Rebels"
turkestan.50.d: "We have exposed that the Emirate of Bukhara is sponsoring Mujahideen revolt in East Pamir by sending them ammunition and supplies. As the evidence unfolded, it painted a damning picture of Bukhara's interference in Turkestan's internal affairs. Ammunition and supplies flowed clandestinely from Bukhara to the Mujahideen, undermining stability and sowing discord within Turkestan. The question loomed: how should Turkestan respond to this breach of trust and violation of sovereignty?"
turkestan.50.a: "Condemn Bukhara's actions"

turkestan.52.t: "Turkestan's Show of Strength"
turkestan.52.d: "The city of Bukhara, bathed in the warm hues of sunset, stood as a silent witness to the brewing storm across its northern borders. The Emirate found itself thrust into a new era of uncertainty as Turkestan flexed its military muscle. The Emir, resplendent in his traditional attire, presided over an emergency council in the opulent chambers of the Ark Fortress. The air was thick with tension as advisors and military commanders weighed the gravity of Turkestan's actions. In the bustling bazaars of Bukhara, where traders had peddled wares for centuries, a palpable unease settled. The vibrant marketplaces, once alive with the cadence of commerce, now buzzed with hushed conversations and worried glances. Military strategists, their faces etched with concern, unfurled maps detailing the land between Bukhara and Turkestan. Contingency plans were devised, not only to counter potential aggression but also to navigate the complex web of alliances that could shape the emirate's destiny."
turkestan.52.a: "Damn."

turkestan.60.t: "1st Extraordinary Congress of the National Guard General Staff"
turkestan.60.d: "A biting chill swept through the high chambers of the National Guard General Staff headquarters, nestled in the heart of [Capital.GetName]. It was the 1st Extraordinary Congress, a gathering of strategic minds that marked a crucial moment in Turkestan's response to the East Pamir Revolt. The grand hall, adorned with maps and charts, was abuzz with anticipation. The agenda sprawled across the vast table like a topographic map. The primary focus was the Korshirmat's revolt, dissecting the challenges posed by the Mujahideen and formulating a response that would resonate through the peaks and valleys. Fortifying Fergana was a consensus, but the crux lay in deciding the approach—bold aggression or covert subversion.\n\nAs the congress unfolded, seasoned commanders, strategists, and advisors filled the hall. The scent of coffee and the rustle of maps being unfurled blended with the gravity of the discussions. The Mujahideen had entrenched themselves, forming an \"Islamic Government of Fergana", casting a menacing shadow over the once-peaceful region. The Turkestan government, facing a rising storm, convened a military congress to strategize its response. As the congress unfolded, voices echoed within the chamber, each articulating a different approach to quell the rebellion. General Ergash Bey, a seasoned military leader, head of the Mirshabs, stood before the gathered officials, maps spread across the table, tracing the contours of East Pamir. \"Our forts in Fergana are our first line of defense,\" he declared, his finger emphasizing critical points on the map. \"Reinforcing these bastions will send a clear message — we are resolute in maintaining order.\" The assembly listened, divided between those advocating a swift military offensive and others wary of the potential consequences. The discussion surged like a mountain river, tumultuous and unyielding. The room hushed as the choice presented itself like a fork in a treacherous mountain path. A daring proposal emerged to take the fight directly to the heights of the Mujahideen stronghold in the East Pamir Mountains: \"We scale their heights, catch them off guard, and reclaim control.\"\n\nA more covert approach suggested deploying specialized units to infiltrate the canyons and valleys of East Pamir: \"Strike from the shadows, disrupt their supply lines, and instill fear.\"
turkestan.60.a: "Launch a bold offensive in the mountains."
turkestan.60.b: "Guerilla tactics and ambush."

turkestan.61.t: "The Fateful Appeal"
turkestan.61.d: "Facing a mounting crisis in East Pamir, President Shokay's government in Turkestan reaches out to Russia, requesting military aid to quell the insurgency. The decision hangs in the balance, with potential consequences that could reshape the geopolitical landscape of the region. [Capital.GetName] is presented with a delicate choice. On one hand, intervening in Turkestan's internal conflict could stabilize the situation and prevent the region from descending further into chaos. This option, however, comes with significant risks—any perceived Russian interference might spark internal unrest within Turkestan, with accusations of puppetry and a loss of national autonomy. If we choose to assist Turkestan, our forces will be mobilized and deployed to East Pamir. The operation would be framed as a joint effort to maintain stability in the region, but can also stir discontent among Turkestan's population, leading to protests and accusations of compromising national sovereignty. We can always refrain from intervening, citing Turkestan's internal affairs. This choice will maintain the appearance of respecting Turkestan's sovereignty but risks the instability in East Pamir spiraling out of control. It also leaves Turkestan to handle the crisis alone, potentially straining the relationship between our nations."
turkestan.61.a: "Extend a 'helping' hand."
turkestan.61.b: "Further instability in Turkestan is a key to our success."

turkestan.62.t: "The Unwelcome Intervention"
turkestan.62.d: "In a surprising turn of events, President Shokay's government has reached out to Russia, seeking military assistance to quell the unrest in East Pamir, as promised in Tashkent Accords. The announcement has sparked controversy and accusations of puppetry. In the capital, [Capital.GetName], dissenting voices echo through the streets. Protesters gather, condemning what they perceive as a surrender of Turkestan's sovereignty to Russian interests. Opposition leaders decry Shokay as a puppet, accusing him of betraying the ideals of an independent Turkestan. Despite the domestic backlash, Russian military units swiftly deploy to East Pamir. The rugged terrain becomes a battleground as the well-equipped Russian forces engage the Mujahideen. A series of decisive actions sees the rebellion crushed, with the Mujahideen leader forced to flee, marking the end of the East Pamir crisis.\n\nAs the dust settles in East Pamir, concerns grow about the expanding influence of Russia in Turkestan. Critics argue that the military intervention not only quelled the rebellion but also paved the way for increased Russian involvement in Turkestan's internal affairs. The move raises questions about Shokay's commitment to true independence and fuels suspicions of a burgeoning pro-Russian puppet regime."
turkestan.62.a: "At least... we won."

turkestan.63.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Intervene!"
turkestan.63.d: "In the face of turmoil in East Pamir, Turkestan's plea for Russian intervention is met with a resounding refusal. In a terse response, Russia declares that the unrest in East Pamir is an internal matter for Turkestan to address. The decision is met with mixed reactions, as some see it as a respect for national sovereignty, while others interpret it as a reluctance to extend support. President Shokay, facing mounting pressure from both within and outside his government, addresses the nation. He acknowledges the Russian decision, expressing disappointment but emphasizing Turkestan's commitment to resolving its internal challenges independently. The rejection by Russia leaves Turkestan to grapple with the East Pamir crisis without external military support. The opposition seizes on this opportunity, intensifying their criticism of Shokay's leadership. Protests erupt across some regions of the country, demanding a more robust response to the insurgency."

turkestan.64.t: "Bombardment of Osh"
turkestan.64.d: "The aerial bombardment of East Pamir leaves Turkestan's skies scarred, as the government's military strategy takes a devastating toll on the region. The aftermath paints a haunting picture of tragedy, dissent, and the shifting sands of public opinion. In a bid to quell the Mujahideen insurgency in East Pamir, the Turkestan government authorized a relentless aerial bombardment. The primary target was the southern part of Osh, believed to house the regional headquarters of the Korshirmat's 'Army of Islam'. Russian-built 'Tupolev' bombers soar through the clouds, unleashing a torrent of destruction upon the town. The calculated strikes, aimed at disrupting rebel operations and supply routes, result in widespread devastation. The central square of Osh, justified as a military target due to its strategic significance, becomes a grim battleground in the sky. The fallout was catastrophic, with reports confirming the loss of 209 lives in the bombing raid. The once-bustling streets of Osh now bear witness to the anguish of a grieving community. The tragedy resonates deeply, echoing through the narrow alleys and open squares that were once vibrant with life.\n\nNews of the aerial bombardment fans the flames of discontent within Turkestan. Citizens grapple with the moral implications of such a drastic military response. The widening rift between those who view it as a necessary evil for national security and those who condemn it as an indiscriminate act of violence becomes palpable. Even within the government, murmurs of criticism emerge. Some officials question the planning and precision of the strikes, fearing the collateral damage may breed resentment and fuel the insurgency further. As dissent simmers behind closed doors, the leadership grapples with the complexities of navigating a delicate balance between security and public sentiment."

turkestan.65.t: "Victory in the Mountains"
turkestan.65.d: "The government forces, employing a combination of strategic planning, specialized forces, and aerial support, achieved significant victories in the East Pamir region. The town of Osh, a strategic gateway, fell to the advancing forces, disrupting the Mujahideen's connections to the broader Turkestan and Fergana Valley. The mountaineer efforts and the expertise of special forces played a crucial role in the success, allowing the government forces to navigate the challenging terrain and neutralize the insurgents. Aerial support, including precise bombings, contributed to the efficiency of the operations. In a decisive move, the last stronghold of the Mujahideen, the town of Murghab, was also liberated. The combined efforts on the ground and from the air led to the expulsion of the insurgents from this critical region. However, the leaders, including the influential figure Korshirmat, managed to evade capture, fleeing the region before the government forces could apprehend them. Their current whereabouts remain unknown, raising concerns about potential regrouping or seeking refuge in other countries. Despite this, the successful military operations mark a significant step toward stabilizing the East Pamir region."
turkestan.65.a: "Victory!"

turkestan.66.t: "Coup of the White Guard"
turkestan.66.d: "In the high mountainous terrain of the East Pamir, where the air thins and echoes carry for miles, discontent had been brewing for over 250 days. The government's feeble attempts to suppress the relentless insurgency had only fueled the flames of rebellion. Unbeknownst to the ruling elite, a hidden force was silently preparing to seize the reins of power. General-major Ivan Zaitsev, a seasoned officer with a reputation for cunning strategy, led the Turkestan Military Organisation (TVO). Hiding beneath the radar, the TVO had patiently gathered resources, won over sympathizers, and patiently awaited the opportune moment to strike. As the snow-capped peaks, flourishing valleys and cloistral glades stood witness to the unfolding drama, Zaitsev initiated a meticulously planned coup. The first whispers of discontent were sown among disillusioned military units, discontented civilians, and even sympathetic members of the ruling party. The cloak of secrecy that shrouded the TVO's operations only deepened the mystery surrounding their intentions.\n\nIn the dead of night, with a strategic precision that spoke of months of clandestine preparation, the TVO struck. Key industrial and transportation hubs fell under their control like pieces on a chessboard. The Fergana Valley, a prized jewel, was the next domino to fall, bringing the TVO closer to its ultimate goal. The support from unexpected quarters was one of the coup's most intriguing facets. Konstantin Monstrov, leader of the Fergana Peasant Army, found common cause with the TVO, supporting them instantly. Surprisingly, even among the Muslim population, there were those who saw the TVO as potential liberators from the shackles of an ineffective government.\n\nNews of the coup spread like wildfire. The elusive TVO, once hidden in the shadows, now emerged as the architects of Turkestan's destiny. Towns and cities, which had endured the relentless insurgency, were now subject to a shift in power dynamics. The Mujahideen forces, long ensconced in the insurgency zone, found themselves scattered and fleeing from an unpredictable fate. While some hailed the TVO as heroes, a beacon of hope in troubled times, others viewed them with trepidation. The specter of pro-Russian sentiments loomed large over the unfolding narrative. Whispers circulated that the TVO would usher in a regime that mirrored the dark days of colonial rule, wielding fear and terror as instruments of control."

turkestan.67.t: "Coup of the Mirshabs"
turkestan.67.d: "Despite the government's attempts to quell the Mirshab insurgency, the streets of Turkestan continued to resonate with the rhythm of dissent. Ergash Bey, the enigmatic leader of the Mirshabs, orchestrated a symphony of defiance that proved too potent for the government to silence. Turkestan, already weathering internal divisions, found itself teetering on the precipice of chaos. In the turbulent shadows, Ergash Bey seized the moment with a calculated precision. Emboldened by the government's inability to suppress the Mirshab revolt, he orchestrated a coup d'état. In a swift and audacious move, Ergash Bey's forces, comprised of loyal Mirshabs and sympathizers, infiltrated key governmental institutions. The coup, with strategic maneuvers and political alliances forged in the crucible of rebellion, secured the support of Ittifoqi Muslimin. Ergash Bey, once the field commander of the Mirshabs, now ascended to the throne of leadership. The government, caught off guard and hampered by internal dissent, succumbed to the tidal wave of change. As the dust settled, Turkestan woke to a new reality — one shaped by the hand of Ergash Bey. The Mirshab leader, now at the helm, faced the daunting task of steering a fractured nation. The coup not only marked the failure of the government to control its own instruments of order but also heralded a new chapter under the leadership of its newfound helmsman."

Now, however, mass democratic demonstrations have taken place in the center of Tashkent, heralding the triumph of the Milliy Ittihod against the ERK government. The protracted crisis finally came to an end when the government took control of key institutions, dismantling the remnants of the ERK administration. As a result, red and blue flags were restored over administrative buildings in Tashkent, marking the restoration of stability."
turkestan.68.d: "Amidst the grandeur of the Eastern Pamir range, Milliy Ittihod's troops began a difficult campaign against the entrenched Mujahideen government. In the midst of hostilities, Milliy Ittihod conducted complex diplomatic negotiations with local leaders and influential figures in the Eastern Pamirs. Given the region's diverse ethnic and tribal characteristics, alliances were forged to undermine the Mujahideen's power. When the red and blue flags of Turkestan flew over the liberated expanses of the Eastern Pamirs, the victory was not only a military victory, but also a testament to successful diplomacy.

turkestan.72.d: "As whispers of resistance grew louder in the Russian settlements, Konstantin Monstrov, the charismatic head of the Fergana Peasant Army, emerged from the shadows. His influence over the disgruntled Russian settlers reached its peak, culminating in a coup. The government's attempts to navigate the delicate balance between the interests of various ethnic groups unraveled in the face of the resolute opposition from the Russian settlers. Their protests, initially confined to the streets, evolved into a coordinated rebellion led by Monstrov. The Fergana Peasant Army, now a rallying point for those opposed to the government's policies, swelled in numbers. Monstrov, a shrewd tactician, orchestrated a series of strategic moves that paralyzed the government. With each passing day, the grip of the authorities weakened, and the once-stable Turkestan plunged into uncertainty. As the Russian settlers rallied behind the banner of the Fergana Peasant Army, their discontent fused with a broader sentiment of disillusionment with the government. The coup, executed with precision and popular support, saw Monstrov ascend to a position of power. The government, grappling with internal strife and external pressures, failed to quell the uprising. The unintended consequences of the repatriation policy had not only fractured the nation but had now placed it in the hands of a leader who sought to reshape its destiny."

Under their leadership and direct involvement, the Osipov uprising took place in Tashkent, dealing a decisive blow to Bolshevism in Turkestan.\n\nNow, the leader of this organisation, Ivan Zaitsev — a fellow countryman of ours, former commander of the 4th Isetsko-Stavropol Regiment of the Orenburg Cossack Host, and former commander of Russian troops in Khiva — has appealed to us, asking for assistance and the integration of TVO units into our ranks."

Turkestan was no exception, where our largest city and industrial center, Tashkent, has a significant Russian population. It is noteworthy that it was in Tashkent that the great Russian-chauvinist Turkestan Soviet Republic was formed, and it was from Tashkent that the last Russian troops were withdrawn. \n\nIn addition to the large cities, however, Russian settlers also made up a significant peasant population. It was they who formed the backbone of the Monstrov Peasant Army 20 years ago, and now they continue to live peacefully under the warm Turkestan sun.\n\nHowever, it's not all that simple. Recently, incidents of harassment of the Muslim population by the Russian-speaking population have become more frequent. According to the minister-chairman, all these clashes between non-Muslims and Muslims are initiated by Shuro-Ulema in order to unleash ethnic conflicts.

### Ideas ###
TRK_lasting_political_crisis: "Divided Governance"
TRK_lasting_political_crisis_desc: "For nearly two decades now, the Turkestan is ruled separately by two governments: the Federal Government, a coalition between the Jadidists and Qadimists in a weak balance under the leadership of Mustafa Shokay, and the Provisional Fergana Government, under the leadership of Madamin Bey. While the Madamin Bey's government has no real authority over the majority of Turkestan's territory, he's supported by some more radical groups, such as Korshirmat's Mujahideen and Monstrov's Peasant Army. The outcome of this confrontation will shape Turkestan's future."
TRK_illusion_of_democracy: "Incipient Democracy"
TRK_illusion_of_democracy_desc: "The notion of Turkestan as a democratic republic is a mere facade. While elections are conducted, parties exist nominally, and organizations operate without stringent regulations, the true power lies firmly with Minister-President Shokay and a faltering Jadidist-Qadimist coalition."
TRK_paramilitary_activities: "Unbridled Paramilitaries"
TRK_paramilitary_activities_desc: "Turkestan's turbulent political landscape is further complicated by active paramilitary groups — ERK's Turkestan Legion, a socialist Pan-Turkist militia and the Mujahideen of Korshirmat, entrenched in the East Pamir mountains. With the Turkestan National Guard's limited control, these radical movements pose a significant threat, capable of seizing power or exacerbating chaos."
TRK_army_of_mishrabs: "Vigilance of Mirshabs"
TRK_army_of_mishrabs_desc: "The Mirshabs, local militia and police units, emerge as the de facto armed forces of Turkestan due to the internal factionalism. Under the leadership of Ergash Bey, they profess allegiance to both the people and the state, as long as the state upholds the tenets of the Muslim faith."

The armed troops of the workers of Railroad Workshops played a defining role in establishing Soviet power in Tashkent in October 1917, but were suppressed during the Osipov Mutiny in January 1919. After the war, the factory was transfered to Russia, and since then was used by Russia in order to control the railways of Turkestan. Since 1934, a steel foundry was established. The plant is still an epicentre of both the Russian influence and socialist sentiments."

Yakub Khaimovich was a foreman of the Kokand Exchange Committee and a member of the accounting committee of the Russo-Chinese Bank in Kokand. The brothers were engaged in charity and were honorary members of various educational societies in the Fergana Valley. Before the revolution, in 1916, the Vadhyaevs bought the Ivanovo-Voznesenskaya manufactory and thus formed a huge textile combine, where the process began with a cotton field and ended with finished products.§!"

#Why did the "ERK" party openly adopt a socialist program? The main reason for the alienation of the native working class from national organizations and rapprochement with local and Russian workers and organizations was that such figures as Mustafa Shokay in 1917 in Kokand in a sharp form opposed socialism. Jadidists did not want to get closer to workers' unions and opposed the idea that apartments for middle-income workers and employees should be built by the state. It was at that time that the idea of forming the Tüde workers' party emerged, which was aimed at separating the Muslim workers from the Russian socialist parties and trade unions. ERK envisioned socialism as a democratic federation uniting national-state formations on the scale of Russia, which emerged on the basis of taking into account the uniqueness of each nation. ERK was against dictatorial tyranny. And the Russian Communist Party on the scale of all Russia pursued a policy of imperialist socialism. At that time, the Central Committee of the RCP allowed the establishment of a "Muslim Center" in Moscow, intended to help the Bolsheviks in their propaganda among Muslims, but did not allow the establishment of branches of this center locally. In 1920 ERK drew up the program of the party, adapting it to the conditions of Russia, and after emigration ERK did not find it necessary to change it. ERK party will be able to gain authority among the people if it stays true to the national idea and Islam. Only the party has to learn to operate in the conditions of democratic freedoms. In many cases we use the word "Muslim" or "Turkestan" instead of the word "Turk" to save the feelings of Tajiks. That is, racism is alien to us. If socialist theory, taking democracy and evolutionary development as its basis, can be combined with the national idea and Islamic values, it will be able to influence the broad masses in Turkestan. ERK  is a party peculiar only to Turkestan. Its program and ideas are not suitable for dissemination and use in other countries. The deprivation of the right of the peoples to be masters of their own wealth will lead to the establishment of unlimited domination over the individual. The essence is this: ERK must not be deceived by the imperialist, dictatorial socialism of the great powers and will strive for a socialism that does not restrict the rights of nations and the free will of individuals, but protects the autonomy of peoples and remains faithful to democratic norms.

turkestan_railway_crisis.1.t: "Main Railroad Worshops Hit By Strikes"
turkestan_railway_crisis.1.d: "In the wake of economic turmoil and political unrest throughout Russia, the Central Asian Railway has been thrown into disarray. The Main Railroad Workshops in Tashkent, a crucial hub for the railway, is now paralyzed due to worker strikes. These strikes were incited by various groups, including the ERK party and russophone socialist organizations. The situation has become critical, as the Russian Garrison stationed in New Tashkent finds itself isolated from Petrograd due to the disruption of communication lines. The Garrison has urgently requested our assistance in quelling the strikes to restore order and ensure the railway's functionality.\n\nHowever, within our government, there are differing opinions on how to approach this crisis. Our Ittifoqi Muslimin coalition allies, as well as oppositional ERK party members are calling for a bold move to disarm the Russian Garrison and regain control of New Tashkent, asserting our independence and authority. Such a move could have significant consequences for our relations with the Russian government. On the other hand, Madamin-Bek has proposed a cooperative effort to disarm the Garrison, which he believes could help strengthen our sovereignity. But this proposition is seen by Shokai as too radical, potentially bolstering Madamin-Bek's rival government even further."
turkestan_railway_crisis.1.a: "Assist the Russian Garrison."
turkestan_railway_crisis.1.b: "The Russians are no longer to command."

turkestan_railway_crisis.2.t: "Suppression of Strikes"
turkestan_railway_crisis.2.d: "Turkestan had long been a land of diverse cultures and voices, but in the midst of a severe crisis, those differences had taken on a more ominous tone. The worker strikes in Tashkent had ground the city's industrial heart to a halt, and their demands reverberated through the streets, echoing a call for greater autonomy and power. With the Russian Garrison in New Tashkent cut off from their Petrograd overlords, the situation became dire. The Russian Garrison turned to us, seeking assistance to suppress the strikes and regain control of the city. It was a fateful moment for our government led by Mustafa Shokai, as we had to decide where our loyalty truly lay. The orders were given, and the Turkestan National Guard, known for its loyalty to the government, was dispatched to Tashkent. Clad in their distinctive uniforms and bearing the emblem of Turkestan's flag, they entered the city with stern determination. As they arrived at the Main Railroad Workshop, the heart of the strike, they found a sea of workers, faces hardened by the trials of life, standing united. The atmosphere was tense, the air thick with anticipation. Mustafa Shokai's government had chosen to prioritize its relationship with Russia, and the consequences of this decision were about to play out. The Turkestan National Guard, armed and ready, moved in to disperse the crowds. It was a scene of turmoil, as shouts and cries filled the air. The workers resisted, chanting slogans of Turkestan's independence and socialist revolution. But the Guard's orders were clear, and they used force to suppress the strikes. In the end, the strikes were forcibly quelled. The Main Railroad Workshop, once a symbol of workers' power, fell back into the hands of the authorities. The Russian Garrison, accompanied by our forces, resumed control of New Tashkent.\n\nThe immediate outcome was the restoration of order, a sigh of relief from those who had longed for stability. Russia commended our cooperation, and the Russian Garrison's influence grew stronger in Turkestan. But within our nation, a growing sense of resentment began to take root. Nationalists and the ERK party saw us as compromising our autonomy for the sake of foreign interests. As the dust settled and the workers' voices faded, Turkestan found itself at a crossroads - with the potential consequences leading to our failure, or rise."
turkestan_railway_crisis.2.a: "At least, we have stabilized the situation."

turkestan_railway_crisis.3.t: "Coalition Shattered"
turkestan_railway_crisis.3.d: "The fragile coalition that held Turkestan together, forged in the fires of necessity, was now unraveling at its seams. The decision made by Mustafa Shokai's government had struck at the very core of the partnership. As the Turkestan National Guard suppressed the worker strikes in Tashkent, the cracks that had long existed between the Jadidists and the Qadhimists, representing the Turkiston Milliy Ittihod (Turkestan National Union) and Ittifoqi Muslimin (Union of Muslims) respectively, grew into unbridgeable chasms. The announcement came like a thunderclap in the political landscape of Turkestan. The Qadhimists, the more traditional and fundamentalist faction of the coalition, had decided to break away. They declared their support for Madamin-Bek's rival government, seeing in him a leader who could better represent their vision for Turkestan. The halls of power in Turkestan were filled with the clamor of discontented voices. Qadhimist leaders, once part of the coalition, now distanced themselves from the very government they had helped form. The divisions ran deep, and Turkestan's political stability was hanging by a thread.\n\nFor Mustafa Shokai, the decision had been a calculated gamble to maintain the balance between Russian interests and internal autonomy. However, the fallout was more significant than anyone could have predicted. With the Qadhimists now openly supporting the rival government, the Turkestan National Union was left weakened, its grip on power slipping. As the days unfolded, the government found itself facing a stark choice. As the situation slowly descends into chaos, there are voices that Shokai might abandon democratic institutions and dissolve the coalition altogether in the name of stability and control."
turkestan_railway_crisis.3.a: "The choice is yet to be made."

turkestan_railway_crisis.4.t: "ERK Calls for Turkestan-Wide Riots"
turkestan_railway_crisis.4.d: "The discontent in Turkestan had reached a boiling point. The ERK party, with its radical vision for a Turkestan united under socialist principles, had been agitating in the shadows for too long. Now, they saw an opportunity to seize the moment and launch a revolution that would reshape the region.\n\nFrom Tashkent to Kokand, from Samarkand to Pishpek, the call echoed through the cities and countryside. ERK had declared an all-Turkestan strike, urging workers of all backgrounds and ethnicities to unite against the perceived oppression of Mustafa Shokai's government. They promised equality, workers' rights, and an end to the perceived influence of Russian settlers.\n\nThe Dehkan peasants, long burdened by economic hardships and land inequality, answered this call with fervor. Riots erupted in towns and villages, as they demanded land reform and an end to their suffering. The Turkestan Republic was engulfed in a wave of protest and agitation.\n\nAs the news of the strikes and riots spread, Shokai's government found itself facing a grave challenge. ERK had managed to unite various factions under its banner, creating a broad-based coalition of discontent. The fragile stability that had been painstakingly built was now crumbling, and the fate of Turkestan hung in the balance."
turkestan_railway_crisis.4.a: "The ERK was always a threat to our rule."

turkestan_railway_crisis.5.t: "East Pamir Revolt"
turkestan_railway_crisis.5.d: "The rugged mountains of East Pamir have long been a bastion of Islamic faith, and it's in this remote and challenging terrain that a new and formidable challenge to Turkestan's stability has emerged. Korşirmat, the charismatic leader of the East Pamir Mujahideen, has declared the establishment of a rival government.\n\nIn a fiery proclamation, Korşirmat called for the creation of a pan-Islamist Turkestan, united under the banner of Sharia and Quran. He condemned what he saw as the weak and secular governance of Mustafa Shokai's administration and labeled it as an affront to true Islamic principles.\n\nThe Mujahideen had gained considerable support from local communities, and their declaration sent shockwaves throughout the region. They promised to restore the might of the Mujahideen, protect Islamic values, and free Turkestan from foreign influences. Their ranks swelled with passionate recruits, and they began to assert control over East Pamir.\n\nFor Mustafa Shokai's government, this posed a serious threat. Korşirmat's movement was not only religious but also deeply nationalistic. It tapped into the shared identity of many Turkestanis, who yearned for independence and a return to their Islamic roots."
turkestan_railway_crisis.5.a: "Another hotbed of resistance!"

turkestan_railway_crisis.6.t: "Turkestan Descends into Civil War"
turkestan_railway_crisis.6.d: "Turkestan, once a land of relative stability, has now plunged into the abyss of civil strife. The fragile peace that held the region together has shattered, with multiple factions vying for control.\n\nIn the heart of Turkestan, the city of Tashkent has fallen into the hands of the ERK party. Their calls for revolution have been answered, and they now wield considerable influence in the capital. To the east, Madamin-Bek has made his move. His forces are converging on Kokand, determined to seize power and establish his vision of Turkestan's future. Kokand, once a bastion of resistance against him, is now the focal point of a bitter struggle. Meanwhile, in the city of Osh, Korşirmat and his Mujahideen have taken control. With their pan-Islamist agenda, they are determined to establish a new order, governed by their interpretation of Sharia law. The loyalist forces, aligned with Mustafa Shokai's government, are fortifying their positions in Kokand. They believe it is there they must make their stand, for the future of Turkestan hangs in the balance."
turkestan_railway_crisis.6.a: "Federal Government shall stay!"
turkestan_railway_crisis.6.b: "For the workers and dehkans of Turkestan!"
turkestan_railway_crisis.6.c: "The Ferghana Government will become the only"
turkestan_railway_crisis.6.e: "Down with secularists! Korşirmat will lead us!"

turkestan_railway_crisis.7.t: "Russian Garrison Refused to Disarm!"
turkestan_railway_crisis.7.d: "Despite the calls of Madamin-Bek and his loyalists for a voluntary disarmament of the Russian Garrison, they refused to do so. The Madamin-Bek's forces have recently arrived in Tashkent, where the strikes paralyzed the life of city more and more and the tensions have drastically increased. As the Garrison's refusal was loudly heard across the region, the strikers call for decisive action against the Garrison and the Russians. With our government only tacitly watching the conflict, hopefully there won't be any serious clashes in the city borders."
turkestan_railway_crisis.7.a: "It seems that something bad is going to happen."

turkestan_railway_crisis.8.t: "Major Incident in Tashkent"
turkestan_railway_crisis.8.d: "Tensions in New Tashkent had reached a boiling point. The Russian Garrison, steadfast in their refusal to disarm, had become increasingly confrontational with our government. Meanwhile, the presence of Madamin-Bek's loyal troops, stationed nearby, cast an ominous shadow over the city.\n\nIt was a sweltering afternoon when the incident unfolded. A routine patrol by Russian soldiers, meant to showcase their strength and assert dominance, took an unexpected turn. As they passed through a crowded market square, a verbal altercation erupted between the Russian patrol and local vendors. Harsh words turned into shoving, and before long, fists were flying. The bustling marketplace transformed into a chaotic battleground. Nearby residents, many of them sympathizers of either Madamin-Bek's cause or the strikers, rushed to the scene to confront the Russian soldiers. The situation quickly escalated from brawls to armed clashes. Shots rang out, and chaos engulfed the streets of Tashkent. It was a fierce and bloody confrontation, with neither side willing to back down. The clashes lasted for hours, leaving casualties on both sides and sowing fear and panic among the civilian population. Madamin-Bek's loyal troops, who had been stationed just outside the city, received frantic reports of the violence erupting in Tashkent. Determined to protect their leader's interests, they swiftly moved in to quell the unrest. The arrival of reinforcements further intensified the fighting.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, the sounds of gunfire gradually faded, replaced by the wails of the wounded and the anguished cries of those who had lost loved ones. Tashkent had become a city scarred by violence and hatred, torn between loyalty to Russia and allegiance to Turkestan"
turkestan_railway_crisis.8.a: "Catastrophic!"

turkestan_railway_crisis.9.t: "Shokai's Dilemma"
turkestan_railway_crisis.9.d: "The violent clashes in Tashkent did not go unnoticed by the Russian government. Reports of the confrontation between the Russian Garrison and Madamin-Bek's loyal troops reached the highest echelons of power in Petrograd. The response from Russia was swift and unambiguous.\n\nRussian diplomats, acting on behalf of the Russian Government, delivered a stern message to Mustafa Shokai's administration. The message carried both condemnation and a clear threat. Russia, already grappling with internal turmoil, saw the incidents in Turkestan as a challenge to their authority in the region. They demanded immediate action to disarm Madamin-Bek's forces and restore order, warning that failure to comply would have dire consequences.\n\nIn response, Shokai's government found itself at a crossroads. On one hand, they could choose to pursue a diplomatic solution by cooperating with the Russian Garrison and taking measures to rein in Madamin-Bek's activities. This option might appease Russia and potentially mitigate further conflict. However, it could also be seen as compromising Turkestan's sovereignty and could lead to unrest among those who supported the cause of independence. On the other hand, Shokai's government could opt for a stance of neutrality, seeking to stay out of the conflict and leave Garrison's fate to Madamin-Bek's troops. Finally, this can be a perfect chance to independently crush Madamin-Bek's forces, supporting the Garrison - but using the chance to crush the Russian colonialists as well. The decision rested heavily on Shokai's shoulders, as he grappled with the complex web of alliances and rivalries that defined the political landscape of Turkestan. The future of the nation hung in the balance, and the consequences of this choice would shape the destiny of Turkestan for years to come."
turkestan_railway_crisis.9.d2: "The violent clashes in Tashkent went unnoticed by the Russian government. Reports of the confrontation between the Russian Garrison and Madamin-Bek's loyal troops reached the highest echelons of power in Petrograd. However, there was no response from Russia...\n\nLeaving the Garrison to its fate, the Russians are likely to lose all of their control over Turkestan now. On the other hand, Shokai's government could now opt for a stance of neutrality, seeking to stay out of the conflict and leave Garrison's fate to Madamin-Bek's troops.

turkestan_railway_crisis.10.t: "Tashkent Accords"
turkestan_railway_crisis.10.d: "In the wake of the Russian government's stern warnings and the escalating tensions within Turkestan, Mustafa Shokai faced an agonizing decision. Faced with the choice of either aligning with Russia or preserving Turkestan's independence, he ultimately opted for a diplomatic solution.\n\nShokai dispatched a team of envoys to negotiate with Russian representatives, proposing a fragile alliance that could serve the interests of both parties. His proposal outlined the following terms:\nTurkestan-Russian Accord: Shokai offered to form a Turkestan-Russian Accord, which would see both the Russian Garrison and Turkestan's National Guard coordinating their efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region. In the event of an open conflict involving other factions within Turkestan, the Russian government would pledge military support to Shokai's government.\nNeutrality in Disarmament: In exchange for Russian support, Shokai committed to remain neutral in the ongoing disarmament of the Russian Garrison in New Tashkent. He would not interfere with Madamin-Bek's efforts to disarm the Garrison and would allow the process to proceed unimpeded.\nMaintaining Autonomy: Shokai reaffirmed his commitment to maintaining Turkestan's allegiance within the Russian sphere of influence. While the alliance with Russia was a strategic move, he insisted that Turkestan would retain an independent state.\n\nThe Russian response to Shokai's proposal was awaited with bated breath. The fate of Turkestan hung in the balance, and the delicate dance of diplomacy had the potential to avert open conflict or plunge the region into further chaos."

turkestan_railway_crisis.11.b: "Sign the deal."

turkestan_railway_crisis.12.t: "Diplomatic Failure"
turkestan_railway_crisis.12.d: "Mustafa Shokai's gamble to seek a diplomatic solution with the Russian Garrison had ended in a chilling failure. Instead of accepting the terms, the Russian authorities, furious at the turn of events, demanded immediate military intervention to resolve the conflict. Tensions escalated rapidly, and the situation spiraled into a catastrophic crisis, more severe than anyone could have imagined. The Russian Garrison, far from being disarmed or coaxed into cooperation, faced a grim fate. They were not only disarmed but subjected to a brutal and relentless assault.\n\nThe international community was aghast at the horrifying events unfolding in Turkestan. Reports of the massacre of the Russian Garrison reached the highest diplomatic echelons, sparking outrage and condemnation from foreign governments. The incident had brought Turkestan to the brink of a full-scale war with Russia, a situation the nation could ill afford amidst its internal strife. Yet, the situation remained precarious, as Madamin-Bek had seized control of the entire Central Asian Railway, a strategic asset that could tip the scales of power in his favor. As the crisis deepened and the world watched, Turkestan now stood on the precipice of an uncertain and perilous future."
turkestan_railway_crisis.12.a: "It was dire to count on Russia."

turkestan_railway_crisis.13.t: "A Fragile Peace"
turkestan_railway_crisis.13.d: "In a stunning turn of events, Russia agreed to the terms laid out by Mustafa Shokai and signed the historic Tashkent Accords. The agreement, celebrated by some as a path to peace and stability, would have profound implications for Turkestan's future.\n\nUnder the terms of the accords, the Turkestan National Guard maintained its neutrality but offered discreet support to the Russian Garrison. This clandestine alliance, conducted behind the scenes, dealt a severe blow to Madamin-Bek's forces. As Madamin-Bek found himself losing ground, his once-loyal followers began to question his leadership. Faced with mounting pressure, Madamin-Bek was ultimately forced to abandon Tashkent. His flight from the city marked a significant decline in his popularity and influence, leaving a void that Shokai's government was quick to fill. As part of the treaty, the Russian Garrison, citing solidarity with the \"legitimate government of Turkestan\", laid down their weapons and prepared to withdraw from Turkestan. The New Tashkent, which had been a focal point of turmoil, was now freed from the Garrison's control, opening the way for Shokai's forces to take the city.\n\nWhile the populace celebrated this apparent display of Shokai's strength, the situation was far more complex. The Russian government's influence and pressure on Turkestan had grown significantly as a result of the accords. Mustafa Shokai found himself in a precarious position, navigating a delicate balance of power as Turkestan's internal and external dynamics continued to evolve."
turkestan_railway_crisis.13.a: "At least we have secured our positions."

turkestan_railway_crisis.14.t: "The Unfolding Railway War"
turkestan_railway_crisis.14.d: "As Mustafa Shokai hesitated to intervene in the escalating crisis, the situation in Turkestan took an ominous turn. The absence of government action emboldened Madamin-Bek and, unchecked, he launched a full-scale operation to assert his dominance over New Tashkent. Under the cover of darkness, Madamin-Bek's forces, bolstered by his newfound alliance with the Turkestan Military Organisation, swiftly seized control of Tashkent. The strikes that had paralyzed the Central Asian Railway were brutally crushed, with many striking workers and ERK supporters arrested, injured, or forced into hiding. ERK's leadership declared that they would continue their fight from the shadows.\n\nEven more concerning was the fate of the Russian Garrison. Isolated and disarmed, they found themselves at the mercy of Madamin-Bek's forces. A tense standoff ensued, with Madamin-Bek's troops holding the garrison hostage, effectively preventing them from reestablishing control.\n\nAs word of the \"Railway War\" spread, Shokai's government found itself in a dire predicament. The Russian government issued stern warnings, demanding immediate action to resolve the crisis and secure the safety of the Russian Garrison. Shokai faced a stark choice: cooperating with the Russian government and seeking a joint effort to suppress Madamin-Bek's forces and regain control over New Tashkent. This option, however, risked further alienating Turkestan's populace and could lead to a loss of sovereignity.\n\nAlternatively, Shokai can decide to leave the fate of the Russian Garrison in Madamin-Bek's hands. This would avoid direct confrontation with Russia but risked strengthening Madamin-Bek's position as a dominant force in Turkestan.\n\nThe clock was ticking, and Shokai's choice would have profound consequences for the future of Turkestan."

turkestan_railway_crisis.15.t: "End of Ferghana Government?"
turkestan_railway_crisis.15.d: "Mustafa Shokai's deliberations had come to an end. Seeing the unfolding crisis as an opportune moment to eliminate the threat posed by Madamin-Bek's Provisional Ferghana Government, Shokai had crafted a daring plan.\n\nIn a meticulously coordinated operation, Shokai's forces moved swiftly. Troops were dispatched both to the Ferghana Valley and Tashkent, determined to crush the rival government and assert Shokai's authority. In Ferghana, Madamin-Bek's government structures proved fragile and ill-prepared for such a rapid onslaught. Within days, they crumbled, allowing Shokai's forces to assert control over the region.\n\nThe battle for Tashkent, however, was more formidable. Madamin-Bek's forces had entrenched themselves in the city, and a tense standoff ensued. Shokai's government, with the backing of the Turkestan National Guard, coordinated a multi-pronged assault alongside the Russian Garrison, catching Madamin-Bek's forces off guard. After days of intense fighting, Madamin-Bek's forces were overwhelmed. Madamin-Bek himself was arrested and taken into custody. The Turkestan National Guard, led by loyalists to Shokai, swiftly secured the entire city.\n\nBut Shokai had one more surprise in store. With Tashkent now firmly in his grasp, he ordered the Turkestan National Guard to disarm the Russian Garrison, catching them off guard. This move took the Russian Garrison by surprise, leaving them powerless and allowing Shokai's forces to completely subdue the city. With Madamin-Bek's government dismantled and the Russian Garrison disarmed, Shokai had achieved a decisive victory. His rule now extended over much of the territory, and the immediate threat posed by his rivals had been eliminated. At least for now..."

turkestan_railway_crisis.16.d: "Mustafa Shokai's decision to jointly crush Madamin-Bek and liberate the Russian Garrison had far-reaching and disastrous consequences. The plan, while ambitious, would prove to be a catastrophic failure. Russia, grappling with its own challenges, could only offer Shokai formal international \"approval\" for his endeavor, leaving him effectively alone against Madamin-Bek's formidable forces in Tashkent. Shokai's gamble to strike at Madamin-Bek's so-called \"bandit forces\" with the Turkestan National Guard would end in tragedy.\n\nAs the two sides clashed in the streets of Tashkent, it became painfully clear that Shokai's forces were outmatched. They not only lost the street battle but witnessed a horrifying turn of events. Madamin-Bek, seeking to make a bold statement, executed a significant number of the Russian Garrison, leaving only their command as hostages. This ruthless act sent shockwaves through the region. With no other option, the Turkestan National Guard was forced to retreat, leaving Tashkent in the hands of Madamin-Bek's forces. The situation in Turkestan had grown dire, with Madamin-Bek now calling for an open revolt against what he labeled the \"traitors of Turkestan\".\n\nNews of the government's failures and Madamin-Bek's rise to power quickly spread, sparking uprisings and protests in cities across Turkestan. The population, disillusioned with Shokai's leadership, began to rally behind the charismatic figure of Madamin-Bek. Adding to the crisis, the Russians, upon hearing the latest developments, decided to seize all support for Shokai's government, leaving them to their own devices. Turkestan now stood on the brink of a full-scale civil war, its future more uncertain than ever."

turkestan_railway_crisis.17.d: "As the Railway War unfolded, Mustafa Shokai was faced with a grim choice. While the situation was dire, he refused to intervene militarily, opting for a path of prudence and seeking to prevent further bloodshed. Madamin-Bek's forces had effectively executed much of the Russian Garrison command, sparing only the general staff as hostages. In response, Madamin-Bek declared Shokai's government illegitimate, labeling it \"dead\", and called for open revolt against what he dubbed the \"traitors of Turkestan\".\n\nHowever, his brutal actions were not met with universal support. Many Turkestanis recognized that Shokai had tried to avoid being drawn into the conflict, aiming to prevent unnecessary violence. They believed that Madamin-Bek's decision to execute the Garrison was his own choice, and nobody had forced his hand.\n\nIn this critical moment, the ERK, having suffered from Madamin-Bek's actions as well, declared their loyalty to the Republic and the duly elected government. They denounced Madamin-Bek's radicalism and affirmed their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. The same position was shared by the Ittifoqi Muslimin, who believed that democracy would still be a much more stable solution, than a civil war.\n\nThe population, torn between two opposing factions, began to reconsider their allegiances. Shokai's government, although weakened, retained a semblance of legitimacy in the eyes of many Turkestanis who desired a peaceful and stable future for their homeland."

Nestled within the rugged terrain of Tian-Shan, Pishpek had long been a region marked by its distinct cultural and ethnic character. The local Kyrgyz population, led by Abdykerim Sydykov and supported by a branch of the Alash party, saw the tumultuous times as an opportunity to assert their autonomy. As the Turkestan Republic grappled with internal strife and external threats, Pishpek declared its independence, breaking away from the central government. Their decision was heavily influenced by Alash Orda, the neighboring state, which had offered its guarantees of support. Despite the protests from Shokai's government, which asserted that this was an internal matter, Pishpek's declaration of independence stood. The newly formed state would now determine its own destiny, charting a course in the turbulent seas of the Turkestani Civil War.

Suggested by some of the seasoned officers, a series of false attacks should be orchestrated, drawing Madamin-Bek's forces away from critical positions. Meanwhile, a select group of our National Guard's fighting strength would attempt a covert infiltration, targeting key strategic points from within. Against the advice, Shokai envisioned a swift and overwhelming assault, that would infiltrate Ferghana under the cover of night. The main army, simultaneously launching a frontal assault, will aim for a swift victory before Madamin-Bek could muster a coherent defense."

The narrow streets bore witness to the clash of forces, the echoes of battle still resonating in the predawn silence. Madamin-Bek, betrayed by some of his loyalists and caught in the web of Shokai's strategic cunning, was apprehended. The Ferghana government crumbled, and the city became a symbol of Shokai's triumph. However, as the dust settled over Ferghana, a new challenge loomed on the horizon. The precarious situation in Samarqand demanded swift action. With ERK and Mujahideen eyeing the city, Shokai faced a dilemma.\n\nOn the one hand, Shokai can prioritize the defense of Samarqand, fortifying its walls and gathering forces to repel any would-be conquerors. This would undoubtedly lead to a fierce battle, as both ERK and Mujahideen sought to claim the city for their cause. The outcome of such a battle however, is uncertain. On the other hand, acknowledging the vulnerability of Ferghana Valley, Shokai can consolidate his recent conquest. The wise choice would be the reinforcement of Ferghana's defenses, anticipating a potential counterattack by the Mujahideen forces in the region. Simultaneously, Kokand's defenses can be strengthened to secure the heartland of Turkestan against other threats."

turkestan_civil_war.36.t: "The Second Battle of Kokand"
turkestan_civil_war.36.d: "In the shadow of the Ferghana Mountains, the city of Kokand became the battleground for a pivotal clash that would determine the fate of Turkestan. Madamin-Bek, having survived the initial confrontation with Shokai's forces, now faced a new adversary — Korşirmat and the Mujahideen. The streets of Kokand, scarred by the recent conflict, bore witness to the ebb and flow of power. Korşirmat, seizing the opportunity, launched a decisive assault against Madamin-Bek's weakened forces. The echoes of war resonated through the city, each blast a testament to the struggle for dominance. Despite Madamin-Bek's initial success in rallying the defenders, the Mujahideen's relentless onslaught proved too much. The battle unfolded in a chaotic dance of swords and gunfire, with the fate of Kokand hanging in the balance. Madamin-Bek's forces, already fatigued and depleted, crumbled under the fierce assault. As the dust settled over the war-torn city, it became evident that Madamin-Bek's ambitions had met their match. The Mujahideen, emerging victorious, solidified their control over Kokand. The defeat marked a turning point in the conflict, sending shockwaves through the region. With the joint forces of Shokai and ERK consolidating their power in Tashkent, and Korşirmat proclaiming the Islamic Republic of Ferghana, a tense stalemate settled over the war-weary land. The intricate dance of alliances and rivalries had reached an impasse, leaving Turkestan in a precarious state of division. The once-united nation now found itself fractured, with each faction claiming its own vision for the future."
turkestan_civil_war.36.d.shokai: "In the heart of Ferghana Valley, the city of Kokand bore witness to a decisive clash that reverberated through the annals of Turkestani history. Madamin-Bek, undeterred by previous setbacks, found himself facing the joint might of ERK and Shokai's forces in a struggle for supremacy. The once vibrant streets of Kokand became a battleground, where ideologies clashed and destinies were shaped. Madamin-Bek, valiant but outnumbered, fought fiercely to defend his vision for Turkestan. The alliance between ERK and Shokai proved formidable, with coordinated strikes and strategic brilliance. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the battle reached its climax. Madamin-Bek's forces, facing overwhelming opposition, were pushed to the brink. The city echoed with the cacophony of gunfire and the thunderous roars of combat.\n\nUltimately, the joint forces of ERK and Shokai emerged victorious, securing their hold on Kokand. The defeat of Madamin-Bek marked the end of a tumultuous chapter in Turkestan's history. Yet, as the triumphant alliance proclaimed victory, a new challenge presented itself in the form of Korşirmat and the Mujahideen. In Ferghana, a tense stalemate settled over the region. The Mujahideen, undeterred by Madamin-Bek's defeat, stood ready to defend their vision of an Islamic Turkestan. The joint government of ERK and Shokai, while claiming victory, faced the delicate task of consolidating their power and maintaining stability in a nation scarred by conflict. The war, though declared over, left Turkestan standing at a crossroads, its future uncertain and contested."

turkestan_civil_war.37.d: "In the shadow of Tian-Shan, the city of Tashkent stood as the last stronghold of ERK and Shokai's fading alliance. The once bustling metropolis now faced the imminent threat of Madamin-Bek's forces, determined to erase the remnants of opposition and assert their dominance. As Madamin-Bek's army approached Tashkent, a sense of urgency enveloped the city. ERK militias and Shokai loyalists rallied to defend their ideological fortress. The narrow streets echoed with the footsteps of soldiers preparing for a battle that would shape the destiny of Turkestan. Madamin-Bek, fueled by the fervor of his supporters and guided by the strategic counsel of the TVO, orchestrated a multi-pronged assault on Tashkent. Simultaneously, an uprising orchestrated by the TVO within the city further destabilized the defenses. The once unassailable bastion now faced challenges from within and without. The battle for Tashkent unfolded in the labyrinthine streets, each alley a theater of conflict. Madamin-Bek's forces, driven by a desire to bring about a new era, fought with unwavering determination. As the conflict escalated, the resistance of ERK and Shokai crumbled. The city fell to the triumphant forces of Madamin-Bek, marking a symbolic end to the once powerful alliance.\n\nHowever, victory in Tashkent came at a cost. Exploiting the diversion created by Madamin-Bek's assault, the Mujahideen launched a relentless offensive in Ferghana Valley. The very heartland that had witnessed intense struggles between factions now faced a renewed onslaught. In Ferghana, the Mujahideen, under the leadership of Korşirmat, achieved a decisive victory, shattering Madamin-Bek's resistance. With Ferghana under their control, the Mujahideen declared their triumph, setting the stage for a tense stalemate in the war. Madamin-Bek, having eliminated ERK and Shokai from the scene, now faced the Mujahideen as the sole remaining rival. The war, though seemingly reaching its conclusion, left Turkestan standing on the precipice of an uncertain future. The once-divided land now awaited the next chapter in its tumultuous history."

turkestan_civil_war.38.t: "Imminent Collapse of Ferghana Government"
turkestan_civil_war.38.d: "The ancient city of Osh, nestled between the Pamir and Alai Range, became the arena for a cataclysmic clash that would reverberate across the fate of Turkestan. Madamin-Bek, driven by ambition and a desire to extend his influence, launched a bold assault on Osh, the stronghold of the Mujahideen. As Madamin-Bek's forces descended upon Osh, the rugged terrain and fortified positions of the Mujahideen proved formidable. The battle that ensued was marked by fierce resistance from Korşirmat's loyalists. Despite the initial enthusiasm, Madamin-Bek's assault proved disastrous. The mountainous landscape, coupled with the Mujahideen's strategic advantage, turned the tides against him. ERK and Shokai, sensing an opportune moment, seized the chance to reclaim lost territories. Shokai swiftly directed his forces towards Kokand, reclaiming the city with little resistance. Meanwhile, ERK, rejuvenated by the chaos in Osh, moved decisively to surround Madamin-Bek's weakened forces in Samarqand. As ERK closed in on Samarqand, local Jadidist resistance within the city saw an opportunity to overthrow Madamin-Bek's weakened rule. The streets of Samarqand, once again a battleground, witnessed a fierce uprising against the remnants of his government. Caught in a pincer movement between ERK and the resurgent Jadidist rebellion, Madamin-Bek's forces crumbled. The once-dominant leader found himself on the brink of defeat. In a desperate attempt to salvage his position, Madamin-Bek escaped the encirclement, leaving Samarqand to the tumult of internal strife.\n\nThe collapse of Madamin-Bek's government cast Turkestan into a state of uncertainty. Shokai and ERK, having reclaimed significant territories, now stood in a precarious balance with the advancing Mujahideen. Taking advantage of the power vacuum in Ferghana Valley, the Mujahideen moved in, conquering Madamin-Bek's former seat of government. With Madamin-Bek's escape and his government in shambles, Turkestan now faced a double-sided stalemate. Shokai and ERK, having solidified their positions, confronted the advancing Mujahideen, setting the stage for a complex and uncertain future. The land, once divided by rival factions, now faced the challenge of navigating through the aftermath of the catastrophic events in Osh."

turkestan.intro.t: "Turbulent 1917"
turkestan.intro.d: "In the wake of the February Revolution in Russia, the political landscape of Central Asia underwent significant upheaval, mirroring the events unfolding in the larger Russian empire. Turkestan found itself at a critical crossroad, torn between national liberal social organizations and predominantly Russian congresses of the Soviets. On November 28, 1917, the All-Turkestan Qurultai of Muslims was convened under the leadership of the liberal-democratic Shuro-i-Islamiya party. In a historic proclamation, Turkestan autonomy was declared as part of the Federal Russia.\n\nHowever, the young Turkestan autonomy faced immediate challenges, marked by a fierce confrontation between various political currents involved in its formation, most notably between the Jadids and Qadimists. As the influence of the Qadimists gained momentum, it led to the resignation of the first premier, Tynyshpayev, followed by the overthrow of Shokai in February 1918. The clash between these ideological forces laid the foundation for an impending civil war that threatened the stability and future of the newly born republic."

turkestan.202.t: "The Fall of Bolshevik Power in Turkestan"
turkestan.202.d: "In the summer of 1918, the Turkestan Soviet Republic found itself cut off from Soviet Russia as the flames of the Civil War engulfed the region. Isolated and facing numerous challenges, the once-dominant Bolshevik methods proved ineffective in maintaining control over Turkestan. The failure of Soviet Russia to provide much-needed support left the region vulnerable, and those opposing the regime began to seize the opportunity to strengthen their forces.\n\nDuring the Askhabad Mutiny, a Trans-Caspian Provisional Government emerged, backed by the British mission, further weakening the grip of the Bolsheviks. This newfound opposition found allies in various quarters. In November 1918, the Fergana Peasant Army, led by Monstrov and comprising volunteer units of peasant settlers, rallied against the Bolsheviks in Jalalabad. In Tashkent, in January 1919, a rebellion orchestrated by the military commissar Osipov resulted in the loss of many lives of Soviet workers.\n\nAs the year progressed, opposition forces united against the Bolsheviks. The Peasant Army, Madamin Bey Mojahedin, and the Semirechye Army Cossacks joined hands, culminating in the formation of the Provisional Fergana Government. The relentless resistance led to the eventual overthrow of Bolshevik power in Turkestan. The Provisional Fergana Government, in a moment of historic significance, declared the restoration of the Turkestan Republic and the end of the oppressive dictatorships that once held sway over the region."

turkestan.203.t: "Turkestan Military Organisation"
turkestan.203.d: "In February 1918, the Turkestan Military Organization (TVO) emerged as a clandestine anti-Bolshevik group, founded by former officers of the Tsarist army, Russian intellectuals, and former officials. Nicknamed the White Guard of Turkestan, the TVO played a significant role in defeating the Bolsheviks during the Turkestan Civil War. The organization received active assistance from foreign intelligence agents, primarily the British, with figures like Wilfred Malleson and agents operating under the guise of foreign diplomatic missions accredited in Tashkent under the Soviet government.\n\nMembers of this underground organization established connections with Ataman Dutov, General Denikin, Alash Orda Kazakhs, the Emir of Bukhara, leaders of Fergana and Turkmen Mujahideen, Transcaspian White Guard forces, and English consuls in Kashgar, Kulja, and Meshed. Konstantin Osipov, a former Bolshevik who staged a rebellion against his own in January 1919, the peasant army of Konstantin Monstrov, and the Madamin-Bek's Mujahideen - all became mere pawns in the cunning game of the Turkestan Military Organization.\n\nThe leader of the organization, Pyotr Kornilov, brother of the Russian military commander Lavr Kornilov, though perished, leaving a power vacuum within the organization. In this void, Osipov and Monstrov, former ideological opponents, joined forces for a common goal, gaining the upper hand. Meanwhile, Madamin-Bek also played a crucial role in the organization, but it is clear that this triumvirate will not willingly share power if they manage to seize it - and they most certainly will try..."

turkestan.1.t: "Crisis in the Turkestan Federal Republic"
turkestan.1.d: "In 1920, the Turkestan Federal Republic emerged following agreements between Russia and the Provisional Fergana Government. The restoration of the Prime Minister's post saw Mustafa Shokai taking the helm, accompanied by the establishment of a parliamentary body known as the Khalq Majlisi and the formation of a new government. Despite these efforts, Russia's control over Turkestan proved untenable, leading to the eventual withdrawal of Russian troops from the region. In 1926, Kerensky recognized the independence of the Turkestan Republic, marking a critical turning point in the nation's history.\n\nUnder Mustafa Shokai's leadership as Minister-President, the Turkestan Federal Republic attempted to navigate the complexities of a country grappling with internal problems. Despite its liberal-leaning regime in comparison to its neighbor, the Emirate of Bukhara, the Turkestan Federal Republic faced mounting challenges that threatened its stability.\n\nFor the past 16 years, Shokai has struggled to hold together a nation on the verge of disintegration. A fragile coalition government between the Jadidists and Qadhimists has been fraught with internal dissent, and in the East Pamirs, a Mujahedeen uprising has erupted, adding to the nation's woes. On another front, the pan-Turkist socialist movement ERK is gaining popularity, further complicating the political landscape."

turkestan.204.t: "Rival Governments of Turkestan"
turkestan.204.d: "As Turkestan enters the new year, four prominent leaders emerged, each with a vision and a following that would define the course of history for the region. These leaders represent distinct ideologies and aspirations, and their interactions will set the stage for a tumultuous struggle for power.\n\nIn the heart of Turkestan, nestled in the ancient city of Kokand, Mustafa Shokai and his Federal Government stands as a symbol of balance and compromise. His government is a coalition, an intricate dance between the Jadidist social liberals and the Qadhimist social conservatives. It is a fragile union, born out of necessity amid the chaotic turmoil of the Turkestan Republic. Mustafa Shokai, a pragmatic and skilled diplomat, believs that only by bridging the divide between the Jadidists and the Qadhimists can Turkestan find stability. He envisions a republic that uphelds democratic values and respects the rights of its diverse population. Shokai's primary goal is to prevent the disintegration of Turkestan, striving for unity within diversity.\n\nIn the east, in the heart of the Ferghana Valley, Madamin-Bek holds sway. His vision is starkly different from Shokai's pragmatic coalition. Madamin-Bek, a pragmatic yet authoritarian leader, believs that Turkestan needs a firm hand to restore order and assert its independence. His government is characterized by its authoritarian rule and focus on national liberation. Madamin-Bek's primary goal is to consolidate power over the entire region, breaking free from external influences, and unifying Turkestan under a centralized authority. To him, this is the only way to bring stability and end the chaos that had gripped the land.\n\nIn the rugged terrain of East Pamir, Korşirmat and his Mujahideen hold their own vision of Turkestan's future. Theirs is a vision deeply rooted in Islamic principles and the call for Sharia law. They see themselves as the guardians of faith, dedicated to establishing an Islamic state that adhered strictly to the tenets of their religion. Korşirmat's goal is clear: to forge a pan-Islamic Turkestan where Islamic law and principles would reign supreme. He believs in the power of religion to unite the diverse peoples of the region under a common banner of faith.\n\nIn the bustling streets of Tashkent, Torokul Dzhanuzakov's ERK party stirs the passions of those who yearn for social and economic equality. Their ideology blended Panturkism with socialist principles, drawing inspiration from the Left SR program. ERK envisions a Turkestan united with other Turkic peoples, transcending ethnic and religious divisions. Dzhanuzakov's goal is to establish a socialist state that champions the cause of the working class. He aimed to forge a society that values equality and justice above all else, while also promoting solidarity among the Turkic peoples of the region."

turkestan.205.t: "The Turkestan Derby"
turkestan.205.d: "In the heart of Turkestan, where the echoes of political rivalry reverberated through every corner, there existed a different kind of contest — one that cut through the deep divide in the country. Football, often hailed as the \"beautiful game\", had taken on a deeper significance in the region.\n\nThis crisp, sun-kissed afternoon, the streets of Kokand and Ferghana buzzed with anticipation. The two cities are not just geographical neighbors; they are also rival capitals of opposing political ideologies. Kokand is the seat of power for Mustafa Shokai's government. Ferghana, on the other hand, is the stronghold of Madamin-Bek's Provisional Ferghana Government. As the Turkestan Derby loomed, tension hangs in the air. This isn't merely a football match; it is a microcosm of the larger struggle for Turkestan's soul. The Kokand team is a symbol of the coalition, while the Ferghana team embodies the uncompromising spirit of Madamin-Bek's government.\n\nFans painted in their team's colors flooded the streets, their cheers and chants echoing through the urban canyons. Families and friendships are divided along political lines, creating a palpable tension that only deepened the stakes. The referee's whistle has pierced the air, and the match begins. On the pitch, 22 athletes battle for supremacy, but the real contest unfolded in the hearts and minds of the spectators. Every pass, every tackle, every goal was imbued with meaning far beyond sport. It is a testament to the resilience of a people determined to find unity in diversity or uphold the uncompromising pursuit of a singular vision.\n\nAs the final whistle blows, one team emerges victorious, but the scoreline did little to sway the convictions of those who watched. In the wake of the Turkestan Derby, the divide remains as deep as ever, but for a brief moment, the power of sport had brought people together, if only to remind them of the complex tapestry of their shared identity in a land where football reflected more than just a game — it mirrored the struggle for Turkestan's future."

turkestan.206.t: "Tensions in East Pamir"
turkestan.206.d: "In the secluded region of East Pamir, nestled amidst the rugged mountains and pristine valleys, life carried on at its own pace. Isolated from the political machinations of the Turkestan Republic to the west, this remote part of the nation had always maintained an air of autonomy. East Pamir consisted of scattered settlements, the most prominent among them being the town of Murghab, a bastion of local governance. The people here were known for their self-reliance, with each community adhering to its own customs and traditions. Among them, Korşirmat, a charismatic and fiery leader, had emerged as a figure of influence. \n\nRecently, rumors had begun to circulate through the region like a gust of desert wind. Whispers spoke of the emergence of an enigmatic group — the Islamic Revolutionary Society. Some claimed it was a clandestine organization formed to champion the cause of pan-Islamism, while others insisted it was a manifestation of discontent with the Turkestan Republic's secular policies. As the winds of change rustled through the valleys of East Pamir, a sense of unease settled over the land. Korşirmat, the charismatic leader, was believed to be associated with this mysterious society. The Emirate of Bukhara, a neighboring power, watched these developments with interest, its own expansionist ambitions casting a shadow over the region. Though tensions in East Pamir remained localized for now, there were murmurs that this remote corner of Turkestan might become the spark that ignited a larger conflict, with the Islamic Revolutionary Society at the center of it all. The delicate balance in this isolated land seemed poised on the edge of transformation, and the ripples of change threatened to reach far beyond the rugged peaks of East Pamir."

turkestan.207.t: "The Birth of the National Guard"
turkestan.207.d: "In Turkestan, some may claim that power was always fragmented and regional allegiances held sway, and therefore the notion of a centralized and state-controlled armed force had long remained elusive. Local militias, often doubling as law enforcement, known as Mishrabs, maintained an uneasy peace throughout the land. These units, led by various figures of influence, including Katta Ergash, had historically pledged their loyalties to different factions within the republic, creating an intricate web of allegiances.\n\nKatta Ergash, himself a staunch advocate of Qadhimist principles, commanded a considerable following within the Mishrab units. His association with the Ittifoqi Muslimin further fueled doubts about the militias' loyalty to the Turkestan Republic as a whole.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, other armed groups had emerged. The Turkestan Legion, a paramilitary wing of the ERK party, operated with a vision of radical change and socialist transformation. Korşirmat's Mujahideen, embodying pan-Islamist ideals, stood as formidable contenders, particularly in the eastern reaches of the nation. Loyal forces rallied under the banner of Madamin-Bek, with the Ferghana Peasant Army of Russian settlers adding a unique dimension to the shifting power dynamics. Amidst this complex landscape, Mustafa Shokai, the leader of the Turkestan Republic, recognized the need for a force that could provide stability and loyalty to his government. In a bold move, he issued a decree of the establishment of the Turkestan National Guard — an armed force dedicated to defending the interests of the republic and ensuring its sovereignty.\n\nWith the birth of the National Guard, Shokai aims to forge a military entity that transcends regional affiliations. He seeks to create a cohesive and disciplined force that would operate in the service of the entire nation, rather than factional interests. The move not only marked a significant step toward military development within Turkestan but also signaled Shokai's determination to consolidate his rule and assert the authority of the central government. As the fledgling Turkestan National Guard take its first steps, it is remained to be seen how this new force would navigate the intricate web of rivalries and allegiances that had defined the Turkestan Republic thus far."

turkestan.208.t: "The Railroad and Tashkent Condominium"
turkestan.208.d: "The construction of railroads in Central Asia marked a pivotal moment in the history of Turkestan, forging powerful connections between Russia's inland regions and the vast landscapes of the Turkestan Republic. These iron arteries breathed life into the agrarian sector, spurred the textile industry, and facilitated the region's integration into the all-Russian market. The Central Asian railroad system became the lifeblood of trade and commerce, threading its way through the heart of the nation. However, the role of the Central Asian Railroad extended far beyond economic significance; it was a crucial player in the Turkestan Civil War. As the conflict raged on, control over these vital railway arteries became a matter of strategic importance. The railroad's control points often determined the flow of troops and supplies, rendering it a valuable asset in the midst of turmoil.\n\nFollowing the cessation of hostilities, a treaty was signed between Russia and the Turkestan Republic, officially recognizing the latter's independence. However, the city of Tashkent, a critical hub along the Central Asian Railroad, presented a unique challenge. To navigate this delicate issue, Tashkent was officially divided into two distinct districts. The majority-Muslim districts of Old Tashkent fell under the governance of the Turkestan Republic. Here, the traditions and culture of the local populace flourished, shaping the district's character. In contrast, New Tashkent, boasting a predominantly Russian population, was placed under the administration of the Russian Garrison stationed within its borders. Effectively, this district operated as an extension of the Russian government. Beyond the city limits of Tashkent, the broader Tashkent region became a diplomatic Condominium. In this territory, representatives from both the Turkestan Republic and the Russian Garrison cooperated, or at times clashed, in managing the region's affairs. It was a complex arrangement aimed at maintaining some semblance of stability amid the shifting sands of post-war Turkestan.\n\nYet, perhaps the most pivotal outcome was the control of the Central Asian Railroad. This intricate web of tracks and terminals came under the jurisdiction of the Russian Garrison based in Tashkent. This control allowed the Garrison to hold a tight grip on trade and logistics, effectively influencing the economic and political landscape of the entire region. It also offered the Turkestan Military Organisation a stronghold in New Tashkent, further complicating matters. For the various internal factions vying for influence in Turkestan, the control of the railways remained a potent symbol of true independence. Many believed that only when Turkestan reclaimed control over its vital transportation arteries could the dream of full autonomy become a reality. The struggle for dominance over the Central Asian Railroad would shape the destiny of the Turkestan Republic and determine the extent of its sovereignty in the years to come."

turkestan.209.d: "Turkestan had long stood as a vibrant economic crossroads, with our prosperity deeply intertwined with the Silk Road. Trade routes stretching across the vast expanse of Central Asia converged within our borders, and our merchants bartered goods with far-reaching lands. For years, this economic tapestry had woven together the fortunes of the Turkestan Republic with those of its neighbors. However, the stability of the Russian ruble, upon which Turkestan's economic health hinged, began to falter. An unsettling wave of uncertainty rippled through Russia's economic foundations, resulting in the devaluation of the ruble. With each fall in its value, the tremors of this economic upheaval reverberated through Turkestan's markets.\n\nThe once-steady value of the ruble was now eroding rapidly. Prices soared higher each day as merchants and traders struggled to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of imports. Goods that had once been readily available became luxuries few could afford. As economic uncertainty gripped the land, businesses shuttered their doors. Once bustling marketplaces now stood desolate, their owners unable to bear the weight of financial ruin. Moreover, mass unemployment plagued the republic as companies faced insurmountable losses. Turkestan's citizens, once gainfully employed, found themselves cast adrift in a sea of uncertainty. The ordinary rhythms of life were disrupted as families struggled to make ends meet. The cost of living skyrocketed, and long lines formed outside stores that still had wares to sell. The government is caught in a tumultuous storm, faced with a nation in economic turmoil."

turkestan.210.d: "The economic turmoil sweeping across Turkestan has cast a dark shadow over the republic, challenging our leaders to make difficult decisions. Mustafa Shokai's government now faces a crucial juncture, as they must choose a course of action to address the ongoing economic crisis. The choices before them carry distinct consequences.\n\nIn a bid to stabilize the economy, the government can implement stringent austerity measures. These measures include cutting public spending, reducing subsidies, and implementing higher taxes. While this approach may lead to short-term hardships for citizens, it is seen as a prudent way to restore fiscal responsibility and encourage foreign investment. However, it may also spark protests and civil unrest due to the harsh economic conditions imposed on the population. Alternatively, the government can choose to provide direct economic relief to its citizens, focusing on safeguarding their well-being during these turbulent times. By offering subsidies, food aid, and temporary financial assistance, they aim to alleviate the immediate suffering of the population. While this approach may gain support from the people and quell social unrest, it could strain the government's resources and lead to long-term economic challenges. The government can opt for a more ambitious approach by encouraging self-reliance and diversification of trade. By investing in local industries, promoting agricultural self-sufficiency, and seeking alternative trade partners beyond Russia and [KHI.GetName], Turkestan can work towards long-term economic resilience. This choice may take time to yield results, but it aims to reduce the republic's dependence on the Russian economy."

turkestan.211.d: "In the heart of Turkestan, the ancient cities of Tashkent and Samarqand, found themselves at the center of a different kind of history — the history of protest, dissent, and social unrest. The economic downturn and austerity measures imposed by the government had pushed the citizens to their limits, and the streets bore witness to their collective frustration. The bustling streets of Tashkent, the capital of Turkestan, had transformed into a tableau of dissent. A diverse sea of citizens, representing all walks of life, converged in the city center. It was a vibrant mosaic of voices—students, laborers, merchants, intellectuals, and families—all united by a common message: they had endured enough. The air was electric with fervor, and a chorus of chants filled the streets. Placards bearing messages of defiance reached toward the sky, their messages echoing the collective anger that had ignited this unprecedented protest. \"Bread and jobs, not austerity!\" they cried, and their voices reverberated against the concrete jungle.\n\nIn Samarqand, the city known for its magnificent architecture and historical significance, the unrest was equally palpable. The iconic Registan Square, typically a hub of tourism and cultural appreciation, had become the stage for dissent. Beneath the majestic arches of the ancient madrasas, the protesters gathered. The Registan, bathed in the golden glow of the setting sun, was now the backdrop for a different kind of history. Placards bearing messages of defiance were held high against the backdrop of centuries-old architecture, a powerful symbol of the intersection between tradition and modernity.\n\nTurkestan was at a crossroads, and the government faced a difficult choice — where to deploy its forces to suppress the unrest, in Tashkent or Samarqand, as the resources of the yet small National Guard are limited. The decision would carry profound consequences for the nation's future."

It was a precarious situation that left Mustafa Shokai with a grave decision to make —should he suppress the unrest in Tashkent or in Samarqand?
turkestan.212.d: "$turkestan.212.d.intro$\n\nPresident Shokai weighed the implications carefully. Tashkent was a complex web of influences; it housed the Russian Garrison, a simmering hub of Russophile sentiment, making it a potential powder keg. The ERK party had a strong presence here, and whispers suggested that the Turkestan Military Organisation had covert operations in the city as well. Suppressing dissent in Tashkent could potentially quell these hotbeds of opposition. The government's decision was clear: they would focus their efforts on suppressing the turmoil in Tashkent. Mishrabs and National Guard units were mobilized with precision. The streets of the capital bore witness to clashes between the authorities and those demanding change. Days turned into nights, and nights into days, as the government maintained its grip on Tashkent. The once-vibrant city had been transformed into a battleground, its citizens divided and its spirit scarred."
turkestan.212.d2: "$turkestan.212.d.intro$\n\nPresident Shokai considered the implications of his decision. Samarqand, a city deeply rooted in Jadidist culture, had limited influence from external factions. Its people, for the most part, were supportive of Shokai's party. Suppressing the unrest here would maintain a stronghold in the heartland of Turkestan and send a strong message that the government stood by its supporters. With a heavy heart, Shokai chose to suppress the turmoil in Samarqand. Mishrabs and National Guard units were deployed swiftly, their presence felt throughout the city. Protesters were met with force, as the authorities sought to restore calm. Samarqand, once a city steeped in history and culture, became an arena of clashes between those demanding change and those determined to maintain the status quo.

As the government tightened its belt, the people of Turkestan felt the pinch of austerity. While President Shokai spoke of future prosperity, the present bore the weight of job losses and economic uncertainty. Factories, once humming with activity, now stood silent. The surge of unemployment was palpable as workers who once toiled tirelessly found themselves without jobs to support their families. In the teahouses and bazaars, conversations were filled with stories of neighbors and friends joining the ranks of the unemployed. The lines at job centers grew longer, and uncertainty about the future loomed large in the minds of Turkestan citizens.\n\nTrade disruptions, another consequence of the government's measures, added to the daily struggles. Turkestan's markets were in flux as imported goods became scarcer, and prices soared. Shelves that once held a variety of foreign products now displayed empty spaces. Families felt the impact as the cost of imported goods, from clothing to everyday necessities, became increasingly unaffordable. The once-familiar products from foreign lands were now out of reach for many. Business owners and traders, too, grappled with the changes. Trade routes that had long sustained Turkestan's commerce were suddenly severed or altered, forcing them to adapt to new realities."
turkestan.213.a: "They will feel the change soon."

turkestan.214.t: "A Helping Hand in Troubled Times"
turkestan.214.d: "The sun dipped below the horizon in Turkestan, casting long shadows over the bustling streets of Tashkent. In these trying times, President Shokai made a solemn promise to his people. In the face of economic turmoil and growing unrest, his government had chosen to prioritize the well-being of its citizens. With unwavering determination, Shokai's government rolled out a comprehensive program aimed at offering immediate relief to the population. The government implemented subsidies to lower the cost of essential goods, ensuring that even the most vulnerable citizens could afford daily necessities. Markets that had been barren now saw goods returning to their shelves. Food distribution centers sprung up across major cities, offering provisions to those in need. Families struggling to put meals on their tables found solace in these lifelines of sustenance. Unemployment benefits and financial aid packages were swiftly introduced to support those who had lost their jobs. These measures provided a semblance of security in times of uncertainty. The effect of these relief measures was immediately apparent. Families, burdened by the fear of hunger and financial ruin, began to breathe a sigh of relief. Turkestan's markets buzzed with activity once more, as shopkeepers restocked their stalls and merchants resumed their trade. Yet, the road ahead was not without its challenges. The strain on government resources was undeniable. Subsidies and aid packages came at a significant cost, putting pressure on an already fragile economy. The question of how to sustain these relief efforts in the long term now weigh heavily on Shokai's administration."
turkestan.214.a: "The cost for immediate relief are high."

turkestan.215.t: "Divided Country - Divided Crises"
turkestan.215.d: "Madamin-Bek, seated in his makeshift office within Ferghana's administrative center, contemplated the dire state of Turkestan's economy. As a ruler of a region endowed with fertile lands and agricultural wealth, he knew that his choices could reshape the economic landscape. The crisis was reaching a tipping point, and he was faced with a critical decision. Madamin-Bek considered doubling down on Ferghana's self-sufficiency measures: the fertile fields of Ferghana had always been a source of pride for its people. Embracing local autonomy meant reinforcing these values and further distancing the region from Turkestan's troubles. Alternatively, Madamin-Bek could choose to seek cooperation with other Turkestan factions and the Shokai government."
turkestan.215.a: "Self-sufficient measures for Ferghana."
turkestan.215.b: "Seek collaborative reforms with Shokai's government."

turkestan.216.t: "Dissent Among the Ferghana Government"
turkestan.216.d: "Ferghana Valley, with its lush fields and diverse population, had long been a place of coexistence and tension. At the heart of these complexities lay the Russian peasant settlers who had carved their lives into this fertile land, while the local population, steeped in their own traditions, watched warily. For years, these two communities had managed an uneasy coexistence, each harboring their own dreams of autonomy and control over their destiny. The Ferghana Peasant Army, led by Konstantin Monstrov and aligned with Madamin-Bek's government, had once fought alongside them, seeking to protect the Russian settlers from Mujahideen threats.\n\nHowever, Madamin-Bek's latest decision to embrace collaborative economic reforms had sown the seeds of discontent among the settlers. As rumors spread like wildfire through the valley, concerns deepened, and whispers of resistance became louder. Konstantin Monstrov, a man who had once been Madamin-Bek's staunch ally, found himself caught in a storm of uncertainty. He had rallied the settlers, promising to safeguard their way of life, their farms, and their autonomy. But now, the promise of reform threatened the very foundation of the Russian settlers' existence.\n\n\"Your Excellency,\" Monstrov began, addressing Madamin-Bek in a tense meeting, \"we've fought together, bled together, but now the settlers fear that our struggle has been in vain. They see these reforms as an encroachment on their way of life. Our relationship with the locals has always been delicate, and this move may lead to open conflict. We must tread carefully.\"\n\nMadamin-Bek, once the hero of Ferghana, now faced resistance from those who had stood at his side. As the settlers' grievances grew, so did the rift between them and the local population. Tensions simmered beneath the surface, threatening to boil over into a conflict that could tear Ferghana Valley apart. The once-united front was cracking, and Madamin-Bek's government found itself grappling with the weight of uncertainty. The road to collaborative reforms, it seemed, was fraught with peril, and the unity of Turkestan was hanging in the balance."
turkestan.216.a: "The Russians should not decide for us."

turkestan.217.t: "Threat of Divided Economies"
turkestan.217.d: "The leadership of Turkestan stood at a crossroads, gazing at a dilemma that had been brewing beneath the surface for far too long. In the heart of this multifaceted nation, Ferghana had emerged as both a vital contributor to Turkestan's prosperity and a potential challenge to its unity. Mustafa Shokai, at the helm of Turkestan's government, recognizes the undeniable truth: Ferghana is an integral part of the republic's economic fabric. Its fertile fields, rich agricultural output, and bustling trade has long contributed to the nation's well-being. Yet, recent developments in Madamin-Bek's fiefdom posed a troubling question - could Ferghana's newfound self-sufficiency threaten Turkestan's stability?\n\nShokai addressed the issue directly, gathered alongside his advisors, and presented his perspective. \"Ferghana is not just any region within our diverse republic. For years, our nation has thrived on the products, trade, and resources that flow from this region. Its success has been our success, and we have celebrated it as such. But now, Madamin-Bek's efforts to make Ferghana self-sufficient are undeniably affecting our republic's economic balance.\"\n\nAs Ferghana continued to assert its economic autonomy, Shokai's government faced a critical decision on how to respond to this growing challenge. Ferghana's self-sufficiency threatened to undermine the unity of Turkestan, and Shokai's government sought ways to assert its influence. One option was to impose an economic blockade on Ferghana by controlling and blocking the critical railroads connecting the region to the rest of Turkestan. This would disrupt the flow of goods in and out of Ferghana, putting pressure on its economy. While this might weaken Ferghana's government economically, it could also lead to resentment and potentially radicalize the population. This choice reflects Shokai's determination to maintain control over the entire country, even at the cost of economic hardships. On the other hand, Shokai's government could choose to invest heavily in the development of other regions within Turkestan, with the aim of reducing dependence on Ferghana's resources. By fostering economic growth and self-sufficiency elsewhere, they could decrease Ferghana's leverage over the republic. However, this approach would take time to yield results and required substantial financial investments. This option represents Shokai's commitment to preserving the unity of Turkestan by strengthening regions outside of Ferghana."
turkestan.217.a: "Introduce economic blockade."
turkestan.217.b: "Focus on developing other regions."

turkestan.218.t: "Miner Strikes in Sülüktü"
turkestan.218.d: "The coal-rich city of Sülüktü in Kyrgyz region of Tian-Shan had long been a cornerstone of Turkestan's industrial might. Its mines had fueled the fires of progress, contributing significantly to the nation's energy needs and economic prosperity. However, in recent days, the dark tunnels beneath Sülüktü had become the stage for a different kind of drama, one that threatened to plunge the region into turmoil. The coal miners of Sülüktü had risen in protest. Fueled by grievances over working conditions, wages, and safety concerns, their strike had paralyzed the coal production, sending shockwaves through the region's power plants and industries. Mustafa Shokai, the leader of Turkestan, faced a formidable challenge. The nation's energy supply hung in the balance, and the striking miners demanded a response.\n\nThere are two choices for the government how it should address the strikes. On the one hand, we can negotiate with the miners, but on the other hand we can opt for a heavy-handed approach."
turkestan.218.a: "Negotiate with the miners."
turkestan.218.b: "Use force to quell the strike."

turkestan.219.t: "1st May Demonstrations in Tashkent"
turkestan.219.d: "The first of May arrived with a sense of anticipation in Tashkent, the most industrially developed city of Turkestan. For the workers, it was a day to celebrate their labor, their contributions to society, and their unity. But this year, the celebrations carried an undercurrent of tension that threatened to disrupt the harmony of the day. The streets of Tashkent were festooned with banners and flags, and the city's workers and residents turned out in force. ERK, the opposition political party, had organized a massive May Day demonstration, calling for workers' rights, better living conditions, and an end to what they saw as the government's oppressive policies. As the sun climbed higher in the sky, a sea of protesters flooded the central square. The atmosphere was filled with chants, songs, and passionate speeches that resonated with the crowd. Men and women, young and old, raised their voices in unison, demanding change. The government, led by Mustafa Shokai, faced a difficult decision. While they acknowledged the people's right to peaceful assembly, the sheer scale of the protest and the fiery rhetoric of the ERK leaders raised alarms. Shokai gathered his advisors to discuss the situation.\n\nShokai can choose to respect the people's right to assemble and express their grievances. Allowing the peaceful demonstration to continue without interference may help in voicing the demonstrators' grievances and maintaining democratic values. However, it could also allow ERK to mobilize and gain further support.\n\nAlternatively, Shokai can choose to disperse the protesters, fearing that the demonstration could escalate into violence or turn into a show of defiance against his government. Ordering the police to intervene, using tear gas and batons to break up the gathering, may disrupt the protest but also risk increasing opposition to Shokai's government."
turkestan.219.a: "Allow peaceful protest."
turkestan.219.b: "Order to disperse the crowds."

turkestan.220.t: "Crisis on the Border"
turkestan.220.d: "The East Turkestan civil war had sent shockwaves across the region, but our Republic found itself at the heart of an unfolding humanitarian crisis. In the border regions, particularly in East Pamir and Pishpek, the turmoil in Kashgar had triggered a mass exodus of refugees, most of whom were of Kyrgyz origin. As the news of this crisis reached the capital, a sense of urgency permeated the highest echelons of government. Reports from the border towns spoke of desperate families, their lives upended by violence and uncertainty, crossing into Turkestan seeking refuge. The dusty roads leading from Kashgar and Dihua to Turkestan's border regions were now crowded with people, young and old, clutching what little belongings they could carry.\n\nOpening the borders and offering humanitarian aid seemed the most compassionate choice, one that Turkestan could be proud of. Refugees would find safety, shelter, and relief in Turkestan, despite a great pressure on our budget. Some members of the Cabinet argued for caution. Under this approach, Turkestan would limit access at the border, subject refugees to stringent security checks, and direct them to established refugee camps. While this would reduce the strain on urban resources, it risked lacking of resources of the National Guard to control the situation. Finally, there were voices in the government calling for a stricter response. Turkestan would secure its borders, preventing refugees from entering. This would prioritize national security and stability, but would greatly demonize the government in the eyes of our citizens. The cost to pay for this decision can be too high."
turkestan.220.a: "Open the borders for the refugees!"
turkestan.220.b: "Limit the border access."
turkestan.220.c: "Secure the border, turn the refugees away!"

turkestan.221.t: "Shadows of the Silk Road"
turkestan.221.d: "The ongoing civil war had unintended consequences that rippled across the region, even to the remote reaches of East Pamir. As the conflict in East Turkestan escalated, so did the demand for illicit goods on the black market. Our country, situated at the crossroads of Central Asia, found itself in the middle of this shadowy trade. The black market, always a persistent presence in the region, experienced unprecedented growth during the East Turkestan crisis. Smugglers, opportunists, and criminal networks capitalized on the chaos, flooding the market with contraband. Everything from weapons and drugs to stolen goods and counterfeit currency found its way onto the illicit market. President Shokai's government could not ignore the surge in black market activity. His administration had always been committed to maintaining law and order. They argued that clamping down on the black market was essential to curb criminal activity, preserve Turkestan's security, and protect the well-being of its citizens. Some voices in the government proposed a more pragmatic approach. They argued that with our struggling economy, it would be wise to regulate and tax the black market. Another proposal emphasized the practical benefits of the black market, as the revenue generated from the black market can be used to fund the National Guard"
turkestan.221.a: "Crackdown on the black market!"
turkestan.221.b: "Tolerate it for the sake of economic growth."
turkestan.221.c: "Fund the National Guard by exploiting the black market."

turkestan.222.t: "The Turkestan Tenga"
turkestan.222.d: "During the Civil War, the turbulent period witnessed the issuance of the Turkestan Rouble by the State Bank of Tashkent, a vestige of Soviet Turkestan. Despite the shift towards a democratic era, the Turkestan Rouble persisted as the primary currency in the aftermath of the conflict, supplemented by a prevalence of barter transactions. Foreign trade relied on Russian roubles, exposing Turkestan to the economic fluctuations of its neighbor. The subsequent crash of the Russian market triggered inflation, sparking an urgent need for Turkestan to establish its own national currency. In response to the economic crisis, the government of Turkestan embarked on a significant financial reform – the establishment of the Central Bank of Turkestan. This marked a crucial step toward economic autonomy and stability.\n\nThe decision was made – the Turkestan Tenga would be the cornerstone of this financial metamorphosis. The air buzzed with anticipation as the populace awaited a currency that would truly belong to them. At a rate of 1 Rouble to 10 Tenga, the Tenga was set to reclaim the narrative of Turkestan's economic destiny. As the Tenga made its debut, currency exchange programs unfolded across the land. Banks became hubs of transformation, exchanging the old Roubles for the new Tenga. The people, now armed with a currency uniquely theirs, embarked on a journey of economic rejuvenation. Beyond the tangible currency, the newly established Central Bank of Turkestan assumed a pivotal role in sculpting the nation's monetary policy. As the custodian of economic stability, it undertook the responsibility of regulating the money supply, interest rates, and currency issuance. Ensuring the health of the financial sector was paramount. The Central Bank, as the nation's financial custodian, implemented rigorous regulatory and supervisory frameworks to fortify banks and financial institutions against risks."
turkestan.222.a: "Hopefully, it will present some relief."

turkestan.223.t: "Offer From the Russo-Asiatic Bank`"
turkestan.223.d: "In the midst of the economic crisis, a fateful letter arrived from the Russian-Asian Bank - a beacon of hope and danger. The bank unexpectedly agreed to a loan. The offer, like a shimmering mirage, offered a chance for financial salvation. A loan, solid, but at high interest, lay before our government like a double-edged sword. The promise of immediate relief beckoned, but at the same time the shadow of potential long-term bondage loomed. The choice, though seemingly simple, was fraught with serious consequences. Turkestan stood at a crossroads, caught between the urgent need to revitalize the economy and a dangerous dependence on an unstable neighbor. The Russian-Asian Bank, which was characterized by dubious generosity, offered an agreement that could either provide a temporary reprieve or plunge the country into further vulnerability. After all, we can always reject another generous offer from the Russians..."
turkestan.223.a: "We should relieve the burden of our citizens."
turkestan.223.b: "But... we should not get into this bondage."

turkestan_national_union.1.t: "Shokai's Gamble"
turkestan_national_union.1.d: "The dust of the civil war had barely settled, and the echoes of conflict still lingered in the air. Shokai, now at the helm of a beleaguered Turkestan, recognized the fragility of the post-war landscape. The ghosts of dissent and the looming specter of chaos necessitated decisive action. With a vision to prevent the recurrence of civil strife, Shokai set his eyes on the nucleus of power — the executive office. His proposal was audacious, aiming to significantly expand the scope of his authority. The move, while viewed as necessary by his staunch supporters, sent ripples of apprehension through the populace. Accusations of tyranny echoed in the alleyways, raising concerns about the preservation of democratic ideals in the new Turkestan.\n\nHowever, Shokai, pragmatic in his approach, opted to navigate the treacherous waters with a degree of democratic legitimacy. The Khalq Majlisi, Turkestan's parliamentary institution, became the battleground for the clash of ideals. Shokai, seeking to bolster not only his own authority but also the stature of the Milliy Ittihod party, presented the case for an empowered executive office. The halls of the Khalq Majlisi buzzed with fervent debate and impassioned speeches. Supporters rallied behind Shokai's vision, highlighting the need for a strong hand to guide Turkestan into stability. Opposition voices, however, cried foul, labeling the move as a dangerous shift towards authoritarianism. The outcome of the Khalq Majlisi vote hung in the balance, a delicate dance of political maneuvering. Shokai, cognizant of the stakes, understood that the success of his proposal could shape the destiny of a nascent nation. The future of Turkestan teetered on the precipice of choice, as the parliament weighed the balance between authority and democracy."

turkestan_national_union.2.t: "Khalq Majlisi of Turkestan"
turkestan_national_union.2.d: "The echoing chambers of Khalq Majlisi resonated with the complex political landscape of Turkestan. Comprising 54 members, the assembly was a mosaic of diverse identities, split into two curias reflecting the religious composition of the region. On one side stood the 36 representatives of the majority Muslim population, encompassing Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Pamir peoples. Opposite them were the 18 members representing the Russian and Jewish communities. In the delicate dance of political affiliations, the Milliy Ittihod held a slight majority with 21 members. Yet, Shokai found himself at a crossroads, seeking to push through the \"Executive Empowerment Act\" that would significantly expand his powers. The Qadhimist conservatives of Ittifoqi Muslimin, numbering 20, presented a formidable bloc, raising doubts about unanimous party support. The remaining members, scattered between ERK and non-partisans, added another layer of uncertainty to the vote. The non-Muslim representatives, particularly the Russians, carried the weight of the Turkestan Military Organisation's influence. Their allegiance was a delicate balance that required careful and strategic lobbying. As Shokai navigated the intricacies of parliamentary politics, the fate of the Executive Empowerment Act hung in the balance. Every vote became a potential pivot point, and alliances within the Majlisi would play a crucial role in shaping the future trajectory of Turkestan."

turkestan_national_union.3.t: "Ittifoqi Muslimin's Conditions"
turkestan_national_union.3.d: "The air in the negotiation room hung heavy with anticipation as representatives from the Milliy Ittihod and Ittifoqi Muslimin gathered to discuss the fate of the Executive Empowerment Act. The coalition, though fragile, held the promise of unity in a post-civil war Turkestan. Ittifoqi Muslimin, embodying conservative values and traditions, sought assurances that their ideological principles would be upheld in the new era. The core demand from Ittifoqi Muslimin was a commitment to align governance and legislation with Sharia principles. This encompassed both civil and criminal laws, ensuring that the legal framework adhered to Islamic tenets. Furthermore, a critical component of the negotiations revolved around education. Ittifoqi Muslimin sought to influence the educational curriculum, emphasizing the teaching of Islamic values and history, as well as limiting the Jadidist influence of the new-Method schools. Moreover, our coalition partners emphasized economic policies rooted in Islamic economic principles, such as reducing interest-based transactions, promoting equity, and supporting businesses aligned with conservative values."
turkestan_national_union.3.d2: "The negotiation room bore witness to a tense atmosphere as representatives from the Milliy Ittihod and Ittifoqi Muslimin grappled with the remnants of a fractured alliance. The scars of past betrayals were still fresh, and the demands presented by Ittifoqi Muslimin carried the weight of their ideological convictions and a history of shifting allegiances. Ittifoqi Muslimin pressed for a direct role in overseeing the adherence to Islamic principles in governance. This demand aimed not only at ideological alignment but also sought to establish a mechanism to prevent future deviations from their shared values. Moreover, our coalition partners emphasized economic policies rooted in Islamic economic principles, such as reducing interest-based transactions, promoting equity, and supporting businesses aligned with conservative values. Acknowledging the breach in trust, Ittifoqi Muslimin proposed terms for reparations. These included public recognition of their grievances, a commitment to rectify past injustices, and a pledge to rebuild the trust that had been eroded during their prior alignment with Madamin-Bek."

turkestan_national_union.5.t: "Influential Lobby of the Vadhyaev Brothers"
turkestan_national_union.5.d: "In the intricate tapestry of Turkestan's history, the Vadhyaev family emerged as key players, their origins traced back to Bukhara, where the Jewish community navigated the intricate web of discriminatory measures imposed by the Muslim majority. Despite these challenges, the Vadhyaevs thrived in trade, particularly in the realm of dyes. Legend whispers that a fortuitous shipment from Russia brought them unexpected wealth, propelling them into the echelons of influence. Haim Vadhyaev, the patriarch, laid the foundation for a thriving family business in the dye trade. His sons, including Isaac-Borukh, Neryo, Zion, and Yakub, inherited the mantle and expanded their endeavors. Yakub and Sion achieved unparalleled success, transforming their family firm into the formidable \"Vadhyaev Brothers\" trading house. The brothers exhibited exceptional acumen, venturing beyond trade to establish a textile combine with the acquisition of the Ivanovo-Voznesenskaya manufactory. In the nascent days of Turkestan autonomy in 1917 under Mustafa Shokai, Yakub Vadhyaev even held a ministerial role, embodying the intertwining of economic influence and political collaboration.\n\nNow, as Turkestan emerged from the crucible of civil war, the Vadhyaev brothers wielded their economic prowess, seeking assurances and subsidies for their company, a request deeply intertwined with their historic contributions. The Vadhyaev brothers pressed for substantial financial subsidies to bolster their textile combine, citing their pivotal role in supporting Mustafa Shokai's government during the turbulence of the civil war. Recognizing their economic significance, the brothers sought assurances of stability in trade policies and economic conditions. This encompassed protection from arbitrary regulations and a conducive environment for their businesses to thrive. To safeguard their interests, the Vadhyaevs requested representation in key economic committees. This move aimed at securing their influence in decision-making processes that could impact their economic ventures. As proponents of charitable endeavors, the Vadhyaevs urged for government support in infrastructure development, especially in areas where their businesses held sway. This included requests for improved transport networks and utilities."

turkestan_national_union.6.t: "Faith in the Balance"
turkestan_national_union.6.d: "The decision to seek the backing of the influential Vadhyaev brothers resonates through the streets, stirring a fervor among the Muslim population. Voices of dissent rise, as faithful believers gather to express their concerns. The decision to align with the wealthy Jewish community has ignited a spark of discontent among the Muslim factions within Ittifoqi Muslimin and Milliy Ittihod. Protesters, driven by religious fervor, demand an explanation from their leaders. The air is charged with tension as the delicate balance between religious principles and political alliances hangs in the balance. The faithful question whether this move compromises the integrity of their cause, and the leaders find themselves navigating the complex terrain of faith and pragmatism.\n\nWith the government in stress, Shokai is presented with a possibility to address the faithful directly, acknowledging their fears and emphasizing the pragmatic necessity of seeking support from the Vadhyaev brothers. Shokai should also publicly state that this alliance is a means to strengthen the country economically and that religious values will not be compromised. Moreover, respected religious leaders should be invited to endorse the decision, hoping to sway public opinion in favor of the practical benefits. On the other hand, a discreet  approach can be chosen. By engaging influential religious leaders in private discussions, we can seek their support and understanding. Shokai aims to convince them that the alliance with the Vadhyaev brothers is a temporary necessity for the greater good. By gaining the support of key religious figures, he hopes to quell the unrest among the Muslim population without openly challenging the decision in the public domain."

turkestan_national_union.7.d: "Within the hallowed halls of Milliy Ittihod, a profound ideological schism surfaces as Shokai proposes the Act to strengthen executive powers. The party, founded on Jadidist principles, finds itself torn between the vision of its founder, Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, and Shokai's pragmatic approach. Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, the venerable founder and current foreign minister, leads the dissenting faction. He, along with the more liberal members of the party, perceives Shokai's initiatives as a departure from the Jadidist ideals that once inspired the party's inception. The group emphasizes the need to reclaim these principles, advocating for a more decentralized, participatory governance structure. Shokai faces a direct challenge from the Jadidist faction. They demand the reinstatement of Jadidist principles within the party's manifesto, decrying what they see as a drift toward a Russophile stance. Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan insists on the appointment of Shoh-Islom Shagiahmetov, a respected Jadidist educator, as the new minister of education. On the other hand, Shokai can turn to a more populist and pragmatic approach. He can appeal directly to the party's grassroots members, organizing town hall meetings and rallies to gather support for the Act. Shokai emphasizes the urgency of a strong government to lead Turkestan through post-war reconstruction and economic recovery. He taps into the party's nationalist sentiments, framing the Act as a necessary step for a robust, independent Turkestan."

The air thickened with anticipation, and the eyes of the parliamentarians bore the weight of the nation's destiny. Minister-President of Turkestan, fueled by the desire for a firm grip on the reins of power, presented the Executive Empowerment Act. The proposal, however, sent ripples of unease through the assembly, as its authoritarian undertones reverberated in the hallowed halls. As the details unfolded, Shokai advocated for an all-encompassing authority, concentrating power tightly around the Presidency. The Act, in its authoritarian form, included clauses empowering the president to unilaterally enact laws and dissolve the parliament at will. Shokai argued that such measures were imperative for rapid recovery and stability, and debarment of the future civil conflict.\n\nWithin the parliament, reactions were varied. The Milliy Ittihod members, some loyal to Shokai, some not, found themselves at odds with the departure from the Jadidist and democratic principles. The ERK members, survivors of the tumultuous events, observed with caution. The specter of authoritarianism, a shadow from the past, loomed over their deliberations. Non-partisan members, embodying diverse opinions, grappled with the delicate balance between stability and individual freedoms, especially for their communities. The Qadhimist members frown on the Minister-President. As Shokai concluded his presentation, the chamber became a crucible of dissent. Aware of the mounting concerns, Shokai opened the floor for discussion. The Qadhimist conservatives, in an attempt to salvage the democratic principles, suggested a more balanced approach. This alternative proposal sought to dilute the authoritarian amendments, introducing checks and balances. It called for parliamentary approval on significant decisions, limiting the president's ability to unilaterally wield power. Debate ensued as the parliamentarians wrestled with the two conflicting visions. The fate of the nation hinged on this crucial decision, and the delicate dance between authority and democracy unfolded within the hallowed halls of the Khalq Majlisi."

The resonating echoes of parliamentary voices marked the inception of a new era, one that would redefine the balance of power in Turkestan. Mustafa Shokai, having secured the legal arsenal to strengthen his grasp on authority, wasted no time in wielding the newfound powers. The first stroke of his executive brush was to dissolve the existing government, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the political landscape. In a bold move, he announced snap elections, scheduled to transpire within the next three months.\n\nThe move triggered a storm of dissent within the Milliy Ittihod party. A vocal faction, led by the charismatic Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, vehemently opposed Shokai's decision. Abdurrashidkhan, an ardent defender of Jadidist principles, rallied against what he saw as a departure from the party's foundational ideals. The party, once united in purpose, now found itself at the crossroads of ideological schism. Simultaneously, the dissent echoed beyond party lines. Ittifoqi Muslimin, once aligned with Shokai's government, declared a 'full break.' The radicals within the party condemned the majority in the parliament for succumbing to Shokai's vision. The air was thick with discontent, yet even if they united in opposition, the numbers weren't in their favor to pass a no-confidence motion. The stage was set for a political showdown, with the looming elections casting a shadow over the aspirations of Shokai's adversaries. The Emergency Empowerment Act had carved a path towards an era of authority, but the turbulence within the parliament hinted at challenges yet to come. The journey towards a new Turkestan had begun, and the choices made in the corridors of power would shape the nation's destiny."

The very essence of Turkestan's democratic principles was at stake. As the parliamentary debate unfolded, a coalition of dissent emerged. United against the perceived abuse of power, the Qadhimists joined forces with the faction of Milliy Ittihod staunchly opposed to Shokai's authoritarian inclinations. Together, they presented a formidable front against the proposed act. The debates echoed through the chambers, filled with impassioned arguments and fervent pleas for the preservation of democratic values. The balance tipped, and the act faced overwhelming condemnation. The parliament, in a moment of resolute decision, passed a vote of no-confidence in Shokai's government. The repercussions reverberated beyond the parliamentary walls. The Qadhimists, in alliance with the opposition faction, declared their intent to seek justice through the legal avenues available. Accusations of power abuse were thrust upon Shokai and his closest aides. The corridors of justice would soon bear witness to the unfolding drama of a leader brought to account for his actions.\n\nWith the passage of the vote of no-confidence, Shokai's resignation became inevitable. The constitutional order designated the acting president, Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, the responsibility of navigating Turkestan through the turbulent waters. In his announcement, Abdurrashidkhan not only declared snap elections but emphasized the commitment to restoring the democratic ethos that Turkestan held dear. The fall of authority had rung through the parliamentary halls, setting the stage for a fresh chapter in Turkestan's history. The journey towards renewal and democratic resurgence had commenced, shaped by the choices made in the face of power's delicate balance."

turkestan_national_union.12.t: "Yosh Turkiston"
turkestan_national_union.12.d: "Within the Milliy Ittihod party, the echoes of discontent had grown into a resounding call for change. The majority, led by the more liberal and jadidist factions, had decided that Mustafa Shokai's vision for Turkestan no longer aligned with the party's foundational principles. A decision was reached: Shokai and his loyalists were to be formally removed from the party. As the party majority executed this internal cleansing, Shokai found himself ousted from the political stronghold he once commanded. The air was thick with tension as party members, torn between loyalty to their charismatic leader and adherence to the party's core tenets, made a choice that would redefine the political landscape of Turkestan. However, Shokai, resilient and determined, did not retreat into political oblivion. Instead, he seized the moment to announce the birth of a new movement — 'Yosh Turkiston,' or 'Young Turkestan'. Embracing pan-Turkism and emphasizing social unity and stability, Shokai sought to carve a distinct ideological space for his followers. The stage was set for a political showdown, with the former allies now facing off as rivals. The rift in the ranks of Milliy Ittihod had not only reshaped the party but had given birth to a new force in Turkestan's politics."
turkestan_national_union.12.a: "A rift in the ranks."

turkestan_national_union.13.t: "Case of Mustafa Shokai"
turkestan_national_union.13.d: "The Qadhimists, staunch in their convictions, pushed for legal action against Mustafa Shokai, asserting that his tenure had been marred by abuses of power. The government, now under the leadership of Munawwar Qari Abdurrashidkhan, convened a special committee to deliberate on the crucial question: To sue or not to sue.\n\nThe atmosphere was charged with the weight of responsibility as committee members presented their arguments. Those in favor of legal action emphasized the need for accountability, arguing that a failure to act might set a precedent for unchecked power. The Qadhimists, true to their conservative ideals, believed that the law must be upheld, irrespective of the political ramifications. On the other side of the table, opposing voices raised concerns about the potential backlash. They warned that a legal battle might exacerbate the existing political divisions, fueling tensions in an already fragile Turkestan. The specter of unrest and the possibility of Shokai's supporters rallying against the government cast a shadow over the decision. The committee grappled with the dilemma, weighing the scales of justice against the delicate stability of the nation. As they navigated the intricate web of legal and political consequences, each member carried the burden of choosing between the pursuit of justice and the preservation of a tenuous peace."

turkestan_national_union.14.t: "Flight of the Fallen"
turkestan_national_union.14.d: "In the wake of the decision to pursue legal action against Mustafa Shokai, the noose of justice tightened around the once-mighty leader. Unwilling to face the consequences of his actions, Shokai orchestrated a daring escape from Turkestan, evading the clutches of the justice system. Details emerged of a clandestine operation that involved trusted confidantes and covert routes. Shokai, once the symbol of authority, slipped away under the cover of darkness, leaving behind a nation in the throes of legal reckoning.\n\nAs the news of Shokai's escape reverberated through Turkestan, the court proceedings unfolded nonetheless. The legal machinery, undeterred by the absence of its primary defendant, moved forward. Mustafa Shokai was tried in absentia, a symbolic act of accountability for the alleged abuses of power during his rule. The courtroom became a stage for legal theatrics as Shokai's defense team presented a vigorous case on his behalf. The attorneys argued that the charges were politically motivated, a desperate attempt by rivals to tarnish Shokai's legacy. They claimed that the former leader had acted within the bounds of executive authority, framing his decisions as necessary measures to maintain stability in a tumultuous time. Despite Shokai's absence, his defense team marshaled every available argument, challenging the validity of the charges and questioning the impartiality of the judiciary. The trial unfolded as a battle of narratives, with the prosecution striving to hold a leader accountable and the defense painting a picture of a persecuted patriot. As the court weighed the evidence and the arguments, the nation watched, holding its collective breath, torn between the pursuit of justice and the echoes of a tumultuous past."

turkestan_national_union.15.t: "A Group of Turkestan 'Refugees'"
turkestan_national_union.15.d: "This night the soldiers that were closely watching the border with [FROM.GetAdjective] suspected a group of people to be not true 'refugees' from Turkestan, as they had introduced themselves to the Border Guard. Apparently, it happened to be that one of the refugees was closely resembling the ex-president of [FROM.GetName], Mustafa Shokai, who was in hiding due to the criminal procedure against him. After several hours of interrogation, this person made full admission that he really is Mustafa Shokai and he asked for asylum within our country. This case was immediately brought to [ROOT.GetLeader] and the discussion began. Some have suggested that due to our relations with Turkestan we should definetely deliver him to Turkestan authorities. The others, however, suggested that perhaps keeping him in our country means we can later establish a collaboration movement in [FROM.GetName], friendly towards us, as Shokai would likely create an exile movement of his own, considering his great political ambitions."
turkestan_national_union.15.a: "Deliver this criminal to the Supreme Court of Turkestan."
turkestan_national_union.15.b: "We should not underestimate his usefulness."

turkestan_national_union.16.t: "The Prodigal Son"
turkestan_national_union.16.d: "Mustafa Shokai's escape was short-lived as the [FROM.GetAdjective] border security and government, bound by legal obligations and diplomatic pressure, extradited the fallen leader back to Turkestan. The once-mighty ruler found himself in the hands of the very justice system he had attempted to evade. Upon his arrival, Shokai was promptly arrested and escorted to a Turkestani courtroom to face the consequences of his actions. The nation, still grappling with the aftermath of his rule, watched intently as the legal proceedings unfolded. The court, now with Shokai physically present, embarked on the final phase of a long and tumultuous legal battle. The charges of power abuse, corruption, and violations of democratic principles were meticulously laid out before the judges. As the prosecution and defense presented their cases, the courtroom became a stage for the culmination of Turkestan's quest for justice. The nation awaited the court's decree, yearning for closure and the assurance that those who wielded power would be held accountable. In the hallowed halls of justice, where the echoes of Shokai's autocratic rule still lingered, the court deliberated. The weight of public expectations bore down on the judges as they prepared to render a verdict that would shape Turkestan's future."
turkestan_national_union.16.a: "Suspence is overwhelming."

turkestan_national_union.17.t: "Rise of the Exile"
turkestan_national_union.17.d: "In a dramatic turn of events, Mustafa Shokai emerged from the shadows, boldly stepping into the public eye in the [FROM.GetAdjective] city of [FROM.Capital.GetName]. He declared the creation of the 'Turkestan Democratic Front,' a movement he asserted to be the legitimate voice of exiles committed to restoring stability and order in Turkestan. Shokai's appearance sent shockwaves through the Turkestani government, prompting swift condemnation of the country that had hosted him. The official statement labeled Shokai's actions as an affront to Turkestan's sovereignty and a blatant disregard for the legal processes that had played out in the homeland. The Turkestan government, in a unified response, underscored its commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice prevailed. Shokai's attempt to rally support from abroad was met with skepticism domestically, as many questioned the legitimacy of an exiled movement seeking to influence the affairs of a sovereign nation."
turkestan_national_union.17.a: "This can lead to diplomatic crisis."

turkestan_national_union.18.t: "The Conviction"
turkestan_national_union.18.d: "In a stunning twist, the Supreme Court has rendered a verdict declaring Mustafa Shokai guilty of the charges leveled against him. The judges meticulously outlined the evidence presented during the trial, emphasizing instances where Shokai's actions were deemed to have overstepped constitutional boundaries. The courtroom fell into a hushed silence as the judgment was pronounced. Shokai, once a formidable political figure, now faced the prospect of legal repercussions. The judges, taking into account the severity of the offenses, have sentenced him to a significant term of imprisonment. The impact of the conviction rippled through Turkestan's political landscape. Milliy Ittihod, the party that had once rallied behind Shokai, saw this as a validation of their concerns. Ittifoqi Muslimin, standing on the opposing side, welcomed the verdict as a triumph of justice. They called for a reevaluation of the political landscape, positioning themselves as advocates for ethical governance and the rule of law. Shokai's newly formed movement, Yosh Turkiston, faced an uphill battle. With its leader now convicted, the movement struggled to maintain its momentum. The charismatic figurehead's fall from grace cast a shadow over the viability of Yosh Turkiston as a political force."
turkestan_national_union.18.a: "Justice."

turkestan_national_union.19.t: "The Acquittal"
turkestan_national_union.19.d: "In a surprising turn of events, the Supreme Court has delivered a verdict declaring Mustafa Shokai innocent of the charges leveled against him. The judges, after careful consideration, concluded that Shokai, during his presidency, had operated within the legal boundaries of the constitution. The controversial Executive Empowerment Act, which had sparked heated debates, was found to be in alignment with the recommendations of the constitutional committee. The courtroom buzzed with a mix of astonishment and disbelief as the decision reverberated through the nation. Shokai, once facing the prospect of severe consequences, emerged from the legal ordeal unscathed.\n\nMilliy Ittihod, the party that had once rallied behind Shokai, now deeply dissatisfied with the verdict, contemplated its next move. Ittifoqi Muslimin, standing on the opposite side, expressed their discontent with the outcome, questioning the integrity of the legal system. The turbulence within the political landscape was palpable, and the aftermath of the trial cast a long shadow over the nation. The acquittal not only solidified Shokai's position but also intensified the political polarization within Turkestan. As the nation grappled with the implications of the court's decision, the echoes of the trial continued to shape the contours of its future political landscape."

turkestan.2.d: "The tranquil mountain region of East Pamir is gripped by chaos as the Mujahideen divisions launch a violent uprising against our Jadidist rule. In an attempt to discredit our government, these insurgents have resorted to heinous acts of robbery and murder, causing widespread fear and instability among the local populace. The situation demands urgent attention and decisive action to quell the insurgency before it engulfs the entire region.\n\nAs reports of the Mujahideen's actions continue to escalate, suspicions arise that the Bukharan Karaul-begi, Ibrahim-Bek, may be behind this unrest. His clandestine support to the insurgents has emboldened their cause, making it even more imperative to swiftly crush the insurgency and restore peace to the troubled region.\n\nWith the forthcoming elections looming on the horizon, the insurgency poses a serious threat to the integrity of the democratic process. Should we fail to effectively deal with the unrest, the very foundation of our government could be compromised. The legitimacy of the elections may come under scrutiny, and there may be calls for them to be canceled or, at the very least, postponed until order is restored."

turkestan.100.d: "As in many other cities of the former Russian Empire, the Russian population constituted a significant part of them. Turkestan was no exception, where our largest city and industrial center, Tashkent, has a significant Russian population. It is noteworthy that it was in Tashkent that the great Russian-chauvinist Turkestan Soviet Republic was formed, and it was from Tashkent that the last Russian troops were withdrawn. \n\nIn addition to the large cities, however, Russian settlers also made up a significant peasant population. It was they who formed the backbone of the Monstrov Peasant Army 20 years ago, and now they continue to live peacefully under the warm Turkestan sun.\n\nHowever, it's not all that simple. Recently, incidents of harassment of the Muslim population by the Russian-speaking population have become more frequent. According to the minister-chairman, all these clashes between non-Muslims and Muslims are initiated by Shuro-Ulema in order to unleash ethnic conflicts. But one cannot overlook the lawlessness of the Russian-speaking population, who must remember that here they are at best guests, at worst colonizers."

Representatives of Shuroy-Ulamo were also present at the Council. It was necessary to figure out how to stop the uprising as quickly as possible.\n\nHaving undergone a series of difficult discussions and debates, there are now two main points of view on how to win this conflict. The first is to mobilize more troops and invade the Eastern Pamirs in large numbers, hoping to outnumber the enemies with weapons and men. This was the option proposed by Madamin-Bek and Shuroy-Ulamo.\n\nThe second is to start their own guerrilla movement against the Mujahideen, infiltrating their fighters into their camp under the cover of loyal followers of the Mujahideen, and then launch a surprise attack from outside as well as inside. This is the tactic followed by the Monstrov."

On the one hand, incumbent president Mustafa Shokay, who has been in office since 1917, is the representative of the Jadidist party, Shuroy-Islamiya. He's a kazakh and seeks further cooperation with the Alash Autonomy, a position that has garnered him much hate among the common Kyrgyz and Uzbek population of the region; he is seen as a Russian lapdog and an Alash puppet. On the other hand, there is the candidate from the Kadimist party, Shuroy-Ulamo, Katta Ergash. He is a supporter of traditional values, and seeks cooperation with the Emirate of Bukhara. He also relies on Ottoman and German support and wishes to make Turkestan a part of a single pan-Islamic state.\n\nHowever, with some of the region under control of Mujahideen, the unrest can spread across the nation, and the fate of democracy is uncertain."

While this will possibly get us more supporters among the workers, it could also weaken our core electorate in Pishpek and Samarkand, who see socialism as too radical ideology.\n\nOn the other hand, we can focus on Kadimist-majority areas, such as Turkestan and East Pamir. This can weaken the Shuroy-Ulamo positions, but at the same time, we will lose some points against Socialists.\n\nFinally, we can turn to our core regions of Samarkand and Pishpek and hope that this time we will succeed."

It is unknown if the parties will agree to cooperate, but the first step has already been made.\n\nThe one hot topic on the talks is the Land Reform, which, according to the ERK party programme, should be nationalized, and the agriculture should be collectivized, which is not tolerated by any of the Shuroy-Islamiya members and can greatly dissapoint our liberal supporters.\n\nThe second most important topic is the freedom of strikes and trade unions, which was not under ban, though harshly suppressed by the Government in the previous years."

The ERK has suggested either to nationalize all the land in Turkestan, which will definetely anger most of our supporters, but greatly liberalize the dehkans and workers, or collectivize the agricultural sector. The Shuroy-Islamiya should either agree on one of the principles, or suggest a compromise: voluntary collectivisation. While also not very popular among Shuroy-Islamiya voters, the voluntary collectivisation can be really the way out of the crisis."

trk_elections.10.d: "The negotiations were disrupted by the unwilingness of any of the two parties to cooperate. While the ERK's position is clear, the Shuroy-Islamiya, which is in a weaker position, is risking to lose the elections and our fragile democracy can fall."
trk_elections.10.a: "Disaster!"

trk_elections.11.t: "Trade-Unions Debate"
trk_elections.11.d: "Decided to focus on the strikes and trade-unions state, the talks were indeed hot, with each of the sides evaluating their principled positions where the coalition can exist. The ERK has suggested that the right to strike and create trade unions should be guaranteed by the government and the rights of dehkans and workers should be respected. While Shuroy-Islamiya can agree on this point, though losing some support from more conservative-minded electorate, it seems there is no compromise available for this point. If we don't agree on this topic, we can fail coalition talks."
trk_elections.11.a: "Guarantee the right to strike and form trade unions."
trk_elections.11.b: "That's enough - leave the talks!"

trk_elections.12.t: "Turkestan National Union Announced!"
trk_elections.12.d: "With negotiations passing smoothly, Shuroy-Islamiya and ERK have agreed on guaranteeing the right to strike and form trade unions, thus creating a coalition that will likely succeed in the upcoming elections and win against Kadimists. The Turkestan National Union, receiving the title after the ERK's initial party name, should become the favorite or the democracy has no chance."
trk_elections.12.a: "Great victory for our fragile democracy!"

trk_elections.13.t: "Election Day!"
trk_elections.13.d: "The day of elections has come and now we should provide safety to all the voters and check that the election was fair. The most dangerous electoral region is, of course, in Turkestan and East Pamir, where we can risk that the elections can be disrupted by the Mujahideen."
trk_elections.13.a: "Reinforce our south-eastern regions."

trk_elections.14.t: "Mujahideen Block Polling Stations!"
trk_elections.14.d: "As predicted, the Mujahideen troops in Turkestan and East Pamir have blocked the polling stations, preventing the population from exercising their legitimate constitutional right to vote. We should immediately deal with this situation, or else the elections cannot be considered legitimate and valid."
trk_elections.14.a: "Arrest all who block the polling stations!"
trk_elections.14.b: "Cancel the elections until we deal with them!"
trk_elections.14.c: "Announce our electoral victory even without Turkestan and East Pamir."

trk_elections.15.t: "Chaos in East Pamir"
trk_elections.15.d: "We managed to 'liberate' the polling station from Mujahideen in Turkestan, our capital city, but not in the East Pamir, where the Mujahideen have already blocked most of the polling station and declared the elections unconstitutional and illegitimate. If we don't do something now, we can anger the population."
trk_elections.15.a: "That's enough. Send National Guard to East Pamir!"
trk_elections.15.b: "Cancel the elections until we deal with them!"
trk_elections.15.c: "Announce our electoral victory even without East Pamir."

trk_elections.16.t: "Elections Postponed!"
trk_elections.16.d: "Due to the unstable situation in East Pamir, the government decided to temporary cancel the elections and postpone them until the unrest is dealt with. However, by trying to save the population's right to vote, we only angered them and showed our weakness. More people are joining the side of the Mujahideen, tired of our fragile democracy and the Kadimists have as well announced their support for the East Pamir rioters, completely debasing our political system!"
trk_elections.16.a: "Catastrophic!"

trk_elections.17.t: "Clashes in East Pamir"
trk_elections.17.d: "With our National Guard entering East Pamir, the armed clashes between them and Mujahideen bursted out. Moreover, the Kadimists announced their support for the Mujahideen, leaving us without support of almost half of the Mejlis. President Shokay, while he is still president, should do something, probably even enacting the martial law to save democracy."
trk_elections.17.a: "National Guard will deal with the unrest."
trk_elections.17.b: "Enact the martial law."

trk_elections.18.t: "Part of the National Guard Defects!"
trk_elections.18.d: "Part of the National Guard, being formed and raised by the Mujahideen has defected to their side, leaving us with minority of forces in the region. It seems that the catastrophe cannot be avoided... we should enact martial law and get ready for the worst."
trk_elections.18.a: "Enact the martial law!"

trk_elections.19.t: "Martial Law Enacted!"
trk_elections.19.d: "President Shokay has assumed his emergency powers and enacted the martial law in East Pamir in order to deal with the political crisis. The curfew was installed, however, not only in East Pamir, but in every region of our country with President Shokay seeking for support of anybody to secure the democracy."
trk_elections.19.a: "Ask for Alash support."
trk_elections.19.b: "We need support of Russia."
trk_elections.19.c: "Join forces with Bukhara."
trk_elections.19.e: "We should rely on ourselves."

trk_elections.20.t: "Support Democratic Forces of Turkestan?"
trk_elections.20.d: "Due to the political crisis and disrupted elections in Turkestan, its government and President Shokay has asked us for help. We may send our troops to the East Pamir region to help the Turkestan National Guard suppress the Mujahideen revolt and, perhaps, save the last one stable democratic regime in Turkestan."
trk_elections.20.a: "Send our support."
trk_elections.20.b: "We'll stay out of this."
trk_elections.20.c: "Their autonomy would be their payment."

trk_elections.21.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to support us in our fight against reactionary Mujahideen in East Pamir. Perhaps, together, we have more chances to succeed."

trk_elections.22.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Intervene"
trk_elections.22.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to support us in our fight against reactionary Mujahideen in East Pamir. Perhaps, without their help, we won't succeed."
trk_elections.22.a: "Very bad."

trk_elections.23.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Submission!"
trk_elections.23.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government demanded our submission. They stated that in response for us becoming their autonomy, they would send us all the support and forcefully end our instability."
trk_elections.23.a: "What? Never!"
trk_elections.23.b: "We have no other choice."

trk_elections.24.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused Autonomy"
trk_elections.24.d: "President Shokay has rejected our offer. Well, we would come to them later, but now let them hope they can succeed without power of Russian Army."
trk_elections.24.a: "They will regret this."

trk_elections.25.t: "Mujahideen Crushed!"
trk_elections.25.d: "Despite part of our National Guard defected, we managed to crush most of the Mujahideen troops with the help of our neighbors. The others had fled the region for Afghanistan, opening up the East Pamir for our loyalists. It seems that we have avoided the Civil War."
trk_elections.25.a: "President Shokay holds on."

trk_elections.26.t: "Civil Strife in Turkestan"
trk_elections.26.d: "Despite our efforts to end the crisis, it had only escalated more just for our government to realize that people are mobilizing against our rule.\n\nThe Socialists were able to successfully seize control of a major industrial center, Tashkent, and also fixed their positions in the Ak-Mechet. Part of the National Guard, loyal to the president, was able to defend Samarkand and Pishpek, although it turned out to be divided, and the Mujahideen were firmly entrenched in the East Pamir.\n\nThere were some clashes between the opponents, the main goal of the attackers was to seize key infrastructure and railways. Despite the complexity of the situation, as a result of the chaos, the strengths and weaknesses of each side quickly became clear. It is possible that the echoes of this civil strife will hinder the new government for a long time, but already at this stage the winner was clearly visible."
trk_elections.26.a: "Shokay Loyalists manage to suppress the uprisings."
trk_elections.26.b: "Socialists united the peasantry and workers and won."
trk_elections.26.c: "Mujahideen conducted a series of successful attacks, seizing the initiative."

trk_elections.27.t: "Shuroy-Islamiya Secures Majority!"
trk_elections.27.d: "Despite the fact that elections were not held in the East Pamir, the government has announced them as concluded with Shuroy-Islamiya winning the majority. However, many citizens are dissappointed in the elections and don't see us as the legitimate ones. Without dealing with the Mujahideen, it seems that we won't have enough political power and legitimacy until all regions of our country are under our full control."
trk_elections.27.a: "Ask for Alash support."
trk_elections.27.b: "We need support of Russia."
trk_elections.27.c: "Join forces with Bukhara."

turkestan.8.t: "Fayzulla Khodjaev Enters Turkestan"
turkestan.8.d: "The [UZB.GetName] has recently had to deal with socialist insurgency in the Karshi region. Luckily for them, the uprising was crushed, but unfortunately for us, Fayzulla Khodjaev has crossed the border and is now hiding somewhere in Samarkand. Even now as we speak, that marxist devil snakes his way through our lands, untethered by morals or law."
turkestan.8.a: "Find him and arrest him!"
turkestan.8.b: "We welcome all victims of the Emirate regime"

turkestan.9.t: "Socialist Insurgency in Ak-Mechet"
turkestan.9.d: "It was stupid to think that the socialist movement in Turkestan was weak. Formally, the Union of Muslim Workers is represented by Nazir Torekulov in Turkestan, but he's unlikely to be a big threat. However, with the arrival of Mukhitdinov, he has managed to raise an uprising in the industrial region of Tashkent."
turkestan.9.a: "Send there troops."

turkestan.10.t: "Mukhitdinov Proclaims Workers' Republic in Tashkent"
turkestan.10.d: "Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov has proclaimed a socialist republic in Tashkent. While the idea is seemingly nonsensical and absurd, it has still occurred nonetheless. He's still a threat and he's supported by many proletarians in both Tashkent and our borders, we must remain vigilant."
turkestan.10.a: "Liquidate the unrest at any cost."
turkestan.10.b: "Ask Bukhara for help."

turkestan.11.t: "Turkestan Asks for Help"
turkestan.11.d: "The government of Turkestan has asked us to intervene in Tashkent and help to liquidate the socialist unrest in the border region. If we were to help, we could finally remove this marxist taint once and for all, or we can let the rebels be and have them sow discord in our historic enemies."
turkestan.11.a: "Sure, we will send a force to aid in crushing the rebels."
turkestan.11.b: "A destabilized Turkestan is better for us."

turkestan.12.t: "Bukhara Intervenes in Tashkent."
turkestan.12.d: "The government of [UZB.GetNameDef] has agreed to intervene in Tashkent. Our joint forces have liquidated the unrest with their joint strength. Luckily, Mukhitdinov was also murdered in the crossfire and the uprising was finally suppressed."
turkestan.12.a: "Victory!"

turkestan.13.t: "Bukhara Refused to Intervene."
turkestan.13.d: "Bukhara’s administration has refused to intervene and help us to liquidate the socialist rebels. Left alone, it will be harder for us to suppress the uprising, but we must try lest our brave and proud democracy succumb to chaos."
turkestan.13.a: "At least we tried, we march alone."

turkestan.14.t: "Socialists Crushed"
turkestan.14.d: "We managed to crush socialist rabble rousers once and for all. Instigator of the uprising, Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov, has been slain by our forces in the fighting and it seems nothing can stop us now from achieving our goals."
turkestan.14.a: "Victory!"

turkestan.15.t: "Mukhitdinov Overthrows the Government."
turkestan.15.d: "The protesters not only managed to repulse our forces, but many of our soldiers refused to fire on the protesters, instead joining their ranks. The uprising was supported in Pishkek as well, and it became too much for our regime to bear. The revolutionaries, spewing forth from Tashkent, seized administrative buildings in Pishkek and Osh, and Mukhitdinov arrived in the capital. Later that day he proclaimed the People's Republic of Turkestan."
turkestan.15.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"

turkestan.16.t: "[TRK.GetName] Seizes Zhetisu!"
turkestan.16.d: "The [TRK.GetAdjective] forces have used the moment of [ALO.GetAdjective] weakness to start a sudden invasion of Zhetisu region, which has been their claim since 1918. The forces of [ALO.GetName] had to retreat and capitulate, leaving the whole region of Zhetisu a free real estate."
turkestan.16.a: "Our terrible defeat!"
turkestan.16.b: "We have finally done this!"

turkestan.17.t: "[ALO.GetName] Upholds Zhetisu!"
turkestan.17.d: "Despite the [TRK.GetAdjective] forces have used the moment of [ALO.GetAdjective] weakness to start a sudden invasion of Zhetisu region, which has been their claim since 1918, they never managed to break the defence of [ALO.GetName], which had secured the whole region of Zhetisu under their control."
turkestan.17.a: "We must be proud of ourselves."
turkestan.17.b: "We'll get to them later."

turkestan.18.t: "Verniy Ceasefire."
turkestan.18.d: "Despite the [TRK.GetAdjective] forces have used the moment of [ALO.GetAdjective] weakness to start a sudden invasion of Zhetisu region, their invasion eventually failed. With both sides struggling at the front, the ceasefire was signed."
turkestan.18.a: "This is only the beginning.

turkestan.19.t: "[FROM.GetName] Invaded Aralsk!"
turkestan.19.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] forces has claimed that our government is not legitimate and, therefore, they no longer respect that we hold their 'core' territories. Yesterday they have occupied the Aralsk region, which was their claim since 1918. However, it seems that there is nothing we can do, at least for now."
turkestan.19.a: "We should have never trusted them."

turkestan.22.t: "Verniy Conference"
turkestan.22.d: "The representatives of the [FROM.GetName] has arrived today in Verniy in order to suggest to hold the conference about the future of two our states. The main topic to be discussed is our current borders. To be more precise, disputed territories.\n\nThe [FROM.GetAdjective] government since its independence in 1918 has claimed the territory of Aralsk and the whole region of Zhetisu, from the Verniy city up to the lake Balkhash.\n\nIf we will be able to agree on disputed territories and finally end this topic, the relations between our countries will definetely improve.\n\nHowever, we can just leave the conference and leave this territories under our control, having worsened the relationship, but at least showing that we will fight for every Kazakh."
turkestan.22.a: "Let us talk."
turkestan.22.b: "Send them back - we won't give up our territory."

turkestan.23.t: "Verniy Conference"
turkestan.23.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to hold the conference and discuss disputed territories.\n\nIn fact, there is no much we can ask for. The most important our claim is the whole region of Zhetisu, which covers large amount of territory from Verniy city to the lake Balkhash. It is hard to believe that the Kazakhs will give up the whole region, where the majority of population is Kazakh. In response, however, we can guarantee their independence, the represenation of the Kazakh population in the Mejlis and even look forward to uniting our states into a single federation.\n\nThe second our claim is the north-eastern shore of the Aral Sea with a little town of Aralsk. Our government believes it to become a large sea port one day, moreover, located at the Central Asian Railway.\n\nThere is always a chance that the Kazakh government won't agree on any our term, but we will try to appease them as we can."
turkestan.23.a: "Zhetisu in exchange for guarantees."
turkestan.23.b: "Aralsk. Forget about Zhetisu."
turkestan.23.c: "Demand both for guarantees."

turkestan.24.t: "Zhetisu For Guarantees"
turkestan.24.d: "The [FROM.GetLeader] has approached us with an offer. We should transfer the whole region of Zhetisu to them and in exchange we will guarantee independence of each other, sign military alliance and the [FROM.GetAdjective] government guarantees the representation of all Kazakh population.\n\nWhile this suggestion can seem ridiculuos at first, if we really want to unite our countries into a single state one day - this can be the first step towards it."
turkestan.24.a: "What? Truly ridiculuos!"
turkestan.24.b: "Hold on. This sounds reasonable!"
turkestan.24.c: "Let ask the population instead."

turkestan.25.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
turkestan.25.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has expectedly refused our offer. It seems that they will never cede peacefully the whole region of Zhetisu. We can consider the Conference failed or try to at least negotiate for Aralsk."
turkestan.25.a: "No chances. Leave the conference."
turkestan.25.b: "Let us try to negotiate for Aralsk."

turkestan.26.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
turkestan.26.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has unexpectedly agreed to cede Zhetisu. It seems that it will become the unprecedented case of first peaceful territory transfer in Central Asia. Due to all formalities, the region will be fully transfered in several weeks."
turkestan.26.a: "Splendid!"

turkestan.27.t: "The Verniy Treaty"
turkestan.27.d: "All preparations are now finished. The treaty of Verniy has been signed by both sides as well as ratified. The [FROM.GetName] has withdrawn its military from the region and the population of Zhetisu has been registered as [ROOT.GetNameDef] citizens and voters."
turkestan.27.a: "Let us celebrate this!"

turkestan.28.t: "[FROM.GetName] Suggest the Referendum"
turkestan.28.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to cede Zhetisu only if the local population will vote for this. This is a clever move, which shows that the [FROM.GetName] cares about their citizens. We may respect their suggestion, but at the same time, if we fear that the population won't vote for joining us, we can refuse."
turkestan.28.a: "That's a great idea."
turkestan.28.b: "No way, let us try to negotiate for Aralsk."
turkestan.28.c: "No chances. Leave the conference."

turkestan.29.d.alo: "The Zhetisu population has voted for joining [TRK.GetName]. While this has greatly damaged the popularity of our party, it seems that we have nothing to do but to approve of this results. Even if this was our idea to hold the referendum, we can, however, announce that it was rigged by the other side and refuse to cede the territory."
turkestan.29.d.kyr: "The Zhetisu population has voted for joining us. It seems that we can now start to formalize the territory transfer."

turkestan.30.d.kyr: "The Zhetisu population has voted against joining us. It seems that there is nothing we can do, as we can only recognize the results."

turkestan.30.c: "No chances. End the conference."

turkestan.31.t: "[FROM.GetName] Claims the Referendum Was Rigged!"
turkestan.31.d: "To our great surprise, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has claimed that the referendum was rigged. There is no way this can be true, as we had no access to the voting. Moreover, they have suggested to hold the referendum themselves, which makes no sense. It seems that the [FROM.GetAdjective] government just does not want to recognize the results and are rudely interfering into people's will."
turkestan.31.a: "Demand they respect the people."
turkestan.31.b: "No way, let us try to negotiate for Aralsk."

turkestan.33.t: "[FROM.GetName] Leaves the Conference!"
turkestan.33.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives have left the conference, making it clear that they won't cede any territory to us. The relations between our countries are now damaged."

turkestan.34.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives believe that the region of Aralsk, the north-eastern shore of the Aral Sea should belong to them. This is a small region with a small population and without any valuable resources. However, the town of Aralsk has a potential of becoming a large port in the future and a fishing site. In general, our government believes that it is a small price for friendship."
turkestan.34.a: "Alright. Let them have it."
turkestan.34.b: "We demand guarantees in exchange."

turkestan.35.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to cede us Aralsk without any further concessions. They don't lose too much from this deal, but this territory transfer will ensure friendship between our nations."
turkestan.35.a: "Great!"

turkestan.36.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
turkestan.36.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to cede us Aralsk. This was a small price for friendship, but it seems that the [FROM.GetName] did not even bother to think about it more profoundly."

turkestan.38.t: "[FROM.GetName] Haggles."
turkestan.38.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government believes that mutual guarantees is a large price for such a small region like Aralsk. They believe that we should cede the territory without any further concessions."

turkestan.38.b: "Alright. If they want so."

turkestan.39.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks for Aralsk and Zhetisu"
turkestan.39.d: "Without any doubt, our government was outraged by the [FROM.GetAdjective] 'offer'. Even if we get closer relations and mutual guarantees, ceding almost third of our territory is definetely not the best way. We can still agree, but our population won't like this."
turkestan.39.a: "Anything for our independence against Russians."
turkestan.39.b: "No way. Leave the conference."

turkestan.40.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
turkestan.40.d: "To our great surprise, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to cede us both regions. This is a great victory of our diplomacy. We should get ready to formalize all the procedures."

### Decisions ###

### Ideas ###
TRK_lasting_political_crisis: "Rival Governments"
TRK_lasting_political_crisis_desc: "For nearly two decades now, the Turkestan is ruled separately by two governments: the Federal Government, a coalition between the Jadidists and Qadimists in a weak balance under the leadership of Mustafa Shokai, and the Provisional Ferghana Government, under the leadership of Madamin-Bek. While the Madamin-Bek's government has no real authority over the majority of Turkestan's territory, he's supported by some more radical groups, such as Korşirmat's Mujahideen and Monstrov's Peasant Army. The outcome of this confrontation will shape Turkestan's future."
TRK_illusion_of_democracy: "Illusion of Democracy"
TRK_illusion_of_democracy_desc: "It is a stretch to call Turkestan a democratic republic. Elections are held, parties are not banned, and organizations are virtually unregulated. In practice, there is an irremovable power of Minister-President Shokai and a crumbling Jadidist-Kadimist coalition."
TRK_paramilitary_activities: "Active Paramilitaries"
TRK_paramilitary_activities_desc: "The chaotic political landscape of Turkestan is further marred by paramilitary activities, be it Turkestan Military Organisation, an underground Russophilic organisation, the ERK's Turkestan Legion, a socialist panturkist militia of Dehkans, or the Mujahideen of Korşirmat, active in East Pamir mountains. Without efficient control of the Turkestan National Guard, these radical movements can rise to power or cause even more chaos."
TRK_army_of_mishrabs: "Army of Mishrabs"
TRK_army_of_mishrabs_desc: "The Mishrabs are local militia and police units, that became the only possible form of armed forces of Turkestan, due to fractionism of its internal parties and movements.

#1. Having a national culture and living as an independent nation should be the basis of life. This is the dream of all nations. Our goal is to make Turkestan independent and nationalize the government. A nation is based on the unity of language, religion, culture, literature, and tradition.
#2. In free Turkestan, the state structure and administration is a republic, and the basis of power is established by the democratically elected assembly of the nation, or in regions and cities, the region and city assemblies (zemstvo).
#3. The members of the central government will be appointed by the president of the Republic, and the heads of the regions will be appointed by the central government, based on the approval of the national assembly. The chairpersons of regional and city office meetings will be elected at this meeting itself. The procedure for the election of the National Assembly, the Chairman of the Republic, and the regional assemblies will be determined by the first congress of independent Turkestan.
#4. The non-Turkish minority in Turkestan will also enjoy cultural rights. The Turkic peoples should act with one accord to revive the culture of Turkestan.
#5. The national government of Turkestan will rely on the national soldier of Turkestan; military service is compulsory.
#6. In order to maintain internal peace, regional authorities will organize local police, and this association will depend on the national law associations of the country.
#7. Freedom of conscience will be fully ensured in the country. Free management of religious worship and customs will be ensured by the state. No other religious spies are allowed to operate in the country.

tashkent_rail_desc: "§gAsosiy temir yoʻl ustaxonalari, better known as Main Railroad Workshops, was established in 1900 in order to construct railroads and repair locomotives for the Central Asian Railway. The armed troops of the workers of Railroad Workshops played a defining role in establishing Soviet power in Tashkent in October 1917, but were suppressed during the Osipov Mutiny in January 1919. After the war, the factory was transfered to Russia, and since then was used by Russia in order to control the railways of Turkestan. Since 1934, a steel foundry was established. The plant is still an epicentre of both the Russian influence and socialist sentiments."
vadhyaev_brothers: "«Vadhyaev Brothers»"
vadhyaev_brothers_desc: "§gThe founder of the Vadhyaev family business was Haim, a Bukhara Jew, engaged in the dye trade. All the sons of Haim Vadhyaev became merchants of the first guild and received citizenship of the Russian Empire, but the greatest success accompanied Yakub and Sion. In 1902, the Vadyaev family trading firm was transformed into a mutual partnership and then into the \"Vadhyaev Brothers\" trading house. Yakub Khaimovich was a foreman of the Kokand Exchange Committee and a member of the accounting committee of the Russo-Chinese Bank in Kokand. The brothers were engaged in charity and were honorary members of various educational societies in the Fergana Valley. Before the revolution, in 1916, the Vadhyaevs bought the Ivanovo-Voznesenskaya manufactory and thus formed a huge textile combine, where the process began with a cotton field and ended with finished products.§!"

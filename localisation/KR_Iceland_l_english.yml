#Intro Events#

ice.9996.t:0 "Iceland in 1922"
ice.9996.d:0 "Starting in 1874, Iceland had its first taste of independence when Denmark granted the colony the right to home rule and a constitution. As a part of Denmark, Iceland remained neutral throughout the Weltkrieg. After the conclusion of the Weltkrieg, Iceland joined the Mitteleuropa Economic Bloc alongside its master Denmark. This brought a period of prosperity to the island nation as Iceland could now tap into two markets for its main export: fish. The British market continued its lucrative fish imports from Iceland due to the distance between the two islands. Meanwhile, the entry of Icelandic Cod into the European Market became a source of smaller additional funds to help boost Iceland’s economy."
ice.9996.a:0 "What once was..."

ice.9997.t:0 "Iceland in 1925"
ice.9997.d:0 "However, this economic prosperity would not last forever. The British Revolution of 1925 shattered the miracle that post-weltkrieg Iceland was experiencing. As the royalists fled to various corners of the Empire, the British-Icelandic trade route instantly ran dry. The only close remainders of the cod trade were the royalists who fled to Canada but they had more pressing economic issues than resuming Icelandic trade. Thus, Iceland was left wallowing in the wake of the British Revolution since Mitteleuropan economic doctrine dictated that no trade could be enacted with Syndicalist countries."
ice.9997.a:0 "Is no longer..."

ice.9998.t:0 "Iceland in 1932"
ice.9998.d:0 "To help put a stopgap on the massive unemployment that started to rise in the country, the Althing created the City Work-Creation Scheme to put the people to work on manual labour construction projects. This worked for some time but eventually became a divisive topic between the parties in the government. During a city council meeting on the 9th of November 1932, the council debated pulling the plug on the project. News of this reached the population who arrived in droves to riot in front of the building demanding that the Scheme remains in place due to the fact that the economic recession still continued to afflict Iceland. This riot became known as Gúttóslagurinn and ensured that the CWCS remains in effect for the near future of the country."
ice.9998.a:0 "Will this crisis ever end?"

ice.9999.t:0 "Iceland in 1936"
ice.9999.d:0 "While the past decade has been a disaster for the people of Iceland, there still remains a hope for a brighter future over the horizon. Prospective government officials have started crafting plans for large scale public works projects to provide jobs, kick-starting a tourism industry, or even looking into tapping into the geothermal and hydroelectric resources that our island provides us with. Perhaps with a little assistance from Denmark, we can make these dreams come true!"
ice.9999.a:0 "Perhaps the end is near!"

#Cod War Events#
ice.1.t:0 "Iceland expands its fishing zones"
ice.1.d:0 "With our recent change in policy, our fishermen now have a much larger area to trawl fish from. This is expected to increase our haul by large margins. To that end, our merchants have already started looking towards our old trade partners in the British Empire to see if there is a possible economic deal we can make."
ice.1.a:0 "What a bountiful catch!"

ice.2.t:0 "Iceland expands their fishing zone"
ice.2.d:0 "Iceland has recently claimed large swathes of the North Atlantic as their rightful fishing grounds. This is bound to draw the ire of the Syndicalists in Britain but we could perhaps use this occasion to gain support in Iceland to eventually use as a staging ground for the reclamation of the home isles."
ice.2.a:0 "Offer Iceland a deal"
ice.2.b:0 "We can't risk it"

ice.3.t:0 "Iceland expands into British Waters!"
ice.3.d:0 "The Icelanders have expanded into our waters in the North Atlantic. They claim that they are only trying to get over the lingering effects of Black Monday but they nevertheless have created unrest from the Scottish fishermen in the north. They are a small nation and whatever fish they pull in won't affect us too badly but we have a chance to attempt to rekindle the trade agreement that our two Atlantic isles shared before the Revolution."
ice.3.a:0 "Attempt to form a deal"
ice.3.b:0 "There is plenty of fish in the sea"

ice.4.t:0 "Canada offers a deal"
ice.4.d:0 "The merchants of Canada have contacted us to express their interest in an economic deal between our two countries. As the largest successor state to the British Empire, they hope to resume the trade that our islands once shared."
ice.4.a:0 "To our friends in Ottawa!"

ice.5.t:0 "The Union of Britain offers a deal"
ice.5.d:0 "The merchant union in the Union of Britain has come to us to discuss the terms for a potential economic deal. Our two islands once shared a generous trade deal in the past but recent events of the last decade have caused the dissolution of that deal. They claim that now is the perfect time to renew the trade."
ice.5.a:0 "Once more shall the isles trade!"

ice.6.t:0 "Iceland receives multiple trade offers"
ice.6.d:0 "With our recent expansion, the powers on both sides of Atlantic are vying to get their piece of the cake. Both the Canadians and the syndicalists have made overtures to make new deals for our growing supply of cod. Which side should we create a trade agreement with?" 
ice.6.a:0 "Make a deal with Canada"
ice.6.b:0 "Make a deal with the Union of Britain"

ice.7.t:0 "Cod trade deal formed with Iceland"
ice.7.d:0 "Our merchants have successfully secured a deal with Iceland. This deal will help them get out of their economic slump and gain us a valuable ally in the North Atlantic."
ice.7.a:0 "Cross Atlantic cod trade begins!"

ice.8.t:0 "Canadian Cod deal signed"
ice.8.d:0 "The Canadians have agreed to a deal for our cod sales. We will now see a substantial increase in our profits from this."
ice.8.a:0 "A Sweet Catch"

ice.9.t:0 "Icelandic-Canadian deal signed"
ice.9.d:0 "The royalists have signed a deal with the locals of Iceland to encourage them to fish in our waters and take the fish that rightfully belongs to us. We must retaliate or face humiliation over being belittled by such a tiny nation."
ice.9.a:0 "Contest the Waters!"

ice.10.t:0 "Cod deal signed with Iceland"
ice.10.d:0 "Icelandic merchants have opted to resume the trade that our two nations shared in the past. Let the future of our islands grow prosperous together."
ice.10.a:0 "Atlantic cod trade begins"

ice.11.t:0 "Atlantic cod deal signed!"
ice.11.d:0 "With the signing of this deal, the Unionists have agreed to look past our intrusion upon their waters in exchange for giving them a significant portion of our new catches. This will allow a safer environment for our fishermen."
ice.11.a:0 "To our Atlantic allies!"

ice.12.t:0 "The English have made a deal with the Icelanders"
ice.12.d:0 "Those dastardly Unionists in England have struck a deal with Iceland for almost a complete monopoly on the cod sales gathered from the North Atlantic. We can't let that happen! Should we offer Iceland a new deal or quietly back down?"
ice.12.a:0 "A sweeter deal for Iceland"
ice.12.b:0 "A quiet exit from the cod trade"

ice.13.t:0 "Canada approaches us with a new deal"
ice.13.d:0 "Not willing to be pushed out of Iceland over a business deal, the Canadians have approached us with a new deal for our cod sales. They agree to pay a much higher price for the cod compared to our offer from the English. Should we switch sides and go with the Canadian deal, or stay committed to our English deal?"
ice.13.a:0 "To a brighter future with Canada!"
ice.13.b:0 "Our allegiance lies with England"

ice.14.t:0 "Contest the Waters!"
ice.14.d:0 "Icelandic fishing trawlers are claiming our waters and stealing catches that should be rightfully ours! How should we respond?"
ice.14.a:0 "Show them their place"

ice.15.t:0 "Warding off the trawlers"
ice.15.d:0 "Following this outrageous assumption of fishing rights from Iceland, we have sent a small detachment of destroyers out to stop this threat against our fishermen. The destroyers RNS Seawolf and Sparrowhawk have seen success in warding off any Icelandic fisherman who foolishly try to claim our waters."
ice.15.a:0 "Britannia rules the waves"

ice.16.t:0 "Fishermen Attacked"
ice.16.d:0 "In the past couple days, our fishermen have come under assault by a small squadron of destroyers sent from the Union of Britain to contest the waters. Following these attacks, less of our fishermen are willing to trawl the rich waters that we have just claimed ownership of from the English. As a consequence, we are not able to draw in as many fish for sale."
ice.16.a:0 "We won't back down over a few destroyers"

ice.17.t:0 "Retaliate against their trawlers?"
ice.17.d:0 "Some of our population calls for revenge against the English for attacking our fishermen. They clamour for us to equip some of our coast guard vessels to intercept English trawlers operating in our waters."
ice.17.a:0 "Cut their lines"
ice.17.b:0 "No need to stoop to their level"

ice.178.t:0 "Fishermen still in danger"
ice.178.d:0 "Despite our quiet withdrawal from the contested waters, the English continue to harass our fishermen. They are careful to stay within our previous territorial waters yet the English still viciously chase down our boats. Once more the fishermen are requesting that we mobilize some of our coast guard vessels with armament to protect them. Who would we be if we just left our people alone on the high seas?"
ice.178.a:0 "Mobilize the coast guard"
ice.178.b:0 "We can't risk the English response"

ice.179.t:0 "Fishermen march on the Althing"
ice.179.d:0 "Faced with a continual lack of government support, large groups of fishermen have started to gather in the capital to march on the Althing and demand action. This situation reminds many of when back in 1932 a group of workers started a riot over the City Work Creation Scheme. We are now faced with two options: either we cave to the fishermen and mobilize the coast guard, or we can try to plead mercy from the English. What does the government decide?"
ice.179.a:0 "The fishermen must be protected"
ice.179.b:0 "May the English find mercy"

ice.18.t:0 "English fishermen attacked"
ice.18.d:0 "We have received reports that Icelandic patrol boats from the coast guard have been equipped with net cutters and sent after our fishing boats. As the Icelandic vessel sails behind our trawlers, the trailing hook cuts our nets compromising our ability to collect fish. Our force in the North Atlantic is spread too thin to protect all our fishermen. We must send them reinforcements!"
ice.18.a:0 "Reinforce the squadron!"

ice.19.t:0 "A hero returns home"
ice.19.d:0 "In a daring raid against the English fishing trawler Carlisle, the crew of the Ægir found themselves under attack from a new English squadron that was freshly deployed to the region. The commander of the RNS Dunedin ordered his ship to ram the Ægir to protect their fishing vessel. After two ram attempts, the Ægir was barely left upright hanging on by a single screw. In an act of desperation, the commander of the Ægir gave the order to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming firepower advantage that the Dunedin had at her disposal. Serviceman Guðmundur Kjærnested manned the 6 pounder to deter the Dunedin from finishing the fleeing patrol vessel off. News of the crew's heroism has swept across the nation and people are calling for the knighting of Guðmundur Kjærnested."
ice.19.a:0 "Remember the Ægir!"

ice.20.t:0 "Appeal to the Canadians for aid"
ice.20.d:0 "While the Ægir was successful in beating back the English, we don't have enough vessels to sustain an attritional battle against the English. We need some more substantial aid to protect our waters. Something that the Canadians ought to be able to provide. How much should we ask of them?"
ice.20.a:0 "Request troops and a naval force"
ice.20.b:0 "Request just a naval force"

ice.21.t:0 "Iceland requests aid from us"
ice.21.d:0 "The Icelandic government has approached us looking for military assistance. The waters off their coast are becoming more like a warzone every week as the coast guard and republican navy clash against each others fishing ships. Without our protection, the cod deal we have running with them could wither away as the Republican navy could cut off Iceland. They have asked for a detachment of troops to protect the island itself and several vessels to ward off the republican forces. How should we respond?"
ice.21.a:0 "Send them what they ask for"
ice.21.b:0 "We can only spare the naval force"
ice.21.c:0 "We can't spare anything"

ice.22.t:0 "Iceland requests aid from us"

The waters off their coast are becoming more like a warzone every week as the coast guard and republican navy clash against each others fishing ships.

The English destroyer RNS Seawolf had been prowling after a few of our fishing trawlers waiting for an opportune moment to disrupt our haul for the day but the arrival of the Northwest Atlantic Squadron had the destroyer fleeing with its tail between its legs.

Eventually, everyone falls into a routine pattern. He believes if we track the Canadians long enough they will eventually reveal a pattern of when they retire to harbour. Once we learn the timing, we can send a submarine in to blow their armoured cruiser before they even know what is happening, giving us the edge in the Atlantic!"

Our brave submarine crew operating underneath Holbrook took to the sea and carefully made their way to the harbour where the Canadian fleet was docked for the night. Due to the lax nature of the recent conflict in the Atlantic, there seemed to be no real attempt to post adequate sentries to stand guard against something like this. As Holbrook surfaced he fired two salvoes of torpedoes into the HMCS Cumberland. The first salvo was ineffective, bouncing off the hull, but the second salvo ripped a massive hole into the starboard hull immediately causing it to list over and begin to flood. Following this display of fireworks, Holbrook and his crew submerged and began their escape back to the safety of English waters."

For tonight saw the loss of our heavy cruiser the HMCS Cumberland. Aboard, we lost some 300 sailors as the ship sunk fairly quickly. We suspect some of the ammunition was improperly stored below the deck or a that a boiler had a mechanical failure overnight. No matter the reason, this loss is felt deeply by everyone in Iceland and Canada."

By the afternoon, our divers found the smoking gun. Almost literally. They found an intact syndicalist torpedo of English design laying on the bottom of the port. This tragedy was not a mechanical failure but a deliberate assault from the Union of Britain against us! We will not stand for this!"

ice.45.d:0 "News has come from Iceland in regards to the cause of the sinking of the HMCS Cumberland. Divers found an intact English torpedo that failed to detonate when it was launched against the hull of the Cumberland. The explosion was not an internal mechanical failure after all but an insidious attempt by the English to cowardly attack us during the night. Our people clamour for revenge over the loss of our young men aboard the Cumberland who never made it to shore."

ice.48.d:0 "This morning our merchants woke to a horrifying sight: the horizon filled with English warships. In a display of power, the English have stationed their supercarrier the Rebecca 5 miles off the shore from Reykjavik. Bombers have flown over Reykjavik dropping thousands of pamphlets that state that our trade with the Canadians is now at an end and that we are strongly advised to heed whatever demands the English send to us."

ice.50.a:0 "A successful operation"

ice.51.t:0 "Delivering the Demands"
ice.51.d:0 "Following a two week period of blockade, their merchants and traders must be desperate for some ability to resume trade. We have proposed a treaty for them. In the deal, we press our claims over the waters, which naturally give us a sizeable portion of all profits that come from fish caught by Icelandic fishermen. Any disagreement with said policy would be seen as an attack against our sovereign waters and would be subject for military intervention."

ice.52.t:0 "England offers a new deal"
ice.52.d:0 "English merchants delivered an ultimatum to our merchants earlier today. They landed at Reykjavik and demanded a meeting with the prominent traders of Iceland. They brought with them a document in which they pressed their claims over the waters, which entitled them to a sizeable portion of all profits from fish caught by Icelandic fishermen.

ice.53.b:0 "Organize an underground resistance"

ice.54.t:0 "Iceland rejects our demands"
ice.54.d:0 "With their rejection of our terms, we now have a justifiable excuse to land forces on their island. They have no military of any means and would have no means to resist us. Should we land a large force in a display of power, or use our resources elsewhere and deploy a smaller force?"

ice.57.t:0 "Operation Fork Foiled!"
ice.57.d:0 "We underestimated the tenacity of the Icelandic people. They were able to mount a sturdy defence with the aid of their Canadian allies and beat back our small landing parties into the sea. With this setback, we look like fools on the international scene with our failure to project power against a country as small as Iceland."

ice.60.t:0 "Defeat in the field"
ice.60.d:0 "We gambled everything we had on this one attempt to drive the English back. Despite our best efforts, the English simply kept coming and blew through our limited defenders.

ice.65.t:0 "The Icelandic Question"
ice.65.d:0 "With the failure of our ground forces, the navy has come forward to offer their support for a new operation. This would involve sailing the Rebecca right off the port of Reykjavik and sending bombers to target their infrastructure and harbour facilities to demonstrate what we are capable of. This would likely draw the ire of the international community. Our other option would be to back down out of the waters and hope that this debacle fades from memory."

ice.67.t:0 "Reykjavik bombed!"
ice.67.d:0 "Panic broke out overnight as the RNS Rebecca sailed up to the Reykjavik port and launched wave after wave of bombers. They struck with precision crippling what little infrastructure we have and the port facilities. Other waves dropped mass pamphlets that called for Iceland to adopt a policy of isolation in the Atlantic. It will take some time to rebuild this damage!"

#Union of Britain Tree Events#
ice.130.t:0 "Forming the new government"
ice.130.d:0 "Our alignment in the English sphere means we will need to create a new government for our island. Should this new government be lead by the People's Party or the Farmer's Party?"

ice.131.t:0 "Iceland requests to join the Phalanstere International"

ice.150.t:0 "The State of the Roads"
ice.150.d:0 "The infrastructure of Iceland has never been the top priority as most activities took place on the coast where the boat was the better form of transportation. As Iceland attempts to modernize, our backwards infrastructure really shows its age. What few roads that exist on the island are only seasonal and are in extremely poor condition."
ice.150.a:0 "We must do something about this"

ice.151.t:0 "Warm Water Piping"
ice.151.d:0 "A recent development in Iceland is the installation of warm water piping in certain parts of Reykjavik. Discovered when a farmer set a pipe to draw steam into his house a few years ago, the idea caught on quickly. Many schools and hospitals in the city were the first buildings to receive hot water pipes, but the pipe system has started to make its way into peoples homes now. Soon the whole city will be able to draw a hot bath with ease due to our abundant thermal springs beneath our island."
ice.151.a:0 "May a warm bath, warm our spirits"

#Generic Events#

ice.170.t:0 "Geysir Donation"
ice.170.d:0 "Iceland is home to several hot water geysers which have a tendency to draw crowds due to their beautifully explosive nature. Previously, this geyser was hidden away and used as a business venture to earn money from any who wished to watch the geyser erupt. Inspired by the charity of the nation, the owner has removed the fence and donated the geyser to the Icelandic people in perpetuity!"
ice.170.a:0 "A most generous donation"

ice.171.t:0 "Grand Opening of the Hydroelectric Plant"
ice.171.d:0 "Today marks the completion of the Laxárstöð Hydroelectric Plant. This singular plant has the capacity to quadruple our local power production on the island. May this new achievement help drive the recovery of our people and propel us to new and greater heights!"
ice.171.a:0 "To a brighter future!"

ice.172.t:0 "Hummock studies"
ice.172.d:0 "Scientists continue to study the effects that these grassy 'bumps' or hummocks have on the soil. Most experiments turn up with no meaningful results but people who have lived near these features describe a stronger feeling of well-being and claim that they fall ill with lesser frequency."
ice.172.a:0 "If it works, it works"

ice.173.t:0 "Farming Communities"
ice.173.d:0 "Small farming communities have started to be examined by government officials in search of ways that they could be managed better during these trying times. Communities who are performing well enough will be given a small tax exemption to encourage others to follow suit and run their farms more efficiently."
ice.173.a:0 "For efficiency!"

ice.174.t:0 "Packing the Barrels"
ice.174.d:0 "A crucial part of the export business is the packing of barrels of fish to be sent abroad and sold. We must invest in proper infrastructure to make sure that we don't run into any bottlenecks due to overcrowding on the docks."
ice.174.a:0 "Pack em' in and roll em' out"

ice.175.t:0 "A New Source of Power"
ice.175.d:0 "Engineers in Iceland have come forward with ideas to bring large amounts of power to the island to help with industrialization. The bountiful rivers and waterfalls carry an immense amount of energy that just passes us by. If we could create dams in some of our rivers, we might be able to harness Mother Nature's gift for our benefit."
ice.175.a:0 "An untapped spring"

ice.176.t:0 "Expansion of Vestmannaeyjar"
ice.176.d:0 "As the fishing industry grows, so too do the towns that support such businesses. While the harbour is too shallow for larger more modern vessels, the coastal town of Heimaey remains a crucial part of the cod fishing industry that is run off of the southern coast of Iceland. Already efforts are under way to streamline the transfer of catches from newer vessels to smaller ships that can bring the haul to the city for processing."
ice.176.a:0 "This can only grow busier"

ice.177.t:0 "A Modern Fleet"
ice.177.d:0 "The smaller ships that we have used in the past can not hope to handle the amount of fish that Iceland needs to recover from Black Monday. We must invest in larger vessels that are better suited for keeping up with the demands of the modern era."
ice.177.a:0 "Farewell old friend"

#Black Monday#
ice.200.t:0 "Black Monday strikes the Island!"
ice.200.d:0 "The economic collapse that originated in Germany has now reached the shores of Iceland. Our already tenuous hold over the economy has shattered and we have been left reeling. A total reorganization of Iceland will be needed to fix this crisis."
ice.200.a:0 "Catastrophe!"

#1937 Vote#
ice.250.t:0 "Plebiscite of 1937"
ice.250.d:0 "The time has come to vote over the continuation of Danish rule over Iceland. A generally ineffective response to helping the plight of the people of Iceland during the recent economic crisis has shaken the faith of the people in Danish rule. The cries for independence grow louder with every passing week. As the polls draw to a close, the results point to a desire"
ice.250.a:0 "For an independent Iceland!"
ice.250.b:0 "To remain in the Danish sphere!"

ice.251.t:0 "Independence Victory!"
ice.251.d:0 "With the recent victory of the vote for independence from Denmark, the althingi has been a rush with ministers declaring for one party or the other. The one constant is an upswing in the members who are a part of the Independence Party coalition."
ice.251.a:0 "To more prosperous times!"

ice.252.t:0 "Loyalty to Denmark"
ice.252.d:0 "No matter the economic crisis that has polarized many on the isle, Icelanders are not a rebellious people. We will do our part as a constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark to care for our corner of the realm without cutting ties with the rest. This has unfortunately had the effect of radicalizing part of the hardline independence wing."
ice.252.a:0 "We must remain a beacon of calm."

#Leaving Mitteleuropa#
ice.253.t:0 "Iceland leaves Mitteleuropa"
ice.253.d:0 "With our latest extension of freedom from Denmark, we are free to forge our own way separate from the ailing Mitteleuropan economic bloc. Some merchants are apprehensive towards our uncertain future but are hopeful to find more lucrative deals."
ice.253.a:0 "To a freer market!"

ice.254.t:0 "Iceland leaves Mitteleuropa"
ice.254.d:0 "The people of Iceland have elected to leave the Mitteleuropan sphere and attempt to forge a new web of independent trade. This could be an opportunity for us to find an ally closer to the home isles."
ice.254.a:0 "Interesting"

ice.255.t:0 "Iceland leaves Mitteleuropa"
ice.255.d:0 "The people of Iceland have elected to leave the Mitteleuropan sphere and attempt to forge a new web of independent trade. This could be an opportunity for us to find an ally closer to the royalists in exile."
ice.255.a:0 "Interesting"

ice.256.t:0 "Iceland Elects to End Their Personal Union"
ice.256.d:0 "After the Weltkrieg, in 1921, Iceland, at the time fully part of Denmark was given its independence, under personal union with Denmark and with Denmark taking care of Iceland's foreign policy until possible revision by plebiscite in 1946, 25 years after Iceland's independence. As such, they came along into Mitteleuropa and they remained in general in a course with us. However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years. Under the dissent that this caused, Icelandic politicians had expedited the referendum, and the Icelandic people elected to end our relationship. A republic will be declared in Reykjavik and Iceland has let us know that they no longer need our foreign ministry to treat Icelanders as if they were Danes."
ice.256.a:0 "So be it"

ice.257.t:0 "Iceland Elects to Remain in Their Personal Union"
ice.257.d:0 "After the Weltkrieg, in 1921, Iceland, at the time fully part of Denmark was given its independence, under personal union with Denmark and with Denmark taking care of Iceland's foreign policy until possible revision by plebiscite in 1946, 25 years after Iceland's independence. As such, they came along into Mitteleuropa and they remained in general in a course with us. However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years. Under the dissent that this caused, Icelandic politicians had expedited the referendum, but the Icelandic people elected to maintain our relationship. Iceland shall thus remain in our sphere for the coming years."
ice.257.a:0 "Ah, splendid"

ice.258.t:0 "Jon Baldvinsson Retires from Office"
ice.258.d:0 "A popular member of the Althingi and leader of the Social Democrat Party has recently announced his plans to step away from office. Citing his failing health, he has decided to pass the torch on to Stefan Stefansson to continue to lead the Social Democrat Party."
ice.258.a:0 "We wish him the best"

ice.300.t:0 "Restructuring the Banks"
ice.300.d:0 "The current situation in Iceland does not suit anyone as the banking system has completely failed following the disaster of Black Monday. Two camps have formed which argue too separate views for how the banks should be rebuilt. One group believes that the only way forward is through a strong centrally planned bank, while the other argues that a series of separate specialized banks are how the people of Iceland will recover best from this crisis. Which group should we endorse?"
ice.300.a:0 "One Island, One Bank!"

ice.301.t:0 "Purchasing a New Design"
ice.301.d:0 "Our current ships are ill-suited for the modern market. As we seek to improve, we must contact our Nordic neighbours and request a purchase of some of their latest designs. Who should we conduct business with?"

ice.301.b:0 "Deal with Denmark"
ice.301.c:0 "Neighbour Norway"

ice.350.t:0 "Iceland Getting Rebellious"
ice.350.d:0 "Our forces on Iceland have intercepted a radio signal broadcasting to the locals in an attempt to antagonize their view of us. We know that they lack the means to drive us off the island so should we let them talk or shall we bulk up our forces slightly?"
ice.350.a:0 "Authorize an additional force"
ice.350.b:0 "What could they do?"

ice.351.t:0 "The Future of Iceland in the Entente"
ice.351.d:0 "With the victory of Canada and the Entente navy during the Cod Wars, our Iceland now finds itself no longer adrift - now tethered to the whims of Ottawa and the Anglos. With this new status quos, and with our people now free from Copenhagen, the Canadian government has moved to ‘aid’ us in reorganizing our government. A new head of state shall rise, but who that being shall be is up for debate. Thor Thors, a long-standing fixture of the domestic Icelandic political scene and one of the most powerful men on the island, is a popular candidate. Under this conservative lawyer, Iceland shall rise as a republic within the Entente. However, with the backing of these new allies, support for a domestic Icelandic monarchy has also cropped up. The two main figures put forth as possible monarchs are the Canadian King [CAN.getleader], and the granddaughter of the late King Edward VII - Princess Alexandra Victoria Alberta Edwina Louise Duff. With these two proud and loyal Anglos also having their supporters, the future of Iceland truly is up in the air, but one thing is for certain: the Entente’s grasp around the small Icelandic archipelago has been sealed."
ice.351.a:0 "Princess Alexandra shall be the first Queen of Iceland!"
ice.351.b:0 "The Anglo King shall take the throne."
ice.351.c:0 "Thor Thors shall be the liaison between Ottawa and the Icelandic people."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_CHARLES_MARX_DESC:0 "The face of the Luxembourgish Left and the father of Luxembourgish Syndicalism, Louis Charles Marx is one of the most respected, and reviled, men in the nation. Boring in 1903, Marx lived through the Weltkrieg and the fiery revolutions that followed while just a boy, taking in these sights that would set him on the path of radicalism for life. Training to become a doctor as an intern in Paris in secret, Marx showed promise as a surgeon and doctor but dreamed of political aspirations. After completing his medical studies, Marx snuck back across the border into now-German occupied Luxembourg, and returned to the capital full of both medical knowledge and Syndicalist ideas he had not had before his departure. While back at home, and with secret funding from the French, Marx founded his own private medical practice that served as a front for his ‘Armée Secrète’ - a anti-German resistance movement aimed at instigating a wider Luxembourger revolution - and secretly used it to spread Syndicalist ideas within his homeland. With the spark of the revolution finally taking place with the arrival of French general Henri Tanguy, the two set to work liberating Luxembourg, and after many hard fought victories and a gruesome guerilla campaign, have freed Luxembourg from the Kaiserreich’s grasp. Now, with the German occupation uprooted - only to be replaced by a French one - Marx finds himself as the main figure within the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress, and has been elected as its first president. Under his leadership, Luxembourg shall gradually face its new Syndicalist destiny, despite the numerous reactionary groups that infect our state, and Marx shall be the herald of this new crimson dawn."
POLITICS_RASQUIN_DESC:0 "The head of the Grand Coalition and a unifying figure among the moderate Socialists and liberals still left within the nation, Michel Rasquin is one of the only leftists within our new government respected by the non-Socialist masses. Born in 1899, Rasquin studied to become a journalist from a young age, and during his schooling and time spent reporting on the French and British revolutions he would slowly begin to radicalize and drift towards the Left. Denying the extremist views of his colleagues, Rasquin has organized a great and varied coalition of Social Democrats, Democratic Socialists, Anarchists, Radical Liberals, and other moderate or fringe groups, using his ties made while being a resistance commander during the Second Weltkrieg and during our revolution to further expand his support base. With this wave of popular support behind him, Rasquin was elected by the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress to become our first president, and now seeks to drive Luxembourg into the pink embrace of anti-radicalism and moderate Democratic Socialism."
POLITICS_URBANY_DESC:0 "Serving admirably as a rebel leader during our resistance struggle and during the Luxembourger Revolution, Dominique Urbany has secured enough support to be elected as the first president of our Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress. Born in 1903 and studying to be a journalist while drifting between numerous different Social Democratic and moderate Socialist organizations, Urbany broke from moderatism at a young age seeing the success of the French and British revolutions, and has since been primarily influenced by the Jacobins and the Internationalist school of Socialist thought; even proclaiming himself an open ‘Trotskyite’ despite the failures and general resentment Trotsky himself has racked up over the years. Calling for World Revolution and European unification, Urbany seeks for Luxembourg to be the center of this new shared destiny. Rising to prominence during his time leading the Young Totalist League - a far-Left paramilitary active during the war - Urbany has secured much needed support from his allies, and now pushes for Luxembourg to herald in the world’s new crimson dawn."
POLITICS_CHARLOTTE_DESC:0 "Standing as one of the only women in the world with her level of status, power, and influence, Grand Duchess Charlotte Adelgonde Élise of Nassau-Weilburg is the true and rightful sovereign of the restored Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Born in 1896 in Berg Castle, Charlotte was the second daughter of Grand Duke William IV, meaning it was her older sister Marie-Adélaïde who originally took the throne following the death of their father in 1912. As Marie-Adélaïde guided the nation through an untold era of peace and prosperity with modernization and Germanization programs, Charlotte spent her time building diplomatic ties and enjoying royal life. Unlike her sister who was fiercely pro-German and who enjoyed messing about in national affairs, Charlotte was far more reserved and apolitical, but still rose to take her rightful seat on the throne when the nation called upon her in their time of need. Taking the throne hastily after her sister’s death at the hands of Commune soldiers, Charlotte would only rule for a short while before the Grand Duchy was fully dissolved by the victorious French. Following these crushing French victories and the arrival of the Luxembourger Revolution, Charlotte was forced to flee and established a government-in-exile supported by monarchist loyalists, republicans under Pierre Dupong, and nationalist paramilitaries under Damian Kratzenberg. With their help, the counter-revolution would eventually be successful, and in the ensuing power struggle, it was the Grand Duchess who would come out on top. Now once again ruling from the Luxembourg throne, Charlotte has restored the fallen Grand Duchy, and seeks to restore Luxembourg to all its former glory."
POLITICS_KRATZENBERG_DESC:0 "Once just a mere highschool teacher and literary critic, Damian Kratzenberg now rules over Luxembourg as its Germanic savior. Born in 1878 as the son of German immigrants in Clervaux, Kratzenberg was influenced by Germanic culture from a young age. After receiving higher education at the Diekirch Gymnasium, Kratzenberg went on to study literature and art in Luxembourg City, Paris, Lille and Berlin throughout the early 1900s, learning numerous languages such as German, French, Dutch, and Greek along the way. Rising to teach at the famous Athénée de Luxembourg, Kratzenberg joined the Liberal Liga in 1927 and slowly radicalized as the threat of the Commune loomed closer. By 1935, Kratzenberg had fully departed from his once-liberal views, and instead rose to become president of the Society for German Literature and Art - a pro-German cultural society that would serve as the foundation for the Volksdeutsche Bewegung wich he would found just a few years later. From here, Kratzenberg would further radicalize, falling in ideas of German nationalism and purity inspired by burgeoning nationalist movements within the Kaiserreich itself. Leading the VdB from its humble beginnings, Kratzenberg and his followers fought viscously in the counter-revolution to free Luxembourg, with his paramilitary arm of the VdB proving to be instrumental in the liberation. Now, with our nation under his thumb and in the process of being totally ‘Germanized,’ Damian Kratzenberg stands as the most powerful man in Luxembourg. Under his watch, we shall attain our Teutonic destiny!"
POLITICS_TANGUY_DESC:0 "Serving as one of the most decorated young Revolutionary generals within the Commune’s larger armed forces, Henri Tanguy is both a veteran of the Second Weltkrieg as well as one of the leading figures of the ‘Résistance Luxembourgeoise.’ Born in 1908 in Brittany to sailors, the young Tanguy moved to Paris as a boy following the Weltkierg to become a foundryman, where he would fall in with various far-left groups such as the Young Communists following the rise of the new French Revolution until he joined the Commune’s military in 1929. From there, Tanguy rose through the ranks, slowly proving himself as an officer, until he eventually joined a special unit known as Francs-Tireurs et Partisans aimed at inciting rebellion within the territories occupied by the Kaiserreich. Within the FTP, Tanguy worked closely with Luxembourgish Socialists and Social Democrats waging a guerilla war against the pro-monarchy and reactionary forces that long occupied Luxembourg, and helped lead the ragtag group of freedom fighters to victory after victory until Luxembourg was finally freed. Now, in the wake of the Second Weltkrieg, General Tanguy leads the ‘Armée de Libération du Luxembourg’ - a provisional military government aimed at aiding the creation of Luxembourg's own people’s republic. Though his mandate is only temporary, Tanguy truly seeks to help the Luxemourgers build their new nation, and it is his duty to ensure this infantile red republic can blossom before it is taken down by reactionaries still hiding out in Luxembourg. So long as Tanguy and his Armée de Libération are in Luxembourg, the new administration is safe."
POLITICS_MARIE_ADELAIDE_DESC:0 "Once the ruling Grand Duchess following her father’s death in 1912 and before the rise of her sister, Marie-Adélaïde Thérèse Hilda Wilhelmine of Nassau-Weilburg has been restored to the empty throne by the Volksdeausche Bewegung to serve as a puppeted monarch for legitimacy and prestige among our own people and with the Kaiserreich. Born in 1894 at Berg Castle and thought to be murdered at the start of the Second Weltkrieg after French Soldiers ambushed her convoy, it was revealed she was kidnapped by the French and kept locked away in a Paris prison camp. After a German bombing raid blew a hole in the exterior wall of the camp, Marie-Adélaïde was able to slowly make her way home, where VdB officers rescued her. Now recrowned as the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, Marie-Adélaïde’s pro-German reputation can finally be put to good use. Though she is entirely powerless and only serves as a national figurehead, she is beloved by the German-speaking and pro-Berlin populations, and should serve as the perfect figurehead for our new Luxemburg."

LUX_fn_hre:0 "Restore the Holy Roman Empire"
LUX_fn_hre_desc:0 "With the lands of Germany under our control, we are in a prime position to restore an archaic and noble idyll. As if 1806 never occurred, the ‘First Reich’ of the Germanic peoples shall once again see the light of day. This ‘Neit Hellege Réimesche Räich’ - or New Holy Roman Empire - shall learn from the mistakes of its predecessors as we, the Luxembourgish people, guide our Teutonic kin to greatness!"

LUX_industry_cat:0 "A New Luxembourgish Industrial Revolution"
LUX_industry_cat_desc:0 "Once the industrial jewel of the Low Countries, Luxembourg has been ravaged by both war and revolution, and our once-famous and booming industry shows these scars and wounds well. We must respark our passion for innovation and industrial success so that we may rebuild our powerful economic reputation and bring prosperity to all Luxembourgers!"

LUX_develop_wine_industry:0 "Adapt the Moselle Vineyards"
LUX_develop_wine_industry_desc:0 "Luxembourg's vineyards once relied heavily on German wineries along the Rhine, but the Weltkrieg has heavily disrupted this long standing cooperation and as a result, Luxembourgish viniculture has begun to wither like the vines in our vineyards. Thus, Elbling and other low-quality types of wine must be sidelined so that we can fully focus on only growing and brewing quality variants that are sure to sell. \nAdditionally, most of Luxembourg's wine sources water from the Moselle River, which is kited over to Rhineland wineries along with our grapes and mixed there. Now that France has interrupted this process, our own Moselle vineyards must be shrunk down so that we can focus on growing more quality crops over absolute quantity, while we also strive to build our own domestic distilleries on our own soil so that local viniculture can prosper and thrive without being hampered by the ravaged German industry."
LUX_develop_steel_industry:0 "Restaff the Belval Steelworks"
LUX_develop_steel_industry_desc:0 "The Belval Steel Works comprises the centre of Luxembourgish steel manufacturing, which itself stands as one the largest pillars of our economy. As the Weltkriegs wrath nearly ruined Luxembourg and much of our industry with it, the Belval Steelworks' production centers were halted and put under French military control. Now that Luxembourg has asserted itself on the world stage and cast off both German and French suzerainty, the Belval Steelworks needs to be repaired and put back in business.
LUX_develop_chemical_industry:0 "Domestic Chemical Industry and Synthetic Experiments"
LUX_develop_chemical_industry_desc:0 "Pulling expertise from the minds at Solvay and from other international sources, we shall break ground on a new chemical production plan in the industrial heart of Arlon. This new compound shall be the main center for chemical production and research, as well as the site of our new synthetic R&D department, which will seek to emulate the synthetic rubber production seen in France and Germany."
LUX_develop_arms_industry:0 "Found the National Arméi vu Lëtzebuerg"
LUX_develop_arms_industry_desc:0 "In order to create our own domestic arms industry, our regime has proposed the creation of a new national armoury to stand as a new weapons stockpile as well as the foundation of our own native gunsmithing industry. By pulling designs from France, Germany, and the Low Countries, the newly created ‘National Arméi vu Lëtzebuerg’ shall be the cornerstone of our new militarization push. Hopefully this one won’t blow up like the last one did in 1807."
LUX_develop_infrastructure:0 "Create the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois"
LUX_develop_infrastructure_desc:0 "In an attempt to increase the efficiency and standard of our nation’s various railways and heavy infrastructure, our regime has announced their plan to create the ‘Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois,’ or the Luxembourg National Railway Company. The CFL shall be created from the nationalized remains of our previously privately-owned rail system which has fallen into decay and corruption - especially in the wake of the Weltkrieg. With the CFL fully in charge of Luxembourg’s rails, hopefully now the trains will run on time."
LUX_develop_building:0 "Rural Development Schemes and Urbanization"
LUX_develop_building_desc:0 "In order to match our ambitious plans for economic repair, revival, and innovation, a new development scheme has been drafted by our leading economists and land surveyors. On their advice, we shall move to modernize the rural areas of Luxembourg with new sewage systems, infrastructure, telecommunications, and electrification campaigns while we simultaneously move to expand the great cities of Luxembourg in order to accommodate our growing population and their needs. Both our peasants and our urbanites shall feel the effects of our new plans, for no Luxembourger gets left behind!"

LUX_military_cat:0 "Expanding the Lëtzebuerger Arméi"
LUX_military_cat:0 "Originally getting its start as a militia under Grand Duke William I in 1817, our national armed forces have come a long way from their humble beginnings. However, much of our military is still unprofessional and under equipped, and not to mention greatly understaffed. We must address these ills and reforge the Lëtzebuerger Arméi into the pride of the nation!"

LUX_refugee_influx:0 "Allow Refugees to Volunteer"
LUX_refugee_influx_desc:0 "Our nation has seen a great influx of refugees, primarily due to the nature of war and our nation’s location smack dab between competing world powers. However, what brings chaos also brings opportunity, for now there are many desperate people within the nation with no food, no home, no job, and no prospects. We shall offer a hand to these downtrodden souls through a simple exchange - come fight for the Lëtzebuerger Arméi, and all of your needs shall be taken care of."
LUX_recruit_unit:0 "Request Reinforcements from the Lëtzebuerger Gendarmerie"
LUX_recruit_unit_desc:0 "The Lëtzebuerger Gendarmerie is our local and loyal police force, bringing peace, security, and safety to all Luxemborugers. The training they receive however is quite similar to the training our own armed forces go through, and with our current lack of manpower, perhaps these peacekeepers can be useful. Every so often, if their numbers can allow it, we shall be able to requisition one of their veteran units for our own purposes and ambitions."
LUX_seize_weapons:0 "International Arms Purchases"
LUX_seize_weapons_desc:0 "Though we have begun to build a domestic gunsmithing and weapons manufacturing industry, it is still not enough to arm every soldier in the nation. We must reach out to our international contacts - whether they be white and open markets from our allies or from black markets like those run by the Senussi order or the ‘Ndrangheta and La Cosa Nostra - in order to sequester the necessary arms needed to protect Luxembourg."

### Ideas ###
LUX_destroyed_national_identity:0 "Decimated National Identity"
LUX_destroyed_national_identity_desc:0 "After decades under German rule and now with the French occupation, the clarity of the Luxembourgish national identity is at an all time low since the birth of our national conscience. We must work to undo this nationalist corrosion of our own domestic culture, lest we simply melt away into the wider identity of our occupiers."
LUX_destroyed_national_identity2:0 "Recovering National Identity"
LUX_destroyed_national_identity2_desc:0 "With our initial efforts to restore our national identity going well, our people are once again taking pride in calling themselves Luxembourgers. Though we still have a long way to go before our culture is truly healed, at least we are no longer just Frenchmen or Germans with a different language."
LUX_destroyed_national_identity3:0 "Blossoming National Identity"
LUX_destroyed_national_identity3_desc:0 "As Luxembourgish nationalism only continues to spread like wildfire, it would seem that our culture has been ushered into a new renaissance. Though dangerous nationalist elements have once again begun to spread, they can be kept easily in check by the overwhelming tide of ‘positive’ nationalism espoused by our less radical citizens. Though we are not out of the woods yet, it would seem that not only is our national identity no longer destined for extinction - on the contrary, it would seem that we are on the brink of a new cultural golden age!"

LUX_language_question:0 "Language Question"
LUX_language_question_desc:0 "Following the Weltkrieg and our annexation into the Kaiserreich through referendum in 1919, German was made a second national language alongside our native tongue of Luxembourgish. Following the arrival of the French Occupation however, German was removed as a national language with French rising to take its place. This linguistic gymnastic has only stoked ethnic tensions within the nation while alleviating next to nothing. We must figure out a final solution to this language question, lest it rip our nation apart."

LUX_resistance:0 "Resistance to Ducal Restoration"
LUX_resistance_desc:0 "Though the Grand Duchess rightfully rules Luxembourg by birthright and by grace of God, many within our newly restored Grand Duchy resist this claim and this revival. These violent fools must be shown the glory of our Grand Duchess and the righteousness of our restorative movement. They will be forced to see the truth - that the Grand Duchy is good for all Luxembourgers, whether they know it or not!"

### Focuses ###
LUX_frog_occupation:0 "French Occupation"
LUX_frog_occupation_desc:0 "With their victories on the Western Front, the French Syndicalists have come to ‘liberate’ our beautiful nation from so-called ‘corrupt and reactionary’ German rule. Despite our nation’s democratic decision following the Weltkrieg to join the Kaiserreich, it would seem that we have been robbed of this mandate, and now find ourselves autonomous but occupied under Paris. With the arrival of General Henri Tanguy, ‘Déi Lénk’ has risen to national prominence, and it would seem that Luxembourg - whether the masses like it or not - will soon be a Socialist nation."
LUX_drive_out_german_influence:0 "Drive Out German Influence"
LUX_drive_out_german_influence_desc:0 "With the arrival of the Internationale occupation, our new allies have seen it fit to remove all German influence within Luxembourg. Given our long-held ties to the Kaiserreich and the degree of Germanification our culture and society have undergone, this shall be no small feat. Our new benefactors must be careful how far and how fast they push, however, for even now the wolves circle their new government."
LUX_re_establish_identity:0 "Re-Establish a National Identity"
LUX_re_establish_identity_desc:0 "What it means to be a pure and independent Luxembourger has been muddied, for we have been tied to Berlin and the Rheinish Germans for quite some time. Our provisional government has moved to revive the Luxembourgish identity, bolstered now by social nationalist and civic nationalist ideas from Paris. We shall take back what it means to be a Luxembourger!"
LUX_new_nation_new_politics:0 "New Nation, New Politics"
LUX_new_nation_new_politics_desc:0 "The Luxembourg that stands ‘independent’ today is a far-cry from its past self. With the monarchy deposed and with the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress now in temporary command, our nation has been radically changed - for better or for worse. Now it is up to the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vun Lëtzebuerg to decide the fate of our newly crimson state."

LUX_soc_victory:0 "Luxembourg’s Crimson Dawn"
LUX_soc_victory_desc:0 "With guidance from General Tanguy and his attache from Paris, the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vun Lëtzebuerg has heralded a new destiny for Luxembourg. A new people’s republic has been founded over the ashes of the old Duchy, and now our new state is ready to tackle the rigors of state-craft. Soon, Tanguy and his men will be a distant memory as we take our first independent steps into this new wide and Red world. As our first elections are prepared, we begin to take our new destiny in stride!"

LUX_synd:0 "Marx’s SPL"
LUX_synd_desc:0 "Following tense elections within the Kongress, Louis Charles Marx has been elected as the first President of our red republic. Serving as the face of ‘Déi Lénk’ and as the most widely respected Socialist in the nation, Marx was the favorite to win. Now as leader of our nation, Marx shall guide both the Syndikalist Partei vu Lëtzebuerg and the wider country as a whole on the long road to achieving true Syndicalism."
LUX_trade_unions:0 "Towards Syndicalism Through Unionism"
LUX_trade_unions_desc:0 "In order to rally the people and prepare them for true Syndicalism, we will have to dip their toes in it first. By expanding unions to every industry in the nation, and by making them voluntary at first, we shall slowly raise membership through honest practices and tempting incentives as we seek to fully unionize the nation. Only through total unionization can our nation be truly free, democratic, and equal."
LUX_german_compromise:0 "Language Compromise"
LUX_german_compromise_desc:0 "Until our integration into Germany, the only national language was Luxembourgish. However, with our admittance into the Kaiserreich, German rose to be a national language as well, only to be replaced by French with the rise of our revolution. Though all three languages have long been used in Luxembourg, it has always been a point of tension, but Marx has seen a solution. By allowing all three languages to hold equal status within the nation, we shall appease everyone at once, placing us on track to reduce ethnic tensions across the nation."
LUX_national_medical_system:0 "Win Over the Masses with Healthcare"
LUX_national_medical_system_desc:0 "Syndicalism still stands as a foreign and feared movement to many within the nation, even among our Leftist allies. Fearing complete societal reorganization and bloody redistributions, the masses need to be put at ease for now until we are in a position to pursue our more radical goals. With the war leaving many sick and wounded, it would be ideal to create a national healthcare service to provide free medical care to all citizens of our republic. By using this program as a goodwill tool, we shall win over the citizenry through medicine and bandages while we slowly reform society around them."

LUX_internationale_tourist_hub:0 "The Tourist Trap of the Internationale"
LUX_internationale_tourist_hub_desc:0 "Luxembourg is the new crimson pearl of Western Europe - a beautiful slice of the Old World that has long stood as a popular tourist destination. With the famous wineries, castles, and natural scenery of our nation now beyond the Red Curtain, it would be wise to advertise them to the rest of the Internationale. We shall become the tourist trap of the proletariat, and use this drummed-up business to bolster our economy."
LUX_nationalize_wine_industry:0 "Nationalize the Wine Industry"
LUX_nationalize_wine_industry_desc:0 "Luxembourg is famous for its rich, fertile soil and immense mineral wealth for such a small nation, but none of our produce is as famous as Luxembourger wine. By collectivizing and nationalizing the vineyards and wineries across the nation and putting them under governmental supervision, we shall increase the output of these historic establishments while bringing the profits to the people. All mouths in the Internationale shall be able to taste our exquisite wine, no matter their standing!"

LUX_radsoc:0 "Rasquin’s LSAP"
LUX_radsoc_desc:0 "Maneuvering past his political rivals, Michel Rasquin and his Lëtzebuerger Sozialistesch Aarbechterpartei has won the first post-revolutionary elections. Standing as a coalition of various moderate and fringe Socialists, Social Democrats, and Democratic Socialists, LSAP preaches for slow, steady, and purely democratic reform to bring true Socialism to Luxembourg. With Rasquin being sworn in and with his coalition behind him, the nation shall soon bear witness to his radically progressive ideals."
LUX_national_coalition_govt:0 "Bolster the Grand Coalition"
LUX_national_coalition_govt_desc:0 "Rasquin’s electoral, and now professional, success relies entirely on the Grand Coalition. Already containing everything from Anarchists to Social Democrats, Rasquin seeks to take this a step farther for the good of all Luxembourgers. By offering an olive branch to any and all republican and democratic elements within the nation that agrees to renouncing any and all ties with Germany, Rasquin hopes to win-over a large enough portion of the political scene to no longer need to worry about factionalism or reactionary tendencies. With many progressive and liberal politicians already stepping forward to join this enlarged big-tent group, it is sure to ensure political stability for years to come."
LUX_language_unity:0 "Unity Through Language"
LUX_language_unity_desc:0 "Eschewing ideas of bias and non-conformity, Rasquin’s LSAP has proposed a new bill to finally solve the language issue. Until our integration into Germany, the only national language was Luxembourgish, with German later rising to be another national language with our annexation, only to then be replaced by French with the rise of our revolution. This has caused a great deal of ethnic and cultural tension within the nation, and to solve it, Rasquin has decided to return to the old status quo. Soon, only Luxembourgish will be the accepted national language once again. With this one and united language, we shall forcibly make our nation one and united as well, for the good of all Luxembourgers."
LUX_working_class_identity:0 "Uplift the Working Class Hero"
LUX_working_class_identity_desc:0 "The common man is the backbone of our nation. On their shoulders, our revolution was carried to victory, and in their hands, our new destiny lies. We should all aspire to be like these heroes of Luxembourg, for each and every single one of them - from the simple labourers and factory workers to the industrious miners and refinerymen - contribute to the heart and soul of our new people’s republic. The new Luxembourgish man shall model themselves in the image of these simple heroes as we craft our culture into one fitting for the noble peasants and and wondrous workers we now aspire to be."

LUX_tot:0 "Urbany’s RSP"
LUX_tot_desc:0 "Astounding many, the self-called ‘Trotskyist’ and Internationalist Dominique Urbany has come out on top in the Kongress, and now leads Luxembourg with his Revolutionär Sozialistesch Partei. Under the RSP and Urbany, Luxembourg shall now be painted a deep crimson as Urbany drives the nation towards Internationalist Maximism based upon the Totalist Charter and the ideas of Tukhachevsky and Trotsky. With Urbany at the helm, Luxembourg shall play its part in the World Revolution, but until then, our focus should be on building up Totalism in one nation first - our nation."
LUX_planned_cities:0 "Plan Out Our Utopia"
LUX_planned_cities_desc:0 "Seeking to improve quality of life and efficiency, a new urban development plan has been drafted by Urbany and his associates in the RSP. This new plan, called ‘,’ seeks to link the twelve noble cities of Luxembourg into one massive urban sprawl. The idea calls for Luxembourg itself to be consumed by a concrete jungle with Luxembourg City at its core, built in modernist and futurist styles borrowed from the Internationale, linked together with cutting-edge mass transit systems, and dotted with cultural and natural sites to preserve beauty and function. This new plan will possibly take decades to complete, but like all great projects, you have to break ground sometime, so why not now?!"
LUX_ban_germ_language:0 "Fierce Anti-Germanism"
LUX_ban_germ_language_desc:0 "Reviling anything Germanic or Teutonic in origin, Urbany and his RSP have virtually declared war on ‘Germanism.’ Outlawing their language, their literature, their films, their art, their cuisine, and anything else having to do with that damnable nation, Urbany’s regime will stop at nothing to completely de-Germanize Luxembourg. With anti-German crimes and assaults becoming common, and even endorsed by the state, Luxembourg will give over fully to its nationalist and pro-French ties, replacing all sources of German influence with either Luxembourgish or French sources instead."
LUX_internationalism:0 "Beacon of the Word Revolution"
LUX_internationalism_desc:0 "Following Urbany’s initial successes at bringing Totalism to Luxembourg, he has moved to proclaim the World Revolution. Calling upon all Socialist movements across the world to rise up and break their chains together, Urbany has begun to set up Luxembourg to be the beacon of this new world. Though many do not seem keen on answering the call, even with our own nation, Urbany has carried on regardless, and has begun making plans for Luxembourg to take on the world if it must if that means the Dictatorship of the Totalist Proletariat can finally be established. Totalists of the world, unite!"

LUX_countercoup:0 "The Luxembourgish Counter-Revolution"
LUX_countercoup_desc:0 "Fighting tooth and nail against the Socialist regime and their Internationale backers, we have come out victorious. Luxembourg has been saved by the hands of our coalition, and now a new, redless sun dawns on our freed nation. With the coalition that saved our country from Socialism already splintering apart, we once more stand at a crossroads. However, with our spirits high, we shall march into this new unknown dutifully, for we have a new nation to build, and we mustn't dawdle!"

LUX_monarchy_restored:0 "Revival of the Grand Duchy"
LUX_monarchy_restored_desc:0 "Taking her rightful throne, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Adelgonde Élise of Nassau-Weilburg now rules over the restored Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. With the nation licking its wounds in the wake of both the French Occupation and the counter-revolution, it is up to the Grand Duchess to guide the country and our people out of this mire and towards a brighter future. Now is no longer the time to sit about and wallow in the ashes of our old order. Now is the time to rebuild, to reconquer, and to reaffirm what it means to be a Luxembourger!"
LUX_constitutional_monarchy:0 "A Constitutional Duchy"
LUX_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "Choosing to heed her Republican allies, the Grand Duchess has agreed to cede some of her power to a parliamentary system, allowing democracy to once again take hold in Luxembourg. With democratic parties already reforming and with elections already planned, it is only a matter of time now before the jewel that was our old democracy is fully restored!"
LUX_master_of_diplomacy:0 "Master of Diplomacy"
LUX_master_of_diplomacy_desc:0 "Loving matters of diplomacy far more than politics or ideology, the Grand Duchess Charlotte has moved forward with her plan to create a new diplomatic corp for the state tied directly to the Crown. This organization, led by Charlotte herself, shall work to establish diplomatic ties with foreign dignitaries and officials from around the globe in order to find allies, economic partnerships, and other ‘friends’ to help ensure our survival. Luxembourg cannot be left out in the cold without backup again, and Charlotte’s charm and grace shall be our ticket there."
LUX_auth_monarchy:0 "An Absolute Duchy"
LUX_auth_monarchy_desc:0 "Eschewing calls for democracy and ignoring her republican allies, Grand Duchess Charlotte has decided to keep all powers of the executive for herself and the Crown, effectively creating an absolute monarchy within the Duchy. With all power now in her hands, the Grand Duchess has risen to become one of the last true absolutists left. Guided by her steady hand, strong will, and sharp wit, the Grand Duchy shall ride forth into its new destiny with gusto as hundreds of years of tradition carry us forth!"
LUX_Maulkuerfgesetz_law:0 "Nei Maulkuerfgesetz"
LUX_Maulkuerfgesetz_law_desc:0 "In order to crack down on any radical Leftist elements left within the nation, a new antisocialist law has been proposed. Named the New Muzzle Law, or Nei Maulkuerfgesetz, this bill is a repeat of the anti-Socialists bill passed in the wake of rising Socialist influence during the interwar, and is aimed at the defense of political and social order within Luxembourg over all other pursuits. Effectively banning all Socialist action - whether it be party organization, assembly, newspaper printing, or anything else - Luxembourg will be cleansed of Syndicalists one way or another, for any of those who are foolish enough to not obey the law shall simply be arrested or conveniently ‘disappeared.’"
LUX_ducal_restoration:0 "Complete Ducal Restoration"
LUX_ducal_restoration_desc:0 "With the minutiae and specifics now sorted through, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is to be officially and totally restored in all of its former glory. Grand Duchess Charlotte is to be ‘re-crowned’ in an opulent ceremony for all the nation to bear witness to, serving as a metaphorical ‘new’ beginning for the Duchy. With this ceremony, our new destiny shall begin in earnest, and we shall take on the future with our restored suzerin above us to guide our path along the way."
LUX_church_backing:0 "Allies in the Church"
LUX_church_backing_desc:0 "Luxembourg has long, deep ties to the Catholic Church, with over 90% of the nation following the faith, though the degree of their piety of course varies quite a lot. Regardless, we are a proudly Catholic nation, guided by a Catholic monarch that upholds Catholic values. It is a no-brainer that we should move to align more closely with the Church, both here in Luxembourg and in Rome. With support from our fellow Catholics, our restored Duchy will never falter to sin, hedonism, and debauchery ever again!"
LUX_encourage_tourism:0 "Encourage Foreign Tourism"
LUX_encourage_tourism_desc:0 "Long has Luxembourg been a popular tourist destination, with German nobles having used our quaint patch of verdant land to relax and unwind as far back as the times of the Holy Roman Empire. We should respark this foreign interest in our nation, and move to revitalize the tourist industry that once boomed here. By hyping up our rich heritage and showcasing ourselves as one of the last slices of Old Europe, we shall ride to new prosperity atop a wave of foreigners seeking to take in our nation’s beauty and culture."
LUX_new_banking:0 "The Heart of European Banking"
LUX_new_banking_desc:0 "Alongside the infamous alpine nation to the South, Luxembourg has long stood as one of the main centers of European banking for centuries. However, after two revolutions and two world wars, we are in a sore spot. We must revitalize our financial industry, reopen our banks to foreign investment and dealings, and re-mark Luxembourg on the maps of the world denoting that we are once again open for all your banking needs! With their capital, we too shall grow rich."
LUX_new_aristocracy:0 "Restore the Luxembourgish Aristocracy"
LUX_new_aristocracy_desc:0 "With much of our nobility being killed in the revolutions or having fled the nation, never to return, our newly restored Duchy finds itself sorely lacking when it comes to bluebloods to accompany the Grand Duchess. To alleviate this, empty titles shall be given to new families who proved themselves in the counter-revolution as being loyal allies to the Crown. These heroes shall be treated as such, and given the recognition and rewards they so rightfully deserve. Though many come from lowly blood, that shall soon change as their blood is elevated as they are granted these titles. Besides, after a few generations of inbreeding and intermingling with the other royals of Europe, it will be impossible to tell otherwise."

LUX_natpop_coup:0 "A Luxemburg for the Germanic Race"
LUX_natpop_coup_desc:0 "The vile Socialists tried to rob us of our proud Germanic legacy, but we were able to crush them handily by utilizing our warrior’s spirit and by channeling our Teutonic heritage. Now, with the Syndicalists dead or imprisoned, the Volksdeutsche Bewegung under Damian Kratzenberg shall purge Luxembourg of all non-Germanic elements. There is no room for ‘French-ness’ or any other impurities in this new Luxembourg."
LUX_restore_germanization:0 "Re-Germanization"
LUX_restore_germanization_desc:0 "Undoing the damage done since our people were so callously ripped from the arms of the Kaiserreich, Kratzenberg and the VdB have begun a process of ‘Re-Germanization’ aimed at readying the nation once again for German integration. All things French or foregin shall be wholly eradicated, with not even a trace left behind to continue spreading its vile taint. German shall be made the sole national language, and German culture will begin to take primacy even over native Luxembourgish tastes. Though there may be some pushback, it matters not, for anyone foolish enough to oppose our ideas shall be branded as the traitors they are and handled accordingly. Luxembourg is dead. Long live Luxemburg!"
LUX_art:0 "Teutonic Fine Art and High Culture"
LUX_art_desc:0 "The VdB got its start as the ‘Luxemburger Gesellschaft für Deutsche Literatur und Kunst’ - a scholarly society dedicated to the preservation and distribution of German high art and cultural products. However, following the rise of the Luxembourgish Left and the French Commune, the organization took on a more paramilitary and political focus. With our victory, it is time to return to this original goal. German art, films, food, poetry, literature, and all other forms of culture shall be disseminated throughout the nation as much as possible, with all opposing forms of culture - forign or domestic - being erased or otherwise suppressed. There is no room for lesser filth in our new Luxemburg! "
LUX_defend_against_france:0 "A Black Bastion Against France"
LUX_defend_against_france_desc:0 "We must make ourselves a black spot to the Internationale - a virtual hole in the map they dare not interact with or invade. We must make ourselves so seemingly unconquerable and unassailable that no amount of military effort would be worth taking over our tiny nation. Fortresses, barricades, redoubts, bunkers, gun emplacements, trenches, barbed wire - all of it and more shall be built across the nation en masse as we move to turn Luxemburg into a nation-wide fortification. Never again shall we fall to French boots!"
LUX_host_german_exiles:0 "Settle German Exiles"
LUX_host_german_exiles_desc:0 "As more and more Germans find their way into our borders, we have begun to find a use for them - as settlers. Incentivizing these tourists, exiles, and other Germanics to settle down in Luxemburg and plant their roots shall be no small task, but doing so will only seek to speed up our efforts of total Germanization. Even if we must start displacing those of lesser, non-Teutonic blood to accommodate these noble travelers, we shall ensure they settle here, for they are our future, and everything we aspire to be."

LUX_new_army:0 "A New Luxembourgish Army"
LUX_new_army_desc:0 "In order to defend our newly sovereign nation, we will need an army to defend ourselves. Currently, our military is little more than just some militias and resistance groups hobbled together under a new banner. This shoddy reality must be changed, or else we will face our next conflict woefully unprepared."
LUX_ducal_army:0 "A Ducal Army"
LUX_ducal_army_desc:0 "Hearkening to the legacy of the old Grand Duchy and our military prowess during the time of the Holy Roman Empire, we shall create an organized and professional army for Luxembourg. No longer the era of pike and shot, we must adapt our old tactics to this new era of warfare we have been thrust into. If we do so, no foe will be able to withstand the might of our royal armies."
LUX_new_royal_guard:0 "Restore the Garde Grand-Ducale"
LUX_new_royal_guard_desc:0 "The ‘Grand Guard of the Duchy’ were the royal guard of the Crown as well as expert peacekeepers and veterans in urban warfare. We should reform this now defunct military order and set it up as the core of our new army. Here, this veteran legacy shall form the foundations for our new military reforms."
LUX_red_army:0 "A Red Army"
LUX_red_army_desc:0 "Copying the best aspects of the Internaionale’s expeditionary forces, we shall emulate these new hegemons of the world and put their tactics to good use defending our homeland. With their expertise guiding the way, our newly born army shall rise from the ragtag group of militias it is now into a highly professional and highly efficient military force."
LUX_red_guard:0 "Create the Garde Rouge de Luxembourg"
LUX_red_guard_desc:0 "Emulating but surpassing the old Royal Guard, this new ‘Red Guard’ shall defend our nation and our party at all costs. By drawing the best tactics and ideas from the old Garde Grand-Ducale without taking the pomp and ceremony, we shall create the perfect vanguard force to supplement our main army."
LUX_buy_planes:0 "Swarm the Skies"
LUX_buy_planes_desc:0 "By reaching out to our new allies, we will be able to purchase their surplus aeronautical equipment for use in our own burgeoning air force. With their help, we shall source all the planes we need in order to kickstart this new wing of the Luxembourgish military as we endeavor to fill the skies and blot out the sun with our air wings."
LUX_establish_airforce:0 "Establish a Luxembourgish Air Force"
LUX_establish_airforce_desc:0 "With an initial seed of equipment and airplanes to get us started, we have pushed forward to begin organizing our own domestic air force. With these flyboys overhead patrolling our skies, our men on the ground will not only feel more secure, but will also be able to count on the big guns when they are truly needed, making their job in protecting the nation a whole lot easier."
LUX_spy_networks:0 "The Spëtzeldéngscht"
LUX_spy_networks_desc:0 "Attached to our diplomatic corp but kept hidden, the Service de Renseignement de l'État Luxembourgeois, or Spëtzeldéngscht as it is known more colloquially, is our main intelligence agency. Charged with defending Luxembourg from any subversive threat, both foreign and domestic, these agents work night and day for the defense of the nation. We should expand their operations and grant them more funding so that they can better patrol the dark underbelly of the globe for our benefit."
LUX_radar:0 "Military Telecommunications"
LUX_radar_desc:0 "Our nation already has a great telecommunications network, primarily centered around CLR - the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion. However, their network is primarily used for commercial and public services. We should move to work with CLR and other organizations like it, forcing these firms to work with our military and to give us access to their systems. With these towers and relay stations under our management, we should be able to create a radar net over the nation, ensuring nothing enters our airspace without us knowing."

LUX_fp:0 "Looking Out From Luxembourg"
LUX_fp_desc:0 "With our political climate stabilized and our national direction chosen, it is finally time to figure out our own place on the world stage. With the remnants of Germany and her allies pulling us in one direction while the Internationale pulls us in another, it seems that yet again Luxembourg is stuck between a rock and a hard place. We must once again choose our direction at this new crossroads, with the entirety of the nation and possibly even the wider world hanging in the balance."

LUX_fp_int:0 "Pro-Internationale Politics"
LUX_fp_int_desc:0 "With our Socialist regime intact, it is only natural for us to drift towards the Internationale even further.

LUX_eat_surrounding_land_desc:0 "All around us lies land stolen from us by foreign powers over the years. Whether it be the Germans, the Walloons, or even the French, the former lands of the Grand Duchy sit in foreign hands, and this cannot be allowed to stand.

LUX_red_benelux_desc:0 "With the Low Countries now all under our control, we shall push to integrate these lands fully into our administration.

LUX_world_revolution_desc:0 "There is but one destiny for mankind - complete unity under one Red banner. Though most scoff at this dream, calling it delusion or madness, we see past these surface-level glances. We see the real truth that lies at the heart of humanity’s shared future. The World must be dyed Red, and we shall be the heralds, the champions, the crusaders of this global crimson dawn."
LUX_denounce_int:0 "Denounce the Internationale"
LUX_denounce_int_desc:0 "The Internationale is a failed alliance. They merely use the power of Socialism to oppress those who once oppressed them instead of riding past their own borders to liberate humanity as a whole. We shall succeed where these lost fools failed. We do not need the Internationale. We do not need anyone! We alone shall save the Earth from itself!"
LUX_support_int:0 "Reaffirm Ties with Paris"
LUX_support_int_desc:0 "Though France and the wider Internationale may walk over our small state at times, they are still our closest allies - and our only hope are realizing our dream.

LUX_fp_non_int:0 "Our Own Ambitions"
LUX_fp_non_int_desc:0 "With our counter-revolution successful, it is only natural for us to break fully from the Inernationale to pursue our own goals. Free from the grasp of Socialism and France, our nation and our people must now find their own path in this chaotic and ever-changing world."
LUX_neutrality:0 "Lock Ourselves Away"
LUX_neutrality_desc:0 "The horrors and conflicts that swirl around us like a maelstrom cannot be fought or defeated. We have but one solution: isolationism. We shall shut our doors to the outside world aside from tacit economic deals to keep our economy humming along. Luxembourg will become a grey spot on the map of Europe, left alone and avoided while the other powers fight to the death over trivial ambitions."
LUX_peace_with_france:0 "Peace with Paris"
LUX_peace_with_france_desc:0 "Seeking peace above all other pursuits, our government has decided to plead to France for everlasting peace. We cannot hope to face the French in open battle, and so hopefully must appeal to their lighter side and convince them to merely leave our tiny, insignificant state alone. To sweeten the deal, we shall offer great economic concessions if we have to - anything to secure our independence and our neutrality."
LUX_declare_independence:0 "A Free and Sovereign Luxembourg"
LUX_declare_independence_desc:0 "With France guaranteeing our continued independence despite our differing governments, it would seem that Luxembourg neutrality and autonomy has finally been secured.

LUX_against_france:0 "A Bulwark Against the Reds"

The son of Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII and a famed warrior and diplomat in his own right, John the Blind is one of our greatest national heroes. By channeling his legacy and looking to his diplomatic and martial prowess for guidance, we shall build a new, greater Luxembourg that both honors our cultured legacy and triumphs over it so that we may do better than our ancestors ever could."

It is our turn to be their national savior now."
LUX_rejoin_germany:0 "The Question of Our Sovereignty"
LUX_rejoin_germany_desc:0 "With the Kaiserreich reestablished, many have begun to question whether or not we should rejoin Germany. Though the referendum we voted on in 1919 was near unanimous for joining their empire, a lot has changed in these past few decades. Though we are wholly dedicated to ‘Germanism,’ we are not sure if total dedication is worth selling off our hard-earned independence. Whatever our decision, our future lies with Germany regardless. Now all that is to decide is whether or not we shall be directly integrated once more."

LUX_eat_surrounding_land_ger_desc:0 "With our decision to remain an independent ally of the Kaiserreich, we have moved to make sure Germany pays us back for saving their skins. We demand that we are given special status both within the Reichspakt and Mitteleuropa fitting of our status as heroes and liberators.

lux.1.t:0 "Occupation of Luxembourg"
lux.1.d:0 "With our victories against Germany on their Western flank, we have come to control the area of Luxembourg. With our decision to not annex this plot of land, but instead to create an autonomous Socialist Republic there, General Henri Tanguy has been sent to administer the provisional government until a local Trade Union Congress can be established to organize elections. We wish Tanguy well on his new endeavor, and we shall watch this new Socialist Luexmbourger state with great interest."

lux.100.t:0 "A Crimson Dawn for Luxembourg"
lux.100.d:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles and a quick democratic referendum, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg joined the Kaiserreich as its newest constituent state. With the beloved Marie-Adélaïde remaining on her throne as Grand Duchess, Luxembourg took their new national situation in stride, and reaped the benefits of integration with Germany immensely. \n\nOver the following decades, much changed for the Duchy as it began to rapidly modernize and adapt to its new position in the Kaiserreich. Germanization programs and anti-French rhetoric became common, and tensions flared when German was made the second national language alongside Luxembourgish. Under their Grand Duchess, Luxembourg was rapidly industrialized, aided by its rich local iron and aluminum deposits - even rising to become the seat of illustrious and wealthy German industrial firms such as Deutsch-Luxemburgische Bergwerks-und Hütten-AG and Vereinigte Stahlhütten Burbach-Eich-Düdelingen, which fueled the nation’s rapid growth and brought even greater wealth to its people. However, this industrialization became a double-edged sword, for Socialist and Social Democratic ideals became popular in the region among the masses of factory workers, who assembled in secret cells to evade the Maulkuerfgesetz - anti-Socialist laws enacted at Germany’s behest. With the start of the Second Weltkrieg, pro-Internationale militias and resistance groups became a common sight. As these cells grew in power and as the Red Army marched from Paris towards Berlin, we were caught in the crossfire. During the chaos, the Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde was murdered by Syndicalist soldiers in an ambush - although a body was never recovered, with it presumed to be taken back to France as some sick trophy or simply abandoned in some God-forsaken ditch. Following this tragic crime, she was hastily replaced by her sister Charlotte as Grand Duchess, who was soon forced to flee into exile as the Red Star rose above Luxembourg City. \n\nFollowing the war, Luxembourg now finds itself under new management - made an autonomous socialist republic under the watch of a French-led occupational force commanded by General Henri Tenguy. General Tenguy, nicknamed Rol-Tenguy during his time aiding the Socialist Resistance in Luxembourg during the war, now leads the provisional government until the newly established Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vu Lëtzebuerg - or Syndicalist Trade Union Congress of Luxembourg - can fully organize a new administration and first elections. However, with monarchist elements still loyal to the Grand Duchess, republican resistance guided by Pierre Dupong, and the pro-German ‘Volksdeutsche Bewegung’ all on the prowl and waiting for their moment to strike, it would seem this new red pearl of the Internationale is not as welcoming to their red ‘liberation’ as they thought it would be. With this tense political stage set, anything could be in the cards for this industrialized jewel of the Lowlands."

With only Socialist parties being allowed in the running, the race has been narrowed down to three main candidates. The face of the Kongress and of our nation’s Leftist movement itself is Louis Charles Marx, who leads the Syndikalist Partei vu Lëtzebuerg in line with traditional French Orthodox Syndicalism and has amassed much of the support of the congress. Opposing the SPL is Michel Rasquin’s Lëtzebuerger Sozialistesch Aarbechterpartei - or the Luxembourg Socialist Worker’s Party - which stands as a broad coalition of various Social Democrats, Democratic Socialists, and other moderates, and Dominique Urbany’s Revolutionär Sozialistesch Partei - an Internationalist party inspired by the Tuckachevky and the failed Trotsky. With each candidate standing in a decent position before the race, it is any man’s game. With the final delegates within the Kongress passing their votes, it would seem that..."

In their absences, our meager Red Guard - itself nothing more than our resistance militias from the war rebranded - is all that stands in the way between our new red republic and the wolves that circle us even now. Wasting no time, numerous counter-revolutionary groups have already begun to organize. Among them are numerous different monarchists, republicans, and reactionaries who would all love nothing more than to see our people’s republic burn! Should we move out to crush these forces now before they can grow out of hand for our small military force, or shall we bide our time and reinforce - hoping that they do not strike while we are unprepared..."

Though we poured much time and investment into the ‘Luxembourg Project,’ with our current finances and military situation, it does not seem practical to once again try to prop up a government so clearly hated by its own people. However, these lost souls could just be trying to introduce Socialism all wrong, and they might just require our expert hand in the matter.

With our victory, some clemency has been offered to the more moderate Socialists - especially those among Rasquin’s NL - but for the large part, all other red traitors have been jailed or killed, with many more fleeing into exile in France. With these ruffians finally gone, the heroes and leading figures of our counter-revolution have come together to determine the fate of the nation. Holding a Kongress of their own in the grand hall of Schlass Fëschbech - or Berg Castle - these former enemies of the state now shall decide its future. Calling for the varied delegates - among them being pre-revolution politicians, military and resistance figures, nobility, and various other parties representing the Luxembourgish people. The two main camps of this debate have coalesced around the Grand Duchess Charlotte, who is supported by both avid monarchists and desperate republicans hoping to coax their sovereign into reintroducing democracy, and Damian Kratzenberg, a highschool teacher turned reactionary paramilitary leader who heads the viciously pro-German Volksdeutsche Bewegung.

With her republican allies still clamoring for democracy, she could very well restore democracy to its fullest, stepping back as monarch and relegating herself to an entirely ceremonial role. However, though this would appease these republican sycophants, it would be a slap in the face to every other supporter of hers who joined her cause during the counter-revolution due to her undying devotion to Luxembourgish tradition. To appease these groups, and possibly even her own ambition, Grand Duchess Charlotte could instead push forward as planned to restore the balanced, modern parliamentary monarchy her people are used to. Alternatively, the Grand Duchess could even take this further given her current position of dominance, and push to consolidate all executive power within her hands as a true absolute monarch. Whatever her choice be now, all of Luxembourg and its destiny now lie solely within her hands."
lux.8.a:0 "Listen to our people and restore full democratic elections!"
lux.8.b:0 "Pay lip service to democracy while establishing a more modern monarchy."
lux.8.c:0 "All power shall lie within the hands of the Grand Duchess!"

lux.9.t:0 "Our First Post-Revolution Elections"
lux.9.d:0 "Listening to our pleas, the Grand Duchess has moved to reintroduce democracy back to the people of Luxembourg, finally allowing their voices to be heard. With this announcement, the head of our government-in-exile Pierre Dupong has moved to organize new elections. Drawing all the right-wing elements within the nation not already fallen in with the VdB, Dupong has reestablished the Rietspartei, or the Party of the Right, seeking to bring Chrisitan Conservatism and monitored Capitalism back to our state. Opposing him for support among the center and right is Eugène Schaus, whose newly remade Liberal Liga shares many of the same beliefs that the Rietspartei holds while strongly pushing for Classical Liberalism, Secularism, and a freer market instead. Opposing these two moderate groups is Marcel Cahen’s Radikal Liberal Partei, who stands for Progressivism, Secularism, and Social Capitalism. Finally, running as the dark horse candidate is Michel Rasquin, who since the counter-revolution has denounced his extremist views, purging his old LSAP of radicals and rebranding it as ‘Néi Lénk’ - or the New Left. Rasquin is still a dedicated Socialist at heart, but now champions for Social Democracy and moderate reformism over revolutionary action. With the parties set and the votes being counted, it's only a matter of time before our new national direction is determined through democracy,"
lux.9.a:0 "Pierre Dupong’s Rietspartei unsurprisingly takes the win."
lux.9.b:0 "Eugène Schaus’ Liberal Liga seizes the day."
lux.9.c:0 "Marcel Cahen’s Radikal Liberal Partei comes out on top."
lux.9.3:0 "Michel Rasquin’s reformed and de-radicalized Néi Lénk wins the day."

lux.10.t:0 "Luxembourg Proposes a Union"
lux.10.d:0 "The President of [LUX.getname] has sent a delegation to our capital bearing a newly-minted offer of union between the nations of the Low Countries. Citing the need to better protect ourselves and our interests from the preying Super Powers, their President [LUX.getleader] has practically demanded that we unify for the sake of preserving our shared yet unique identities while maintaining our sovereignty. How shall we reply?"
lux.10.a:0 "We push forward for a brighter, redder future - together."
lux.10.b:0 "Are they mad?!"

lux.11.t:0 "Unity Offer Accepted"
lux.11.d:0 "It seems our delegation was met with warm welcomes and open ears, for our envoys have returned with great news - the foreign office of [target.getname] has agreed to our offer of unification. With their acceptance, [target.getname] shall soon fully integrate with our current administration, bringing the Low Countries one step close to total unification."
lux.11.a:0 "Stäerkt duerch Eenheet!"

lux.12.t:0 "Unity Offer Rejected"
lux.12.d:0 "It seems our delegation was met with jeers and derision, for our envoys have returned with solemn news - their foreign office has denied our offer of unification. Now, with their denial, we are left with two choices. We can either back down and pursue ambitions elsewhere, or we can declare war and march into their capital to teach them the error of their ways."
lux.12.a:0 "Damn! We have no choice but to back down."
lux.12.b:0 "Then we shall decide this through war!"

lux.14.t:0 "Luxembourg Demands Territory"
lux.14.d:0 "The small state of Luxembourg that we liberated from the Kaiserreich has now come asking for territorial concessions. Demanding that we and our allies cede over any lands that they rightfully claim - being the old lands of the former Grand Duchy - Luxembourg has agreed to pay handsomely for them. Though it is just Luxembourg, they are still our hard-won lands. What shall we do?"
lux.14.a:0 "Grant them their silly little demands."
lux.14.b:0 "We have fought too hard to simply give up this land!"

lux.15.t:0 "France Accepts"
lux.15.d:0 "Surprisingly, France has completely bent over and allowed us to take our claimed lands. Even now, these territories are being officially transferred over to our control, and soon our administration will have to figure out how to integrate them. Until then, we shall just enjoy this bloodless victory for what it truly is - a miracle!"
lux.15.a:0 "We welcome these lost lands with open arms."

lux.16.t:0 "France Rejects"
lux.16.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, France has categorically denied any and all territorial claims and ambitions our state held within their lands. This slap in the face leaves us with two very clear decisions to choose from - we can either accept this loss for what it is and walk away, or we can ride into Paris and burn down their precious ‘City of Lights’ for daring to stand in the way of Luxembourg and our glorious ambitions!"
lux.16.a:0 "Then we shall march on Paris and salt its earth!"
lux.16.b:0 "We must back down."

lux.17.t:0 "Rejoin the Reich"
lux.17.d:0 "With the reconstitution of the Kaiserreich, the debate as to whether or not we should rejoin it has once again begun to rage. Though we once voted to be a constituent state within the Reich, a lot has changed since 1919. Should we move to rejoin Germany, revalidating the old referendum, or shall we simply accept our new, independent reality?"
lux.17.a:0 "The referendum is still binding! Move for total integration!"
lux.17.b:0 "We shall face our new destiny independently."

lux.18.t:0 "Our Rightful Clay in Germany"
lux.18.d:0 "With Germany’s liberation finalized, the Kaiserreich has once more risen in Central Europe. Now, with their revival out of the way, many within our administration have pushed for the return of our territorial claims, particularly around the Rhein. Though it may be a lot to ask of our newly liberated allies, this may be the only time we can ask for these territories with any hope of them saying yes. What shall we do?"
lux.18.a:0 "Send the demand at once!"
lux.18.b:0 "We cannot ask so much of our newly-liberated allies."

lux.19.t:0 "Luxembourg Demands Territorial Concessions"
lux.19.d:0 "With our Kaisereich reestablished and with Wilhelm back on the throne, it would seem that our luck is finally beginning to change. However, one last loose end still hangs from our liberation. Luxembourg, claiming land along the Rhein and near the Ruhr, has come asking our newly-rebuilt regime to hand over their ‘rightful’ territory to the Luxembourgish government. Any other time, such a request would only be met with outrage. However, given that the Luxembourgers led the liberation efforts to save our empire, perhaps we could shave off some small sliver of our land to appease them. What shall be our response?"
lux.19.a:0 "They saved our nation, it is the least we could do."
lux.19.b:0 "Are they mad?! The Kaiserreich remains indivisible!"

lux.20.t:0 "Germany Accepts Our Territorial Demands"
lux.20.d:0 "Shocking most within the nation, the Kaiserreich has decided to graciously and peacefully hand over our claimed territories. With this decision, we now have access to the Rheinland and its riches without restriction. We shall utilize this new living space to great effect as we build up the new Luxembourgish state."
lux.20.a:0 "One step closer to a greater Luxembourg!"

lux.21.t:0 "Germany Refuses"
lux.21.d:0 "To no surprise, the returning German hegemon has denied us our demands of Greater Luxembourg. After all we’ve done for them, we should have seen such treachery coming. While our troops may not be eager to fight their recent allies so soon, we should attack Germany while they are still rebuilding their fractured nation. Otherwise, we would surely crumble under their manpower and industrial might."
lux.21.a:0 "Perhaps we are content with our domain as it is."
lux.21.b:0 "Hit them while their pants are down! War!"

lux.22.t:0 "Enacting Plan Voisin"
lux.22.d:0 "First drafted by the famous architect Le Corbusier in 1925 and sponsored by avant garde engineer Gabriel Voisin, ‘Plan Voisin’ was originally planned to rebuild all of Paris into a modernist ‘Ville Contemporaine’ or Contemporary City. However, with the French rejecting this proposal, Dominique Urbany has come to suggest that all of Luxembourg be urbanized following these plans. Drawing inspiration from Le Corbusier’s other works such as ‘Ville Radieuse,’ and with Le Corbusier directly overseeing the project, it is planned for all 12 major cities of central Luxembourg to be linked together into one massive and unyielding urban expanse, with the core being the first party started and planned to be at the heart of current Luxembourg City. \n\nThe centerpiece of this plan is a group of sixty-story cruciform skyscrapers built on steel frames and encased in curtain walls of glass. The skyscrapers will house both offices and the apartments of our most valued public officials and representatives, changing hands as their positions change hands as well. These skyscrapers are to be set within large, rectangular park-like green spaces adorned with natural foliage and decorations as well as public art and other monuments to the nation. At the center of the planned city shall be a transportation hub which will house depots for buses and trains as well as highway intersections and at the top, an airport to ferry all our citizens around the nation without hassle. Le Corbusier’s design segregates the pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways, and glorifies the use of the automobile as a means of transportation. If one were to move out from the central skyscrapers, smaller multi-story zigzag blocks set in green space and set far back from the street would house the masses of our proletarian workers. \n\nIn this plan, the car would abolish the human street, and possibly the human foot. Some people would have aeroplanes too. The one thing no one would have is a place to bump into each other, walk the dog, strut, or one of the hundred other random things that people do - for being random was loathed by Le Corbusier and thus was a central part of the plan. Its inhabitants will surrender their freedom of movement to the omnipresent architect, and with this plan, Le Corbsuier and President Urbany shall build a new Luxembourg for our future generations to enjoy, though it will likely take many decades for the full plan to be finally complete, and the price is expected to be astronomical. The result, however, will be nothing short of a modern masterpiece."
lux.22.a:0 "We break ground on our new future!"

lux.23.t:0 "The True Enemy of the Revolution Revealed"
lux.23.d:0 "Our French allies have come to us with an intriguing piece of information. According to them, our former Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde was not really killed during the Second Weltkrieg like common reports indicate, but was instead taken prisoner by the French army and has been kept at a PoW camp in Paris ever since. With this revelation, France has offered to transfer custody of the former Grand Duchess to our hands, allowing us to put this traitor to our Revolution on trial for the entire nation to bear witness. Following a speedy trial before the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress where she will surely be found guilty of her crimes, Marie-Adélaïde will then be transferred to the Grund Prison where she will await her execution by revolutionary guillotine. Thanks to our friend in Paris, we will finally have our justice over the old monarchy!"
lux.23.a:0 "Off with her head!"

lux.24.t:0 "A New Schlaraffenland"
lux.24.d:0 "Chancellor Damian Kratzenberg and his VdB have done much to create a new and proudly Germanic Luxemburg for all the world to see. This new ‘Schlaraffenland,’ or land of plenty, has risen to nurture the Teutonic spirit of the Luxemburger people. We have gone to embody the medieval literary myth of  ‘Cockaigne’ - a land of extreme luxury and comfort for all true sons and daughters of Germany. Here, German culture and tradition are upheld like nowhere else on Earth, for only things Germanic in nature are truly worth experiencing. Foreign goods and practices are completely banned, but our people do not go for want, for our newly revitalized and Germanized culture sustains them plenty. Our culture is tied to the noble Kaiserreich and the great legacy that it was built upon, and now we share in that legacy too. Let us revel in this new Schlaraffenland as we bask alongside the Kaiserreich and take our place under the sun beside them!"
lux.24.a:0 "Let all true Teutonic sons and daughters bask in this new land of plenty."

lux.25.t:0 "From Spare to Sovereign"
lux.25.d:0 "Though she technically ruled following the apparent death of her sister, Grand Duchess Charlotte is largely new to the whole concept of royal rule and national leadership, and despite her time leading the government-in-exile, she still has much to learn before she can truly come to care for her people. Deeply inexperienced and woefully unprepared, Charlotte must learn how to lead by example, following in the footsteps of her late father - the beloved William IV - and her sister - the adored Marie-Adélaïde - to learn how to truly care for her new subjects. Though she has much to learn, Charlotte has already shown a sharp aptitude for diplomacy and compromise, as well as proven her skill at ruling under pressure as seen with her calm and calculated command over our past resistance efforts. With the people rallied around their national heroine, the Grand Duchess has the nation at her back as she attempts to guide them through this era of great turbulence and strife."
lux.25.a:0 "Following their image, the Grand Duchess shall surely rise to meet the needs of the people."

lux.26.t:0 "Rebirth of Luxembourgish Democracy"
lux.26.d:0 "With elections now done and gone, it would seem that true democracy has finally been ushered into Luxembourg. With the Grand Duchess reigning in a largely ceremonial position, our republican government has been free to blossom, and now the fruits of our labors are just beginning to show. The people once again have started to place faith and hope into our government as their voices are heard clearly and without ulterior motives for the first time in years, while our nation’s reconstruction efforts in the wake of the near-endless conflicts wracking Europe have done much to heal the wounds of war. Though we livin in a changed nation as a changed people in a changed world, a new status quo has begun to set in - one uplifted by democratic freedoms and supported by the will of our people."
lux.26.a:0 "Finally, our people have a say once again."

lux.27.t:0 "Violence in the Streets between Reds and Blacks"
lux.27.d:0 "With the arrival of the Luxembourgish Revolution and General Henri Tanguy’s forces, Luxembourg has been thrown into chaos. The streets are lined with blood and bodies as French and German ethnic minorities battle it out in the streets while Red militias fight reactionary black-shirted paramilitaries for control of the government. At the center of it all is General Tanguy and his provisional government, hoping to keep some semblance of peace and stability long enough so that a true people’s republic can be proclaimed. With debates of language, religion, ideology, and ethnicity all spiraling out of control, it is up to Rol-Tanguy to save Luxembourg and its people from themselves."
lux.27.a:0 "We must find a way to put these ethnic tensions to rest!"

lux.28.t:0 "From Grand Duchy to Holy Empire"
lux.28.d:0 "Once one of the smallest constituent states of the old Holy Roman Empire, the Grand Duchy under the guidance of Grand Duchess Charlotte has risen past these humble beginnings and has come to dominate Germany, now standing as the instrument of its revival. Declaring a new age for the Germanic peoples and Luxembourgers themselves, the Grand Duchess has proclaimed the ‘Neit Hellege Réimesche Räich,’ or the New Holy Roman Empire. Modernizing the old system tremendously, the new ‘HRR’ is more of a conservative federation, with all the old states of the Kaiserreich standing as the new Gaue of the empire, and with local princes and other nobles each placed at the helm of the Gaue like before. The highest among these new nobles shall be named as the new Prince Electors, whose job it shall be to elect each new Empress or Emperor following Charlotte's reign, while a lower legislative house shall exist, with the representatives of said council being elected from among the masses by the masses. Catholicism and Protestant Christianity have been named as the two main faiths, but Judaism and other notable minorities have been allowed to continue their practice. Diplomatic relations have already begun to be established with our closest kindred spirit in Vienna, and our two great empires already drift closer to one another as we speak. All of this and more has been achieved by our noble Grand Duchess. May Charlotte ling a long life and have a prosperous reign as the newly dubbed Charlotte I, the First Empress of the Neit Hellege Réimesche Räich!"
lux.28.a:0 "May the Neit Hellege Réimesche Räich live a thousand years!"

The Proletariat of this new ‘Benelux-Unioun’ are now safe under one banner, united as one people, and wholly dedicated to one cause: preserving the Revolution and our hard fought freedoms at all costs. We shall not let the foul reactionaries both within our new union and outside our borders topple our Revolution, for we carry with us the mandate of the Proletariat, and with their support, we shall never falter. With Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg as one, there is nothing BeNeLux cannot achieve!"

lux.30.d:0 "Following her husband Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma’s claim to the old territory of the ‘Spanish Netherlands,’ the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg Charlotte Adelgonde Élise of Nassau-Weilburg has brought the Low Countries together in union, finally. Whether it be through diplomacy, war, or both, this important border region lies between the lands of the two latest world hegemons, and as such, we have come together to resist the aims and influence of these rival powers. The people of this new ‘Benelux-Unioun’ are now safe under one banner, united as one people, and wholly dedicated to one cause: preserving our newfound union and our unique, shared identity at all costs. We shall not let the vile Socialists both within our new union and outside our borders topple our glorious union, for we carry with us the mandate of God and the people, and with their support, we shall never falter.

lux.31.d:0 "With the wise and measured rule of [LUX.getleader], our once small and vulnerable state has navigated the treacherous waters of international diplomacy, and has somehow come out on top. Defying all odds, our nation has survived on the border of two warring super powers and still achieved greatness. The maximum extent of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg’s territory, last held in 1659, has finally been reclaimed by our people. Losing land over the centuries to Belgium, France, and Germany, these partitions of Luxembourg have been avenged. Under [LUX.getleader], greatness, prosperity, and honor have been fully restored to our people. Glory to Greater Luxembourg!  "
lux.31.a:0 "We want to remain what we are, and now we have the strength to do so."

lux.32.t:0 "The World Revolution Semi-Triumphant"
lux.32.d:0 "With President Dominique Urbany setting Luxembourg up as the herald of the Totalist World Revolution, all laughed in our faces, calling Urbany a madman or a moron. This day, those detractors have grown silent, for they either lay dead six feet under or are in speechless awe at what we have finally achieved here this day. Our Internationalist mission has succeeded where all thought we would fail, and now all of Europe sits under the Red Star of Totalism. With Urbany now proclaiming himself Chairman of the Union of European Totalist Republics, all of Europe has been bathed in this new crimson dawn. Though it is not the total World Revolution Chairman Urbany had hoped for, this would have to do...for now."
lux.32.a:0 "Well, at least part of the world was unified. Good enough."

With the planet in his pocket, Chairman Urbany has proclaimed the Union of International Totalist Republics, and with it, the proletariat is finally free of oppression and subjugation; their chains finally broken. Under Chairman Urbany, our little marble of blue and green has been transformed into a marble of deep Red as Urbany heralds his new Totalist utopia. What lies in store for the world next no one truly knows, though many can guess. What matters now is that the Proletariat is finally free, not just here, or there, but everywhere!"

lux.34.d:0 "One of our regular combat patrols has radioed back to our command with a most tempting opportunity. Agents from the Renseignements Généraux attached to the squad have informed us that while making their way towards a rendezvous point as they prepare for a final push against Luxembourg City, the patrol squad has come across the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg Marie-Adélaïde and her military convoy taking a refueling stop on their way to whatever resistance den these foolish reactionaries have been hiding out in. Sensing opportunity knocking, the squad wishes to move in and engage the convoy while it is stopped, hoping to kill the noble face of the Luxembourg resistance once and for all. However, our agents from the Renseignements Généraux instead see an opportunity to kidnap this head of state, possibly pumping them of precious intel and other state secrets while interring her in one of the war-time PoW camps. With our window of time closing and the squad waiting on the line, what are our orders?"

Following this tragic crime, her sister Charlotte hastily took the throne shortly before the entire Duchy was toppled, and no body was ever recovered, with our administration passing it up to either the French soldiers claiming it as some sick trophy, or it was simply dumped somewhere never to be found again. However, it would seem that neither of these scenarios are the case, for new evidence uncovered after the counter-revolution has brought the truth to light. \n\nIt would seem that the ambushers were no regular Commune soldiers, but elite agents of their Renseignements Généraux, and that their true desire was to kidnap the Grand Duchess - a plot they succeeded in. Bringing Marie-Adélaïde across the French border and into Paris, the partisans passed her off to the French who have kept her in a prison camp since. However, after a German bombing raid hit the camp she was held in, Marie-Adélaïde managed to escape, and has slowly and covertly made her way back here to our custody to exclaim her survival. \n\nEventually, VdB border guards found the withered and exhausted Marie-Adélaïde wandering the forests outside Redagne, and upon recognizing who she was, immediately took her into custody and brought her before Chancellor Kratzenberg where she explained her entire ordeal to our cabinet. With the notoriously pro-German and rightful Grand Duchess now in our custody, we are left with two choices. We could reveal this truth to the public and crown Marie-Adélaïde as the new Grand Duchess, reproclaiming the Duchy but shackeling her to our will as a puppet monarch, or we can simply make her and this whole nonsense disappear without the public ever knowing.

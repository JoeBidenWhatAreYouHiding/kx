### Leaders ###
POLITICS_CHARLES_MARX_DESC:0 "After completing his medical studies in the Commune of France and a brief stint practicing there, Charles Marx, convinved socialist returned to his native Luxemburg. There, with secret French funding, Marx founded a hospital, secretly using it to spread socialist ideas among patients and the medical community. Indeed, it was his hospital where Luxemburg's syndicalist party was secretly founded. With Luxemburgish independence restored, and under a socialist government no less, the party appointed Marx as head of state."

### Ideas ###
LUX_destroyed_national_identity:0 "Decimated National Identity"
LUX_destroyed_national_identity_desc:0 "After decades under German rule and now with the French occupation, the clarity of the Luxembourgish national identity is at an all time low since the birth of our national conscience. We must work to undo this nationalist corrosion of our own domestic culture, lest we simply melt away into the wider identity of our occupiers."
LUX_destroyed_national_identity2:0 "Recovering National Identity"
LUX_destroyed_national_identity2_desc:0 "With our initial efforts to restore our national identity going well, our people are once again taking pride in calling themselves Luxembourgers. Though we still have a long way to go before our culture is truly healed, at least we are no longer just Frenchmen or Germans with a different language."
LUX_destroyed_national_identity3:0 "Blossoming National Identity"
LUX_destroyed_national_identity3_desc:0 "As Luxembourgish nationalism only continues to spread like wildfire, it would seem that our culture has been ushered into a new renaissance. Though dangerous nationalist elements have once again begun to spread, they can be kept easily in check by the overwhelming tide of ‘positive’ nationalism espoused by our less radical citizens. Though we are not out of the woods yet, it would seem that not only is our national identity no longer destined for extinction - on the contrary, it would seem that we are on the brink of a new cultural golden age!"

LUX_language_question:0 "Language Question"
LUX_language_question_desc:0 "Following the Weltkrieg and our annexation into the Kaiserreich through referendum in 1919, German was made a second national language alongside our native tongue of Luxembourgish. Following the arrival of the French Occupation however, German was removed as a national language with French rising to take its place. This linguistic gymnastic has only stoked ethnic tensions within the nation while alleviating next to nothing. We must figure out a final solution to this language question, lest it rip our nation apart."

### Focuses ###
LUX_frog_occupation:0 "French Occupation"
LUX_frog_occupation_desc:0 "With their victories on the Western Front, the French Syndicalists have come to ‘liberate’ our beautiful nation from so-called ‘corrupt and reactionary’ German rule. Despite our nation’s democratic decision following the Weltkrieg to join the Kaiserreich, it would seem that we have been robbed of this mandate, and now find ourselves autonomous but occupied under Paris. With the arrival of General Henri Tanguy, ‘Déi Lénk’ has risen to national prominence, and it would seem that Luxembourg - whether the masses like it or not - will soon be a Socialist nation."
LUX_drive_out_german_influence:0 "Drive Out German Influence"
LUX_drive_out_german_influence_desc:0 "With the arrival of the Internationale occupation, our new allies have seen it fit to remove all German influence within Luxembourg. Given our long-held ties to the Kaiserreich and the degree of Germanification our culture and society have undergone, this shall be no small feat. Our new benefactors must be careful how far and how fast they push, however, for even now the wolves circle their new government."
LUX_re_establish_identity:0 "Re-Establish a National Identity"
LUX_re_establish_identity_desc:0 "What it means to be a pure and independent Luxembourger has been muddied, for we have been tied to Berlin and the Rheinish Germans for quite some time. Our provisional government has moved to revive the Luxembourgish identity, bolstered now by social nationalist and civic nationalist ideas from Paris. We shall take back what it means to be a Luxembourger!"
LUX_new_nation_new_politics:0 "New Nation, New Politics"
LUX_new_nation_new_politics_desc:0 "The Luxembourg that stands ‘independent’ today is a far-cry from its past self. With the monarchy deposed and with the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress now in temporary command, our nation has been radically changed - for better or for worse. Now it is up to the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vun Lëtzebuerg to decide the fate of our newly crimson state."

LUX_soc_victory:0 "Luxembourg’s Crimson Dawn"
LUX_soc_victory_desc:0 "With guidance from General Tanguy and his attache from Paris, the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vun Lëtzebuerg has heralded a new destiny for Luxembourg. A new people’s republic has been founded over the ashes of the old Duchy, and now our new state is ready to tackle the rigors of state-craft. Soon, Tanguy and his men will be a distant memory as we take our first independent steps into this new wide and Red world. As our first elections are prepared, we begin to take our new destiny in stride!"

LUX_synd:0 "Marx’s SPL"
LUX_synd_desc:0 "Following tense elections within the Kongress, Louis Charles Marx has been elected as the first President of our red republic. Serving as the face of ‘Déi Lénk’ and as the most widely respected Socialist in the nation, Marx was the favorite to win. Now as leader of our nation, Marx shall guide both the Syndikalist Partei vu Lëtzebuerg and the wider country as a whole on the long road to achieving true Syndicalism."
LUX_trade_unions:0 "Towards Syndicalism Through Unionism"
LUX_trade_unions_desc:0 "In order to rally the people and prepare them for true Syndicalism, we will have to dip their toes in it first. By expanding unions to every industry in the nation, and by making them voluntary at first, we shall slowly raise membership through honest practices and tempting incentives as we seek to fully unionize the nation. Only through total unionization can our nation be truly free, democratic, and equal."
LUX_german_compromise:0 "Language Compromise"
LUX_german_compromise_desc:0 "Until our integration into Germany, the only national language was Luxembourgish. However, with our admittance into the Kaiserreich, German rose to be a national language as well, only to be replaced by French with the rise of our revolution. Though all three languages have long been used in Luxembourg, it has always been a point of tension, but Marx has seen a solution. By allowing all three languages to hold equal status within the nation, we shall appease everyone at once, placing us on track to reduce ethnic tensions across the nation."
LUX_national_medical_system:0 "Win Over the Masses with Healthcare"
LUX_national_medical_system_desc:0 "Syndicalism still stands as a foreign and feared movement to many within the nation, even among our Leftist allies. Fearing complete societal reorganization and bloody redistributions, the masses need to be put at ease for now until we are in a position to pursue our more radical goals. With the war leaving many sick and wounded, it would be ideal to create a national healthcare service to provide free medical care to all citizens of our republic. By using this program as a goodwill tool, we shall win over the citizenry through medicine and bandages while we slowly reform society around them."

LUX_internationale_tourist_hub:0 "The Tourist Trap of the Internationale"
LUX_internationale_tourist_hub_desc:0 "Luxembourg is the new crimson pearl of Western Europe - a beautiful slice of the Old World that has long stood as a popular tourist destination. With the famous wineries, castles, and natural scenery of our nation now beyond the Red Curtain, it would be wise to advertise them to the rest of the Internationale. We shall become the tourist trap of the proletariat, and use this drummed-up business to bolster our economy."
LUX_nationalize_wine_industry:0 "Nationalize the Wine Industry"
LUX_nationalize_wine_industry_desc:0 "Luxembourg is famous for its rich, fertile soil and immense mineral wealth for such a small nation, but none of our produce is as famous as Luxembourger wine. By collectivizing and nationalizing the vineyards and wineries across the nation and putting them under governmental supervision, we shall increase the output of these historic establishments while bringing the profits to the people. All mouths in the Internationale shall be able to taste our exquisite wine, no matter their standing!"

LUX_radsoc:0 "Rasquin’s LSAP"
LUX_radsoc_desc:0 "Maneuvering past his political rivals, Michel Rasquin and his Lëtzebuerger Sozialistesch Aarbechterpartei has won the first post-revolutionary elections. Standing as a coalition of various moderate and fringe Socialists, Social Democrats, and Democratic Socialists, LSAP preaches for slow, steady, and purely democratic reform to bring true Socialism to Luxembourg. With Rasquin being sworn in and with his coalition behind him, the nation shall soon bear witness to his radically progressive ideals."
LUX_national_coalition_govt:0 "Bolster the Grand Coalition"
LUX_national_coalition_govt_desc:0 "Rasquin’s electoral, and now professional, success relies entirely on the Grand Coalition. Already containing everything from Anarchists to Social Democrats, Rasquin seeks to take this a step farther for the good of all Luxembourgers. By offering an olive branch to any and all republican and democratic elements within the nation that agrees to renouncing any and all ties with Germany, Rasquin hopes to win-over a large enough portion of the political scene to no longer need to worry about factionalism or reactionary tendencies. With many progressive and liberal politicians already stepping forward to join this enlarged big-tent group, it is sure to ensure political stability for years to come."
LUX_language_unity:0 "Unity Through Language"
LUX_language_unity_desc:0 "Eschewing ideas of bias and non-conformity, Rasquin’s LSAP has proposed a new bill to finally solve the language issue. Until our integration into Germany, the only national language was Luxembourgish, with German later rising to be another national language with our annexation, only to then be replaced by French with the rise of our revolution. This has caused a great deal of ethnic and cultural tension within the nation, and to solve it, Rasquin has decided to return to the old status quo. Soon, only Luxembourgish will be the accepted national language once again. With this one and united language, we shall forcibly make our nation one and united as well, for the good of all Luxembourgers."
LUX_working_class_identity:0 "Uplift the Working Class Hero"
LUX_working_class_identity_desc:0 "The common man is the backbone of our nation. On their shoulders, our revolution was carried to victory, and in their hands, our new destiny lies. We should all aspire to be like these heroes of Luxembourg, for each and every single one of them - from the simple labourers and factory workers to the industrious miners and refinerymen - contribute to the heart and soul of our new people’s republic. The new Luxembourgish man shall model themselves in the image of these simple heroes as we craft our culture into one fitting for the noble peasants and and wondrous workers we now aspire to be."

LUX_tot:0 "Urbany’s RSP"
LUX_tot_desc:0 "Astounding many, the self-called ‘Trotskyist’ and Internationalist Dominique Urbany has come out on top in the Kongress, and now leads Luxembourg with his Revolutionär Sozialistesch Partei. Under the RSP and Urbany, Luxembourg shall now be painted a deep crimson as Urbany drives the nation towards Internationalist Maximism based upon the Totalist Charter and the ideas of Tukhachevsky and Trotsky. With Urbany at the helm, Luxembourg shall play its part in the World Revolution, but until then, our focus should be on building up Totalism in one nation first - our nation."
LUX_planned_cities:0 "Plan Out Our Utopia"
LUX_planned_cities_desc:0 "Seeking to improve quality of life and efficiency, a new urban development plan has been drafted by Urbany and his associates in the RSP. This new plan, called ‘,’ seeks to link the twelve noble cities of Luxembourg into one massive urban sprawl. The idea calls for Luxembourg itself to be consumed by a concrete jungle with Luxembourg City at its core, built in modernist and futurist styles borrowed from the Internationale, linked together with cutting-edge mass transit systems, and dotted with cultural and natural sites to preserve beauty and function. This new plan will possibly take decades to complete, but like all great projects, you have to break ground sometime, so why not now?!"
LUX_ban_germ_language:0 "Fierce Anti-Germanism"
LUX_ban_germ_language_desc:0 "Reviling anything Germanic or Teutonic in origin, Urbany and his RSP have virtually declared war on ‘Germanism.’ Outlawing their language, their literature, their films, their art, their cuisine, and anything else having to do with that damnable nation, Urbany’s regime will stop at nothing to completely de-Germanize Luxembourg. With anti-German crimes and assaults becoming common, and even endorsed by the state, Luxembourg will give over fully to its nationalist and pro-French ties, replacing all sources of German influence with either Luxembourgish or French sources instead."
LUX_internationalism:0 "Beacon of the Word Revolution"
LUX_internationalism_desc:0 "Following Urbany’s initial successes at bringing Totalism to Luxembourg, he has moved to proclaim the World Revolution. Calling upon all Socialist movements across the world to rise up and break their chains together, Urbany has begun to set up Luxembourg to be the beacon of this new world. Though many do not seem keen on answering the call, even with our own nation, Urbany has carried on regardless, and has begun making plans for Luxembourg to take on the world if it must if that means the Dictatorship of the Totalist Proletariat can finally be established. Totalists of the world, unite!"

LUX_countercoup:0 "The Luxembourgish Counter-Revolution"
LUX_countercoup_desc:0 "Fighting tooth and nail against the Socialist regime and their Internationale backers, we have come out victorious. Luxembourg has been saved by the hands of our coalition, and now a new, redless sun dawns on our freed nation. With the coalition that saved our country from Socialism already splintering apart, we once more stand at a crossroads. However, with our spirits high, we shall march into this new unknown dutifully, for we have a new nation to build, and we mustn't dawdle!"

LUX_monarchy_restored:0 "Revival of the Grand Duchy"
LUX_monarchy_restored_desc:0 "Taking her rightful throne once more, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Adelgonde Élise of Nassau-Weilburg once again rules over Luxembourg. With the nation licking its wounds in the wake of both the French Occupation and the counter-revolution, it is up to the Grand Duchess to guide the country and our people out of this mire and towards a brighter future. Now is no longer the time to sit about and wallow in the ashes of our old order. Now is the time to rebuild, to reconquer, and to reaffirm what it means to be a Luxembourger!"
LUX_constitutional_monarchy:0 "A Constitutional Duchy"
LUX_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "Choosing to heed her Republican allies, the Grand Duchess has agreed to cede some of her power to a parliamentary system, allowing democracy to once again take hold in Luxembourg. With democratic parties already reforming and with elections already planned, it is only a matter of time now before the jewel that was our old democracy is fully restored!"
LUX_master_of_diplomacy:0 "Master of Diplomacy"
LUX_master_of_diplomacy_desc:0 "Loving matters of diplomacy far more than politics or ideology, the Grand Duchess Charlotte has moved forward with her plan to create a new diplomatic corp for the state tied directly to the Crown. This organization, led by Charlotte herself, shall work to establish diplomatic ties with foreign dignitaries and officials from around the globe in order to find allies, economic partnerships, and other ‘friends’ to help ensure our survival. Luxembourg cannot be left out in the cold without backup again, and Charlotte’s charm and grace shall be our ticket there."
LUX_auth_monarchy:0 "An Absolute Duchy"
LUX_auth_monarchy_desc:0 "Eschewing calls for democracy and ignoring her republican allies, Grand Duchess Charlotte has decided to keep all powers of the executive for herself and the Crown, effectively creating an absolute monarchy within the Duchy. With all power now in her hands, the Grand Duchess has risen to become one of the last true absolutists left. Guided by her steady hand, strong will, and sharp wit, the Grand Duchy shall ride forth into its new destiny with gusto as hundreds of years of tradition carry us forth!"
LUX_Maulkuerfgesetz_law:0 "Maulkuerfgesetz"
LUX_Maulkuerfgesetz_law_desc:0 "In order to crack down on any radical Leftist elements left within the nation, a new antisocialist law has been proposed. Named the Muzzle Law, or Maulkuerfgesetz, this bill is aimed at the defense of political and social order within Luxembourg over all other pursuits. Effectively banning all Socialist action - whether it be party organization, assembly, newspaper printing, or anything else - Luxembourg will be cleansed of Syndicalists one way or another, for any of those who are foolish enough to not obey the law shall simply be arrested or conveniently ‘disappeared.’"
LUX_ducal_restoration:0 "Complete Ducal Restoration"
LUX_ducal_restoration_desc:0 "With the minutiae and specifics now sorted through, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is to be officially and totally restored in all of its former glory. Grand Duchess Charlotte is to be ‘re-crowned’ in an opulent ceremony for all the nation to bear witness to, serving as a metaphorical ‘new’ beginning for the Duchy. With this ceremony, our new destiny shall begin in earnest, and we shall take on the future with our restored suzerin above us to guide our path along the way."
LUX_church_backing:0 "Allies in the Church"
LUX_church_backing_desc:0 "Luxembourg has long, deep ties to the Catholic Church, with over 90% of the nation following the faith, though the degree of their piety of course varies quite a lot. Regardless, we are a proudly Catholic nation, guided by a Catholic monarch that upholds Catholic values. It is a no-brainer that we should move to align more closely with the Church, both here in Luxembourg and in Rome. With support from our fellow Catholics, our restored Duchy will never falter to sin, hedonism, and debauchery ever again!"
LUX_encourage_tourism:0 "Encourage Foreign Tourism"
LUX_encourage_tourism_desc:0 "Long has Luxembourg been a popular tourist destination, with German nobles having used our quaint patch of verdant land to relax and unwind as far back as the times of the Holy Roman Empire. We should respark this foreign interest in our nation, and move to revitalize the tourist industry that once boomed here. By hyping up our rich heritage and showcasing ourselves as one of the last slices of Old Europe, we shall ride to new prosperity atop a wave of foreigners seeking to take in our nation’s beauty and culture."
LUX_new_banking:0 "The Heart of European Banking"
LUX_new_banking_desc:0 "Alongside the infamous alpine nation to the South, Luxembourg has long stood as one of the main centers of European banking for centuries. However, after two revolutions and two world wars, we are in a sore spot. We must revitalize our financial industry, reopen our banks to foreign investment and dealings, and re-mark Luxembourg on the maps of the world denoting that we are once again open for all your banking needs! With their capital, we too shall grow rich."
LUX_new_aristocracy:0 "Restore the Luxembourgish Aristocracy"
LUX_new_aristocracy_desc:0 "With much of our nobility being killed in the revolutions or having fled the nation, never to return, our newly restored Duchy finds itself sorely lacking when it comes to bluebloods to accompany the Grand Duchess. To alleviate this, empty titles shall be given to new families who proved themselves in the counter-revolution as being loyal allies to the Crown. These heroes shall be treated as such, and given the recognition and rewards they so rightfully deserve. Though many come from lowly blood, that shall soon change as their blood is elevated as they are granted these titles. Besides, after a few generations of inbreeding and intermingling with the other royals of Europe, it will be impossible to tell otherwise."

LUX_natpop_coup:0 "A Luxembourg for the Germanic Race"
LUX_natpop_coup_desc:0 "The vile Socialists tried to rob us of our proud Germanic legacy, but we were able to crush them handily by utilizing our warrior’s spirit and by channeling our Teutonic heritage. Now, with the Syndicalists dead or imprisoned, the Volksdeutsche Bewegung under Damian Kratzenberg shall purge Luxembourg of all non-Germanic elements. There is no room for ‘French-ness’ or any other impurities in this new Luxembourg."
LUX_restore_germanization:0 "Re-Germanization"
LUX_restore_germanization_desc:0 "Undoing the damage done since our people were so callously ripped from the arms of the Kaiserreich, Kratzenberg and the VdB have begun a process of ‘Re-Germanization’ aimed at readying the nation once again for German integration. All things French or foregin shall be wholly eradicated, with not even a trace left behind to continue spreading its vile taint. German shall be made the sole national language, and German culture will begin to take primacy even over native Luxembourgish tastes. Though there may be some pushback, it matters not, for anyone foolish enough to oppose our ideas shall be branded as the traitors they are and handled accordingly. Luxembourg is dead. Long live Luxemburg!"
LUX_art:0 "Teutonic Fine Art and High Culture"
LUX_art_desc:0 "The VdB got its start as the ‘Luxemburger Gesellschaft für Deutsche Literatur und Kunst’ - a scholarly society dedicated to the preservation and distribution of German high art and cultural products. However, following the rise of the Luxembourgish Left and the French Commune, the organization took on a more paramilitary and political focus. With our victory, it is time to return to this original goal. German art, films, food, poetry, literature, and all other forms of culture shall be disseminated throughout the nation as much as possible, with all opposing forms of culture - forign or domestic - being erased or otherwise suppressed. There is no room for lesser filth in our new Luxemburg! "
LUX_defend_against_france:0 "A Black Bastion Against France"
LUX_defend_against_france_desc:0 "We must make ourselves a black spot to the Internationale - a virtual hole in the map they dare not interact with or invade. We must make ourselves so seemingly unconquerable and unassailable that no amount of military effort would be worth taking over our tiny nation. Fortresses, barricades, redoubts, bunkers, gun emplacements, trenches, barbed wire - all of it and more shall be built across the nation en masse as we move to turn Luxemburg into a nation-wide fortification. Never again shall we fall to French boots!"
LUX_host_german_exiles:0 "Settle German Exiles"
LUX_host_german_exiles_desc:0 "As more and more Germans find their way into our borders, we have begun to find a use for them - as settlers. Incentivizing these tourists, exiles, and other Germanics to settle down in Luxemburg and plant their roots shall be no small task, but doing so will only seek to speed up our efforts of total Germanization. Even if we must start displacing those of lesser, non-Teutonic blood to accommodate these noble travelers, we shall ensure they settle here, for they are our future, and everything we aspire to be."

LUX_new_army:0 "A New Luxembourgish Army"
LUX_new_army_desc:0 "In order to defend our newly sovereign nation, we will need an army to defend ourselves. Currently, our military is little more than just some militias and resistance groups hobbled together under a new banner. This shoddy reality must be changed, or else we will face our next conflict woefully unprepared."
LUX_ducal_army:0 "A Ducal Army"
LUX_ducal_army_desc:0 "Hearkening to the legacy of the old Grand Duchy and our military prowess during the time of the Holy Roman Empire, we shall create an organized and professional army for Luxembourg. No longer the era of pike and shot, we must adapt our old tactics to this new era of warfare we have been thrust into. If we do so, no foe will be able to withstand the might of our royal armies."
LUX_new_royal_guard:0 "Restore the Garde Grand-Ducale"
LUX_new_royal_guard_desc:0 "The ‘Grand Guard of the Duchy’ were the royal guard of the Crown as well as expert peacekeepers and veterans in urban warfare. We should reform this now defunct military order and set it up as the core of our new army. Here, this veteran legacy shall form the foundations for our new military reforms."
LUX_red_army:0 "A Red Army"
LUX_red_army_desc:0 "Copying the best aspects of the Internaionale’s expeditionary forces, we shall emulate these new hegemons of the world and put their tactics to good use defending our homeland. With their expertise guiding the way, our newly born army shall rise from the ragtag group of militias it is now into a highly professional and highly efficient military force."
LUX_red_guard:0 "Create the Garde Rouge de Luxembourg"
LUX_red_guard_desc:0 "Emulating but surpassing the old Royal Guard, this new ‘Red Guard’ shall defend our nation and our party at all costs. By drawing the best tactics and ideas from the old Garde Grand-Ducale without taking the pomp and ceremony, we shall create the perfect vanguard force to supplement our main army."
LUX_buy_planes:0 "Swarm the Skies"
LUX_buy_planes_desc:0 "By reaching out to our new allies, we will be able to purchase their surplus aeronautical equipment for use in our own burgeoning air force. With their help, we shall source all the planes we need in order to kickstart this new wing of the Luxembourgish military as we endeavor to fill the skies and blot out the sun with our air wings."
LUX_establish_airforce:0 "Establish a Luxembourgish Air Force"
LUX_establish_airforce_desc:0 "With an initial seed of equipment and airplanes to get us started, we have pushed forward to begin organizing our own domestic air force. With these flyboys overhead patrolling our skies, our men on the ground will not only feel more secure, but will also be able to count on the big guns when they are truly needed, making their job in protecting the nation a whole lot easier."
LUX_spy_networks:0 "The Spëtzeldéngscht"
LUX_spy_networks_desc:0 "Attached to our diplomatic corp but kept hidden, the Service de Renseignement de l'État Luxembourgeois, or Spëtzeldéngscht as it is known more colloquially, is our main intelligence agency. Charged with defending Luxembourg from any subversive threat, both foreign and domestic, these agents work night and day for the defense of the nation. We should expand their operations and grant them more funding so that they can better patrol the dark underbelly of the globe for our benefit."
LUX_radar:0 "Military Telecommunications"
LUX_radar_desc:0 "Our nation already has a great telecommunications network, primarily centered around CLR - the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion. However, their network is primarily used for commercial and public services. We should move to work with CLR and other organizations like it, forcing these firms to work with our military and to give us access to their systems. With these towers and relay stations under our management, we should be able to create a radar net over the nation, ensuring nothing enters our airspace without us knowing."

LUX_fp:0 "Looking Out From Luxembourg"
LUX_fp_desc:0 "With our political climate stabilized and our national direction chosen, it is finally time to figure out our own place on the world stage. With the remnants of Germany and her allies pulling us in one direction while the Internationale pulls us in another, it seems that yet again Luxembourg is stuck between a rock and a hard place. We must once again choose our direction at this new crossroads, with the entirety of the nation and possibly even the wider world hanging in the balance."

LUX_fp_int:0 "Pro-Internationale Politics"
LUX_fp_int_desc:0 "With our Socialist regime intact, it is only natural for us to drift towards the Internationale even further. We shall align our diplomatic ambitions, at least for now, for the good of the proletariat. Let us welcome the Internationale with open arms, and hope they do not get in our way."
LUX_socialist_benelux:0 "Towards a Socialist BeNeLux"
LUX_socialist_benelux_desc:0 "Uniting the Low Countries has long been an idea, but we shall be the ones to bring it to fruition! We shall approach the Netherlands, the Wallonians, and the Flemish, and work towards uniting our nations for the good of all within our distinct region."
LUX_eat_surrounding_land:0 "Demand Our Proletariat’s Clay"
LUX_eat_surrounding_land_desc:0 "All around us lies land stolen from us by foreign powers over the years. Whether it be the Germans, the Walloons, or even the French, the former lands of the Grand Duchy sit in foreign hands, and this cannot be allowed to stand. We shall reach out to each of these regimes and demand our rightful territory, or else! Let us hope they do not call our bluff..."
LUX_red_benelux:0 "Wrap the Low Countries in Red"
LUX_red_benelux_desc:0 "With the Low Countries now all under our control, we shall push to integrate these lands fully into our administration. A true, united, and fully Socialist BeNeLux union shall rise in our place - one ready to take on the rigours of the modern world head on as the Internationale stands behind us."

LUX_world_revolution:0 "Towards the World Revolution"
LUX_world_revolution_desc:0 "There is but one destiny for mankind - complete unity under one Red banner. Though most scoff at this dream, calling it delusion or madness, we see past these surface-level glances. We see the real truth that lies at the heart of humanity’s shared future. The World must be dyed Red, and we shall be the heralds, the champions, the crusaders of this global crimson dawn."
LUX_denounce_int:0 "Denounce the Internationale"
LUX_denounce_int_desc:0 "The Internationale is a failed alliance. They merely use the power of Socialism to oppress those who once oppressed them instead of riding past their own borders to liberate humanity as a whole.

lux.1.t:0 "Occupation of Luxembourg"
lux.1.d:0 "With our victories against Germany on their Western flank, we have come to control the area of Luxembourg. With our decision to not annex this plot of land, but instead to create an autonomous Socialist Republic there, General Henri Tanguy has been sent to administer the provisional government until a local Trade Union Congress can be established to organize elections. We wish Tanguy well on his new endeavor, and we shall watch this new Socialist Luexmbourger state with great interest."
lux.1.a:0 "Another red pearl to add to our collection!"
lux.1.b:0 "Nous voulons rester ce que nous sommes! (Play as Luxembourg)"

lux.100.t:0 "A Crimson Dawn for Luxembourg"
lux.100.d:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles and a quick democratic referendum, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg joined the Kaiserreich as its newest constituent state. With the beloved Marie-Adélaïde remaining on her throne as Grand Duchess, Luxembourg took their new national situation in stride, and reaped the benefits of integration with Germany immensely. \n\nOver the following decades, much changed for the Duchy. The Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde died in 1924, and was replaced by her sister Charlotte. Furthermore, Luxembourg was rapidly industrialized, aided by its rich local iron and aluminum deposits, even rising to become the seat of illustrious and wealthy German industrial firms such as Deutsch-Luxemburgische Bergwerks-und Hütten-AG and Vereinigte Stahlhütten Burbach-Eich-Düdelingen, which fueled the nation’s rapid growth and brought even greater wealth to its people. However, this industrialization became a double-edged sword, for Socialist and Social Democratic ideals became popular in the region among the masses of factory workers, and with the start of the Second Weltkrieg, pro-Internationale militias and resistance groups were a common sight. \n\nFollowing the war, Luxembourg now finds itself under new management - made an autonomous socialist republic under the watch of a French-led occupational force commanded by General Henri Tenguy. General Tenguy, nicknamed Rol-Tenguy during his time aiding the Socialist Resistance in Luxembourg during the war, now leads the provisional government until the newly established Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vu Lëtzebuerg - or Syndicalist Trade Union Congress of Luxembourg - can fully organize a new administration and first elections. However, with monarchist elements still loyal to the Grand Duchess, republican resistance guided by Pierre Dupong, and the pro-German ‘Volksdeutsche Bewegung’ all on the prowl and waiting for their moment to strike, it would seem this new red pearl of the Internationale is not as welcoming to their red ‘liberation’ as they thought it would be. With this tense political stage set, anything could be in the cards for this industrialized jewel of the Lowlands."
lux.100.a:0 "Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn!"

lux.2.t:0 "The First Meeting of the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress"
lux.2.d:0 "With our new people’s republic established under the guidance of Paris and their watchdog General Tanguy, the time has come for our new legislative body - the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress vu Lëtzebuerg - to determine the fate of the nation. With only Socialist parties being allowed in the running, the race has been narrowed down to three main candidates. The face of the Kongress and of our nation’s Leftist movement itself is Louis Charles Marx, who leads the Syndikalist Partei vu Lëtzebuerg in line with traditional French Orthodox Syndicalism and has amassed much of the support of the congress. Opposing the SPL is Michel Rasquin’s Lëtzebuerger Sozialistesch Aarbechterpartei - or the Luxembourg Socialist Worker’s Party - which stands as a broad coalition of various Social Democrats, Democratic Socialists, and other moderates, and Dominique Urbany’s Revolutionär Sozialistesch Partei - an Internationalist party inspired by the Tuckachevky and the failed Trotsky. With each candidate standing in a decent position before the race, it is any man’s game. With the final delegates within the Kongress passing their votes, it would seem that..."

lux.2.b:0 "Dominique Urbany and his RSP seizes the nation for Internationalist Totalism!"
lux.2.c:0 "Michel Rasquin and his band of moderate Socialists in LSAP win out!"

lux.3.t:0 "Counter-Revolutionary Militias Organize"
lux.3.d:0 "The French have abandoned us, with General Tanguy and the last of his men pulling out and heading back home to Paris. In their absences, our meager Red Guard - itself nothing more than our resistance militias from the war rebranded - is all that stands in the way between our new red republic and the wolves that circle us even now. Wasting no time, numerous counter-revolutionary groups have already begun to organize. Among them are numerous different monarchists, republicans, and reactionaries who would all love nothing more than to see our people’s republic burn! Should we move out to crush these forces now before they can grow out of hand for our small military force, or shall we bide our time and reinforce - hoping that they do not strike while we are unprepared..."
lux.3.a:0 "Nothing to be alarmed about. We must focus on strengthening our own forces first."
lux.3.b:0 "Crush them, just to be safe."

lux.4.t:0 "Counter-Revolutionary Militias Attempt Coup"
lux.4.d:0 "With our decision to leave the reactionaries alone, they have only festered and grown in number, and now they have banded together to topple our people’s republic once and for all. With their unstable coalition unified against us, we have little hope to actually repel these rebels, but we must try anyway, for if not all that we have done here will be for nothing. With our backs to the wall and with our heads held high, we shall face these traitors of the Revolution! We shall be victorious, or we shall dine with our foes in Hell!"
lux.4.a:0 "Against all odds, we have repelled the reactionaries and saved our red republic!"

lux.5.t:0 "French Forces Pull Out"
lux.5.d:0 "With the Syndikalistesche Gewerkschaftskongress solidifying its hold on the nation, General Tanguy and his occupational forces have announced their decision to return to France. Stating that the need for the provisional government is over now that the Kongress can stand on its own two feet, and ignoring rumors of the growing counter-revolutionary threat. Regardless of how safe and secure our new people’s republic truly is, the French are leaving anyway, and soon we shall be left alone to face whatever threats come our way..."
lux.5.a:0 "We didn’t need those guys anyway."

lux.6.t:0 "Reactionary Cells Attempt a Coup in Luxembourg"
lux.6.d:0 "News has come in from our puppet government in Luxembourg City reporting that counter-revolutionary elements have banded together in order to topple the infantile people’s republic we set-up there following our victory against Germany. Though we poured much time and investment into the ‘Luxembourg Project,’ with our current finances and military situation, it does not seem practical to once again try to prop up a government so clearly hated by its own people. However, these lost souls could just be trying to introduce Socialism all wrong, and they might just require our expert hand in the matter. Regardless, our decision won’t matter much in the grand scheme of our wider aspirations, for it is only Luxembourg..."
lux.6.a:0 "We cannot be bothered with something so trivial at a time like this."
lux.6.b:0 "Send Tanguy and his men back to the old Duchy!"

lux.7.t:0 "Luxembourg at a Crossroads"
lux.7.d:0 "Our counter-revolution has proven successful, with the vile Socialist regime meeting its fitting end at the edge of a rifle barrel. With our victory, some clemency has been offered to the more moderate Socialists - especially those among Rasquin’s NL - but for the large part, all other red traitors have been jailed or killed, with many more fleeing into exile in France. With these ruffians finally gone, the heroes and leading figures of our counter-revolution have come together to determine the fate of the nation. Holding a Kongress of their own in the grand hall of Schlass Fëschbech - or Berg Castle - these former enemies of the state now shall decide its future. Calling for the varied delegates - among them being pre-revolution politicians, military and resistance figures, nobility, and various other parties representing the Luxembourgish people. The two main camps of this debate have coalesced around the Grand Duchess Charlotte, who is supported by both avid monarchists and desperate republicans hoping to coax their sovereign into reintroducing democracy, and Damian Kratzenberg, a highschool teacher turned reactionary paramilitary leader who heads the viciously pro-German Volksdeutsche Bewegung. In the hands of one of these two groups, the future of Luxembourg lies. Now it is only up to the people to decide."
lux.7.a:0 "Standing upon her legacy, the Grand Duchess wins over her people."
lux.7.b:0 "The VdB’s popularity among the people carry them to victory."

lux.8.t:0 "The Question of Democracy"
lux.8.d:0 "With the post-revolutionary Kongress deciding that Grand Duchess Charlotte should remain upon her throne as a sovereign monarch, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has been reborn. Now, in order to move forward with our nation-building plans, a final decision must be made about the future of the nation. With her republican allies still clamoring for democracy, she could very well restore democracy to its fullest, stepping back as monarch and relegating herself to an entirely ceremonial role. However, though this would appease these republican sycophants, it would be a slap in the face to every other supporter of hers who joined her cause during the counter-revolution due to her undying devotion to Luxembourgish tradition. To appease these groups, and possibly even her own ambition, Grand Duchess Charlotte could instead push forward as planned to restore the balanced, modern parliamentary monarchy her people are used to. Alternatively, the Grand Duchess could even take this further given her current position of dominance, and push to consolidate all executive power within her hands as a true absolute monarch. Whatever her choice be now, all of Luxembourg and its destiny now lie solely within her hands."
lux.8.a:0 "Listen to our people and restore full democratic elections!"
lux.8.b:0 "Pay lip service to democracy while establishing a more modern monarchy."
lux.8.c:0 "All power shall lie within the hands of the Grand Duchess!"

lux.9.t:0 "Our First Post-Revolution Elections"
lux.9.d:0 "Listening to our pleas, the Grand Duchess has moved to reintroduce democracy back to the people of Luxembourg, finally allowing their voices to be heard. With this announcement, the head of our government-in-exile Pierre Dupong has moved to organize new elections. Drawing all the right-wing elements within the nation not already fallen in with the VdB, Dupong has reestablished the Rietspartei, or the Party of the Right, seeking to bring Chrisitan Conservatism and monitored Capitalism back to our state. Opposing him for support among the center and right is Eugène Schaus, whose newly remade Liberal Liga shares many of the same beliefs that the Rietspartei holds while strongly pushing for Classical Liberalism, Secularism, and a freer market instead. Opposing these two moderate groups is Marcel Cahen’s Radikal Liberal Partei, who stands for Progressivism, Secularism, and Social Capitalism. Finally, running as the dark horse candidate is Michel Rasquin, who since the counter-revolution has denounced his extremist views, purging his old LSAP of radicals and rebranding it as ‘Néi Lénk’ - or the New Left. Rasquin is still a dedicated Socialist at heart, but now champions for Social Democracy and moderate reformism over revolutionary action. With the parties set and the votes being counted, it's only a matter of time before our new national direction is determined through democracy,"
lux.9.a:0 "Pierre Dupong’s Rietspartei unsurprisingly takes the win."
lux.9.b:0 "Eugène Schaus’ Liberal Liga seizes the day."
lux.9.c:0 "Marcel Cahen’s Radikal Liberal Partei comes out on top."
lux.9.3:0 "Michel Rasquin’s reformed and de-radicalized Néi Lénk wins the day."

lux.10.t:0 "Luxembourg Proposes a Union"
lux.10.d:0 "The President of [LUX.getname] has sent a delegation to our capital bearing a newly-minted offer of union between the nations of the Low Countries. Citing the need to better protect ourselves and our interests from the preying Super Powers, their President [LUX.getleader] has practically demanded that we unify for the sake of preserving our shared yet unique identities while maintaining our sovereignty. How shall we reply?"
lux.10.a:0 "We push forward for a brighter, redder future - together."
lux.10.b:0 "Are they mad?!"

lux.11.t:0 "Unity Offer Accepted"
lux.11.d:0 "It seems our delegation was met with warm welcomes and open ears, for our envoys have returned with great news - the foreign office of [target.getname] has agreed to our offer of unification. With their acceptance, [target.getname] shall soon fully integrate with our current administration, bringing the Low Countries one step close to total unification."
lux.11.a:0 "Stäerkt duerch Eenheet!"

lux.12.t:0 "Unity Offer Rejected"
lux.12.d:0 "It seems our delegation was met with jeers and derision, for our envoys have returned with solemn news - their foreign office has denied our offer of unification. Now, with their denial, we are left with two choices. We can either back down and pursue ambitions elsewhere, or we can declare war and march into their capital to teach them the error of their ways."
lux.12.a:0 "Damn! We have no choice but to back down."
lux.12.b:0 "Then we shall decide this through war!"

lux.14.t:0 "Luxembourg Demands Territory"
lux.14.d:0 "The small state of Luxembourg that we liberated from the Kaiserreich has now come asking for territorial concessions. Demanding that we and our allies cede over any lands that they rightfully claim - being the old lands of the former Grand Duchy - Luxembourg has agreed to pay handsomely for them. Though it is just Luxembourg, they are still our hard-won lands. What shall we do?"
lux.14.a:0 "Grant them their silly little demands."
lux.14.b:0 "We have fought too hard to simply give up this land!"

lux.15.t:0 "France Accepts"
lux.15.d:0 "Surprisingly, France has completely bent over and allowed us to take our claimed lands. Even now, these territories are being officially transferred over to our control, and soon our administration will have to figure out how to integrate them. Until then, we shall just enjoy this bloodless victory for what it truly is - a miracle!"
lux.15.a:0 "We welcome these lost lands with open arms."

lux.16.t:0 "France Rejects"
lux.16.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, France has categorically denied any and all territorial claims and ambitions our state held within their lands. This slap in the face leaves us with two very clear decisions to choose from - we can either accept this loss for what it is and walk away, or we can ride into Paris and burn down their precious ‘City of Lights’ for daring to stand in the way of Luxembourg and our glorious ambitions!"
lux.16.a:0 "Then we shall march on Paris and salt its earth!"
lux.16.b:0 "We must back down."

lux.17.t:0 "Rejoin the Reich"
lux.17.d:0 "With the reconstitution of the Kaiserreich, the debate as to whether or not we should rejoin it has once again begun to rage. Though we once voted to be a constituent state within the Reich, a lot has changed since 1919. Should we move to rejoin Germany, revalidating the old referendum, or shall we simply accept our new, independent reality?"
lux.17.a:0 "The referendum is still binding! Move for total integration!"
lux.17.b:0 "We shall face our new destiny independently."

lux.18.t:0 "Our Rightful Clay in Germany"
lux.18.d:0 "With Germany’s liberation finalized, the Kaiserreich has once more risen in Central Europe. Now, with their revival out of the way, many within our administration have pushed for the return of our territorial claims, particularly around the Rhein. Though it may be a lot to ask of our newly liberated allies, this may be the only time we can ask for these territories with any hope of them saying yes. What shall we do?"
lux.18.a:0 "Send the demand at once!"
lux.18.b:0 "We cannot ask so much of our newly-liberated allies."

lux.19.t:0 "Luxembourg Demands Territorial Concessions"
lux.19.d:0 "With our Kaisereich reestablished and with Wilhelm back on the throne, it would seem that our luck is finally beginning to change. However, one last loose end still hangs from our liberation. Luxembourg, claiming land along the Rhein and near the Ruhr, has come asking our newly-rebuilt regime to hand over their ‘rightful’ territory to the Luxembourgish government. Any other time, such a request would only be met with outrage. However, given that the Luxembourgers led the liberation efforts to save our empire, perhaps we could shave off some small sliver of our land to appease them. What shall be our response?"
lux.19.a:0 "They saved our nation, it is the least we could do."
lux.19.b:0 "Are they mad?! The Kaiserreich remains indivisible!"

lux.20.t:0 "Germany Accepts Our Territorial Demands"
lux.20.d:0 "Shocking most within the nation, the Kaiserreich has decided to graciously and peacefully hand over our claimed territories. With this decision, we now have access to the Rheinland and its riches without restriction. We shall utilize this new living space to great effect as we build up the new Luxembourgish state."
lux.20.a:0 "One step closer to a greater Luxembourg!"

lux.21.t:0 "Germany Refuses"
lux.21.d:0 "To no surprise, the returning German hegemon has denied us our demands of Greater Luxembourg. After all we’ve done for them, we should have seen such treachery coming. While our troops may not be eager to fight their recent allies so soon, we should attack Germany while they are still rebuilding their fractured nation. Otherwise, we would surely crumble under their manpower and industrial might."
lux.21.a:0 "Perhaps we are content with our domain as it is."
lux.21.b:0 "Hit them while their pants are down! War!"

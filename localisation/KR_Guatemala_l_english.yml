### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JOSE_MARIA_ORELLANA_DESC:0 "Orellana's military dictatorship beginning in 1921 has grown stagnant, with both him and his cabinet exhausted with constantly having to deal with protests against his presidency, social uprisings, and people wishing for true democracy to be returned. His main focus of building the economy and fighting illiteracy has also begun to slow down over time due to some sort of opposition from one side or another. Guatemala grows tired and demands change which Orellana cannot bring in the countries current state, and a shakeup could make him meet his undesirable fate..."
POLITICS_UBICO_NAPOLEON_DESC:0 "Born to Guatemala's upper class in 1878, Jorge Ubico Castañeda has long held a silver spoon in his hand. Receiving private tutoring as a boy and higher education overseas in Europe and the United States, his pathway to high success was paved at a young age. At 19, he joined the Guatemalan army upon being granted a commission due to his familial ties, and began his meteoric rise to the top from there. All along the way, the young Ubico looked to one man as his inspiration: Napoleon Bonaparte, deposed Emperor of France. As he grew older and achieved his dreams and more, Ubico began to take this fascination even farther, actively modeling his own image and mannerisms after the ‘Little Colonel.’ Now, ruling over all of Central America, Ubico has taken this obsession one step farther, fashioning himself as Jorge I, Emperor of Central America, while modeling this Lating American state on the now-collapsed First French Empire. Frequently remarking to his companions on how similar he and the long-dead Frenchman are, both in looks and personality, many within his cabinet have taken issue with this ‘admiration.’ Nonetheless, they can do little to stop this ‘Little Napoleon of the Tropics’, for absolute power is already within his reach..."

guatemala.1.t:0 "Intro to Guatemala"
guatemala.1.d:0 "Guatemala's political chaos started in 1898, when Manuel Estrada Cabrera came into power. Cabrera's “Liberal” party had a deep control over the government, with all elections up until 1920 being rigged towards the Liberal party under Cabrera. This period also vastly increased the influence of the United Fruit Company, an American owned business focused on increasing the amount of exports towards America for cheaper prices.\n\nThis changed in 1920, when the Liberal party faced extreme opposition following earthquakes in 1918 that destroyed the industry Cabrera had setup. His lack of response resulted in the Conservatives within the country forming the Unionist Party, with the people running the party consisting of José Azmitia, Tácito Molina, Eduardo Camacho, Julio Bianchi and Emilio Escamilla, while also being supported by the Catholic church within Guatemala.\n\nThe Unionist Party prepared the “Three-Fold Act”, which was the founding policy of the party, and they distributed these in Guatemala City on the New Year of 1920. This led to an extreme rise of the popularity of the Unionists, with protests occurring outside the capital on March 11th, 1920, with the crowd being fired upon and the populace left more angered than before. The final straw was in 1920, when Adrián Vidaurre, President of the National Assembly, declared Cabrera unfit to rule and deposed him, though still facing fierce resistance from Cabrera's supporters. They thereby made Carlos Herrera President of Guatemala.\n\nHerrara balanced a very careful political tightrope due to him having Liberal aligned views while representing the Unionist Party. This tightrope snapped in 1921, when he critically upset the Liberal party by refusing to offer concessions the UFC, resulting in a military coup led by José María Orellana. He represented the needs and demands of the Liberal Party, offering concessions to the UFC the following year.\n\nThe political situation has completely stagnated since then, with Orellana ruling over his regime while balancing the needs of both the left and right. Guatemala now stands frozen..."
guatemala.1.a:0 "Orellana is eternal."

guatemala.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Us!"
guatemala.2.d:0 "Black Monday has hit the United States, making their economic recession even worse. Ripples are being felt all across Central America, our crops remain unsold and US companies shrink in size to avoid bankruptcy."
guatemala.2.a:0 "What will this mean for Guatemala?"

guatemala.3.t:0 "Legal Issues"
guatemala.3.d:0 "Several peasants sued the United Fruit Company and certain provincial governors on flimsy grounds such as having their land sold by other parties without their knowledge, local governors seizing their land for the UFC without sensible reason, and ignoring the last wills for heirless people. It is obvious that the socialists pressured these peasants, instructing them to push their claims and helping them with the legal fees."
guatemala.3.a:0 "Listen to their pleas, return the land and try to do something about corruption."
guatemala.3.b:0 "These are surely just made up excuses!"

guatemala.4.t:0 "The American Civil War"
guatemala.4.t_nocw:0 "America Stabilizes"
guatemala.4.d:0 "The American Civil war has broken out! Our biggest trading partner disappeared almost overnight. UFC officials are scrambling to save as much as they can in the chaos, selling off assets to stabilise their situation. Their support for Orellana has weakened considerably; a dark cloud now looms on the horizon of Guatemala."
guatemala.4.d_nocw:0 "Much to our shock, it seems like the situation in the United States is stabilizing. Unfortunately, it seems that without the specter of war in the US, the Guatemalan populace no longer has a diversion against Orellana's own unpopularity. As the US President looks inwards, it seems that the regime in Guatemala has found itself utterly alone."
guatemala.4.a:0 "Guatemala will survive."

guatemala.5.t:0 "Letter of the 311"
guatemala.5.d:0 "A group of democrats and socialists, mainly composed of university students, wrote a letter designated to President Orellana asking for his resignation and for free elections to start as soon as possible. Orellana knows his support dwindled and the democratic movement militarised and started talks with the socialists to declare open revolt to bring 'freedom' to Guatemala, this letter just being the tipping point of the tensions. If the government rejects this apparently 'heart-felt' letter coming from the future of Guatemala, civil war is all but inevitable."
guatemala.5.a:0 "Start preparing for elections as soon as possible, to avert disaster."
guatemala.5.b:0 "This is just a socialist conspiracy! Guatemala will not be corrupted!"

guatemala.6.t:0 "Ubico's Coup"
guatemala.6.d:0 "Seeing the weakness of Orellana and the inevitable elections that would bring socialists into government, the popular hardline general Jorge Ubico Castañeda has entered the capital with his loyal army and deposed Orellana. As soon as the news hit the country, the democratic-socialist coalition, the National Progress Party, started taking direct control of several cities and declared Ubico's regime illegitimate, starting a civil war. Some of the more moderate people, appalled by Ubico's power grab, joined their cause."
guatemala.6.a:0 "Ubico will save us from socialism!"

guatemala.7.t:0 "Ubico's Speech to the People"
guatemala.7.d:0 "Several days after the coup, as he managed to stabilise his rule in the capital, Ubico gave a speech to the people of Ciudad de Guatemala:\n'Fellow Guatemalans, I come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason. Let no Guatemalan deny the perils of our time. While we battle one another, divided by the petty strife of our common history, the tide of a greater conflict is turning against us, threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished. It is time for us as individuals to set aside our long-standing feuds and unite. The tides of an unwinnable war are upon us, and we must seek refuge upon higher ground, lest we be swept away by the flood.\nThe United States of America is no more! Whatever semblance of unity and protection it once provided is a phantom, a memory. With our enemies left unchecked, who will you turn to for protection? The devastation wrought by the socialists is self-evident. We have seen our cities occupied by the National Progress Party. We have seen firsthand our friends and loved ones shackled by them. Unprecedented and unimaginable though they may be, these are the signs of our time.\nThe time has come, my fellow Guatemalans, to rally to a new banner. In unity lies strength. Out of the many we shall forge an indivisible whole, answering only to a single throne, and from that throne, I shall watch over you.'\nThe booing of the supporters of the NPP were drowned in the standing ovations of the crowds."
guatemala.7.a:0 "We will fight for Guatemala! For Ubico!"

guatemala.8.t:0 "Opening Strategies"
guatemala.8.d:0 "As the chaos throughout the country subsided, vast areas have ended up controlled by the National Progress Party. They are trying to expand their position in an aggressive manner, and underground cells have formed in most cities that still are nominally loyal to us. What would be the best course of action?"
guatemala.8.a:0 "Secure the temporary borders, not one mile will be ceded!"
guatemala.8.b:0 "Focus on rooting out opposition in loyalist lands."

guatemala.9.t:0 "Choosing a Target"
guatemala.9.d:0 "[getgua8], the military staff had to decide their strategy for the war. Would they advance directly on the mountainous makeshift rebel capital of Quetzaltenango, ending the rebellion fast but in a very costly assault, or try to starve the rebels by moving onwards to Ciudad de Belize and then cut them off from the Mexican border, isolating them?"
guatemala.9.a:0 "They will fall like flies, onward to Quetzaltenango!"
guatemala.9.b:0 "We shouldn't waste honourable Guatemalan lives in vain, starve the rebels into submission."

gua_8_d1:0 "After we secured our borders"
gua_8_d2:0 "After Ciudad de Guatemala and other urban centres were cleared of any NPP presence"

guatemala.10.t:0 "The Siege of Ciudad de Belize"
guatemala.10.d:0 "As the rebel defenses are overstretched, the concentrated blow to their main port in Belize went by with no issues. We registered barely any losses, and already started marching to the Mexican border to encircle whatever remains of the rebel forces, as their resources grow scarcer. While it is obvious to all parties involved that Mexico heavily assists the rebellion, the spineless socialists will surely not declare war to protect their proteges, even when their means of supporting the rebels will disappear."
guatemala.10.a:0 "The rebels know their demise is imminent."

guatemala.11.t:0 "The Assault on the Capital"
guatemala.11.d:0 "As our troops were finishing securing the border with Mexico, the rebels moved against Ciudad de Guatemala! This time it was them pouring all their resources into a final attack to make us flee from the capital and break our will. With a good chunk of our forces guarding the western border, this fight will be a hard one. Some generals even suggested letting them in the capital, fighting them in the streets, buying time for our forces to occupy the now virtually defenseless rebel land."
guatemala.11.a:0 "We will never let them enter Ciudad de Guatemala!"
guatemala.11.b:0 "It would be better for our long term goals to dye our capital red with blood."

guatemala.12.t:0 "The End of the Civil War"
guatemala.12.d:0 "After weeks of fighting in the streets of Ciudad de Guatemala, our troops managed to return to the capital, encircling the rebels, forcing their surrender. Our victorious president called for a parade the very next day. Through the bloody streets of Guatemala, the troops paraded valiantly, holding the Guatemalan flag up high, to the cheers of the people, who can taste peace at last. [getgua12d]"
guatemala.12.a:0 "[getgua12a]"
gua_12_d2:0 "The government started working towards making the civil war just a painful memory, and continue the path to a better Guatemala, as they did for the last 18 years, all under the guiding hand of Orellana, our dear president."
gua_12_d1:0 "The government already started working on plans to help the country heal and recover, preparing to enter a new era, all under the guiding hand of Ubico."
gua_12_a2:0 "Long live our President!"
gua_12_a1:0 "Peace, at last. Praise Ubico!"

guatemala.13.t:0 "A Statue for Our Victor"
guatemala.13.d:0 "As Ciudad de Guatemala is being rebuilt, the people (mainly high-class aristocracy) expressed their earnest desire for a statue dedicated to Ubico, to immortalise his role as the man who stopped the socialists from ruining Guatemala. It would be built in the likeness of the heroes of old, with Ubico on a fine steed, holding his saber forward."
guatemala.13.a:0 "We are truly grateful."

guatemala.14.t:0 "Rebuilding Ciudad de Guatemala"
guatemala.14.d:0 "As Ciudad de Guatemala was badly damaged by the final skirmish with the rebels, a big reconstruction project has commenced. Ubico wants to make the roads better and wider, to prepare Guatemala to be a capital for a larger Central America. However, more skeptical members of the government proposed a more sensible plan, to increase the defenses of the capital, to never again have such a bloodbath happen inside its borders."
guatemala.14.a:0 "Guatemala will never again be threatened, rebuild it with grandeur!"
guatemala.14.b:0 "Better to be conservative and protect the capital from further threats."

guatemala.15.t:0 "Civil War!"
guatemala.15.d:0 "The National Progress Party has used the days since the letter to prepare themselves to declare open revolt! They managed to take over Quetzaltenango and Ciudad de Belize, with most of the land in between them and the Mexican border. The government is in disarray trying to come up with a plan to stabilise the situation and defeat the rebels."
guatemala.15.a:0 "Rebel scum!"

guatemala.16.t:0 "Disaster!"
guatemala.16.d:0 "Quetzaltenango proved to be a formidable fortress. The loyalist armies were bogged down in its defensive layers and were incurring much heavier losses than the rebels. Feeling desperate, the government sent more and more troops to help the siege. After the defenses of Ciudad de Guatemala were thinned enough, the NPP members hiding in the city came out and managed to take out the lightly protected leadership! The higher echelons fell into anarchy, with most of them escaping while the NPP took hold of the country. Hearing this news, the army, tired after the fighting, held the white flag."
guatemala.16.a:0 "Long live Guatemalan Freedom!"

guatemala.17.t:0 "Victory!"
guatemala.17.d:0 "The fighting was brutal. The rebels made Quetzaltenango into a formidable fortress. We incurred heavy losses. We needed to pledge all our reserves to the fight. The capital was virtually undefended. However, we succeeded. We broke through their lines yesterday, and captured their leaders. As most rebels were in this city, the rebellion was effectively broken. After a brief respite, the army marched in the rest of the country and made sure all the remaining pockets were defeated."
guatemala.17.a:0 "Guatemala finds peace, at last!"

guatemala.18.t:0 "The Cost of Pride"
guatemala.18.d:0 "Refusing to let the rebels taint the capital, the defenders rallied in front of Ciudad de Guatemala. The battle was a bloody one, with many loses on both sides, but the numerical superiority of the rebels won over the smaller defending army. When it was clear that the rebels would win, the government escaped the capital, leaving it open to be liberated by the NPP. Hearing this news, the rest of the army, scattered around the Mexican border, agreed to lay down their arms and swear allegiance to the new government."
guatemala.18.a:0 "Freedom, at last!"

guatemala.19.t:0 "The Fate of El Salvador"
guatemala.19.d:0 "El Salvador has turned red! While we managed to put down the rebellion in our land, it seems they have failed. Our government has decided to prepare for war to liberate our brethren!"
guatemala.19.a:0 "To Arms!"

guatemala.20.t:0 "A Policy on Education"
guatemala.20.d:0 "How should our government tackle education issues? Even if Orellana, the ex-president of Guatemala, did do much to tackle the illiteracy, he obviously has not gone far enough."
guatemala.20.a:0 "Enforce strict curriculum on the value of the working class, and the evils of aristocracy."
guatemala.20.b:0 "Leave a high degree of autonomy to each teacher, and promote meritocracy."

guatemala.21.t:0 "Dealing with the UFC"
guatemala.21.d:0 "The UFC has been the source of many issues to the stability of Guatemala. What would be the best way to handle it?"
guatemala.21.a:0 "Nationalise it."
guatemala.21.b:0 "Buy off enough land from it so it will not be a dominant presence in the country."

guatemala.22.t:0 "The Split"
guatemala.22.d:0 "Today, the NPP has ended. The tensions between Ortiz's Revolutionary Action Party and González's Union Party had reached the breaking point, and small skirmishes have broken out in the capital, months after the civil war that scarred the country. Which party will come on top?"
guatemala.22.a:0 "The Partido Acción Revolucionaria!"
guatemala.22.b:0 "The Partido Unionista!"

guatemala.23.t:0 "The Counter-Revolution!"
guatemala.23.d:0 "Ubico returned with an army of mercenaries paid for by the UFC! He landed in Belize and started to march towards the capital, while we're trying to prepare defenses to meet him in battle, even though we're very weakened due to the previous civil war."
guatemala.23.a:0 "Ubico defeats the government!"
guatemala.23.b:0 "Ubico is stopped, the revolution is saved!"

guatemala.69.t:0 "Naval Disaster"
guatemala.69.d:0 "As the Guatemalan navy finally had more than one lonely ship, they were sent out to do formation training. However, the sheer incompetence of the newly trained sailors resulted in one of the ships hitting the other during targeting training, forcing it to capsize. Fearful of an adverse reaction from the people that so much money has gone to waste, Ubico's propaganda machine tried to spin it as a reenactment of the battle of Trafalgar."
guatemala.69.a:0 "That’s an... interesting turn of events."

guatemala.100.t:0 "Nobody Had the Guts to Leave the Temple!"
guatemala.100.d:0 "The legacy of extravagance and hedonism that president Cabrera embodies still remains scattered throughout Guatemala in the form of Minervan Temples. These buildings were used for Fiestas Minervalias, a holiday of Cabrera's own design. There were children singing, dances, and very unchristian attractions to behold in those days. Now the temples are deserted, and local priests ensure that no festivities are held. This would be the end of their use, if not for our inventive government. They have proposed we convert these halls of vice into baseball fields for children, or build them up into housing. The right would prefer to see them as baseball fields, while the left sees our housing issue as important enough to build up."
guatemala.100.a:0 "Baseball Fields."
guatemala.100.b:0 "Houses."

guatemala.101.t:0 "Conflicts in the Unionist Party"
guatemala.101.d:0 "Today, a faction of the Unionist Party led José Azmitia and another led by Lázaro Chacón González have entered into an open conflict due to disagreements over the power of the President in the country. While González defends a more centralized state that gives more power to the president, Azmitia fears that this will just turn González into just another dictator for Guatemala, and their differences have finally spilled over to their followers that have openly clashed. However, both men had a meeting and have made joint public statement claiming they have reconciled their differences in order to keep the country up and running. It is not clear however if they have truly reconciled or they are just banding together out of necessity..."
guatemala.101.a:0 "Let's hope they have truly reconciled."

guatemala.102.t:0 "Furthering of Central American Thought"
guatemala.102.d:0 "One of the main objectives of the Unionist party has been since its inception to reinforce the idea of a Central American way of thinking, as well as establishing Guatemala as a key player in the independence of Central America as a whole. While the process to introduce these concepts will be slow, we're starting to see the first signs of improvement in our schools, where now many remember Guatamala as the leader of the Central American independence movement."
guatemala.102.a:0 "The Unionistas are achieving their goals."

guatemala.103.t:0 "Dealing with Arévalo"
guatemala.103.d:0 "With our alliance with the PAR now being broken, we have to deal with the remains of the PPN that kept us together. Juan Jose Arévalo, leader of the PPN and the man who tried to keep the PU and the PAR together against authoritarianism now stands questioned by his actions during such times of crisis. While he has certainly helped us to strengthen our position and take over power, he also provided aid for the PAR, even sometimes taking their side on internal arguments during our coalition days, and he might have flocked to their side if they had taken over instead of us. It is for this that many in our party are distrustful of Arévalo, and demand us to exile him from the country as a traitor. What should we do?"
guatemala.103.a:0 "Exile him, he has no place here."
guatemala.103.b:0 "We all make mistakes, He is still an Ally."

guatemala.104.t:0 "Dr. John Cutler Offers to Experiment on Guatemalan Citizens for Cash"
guatemala.104.d:0 "A call from one Dr. John Cutler came in today requesting a meeting with the president. Seeing no harm a meeting was granted, and what must be one of the most fearful yet interesting propositions to be delivered in Guatemalan history. Dr. Cutler is a senior member of the US Public Health Service, an authority on the prevention of disease. He offers to test the effects of penicillin on preventing syphilis on a select group of Guatemalans. The reason Guatemala was selected, as claimed by Cutler, is because our people live in isolated communities that can be assured to not spread venereal disease very far. While this offer and the payment are attractive, one has to wonder why Cutler is so willing to import medicine at such a great cost."
guatemala.104.a:0 "Get Down With the Sickness."
guatemala.104.b:0 "Outrageous! Get out of here."

guatemala.105.t:0 "Introducing Miss Chiquita"
guatemala.105.d:0 "The banana as foodstuffs is no longer an exotic good to American buyers. This was expected after several decades of business. What isn't expected is competition from the likes of Dole in Hawaii to stir the pot in his favour. We commissioned Dik Browne to design a mascot for our banana division that will recapture the attention of young people. Her name is Miss Chiquita, and her song and dance now adorn radio broadcasts and newspapers across America. Sales are up as well."
guatemala.105.a:0 "Even the Jingle works."

guatemala.106.t:0 "Phantom Assassins Plot Against Ubico!"
guatemala.106.d:0 "A plot to assassinate our beloved Ubico has been found out by our intelligence service today. It detailed an extremely elaborate plan to infiltrate the Casa Crema and poison The President. However, our intelligence service hasn't been able to identify the perpetrators yet, and as the rumours of the conspiracy have conveniently reached the press, we need to choose a scapegoat to blame for the scandal."
guatemala.106.a:0 "The Socialists are behind this."

french_guatemala.1.d:0 "The Emperor, his army and his loyal subjects succeeded in securing Central America from all those who attacked our legitimate territory, from socialist revolutionaries to nationalist insurgents to liberal reformers, all united in their hatred of our Emperor. Now that we have defeated these pests, we can rest easy, however the question of the future of our Empire arises and our Emperor must make a choice that will be decisive for the nation.\n\nTwo choices are available to us, either we decide to create an Empire modeled on the one built by Napoleon I, the idol of our Emperor, as we initially planned, however Ubico also admires the Bonapartes as a whole, including Napoleon III, the nephew of Napoleon I and the leader of the Second French Empire, we could choose to model our regime on the state created by this venerable man, an empire that would be less militarized, more social and liberal but just as glorious.\n\nUbico is the only one who can choose, and he will decide in the end that..."

french_guatemala.2.t:0 "What Power for the Legislature?"
french_guatemala.2.d:0 "With our decision to create a Liberal Empire comes the creation of a legislature that has the task of assisting Emperor Ubico in the administration of his vast domain. This legislature is based on that of the Second French Empire, and is composed of an Upper House, the Senate, and a Lower House, the Legislative Body.\n\nThese two chambers are elected by direct universal male suffrage by the citizens of the Empire who are over 20 years of age. Of course, several parties will have the right to run for office, but we have also taken over the concept of the 'official candidate' of the Second Empire, who benefits from advantages during their campaign as well as from a great visibility assured by the State, assuring us a comfortable majority in the chambers.\n\nHowever, a question that comes up more and more frequently is: what will be the real powers of the two chambers? Some of the Emperor's advisors have expressed their support for a Senate and a Legislative Body that would only have honorary powers and therefore would only be representative, while others express their desire to have chambers with legislative power, but with the creation of a special right of veto, which is only possessed by the Emperor himself and which he can use as he pleases, which will limits the powers of the chambers.\n\nUbico has considered both proposals and is now ready to make a choice."

french_guatemala.3.d:0 "It was a dark day we learned the fall of the legitimate French government of Algiers, as much for Emperor Ubico as for his subjects, our brothers had fallen once again against the reds thirsty for blood and exploitation. \n\nHowever, Ubico is not the kind of man to leave his brothers alone against the enemy! Upon hearing the news, the Emperor hastened to decree the immediate and unconditional reception of the French refugees fleeing with their families the chaos and devastation spread by the red hydra. Our appeal did not fall on deaf ears as the French flock to Central America, an Empire that reminds them of home, and where they will now live in peace. In addition to the many civilians, many military officers and venerable veterans such as Charles de Gaulle, François Darland, Maxime Weygand and Alphonse Juin also found their way to our lands, presenting themselves as leaders of the French exiles.\n\nUbico invited them to the Imperial palace to discuss and celebrate our friendship, the extravagant ceremony went perfectly and delighted the Emperor. However, some rumors say that happiness is not shared by the exiled officers who would plan to take power by deposing the one they call the 'false Emperor', of course, Ubico does not believe these rumors, our French war veteran friends are trustworthy!"

french_guatemala.4.d:0 "The citizens of the Imperial capital woke up today to the sound of soldiers' boots and French military marches, a sight that seems normal under Ubico's Central America but that hides a very different reality.\n\nTroops of French exiles led by Charles de Gaulle, François Darlan and many other French sub-officers surrounded the capital from all sides while Ubico was still sleeping peacefully. In a speech to his army, General De Gaulle denounced Ubico as a false Emperor and a usurper who thought he was a Frenchman without actually being one, he also proclaimed the lands of Central America as now belonging to the new French Republic, proclaiming himself interim President of the Republic, he demanded the immediate surrender of the Emperor's troops and said that he did not want to spill blood.\n\nUbico was shocked to hear this news when he woke up, he launched a radio appeal calling on the Imperial troops loyal to the Empire and the French exiles to join him as soon as possible in the capital to fight the insurgents.\n\nLoyal troops from the former Nicaragua, composed of both mainland French and Central American French, arrived a short time ago. A bloody battle that will determine the survival of the Empire will now take place..."

However, the Junta must designate a president following a vote among the officers for him to be truly legitimate, 3 main candidates are available.\n\nThe first and most obvious is General De Gaulle himself, a protégé of the Lion of Verdun, Pétain, and a distinguished officer, he is also a gifted and competent administrator. A second choice is Admiral Darlan, leader of the naval officers and war veteran, he will undoubtedly make an excellent president. The third choice is a civilian politician and lawyer, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, who has attracted the attention of the junta because he has defended our most controversial actions, designated as 'war crimes' by the international community, as justified and just, he will undoubtedly make a perfect figurehead president for the GFSN, the fact that he is a politician giving us more legitimacy.\n\nThe vote has just ended and the winner of the presidency is..."

As the rest of the government and the exiles begin to rally around this patriotic new moniker, our cultural renaissance and Frenchification process shall only continue to grow, spread, and prosper as we attempt to carve out the second French exile state since the rise of the vile Commune."

Though a long shot, we could try to march into these former lands of ours and take up the fight of our ancestors, working to undo their losses and failures in order to bring glory to the French people once again. Of course, many oppose this move on the grounds that we are in no position to challenge the hegemons of the New World, but what do they know? \n\nDown with the humiliating Treaty of Paris of 1763! Down with the vile Haitian Revolution! Down with the perfidious Vente de la Louisiane! Down with every last mistake and folly of the old Empire, for she shall be born anew in a baptism of flame and glory.

He has, however, not specified which would take priority over the others..."
GUA_ask_for_favours:0 "Industrial Investments"
GUA_ask_for_favours_desc:0 "In the modern world, only industrialized countries can be successful, and Guatemala has had for a long time a simple agrarian society. If we wish to move forward as a nation, we need to focus our efforts in an industrialisation program. Luckily, we can grant some small concessions to the UFC in order to get the capital we need to kickstart the project."
GUA_more_favours:0 "New Development Schemes"
GUA_more_favours_desc:0 "As our industrialisation program starts to bring us profits, we have devised a series of new development schemes that could change the way we construct our industrial parks and infrastructure. Our trade partners in the UFC have informed us that if we grant them a few more concessions, they'd continue to fund the development of Guatemala. Our country is lucky to have such a generous trade partner as the UFC!"
GUA_attract_migrants:0 "Attract Migrants"
GUA_attract_migrants_desc:0 "Guatemala is a small nation, and while we have one of the largest populations of Central America, our industrialisation efforts paired up with our old agrarian initiatives have stretched our work force very thin. We need to start promoting immigration to our country if we wish to continue our ambitious economic plans."
GUA_fix_illiteracy:0 "Greatly Increase Education Budget"
GUA_fix_illiteracy_desc:0 "Despite Orellana's past efforts, illiteracy rates in Guatemala are still cripplingly high. As our country improves, we now lack a professional workforce to operate the many new jobs, and while we can still import professionals from other countries, we have the potential to rely on ourselves if we deal with our illiteracy issues. With this objective in mind, Orellana has decreed a drastic increase in the education budget."
GUA_teachers_are_good:0 "Promote the Teaching Profession"
GUA_teachers_are_good_desc:0 "We won't solve illiteracy by just increasing education spending. We face a severe shortage of teachers and professors in our country, forcing many of current teachers to work overtime at multiple schools. With this in mind, we shall begin a massive increase to their wages in order to promote the teaching profession."
GUA_american_scientists:0 "Import American Know-How"
GUA_american_scientists_desc:0 "Our investments are proving to be successful, and our illiteracy rates are steadily dropping. However, change has been gradual, and we have a rather high demand at the moment for technical know-how. For the time being, we should hire American experts to meet our demand. At least our nation can produce sufficient professionals of its own."
GUA_border_posts:0 "Tighten the Mexican Border"
GUA_border_posts_desc:0 "Mexican support for Central American socialism could prove dangerous if left unchecked. We shall reinforce the border security procedures, and double the border patrols in order to protect our country from the vile Mexican influence.

GUA_clamp_down:0 "Start Revoking Socialist Reforms"
GUA_clamp_down_desc:0 "Many politicians in the past have introduced socialist reforms that are now hindering our modernisation efforts and disrupt the activities of our trade partners, the UFC. We shall start eroding these reforms little by little until we can remove them completely from our work code, giving us greater freedom to carry out reforms without being hindered by such naïve concepts like 'welfare' or 'job security'."
GUA_more_propaganda:0 "Intensify Anti-Socialist Propaganda"
GUA_more_propaganda_desc:0 "Many citizens, fueled by syndicalist propaganda, have come to doubt our efforts to improve our fair nation.

GUA_clamp_down_more:0 "Expand the Martial Law"
GUA_clamp_down_more_desc:0 "Martial law at the beginning enacted merely a curfew and the usage of military force if needed to subdue any dissidence. However, as the uprising proved, this martial law wasn't as effective as we thought, and we will have to invest into strengthening the executive power of said martial law in order to guarantee a fast reaction against dissidents."
GUA_unlimited_presidency:0 "Orellana, El Presidente Eterno"
GUA_unlimited_presidency_desc:0 "President Orellana is slowly becoming a symbol of resilience in our nation.

GUA_promote_economy:0 "Realise Our True Potential"
GUA_promote_economy_desc:0 "With the defeat of the rebels, there's no one to oppose our reforms to take Guatemala to new heights.

This way we can reduce less on our agriculture, and more on our industrial output."
GUA_promote_more_education:0 "Education is the Basis of Success"
GUA_promote_more_education_desc:0 "One of the main objectives of the Orellana government is to improve the overall education in the nation and reduce the illiteracy rates. Now, with a strengthened government, Orellana has announced a new funding frenzy for University projects, schools and an increase on teacher's wages. This will surely bring us up to speed with the rest of the world!"
GUA_stop_pestering_me:0 "Stability and Prosperity"
GUA_stop_pestering_me_desc:0 "The two main axis of the new Orellanan government will be 'Estabilidad y Prosperidad'.

GUA_execute_dissidents:0 "Eradicate the Opposition"

GUA_no_syndies_escape:0 "Intensify Patrols on the Mexican Border"
GUA_no_syndies_escape_desc:0 "Mexico has become a hotspot for revolutionary thought, and as such it threatens the stability of our nation, allowing rebels to cross the border, rearming and resting and the coming back to continue their insurgency. We shall intensify the border patrols, so no one may come in nor out of Guatemala without our forces having a say in the matter!"
GUA_better_constitution:0 "A New Constitution for our Great Leader"
GUA_better_constitution_desc:0 "Ubico, being a charismatic leader, has proposed a constitutional reform in order to be able to secure Guatemalan stability for the near future. Provided that he has tried pushing for several reforms and the constitution is either slowing down or outright forbidding his actions, it is in our best interest to start a constitutional reform."

GUA_napoleonic_ambitions_desc:0 "Ubico is a hero for Guatemala, and everyone in the nation will know this fact! From Belize to Ocos, and from San Mateo Ixtatán to Esquipulas, all the citizens of Guatemala shall learn to appreciate our glorious leader!"

GUA_napoleonic_state_desc:0 "Ubico, a faithful admirer of Napoleon's exploits, has set out to transform Guatemala into what his idol had envisioned for France back in the early 19th century, or at least, as close as he can do so in a nation as Guatemala."

GUA_education_investment:0 "Policy on Education"
GUA_education_investment_desc:0 "As the dust settles, we need to review the government policies on education. While Orellana had done a great work reducing illiteracy, Guatemala still has a long way to go before becoming a forward thinking and 'educated' nation."
GUA_scavenge_UFC:0 "Dealing with the UFC"
GUA_scavenge_UFC_desc:0 "The United Fruit Company, the bane of Guatemala for decades now, is finally at our mercy. It now falls to us to decide what shall be our stance with them.

GUA_complete_nationalisation_desc:0 "With the end of our alliance with the democrats and our victory over their faction, we can now start to turn Guatemala into a proper socialist society.

GUA_first_empire_larp:0 "L'Empire Autoritaire"
GUA_first_empire_larp_desc:0 "The Emperor chose to follow Napoleon, the first of the name, as his model. It was a natural choice because Napoleon is the founder of the Bonaparte legend, the only man to have brought all of Europe to its feet and to lead his nation to a glory that it would never know after Napoleon. It is a man like him that we need for Central America, a strong, popular and charismatic Caesarist leader, Ubico is obviously the man for the job."
GUA_second_empire_larp:0 "L'Empire Libéral"
GUA_second_empire_larp_desc:0 "If it is true that Napoleon I is much more prestigious than Napoleon III and his Second Empire, we must not forget the many efforts made by Napoleon III to modernize his country, guiding it through the Industrial Revolution, creating significant economic growth, recovering its lost glory following the defeat of the Eagle and allowing for much greater political freedom than under his ancestor. Central America also needs to be modernized and guided, fortunately, the wise Emperor Ubico is there for the people."
GUA_code_civil:0 "Le Code Civil"
GUA_code_civil_desc:0 "If there is one thing to remember from Napoleon's reign, it is the Civil Code, also called the Napoleonic Code. This very modern legal code has helped structure French society until today, the Code still being in place in the French Republic exiled in Algiers.

GUA_plebiscite:0 "Le Plébiscite"
GUA_plebiscite_desc:0 "One of the characteristics of the Napoleonic regime and a proof of its popularity and the adhesion of the masses to the cause of the Empire is undoubtedly the plebiscite, a way of asking the people their opinion on a question concerning them all to which they answer with 'yes' or 'no'. Emperor Ubico intends to use the plebiscite to create a real direct democracy while reinforcing his position and his privileged link with the people."

GUA_Loi_Ollivier_2_desc:0 "In 1864, Emile Ollivier proposed the famous eponymous law which ensured the right to strike to the workers of the Second Empire, a first for that time.

GUA_military_legacy_desc:0 "Napoleonic France, surrounded by many countries hostile to its ideals and the Eagle, needed to be militarized to overcome the many trials that awaited it. Our Central American Empire is in a similar situation, from the American imperialists in the North to the Reds on our doorstep, we are surrounded by enemies, therefore our society must be as militarized as possible to ensure that our Empire never falls into hands hostile to our people."
GUA_renovation:0 "Complete Renovation of Central America"
GUA_renovation_desc:0 "Central America is unfortunately not developed enough to support an Empire as big and powerful as ours, a good part of our economy is still agrarian and have not even experienced industrialization yet. The Emperor cannot be satisfied with this status-quo! Great and extravagant renovation and modernization works must be carried out in the four corners of the Empire to bring it straight into the 20th century as soon as possible."
GUA_cult_of_personnality:0 "A Double Cult of Personality"
GUA_cult_of_personnality_desc:0 "In our Empire, a cult should not be led to only Napoleon or to only Ubico, but to the two sovereigns who deserve both admiration for their numerous exploits and conquests.

GUA_russia_desc:0 "The Russian campaign was the one that marked the end of the Napoleonic epic, the winter cold, the vastness of Russia and the loose scorched earth of the Russians having gotten the better of the Emperor's army. We must avenge the Emperor! Of course we cannot attack Russia from where we are, but in the West the Mexican giant is in every way similar to Russia - an untethered hegemon seeking to subjugate our proud people. The campaign of Mexico will be our campaign of Russia!"
GUA_britain:0 "Crush the Perfidious Albion"
GUA_britain_desc:0 "Where Napoleon never succeeded in going in spite of all his efforts, it is the coasts of the perfidious British, cowards hidden on their island behind their Royal Navy.

GUA_spain:0 "A New Peninsular Campaign"
GUA_spain_desc:0 "Spain was one of the many countries, and certainly the most important, to have been subjugated by Napoleon and to have known the spreading of the Civil Code on these lands.

The opening of scholarships for the Escuela Politécnica, a military academy in San Juan Sacatepéquez, convinced him to join the institution in 1932 as the only way to sustain his family. He has since then become an exceptional student, reaching the rank of First Sergeant of the Company of Knight-Cadets, a post that has only been achieved by 4 other students in the last 12 years. His talent gained him the respect of the staff of the academy, including the American headmaster, John Considine. Árbenz graduated in 1935, and he has since then served as a teacher in the academy while having the respect of most of the army staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Staunch Defender of Democracy."

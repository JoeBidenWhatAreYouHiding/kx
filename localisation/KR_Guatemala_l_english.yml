### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JOSE_MARIA_ORELLANA_DESC:0 "Orellana's military dictatorship beginning in 1921 has grown stagnant, with both him and his cabinet exhausted with constantly having to deal with protests against his presidency, social uprisings, and people wishing for true democracy to be returned. His main focus of building the economy and fighting illiteracy has also begun to slow down over time due to some sort of opposition from one side or another. Guatemala grows tired and demands change which Orellana cannot bring in the countries current state, and a shakeup could make him meet his undesirable fate..."
POLITICS_UBICO_NAPOLEON_DESC:0 "Born to Guatemala's upper class in 1878, Jorge Ubico Castañeda has long held a silver spoon in his hand. Receiving private tutoring as a boy and higher education overseas in Europe and the United States, his pathway to high success was paved at a young age. At 19, he joined the Guatemalan army upon being granted a commission due to his familial ties, and began his meteoric rise to the top from there. All along the way, the young Ubico looked to one man as his inspiration: Napoleon Bonaparte, deposed Emperor of France. As he grew older and achieved his dreams and more, Ubico began to take this fascination even farther, actively modeling his own image and mannerisms after the ‘Little Colonel.’ Now, ruling over all of Central America, Ubico has taken this obsession one step farther, fashioning himself as Jorge I, Emperor of Central America, while modeling this Lating American state on the now-collapsed First French Empire. Frequently remarking to his companions on how similar he and the long-dead Frenchman are, both in looks and personality, many within his cabinet have taken issue with this ‘admiration.’ Nonetheless, they can do little to stop this ‘Little Napoleon of the Tropics’, for absolute power is already within his reach..."

guatemala.1.t:0 "Intro to Guatemala"
guatemala.1.d:0 "Guatemala's political chaos started in 1898, when Manuel Estrada Cabrera came into power. Cabrera's “Liberal” party had a deep control over the government, with all elections up until 1920 being rigged towards the Liberal party under Cabrera. This period also vastly increased the influence of the United Fruit Company, an American owned business focused on increasing the amount of exports towards America for cheaper prices.\n\nThis changed in 1920, when the Liberal party faced extreme opposition following earthquakes in 1918 that destroyed the industry Cabrera had setup. His lack of response resulted in the Conservatives within the country forming the Unionist Party, with the people running the party consisting of José Azmitia, Tácito Molina, Eduardo Camacho, Julio Bianchi and Emilio Escamilla, while also being supported by the Catholic church within Guatemala.\n\nThe Unionist Party prepared the “Three-Fold Act”, which was the founding policy of the party, and they distributed these in Guatemala City on the New Year of 1920. This led to an extreme rise of the popularity of the Unionists, with protests occurring outside the capital on March 11th, 1920, with the crowd being fired upon and the populace left more angered than before. The final straw was in 1920, when Adrián Vidaurre, President of the National Assembly, declared Cabrera unfit to rule and deposed him, though still facing fierce resistance from Cabrera's supporters. They thereby made Carlos Herrera President of Guatemala.\n\nHerrara balanced a very careful political tightrope due to him having Liberal aligned views while representing the Unionist Party. This tightrope snapped in 1921, when he critically upset the Liberal party by refusing to offer concessions the UFC, resulting in a military coup led by José María Orellana. He represented the needs and demands of the Liberal Party, offering concessions to the UFC the following year.\n\nThe political situation has completely stagnated since then, with Orellana ruling over his regime while balancing the needs of both the left and right. Guatemala now stands frozen..."
guatemala.1.a:0 "Orellana is eternal."

guatemala.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Us!"
guatemala.2.d:0 "Black Monday has hit the United States, making their economic recession even worse. Ripples are being felt all across Central America, our crops remain unsold and US companies shrink in size to avoid bankruptcy."
guatemala.2.a:0 "What will this mean for Guatemala?"

guatemala.3.t:0 "Legal Issues"
guatemala.3.d:0 "Several peasants sued the United Fruit Company and certain provincial governors on flimsy grounds such as having their land sold by other parties without their knowledge, local governors seizing their land for the UFC without sensible reason, and ignoring the last wills for heirless people. It is obvious that the socialists pressured these peasants, instructing them to push their claims and helping them with the legal fees."
guatemala.3.a:0 "Listen to their pleas, return the land and try to do something about corruption."
guatemala.3.b:0 "These are surely just made up excuses!"

guatemala.4.t:0 "The American Civil War"
guatemala.4.t_nocw:0 "America Stabilizes"
guatemala.4.d:0 "The American Civil war has broken out! Our biggest trading partner disappeared almost overnight. UFC officials are scrambling to save as much as they can in the chaos, selling off assets to stabilise their situation. Their support for Orellana has weakened considerably; a dark cloud now looms on the horizon of Guatemala."
guatemala.4.d_nocw:0 "Much to our shock, it seems like the situation in the United States is stabilizing. Unfortunately, it seems that without the specter of war in the US, the Guatemalan populace no longer has a diversion against Orellana's own unpopularity. As the US President looks inwards, it seems that the regime in Guatemala has found itself utterly alone."
guatemala.4.a:0 "Guatemala will survive."

guatemala.5.t:0 "Letter of the 311"
guatemala.5.d:0 "A group of democrats and socialists, mainly composed of university students, wrote a letter designated to President Orellana asking for his resignation and for free elections to start as soon as possible. Orellana knows his support dwindled and the democratic movement militarised and started talks with the socialists to declare open revolt to bring 'freedom' to Guatemala, this letter just being the tipping point of the tensions. If the government rejects this apparently 'heart-felt' letter coming from the future of Guatemala, civil war is all but inevitable."
guatemala.5.a:0 "Start preparing for elections as soon as possible, to avert disaster."
guatemala.5.b:0 "This is just a socialist conspiracy! Guatemala will not be corrupted!"

guatemala.6.t:0 "Ubico's Coup"
guatemala.6.d:0 "Seeing the weakness of Orellana and the inevitable elections that would bring socialists into government, the popular hardline general Jorge Ubico Castañeda has entered the capital with his loyal army and deposed Orellana. As soon as the news hit the country, the democratic-socialist coalition, the National Renovation Party, started taking direct control of several cities and declared Ubico's regime illegitimate, starting a civil war. Some of the more moderate people, appalled by Ubico's power grab, joined their cause."
guatemala.6.a:0 "Ubico will save us from socialism!"

guatemala.7.t:0 "Ubico's Speech to the People"
guatemala.7.d:0 "Several days after the coup, as he managed to stabilise his rule in the capital, Ubico gave a speech to the people of Ciudad de Guatemala:\n'Fellow Guatemalans, I come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason. Let no Guatemalan deny the perils of our time. While we battle one another, divided by the petty strife of our common history, the tide of a greater conflict is turning against us, threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished. It is time for us as individuals to set aside our long-standing feuds and unite. The tides of an unwinnable war are upon us, and we must seek refuge upon higher ground, lest we be swept away by the flood.\nThe United States of America is no more! Whatever semblance of unity and protection it once provided is a phantom, a memory. With our enemies left unchecked, who will you turn to for protection? The devastation wrought by the socialists is self-evident. We have seen our cities occupied by the National Renovation Party. We have seen firsthand our friends and loved ones shackled by them. Unprecedented and unimaginable though they may be, these are the signs of our time.\nThe time has come, my fellow Guatemalans, to rally to a new banner. In unity lies strength. Out of the many we shall forge an indivisible whole, answering only to a single throne, and from that throne, I shall watch over you.'\nThe booing of the supporters of the PRN were drowned in the standing ovations of the crowds."
guatemala.7.a:0 "We will fight for Guatemala! For Ubico!"

guatemala.8.t:0 "Opening Strategies"
guatemala.8.d:0 "As the chaos throughout the country subsided, vast areas have ended up controlled by the National Renovation Party. They are trying to expand their position in an aggressive manner, and underground cells have formed in most cities that still are nominally loyal to us. What would be the best course of action?"
guatemala.8.a:0 "Secure the temporary borders, not one mile will be ceded!"
guatemala.8.b:0 "Focus on rooting out opposition in loyalist lands."

guatemala.9.t:0 "Choosing a Target"
guatemala.9.d:0 "[getgua8], the military staff had to decide their strategy for the war. Would they advance directly on the mountainous makeshift rebel capital of Quetzaltenango, ending the rebellion fast but in a very costly assault, or try to starve the rebels by moving onwards to Ciudad de Belize and then cut them off from the Mexican border, isolating them?"
guatemala.9.a:0 "They will fall like flies, onward to Quetzaltenango!"
guatemala.9.b:0 "We shouldn't waste honourable Guatemalan lives in vain, starve the rebels into submission."

gua_8_d1:0 "After we secured our borders"
gua_8_d2:0 "After Ciudad de Guatemala and other urban centres were cleared of any PRN presence"

guatemala.10.t:0 "The Siege of Ciudad de Belize"
guatemala.10.d:0 "As the rebel defenses are overstretched, the concentrated blow to their main port in Belize went by with no issues. We registered barely any losses, and already started marching to the Mexican border to encircle whatever remains of the rebel forces, as their resources grow scarcer. While it is obvious to all parties involved that Mexico heavily assists the rebellion, the spineless socialists will surely not declare war to protect their proteges, even when their means of supporting the rebels will disappear."
guatemala.10.a:0 "The rebels know their demise is imminent."

guatemala.11.t:0 "The Assault on the Capital"
guatemala.11.d:0 "As our troops were finishing securing the border with Mexico, the rebels moved against Ciudad de Guatemala! This time it was them pouring all their resources into a final attack to make us flee from the capital and break our will. With a good chunk of our forces guarding the western border, this fight will be a hard one. Some generals even suggested letting them in the capital, fighting them in the streets, buying time for our forces to occupy the now virtually defenseless rebel land."
guatemala.11.a:0 "We will never let them enter Ciudad de Guatemala!"
guatemala.11.b:0 "It would be better for our long term goals to dye our capital red with blood."

guatemala.12.t:0 "The End of the Civil War"
guatemala.12.d:0 "After weeks of fighting in the streets of Ciudad de Guatemala, our troops managed to return to the capital, encircling the rebels, forcing their surrender. Our victorious president called for a parade the very next day. Through the bloody streets of Guatemala, the troops paraded valiantly, holding the Guatemalan flag up high, to the cheers of the people, who can taste peace at last. [getgua12d]"
guatemala.12.a:0 "[getgua12a]"
gua_12_d2:0 "The government started working towards making the civil war just a painful memory, and continue the path to a better Guatemala, as they did for the last 18 years, all under the guiding hand of Orellana, our dear president."
gua_12_d1:0 "The government already started working on plans to help the country heal and recover, preparing to enter a new era, all under the guiding hand of Ubico."
gua_12_a2:0 "Long live our President!"
gua_12_a1:0 "Peace, at last. Praise Ubico!"

guatemala.13.t:0 "A Statue for Our Victor"
guatemala.13.d:0 "As Ciudad de Guatemala is being rebuilt, the people (mainly high-class aristocracy) expressed their earnest desire for a statue dedicated to Ubico, to immortalise his role as the man who stopped the socialists from ruining Guatemala. It would be built in the likeness of the heroes of old, with Ubico on a fine steed, holding his saber forward."
guatemala.13.a:0 "We are truly grateful."

guatemala.14.t:0 "Rebuilding Ciudad de Guatemala"
guatemala.14.d:0 "As Ciudad de Guatemala was badly damaged by the final skirmish with the rebels, a big reconstruction project has commenced. Ubico wants to make the roads better and wider, to prepare Guatemala to be a capital for a larger Central America. However, more skeptical members of the government proposed a more sensible plan, to increase the defenses of the capital, to never again have such a bloodbath happen inside its borders."
guatemala.14.a:0 "Guatemala will never again be threatened, rebuild it with grandeur!"
guatemala.14.b:0 "Better to be conservative and protect the capital from further threats."

guatemala.15.t:0 "Civil War!"
guatemala.15.d:0 "The National Renovation Party has used the days since the letter to prepare themselves to declare open revolt! They managed to take over Quetzaltenango and Ciudad de Belize, with most of the land in between them and the Mexican border. The government is in disarray trying to come up with a plan to stabilise the situation and defeat the rebels."
guatemala.15.a:0 "Rebel scum!"

guatemala.16.t:0 "Disaster!"
guatemala.16.d:0 "Quetzaltenango proved to be a formidable fortress. The loyalist armies were bogged down in its defensive layers and were incurring much heavier losses than the rebels. Feeling desperate, the government sent more and more troops to help the siege. After the defenses of Ciudad de Guatemala were thinned enough, the PRN members hiding in the city came out and managed to take out the lightly protected leadership! The higher echelons fell into anarchy, with most of them escaping while the PRN took hold of the country. Hearing this news, the army, tired after the fighting, held the white flag."
guatemala.16.a:0 "Long live Guatemalan Freedom!"

guatemala.17.t:0 "Victory!"
guatemala.17.d:0 "The fighting was brutal. The rebels made Quetzaltenango into a formidable fortress. We incurred heavy losses. We needed to pledge all our reserves to the fight. The capital was virtually undefended. However, we succeeded. We broke through their lines yesterday, and captured their leaders. As most rebels were in this city, the rebellion was effectively broken. After a brief respite, the army marched in the rest of the country and made sure all the remaining pockets were defeated."
guatemala.17.a:0 "Guatemala finds peace, at last!"

guatemala.18.t:0 "The Cost of Pride"
guatemala.18.d:0 "Refusing to let the rebels taint the capital, the defenders rallied in front of Ciudad de Guatemala. The battle was a bloody one, with many loses on both sides, but the numerical superiority of the rebels won over the smaller defending army. When it was clear that the rebels would win, the government escaped the capital, leaving it open to be liberated by the PRN. Hearing this news, the rest of the army, scattered around the Mexican border, agreed to lay down their arms and swear allegiance to the new government."
guatemala.18.a:0 "Freedom, at last!"

guatemala.19.t:0 "The Fate of El Salvador"
guatemala.19.d:0 "El Salvador has turned red! While we managed to put down the rebellion in our land, it seems they have failed. Our government has decided to prepare for war to liberate our brethren!"
guatemala.19.a:0 "To Arms!"

guatemala.22.t:0 "Elections of [GetYear]"
guatemala.22.d:0 "Elections are a healthy part of any democracy. Unfortunately in Guatemala, they have rarely been fair, with the opposition either non-existent or heavily disadvantaged and electoral violence. A major event in Guatemala's democratic spring will occur with the holding of free and fair elections. The Revolutionary Coalition, having served its purpose in overthrowing the Liberal dictatorship and restoring order after the civil war, will be disbanded and each party will run in the election. It will likely be a close affair with each party having separate and established support bases: the Unionist party appeals to conservative, religious folk, the PRN represents the progressive youth, and the FLP aims to sway the workers and peasants."
guatemala.22.a:0 "Spiritual Socialism and the PRN will lead Guatemala into the future"
guatemala.22.b:0 "Vitalism and the Central American dream reign supreme."
guatemala.22.c:0 "In an upset, the FLP come out on top."

guatemala.23.t:0 "The Counter-Revolution!"
guatemala.23.d:0 "Ubico returned with an army of mercenaries paid for by the UFC! He landed in Belize and started to march towards the capital, while we're trying to prepare defenses to meet him in battle, even though we're very weakened due to the previous civil war."
guatemala.23.a:0 "Ubico defeats the government!"
guatemala.23.b:0 "Ubico is stopped, the revolution is saved!"

guatemala.69.t:0 "Naval Disaster"
guatemala.69.d:0 "As the Guatemalan navy finally had more than one lonely ship, they were sent out to do formation training. However, the sheer incompetence of the newly trained sailors resulted in one of the ships hitting the other during targeting training, forcing it to capsize. Fearful of an adverse reaction from the people that so much money has gone to waste, Ubico's propaganda machine tried to spin it as a reenactment of the battle of Trafalgar."
guatemala.69.a:0 "That’s an... interesting turn of events."

guatemala.100.t:0 "Nobody Had the Guts to Leave the Temple!"
guatemala.100.d:0 "The legacy of extravagance and hedonism that president Cabrera embodies still remains scattered throughout Guatemala in the form of Minervan Temples. These buildings were used for Fiestas Minervalias, a holiday of Cabrera's own design. There were children singing, dances, and very unchristian attractions to behold in those days. Now the temples are deserted, and local priests ensure that no festivities are held. This would be the end of their use, if not for our inventive government. They have proposed we convert these halls of vice into baseball fields for children, or build them up into housing. The right would prefer to see them as baseball fields, while the left sees our housing issue as important enough to build up."
guatemala.100.a:0 "Baseball Fields."
guatemala.100.b:0 "Houses."

guatemala.101.t:0 "Conflicts in the Unionist Party"
guatemala.101.d:0 "Today, a faction of the Unionist Party led José Azmitia and another led by Lázaro Chacón González have entered into an open conflict due to disagreements over the power of the President in the country. While González defends a more centralized state that gives more power to the president, Azmitia fears that this will just turn González into just another dictator for Guatemala, and their differences have finally spilled over to their followers that have openly clashed. However, both men had a meeting and have made joint public statement claiming they have reconciled their differences in order to keep the country up and running. It is not clear however if they have truly reconciled or they are just banding together out of necessity..."
guatemala.101.a:0 "Let's hope they have truly reconciled."

guatemala.102.t:0 "Furthering of Central American Thought"
guatemala.102.d:0 "One of the main objectives of the Unionist party has been since its inception to reinforce the idea of a Central American way of thinking, as well as establishing Guatemala as a key player in the independence of Central America as a whole. While the process to introduce these concepts will be slow, we're starting to see the first signs of improvement in our schools, where now many remember Guatamala as the leader of the Central American independence movement."
guatemala.102.a:0 "The Unionistas are achieving their goals."

guatemala.103.t:0 "Dealing with Arévalo"
guatemala.103.d:0 "With our alliance with the FLP now being broken, we have to deal with the remains of the PPN that kept us together. Juan Jose Arévalo, leader of the PPN and the man who tried to keep the PU and the FLP together against authoritarianism now stands questioned by his actions during such times of crisis. While he has certainly helped us to strengthen our position and take over power, he also provided aid for the PFLP, even sometimes taking their side on internal arguments during our coalition days, and he might have flocked to their side if they had taken over instead of us. It is for this that many in our party are distrustful of Arévalo, and demand us to exile him from the country as a traitor. What should we do?"
guatemala.103.a:0 "Exile him, he has no place here."
guatemala.103.b:0 "We all make mistakes, He is still an Ally."

guatemala.104.t:0 "Dr. John Cutler Offers to Experiment on Guatemalan Citizens for Cash"
guatemala.104.d:0 "A call from one Dr. John Cutler came in today requesting a meeting with the president. Seeing no harm a meeting was granted, and what must be one of the most fearful yet interesting propositions to be delivered in Guatemalan history. Dr. Cutler is a senior member of the US Public Health Service, an authority on the prevention of disease. He offers to test the effects of penicillin on preventing syphilis on a select group of Guatemalans. The reason Guatemala was selected, as claimed by Cutler, is because our people live in isolated communities that can be assured to not spread venereal disease very far. While this offer and the payment are attractive, one has to wonder why Cutler is so willing to import medicine at such a great cost."
guatemala.104.a:0 "Get Down With the Sickness."

guatemala.105.t:0 "Introducing Miss Chiquita"
guatemala.105.d:0 "The banana as foodstuffs is no longer an exotic good to American buyers. This was expected after several decades of business. What isn't expected is competition from the likes of Dole in Hawaii to stir the pot in his favour. We commissioned Dik Browne to design a mascot for our banana division that will recapture the attention of young people. Her name is Miss Chiquita, and her song and dance now adorn radio broadcasts and newspapers across America. Sales are up as well."

guatemala.106.d:0 "A plot to assassinate our beloved Ubico has been found out by our intelligence service today. It detailed an extremely elaborate plan to infiltrate the Casa Crema and poison The President. However, our intelligence service hasn't been able to identify the perpetrators yet, and as the rumours of the conspiracy have conveniently reached the press, we need to choose a scapegoat to blame for the scandal."
guatemala.106.a:0 "The Socialists are behind this."

french_guatemala.1.d:0 "The Emperor, his army and his loyal subjects succeeded in securing Central America from all those who attacked our legitimate territory, from socialist revolutionaries to nationalist insurgents to liberal reformers, all united in their hatred of our Emperor. Now that we have defeated these pests, we can rest easy, however the question of the future of our Empire arises and our Emperor must make a choice that will be decisive for the nation.\n\nTwo choices are available to us, either we decide to create an Empire modeled on the one built by Napoleon I, the idol of our Emperor, as we initially planned, however Ubico also admires the Bonapartes as a whole, including Napoleon III, the nephew of Napoleon I and the leader of the Second French Empire, we could choose to model our regime on the state created by this venerable man, an empire that would be less militarized, more social and liberal but just as glorious.\n\nUbico is the only one who can choose, and he will decide in the end that..."

french_guatemala.2.t:0 "What Power for the Legislature?"
french_guatemala.2.d:0 "With our decision to create a Liberal Empire comes the creation of a legislature that has the task of assisting Emperor Ubico in the administration of his vast domain. This legislature is based on that of the Second French Empire, and is composed of an Upper House, the Senate, and a Lower House, the Legislative Body.\n\nThese two chambers are elected by direct universal male suffrage by the citizens of the Empire who are over 20 years of age. Of course, several parties will have the right to run for office, but we have also taken over the concept of the 'official candidate' of the Second Empire, who benefits from advantages during their campaign as well as from a great visibility assured by the State, assuring us a comfortable majority in the chambers.\n\nHowever, a question that comes up more and more frequently is: what will be the real powers of the two chambers? Some of the Emperor's advisors have expressed their support for a Senate and a Legislative Body that would only have honorary powers and therefore would only be representative, while others express their desire to have chambers with legislative power, but with the creation of a special right of veto, which is only possessed by the Emperor himself and which he can use as he pleases, which will limits the powers of the chambers.\n\nUbico has considered both proposals and is now ready to make a choice."

Upon hearing the news, the Emperor hastened to decree the immediate and unconditional reception of the French refugees fleeing with their families the chaos and devastation spread by the red hydra. Our appeal did not fall on deaf ears as the French flock to Central America, an Empire that reminds them of home, and where they will now live in peace. In addition to the many civilians, many military officers and venerable veterans such as Charles de Gaulle, François Darland, Maxime Weygand and Alphonse Juin also found their way to our lands, presenting themselves as leaders of the French exiles.\n\nUbico invited them to the Imperial palace to discuss and celebrate our friendship, the extravagant ceremony went perfectly and delighted the Emperor. However, some rumors say that happiness is not shared by the exiled officers who would plan to take power by deposing the one they call the 'false Emperor', of course, Ubico does not believe these rumors, our French war veteran friends are trustworthy!"

In a speech to his army, General De Gaulle denounced Ubico as a false Emperor and a usurper who thought he was a Frenchman without actually being one, he also proclaimed the lands of Central America as now belonging to the new French Republic, proclaiming himself interim President of the Republic, he demanded the immediate surrender of the Emperor's troops and said that he did not want to spill blood.\n\nUbico was shocked to hear this news when he woke up, he launched a radio appeal calling on the Imperial troops loyal to the Empire and the French exiles to join him as soon as possible in the capital to fight the insurgents.\n\nLoyal troops from the former Nicaragua, composed of both mainland French and Central American French, arrived a short time ago. A bloody battle that will determine the survival of the Empire will now take place..."

However, the Junta must designate a president following a vote among the officers for him to be truly legitimate, 3 main candidates are available.\n\nThe first and most obvious is General De Gaulle himself, a protégé of the Lion of Verdun, Pétain, and a distinguished officer, he is also a gifted and competent administrator. A second choice is Admiral Darlan, leader of the naval officers and war veteran, he will undoubtedly make an excellent president. The third choice is a civilian politician and lawyer, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, who has attracted the attention of the junta because he has defended our most controversial actions, designated as 'war crimes' by the international community, as justified and just, he will undoubtedly make a perfect figurehead president for the GFSN, the fact that he is a politician giving us more legitimacy.\n\nThe vote has just ended and the winner of the presidency is..."

democratic_guatemala.1.d:0 "Today the people of the Second Republic of Guatemala have come out in force to vote in the first national elections under the new Constitution.In a crowded field four frontrunners have emerged. The first is Jacobo Arbenz, a former Army officer. While his detractors claim he harbors ambitions of autocracy, his promise of wide ranging land reform has hit a key with the masses and made him wildly popular.  Second in line stands Juan Jose Arevalo, a philosophy professor who has made equally ambitious promises of wide ranging social reforms and government reforms. This has also struck a chord in the countryside and has made him almost as popular if not just as popular as Arbenz. Third in line is Enrique Peralta Azurdia, a candidate favored by the military for his pro-defense statements. This popularity has made some fear that should he lose the military will force his appointment. The last candidate is Carlos Castillo Armas, a military man with unabashed authoritarian leanings. He has become a standard bearer of the cause of order over all and has declared his intention to “weed out Syndicalism root and stem” should he be  elected."

democratic_guatemala.5.d:0 "With the restoration of democracy in full swing the many parties that once made up Guatemala’s political landscape before Ubico have reemerged in one form or another. Some parties, like those on the left, have adapted to the rise of Syndicalism since their abolishment and as such are not quite the same as they once were, but it seems the electorate doesn't mind. The landscape itself however has changed much in the years since Ubico took power. The people have been, expectantly, more drawn to the parties pledging to work within the system which has given them an early edge over the others. However even Ubico had supporters and they have coalesced under the handful of far right parties. While some of them have pledged to work within the system there are those who explicitly seek to overthrow the Second Republic. While Democracy is triumphant today all Guatemalans know that Liberty is not a right, it’s something to be earned and protected. Time will tell if they will be successful a second time."

democratic_guatemala.1220.d:0 "Today rumors have reached the President of a military plot to overthrow him. This is not especially worrying as Arevalo has already had to quash 12 such plots in just the short time he has been in office. The difference however comes in that the plot has rapidly gained steam. Despite being just a few weeks old the plot has already roped in two generals and a not insignificant portion of the officer corps. The plotters appear to have been spooked by Arevalo’s labor reform program. They see it not as a necessity but as thinly veiled Syndicalism. They demand that Arevalo revoke his reforms at once before they ‘take what actions are necessary to save the body politic’."

We have gotten reports that plotters have infiltrated the National Police units within Guatemala City and even the Presidential Guard. This brings them dangerously close to being able to carry out their coup. To fight them now would be hard if not entirely impossible. That is why a growing number of members of our own government have pleaded with Arevalo to give in to their demands. They point out that the nation has just recovered from the previous coup and to stay so stubborn as to invite another would tarnish Arevalo’s reputation for all time."

Then, 15 minutes later they marched into the capital and swiftly moved to occupy important intersections, communications hubs and government buildings. They caught the city sleeping as they intended to and captured many of their objectives without firing a shot. It was a brief gunbattle with the few armed guards of the Treasury at 6:11am that woke the city up. Loyalists were quickly alerted to the ongoing coup and rallied to defend what was left. However by then there was not much left to defend and many of the loyalists were quickly disarmed and forced to surrender. When the Army finally reached the Presidential Palace at 6:30 they found the Palace full of low level officials, mostly secretaries and janitors and aides. The important politicians, most notable among them President Arevalo himself, had managed to slip through the cracks and escaped the city. Despite this missed opportunity that would doom any other coup it seems Arevalo has decided against raising an army against the coup as he has yet to reappear. Instead the new Government of National Salvation has established an iron grip over Guatemala City and the rest of the nation will not be long behind it."

GUA_abandon_monroe_thought_desc:0 "The infamous Monroe Doctrine, in effect since 1823, has made us rely too much in our northern neighbour for our self defence, and now that they are not in any position to help us, we will have to kickstart our forces from scratch if we hope to survive the storm that approaches Central America."
GUA_superior_firepower_1:0 "Our Men are Precious"
GUA_superior_firepower_1_desc:0 "Guatemala is one of the nations with the highest populations in Central America. This provides us with an advantage in a war of attrition, and we should focus into taking advantage of this fact by investing in the development of technologies that allow us to save up as many of our troops as possible from combat in order to always have fresh troops to fight against our enemies."
GUA_artillery_bonus:0 "Bombardearlos desde Lejos"
GUA_artillery_bonus_desc:0 "Artillery has proven its usefulness during the Weltkrieg, and its utility in modern war cannot be underestimated.

GUA_support_companies:0 "Increase Division Capabilities"
GUA_support_companies_desc:0 "Our divisions are currently mostly suited to peacekeeping tasks and anti-insurgency combat, it's not really prepared to deal with modern warfare and that will prove problematic if a conflict arises in Central America where we are drawn into. We shall focus on improving the capabilities of our divisions for modern warfare so that they may be more flexible when the time comes to face the enemy."
GUA_motorised:0 "Mechanise Our Troops"
GUA_motorised_desc:0 "Mechanisation may seem like a strange thing for a Central American nation, but there's no doubt that it'll be the future of warfare.

GUA_firepower_doctrine:0 "Perfect Our Methods"
GUA_firepower_doctrine_desc:0 "Warfare is both a science and an art. While we may have some proud and capable officers in our ranks, the truth is that unless we tune our industry to suit their needs, they won't be able to guarantee our victory.

GUA_mass_assault_1_desc:0 "With Guatemala's numerical advantage, we can focus on creating a larger army which can take advantage of its numbers to swarm our enemies.

GUA_more_guns:0 "Streamline Gun Production"
GUA_more_guns_desc:0 "Guatemala's population may be high, but unless we arm each private with a rifle, it will hardly matter when facing off other professional armies, like the Salvadorian one. We will need to streamline our rifle production in order to provide sufficient rifles for our troops."

GUA_more_recruitment_desc:0 "The incoming storm requires every able-bodied men to sign up for the army and joint the fight in the front.

GUA_more_mils:0 "Use the Military as Workforce"
GUA_more_mils_desc:0 "The military doesn't need to be necessarily a simple combat force. It should be put to work to build industries and infrastructure and repair them when damaged.

GUA_MilInd_desc:0 "Improving our country is pointless if we do not have the means to defend it. While our generals and soldiers may have the hearts needed for the task, we need to make sure their equipment is up to the mark as well. This increase in money will also keep them compliant."

GUA_diversify_bananas_desc:0 "Growing bananas is all well and good, but we cannot risk a downturn in our harvest by growing one single type of banana. In order to cover more niches of the banana market, we must get more cultivars and grow more banana assortments."
GUA_invest_banana_profits:0 "Use Cash Crop Profits"
GUA_invest_banana_profits_desc:0 "The cash crops aren't called like this for no reason; we are earning plenty of money from their export. But we cannot just sit on it; it must be invested so that we can produce more and sell even more in the future."
GUA_ports:0 "Expand Our Ports"
GUA_ports_desc:0 "If we are to fulfil our naval ambitions, we have to first see what can we do with what ports we already have. Even if we can't do much militarily, our shipping industry will benefit."

# Napoleon Larping Moment

GUA_hail_emperor:0 "Notre Empereur"
GUA_hail_emperor_desc:0 "We have conquered Central America and now our Emperor Ubico, following in the footsteps of the Bonapartes of France, is the master of this land! However, there are many protest movements throughout the Empire, we have no time to rest on our laurels and must act immediately. Pour l'Empereur!"
GUA_strenghten_position:0 "Strengthen Our Position"
GUA_strenghten_position_desc:0 "Even some of Ubico's supporters doubt his position as Emperor, some seeing him as just a madman pretending to be what he is not. We will prove them wrong! Ubico is indeed Napoleon's heir and everyone must pledge loyalty to him and to our Empire. We will be the saviors of Central America, which will never be subjugated again!"
GUA_put_end_to_socialist:0 "Putting An End to Socialist Revolts"
GUA_put_end_to_socialist_desc:0 "All over the Empire, the reds denounce Ubico as a tyrant who is subservient to the American imperialists and has no use for the people, the socialists are even organizing revolts against the 'dictatorship' throughout Central America! It is intolerable, no negotiations are possible with such monsters, only the gun will calm them down once and for all."
GUA_convince_military:0 "Convince the Military"
GUA_convince_military_desc:0 "The former armies and officers of the conquered countries when Ubico was only the leader of Guatamela share our fear of the red tyrants, however, many do not support Ubico. If we truly want to unify our Empire, then everyone must be loyal and helpful to the figure of the Emperor! We will distribute amnesties to our former enemies and organize a Central American Grande Armée for this purpose."
GUA_que_faire:0 "Que Faire?"
GUA_que_faire_desc:0 "We have solved all the direct problems that concerned our Empire in record time, however one question keeps coming up now, what to do? Ubico admires Napoleon I, but also the Bonaparte family as a whole, including the Eagle's nephew, Napoleon III, who had a different approach to government than his uncle, although just as honorable. Our Emperor must now choose which of the two venerable Emperors we should follow to best run our Empire..."
GUA_first_empire_larp:0 "L'Empire Autoritaire"
GUA_first_empire_larp_desc:0 "The Emperor chose to follow Napoleon, the first of the name, as his model. It was a natural choice because Napoleon is the founder of the Bonaparte legend, the only man to have brought all of Europe to its feet and to lead his nation to a glory that it would never know after Napoleon. It is a man like him that we need for Central America, a strong, popular and charismatic Caesarist leader, Ubico is obviously the man for the job."
GUA_second_empire_larp:0 "L'Empire Libéral"
GUA_second_empire_larp_desc:0 "If it is true that Napoleon I is much more prestigious than Napoleon III and his Second Empire, we must not forget the many efforts made by Napoleon III to modernize his country, guiding it through the Industrial Revolution, creating significant economic growth, recovering its lost glory following the defeat of the Eagle and allowing for much greater political freedom than under his ancestor. Central America also needs to be modernized and guided, fortunately, the wise Emperor Ubico is there for the people."
GUA_code_civil:0 "Le Code Civil"
GUA_code_civil_desc:0 "If there is one thing to remember from Napoleon's reign, it is the Civil Code, also called the Napoleonic Code. This very modern legal code has helped structure French society until today, the Code still being in place in the French Republic exiled in Algiers. To be really modern and faithful to the Bonapartes, our Empire must have its own Civil Code! It will be in great part copied from the French one but will contain some modifications to better accommodate Central America."
GUA_french_friend:0 "Retain Central American Characteristics"
GUA_french_friend_desc:0 "Although we are great admirers of France and the French, we are also proud to be Central Americans. So the best solution to define the culture of our Empire is to create a culture that blends our Central American traditions with the French culture of the Bonapartes! In this way we will honor France and the Emperor of the French while remembering our origins and customs."
GUA_french_cuck:0 "Bring In the Superior Culture"
GUA_french_cuck_desc:0 "Napoleon's French culture is without a doubt the superior culture, far above the Central American one. Our Empire must be faithful to the Emperor and to France, therefore we must work to adopt the French culture and replace the old Central American culture which has no place in our Empire that would make Napoleon proud."
GUA_french_settlers:0 "Attract French Settlers"
GUA_french_settlers_desc:0 "Our Empire is now a proud bastion of French culture and our people have come to terms with this new reality. As for our French brothers, they have seen their home fall into the clutches of the Reds and many have fled to the deserts of Algeria where life is hard for many. We offer them the opportunity to come and settle in Central America where they will find a real oasis of opportunity!"
GUA_limited_liberalisation:0 "Limited Liberalisation"
GUA_limited_liberalisation_desc:0 "A total liberalization would be a suicide while the movements of contestations against the Emperor unfortunately still exist, we must thus, like Napoleon II, introduce certain fundamental freedoms, such as that of expression or of press, but still supervise that the socialists and other contestants do not use our kindness to spread their nauseating ideals."
GUA_legislature_power:0 "Determine the Legislature Powers"
GUA_legislature_power_desc:0 "Every good ruler needs a legislature to assist him in the arduous task of managing his domain. However, the legislature is a double-edged sword, the politicians cannot be the only ones to hold the power and the sovereign must remain above in all cases. We must therefore determine how much influence the deputies and other elected officials will have on the politics of the Empire."
GUA_plebiscite:0 "Le Plébiscite"
GUA_plebiscite_desc:0 "One of the characteristics of the Napoleonic regime and a proof of its popularity and the adhesion of the masses to the cause of the Empire is undoubtedly the plebiscite, a way of asking the people their opinion on a question concerning them all to which they answer with 'yes' or 'no'. Emperor Ubico intends to use the plebiscite to create a real direct democracy while reinforcing his position and his privileged link with the people."
GUA_Loi_Ollivier_2:0 "The Second Loi Ollivier"
GUA_Loi_Ollivier_2_desc:0 "In 1864, Emile Ollivier proposed the famous eponymous law which ensured the right to strike to the workers of the Second Empire, a first for that time. Just like Ollivier before us, we must promote a Social Empire that helps all its citizens in need and leaves no one without help, our new Ollivier law will go further than the first one, by being inspired by the other social reforms of the Second Empire, by creating substitutes and social aids for the workers in addition to granting them of course the right to strike."
GUA_napy3_dream:0 "Napoleon III's Dream"
GUA_napy3_dream_desc:0 "We did it! After many reforms we have finally shaped an Empire as Napoleon III imagined it, a free and social Empire where every citizen has the right to express themselves and to contribute in their own way to the greatness of the Empire. There is no doubt that the nephew of Napoleon I looks kindly on our progress and is proud of us."
GUA_departements:0 "Create the Départements"
GUA_departements_desc:0 "Central America is an administrative mess, if we really want to bring freedom and create a strong centralized state in these lands, we must administratively reorganize our Empire into new departments just like the great Napoleon did with his French homeland."
GUA_military_legacy:0 "A Military Legacy"
GUA_military_legacy_desc:0 "Napoleonic France, surrounded by many countries hostile to its ideals and the Eagle, needed to be militarized to overcome the many trials that awaited it. Our Central American Empire is in a similar situation, from the American imperialists in the North to the Reds on our doorstep, we are surrounded by enemies, therefore our society must be as militarized as possible to ensure that our Empire never falls into hands hostile to our people."
GUA_renovation:0 "Complete Renovation of Central America"
GUA_renovation_desc:0 "Central America is unfortunately not developed enough to support an Empire as big and powerful as ours, a good part of our economy is still agrarian and have not even experienced industrialization yet. The Emperor cannot be satisfied with this status-quo! Great and extravagant renovation and modernization works must be carried out in the four corners of the Empire to bring it straight into the 20th century as soon as possible."
GUA_cult_of_personnality:0 "A Double Cult of Personality"
GUA_cult_of_personnality_desc:0 "In our Empire, a cult should not be led to only Napoleon or to only Ubico, but to the two sovereigns who deserve both admiration for their numerous exploits and conquests. In each administrative building there will be a picture of our Emperor next to one of the great Napoleon himself, the resemblance between the two men being striking from the first glance."
GUA_napy_dream:0 "A State to Make Napoleon Proud"
GUA_napy_dream_desc:0 "The changes that we have brought to Central America are considerable, it has gone from a collection of small, weak and revolution-plagued states to a true Napoleonic Empire, strong and modern. This result would never have been possible without the efforts and hard work of our Emperor Ubico who was guided by the model of the Emperor of the French, Napoleon I. Vive l'Empereur!"
GUA_conquest_larp:0 "Just Like Our Ancestors"
GUA_conquest_larp_desc:0 "We cannot stop there! Just as Napoleon did not stop at managing France alone, he boldly embarked on numerous campaigns throughout Europe for the glory of his nation and to spread the ideals of the French Revolution. Ubico, our heroic Emperor, will follow his example and will carve out his own legend that future generations will take as a model."
GUA_neutrality_fp:0 "Preserve Our Empire"
GUA_neutrality_fp_desc:0 "It will be a shame to waste all the efforts we have made and all the progress we have accomplished by getting bogged down in long and costly military campaigns. The preservation of our Empire should be our priority, thus we must announce our neutrality in foreign policy matters, hopefully war will never occur in our lands again."
GUA_russia:0 "Take Down Our 'Russia'"
GUA_russia_desc:0 "The Russian campaign was the one that marked the end of the Napoleonic epic, the winter cold, the vastness of Russia and the loose scorched earth of the Russians having gotten the better of the Emperor's army. We must avenge the Emperor! Of course we cannot attack Russia from where we are, but in the West the Mexican giant is in every way similar to Russia - an untethered hegemon seeking to subjugate our proud people. The campaign of Mexico will be our campaign of Russia!"
GUA_britain:0 "Crush the Perfidious Albion"
GUA_britain_desc:0 "Where Napoleon never succeeded in going in spite of all his efforts, it is the coasts of the perfidious British, cowards hidden on their island behind their Royal Navy. The equivalent of the British for us are the Cubans, the dogs of the Americans, safely ensconced in their islands. Soon the Emperor's troops will march on Havana to avenge Napoleon! Onward!"
GUA_could_not_do:0 "What Napoleon Couldn't Do"
GUA_could_not_do_desc:0 "We have subdued the Russian Bear and the treacherous Alvion in our own way! We have not only equalled Napoleon, we have also fulfilled his dreams, which proves that we are his legitimate heir! Now that our Empire is secure, we could try to liberate our lands in Europe which have fallen into the hands of the hideous syndicalists..."
GUA_spain:0 "A New Peninsular Campaign"
GUA_spain_desc:0 "Spain was one of the many countries, and certainly the most important, to have been subjugated by Napoleon and to have known the spreading of the Civil Code on these lands. Spain is now a vast and chaotic battlefield between anarchists, Carlists and monarchists, but fortunately Ubico, the heir of the Bonapartes, intends to restore order for the glory of the Empire and our ancestors."
GUA_france:0 "Liberate our Home from the Reds"
GUA_france_desc:0 "The sacred lands of France where the Great Napoleon was born are occupied by the violent and dangerous socialists who exploit the people and the French land! Fortunately Ubico, the New Eagle, intends to liberate these lands and parade under the Arc de Triomphe under the applause of the Parisian people greeting their rightful savior!"
GUA_new_empire:0 "A New French Empire"
GUA_new_empire_desc:0 "We did it. Ubico is no longer the 'Little Napoleon of the Tropics' but the second Napoleon! A ceremony will be organized to crown our sovereign Emperor of the French at Notre-Dame as soon as possible. The legend of Ubico will remain forever engraved in history just like Napoleon's. Ubico finally became, after so much effort, the equal of his idol. Vive l'Empereur et vive le France éternelle!"
GUA_infrastcture_dev:0 "Improve Our Infrastructures"
GUA_infrastcture_dev_desc:0 "Our Empire is vast and the inhabitants are numerous, however, it is sometimes difficult to get from one end of the country to the other, the infrastructure being either damaged, old or simply non-existent. Our Emperor, always listening to the people, has become aware of this situation and has ordered great construction and modernization works throughout the Empire."
GUA_focus_people:0 "Focus on the Well-Being of Our People"
GUA_focus_people_desc:0 "The priority of a sovereign should be the good of his faithful people, our people have suffered a lot in the past, they deserve a rest and a quiet and peaceful life in our Empire under the paternal and benevolent eye of Emperor Ubico and his government."
GUA_nfa_remnants:0 "Welcome Refugees from the True France"
GUA_nfa_remnants_desc:0 "The legitimate French government in Algiers has fallen! Many French citizens are fleeing the red wave but are wondering where to go when they no longer have a homeland. Do not be afraid! The Empire of Ubico is the last bastion of the French way of life! Every Frenchman will be welcomed and granted citizenship without any conditions because we are brothers in blood."

# Exile Tree

GUA_nfa_start:0 "Le Second Exil"
GUA_nfa_start_desc:0 "We have once again been forced into exile away from our homeland by the socialists, this will be the last time! We are all that is left of France and we are proud of our heritage, never again will we trust the British dogs of the Entente who do not care about the fate of France and its people. We must now tame the savage lands of Central America to ensure a future for our eternal France..."

GUA_not_lost_yet_desc:0 "The French will always resist to the occupier! Whether it is the vile Kraut, the British traitor or the red tyrant, we will never again bow our heads to anyone! The Resistance will endure no matter what and France will rise from the ashes! Au pas mes amis, la victoire finale est proche!"
GUA_crush_false_emperor:0 "Deal with the False Emperor Sympathizers"
GUA_crush_false_emperor_desc:0 "The false Emperor Ubico, who dared to compare himself to the great Napoleon, has surprisingly many supporters among the locals, pretending to be French, but also among the French exiles who are grateful to the usurper for having 'welcomed' us in Central America. Such ideas have no place in our France and all those who adhere to them must be convinced that they are false, one way or another..."
GUA_not_lost_yet_2:0 "...Ne Doit Pas S'Eteindre et Ne S'Eteindra Pas!"
GUA_not_lost_yet_2_desc:0 "Some of our French compatriots have expressed defeatist feelings, saying that we will never again see our beautiful Paris or that we will never manage to settle in Central America to rebuild our civilization. These feelings have no place here! Impossible is not French, and no matter what obstacles are placed in our way, we will continue to advance towards glory and the final victory! Vive la France!"
GUA_silence_locals:0 "Silence the Locals"
GUA_silence_locals_desc:0 "In addition to Ubico's supporters, the local protest movements, whether nationalist, democratic, socialist or other, have also gained in popularity and are committing barbaric acts of terrorism in the four corners of the French Republic since our coup. A large part of our exiles are soldiers who were trained to manage this kind of revolt in colonial Africa, their experience will be of great help to us here."
GUA_our_base:0 "Notre Base"
GUA_our_base_desc:0 "Some say we should stay here and create a new France on these lands, but Central America is a perfect launching pad for a second, successful reconquest of the Métropole! We will militarize this base and build an army worthy of the name, and then we will march merrily through the streets of Paris where the people are impatiently waiting for deliverance from socialist tyranny!"
GUA_our_home:0 "Notre Maison"
GUA_our_home_desc:0 "To embark on a second campaign to try to take back our European lands would be suicidal and would have a disastrous result, this is a terrible reality but very real. We are not lost though! We will recreate France here in the wilds of Central America, our new home, for that we will have to make heavy decisions, however, no cost is too great for the glory of France!"
GUA_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Conscription of the Locals"
GUA_mass_conscription_desc:0 "The locals want to be real French? well, let them be, we will make their wish come true! Any man who can hold a rifle will be sent as soon as possible to the nearest training camp! Everyone must know how to devote himself if we want to see Paris liberated one day."
GUA_mass_militarisation:0 "Mass Militarisation of the Jungles"
GUA_mass_militarisation_desc:0 "Most of the land in Central America is inhospitable and frankly useless for the reconquest, our final objective.

Vive la France!"
GUA_segregation:0 "Segregation for Stability"
GUA_segregation_desc:0 "The people who inhabit these lands are hostile to our government and our people, they see us as foreign invaders who have come to plunder their resources and destroy their traditions, already too many crimes committed by these barbarians against the French have been recorded. This situation can no longer last, we are here in France, a system of segregation between the French and the others will be put in place based on the South African and American models to ensure that a bright future awaits France."
GUA_frenchisation:0 "Frenchize These Lands"
GUA_frenchisation_desc:0 "If we really want to create a new France here, then this land must become truly French as quickly as possible, both physically and spiritually. The French language will be the only valid language throughout the country, education will be fully republican, a strict separation between churches and states will be put in place... These are only a few of the measures taken, many others are waiting, soon the very notion of Central America will be purely geographical."

GUA_louis_michel_aury_desc:0 "Louis-Michel Aury was a privateer and intrepid French explorer whose plan was to conquer the wilds of Central America for his country, France. We have gone further, Central America is not a colony or a vulgar overseas territory, Central America is now France and will remain so as long as destiny allows! Never again will we go into exile far from home!"

GUA_nfa_home:0 "Notre Maison"
GUA_nfa_home_desc:0 "To embark on a second campaign to try to take back our European lands would be suicidal and would have a disastrous result, this is a terrible reality but very real. We are not lost though! We will recreate France here in the wilds of Central America, our new home, for that we will have to make heavy decisions, however, no cost is too great for the glory of France!"
GUA_nfa_segregation:0 "Segregation for Stability"
GUA_nfa_segregation_desc:0 "The people who inhabit these lands are hostile to our government and our people, they see us as foreign invaders who have come to plunder their resources and destroy their traditions, already too many crimes committed by these barbarians against the French have been recorded. This situation can no longer last, we are here in France, a system of segregation between the French and the others will be put in place based on the South African and American models to ensure that a bright future awaits France."
GUA_nfa_base:0 "Notre Base"
GUA_nfa_base_desc:0 "Some say we should stay here and create a new France on these lands, but Central America is a perfect launching pad for a second, successful reconquest of the Métropole! We will militarize this base and build an army worthy of the name, and then we will march merrily through the streets of Paris where the people are impatiently waiting for deliverance from socialist tyranny!"
GUA_nfa_resistance:0 "La Résistance"
GUA_nfa_resistance_desc:0 "The French will always resist to the occupier! Whether it is the vile Kraut, the British traitor or the red tyrant, we will never again bow our heads to anyone! The Resistance will endure no matter what and France will rise from the ashes! Au pas mes amis, la victoire finale est proche!"
GUA_code_civil_idea:0 "Le Code Civil"
GUA_code_civil_idea_desc:0 "If there is one thing to remember from Napoleon's reign, it is the Civil Code, also called the Napoleonic Code. This very modern legal code has helped structure French society until today, the Code still being in place in the French Republic exiled in Algiers. To be really modern and faithful to the Bonapartes, our Empire must have its own Civil Code! It will be in great part copied from the French one but will contain some modifications to better accommodate Central America."
GUA_social_empire:0 "L'Empire Social"
GUA_social_empire_desc:0 "In 1864, Emile Ollivier proposed the famous eponymous law which ensured the right to strike to the workers of the Second Empire, a first for that time. Just like Ollivier before us, we must promote a Social Empire that helps all its citizens in need and leaves no one without help, our new Ollivier law will go further than the first one, by being inspired by the other social reforms of the Second Empire, by creating substitutes and social aids for the workers in addition to granting them of course the right to strike."
GUA_heir_napoleon:0 "The True Heir of Napoleon"
GUA_heir_napoleon_desc:0 ""
GUA_napy1_idea:0 "A State to Make Napoleon Proud"
GUA_napy1_idea_desc:0 "The changes that we have brought to Central America are considerable, it has gone from a collection of small, weak and revolution-plagued states to a true Napoleonic Empire, strong and modern. This result would never have been possible without the efforts and hard work of our Emperor Ubico who was guided by the model of the Emperor of the French, Napoleon I. Vive l'Empereur!"
GUA_napy3_idea:0 "Napoleon III's Dream"
GUA_napy3_idea_desc:0 "We did it! After many reforms we have finally shaped an Empire as Napoleon III imagined it, a free and social Empire where every citizen has the right to express themselves and to contribute in their own way to the greatness of the Empire. There is no doubt that the nephew of Napoleon I looks kindly on our progress and is proud of us."
GUA_personality_cult_idea:0 "Double Personality Cult"
GUA_personality_cult_idea_desc:0 "In our Empire, a cult should not be led to only Napoleon or to only Ubico, but to the two sovereigns who deserve both admiration for their numerous exploits and conquests. In each administrative building there will be a picture of our Emperor next to one of the great Napoleon himself, the resemblance between the two men being striking from the first glance."
GUA_two_culture_idea:0 "A Mix of Two Cultures"
GUA_two_culture_idea_desc:0 "Although we are great admirers of France and the French, we are also proud to be Central Americans. So the best solution to define the culture of our Empire is to create a culture that blends our Central American traditions with the French culture of the Bonapartes! In this way we will honor France and the Emperor of the French while remembering our origins and customs."
GUA_one_culture_idea:0 "The Superior Culture"
GUA_one_culture_idea_desc:0 "Napoleon's French culture is without a doubt the superior culture, far above the Central American one. Our Empire must be faithful to the Emperor and to France, therefore we must work to adopt the French culture and replace the old Central American culture which has no place in our Empire that would make Napoleon proud."

##Army Generals##

ARMY_GUA_JORGE_UBICO_CASTANEDA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 10, 1878, in Ciudad de Guatemala, Guatemala.\n§YMilitary Career:§WJorge Ubico Castañeda was a sports prodigy in his youth, excelling in cycling, swimming, horse riding, gymnastics, target shooting and the use of foil and sword for fencing. In 1897 he graduated from the Military academy at Alta Verapaz as a second lieutenant, and his sheer talent and intelligence managed to turn him into a Brigadier General by 1906 after taking part in the War of Totoposte. In 1923 he became War Secretary, and with Orellana's coup, he became chief of the secret police and Vice President.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He has expressed profound disagreements with Orellana, and despite being Orellana's VP, Ubico stands to be one of Orellana's main rivals in the political scene."
ARMY_JACOBO_ARBENZ_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 14, 1913, in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala.\n§YMilitary Career:§WJuan Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán wanted to study to become an economist or an engineer in his youth, however his father's morphine addiction drove his family to financial ruin. The opening of scholarships for the Escuela Politécnica, a military academy in San Juan Sacatepéquez, convinced him to join the institution in 1932 as the only way to sustain his family. He has since then become an exceptional student, reaching the rank of First Sergeant of the Company of Knight-Cadets, a post that has only been achieved by 4 other students in the last 12 years. His talent gained him the respect of the staff of the academy, including the American headmaster, John Considine. Árbenz graduated in 1935, and he has since then served as a teacher in the academy while having the respect of most of the army staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Staunch Defender of Democracy."
ARMY_JUAN_JOSE_AREVALO_BERMEJO_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 10, 1904, in Taxisco, Guatemala.\n§YMilitary Career:§WJuan José Arévalo Bermejo has no formal military education to speak off, but with the recent rebellion, he has offered his services for the weakened military. Given his practice as a teacher, he has been quick to read and learn some of the basic military books, but he still has a long way to go before reaching the level of his predecessors.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Staunch Defender of Democracy."
ARMY_JOSE_MARIA_ORELLANA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 11, 1872, in El Progreso, Guatemala.\n§YMilitary Career:§WJosé María Orellana Pinto graduated the Escuela Politécnica in 1890 as a second lieutenant and as a topographic engineer from the Escuela Facultativa de Ingeniería in 1895. During the presidency of Estrada Cabrera, he was promoted to Brigadier General, and was present when in 1907 a couple of terrorists tried to assassinate president Cabrera, managing to survive the encounter unscathed and undeterred. After overthrowing Cabrera, he has held the post of President and has promoted himself to Field Marshall to operate the army more effectively from his new position of power.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Military wing of the Partido Liberal."
ARMY_LAZARO_CHACON_GONZALEZ_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 27, 1873, in Zacapa, Guatemala.\n§YMilitary Career:§WLázaro Chacón González joined the Escuela Politecnica as soon as he came of age and led a rather unremarkable military career up to 1920, where he was imprisoned for joining the Unionistas. He was set free by Orellana in 1921, and would later become Chief of the Honour Guard from 1922 to 1926 and was later promoted to Army General by Orellana himself.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Rumours say Gonzalez is member of a Central American lodge of Theosophists, but there's no substantial evidence to support this.\n- Affiliated to the Unionista Party."

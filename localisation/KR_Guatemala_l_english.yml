POLITICS_JOSE_MARIA_ORELLANA_DESC:0 "Orellana's military dictatorship beginning in 1921 has grown stagnant, with both him and his cabinet exhausted with constantly having to deal with protests against his presidency, social uprisings, and people wishing for true democracy to be returned. His main focus of building the economy and fighting illiteracy has also begun to slow down over time due to some sort of opposition from one side or another. Guatemala grows tired and demands change which Orellana cannot bring in the countries current state, and a shakeup could make him meet his undesirable fate..."
POLITICS_UBICO_NAPOLEON_DESC:0 "Born to Guatemala's upper class in 1878, Jorge Ubico Castañeda has long held a silver spoon in his hand. Receiving private tutoring as a boy and higher education overseas in Europe and the United States, his pathway to high success was paved at a young age. At 19, he joined the Guatemalan army upon being granted a commission due to his familial ties, and began his meteoric rise to the top from there. All along the way, the young Ubico looked to one man as his inspiration: Napoleon Bonaparte, deposed Emperor of France. As he grew older and achieved his dreams and more, Ubico began to take this fascination even farther, actively modeling his own image and mannerisms after the ‘Little Colonel.’ Now, ruling over all of Central America, Ubico has taken this obsession one step farther, fashioning himself as Jorge I, Emperor of Central America, while modeling this Lating American state on the now-collapsed First French Empire. Frequently remarking to his companions on how similar he and the long-dead Frenchman are, both in looks and personality, many within his cabinet have taken issue with this ‘admiration.’ Nonetheless, they can do little to stop this ‘Little Napoleon of the Tropics’, for absolute power is already within his reach..."

### Events ###
guatemala.1.t:0 "Intro to Guatemala"
guatemala.1.d:0 "Guatemala's political chaos started in 1898, when Manuel Estrada Cabrera came into power. Cabrera's “Liberal” party had a deep control over the government, with all elections up until 1920 being rigged towards the Liberal party under Cabrera. This period also vastly increased the influence of the United Fruit Company, an American owned business focused on increasing the amount of exports towards America for cheaper prices.\n\nThis changed in 1920, when the Liberal party faced extreme opposition following earthquakes in 1918 that destroyed the industry Cabrera had setup. His lack of response resulted in the Conservatives within the country forming the Unionist Party, with the people running the party consisting of José Azmitia, Tácito Molina, Eduardo Camacho, Julio Bianchi and Emilio Escamilla, while also being supported by the Catholic church within Guatemala.\n\nThe Unionist Party prepared the “Three-Fold Act”, which was the founding policy of the party, and they distributed these in Guatemala City on the New Year of 1920. This led to an extreme rise of the popularity of the Unionists, with protests occurring outside the capital on March 11th, 1920, with the crowd being fired upon and the populace left more angered than before. The final straw was in 1920, when Adrián Vidaurre, President of the National Assembly, declared Cabrera unfit to rule and deposed him, though still facing fierce resistance from Cabrera's supporters. They thereby made Carlos Herrera President of Guatemala.\n\nHerrara balanced a very careful political tightrope due to him having Liberal aligned views while representing the Unionist Party. This tightrope snapped in 1921, when he critically upset the Liberal party by refusing to offer concessions the UFC, resulting in a military coup led by José María Orellana. He represented the needs and demands of the Liberal Party, offering concessions to the UFC the following year.\n\nThe political situation has completely stagnated since then, with Orellana ruling over his regime while balancing the needs of both the left and right. Guatemala now stands frozen..."
guatemala.1.a:0 "Orellana is eternal."

guatemala.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits us!"
guatemala.2.d:0 "Black Monday has hit the United States, making their economic recession even worse. Ripples are being felt all across Central America, our crops remain unsold and US companies shrink in size to avoid bankruptcy."
guatemala.2.a:0 "What will this mean for Guatemala?"

guatemala.3.t:0 "Legal Issues"
guatemala.3.d:0 "Several peasants sued the United Fruit Company and certain provincial governors on flimsy grounds such as having their land sold by other parties without their knowledge, local governors seizing their land for the UFC without sensible reason, and ignoring the last wills for heirless people. It is obvious that the socialists pressured these peasants, instructing them to push their claims and helping them with the legal fees."
guatemala.3.a:0 "Listen to their pleas, return the land and try to do something about corruption."
guatemala.3.b:0 "These are surely just made up excuses!"

guatemala.4.t:0 "The American Civil War"
guatemala.4.d:0 "The American Civil war has broken out! Our biggest trading partner disappeared almost overnight. UFC officials are scrambling to save as much as they can in the chaos, selling off assets to stabilise their situation. Their support for Orellana has weakened considerably; a dark cloud now looms on the horizon of Guatemala."
guatemala.4.a:0 "Guatemala will survive."

guatemala.5.t:0 "Letter of the 311"
guatemala.5.d:0 "A group of democrats and socialists, mainly composed of university students, wrote a letter designated to President Orellana asking for his resignation and for free elections to start as soon as possible. Orellana knows his support dwindled and the democratic movement militarised and started talks with the socialists to declare open revolt to bring 'freedom' to Guatemala, this letter just being the tipping point of the tensions. If the government rejects this apparently 'heart-felt' letter coming from the future of Guatemala, civil war is all but inevitable."
guatemala.5.a:0 "Start preparing for elections as soon as possible, to avert disaster."
guatemala.5.b:0 "This is just a socialist conspiracy! Guatemala will not be corrupted!"

guatemala.6.t:0 "Ubico's Coup"
guatemala.6.d:0 "Seeing the weakness of Orellana and the inevitable elections that would bring socialists into government, the popular hardline general Jorge Ubico Castañeda has entered the capital with his loyal army and deposed Orellana. As soon as the news hit the country, the democratic-socialist coalition, the Revolutionary Action Party, started taking direct control of several cities and declared Ubico's regime illegitimate, starting a civil war. Some of the more moderate people, appalled by Ubico's power grab, joined their cause."
guatemala.6.a:0 "Ubico will save us from socialism!"

guatemala.7.t:0 "Ubico's Speech to the People"
guatemala.7.d:0 "Several days after the coup, as he managed to stabilise his rule in the capital, Ubico gave a speech to the people of Ciudad de Guatemala:\n'Fellow Guatemalans, I come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason. Let no Guatemalan deny the perils of our time. While we battle one another, divided by the petty strife of our common history, the tide of a greater conflict is turning against us, threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished. It is time for us as individuals to set aside our long-standing feuds and unite. The tides of an unwinnable war are upon us, and we must seek refuge upon higher ground, lest we be swept away by the flood.\nThe United States of America is no more! Whatever semblance of unity and protection it once provided is a phantom, a memory. With our enemies left unchecked, who will you turn to for protection? The devastation wrought by the socialists is self-evident. We have seen our cities occupied by the National Progress Party. We have seen firsthand our friends and loved ones shackled by them. Unprecedented and unimaginable though they may be, these are the signs of our time.\nThe time has come, my fellow Guatemalans, to rally to a new banner. In unity lies strength. Out of the many we shall forge an indivisible whole, answering only to a single throne, and from that throne, I shall watch over you.'\nThe booing of the supporters of the Democrats were drowned in the standing ovations of the crowds."
guatemala.7.a:0 "We will fight for Guatemala! For Ubico!"

guatemala.8.t:0 "Opening Strategies"
guatemala.8.d:0 "As the chaos throughout the country subsided, vast areas have ended up controlled by the National Progress Party. They are trying to expand their position in an aggressive manner, and underground cells have formed in most cities that still are nominally loyal to us. What would be the best course of action?"
guatemala.8.a:0 "Secure the temporary borders, not one mile will be ceded!"
guatemala.8.b:0 "Focus on rooting out opposition in loyalist lands."

guatemala.9.t:0 "Choosing a Target"
guatemala.9.d:0 "[getgua8], the military staff had to decide their strategy for the war. Would they advance directly on the mountainous makeshift rebel capital of Quetzaltenango, ending the rebellion fast but in a very costly assault, or try to starve the rebels by moving onwards to Ciudad de Belize and then cut them off from the Mexican border, isolating them?"
guatemala.9.a:0 "They will fall like flies, onward to Quetzaltenango!"
guatemala.9.b:0 "We shouldn't waste honourable Guatemalan lives in vain, starve the rebels into submission."

gua_8_d1:0 "After we secured our borders"
gua_8_d2:0 "After Ciudad de Guatemala and other urban centres were cleared of any Democratuc presence"

guatemala.10.t:0 "The Siege of Ciudad de Belize"
guatemala.10.d:0 "As the rebel defenses are overstretched, the concentrated blow to their main port in Belize went by with no issues. We registered barely any losses, and already started marching to the Mexican border to encircle whatever remains of the rebel forces, as their resources grow scarcer. While it is obvious to all parties involved that Mexico heavily assists the rebellion, the spineless socialists will surely not declare war to protect their proteges, even when their means of supporting the rebels will disappear."
guatemala.10.a:0 "The rebels know their demise is imminent."

guatemala.11.t:0 "The Assault on the Capital"
guatemala.11.d:0 "As our troops were finishing securing the border with Mexico, the rebels moved against Ciudad de Guatemala! This time it was them pouring all their resources into a final attack to make us flee from the capital and break our will. With a good chunk of our forces guarding the western border, this fight will be a hard one. Some generals even suggested letting them in the capital, fighting them in the streets, buying time for our forces to occupy the now virtually defenseless rebel land."
guatemala.11.a:0 "We will never let them enter Ciudad de Guatemala!"
guatemala.11.b:0 "It would be better for our long term goals to dye our capital red with blood."

guatemala.12.t:0 "The End of the Civil War"
guatemala.12.d:0 "After weeks of fighting in the streets of Ciudad de Guatemala, our troops managed to return to the capital, encircling the rebels, forcing their surrender. Our victorious president called for a parade the very next day. Through the bloody streets of Guatemala, the troops paraded valiantly, holding the Guatemalan flag up high, to the cheers of the people, who can taste peace at last. [getgua12d]"
guatemala.12.a:0 "[getgua12a]"
gua_12_d2:0 "The government started working towards making the civil war just a painful memory, and continue the path to a better Guatemala, as they did for the last 18 years, all under the guiding hand of Orellana, our dear president."
gua_12_d1:0 "The government already started working on plans to help the country heal and recover, preparing to enter a new era, all under the guiding hand of Ubico."
gua_12_a2:0 "Long live our President!"
gua_12_a1:0 "Peace, at last. Praise Ubico!"

guatemala.13.t:0 "A Statue for Our Victor"
guatemala.13.d:0 "As Ciudad de Guatemala is being rebuilt, the people (mainly high-class aristocracy) expressed their earnest desire for a statue dedicated to Ubico, to immortalise his role as the man who stopped the socialists from ruining Guatemala. It would be built in the likeness of the heroes of old, with Ubico on a fine steed, holding his saber forward."
guatemala.13.a:0 "We are truly grateful."

guatemala.14.t:0 "Rebuilding Ciudad de Guatemala"
guatemala.14.d:0 "As Ciudad de Guatemala was badly damaged by the final skirmish with the rebels, a big reconstruction project has commenced. Ubico wants to make the roads better and wider, to prepare Guatemala to be a capital for a larger Central America. However, more skeptical members of the government proposed a more sensible plan, to increase the defenses of the capital, to never again have such a bloodbath happen inside its borders."
guatemala.14.a:0 "Guatemala will never again be threatened, rebuild it with grandeur!"
guatemala.14.b:0 "Better to be conservative and protect the capital from further threats."

guatemala.19.t:0 "The Fate of El Salvador"
guatemala.19.d:0 "El Salvador has turned red! While we managed to put down the rebellion in our land, it seems they have failed. Our government has decided to prepare for war to liberate our brethren!"
guatemala.19.a:0 "To Arms!"

guatemala.23.d:0 "Ubico returned with an army of mercenaries paid for by the UFC! He landed in Belize and started to march towards the capital, while we're trying to prepare defenses to meet him in battle, even though we're very weakened due to the previous civil war."
guatemala.23.a:0 "Ubico defeats the government!"
guatemala.23.b:0 "Ubico is stopped, the revolution is saved!"

guatemala.69.t:0 "Naval Disaster"
guatemala.69.d:0 "As the Guatemalan navy finally had more than one lonely ship, they were sent out to do formation training. However, the sheer incompetence of the newly trained sailors resulted in one of the ships hitting the other during targeting training, forcing it to capsize. Fearful of an adverse reaction from the people that so much money has gone to waste, Ubico's propaganda machine tried to spin it as a reenactment of the battle of Trafalgar."
guatemala.69.a:0 "That’s an... interesting turn of events."

french_guatemala.1.d:0 "The Emperor, his army and his loyal subjects succeeded in securing Central America from all those who attacked our legitimate territory, from socialist revolutionaries to nationalist insurgents to liberal reformers, all united in their hatred of our Emperor. Now that we have defeated these pests, we can rest easy, however the question of the future of our Empire arises and our Emperor must make a choice that will be decisive for the nation.\n\nTwo choices are available to us, either we decide to create an Empire modeled on the one built by Napoleon I, the idol of our Emperor, as we initially planned, however Ubico also admires the Bonapartes as a whole, including Napoleon III, the nephew of Napoleon I and the leader of the Second French Empire, we could choose to model our regime on the state created by this venerable man, an empire that would be less militarized, more social and liberal but just as glorious.\n\nUbico is the only one who can choose, and he will decide in the end that..."

french_guatemala.1.b:0 "Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past, I will be the Liberal Emperor like Napoleon III!"

french_guatemala.2.t:0 "What power for the Legislature?"
french_guatemala.2.d:0 "With our decision to create a Liberal Empire comes the creation of a legislature that has the task of assisting Emperor Ubico in the administration of his vast domain. This legislature is based on that of the Second French Empire, and is composed of an Upper House, the Senate, and a Lower House, the Legislative Body.\n\nThese two chambers are elected by direct universal male suffrage by the citizens of the Empire who are over 20 years of age. Of course, several parties will have the right to run for office, but we have also taken over the concept of the 'official candidate' of the Second Empire, who benefits from advantages during their campaign as well as from a great visibility assured by the State, assuring us a comfortable majority in the chambers.\n\nHowever, a question that comes up more and more frequently is: what will be the real powers of the two chambers? Some of the Emperor's advisors have expressed their support for a Senate and a Legislative Body that would only have honorary powers and therefore would only be representative, while others express their desire to have chambers with legislative power, but with the creation of a special right of veto, which is only possessed by the Emperor himself and which he can use as he pleases, which will limits the powers of the chambers.\n\nUbico has considered both proposals and is now ready to make a choice."

french_guatemala.3.d:0 "It was a dark day we learned the fall of the legitimate French government of Algiers, as much for Emperor Ubico as for his subjects, our brothers had fallen once again against the reds thirsty for blood and exploitation. \n\nHowever, Ubico is not the kind of man to leave his brothers alone against the enemy! Upon hearing the news, the Emperor hastened to decree the immediate and unconditional reception of the French refugees fleeing with their families the chaos and devastation spread by the red hydra. Our appeal did not fall on deaf ears as the French flock to Central America, an Empire that reminds them of home, and where they will now live in peace. In addition to the many civilians, many military officers and venerable veterans such as Charles de Gaulle, François Darland, Maxime Weygand and Alphonse Juin also found their way to our lands, presenting themselves as leaders of the French exiles.\n\nUbico invited them to the Imperial palace to discuss and celebrate our friendship, the extravagant ceremony went perfectly and delighted the Emperor. However, some rumors say that happiness is not shared by the exiled officers who would plan to take power by deposing the one they call the 'false Emperor', of course, Ubico does not believe these rumors, our French war veteran friends are trustworthy!"
french_guatemala.3.a:0 "The French meet the French!"

french_guatemala.4.t:0 "The French Exiles attempt a coup!"
french_guatemala.4.d:0 "The citizens of the Imperial capital woke up today to the sound of soldiers' boots and French military marches, a sight that seems normal under Ubico's Central America but that hides a very different reality.\n\nTroops of French exiles led by Charles de Gaulle, François Darlan and many other French sub-officers surrounded the capital from all sides while Ubico was still sleeping peacefully. In a speech to his army, General De Gaulle denounced Ubico as a false Emperor and a usurper who thought he was a Frenchman without actually being one, he also proclaimed the lands of Central America as now belonging to the new French Republic, proclaiming himself interim President of the Republic, he demanded the immediate surrender of the Emperor's troops and said that he did not want to spill blood.\n\nUbico was shocked to hear this news when he woke up, he launched a radio appeal calling on the Imperial troops loyal to the Empire and the French exiles to join him as soon as possible in the capital to fight the insurgents.\n\nLoyal troops from the former Nicaragua, composed of both mainland French and Central American French, arrived a short time ago. A bloody battle that will determine the survival of the Empire will now take place..."

However, the Junta must designate a president following a vote among the officers for him to be truly legitimate, 3 main candidates are available.\n\nThe first and most obvious is General De Gaulle himself, a protégé of the Lion of Verdun, Pétain, and a distinguished officer, he is also a gifted and competent administrator. A second choice is Admiral Darlan, leader of the naval officers and war veteran, he will undoubtedly make an excellent president. The third choice is a civilian politician and lawyer, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, who has attracted the attention of the junta because he has defended our most controversial actions, designated as 'war crimes' by the international community, as justified and just, he will undoubtedly make a perfect figurehead president for the GFSN, the fact that he is a politician giving us more legitimacy.\n\nThe vote has just ended and the winner of the presidency is..."

GUA_dont_depose_me_desc:0 "As a new year starts, the 'Eternal' president Orellana has started the year giving a speech on the importance of state investment into several projects, namely industrialisation, improvements on the educational budget and improving the security forces capabilities to deal with socialist extremists. He has, however, not specified which would take priority over the others..."
GUA_ask_for_favours:0 "Industrial Investments"
GUA_ask_for_favours_desc:0 "In the modern world, only industrialized countries can be successful, and Guatemala has had for a long time a simple agrarian society. If we wish to move forward as a nation, we need to focus our efforts in an industrialisation program. Luckily, we can grant some small concessions to the UFC in order to get the capital we need to kickstart the project."
GUA_more_favours:0 "New Development Schemes"
GUA_more_favours_desc:0 "As our industrialisation program starts to bring us profits, we have devised a series of new development schemes that could change the way we construct our industrial parks and infrastructure. Our trade partners in the UFC have informed us that if we grant them a few more concessions, they'd continue to fund the development of Guatemala. Our country is lucky to have such a generous trade partner as the UFC!"
GUA_attract_migrants:0 "Attract Migrants"
GUA_attract_migrants_desc:0 "Guatemala is a small nation, and while we have one of the largest populations of Central America, our industrialisation efforts paired up with our old agrarian initiatives have stretched our work force very thin. We need to start promoting immigration to our country if we wish to continue our ambitious economic plans."
GUA_fix_illiteracy:0 "Greatly Increase Education Budget"
GUA_fix_illiteracy_desc:0 "Despite Orellana's past efforts, illiteracy rates in Guatemala are still cripplingly high. As our country improves, we now lack a professional workforce to operate the many new jobs, and while we can still import professionals from other countries, we have the potential to rely on ourselves if we deal with our illiteracy issues. With this objective in mind, Orellana has decreed a drastic increase in the education budget."
GUA_teachers_are_good:0 "Promote the Teaching Profession"
GUA_teachers_are_good_desc:0 "We won't solve illiteracy by just increasing education spending. We face a severe shortage of teachers and professors in our country, forcing many of current teachers to work overtime at multiple schools. With this in mind, we shall begin a massive increase to their wages in order to promote the teaching profession."
GUA_american_scientists:0 "Import American Know-How"
GUA_american_scientists_desc:0 "Our investments are proving to be successful, and our illiteracy rates are steadily dropping. However, change has been gradual, and we have a rather high demand at the moment for technical know-how. For the time being, we should hire American experts to meet our demand. At least our nation can produce sufficient professionals of its own."
GUA_border_posts:0 "Tighten the Mexican Border"
GUA_border_posts_desc:0 "Mexican support for Central American socialism could prove dangerous if left unchecked. We shall reinforce the border security procedures, and double the border patrols in order to protect our country from the vile Mexican influence. It will also assure us that the Syndicalist rebels don't cross the border towards Mexico in order to get training or rally support for their cause."
GUA_clamp_down:0 "Start Revoking Socialist Reforms"
GUA_clamp_down_desc:0 "Many politicians in the past have introduced socialist reforms that are now hindering our modernisation efforts and disrupt the activities of our trade partners, the UFC. We shall start eroding these reforms little by little until we can remove them completely from our work code, giving us greater freedom to carry out reforms without being hindered by such naïve concepts like 'welfare' or 'job security'."
GUA_more_propaganda:0 "Intensify Anti-Socialist Propaganda"
GUA_more_propaganda_desc:0 "Many citizens, fueled by syndicalist propaganda, have come to doubt our efforts to improve our fair nation. We need to remind our populace who makes our country great and who protects our nation from falling to godless syndicalism, and in order to do so we shall begin a massive propaganda campaign to remind our citizens of our duty to them and our nation."

GUA_death_letter_desc:0 "'(...)Guatemala cannot escape the democratic imperatives of our time.

GUA_anti_commie_coup:0 "Fuentes Restores Harmony"
GUA_anti_commie_coup_desc:0 "Juan José Arévalo, now former president of Guatemala, has inflicted Guatemala with a malaise only curable by Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes. Fuentes has assumed control of the country in a coup, and through Fuentes shall Guatemala prosper and rise from its fugue."
GUA_expose_agents_of_paris:0 "Expose the Agents of Paris"
GUA_expose_agents_of_paris_desc:0 "There is a phantom that possesses Guatemala; an evil jockey that threatens Guatemala. The hellscape of Paris has sent its demons to Guatemala, and infiltrated it; this may surprise the common man, but it is to be expected by Fuentes. Arévalo, the crook he is, has let the abominations handle his strings as an agent of Paris. Now is the time to snip the marionette’s ties and string him to something far less manipulative and far more painful."
GUA_ally_southern_autocrats:0 "Ally Fellow Anti-Socialists"
GUA_ally_southern_autocrats_desc:0 "While there are those blinded by the red poltergeist, with the light shined on the threat comes a signal to be broadcast. We have recognized a number of groups with the purpose of ripping apart the Syndicalist terror limb by limb, and thus we shall band together. As one we are strong, but as two and more, we become exponentially stronger."
GUA_support_or_oppose_mexico:0 "The Mexican Dilemma"
GUA_support_or_oppose_mexico_desc:0 "To our western border perches the grand caracara, Mexico; some say it seeks to bisect us like a snake, while others claim that a mutual understanding would profit both of our nations.\nAs Fuentes’ allies agree, Calles and his lackeys are an existential threat to the balance Fuentes seeks to spearhead, as do many of the other red banners in Mexico. Their proponents of ‘free’ and ‘uncorrupted’ democracy shall also be disregarded. Only agreeable stances, or the Mexican military, and even the strange and outlandish fringes in Mexican politics are acceptable."
GUA_stainless_steel_hand:0 "El Guantelete de Acero Inoxidable"
GUA_stainless_steel_hand_desc:0 "Guatemala may only succeed under an steel gauntlet; a control tighter than iron. Yet our steel must never stain, for with rust Guatemala will burst from the inside. We must maintain the armor of our nation. Fuentes shall guide Guatemala dutifully and cleanly."
GUA_control_congress:0 "Sever the Congressional Parasite"
GUA_control_congress_desc:0 "Under our suit of armor, one leech still sucks at our blood and at the same time attempts to pierce our plates. Congress, the last monument to the old era of Guatemala, prods our side, and with each day inactive lays more bloodlusting eggs to suck the soul from Guatemala. They must be cut down; cured, eradicated!"
GUA_deradicalize_students:0 "Exorcise Radicalism from the Students"
GUA_deradicalize_students_desc:0 "The youth of every era, in the past, the present, and most definitely in the future, has a knack for naivety and uninformed decision-making. Their lack of guard and tact around the truth of politicking has opened their bloodstream to infection and dirtiness; now they too must be shut down and cured of the plague in their blood: anti-Fuentes action."
GUA_control_the_people:0 "The People under our Supervision"
GUA_control_the_people_desc:0 "Sometimes naivety goes past the youth and breaches the hull of the common man. Our eyes must watch every facet of society, scanning for signs of the illness. Some literary nuts compare the ever-tightening supervision of the Fuentes government to Eric Blair’s novel ‘The Union in Forty Years.’ We guide Guatemala to safety and not stupidity."
GUA_every_pot_a_chicken:0 "A Chicken in Every Pot"
GUA_every_pot_a_chicken_desc:0 "In all of Latin America, improvement is either nonexistent or estranged; fields lack grain, wallets lack coinage, and pots lack chickens. Every chicken a pot, Fuentes preaches, for with food comes appetite for more; more improvement, more for Guatemala!"
GUA_expand_food_industry:0 "Domestic & Industrial Culinary Revival"
GUA_expand_food_industry_desc:0 "And now the fields shall flourish with all manners of crops integral for a renaissance of the Guatemalan culinary intelligence; influence from southerners and northerners, both foriegn and domestic. A well-fed populace is but a seed to a tree of greatness."
GUA_increased_living_standards:0 "Extend ‘La Prosperidad’ to All"
GUA_increased_living_standards_desc:0 "The aggressive expansion we embark on like Juan Ponce de León’s sailing shall now extend outwards.

GUA_a_cabinet_of_power_desc:0 "Congress has fallen, but Guatemala cannot rest on the shoulders of one man. A vambrace, perhaps, shall be suited to Fuentes’ unstained gauntlet. New ministers and men shall join the government to assist Fuentes."
GUA_guatemala_in_our_grip:0 "A Guatemala of Fidelity and Fraternity to Fuentes"
GUA_guatemala_in_our_grip_desc:0 "We began with strength, and shall toil on with the audacious advance forwards. Fuentes’ Guatemala stands proud. The Resplendent Quetzal shall spread its wings, now, for we shall fly into the future."

GUA_target_orellanists_desc:0 "Even in the wake of our victory, a noted amount of Orellanists still remain active against the country, and therefore, against our rule. In the pursuit of democracy, some must be excluded - and Orellanists fit the bill perfectly."
GUA_target_ubico:0 "Deal Ubicoites a Waterloo"
GUA_target_ubico_desc:0 "Ubico is a mistaken harlequin who thinks he can match up to Napoleon Bonaparte. He is a traitor to Guatemala, a clownfish who is toying with a French jellyfish. Ubico must be shown a decisive defeat, to spell out the idiot’s demise for him and his delusional followers."
GUA_ease_tensions:0 "Ease Tension with our People"
GUA_ease_tensions_desc:0 "How can one say there is a revolution, when many are against it? Tensions must cool and order kept, for the only way we can revolutionize Guatemala is through patience, lest we fall to the same folly of Orellana."

GUA_heavily_crackdown_on_ufc:0 "Raze UFC Operation"

GUA_reform_parties:0 "Reformation of the Political Parties"
GUA_reform_parties_desc:0 "Guatemala’s authoritarian streak has smudged the essential tool of the democratic process into obscurity: the political party. Parties provide platforms and orders for politicians to exercise the liberties of the democratic process, and without these parties, democracy is anarchy."
GUA_delete_corruption:0 "Liquidate ‘Los Vicios Corruptos’"
GUA_delete_corruption_desc:0 "Latin America is notorious for its tendency for corruption and diluting of the democratic process. Onlookers say Guatemala will befall the same path, but by cutting out the source of corruption, we may yet subvert the trend of democracy here."

democratic_guatemala.1.t:0 "First Elections of the Second Republic"
democratic_guatemala.1.d:0 "Today the people of the Second Republic of Guatemala have come out in force to vote in the first national elections under the new Constitution.In a crowded field four frontrunners have emerged. The first is Jacobo Arbenz, a former Army officer. While his detractors claim he harbors ambitions of autocracy, his promise of wide ranging land reform has hit a key with the masses and made him wildly popular.  Second in line stands Juan Jose Arevalo, a philosophy professor who has made equally ambitious promises of wide ranging social reforms and government reforms. This has also struck a chord in the countryside and has made him almost as popular if not just as popular as Arbenz. Third in line is Enrique Peralta Azurdia, a candidate favored by the military for his pro-defense statements. This popularity has made some fear that should he lose the military will force his appointment. The last candidate is Carlos Castillo Armas, a military man with unabashed authoritarian leanings. He has become a standard bearer of the cause of order over all and has declared his intention to “weed out Syndicalism root and stem” should he be  elected."

democratic_guatemala.5.t:0 "Reformation of Parties"
democratic_guatemala.5.d:0 "With the restoration of democracy in full swing the many parties that once made up Guatemala’s political landscape before Ubico have reemerged in one form or another. Some parties, like those on the left, have adapted to the rise of Syndicalism since their abolishment and as such are not quite the same as they once were, but it seems the electorate doesn't mind. The landscape itself however has changed much in the years since Ubico took power. The people have been, expectantly, more drawn to the parties pledging to work within the system which has given them an early edge over the others. However even Ubico had supporters and they have coalesced under the handful of far right parties. While some of them have pledged to work within the system there are those who explicitly seek to overthrow the Second Republic. While Democracy is triumphant today all Guatemalans know that Liberty is not a right, it’s something to be earned and protected. Time will tell if they will be successful a second time."
democratic_guatemala.5.a:0 "Democracy has prevailed!"

democratic_guatemala.1220.t:0 "Military Plots against Arevalo"
democratic_guatemala.1220.d:0 "Today rumors have reached the President of a military plot to overthrow him. This is not especially worrying as Arevalo has already had to quash 12 such plots in just the short time he has been in office. The difference however comes in that the plot has rapidly gained steam. Despite being just a few weeks old the plot has already roped in two generals and a not insignificant portion of the officer corps. The plotters appear to have been spooked by Arevalo’s labor reform program. They see it not as a necessity but as thinly veiled Syndicalism. They demand that Arevalo revoke his reforms at once before they ‘take what actions are necessary to save the body politic’."
democratic_guatemala.1220.a:0 "What choice do we have?"
democratic_guatemala.1220.b:0 "Dismiss the Plots"

democratic_guatemala.1210.t:0 "The Plot Grows"
democratic_guatemala.1210.d:0 "Our refusal to listen to the plotters demands and continued reforms has seemingly ‘convinced’ more military men of our crypto-Syndicalist leanings. We have gotten reports that plotters have infiltrated the National Police units within Guatemala City and even the Presidential Guard. This brings them dangerously close to being able to carry out their coup. To fight them now would be hard if not entirely impossible. That is why a growing number of members of our own government have pleaded with Arevalo to give in to their demands. They point out that the nation has just recovered from the previous coup and to stay so stubborn as to invite another would tarnish Arevalo’s reputation for all time."

democratic_guatemala.1210.b:0 "I'm not scared of some armchair generals"

democratic_guatemala.1230.t:0 "Military coups"
democratic_guatemala.1230.d:0 "Today at 5:30 am members of the National Police and 1st Infantry Division surrounded Guatemala City. Then, 15 minutes later they marched into the capital and swiftly moved to occupy important intersections, communications hubs and government buildings. They caught the city sleeping as they intended to and captured many of their objectives without firing a shot. It was a brief gunbattle with the few armed guards of the Treasury at 6:11am that woke the city up. Loyalists were quickly alerted to the ongoing coup and rallied to defend what was left. However by then there was not much left to defend and many of the loyalists were quickly disarmed and forced to surrender. When the Army finally reached the Presidential Palace at 6:30 they found the Palace full of low level officials, mostly secretaries and janitors and aides. The important politicians, most notable among them President Arevalo himself, had managed to slip through the cracks and escaped the city. Despite this missed opportunity that would doom any other coup it seems Arevalo has decided against raising an army against the coup as he has yet to reappear. Instead the new Government of National Salvation has established an iron grip over Guatemala City and the rest of the nation will not be long behind it."

GUA_strenghten_position:0 "Strengthen Our Position"
GUA_strenghten_position_desc:0 "Even some of Ubico's supporters doubt his position as Emperor, some seeing him as just a madman pretending to be what he is not. We will prove them wrong!

Our Emperor must now choose which of the two venerable Emperors we should follow to best run our Empire..."
GUA_first_empire_larp:0 "L'Empire Autoritaire"
GUA_first_empire_larp_desc:0 "The Emperor chose to follow Napoleon, the first of the name, as his model. It was a natural choice because Napoleon is the founder of the Bonaparte legend, the only man to have brought all of Europe to its feet and to lead his nation to a glory that it would never know after Napoleon.

GUA_second_empire_larp_desc:0 "If it is true that Napoleon I is much more prestigious than Napoleon III and his Second Empire, we must not forget the many efforts made by Napoleon III to modernize his country, guiding it through the Industrial Revolution, creating significant economic growth, recovering its lost glory following the defeat of the Eagle and allowing for much greater political freedom than under his ancestor. Central America also needs to be modernized and guided, fortunately, the wise Emperor Ubico is there for the people."
GUA_code_civil:0 "Le Code Civil"
GUA_code_civil_desc:0 "If there is one thing to remember from Napoleon's reign, it is the Civil Code, also called the Napoleonic Code.

GUA_plebiscite:0 "Le Plébiscite"
GUA_plebiscite_desc:0 "One of the characteristics of the Napoleonic regime and a proof of its popularity and the adhesion of the masses to the cause of the Empire is undoubtedly the plebiscite, a way of asking the people their opinion on a question concerning them all to which they answer with 'yes' or 'no'.

GUA_military_legacy_desc:0 "Napoleonic France, surrounded by many countries hostile to its ideals and the Eagle, needed to be militarized to overcome the many trials that awaited it. Our Central American Empire is in a similar situation, from the American imperialists in the North to the Reds on our doorstep, we are surrounded by enemies, therefore our society must be as militarized as possible to ensure that our Empire never falls into hands hostile to our people."
GUA_renovation:0 "Complete Renovation of Central America"
GUA_renovation_desc:0 "Central America is unfortunately not developed enough to support an Empire as big and powerful as ours, a good part of our economy is still agrarian and have not even experienced industrialization yet. The Emperor cannot be satisfied with this status-quo! Great and extravagant renovation and modernization works must be carried out in the four corners of the Empire to bring it straight into the 20th century as soon as possible."
GUA_cult_of_personnality:0 "A Double Cult of Personality"
GUA_cult_of_personnality_desc:0 "In our Empire, a cult should not be led to only Napoleon or to only Ubico, but to the two sovereigns who deserve both admiration for their numerous exploits and conquests.

We must avenge the Emperor! Of course we cannot attack Russia from where we are, but in the West the Mexican giant is in every way similar to Russia - an untethered hegemon seeking to subjugate our proud people. The campaign of Mexico will be our campaign of Russia!"
GUA_britain:0 "Crush the Perfidious Albion"
GUA_britain_desc:0 "Where Napoleon never succeeded in going in spite of all his efforts, it is the coasts of the perfidious British, cowards hidden on their island behind their Royal Navy.

In 1897 he graduated from the Military academy at Alta Verapaz as a second lieutenant, and his sheer talent and intelligence managed to turn him into a Brigadier General by 1906 after taking part in the War of Totoposte. In 1923 he became War Secretary, and with Orellana's coup, he became chief of the secret police and Vice President.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He has expressed profound disagreements with Orellana, and despite being Orellana's VP, Ubico stands to be one of Orellana's main rivals in the political scene."

The opening of scholarships for the Escuela Politécnica, a military academy in San Juan Sacatepéquez, convinced him to join the institution in 1932 as the only way to sustain his family. He has since then become an exceptional student, reaching the rank of First Sergeant of the Company of Knight-Cadets, a post that has only been achieved by 4 other students in the last 12 years. His talent gained him the respect of the staff of the academy, including the American headmaster, John Considine. Árbenz graduated in 1935, and he has since then served as a teacher in the academy while having the respect of most of the army staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Staunch Defender of Democracy."

### Subtype Descriptions ###
totalist_subtype_desc:0 "The term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. Totalism is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarization, centralization, and totalitarian transformation of society."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a pluralist form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenets of market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."

natsynd_subtype:0 "National Syndicalism"
natsynd_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Syndicalism)§!\n\nWidely known as National Syndicalism, often also as Social Nationalism, Charter Totalism, no-adjective Totalism or even Charterism is the world's newest, but also the fastest growing, leading ideology on the authoritarian end of the leftist spectrum. Tracing its roots as far back as to the writings of the highly influential Revolutionary Syndicalist Georges Sorel, and then later developed by many Interventionist Socialist movements such as the Italian 'Leagues of Revolutionary Action', National Syndicalism aims to reform society to the extent which has never been attempted or done before by any regime, government nor even religion. This, according to its proponents, can only be achieved by the mobilization of a truly mass movement of workers, one that shall be a true vanguard of the revolution and reject the delusions of the vanguardist party which has brought the failed revolutionary Lenin to the dustbin of history. Such a force shall overthrow the corrupt and decadent order, of liberalism, bourgeoisie and aristocracy, and usher in the total transformation of many a 'plutocratic' nations into true Proletarian Nations, emboldened in their productive, morally vigorous character thus aimed towards grander purposes through maximum cohesion, concentration of forces, iron discipline and utter ruthlessness. Economically, the ideals of National Syndicalism will unite economic classes into a program of national development and growth, enabled by the socialization of the economy and either united national character of various trade unions or one over-union serving the state. The Class War cannot unify the nation, and thus shall be replaced by Class Rejuvenation combining the forces of the lower and increasingly drawn towards Totalism middle class, together with unifying Imperialism yet combined with the Brotherhood of Nations, adhering to and respecting the Charter. Ultimately, the ideology which has been codified in the 'Totalist Charter' mainly drafted by Benito Mussolini, Italy's 'Dux Bellorum' who has galvanized the Socialists towards the First War; former British Conservative, visionary noble and founder of the Maximist group Oswald Mosley; and the intellectual of the Sorelians within the CGT Georges Valois, is often modified and unique to the specific character of the nation in which it is implemented, molded by the absolute and charismatic guidance of the Chairman."
authcom_subtype:0 "Communism"
authcom_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Communism)§!\n\nCommunism as a term has come to designate many varied ideological positions seeking to present an alternative to the dominant Anglo-French Syndicalist orthodoxy. While the term itself dates back to the 18th century, the vast majority of modern movements utilizing that mantle can trace its origins to the works and philosophy of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Although suffering a devastating blow following the failed Bolshevik Revolution, parties which subscribe to the Marxist, or sometimes even Leninist, tendency managed to integrate into the Communard and Unionist structures, becoming important players in the world of Socialist politics. The main tenets of Communist parties can be recognized in policies such as the rejection of utopianism, class conflict, dialectical materialism, seizure and redistribution of the means of production and the establishment of a temporary ‘Socialist’ state as a stepping stone towards the equal and classless vision of Communism. Although some parties may hold additional tenets, such as Vanguard leadership, the factional width present between Orthodox Marxists, National Communists, Leninists, Anarcho-Communists and Councilists guarantees that vital differences will always be present. Nonetheless, these disparate forces can all agree that the Capitalist age is coming to an end, and it is only a matter of time before the Proletariat of the entire world will unite to throw off its shackles."
sorelianism_subtype:0 "Sorelianism"
sorelianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Sorelianism)§!\n\nModern Sorelianism, while obviously having its core in the ideas proposed by the highly influential French political philosopher Georges Sorel, has been carried forwards into the Communard reality by the intellectual duo of Georges Valois and Édouard Berth. Sorelianism at first was born out of the revision and rejection of orthodox Marxism, for 'Socialism has died' due to the 'Decomposition of Marx'. Thus Sorel expanded on the theories of the French Anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, another monumental influence on Valois and Berth who founded the 'Cercle Proudhon', advocating that through direct action against the bourgoise enemy and the 'myth' of the general strike as expressed in Revolutionary Syndicalism shall the working class attain better living conditions. Yet the 'productive energy' of the bourgoise class, put into slumber due to the degenerating influence of the greatest evil which ever manifested in France, that being liberal democracy, will once again wake after the class war rejuvenates both the autonomous proletariat and the newly productive bourgoise. The disdain towards parliamentary democracy and secularist spirit can even be seen in Sorelians' support for Classicism in art. While the rejection of democracy led some Sorelians to support a revolutionary monarchy, especially those that originated from AF like Valois himself, such views were mostly dropped after the establishment of the Commune. Another important concept in Sorelianism is the exoltation of the warrior-individual, manifestation of true freedom when combined with devotion to the family, the weak and labour ethic. In a fully realized Sorelian society as expanded on by Valois such a group would serve as the ruling class, somewhere above the ordinary proletariat. The modern Sorelian duo continue to follow the core tenets of Sorel while introducing many elements unique to their thinking, such as Maurrasian Integral Nationalist influences carried from their days in Action Française, rabid Anti-Semitism, Berthian synthesis between Marxian materialism and Bergsonian metaphysics, creation of the Estates General of French Production and introduction of stable gold-backed currency as outlined by Valois' long-time collaborator Jacques Arthuys, slightly increased centralization compared to Sorel's original vision and the mixing of revolutionary syndicalism and corporatism. Sorelianism, despite being a distinct movement, laid the foundations for the eventual development of National Syndicalism into the wider Totalist Charter."
national_communism_subtype:0 "National Communism"
national_communism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Communism)§!\n\nWhile sometimes confused with movements that are rabidly nationalist, intentionally so by enemies of the tendency, the simplest definition of National Communism would be the desire to implement Marxist Communism or other forms of Socialism in accordance and respect to the local realities. The proponents of such method reject the entirely stateless internationalist vision and once again turn towards the oft ignored 'National Question, pondering with renewed energy how to combine their ideology with the preservation or restoration of particular aspects their native culture. The origins of National Communism can be found among the various minority activists within the Bolshevik movement, such as Ukraine's Vasyl Shakhrai, Tatarstan's Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev and Crimea's Ismail Firdevs, who became disillusioned with the continuation of cultural chauvinism so ever-present during the oppressive imperial era. Another important voice in the melding of national interests with communism, unrelated to the groups which operated within the Russian Communist Party, is the Borotbist movement led by Alexander Shumsky. National Communists carry the torch of Marx while noting that his position of workers having 'no country' refers to the globalized bourgeoisie states, machines for exploitation against which the policy of full independence or wide national autonomy in cooperation with new Socialist cores ought to be employed. For true Socialism, touching upon every aspect of local tradition, cannot be achieved unless the 'colonized' groups break the chains of their metropolitan masters. While to many Communists every National Communist represents a certain 'national deviation', the tendency itself does not merge its goals with explicit nationalism represented by the usual meaning of such term. That is not to say certain groups do not increase their reliance on the 'national' part of their ideology. The National Communist term has also been applied to Marxist thinkers which do advocate an alliance with rabidly nationalistic and chauvinistic groups inside their nations, much to the chagrin of conventional representative of the ideology who call such positions 'Social-Reactionism', the most famous of them being the German Communist Heinrich Laufenberg, who developed the idea described by him as 'National Bolshevism'."
technocratic_socialism_subtype:0 "Technocratic Socialism"
technocratic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Technocratic Socialism)§!\n\nWhile the basic understanding of Technocratic Socialism, often confused with the Technocratic movement despite being two distinct entities with differing origins, could lead some to think it's a mere combination of technological advancement with socialist policies such a view would be particularly limited. For the technocratic tendency within Socialism is often born out of the very material understanding of the world through the use of the political ideology, although some say pure science of Marx, developed by the Father of Communism and further expanded upon by a diverse group of thinkers. The most important of the groups fitting such a descriptor is the Bolshevik 'Proletkult', the 'Proletarian Culture' movement having its origins in the ideological Vpered, or 'Forward', faction of their party. Led by the coalition of Anatoly Lunacharsky, a close friend of V.I. Lenin and the People's Commissar of Education during the Revolution, Alexander Bogdanov, one of Lenin's greatest rivals for a time and the man around whom the original Vpered coalesced, and Valerian Polyansky, editor-in-chief of proletarian literature and progenitor of Soviet censorship. The main principle of the Proletkult is their devotion to progress and ardent 'religious' belief in the collective society and Scientific Socialism, a construct which gave birth to the Proletarian Religion and the 'God-Building' principle. Based on the Auguste Comte's 'Religion of Humanity' the Proletkultists deify the Socialist Enlightenment given form as a new faith, one capable of replacing the corrupt old lore of the dying bourgeoisie world, a plane in which even immorality may be achieved according to A. Bogdanov and his experiments with blood transfusion. Another important thinker of the Proletkult, although distinct from the Lunacharsky group, is Aleksei Gastev. Proponent of a Syndicalist-Technocratic Soviet system breaking with the orthodox Leninist tradition, Gastev is the creator of the 'Ustanovka' concept, aiming to install a revolutionary mental attitude within Russia through the use of social engineering and scientific management drawing upon the works of Frederick Taylor. With the great mission of labour overseen by a technically minded avant-garde the proletariat shall move time itself forward."
georgian_socialism_subtype:0 "Georgian Socialism"
georgian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Georgian Socialism)§!\n\nGeorgian Socialism could be understood as an adaptation of Leninist Bolshevism to the context of a reborn Georgia, according to National Communistic principles. Such a break with Leninist orthodoxy is the brainchild of Ioseb 'Koba' Jughashvili, a former fighter in the Russian Revolution who escaped to his native Georgia in the aftermath of the White victory in the Civil War. While Georgian Socialism upholds elements shared by many Communist parties claiming the legacy of the Revolution, such as a focus on class warfare, party's doctrinal purity, wealth redistribution, rapid industrialization, and rural collectivization, the differentiating parts make it distinct from other exiles such as mainstream Zinovievites. For Koba's socialism is an ideology rabidly anti-Russian, vowing to never again let his homeland be at the whim of the Muscovite chauvinists. To that extent a massive campaign for the rebirth of Georgian culture must be undertaken, so that the natives of Koba's domain can have the strength to oppose the foreign oppressors. Another key point in Georgian Socialism is the total control of the state and the ultimate devotion of the people towards it, as represented and hinged upon the figure of Chairman Jugashvili, viewed as the incarnate form of his Sakartvelo. Lastly, Georgian Socialists posit a program of unification of the native ethnoses of Caucasus, bound together by their inner strength developed through the centuries spent combating the Russo-Turkish imperialists. While some foreign observers point out similarities between Ioseb Jughashvili's movement and the emerging 'Totalist Charter' such comparisons are quickly shot down by the devout adherents of the Georgian ideology, still claiming that theirs is a genuine adaptation of true Marxist principles.

mladorossi_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Social Monarchism)§!\n\nWhile Monarchism and Socialism are typically contradictory ideologies, several movements have embraced a seemingly impossible mix of Monarchism and Socialism. Movements such as the Mladorossi - who call for a form of ‘Labor Monarchy’ - are followed by many other varied Socialist regimes who have decided to keep their Monarchs around as figureheads, though some rare examples of a monarch truly invested in the Socialist system do exist. The Mladorossi themselves seek to combine ideas of Russian Monarchism with the Soviet Socialist system, fusing Marxist principles with Russian Nationalism and Traditionalism under the embrace of a Red Crown and Aristocracy and united by Orthodox faith."
autocratic_socialist_subtype:0 "Autocratic Socialism"
autocratic_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Autocratic Socialism)§!\n\nAutocratic Socialist regimes are highly authoritarian dictatorships that (at least on paper) adhere to socialist principles. They are notably varied, but can usually be seen with some form of command economy, emphasis on militarism, are often nationalist or use patriotism as a tool of the state, and are frequently at odds with more mainline Charter Totalists. While their commitment to Socialist revolutionary principles is usually questionable at best, these regimes still maintain socialism as the official state ideology, and go to lengths to paint their government red - even if the government is nothing short of a total dictatorship."
red_junta_subtype:0 "Red Junta"
red_junta_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Red Junta)§!\n\nMilitary juntas with explicitly leftist slants are as diverse as their non-red counterparts, but what unites them is a professed need for the military to 'defend' socialism within the nation they've taken root in. While the authority of generals and soldiers now starts to supplant the authority of commissars and secretaries, the Red Junta will do its utmost to remove perceived corrupt civilian bureaucrats and subversive elements that would misuse the revolutionary government's wheels of power for their own ends. This removal typically involves a deeply autocratic police state and waves of martial build-up so that the junta's power may eventually morph into something less militant once the deeds are done, or, in less generous regimes, for the junta to permanently solidify its grip on the nation. Despite this new wave of militant authoritarianism, however, socialist governance commonly remains in Red Juntas alongside the crackdowns, with the lower classes still afforded the welfare and various protections they were promised before the junta's assent into power."
caponism_subtype:0 "Mafioso Socialism"
caponism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Mafia Socialism)§!\n\nMafioso Socialism, often just called Caponism or Caponeism after its leading ‘theorist’, is the ideology ascribed to notable crime lord and pseudosocialist Alphonse Capone, who rose to political prominence within the American Socialist movement during the Civil War. Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."

Harsh towards any form of Liberalism, Counter-Revolutionary action, or any other ideas deemed an obstacle to the state, only through total loyalty to the Party and to the Supreme Leader can one reap the benefits of the state, and all those who fail in these duties are branded enemies of the state without remorse."
nazbol_subtype:0 "Molotovism"
nazbol_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Molotovism)§!\n\nVyacheslav Molotov's brand of communism has been called many different things, be it National Bolshevism, Russian National Bolshevism, Molotovism, Marxism-Leninism-Molotovism or even National Bolshevik strain of the Russian Communist Party, in a way mirroring the highly heterodox manner in which the main tenets of his thought are outlined. According to Molotov, V.I. Lenin was the first National Bolshevik, for his glorious Revolutionary cause was directed against foreign exploiters; the imperialist nobles who treated the worker and peasant classes as lower beings while flaunting their knowledge of French, German, English and other foreign customs. In Molotov’s eyes, the true Communist cause was one of the National Liberation of Russia - its genuine populace wholly included no matter what the supposed 'nationality' of theirs was - while upholding the truth that Lenin fought for his Socialist Fatherland. Molotovites believe that the nefarious White Guardist forces, who once plunged Russia into two decades of corruption under the failed Republic, represented the anti-human trinity of liberalism, bourgeois democracy and capitalism. Only through the blows of the hammer and strikes of the sword, through enthusiastic campaigns emulating the highly productive shock workers, and through industrialization & urbanization shall this unholy trinity be shattered, and Russia finally guided out of the dark ages the aristocratic strata kept it in, for if Molotov is allowed to act, he shall do so, establishing a glorious state of Socialism in One Nation based on values of social and national justice for all the oppressed within."

Combining the esoteric spiritual beliefs of the Mau-Mau group that raises Obama as the physical manifestation of their patron deity the ‘Ghost Goat’ with occultist practices, witchcraft, shamanism, Socialist Pan-Africanism, and Pan-African Nationalism, this syncretic ideology is unique in its outlook on the traditional Pan-African cause. Calling for cooperation and unity between all peoples of African under a totalitarian but benevolent Socialist hereditary theocracy under the prophet Obama that is backed by a strong volunteer and fanatically devoted military and supported by an economy vaguely resembling autarkic Agrarian National Syndicalism mixed with traditional tribalist practices, Obamaism is a ideology that could only be forged in the melting pot of chaos and extremism that is colonial Africa."
jacobinism_subtype:0 "Red Jacobinism"
jacobinism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Red Jacobinism)§!\n\nThe so-called 'Red Jacobins' represent the larger of the two factions composing the French Communist Party, commonly known as the Jacobin faction within the Commune. Led by the 'Son of the People' who worked his way up as an example to others from the lowest strata of society, Maurice Thorez, the mainstream of the French Communists upholds the orthodoxy as outlined by Marx and expanded upon by V.I. Lenin. Yet much to the surprise of some people who still remember Lenin calling Robespierre a 'Bolshevik avant la lettre', the 'Reds' enhance their Communist doctrine with the legacy of the Cordeliers, Enragés, Hébertists and Sans-Culottes. In such groups of the Great Revolution they find the beginnings of true Socialist thought, focusing on the urban proletariat and the poor workers, distrustful of the corrupting power of the political office and rabid anti-clericalism, going as far as drowning the clergy in rivers to liberate the mass from the opiate and grant them the Cult of Reason. Thorez also draws much from the proto-Communist 'Conspiracy of the Equals' led by François-Noël Babeuf whose legacy was carried to the First Paris Commune by the Neo-Babouvists. Thus, with the uniquely French Revolutionary legacy in one hand and the pure science of Marx and Lenin in the other, the Red PCF aims to establish a true Dictatorship of the Proletariat based on the principles of Democratic Centralism, ardent in class warfare, dogmatic in total unity and submission of the entire Left to the party, and ready to transform the French worker into a New Socialist Man prepared to carry the torch of the Revolution so brutally dimmed by the reactionary enemy."

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."

Created by the likes of Chief Thomas ‘New Moon’ Dixon, Dixonism seeks to fuse the tribalist, nationalist, militarist, corporatist, anti-clericalist, and highly xenophobic ideas of Towner’s platform with the Leftist economics and radical populisms of the Charter Totalists and their various subfactions, like Mosley’s Maximists or Mussolini’s National Syndicalists, seemingly at odds with the anti-Europeanism so inherent to Townerism’s core, yet Dixon cares not for minor indiscrepancies so long as the Red Race is set free to reclaim Turtle Island - the widely-shared indigenous name for the New World - once more.

A mix of Authoritarianism and pure Socialist Democracy, Popular Communism seeks to safeguard the Revolution without resorting to infighting, excess violence, brutal repressions and reprisals, and other inhumane practices.

Directed by their 'born dictator', a Maximalist synthesis of Blanquism and Pyotr Tkachev's theories, the Toilers shall develop a consciousness, the secret 'knowledge', necessary for the establishment of the Republic of the Third Russia, a spin introduced by Savinkov himself based on the writings of his friend Dmitry Merezhkovsky. The final turn to the Left has replaced NRPR's previously championed Apocalyptic Christianity with the Utopia of the Socialist Eschaton, the ultimate paradise brought to Earth by the destruction and transcendence of the material dialectic. Happy is he who believes in Socialism, in the coming paradise on Earth."

While the Crusader White Shirts, an organization he created in the wake of the economic crisis rocking the United States, was heavily inspired by both the proto-Charterite Totalists, Bolsheviks, Technocrats, the Klan and even Fordists, their main source of inspiration lies in the works of the "Three Southern Sociologists". The first and most important of them is George Fitzhugh, author of the notion that the entire state should be organized around slavery extended to the entire population, even the Whites, combined with a strict caste system and utter rejection of the 'infidel doctrines of natural liberty' advocated by the 'sages of 1776'. While originally considering himself an opponent of capital and in support of a welfare state, he later turned towards the exaltation of paternalistic monopoly capitalism. The second of them is Henry Hughes, creator of the 'warraneetism' concept in which the employer class would enslave the labourers under the watchful eye of the state. In exchange for the work, the 'warrantors' would provide the working class with not only all amenities, but even transportation, healthcare, and new opportunities. The last one of them, James Dunwoody Brownson De Bow, was the least 'leftist' of his compatriots and advocated for a strong system of independent Southern commerce and agriculture overseen by a technocratic-scientific management. While the ideas brought back to the surface by Christians are on the very fringe of the American society, perhaps one day the 'Second Southern Revolution' shall sweep away the notion of the shared 'Constitution' and values of people that yet oppose the drive to fix the world which is 'too little governed'."

And from this ideological malaise, what would become Hardliner Bolshevism began to take form. Primarily used by critics of the tendency, Hardliner Bolshevism is used to describe those who adhered to the same conclusion: That the failure of the Bolshevik Revolution was caused not by any innate flaws with the ideology, but rather a failure in defending the socialist state and entrenching ideological conviction within the people and the Communist Party. Primarily espoused by Nikolay Krestinsky, Victor Wilcox, and many more, those who are identified with the tendency argue for vastly authoritarian measures to defend the revolution beyond conventional Leninist principles, such as national militarization, state terror, a command economy and civil social-patriotism tied to the state instead of the nation. However, perhaps most notable is a vehement opposition to perceived 'revisionism' against Marx and Lenin, seeing all other dissenting socialists as merely 'pretenders' and 'bourgeois agents' seeking to upturn the teachings of Marx and Lenin. These efforts, they claim, are to ensure the continued survival of the revolution. Ironically, this has made some to call their commitment to socialism into question, labelling them as 'Bonapartists', 'red totalitarians', and many more.

Supporting the idea of ‘From each according to his ability, to each according to his need’, Anarcho-Communism calls for distribution and redistribution of society’s resources, the eradication of state tyranny, the creation of a stateless Socialist society supported by communalism, and the abolishment of private property so that it may be replaced with personal property and collective-ownership, along with many other traditional Communist positions that differ greatly with the specific group. However, Anarcho-Communists are as varied as they are dedicated to their united cause, split between a variety of sects and off-shoots like the endlessly bickering Organizationalist and Insurrectionary cliques that battle for dominance as the Insurrectionists draw from egoism and radical individualism while the Organizationalists stay rooted in more traditional Leftist influences of societal cooperation and mass cohesion. Beneath the broad umbrellas of these two titanic groups stand the Platformist Anarchists seeking to cooperate with all the various competing Anarchist schools of thought regardless of differences, the Synthesis Anarchists seeking to unite and syncretize the various breeds of Anarchism into one cohesive thoughtform, and the smaller groups like the agrarian Magonistas, educated Kropotkinites, violent Makhnovists, insurrectionist Galleanisti, and many more, all vying for their own interpretation of society, but all still united in the Anarchist position that stateless revolution is needed in order to eventual breed true Communism and a Socialist utopia."

Practiced by pirate groups from the Great Lakes of America’s Rust Belt to the stormy seas of Southeast Asia, this strange and syncretic ideology seemingly inspired by old tales of the egalitarian pirate paradise Libertalia calls for the creation of a radical Leftist society free from state tyranny and oppressive theory, and supported socio-economically and culturally by piracy and other criminal acts, and in some cases also by dockworkers’ or fishermen organizations and other nautical unions of the local maritime industry. The varied movement is tied to ideas like Caponeism, Illegalism, Individualist Anarchism, Mobster Populism, Communalism, Syndicalism, nautical Unionism, and other fringe forms of Leftist or semi-Leftist ideology that rage against traditional statist and societal structures, and stands to uphold piracy and its many criminal facets and lifestyles as both the lifeblood of the economy and of their ‘theory’, which is largely spread through the propaganda of the deed and criminal action over any literature or organized doctrine.

Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as both a way of life and a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob - who resist collectivism while holding that their crimes are an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement in line with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no such moral basis. Additionally, the Expropriative Anarchists of Spain and Argentina, such as Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso, Severino Di Giovanni, and Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, hold similar views as both Illegalist cliques, but only see criminality as a means to a political end, not a way of life worth living past the Revolution’s success. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies by using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a Anarchist utopia."

This ideology combines the essence of Cossack identity and heritage with the principles of socialism, creating a distinct socialist system of governance. Drawing inspiration from national-oriented communist movements such as National-Communism, the Red Cossack Dictatorship emphasizes the importance of recognizing and preserving national and cultural peculiarities within the framework of Marxist and communist principles. It rejects cosmopolitanism and globalization, advocating instead for the preservation and autonomy of a Cossack culture. While the Red Cossack Dictatorship shares some similarities with military dictatorships, it maintains a distinctive leftist orientation and a focus on achieving socialist objectives. It may exhibit less authoritarianism and militarism compared to other socialist regimes. Some variations of this ideology may strive to establish socialism and maintain power until their vision of a just society is achieved, while others may allow for elections once reactionary forces are subdued.

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that both unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth, and protects the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things that is supported by traditional family values, feminism, education reform, and chastity while rejecting forms of spiritual elitism and societal laziness such as monasticism, medicantism, and asceticism, for self-exertion and service to humanity is paramount. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Initially organized by the sister writing duo Paulette and Jeanne Nardal of Martinique, and later expanded with the help of Martinican poète Aimé Césaire, the Senegalese thinkers Abdoulaye Sadji and Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Léon Damas of French Guiana along with others like Gilbert Gratiant, Leonard Sainville, Louis T. Achille, Aristide Maugée, Négritude at its core is a collaborative thoughtform that disavows colonialism, racism, imperialism, inequality, and Eurocentrism while promoting independent and revitalized African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties in order to remove any stigma against African civilization while uplifting the African diaspora to an equal position of comradery and cooperation with the rest of the world; all atop a base of Marxist political philosophy in the Black radical tradition - however non-Marxist forms of Socialism like Social Democratism, Syndicalism, National Syndicalism, and other more extremist Leftist offshoots have become more common as the ideologies of the Third Internationale and further Socialists abroad continue to mutate and influence the African continent, especially as the Afro-Surrealist artistic foundations of the Négritude movement fuse with European concepts of the surreal and the futuristic. Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique. Refuting the idea of African cultural assimilation or notions of Africa being any less civilized than the rest of the world, the Négritude movement seeks to put Francophonic Africa on the path to shining glory, sitting at the global table as united, or at least cooperating, equals with the rest of the world while making the concept of being Black, or Négre, something to only be proud of."

Taking from both Anarcho-Syndicalist and more traditional Marxist-Leninist currents - particularly from the idealist, antipositivist, anti-evolutionist, and anti-materialist works of Italian thinkers like Antonio Gramsci and his theory of cultural hegemony, as well as from Benedetto Croce and Antonio Labriola, while also holding some similarities to Mexico’s own Far-Left pro-indigenists the Mexicayotl - Mariáteguismo offers a syncretic path forward for Peru’s indigenous souls while also caring for the larger Hispanicized population in a liberated system purged of imperialist corruption, anti-native sentiment, and the toxic Hispanicism that has led South America to ruin since the arrival of the Spanish. Mariáteguismo also curiously holds links to Peru’s avant-garde, with early Mariáteguist works being penned alongside Mariátegui’s own close friend, the famed Peruvian writer and narrator Pedro Abraham Valdelomar Pinto, which has also led to some more foreign ideas of the avant-garde scene flowing in from Paris and Italy. Citing the idea that Peru under the Inca and the other pre-Columbian tribes was a communalist, even proto-socialist network of societies built around collectivism and mass obedience to a shared social duty, Mariáteguismo believes that ‘The Conquest’ or the invasion of the Conquistadors triggered a split not only in our history, but our economics as well with the invading Europeans forcing us into a feudalist system that has only eroded Peru’s native culture and identity in the centuries since. Rejecting the corrupted law of Gamonalism, or ‘Bossism’, innate to the post-colonial bureaucracies of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, while refuting any deals and treaties they forced on past native groups, Mariáteguism seeks to undo the damage these many centuries of pro-European elitism, corruption, and capitalism has wrought on the Andes by tearing down the old order, divorcing the central government from the clutches of the gamonal, nationalizing the various resources and industries founded by natives that were later stolen and expanded by these gamonalists once and for all, and in general creating a revolutionary new Socialist state based along Marxist and Syndicalist syncretic lines, all in tune with the pro-indigenism and autonomous communalism of Mariáteguis himself."

Anti-democratic and abstentionist to the core, seeing the incorporation of Social Democratic and Right Opposition movements as a capitulation to capitalism and counterrevolutionary currents, Bordigists refute any participation in elections, and instead support the Leninist idea of a dictatorship of the proletariat (despite also heavily criticizing Lenin himself) along with organic centralism while rejecting the totalitarian nature seen in some surviving post-Bolshevik movements, positioning themselves as the true Left Communist scions of modern Marxism while holding the view that most Socialist governments of the post-Great War era have only been extending the liberal and bourgeois nature of prior revolutions that have since degenerated, as all had in common a policy of expropriation, along with agrarian and productive development, which Bordiga considered negations of previous conditions as opposed to the genuine construction of true Socialism from a unique and revolutionary source. Refusing to split the idea of Communism and Socialism as many Leninists do, Bordigists instead views Socialism as an unmatured and undeveloped form of Communism born from a Capitalist nation that must slowly mature into a Communist state, likening his definition of Socialism to Marx’s concept of lower-phase Communism that needs shepherding by vanguardist force on the road to true Communism. Against notions of personality cults or united fronts that only compromise the Communist message, Bordigists still hold some loyalty to the idea of Socialist Internationalism, and though no Bordigist would openly call themselves a Trotskyist, their movements do hold some tangential links and similar beliefs. Sometimes called Italian ‘Ultra-Leftism’ as a way to refer to their anti-Bolshevik, anti-Syndicalist, anti-Anarchist, and anti-Social Democratic ways along with their hatred for electoralism, technocratism, unionism, councilism, opportunism, liberalism, and reformism - instead banking on the natural and sudden spark of organic revolution as triggered by the proletarian masses with help from the vanguard - Bordgisits refuse compromise, cooperation, and the concept of slowly acclimating the proletariat and wider society to their radical ways in order to force the mass good of their ‘unique’ Communist theory onto Italian society as rapidly as possible."

The thoughtform was first officialized and outlined in Marinetti's Manifesto del Futurismo with help from other artists who worked alongside Marinetti in the original futurist group formerly centered in Milan, like Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. The movement at its core is an artistically-driven rejection of the past that seeks to unshackle the nation from any former identity in order to actualize the realization of a perfected future form, with Italian Futurism specifically glorifying modernity and the possibility and motion of an unknown and aesthetically-evolved future over any common sources of Italian traditionalism like the Renaissance or the Romans, with the goal to liberate Italy from the weight of its past entirely so as to fly into the boundless possibly of tomorrow. Despite being one of the most famous interventionist proponents alongside Benitto Mussolini, with whose National Revolutionary Bloc Marinetti has aligned after the establishment of the Socialist Republic, the unique 'Futurist Political Party' has outlined its own truly revolutionary programme separate from the likes of Charterist National-Syndicalism. In their political manifesto 'Democrazia Futurista', followers of the great artist have called for violent and precise anti-clericalism, abolition of the military in favour of light volunteer force, destruction of marriage in favour of nationalized upbringing of children and tax on free love, mass de-bureaucratization, full equality between the genders, Georgist inspired land reform, and a system of proportional reprensenation leading to the election of a technical one chamber government constituted by twenty members under 30 years of age representing all important social strata fairly. With all of their proposals, the Left Futurists aim to tear down the current order full of criminals and reactionaries both on the Right and on the Left, and where socialists and anarchists have always refused to wage war, in order to bring about 'the only hygiene of the world' as the Futurists have termed it. Although their nature is highly egalitarian and opposed to totalitarian modes of state, in recent years - owing to the shape Italy has found itself in - a radical wing centered around long-time Futurist Giuseppe Bottai has begun to grow, borrowing much from the National-Syndicalists and aligning with foreign supremacist movements."

Publishing his new theses in the newspaper 'La Verita', modeled after the former Bolshevik newspaper 'Pravda', the failure of the Leninist Revolution and the triumphant proclamation of the Socialist Republic in Torino have deeply influenced Bombacci, leaving both the corpse of the PSI and the divided PCd'I in favour of exclaiming the virtue of what he saw as the true movement of workers, a movement to which the most militant from his environment gravitated, a movement led by a man he shares a lot of history with from their younger days. Massimalismo has borrowed much from Mussolinism, merging the doctrines of National Syndicalism with Marxism and writing of V.I Lenin, yet replacing aspects of both. Where the Totalists shun the Vanguard Party, Bombacci sees the revitalized state of the nation hopefully ushered in by the Charter as the only way for a successful Vanguard to be formed after the events of the Russian Civil War. Where the Marxists call for seizing the means of production, National Maximalists yearn for the 'socialization of the economy', a concept developed by Edmondo Cione. The movement led by Bombacci has been notably compared to the National Jacobin faction inside the Commune, especially by a fellow Communist now sympathizing with Totalism Henri Guilbeaux, who sees the fastest growing radical leftist ideology as the only way to usher in a true International Revolution, one that Trotsky failed to achieve. Yet true heirs to Marx, to Lenin the martyr of Socialism, people like Benito Mussolini can rouse the masses and achieve true Communism.

To many Nkrumaism is the first native African attempt to formulate a Marxist analysis of the conditions and solutions for the Black Continent's anti-imperialist struggle, but painting the work of Gold Coast's, as the colonials refer to it, great statesman would be a disservice to the deep richness which permeates the ideological foundation upon which his Convention People's Party aims to govern. Consciencism is, above all, a great display of syncretism, combining the Euro-Christian, Islamic and original African influences with the works of Karl Max, V.I. Lenin and many Black American and Caribbean thinkers the likes of George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, C.L.R. James, W.E.B. Du Bois and Father Divine just to name a few.

Merging the patriotic and equalist zeal of the 'Archangel of Terror' and the putschist elite methods of establishing Socialism as according to Blanquism, the National PCF envisions that the will of the Revolutionary active shall become paramount to law. Galvanizing the heroic youth of the Jeunes Communistes to follow the example set out by the ceaseless revolutionary fervour and devotion of the Montagnard fathers, not even 30 years old when their flame was extinguished, the National Jacobins strive for nothing short of a total destruction of their enemies and military grandeur to achieve true Republicanism. Through the replacement of atheism with Cult of the Supreme Being, be it loosely defined, state collectivism with equal ownership of property under state capitalism, and outreach to oft forgotten by Leftists rural sector the Doriotist wing hopes to one day establish a renewed nation.

To remedy this the future government must, according to NSP's leader writings created together with the economist Nikolay Kondratiev, implement the 'New Economic Policy' leading to a gradual transition towards Socialism. This would be achieved through state regulation of a mixed economy using planned and market mechanisms, or 'Socialism in the City - Capitalism in the Village' as it was described during the party's foundational congress. While Bukharinism claims to represent 'True Leninism', it fluctuates between support for the Popular Front and its rejection in favor of the 'Party of the New Type', which has also led its proponents to differ on their stance towards trade unions, either championing their expansion or demanding their subservient transformation into production union."

Born into an aristocratic family, the young politician became disillusioned with the cause of the Conservatives after their violent reprisals against the civilians of Ireland. Together with his wife Lady Cynthia 'Cimmie' Curzon, the pair subscribed to the ideals of Fabian Socialism and joined the Labour Party independents. In any other world such a charismatic individual may have become the next Prime Minister, but the British Revolution and the collapse of the monarchy required a dramatic shift in Mosley's tactics. Having constituted the 'Maximist' group within the Trade Union Congress, the former Baronet published an ambitious document outlining the vision for a reborn Britain. The 'Mosley Memorandum' postulated that only through the creation of a protectionist, autarkic, National Syndicalist state, enhanced by the teachings of his friend John Maynard Keynes, could the vestiges of class conflict be put behind and a new healthy national corpus established. Despite working within the structures of the TUC for years, the ideas of the Memorandum were never adopted, and thus Mosley grew frustrated with what he called the 'Red Baronocracy' that supposedly never cared about the ordinary people of Britain. Seeing himself as the successor of Tudorian Kings that broke the power of the aristocrats, and also the Lord Protector Cromwell, whom Mosley calls the 'First British Totalist', the leader of the Maximists has made great strides to harness the power of the lower classes in his mission of reshaping the entire Union into a state organized around the Chairman. Although Mosleyites advocated for the liberation of the former British Empire and reunification with culturally close peoples, they still wish to pursue a Pan-European programme with brotherly nations. One of the closest comrades of Mosley is Benito Mussolini, with whom Oswald shares much yet they do differ on social outlook. On average, Mosleyism is rather progressive, supporting tolerance on religious grounds, a non-ethnic national-state identity, feminist initiatives, and even welcoming transgender members like Victor Barker. Ultimately, British Maximism is the personal vehicle of Oswald Mosley, whose vision shall light and carry a flame in Britain which the ages shall never extinguish, a flame which direction may prove to be unanticipated and sometimes, shocking."

A variant of Orthodox Syndicalism holding the same egalitarian, democratic, unionist, and labor-focused ideas as its predecessor, Afro-Syndicalism first developed in the old colonies of France and England across Africa and the Afro-Caribbean in the wake of the French and British Revolutions, differing in that it is more tailored to the realities of African living, whether it be on the home continent or somewhere in the New World, and not so concerned with European ideals. As such, it is usually more conservative and agriculturally focused while putting great emphasis on the need to capitalize on existing infrastructure left behind by colonialism so that it may be used as a foundation to reach even greater heights than the imperialist and capitalist past could ever aspire to, and is also usually friendly to the tradtional customs of Africa's many varied ethnic groups and their derivatives across the Diaspora. However, both pro-tribalist and anti-tribalist variants do exist, as well as more traditionalist and modernist forms as well. Additionally, there is much debate as to whether or not Afro-Syndicalists should support the Syndicalist Metropole in Europe that is the Third Internationale, with many unwilling to forgive the imperialist past that leading Syndicalist nations like France and England are rooted in. Instead, these eurosceptic Afro-Syndicalists favor ideas vaguely similar to those of Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev's National Communism or attitudes rooted in Pan-Africanism, and although Afro-Syndicalism is not Pan-African itself in nature, that has not stopped many Pan-Africans such as Kwame Nkrumah and George Padmore from adopting certain Afro-Syndicalist ideas, but it also has many more orthodox proponents like René-Paul Sousatte in Gabon, Cyrille Adoula in the Congo, David Hamilton Jackson of New York and the Virgin Islands, and many within the thriving trade unionist movements in places like Nigeria and Kenya, and as such, this infantile ideology has already begun to spread like wildfire across Africa and the lands of the wider African Diaspora."

Practiced by pirate groups from the Great Lakes of America’s Rust Belt to the stormy seas of Southeast Asia, this strange and syncretic ideology seemingly inspired by old tales of the egalitarian pirate paradise Libertalia calls for the creation of a radical Leftist society free from state tyranny and oppressive theory, and supported socio-economically and culturally by piracy and other criminal acts, and in some cases also by dockworkers’ or fishermen organizations and other nautical unions of the local maritime industry. The varied movement is tied to ideas like Caponeism, Illegalism, Individualist Anarchism, Mobster Populism, Communalism, Syndicalism, nautical Unionism, and other fringe forms of Leftist or semi-Leftist ideology that rage against traditional statist and societal structures, and stands to uphold piracy and its many criminal facets and lifestyles as both the lifeblood of the economy and of their ‘theory’, which is largely spread through the propaganda of the deed and criminal action over any literature or organized doctrine. Though rough, salty, sun-baked, and abrasive, these Pirate Populists seek to create their own sea-borne criminal utopia free from any naysayers and landlubbers who wish to anchor down their revolutionary dream."

Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as both a way of life and a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob - who resist collectivism while holding that their crimes are an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement in line with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no such moral basis. Additionally, the Expropriative Anarchists of Spain and Argentina, such as Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso, Severino Di Giovanni, and Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, hold similar views as both Illegalist cliques, but only see criminality as a means to a political end, not a way of life worth living past the Revolution’s success. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies by using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a Anarchist utopia."

Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that both unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth, and protects the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things that is supported by traditional family values, feminism, education reform, and chastity while rejecting forms of spiritual elitism and societal laziness such as monasticism, medicantism, and asceticism, for self-exertion and service to humanity is paramount. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Initially organized by the sister writing duo Paulette and Jeanne Nardal of Martinique, and later expanded with the help of Martinican poète Aimé Césaire, the Senegalese thinkers Abdoulaye Sadji and Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Léon Damas of French Guiana along with others like Gilbert Gratiant, Leonard Sainville, Louis T.

Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique.

Taking from both Anarcho-Syndicalist and more traditional Marxist-Leninist currents - particularly from the idealist, antipositivist, anti-evolutionist, and anti-materialist works of Italian thinkers like Antonio Gramsci and his theory of cultural hegemony, as well as from Benedetto Croce and Antonio Labriola, while also holding some similarities to Mexico’s own Far-Left pro-indigenists the Mexicayotl - Mariáteguismo offers a syncretic path forward for Peru’s indigenous souls while also caring for the larger Hispanicized population in a liberated system purged of imperialist corruption, anti-native sentiment, and the toxic Hispanicism that has led South America to ruin since the arrival of the Spanish. Mariáteguismo also curiously holds links to Peru’s avant-garde, with early Mariáteguist works being penned alongside Mariátegui’s own close friend, the famed Peruvian writer and narrator Pedro Abraham Valdelomar Pinto, which has also led to some more foreign ideas of the avant-garde scene flowing in from Paris and Italy. Citing the idea that Peru under the Inca and the other pre-Columbian tribes was a communalist, even proto-socialist network of societies built around collectivism and mass obedience to a shared social duty, Mariáteguismo believes that ‘The Conquest’ or the invasion of the Conquistadors triggered a split not only in our history, but our economics as well with the invading Europeans forcing us into a feudalist system that has only eroded Peru’s native culture and identity in the centuries since. Rejecting the corrupted law of Gamonalism, or ‘Bossism’, innate to the post-colonial bureaucracies of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, while refuting any deals and treaties they forced on past native groups, Mariáteguism seeks to undo the damage these many centuries of pro-European elitism, corruption, and capitalism has wrought on the Andes by tearing down the old order, divorcing the central government from the clutches of the gamonal, nationalizing the various resources and industries founded by natives that were later stolen and expanded by these gamonalists once and for all, and in general creating a revolutionary new Socialist state based along Marxist and Syndicalist syncretic lines, all in tune with the pro-indigenism and autonomous communalism of Mariáteguis himself."

Tracing its roots as far back as to the writings of the highly influential Revolutionary Syndicalist Georges Sorel, and then later developed by many Interventionist Socialist movements such as the Italian 'Leagues of Revolutionary Action', National Syndicalism aims to reform society to the extent which has never been attempted or done before by any regime, government nor even religion.

The in a way counter-Charterists have been called to action by what they see as a long developing betrayal of the Syndicalist and Socialist ideals, ultimately resulting in crazed Totalitarianism bent on destruction of everything that they oppose, the Reformists instead often seek to return to the principles outlined exactly in such documents as Carnaro's, guaranteeing a model of collective sovereignty for all citizens regardless of sex, race, language, class, or religion, with institutions infused by Anarcho-Syndicalism and lessons from the cards of Urban Medieval Italian and Athenian Democratic history.

To many Nkrumaism is the first native African attempt to formulate a Marxist analysis of the conditions and solutions for the Black Continent's anti-imperialist struggle, but painting the work of Gold Coast's, as the colonials refer to it, great statesman would be a disservice to the deep richness which permeates the ideological foundation upon which his Convention People's Party aims to govern.

Lenin and many Black American and Caribbean thinkers the likes of George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, C.L.R. James, W.E.B. Du Bois and Father Divine just to name a few. According to Nkrumah's closest associates, his philosophy is a Socialism of a non-atheist kind, meant to implement what all true religions teach yet not supplant them. That is freedom, unity, dignity and the right to self-determination of all peoples, all emboldened by Consciencism's view that pre-colonial Africa was a long of communalism and egalitarianism, values which can be brought back despite the damage the European institutions wrecked upon them. The critics of Ghana's rising star argue that Nkrumaism is nothing more than a mere cult of personality, reliant on one-party democratic centralism and populist state ownership policies while dressing the purely Utopian nature of its socialism in the supposed trappings of 'Scientific' Marxian elements.

Pallais, as a dissident priest suspended by the conservative Church establishment over his social Catholic activism among the poor and destitute communities represents the continuation of the liberal tendencies of many early Modernist creators. The most profound recent influence on Modernismo Nicaragüense, however, is de la Selva's interweaving of soft Syndicalist views into the mostly literature based movement, influenced by both his contact with the American Federation of Labor's leader Samuel Gompers and Frida Kahlo's partner Diego Rivera, together with expressed support for many actions of the government established by the great revolutionary Augusto César Sandino.

The movement is championed by Fred Maynard and the Australian Aboriginal Progressive Association, emerging as an offshoot of Garveyism introduced to Australia by African, Caribbean, and Indian seamen. The Sydney-based Garveyite organization, the Coloured Progressive Association, was formed in 1903 by these men, who spread Garvey's ideas among Aboriginal waterfront workers, leading to the modification to address the specific struggles of Indigenous Australians. The AAPA stands as the nation's first united and politically organized Aboriginal activist group, with a primary goal of ensuring that Indigenous affairs are managed by a proud and united Indigenous people. They advocate for the replacement of despotic Aboriginal Protection Boards with a management board composed of educated Aboriginals, with a chairman who would represent their people to the government. Additionally, the AAPA fights for Aboriginal citizenship, representation in parliament, or at least an ambassadorship to advocate for their rights. Central to their mission is securing land for Aboriginal families, grounded in the belief that Aboriginal people, as the original owners, have an inherent right to the land. These ideas have evolved through the revolution, with the AAPA working closely to unite the Aboriginal struggle with that of workers. Fred Maynard's active participation in the syndicalist Waterside Workers Federation of Australia exemplifies this solidarity, merging principles of Garveyist self-sufficiency, self-defense, and self-respect with the class solidarity inspired by his waterfront struggle.

Hinging around the practice of Satyāgraha - meaning ‘holding firmly to the truth’ or the Truth Force, which is the particular form of nonviolent or civil resistance employed by the Indian independence movement and other similar forces, Gandhists and the Satyagrahi utilize peaceful means to resist the governments, regimes, and policies they deem tyrannical in order to indirectly achieve progressive reform and societal change without needless bloodshed, only lashing out in self-defense when absolutely necessary as a life-saving last resort - though this self-defense clause is highly controversial with many followers of Mohandas K. Gandhi rejecting it in favor of total non-violence or Ahimsa. Additionally, Gandhism teaches egalitarian religious unity, especially between Hindus and Muslims who long have ravaged the region with their violent rivalries (though the Mahātmā created these unifying ideas through a Hindu lens with Brahmacharya in mind while his friend Abdul Ghaffar Khan did so through a Muslim lens with the Pashtunwali in mind), while also fostering nonviolent passions of patriotism and varied breeds of nationalism, upholding inalienable human rights and freedoms, and advocating for asceticism, fasting, and vegetarianism or veganism. Economically, Gandhism espouses the need for simple living, self-sufficiency, and import substitution on an agrarian platform that would focus on meeting the material needs of its citizenry before focusing on wealth generation or industrialization, while also pulling from the utopian anarchism and pacifist progressivism of Socialist thinkers like Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. Though shunned as a term by its ‘creators’ and not a true ideology in the eyes of the Mahātmā or Sarhadi Gandhi, Gandhism is nonetheless a strong political, cultural, and spiritual influencer across Southern Asia and beyond as Gandhians across the globe stand up for peaceful progress without resorting to violence outside self-defense."

It began life when Ángel Pestaña, alongside 29 other anarchists of the CNT-FAI, published a so called Manifest of the Thirty, which harshly criticized the actions of the CNT-FAI and its radical leaders, such as Buanaventura Durruti. This manifesto would eventually lead to a splitting of the anarchist movement, and Ángel Pestaña’s wing first implemented ideas of possibilist libertarianism in action. Possibilist libertarianism aims to legitimize anarcho-syndicalist ideas in a non-revolutionary way, seeking to implement their policies through the framework of a liberal democracy, usually in a wide popular front with other socialist, syndicalist and social democratic parties. While the eventual aims of the possibilist libertarians remain largely the same as those of their more radical comrades, such as the abolishment or heavy decentralization of the Spanish state and abandoning capitalism in favour of syndicalist principles, worker’s co-operation and communal decision making, it is considerably more moderate in its actions and doesn’t see trade unions as the main nucleus of anarcho-syndicalist action. Due to Pestaña’s experiences during the Russian civil war, Possibilist libertarianism is highly anti-authoritarian, opposing both left and right-wing forms of totalitarianism vehemently. While the ideology is mostly limited to the Partido Sindicalista formed by Pestaña and his close ally Benito Pabón, it also had some sway within CNT-FAI through anarchist Horacio Martínez Prieto, and in some ways, among the ranks of Federación Sindicalista Libertaria."

Anarcho-Abertzalism denounces the nationalist ideas of Sabino Arana, one of the main ideologues of current Basque nationalism, which tied Basque nationalism heavily to race and contrasts Basque people as more pure and pious than their Castilian counterparts . Anarcho-Abertzalism instead focuses on the Basque language and wider culture as a unifying factor, and often supporters of the ideology align with other left-wing nationalists such as the Eusko Alderli Sozialista. Heavily militant and disconnected from rest of Iberian anarchism, the movement is denounced by more mainline anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists of CNT-FAI and the Commune of France for aligning so closely with statist parties and movements, but it has gained quite a bit of traction among the less ideologically dogmatic members of the Biscayan and Gipuzkoan anarchists, who often associate more with the Basque people and tradition than the wider ideas of anarchism."

This economic goal being achievable through organizations such as cooperatives or through the ownership of economic assets by the democratic state. Indeed, to be socialist, the state must be democratic, as Bertrand Russell describes the essence of Socialism as ‘by definition the demand for common ownership of land and capital. Common ownership may mean ownership by a democratic state, but it does not include ownership by any undemocratic state’. Emile Durkheim, who differentiates between authoritarian and democratic Socialism, characterizes Democratic Socialism as one that provides for constant dialogue between the state and economic groups, within the framework of a respected and clearly defined balance of power. As a general rule, Democratic Socialism seeks to combine a system of representative democracy with a truly socialist economy, distinguishing itself from the Communists, who want to make the Party the true holder of power instead of the state institutions, from the Syndicalists, who base their political system on the trade unions, and from the Social Democrats, who have abandoned the socialist objective in favor of the creation of a so-called ‘pink’ or ‘soft’ Capitalism. Some organizations, although similar in their political and economic demands, use the label of 'Moderate Socialist' instead of Democratic Socialist, although such a difference may seem minimal, these groups generally use less of the usual rhetoric and imagery of the workers' movement, such as the Red Flag or the International.

Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as both a way of life and a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob - who resist collectivism while holding that their crimes are an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement in line with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no such moral basis. Additionally, the Expropriative Anarchists of Spain and Argentina, such as Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso, Severino Di Giovanni, and Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, hold similar views as both Illegalist cliques, but only see criminality as a means to a political end, not a way of life worth living past the Revolution’s success. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies by using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a Anarchist utopia."

The origins of National Communism can be found among the various minority activists within the Bolshevik movement, such as Ukraine's Vasyl Shakhrai, Tatarstan's Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev and Crimea's Ismail Firdevs, who became disillusioned with the continuation of cultural chauvinism so ever-present during the oppressive imperial era. Another important voice in the melding of national interests with communism, unrelated to the groups which operated within the Russian Communist Party, is the Borotbist movement led by Alexander Shumsky. National Communists carry the torch of Marx while noting that his position of workers having 'no country' refers to the globalized bourgeoisie states, machines for exploitation against which the policy of full independence or wide national autonomy in cooperation with new Socialist cores ought to be employed. For true Socialism, touching upon every aspect of local tradition, cannot be achieved unless the 'colonized' groups break the chains of their metropolitan masters. While to many Communists every National Communist represents a certain 'national deviation', the tendency itself does not merge its goals with explicit nationalism represented by the usual meaning of such term. That is not to say certain groups do not increase their reliance on the 'national' part of their ideology.

Some variations of this ideology may strive to establish socialism and maintain power until their vision of a just society is achieved, while others may allow for elections once reactionary forces are subdued.

While 'Socialist Feminism' is the most popular name, many high-profile thinkers reject the 'Feminist' part, considering Feminism to be an ideology deeply rooted within a bourgoise world, useless in advancing the working women's cause. The most popular currents within the broader movement are Anarcha-Feminism, pioneered by Teresa Mañé, Emma Goldman, and Itō Noe; and Marxist Feminism, with its most popular advocates being Alexandra Kollontai, Clara Zetkin, and Mary Inman. Leftist Feminists often fight not only for the emancipation of their gender and equal rights, but often for the rights of all people in a hopefully fairer future society. While active in parties and groups ranging from Anarchism through Syndicalism to Marxism and even National Syndicalism, most congregate inside the biggest Socialist parties in a given nation. Despite these being predominantly run by men, they welcome the Feminists as just another part of their Revolution, although there have been cases of political bureaus striking against representatives of Socialist Feminism on account of supposed 'ideological deviation'."

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that both unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth, and protects the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things that is supported by traditional family values, feminism, education reform, and chastity while rejecting forms of spiritual elitism and societal laziness such as monasticism, medicantism, and asceticism, for self-exertion and service to humanity is paramount. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Initially organized by the sister writing duo Paulette and Jeanne Nardal of Martinique, and later expanded with the help of Martinican poète Aimé Césaire, the Senegalese thinkers Abdoulaye Sadji and Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Léon Damas of French Guiana along with others like Gilbert Gratiant, Leonard Sainville, Louis T. Achille, Aristide Maugée, Négritude at its core is a collaborative thoughtform that disavows colonialism, racism, imperialism, inequality, and Eurocentrism while promoting independent and revitalized African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties in order to remove any stigma against African civilization while uplifting the African diaspora to an equal position of comradery and cooperation with the rest of the world; all atop a base of Marxist political philosophy in the Black radical tradition - however non-Marxist forms of Socialism like Social Democratism, Syndicalism, National Syndicalism, and other more extremist Leftist offshoots have become more common as the ideologies of the Third Internationale and further Socialists abroad continue to mutate and influence the African continent, especially as the Afro-Surrealist artistic foundations of the Négritude movement fuse with European concepts of the surreal and the futuristic. Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique. Refuting the idea of African cultural assimilation or notions of Africa being any less civilized than the rest of the world, the Négritude movement seeks to put Francophonic Africa on the path to shining glory, sitting at the global table as united, or at least cooperating, equals with the rest of the world while making the concept of being Black, or Négre, something to only be proud of."

Taking from both Anarcho-Syndicalist and more traditional Marxist-Leninist currents - particularly from the idealist, antipositivist, anti-evolutionist, and anti-materialist works of Italian thinkers like Antonio Gramsci and his theory of cultural hegemony, as well as from Benedetto Croce and Antonio Labriola, while also holding some similarities to Mexico’s own Far-Left pro-indigenists the Mexicayotl - Mariáteguismo offers a syncretic path forward for Peru’s indigenous souls while also caring for the larger Hispanicized population in a liberated system purged of imperialist corruption, anti-native sentiment, and the toxic Hispanicism that has led South America to ruin since the arrival of the Spanish. Mariáteguismo also curiously holds links to Peru’s avant-garde, with early Mariáteguist works being penned alongside Mariátegui’s own close friend, the famed Peruvian writer and narrator Pedro Abraham Valdelomar Pinto, which has also led to some more foreign ideas of the avant-garde scene flowing in from Paris and Italy. Citing the idea that Peru under the Inca and the other pre-Columbian tribes was a communalist, even proto-socialist network of societies built around collectivism and mass obedience to a shared social duty, Mariáteguismo believes that ‘The Conquest’ or the invasion of the Conquistadors triggered a split not only in our history, but our economics as well with the invading Europeans forcing us into a feudalist system that has only eroded Peru’s native culture and identity in the centuries since. Rejecting the corrupted law of Gamonalism, or ‘Bossism’, innate to the post-colonial bureaucracies of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, while refuting any deals and treaties they forced on past native groups, Mariáteguism seeks to undo the damage these many centuries of pro-European elitism, corruption, and capitalism has wrought on the Andes by tearing down the old order, divorcing the central government from the clutches of the gamonal, nationalizing the various resources and industries founded by natives that were later stolen and expanded by these gamonalists once and for all, and in general creating a revolutionary new Socialist state based along Marxist and Syndicalist syncretic lines, all in tune with the pro-indigenism and autonomous communalism of Mariáteguis himself."

This synthesis uplifts currents of classical and radical liberalism along with their idea that Liberalism innately is the sole political theory that truly takes the inner freedom of the human spirit into account as a given while adopting liberty as the goal, means, and rule of shared human life, thus putting the rights and needs of every individual citizen above all else instead of relying on some detached, state-driven goal or a ‘for the greater good’ mentality common in more traditional Marxist circles. Instead of compromising this idea of perfected liberty with socialist concepts, Liberal Socialism dictates that Socialism is not the end all be all, but more so is seen as the tool or method necessary to realize this recognition of liberty through political and economic autonomy and society-wide emancipation from the grip of pressing material necessity. Refusing to abolish capitalism with a socialist economy, instead supporting a mixed economy and broad economic syncretism that includes both social ownership and private property in capital goods, Liberal Socialism walks a middle path between revolution and reform, liberalism and socialism, in order to create a true society of liberty for all."

Grounded in the belief that there is only one source of authority that any and all Christians are ultimately answerable to - being God himself and his wider teachings embodied in Jesus Christ - this specific breed of Leftism believes that it is only moral, pious, and just to reject all other forms of earthly authority such as the State, seeing these sources of human-based authority to be innately violent, deceitful, unjust, and idolatrous. Furthermore, Christian Anarchism holds that the concept of a ‘Kingdom of God’ - or more broadly the creation of a pious stateless society bound by humanistic and egalitarian Christian social teachings - is the only proper expression of the relationship between God and humanity, characterizing human relationships under such a ‘Kingdom’ by horizontal organization, servant leadership, and universal compassion, and not through the traditional, and often oppressive, structures of organized religion, which most Christian anarchists consider hierarchical and or otherwise authoritarian in nature. Additionally, most Christian Anarchists are also pacifists who reject war, militarism, and the use of violence even if revolutionary in nature, though their economic ideas and proclivity to industrial urbanism and Syndicalisms or agrarian ruralism and Anarchist Democracy can vary, though most Christian Anarchist movements pull heavily from the Leo Tolstoy’s ‘The Kingdom of God is Within You’ as well as the Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount of the Bible. Overall, Christian Anarchists believe in one God and one master in Heaven while rejecting all other forms of authority, hierarchy, inequality, and statism borne from earthly or human sources in order to build an egalitarian and free communalist society under God. Among the most popular existing movements espousing Christian Anarchism today are the Catholic Worker Movement organized by the American social activist Dorothy Day and Nomadelfia, a community situated within the territory of the Papal States established by father Zeno Saltini."

Putting forth that the only tax should be on land value, for taxing the economic rent only leads to inefficiencies and exploitation, Georgism is primarily concerned with economics, but has since been tied to ideas ranging from Syndicalism and Progressivism to Democratic Socialism and Left Libertarianism to certain strains of Anarchism and even non-Socialist ideologies in more Rightist and Centrist circles.

The thoughtform was first officialized and outlined in Marinetti's Manifesto del Futurismo with help from other artists who worked alongside Marinetti in the original futurist group formerly centered in Milan, like Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. The movement at its core is an artistically-driven rejection of the past that seeks to unshackle the nation from any former identity in order to actualize the realization of a perfected future form, with Italian Futurism specifically glorifying modernity and the possibility and motion of an unknown and aesthetically-evolved future over any common sources of Italian traditionalism like the Renaissance or the Romans, with the goal to liberate Italy from the weight of its past entirely so as to fly into the boundless possibly of tomorrow. Despite being one of the most famous interventionist proponents alongside Benitto Mussolini, with whose National Revolutionary Bloc Marinetti has aligned after the establishment of the Socialist Republic, the unique 'Futurist Political Party' has outlined its own truly revolutionary programme separate from the likes of Charterist National-Syndicalism. In their political manifesto 'Democrazia Futurista', followers of the great artist have called for violent and precise anti-clericalism, abolition of the military in favour of light volunteer force, destruction of marriage in favour of nationalized upbringing of children and tax on free love, mass de-bureaucratization, full equality between the genders, Georgist inspired land reform, and a system of proportional reprensenation leading to the election of a technical one chamber government constituted by twenty members under 30 years of age representing all important social strata fairly. With all of their proposals, the Left Futurists aim to tear down the current order full of criminals and reactionaries both on the Right and on the Left, and where socialists and anarchists have always refused to wage war, in order to bring about 'the only hygiene of the world' as the Futurists have termed it. Although their nature is highly egalitarian and opposed to totalitarian modes of state, in recent years - owing to the shape Italy has found itself in - a radical wing centered around long-time Futurist Giuseppe Bottai has begun to grow, borrowing much from the National-Syndicalists and aligning with foreign supremacist movements."

Sharing the argument that systems were made for men, and not the other way around, that its predecessor was formed around, Leftist Social Credit seeks to bend financial rules and mainstays along with the very notion of an ideological spectrum in order to ensure absolute socio-economic security for its populace, though the ideology is still split between more egalitarian and broad humanitarian cliques like those seen in the Ireland, or in places the United States with Robert Heinlein and New Zealand with John A.

In recent years 'Jermanism' began to coalesce into a semi-concrete form of ideology, due to the influence of neighbouring leftist groups like the ones in India or China, and thus began advocating for separation of religion and state while still respecting the right to worship, council communalism in a semi-anarchist organization of the state, full removal of the hierarchical backwardness steeped in Kazi dominated class system, ecological and agrarian socialism, incorporating existing tribal structures into the functions of a modernized state and most importantly creating a cohesive syncretic culture uniting all of the diverse groups that call Sikkim their home into one 'Sikkimese' identity.

Hinging around the practice of Satyāgraha - meaning ‘holding firmly to the truth’ or the Truth Force, which is the particular form of nonviolent or civil resistance employed by the Indian independence movement and other similar forces, Gandhists and the Satyagrahi utilize peaceful means to resist the governments, regimes, and policies they deem tyrannical in order to indirectly achieve progressive reform and societal change without needless bloodshed, only lashing out in self-defense when absolutely necessary as a life-saving last resort - though this self-defense clause is highly controversial with many followers of Mohandas K.

Additionally, Gandhism teaches egalitarian religious unity, especially between Hindus and Muslims who long have ravaged the region with their violent rivalries (though the Mahātmā created these unifying ideas through a Hindu lens with Brahmacharya in mind while his friend Abdul Ghaffar Khan did so through a Muslim lens with the Pashtunwali in mind), while also fostering nonviolent passions of patriotism and varied breeds of nationalism, upholding inalienable human rights and freedoms, and advocating for asceticism, fasting, and vegetarianism or veganism. Economically, Gandhism espouses the need for simple living, self-sufficiency, and import substitution on an agrarian platform that would focus on meeting the material needs of its citizenry before focusing on wealth generation or industrialization, while also pulling from the utopian anarchism and pacifist progressivism of Socialist thinkers like Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy.

While a member of the Russian Communist Party during the Civil War and one of the leaders of the Muslim Socialist Committee of Kazan, Soltanğäliev became concerned with the problem of the replacement of the exploiter imperial core, led by bourgeoisie, with the international proletariat which could devolve to the same role. According to him, only through a united dictatorship of the 'colonies and half-colonies' over the 'metropole' can the chains that bind the oppressed nations, such as the entire Muslim world, be finally broken. Despite combining that view with the position that dialectical materialism was developed not only in Europe, but also in the nations of the East, thus rejecting mindless copying of everything the Occidental Marxists transport onto his world, Mirsäyet is entirely willing to accept a unified front with the poor masses of all of Russia to bring true Socialism about. To that extent the creation of a Tatar-Bashkir Soviet Republic, or even pan-Turania governed by the rules of democratic centralism, is meant as either an autonomous ally of the Russian Socialist Republic, or even the final reserve of the Revolution guarding against the renewed bourgeoisie from the imperial core, trying to destroy the Tatar identity, as well as the reactionaries of China and India. Just like the Jadidists, to which his father belong, are concerned with the reform of their Islamic societies so does Soltanğäliev outline an extensive plan for progress within the Muslim world. To the Tatar revolutionary the term 'Muslim' refers to a shared cultural background, and not a religion meant to be preserved for he still adhered to the Marxist doctrine of atheism. Yet the method in which Islam ought to be fought has to be different from combating Christianity, for the youngest Abrahamic faith already upholds many aspects compatible with orthodox Communism while suffering from a high degree of clerical influence. Due to such mix of views Soltangalievism serves as a paramount example for both nascent Marxist colonial liberation movements so concerned with the fight against the metropolitan masters, especially inside the Muslim world, as well as the thinkers espousing National Communism."

First popularized in South Africa by Jan Smuts and certain Afrikaner labour groups, European Pan-Africanism as defined by Smuts initially called for the cooperation of colonial states across the Southern African colonies of Britain, Portugal, and Belgium in equal partnership with no official political alignment despite Smuts’ own Liberal Conservatism, but has since evolved, with certain strains calling for the total unification of these lands and possibly all of the wider continent under one Socialist - but still White chauvinistic - nation state that abandons the colonial mentality in order to rise to true statehood on equal footing with the titans of Europe while heavily encouraging White settlement en masse, as theorized by Jean and Albert Decoster in the Congo. An ideological personification of the White Man’s Burden and Cecil Rhodes’ efforts that varies between Leftist strains in the Congo and more conservative strains in South Africa, European Pan-Africanism is a strange ideology newly forged in the fires still left burning since the Scramble for Africa that above all seeks to bring law, order, and elevated social status to the colonials currently languishing away across the Dark Continent."

Biétry also developed this form of unionism ideologically, rejecting the revolutionary approach that the workers' enemies were the bosses, he demonstrated that the real enemies of the French workers were the Boche and the Jew, cultivating a strong nationalism within his organization, receiving monetary support from many industrialists before the Revolution of 1919, with the goal of countering the much larger Red Syndicalist movement.

Emerging from the disillusioned sections of their youth sections and the few supportive scholars and politicians of the movement and, this heterodox tendency advocated for a total break from the traditionally autocratic and ultraconservative roots of the ideology behind, viewing them as mere shackles that held the movement back from true monarchism. Taking influences from socialist movements around the world, particularly of communist and communist-adjacent workers’ self management models adopted by Bukharin, Josip Broz, Karl Renner, Otto Bauer and more, those who are identified by the label advocated for a pluralist socialist democracy, led by a reformed democratic Carlist organization, which would become a mass party fusing socialism and constitutional monarchism. In addition, they retained their former commitment to regional and local autonomy, but now through a lens of socialist federalism, Left Carlists have managed to raise popularity and begrudging respect from the many disparaging ethnic groups of Spain, even with the most stubborn of separatist regions of Catalonia, Basque Country, and more. However, despite their overt radical left-wing ideals, the Christian ideals and origins of the movement remained as a guiding principle of those who follow, or claimed to follow the ideology, as well as suspicions to outright disdain of modern liberal principles in favour of Catholic personalism and Christian democracy, even if under a Red lens. While the movement remained rather tiny and has struggled to attain legitimacy, due to suspicions of the tendency by most on all sides of the political spectrum, as well as various splits between more nationalist-leaning and more socialist-leaning factions, it continues to influence the minds of many within the Spanish nation, and, if given enough push from forces both inside and outside Spain, perhaps Carlism could be given a proper rejuvenation from its traditionalist stagnancy into a reformed, democratic and populist ideology fit for the Spanish masses."

Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."

These particular movements promote classical social-democratic theses, notably an assertive Reformism of the liberal capitalist system in order to soften it and make it compatible with the demands and rights of the workers, but are in one way or another aligned with Syndicalism. Whether from a purely foreign policy angle, that is to say a rapprochement of these social-democratic governments with the Third International at the expense of the other main geopolitical blocs such as the Reichpakt or the Entente. Or a more political rapprochement, where social democrats cooperate more extensively with labor unions and promote the role of unions in the economy or political governance, without challenging traditional political institutions or creating a purely Syndicalist system.

This economic goal being achievable through organizations such as cooperatives or through the ownership of economic assets by the democratic state. Indeed, to be socialist, the state must be democratic, as Bertrand Russell describes the essence of Socialism as ‘by definition the demand for common ownership of land and capital. Common ownership may mean ownership by a democratic state, but it does not include ownership by any undemocratic state’. Emile Durkheim, who differentiates between authoritarian and democratic Socialism, characterizes Democratic Socialism as one that provides for constant dialogue between the state and economic groups, within the framework of a respected and clearly defined balance of power. As a general rule, Democratic Socialism seeks to combine a system of representative democracy with a truly socialist economy, distinguishing itself from the Communists, who want to make the Party the true holder of power instead of the state institutions, from the Syndicalists, who base their political system on the trade unions, and from the Social Democrats, who have abandoned the socialist objective in favor of the creation of a so-called ‘pink’ or ‘soft’ Capitalism."

Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary. Ultimately, the political creation of Huey Long is a personalist vehicle not unlike those in Southern America, being everything to his die-hard supporters, while willing to borrow and utilize any idea that will ensure continued dominance of the AFP, Huey Long and ensure that every man can be king."

Staunchly egalitarian and socially progressive, Figuerismo advocates for the introduction of suffrage for everyone regardless of their gender, educational status, or race, free public education, and welfare reform. Despite calling for nationalization of the banks and dissolution of the armed forces in an effort to combat the rise of uniquely Central American caudillos, Ferrer's ideology is by no means entirely Red.

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity.

Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob - who resist collectivism while holding that their crimes are an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement in line with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no such moral basis. Additionally, the Expropriative Anarchists of Spain and Argentina, such as Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso, Severino Di Giovanni, and Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, hold similar views as both Illegalist cliques, but only see criminality as a means to a political end, not a way of life worth living past the Revolution’s success. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies by using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a Anarchist utopia."

Sharing the love of profit that all organized criminals share while embracing a softer approach in order to garner the participation and affection from the masses, this particular form of criminality was pioneered by ‘Liberal’ mobsters like Jimmy Hoffa and the infamous Papa Johnny Torrio, under the direction of Lucky Luciano, that utilizes Liberal, Progressive, and Populist measures wrapped in a semi-republican structure in order get the easily-swayed masses on their side while using organized crime to provide an equal and fair Liberal society where anyone and everyone has a fair shot at becoming a made-man or hitting the big time. Less paternalistic and concerned over tradition than normal criminal states and more in-tune with the people, at the cost of some profits and long-preserved traditions, these liberalized criminal pseudo-republics and faux-democracies tread the line between true criminal states and highly corrupt and kleptocratic societies of a more modern and common nature."

It is deeply rooted in the Kuban People's Republic and the Almighty Don Host, and revolves around the concept of power being concentrated in the hands of the Cossacks. In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society. This exclusivity solidifies the dominant position of the Cossacks within the political structure and ensures their continued influence. Unlike traditional democratic ideologies, Cossack Democracy does not aim for broad-based inclusivity. Instead, it emphasizes the preservation and promotion of Cossack interests within a democratic framework."

First appearing in Western Europe in conservative groups pushing for social reform in the areas of science, economics, education, technology, medicine, and other facets of human living conditions that had begun to be negatively affected by the Industrial Revolution and its growing consequences, as well as with the abolitionist movement that had begun to take flight around the time, particularly in Britain. Calling for social safety nets and minimalist welfare systems, Progressive Conservatism seeks to improve society without radical or rapid changes to the established status quo and traditions, and is often tied to Catholic social teaching, Christian democracy, and even the papal literary work ‘Rerum novarum’ which calls for a form of Catholic conservative progressivism in order to safeguard the Christian working masses against the predation of Socialism. In more modern times, the ideology has been practiced and adapted across the world by the likes of former American president Theodore Roosevelt and British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, and now has begun finding contemporary popularity once again as a Conservative alternative to more dangerous and radical Leftist progressivist ideology."

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered.

This synthesis uplifts currents of classical and radical liberalism along with their idea that Liberalism innately is the sole political theory that truly takes the inner freedom of the human spirit into account as a given while adopting liberty as the goal, means, and rule of shared human life, thus putting the rights and needs of every individual citizen above all else instead of relying on some detached, state-driven goal or a ‘for the greater good’ mentality common in more traditional Marxist circles. Instead of compromising this idea of perfected liberty with socialist concepts, Liberal Socialism dictates that Socialism is not the end all be all, but more so is seen as the tool or method necessary to realize this recognition of liberty through political and economic autonomy and society-wide emancipation from the grip of pressing material necessity. Refusing to abolish capitalism with a socialist economy, instead supporting a mixed economy and broad economic syncretism that includes both social ownership and private property in capital goods, Liberal Socialism walks a middle path between revolution and reform, liberalism and socialism, in order to create a true society of liberty for all."

In opposition to the monarchy-favouring liberals of Benedetto Croce and the dictatorial marxists of Antonio Gramsci, Concretismo combines secularist aspects from the Age of Enlightenment, liberalism and socialism. Salvemini has long rallied against the corrupt political machines specifically keeping the South poor in an effort to bind the local political class to their interests, and thus advocates for far-reaching economic and social reform to uplift the Mezzogiorno from destitution. Presenting his ideas as a third way between conservative-liberal order and the dictatorship of revolutionary socialism, Gaetano Salvemini sees the reconstruction of whole Italy as only possible through universal suffrage, humanitarian socialism, implementation of a democratic republic based on the ideals of social justice, national self-determination for Italians in occupied territories and democratic interventionism abroad, meant to awaken Italy's consciousness and make the people rediscover and reconsider their democratic roots. While Salvemini sees a future in a reunified Italy, as his life goes on Concretismo has begun developing a noticeable and harsh anti-Northernern slant, even with calls to permanently separate Sicily from the Peninsula and calling the House of Savoy 'pigs in tuxedos'."

Rising from humble origins, with no means of education in his childhood village of Namthang, he still became one of the leaders of the popular sentiment against the exploitation and torment of the common Lepcha people by the Kazi landlords. Later joining forces with many other reformers within the isolated kingdom, Jerman created the so-called Members Party, the first political group in the area that advocated for definite social progress and end of Kazis' elitist dominance while still maintaining that the rule of the traditional Namgyal monarchs could be preserved. In recent years 'Jermanism' began to coalesce into a semi-concrete form of ideology, due to the influence of neighbouring leftist groups like the ones in India or China, and thus began advocating for separation of religion and state while still respecting the right to worship, council communalism in a semi-anarchist organization of the state, full removal of the hierarchical backwardness steeped in Kazi dominated class system, ecological and agrarian socialism, incorporating existing tribal structures into the functions of a modernized state and most importantly creating a cohesive syncretic culture uniting all of the diverse groups that call Sikkim their home into one 'Sikkimese' identity.

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that both unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth, and protects the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things that is supported by traditional family values, feminism, education reform, and chastity while rejecting forms of spiritual elitism and societal laziness such as monasticism, medicantism, and asceticism, for self-exertion and service to humanity is paramount. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Hinging around the practice of Satyāgraha - meaning ‘holding firmly to the truth’ or the Truth Force, which is the particular form of nonviolent or civil resistance employed by the Indian independence movement and other similar forces, Gandhists and the Satyagrahi utilize peaceful means to resist the governments, regimes, and policies they deem tyrannical in order to indirectly achieve progressive reform and societal change without needless bloodshed, only lashing out in self-defense when absolutely necessary as a life-saving last resort - though this self-defense clause is highly controversial with many followers of Mohandas K. Gandhi rejecting it in favor of total non-violence or Ahimsa. Additionally, Gandhism teaches egalitarian religious unity, especially between Hindus and Muslims who long have ravaged the region with their violent rivalries (though the Mahātmā created these unifying ideas through a Hindu lens with Brahmacharya in mind while his friend Abdul Ghaffar Khan did so through a Muslim lens with the Pashtunwali in mind), while also fostering nonviolent passions of patriotism and varied breeds of nationalism, upholding inalienable human rights and freedoms, and advocating for asceticism, fasting, and vegetarianism or veganism. Economically, Gandhism espouses the need for simple living, self-sufficiency, and import substitution on an agrarian platform that would focus on meeting the material needs of its citizenry before focusing on wealth generation or industrialization, while also pulling from the utopian anarchism and pacifist progressivism of Socialist thinkers like Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. Though shunned as a term by its ‘creators’ and not a true ideology in the eyes of the Mahātmā or Sarhadi Gandhi, Gandhism is nonetheless a strong political, cultural, and spiritual influencer across Southern Asia and beyond as Gandhians across the globe stand up for peaceful progress without resorting to violence outside self-defense."

Popularized as a natural response to Russia’s increasingly imperialist policies, the Altaians sought to distinguish themselves from the surrounding tribes and to cement their own distinct ethnic identity in the face of possible cultural annihilation by embracing the new faith en masse. Originally millenarian, charismatic, and anti-shamanic all in an attempt to completely revolutionize Altaic culture and society so that it may survive the sweeping tide of modernity, Burkhanism has adapted to drop much of these aspects, becoming more routine and more rooted in Altai’s pre-existing folk religion and shamanistic bases, while also coalescing around an institutionalized hierarchy of oral epic singers that serves as the clergy and theocratic administrative and judicial body of the faith. Overall, Burkhanist religious ideas are a syncretistic mix of varied pre-shamanist, shamanist, Tibetan Buddhist, Tengrist, and Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs, though it is not viewed as being a sub-sect of any of these larger faiths, instead being its own distinct thing largely focused on Altaic national salvation, though some forms of the faith advocate broader ideas such as unity with the Tuvans or even all of Pan-Mongolia. Controversially, Ak Jang has also been hijacked and further developed by the Kalmyk-born Mongolian warlord Dambiijanstan, aka Ja Lama, who sees himself as the prophesied reincarnation of the messianic hero Amursana while preaching a far more violent and ethno-supremacist bastardization of Ak-Jang driven by savage banditry and geared towards the total destruction of the Chinese as revenge for their past crimes against the Oirat-Altaic people of old Dzungaria and beyond, but aside from this radical off-shoot not recognized by the main high choir, the White Faith is largely centered in Altai proper while promoting far more agreeable and peaceful ideas aimed at ensuring that Altaic culture and their very way of life endures."

Although starting out as highly Anti-Revisionist Marxists on the party's far-left wing, the three politicians became symbols of an heterodox strain of Internationalist Social Democracy sometimes called 'Germanic Socialism.' Such an outlook was shaped primarily by the War Socialism instituted during the Great War, transforming the bourgeois state into a centrally directed unit upheld by the cohesive support of worker-soldiers and trade unions. Another foundational text of the movement was Johann Plenge's book '1789 und 1914: Die symbolischen Jahre in der Geschichte des politischen Geistes', in which the 'Ideas of 1789' and thus Liberty were contrasted and had to be sundered by the 'Ideas of 1914' (Organization), represented by a newly reborn German spirit struggling to expunge the Anglo-French capitalist order. The deep influence of Plenge upon the Lenschian Tendency can be seen in its namesake's vision of the World War as an Internationalist Revolution, where the strong German Proletariat struck against the status quo affirming degenerated British labour movement founded upon the legacy of monopolistic parliamentarian monarchism and Calvinism. Only through the creation of a true 'Volksgemeinschaft', a people's community, can the German Empire which already made great strides in its recent democratization ensure that the the globe shall know the light of Socialism. To this extent Paul Lensch promotes the foreign policy ideals formulated by his two collaborators, Konrad Haenisch and Heinrich Cunow.

Serving as Premier of New South Wales for the state's Labor Party, Lang's ideology was forged through the state's struggles during the Depression, diverging from mainstream labor with his proto-Keynesian economics and populist approach. As premier, he expanded social welfare, workers' rights, and universal suffrage, with a central focus on dismantling the state's unelected legislative council, a goal that caused him to be ousted from his first premiership. After regaining his position, in opposition to the adopted Lyons plan, the Lang Plan was proposed, opposing austerity, pushing for the adoption of a goods standard, the temporary cessation of war debts along with an injection into the economy to stimulate the nation's economy. This uncompromising political stance was supported by the so-called "Lang Gang," a network of allies strategically positioned within the Labor Party machinery, anti-arbitrationist unions, labor newspapers, and even the police force. This consolidated power was further bolstered by a populist movement with broad and active support from impoverished Australians who benefited from Lang's policies. While once being thrown out of office by the state's governor, Langism is now triumphant at the federal level and will prove once and for all \"Lang is Right!\""

For the Federalists, the different ethnic groups and cultures making up China can only prosper by governing themselves, through regional assemblies made up of civilians elected by universal suffrage. The Federalists reject the concept of political tutelage of Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang, as they believe the people are already able to identify what is beneficial or not for them, and to form their own opinions. Federalist intellectuals also call for far-reaching agrarian reforms, including farmer subsidies and the promotion of peasant unions, while the position to adopt towards large landowners is still a matter of debate. Federalists' social positions are generally progressive, calling for a thorough overhaul of China's archaic legal codes and the development of a bureaucracy and a new class of administrators to replace the corrupt warlords. Their masters of thought are many, but the main one today is the general and revolutionary Chen Jiongming, who draws his inspiration mainly from the United States, wishing to organize 'the United States of China in the manner of the American experience'. Although criticized by some, such as Sun Yat-sen himself, who believed that federalist ideology would prevent China from defending itself against external threats and would legitimize the power of vicious regional governors, Federalism is making a comeback as the centralist Qing Empire is slowly losing its grip on China."

Supporters of agrarian parties range from large landowners or landed gentry to smallholders and poor farmers, from the lower high class through the most consistent support base among the middle class, and ending up on the lower classes. The origins of political agrarianism can be traced to the 'government of nature' developed by physiocrat and laissez-faire advocate François Quesnay, as well as the republic of rural virtue of Thomas Jefferson. While supporters of such parties hold the people of the land as a foundation of society and the most important part of the nation's organism, they differ wildly in their positions regarding economy, taxation, protectionism vs free trade, system of government, religion etc. Agrarian parties are generally conservative and traditionalist, although there is a sizeable contingent of radically liberal and downright socialistic groups, with some unconventional right-wingers mixed in-between. This wide range can be seen by looking at only a few rural movements, such as the German national revolutionary Landvolkbewegung or the conservative and monarchist Bund der Landwirte, the more centrist Czech RSZML or the Finnish Maalaisliitto, and even the radicals in terms of social changes such as Poland's PSL Wyzwolenia or Bulgaria's BZNS."

Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary.

Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity.

Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

regionalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Post-Colonial Regionalism)§!\n\nPost-Colonial Regionalism, often called African Regionalism, is split along varied political currents including Capitalist Liberalism and Conservatism to anti-Capitalist Socialism, Corporatist juntas, and Tribalist unions, and describes a political system that seeks to increase political power, influence, and self-determination of the people in one or more subnational regions in a specific nation in post-colonial Africa. Common in new nations like Togo, Congo, and Nigeria that have long been racked by regional rivalries divided along ethnic and cultural lines forced to now live in an amalgamated nation, African Regionalism focuses on the development of a political or social system based on one or more ‘regions’ within a state, and/or on the national, normative, or economic interests of said specific region or other subnational entity. Similar to ideas of Nationalism but antithetical to their idea of total cohesion and equality across all territory, African Regionalism commonly fixates or prioritizes certain regions, ethnicities, cultural groups, religious sects, or peoples on a specific and personal basis unique to each nation and their reality, and is frequently seen in states and other recently-coalesced nations with a long history of factionalism, territorial rivalries, and ethno-cultural conflict, such as in Africa hence the name, but is also common in other regions such as across East Asia and the New World. Commonly favoring confederations and federalism over the idea of unitary systems and strong centralized governments, Regionalists look to places like the early United States, the Ottoman Empire, or modernized clannist structures as influences as they create a web of autonomous and semi-autonomous administrations within their national patchwork to create a modern nation state that fits the needs, traditions, histories, and unique differences of each constituent entity within the regionalist framework and their favored administrative entities or populations."

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Less paternalistic and concerned over tradition than normal criminal states and more in-tune with the people, at the cost of some profits and long-preserved traditions, these liberalized criminal pseudo-republics and faux-democracies tread the line between true criminal states and highly corrupt and kleptocratic societies of a more modern and common nature."

It is deeply rooted in the Kuban People's Republic and the Almighty Don Host, and revolves around the concept of power being concentrated in the hands of the Cossacks. In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society. This exclusivity solidifies the dominant position of the Cossacks within the political structure and ensures their continued influence. Unlike traditional democratic ideologies, Cossack Democracy does not aim for broad-based inclusivity.

Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered.

However, Mazzini himself and his ideology still support the Christian faith and wider spirituality, just believing it has no place within the functions of state, while also actively fighting against ideas of both Church elitism and radical atheism, as well as against the rampant selfish individualism commonly seen in other liberal republics that the ideology partially takes inspiration from, like the United States. For Mazzinists, a true republic is a place where freedom and justice can be achieved for all people - even non-Italians living in Italy and abroad based on Mazzini’s principle of a brotherhood or association of all mankind, and this ideal is pursued by walking a middle line of liberal compromise while maintaining a firm stance against both syndicalist and reactionary extremism. Violently opposed to the Totalists of Mussolini’s BNR as well as the Legionarists of Corradini’s ANI, seeing these movements as perversions of D’Annunzio’s true message of class collaborationist communalism and direct democracy in line with the Carta del Carnaro of D’Annunzio and Alceste de Ambris, Mazzinianesimo and its adherents, like Randolfo Picciardi and his faction within the Partito Repubblicano Italiano or Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi II and his brothers Sante and Ricciotti Jr. and the rest of the liberal veteran officers within the Associazione Nazionale Combattenti, are united in bringing true liberty, freedom, and justice for all Italians, and they are willing to fight and even die for their righteous republican cause."

This synthesis uplifts currents of classical and radical liberalism along with their idea that Liberalism innately is the sole political theory that truly takes the inner freedom of the human spirit into account as a given while adopting liberty as the goal, means, and rule of shared human life, thus putting the rights and needs of every individual citizen above all else instead of relying on some detached, state-driven goal or a ‘for the greater good’ mentality common in more traditional Marxist circles. Instead of compromising this idea of perfected liberty with socialist concepts, Liberal Socialism dictates that Socialism is not the end all be all, but more so is seen as the tool or method necessary to realize this recognition of liberty through political and economic autonomy and society-wide emancipation from the grip of pressing material necessity. Refusing to abolish capitalism with a socialist economy, instead supporting a mixed economy and broad economic syncretism that includes both social ownership and private property in capital goods, Liberal Socialism walks a middle path between revolution and reform, liberalism and socialism, in order to create a true society of liberty for all."

Popularized as a natural response to Russia’s increasingly imperialist policies, the Altaians sought to distinguish themselves from the surrounding tribes and to cement their own distinct ethnic identity in the face of possible cultural annihilation by embracing the new faith en masse. Originally millenarian, charismatic, and anti-shamanic all in an attempt to completely revolutionize Altaic culture and society so that it may survive the sweeping tide of modernity, Burkhanism has adapted to drop much of these aspects, becoming more routine and more rooted in Altai’s pre-existing folk religion and shamanistic bases, while also coalescing around an institutionalized hierarchy of oral epic singers that serves as the clergy and theocratic administrative and judicial body of the faith. Overall, Burkhanist religious ideas are a syncretistic mix of varied pre-shamanist, shamanist, Tibetan Buddhist, Tengrist, and Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs, though it is not viewed as being a sub-sect of any of these larger faiths, instead being its own distinct thing largely focused on Altaic national salvation, though some forms of the faith advocate broader ideas such as unity with the Tuvans or even all of Pan-Mongolia. Controversially, Ak Jang has also been hijacked and further developed by the Kalmyk-born Mongolian warlord Dambiijanstan, aka Ja Lama, who sees himself as the prophesied reincarnation of the messianic hero Amursana while preaching a far more violent and ethno-supremacist bastardization of Ak-Jang driven by savage banditry and geared towards the total destruction of the Chinese as revenge for their past crimes against the Oirat-Altaic people of old Dzungaria and beyond, but aside from this radical off-shoot not recognized by the main high choir, the White Faith is largely centered in Altai proper while promoting far more agreeable and peaceful ideas aimed at ensuring that Altaic culture and their very way of life endures."

As a creation of the son of an old Hanseatic patrician family, the philosophical nature of the so-called 'Cultural Mannism' is steeped within the bourgeois outlook common in Germany. For Mann, there exists a clear distinction between 'culture', the sublimation of the demonic as represented by Germany, and the reason, enlightenment, moderation, moral education, skepticism of the Anglo-French 'civilization.' Thus the writer came to oppose the democratization mad 'Zivilisationsliteraten', Civilisation's Literary Men inherent in the Romanistic radicalism lending itself to progressivism going too far, pushed by political artists inherently alien to the German inner soul. The followers of Mann hold the faith in God as expressed by love, life and art as the highest values, ones which Germany had to defend in the necessary war of liberation against both Anglo-French 'civilization' and the strict police state of the world that was the Tsarist Russian regime. Despite views which many would describe as highly individualistic, anti-democratic and grasping at the 'aestheticism as freedom from politics' the experience of the War and later cooperating with Walther Rathenau changed Mann, pushing him towards seeing Germany as the shatterer of inert balance of power. A shift that resulted in the most recent variant of Cultural Mannism advocating for preservation of the slow 'parliamentarization' of the Kaiserreich and increasing its role as a guarantor of peaceful coexistence with moderate nations united in a specific kind of Pan-European cooperation."

Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century.

Emerging from a literary club in Adelaide, South Australia, its ideals began in an address entitled "On Environmental Values" by its founder, Rex Ingamells. Breaking from the radical Australasia First Movement, the Jindyworobak Movement seeks to cultivate a distinct Australian identity and free Australia from "whatever alien influences trammel it" while allowing the revolutionary state's political machinations to continue unimpeded. The term "Jindyworobak," derived from an Indigenous Australian word meaning "to annex" or "join," reflects the movement's aim to blend Indigenous Australian elements with settler culture, fostering a unique national consciousness. Rooted in a deep connection to the Australian landscape, reacting to the urbanization of modern times, and an appreciation for a "sense of place," Jindyworobak supporters' only vague economic foundation stands in the aesthetic of the authentic Australian bush and preserving its majesty and agrarian way of life. However, the movement is not without its internal divisions.

The Jindyworobak Movement, therefore, encompasses a broad spectrum of beliefs and forms the most moderate movement after the revolution, allowing a fusion of liberal economics and unionist collaboration while focusing on cultural redefinition.

The movement is championed by Fred Maynard and the Australian Aboriginal Progressive Association, emerging as an offshoot of Garveyism introduced to Australia by African, Caribbean, and Indian seamen. The Sydney-based Garveyite organization, the Coloured Progressive Association, was formed in 1903 by these men, who spread Garvey's ideas among Aboriginal waterfront workers, leading to the modification to address the specific struggles of Indigenous Australians. The AAPA stands as the nation's first united and politically organized Aboriginal activist group, with a primary goal of ensuring that Indigenous affairs are managed by a proud and united Indigenous people. They advocate for the replacement of despotic Aboriginal Protection Boards with a management board composed of educated Aboriginals, with a chairman who would represent their people to the government. Additionally, the AAPA fights for Aboriginal citizenship, representation in parliament, or at least an ambassadorship to advocate for their rights. Central to their mission is securing land for Aboriginal families, grounded in the belief that Aboriginal people, as the original owners, have an inherent right to the land. These ideas have evolved through the revolution, with the AAPA working closely to unite the Aboriginal struggle with that of workers. Fred Maynard's active participation in the syndicalist Waterside Workers Federation of Australia exemplifies this solidarity, merging principles of Garveyist self-sufficiency, self-defense, and self-respect with the class solidarity inspired by his waterfront struggle. In their mission, the proponents of Aboriginal Garveyism aim for the spiritual, political, industrial, and social upliftment of Aboriginal people, steadfastly striving to empower their communities to determine and shape their destinies."

soclib_chinese_federalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Chinese Federalism)§!\n\nThe cause of Chinese Federalism is a diverse movement, mostly born in the 1920s, claiming that the best way to administer the large and diverse territory that is China is by adopting a decentralist, republican and democratic model of governance. For the Federalists, the different ethnic groups and cultures making up China can only prosper by governing themselves, through regional assemblies made up of civilians elected by universal suffrage. The Federalists reject the concept of political tutelage of Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang, as they believe the people are already able to identify what is beneficial or not for them, and to form their own opinions. Federalist intellectuals also call for far-reaching agrarian reforms, including farmer subsidies and the promotion of peasant unions, while the position to adopt towards large landowners is still a matter of debate. Federalists' social positions are generally progressive, calling for a thorough overhaul of China's archaic legal codes and the development of a bureaucracy and a new class of administrators to replace the corrupt warlords. Their masters of thought are many, but the main one today is the general and revolutionary Chen Jiongming, who draws his inspiration mainly from the United States, wishing to organize 'the United States of China in the manner of the American experience'. Although criticized by some, such as Sun Yat-sen himself, who believed that federalist ideology would prevent China from defending itself against external threats and would legitimize the power of vicious regional governors, Federalism is making a comeback as the centralist Qing Empire is slowly losing its grip on China."

managerial_technicracy_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Managerial Technicracy)§!\n\nManagerial Technicracy - nascent and nurtured by German engineer Walther Rathenau - defines a society that has been perfectly retooled as a mechanical organism with Spirit. Named for its empowerment of trained managers as the guides of society, the Technicratic Government seeks to liberate the toiling "manual" workers from their days of drudgery through an ambitious societal reconstruction. As Rathenau has found, the assembly line has destroyed the individual's love of life, yet a return to handicrafts and agrarian utopias would neglect the destiny-defining production that industrial power provides. The solution then is to simply erase the barriers between the "manual" worker and his brother, the "intellectual" worker. These class divisions are to be cast off, replaced instead with "cultures" that their members freely associate with and where hereditary membership plays no part, and all easily joined and left as the individual understands their role in society. However, there is also an obliged transfer of people between the new cultures via the "Interchange of Labour". In this the manual worker will find solace in mental stimulation and gain an empathy for intellectual pursuits, perhaps even helping him realize that his choice is to labor within manufacturing rather than resign himself to that fate. Alongside the laborers, the “brainworkers” of the nation will then realize the trials their countrymen deal with, and they will become truly involved with society rather than remaining shut away with their pursuits. All this in tandem with a drastic increase in general well-being by utilizing the profits made from the manager's unobstructed direction of the economy. In this managerial mechanism, the pipedream of socialist equality is finally done away with, as instead now every man and woman understands their place in society and is gleefully willing to apply themselves. The parasites who feed off of society and give nothing in return, the loafers, idlers and slackers, will have their own place: expunged from the New Society."

Blasquismo is, at its roots, a populist ideology with a Spanish republican lean, with its core tenets being those of relentless grassroots activism, protection of Valencian culture and occasionally, violence against political opponents. Blasquist activism was organized primarily in various casinos located in the city of Valencia and in the newspaper articles written by Blasco Ibáñez. This led to the movement’s demonstrations being more sporadic and improvised than those of their fellow liberal republicans, but also netted them a far larger working class support than was typical to Spanish centrist parties. Like the more mainline radicals of Spain, Blasquismo is fervently anti-clerical and also historically fought with the Catalans over their attempts to expand political actions into Valencia. Blasquist movement underwent a period of civil war as Blasco Ibáñez and his party rival Rodrigo Soriano clashed over leadership, leading to bloody clashes between their supporters. This exemplifies best the difference between Blasquismo and other Spanish centrist Republicans, the grassroots nature and closeness to Valencian people has in the past cause the movement to inspire great fanaticism and party tribalism in its supporters. As can be expected, Blasquismo is heavily tied to the ideology of Alejandro Lerroux’s Radicals, as the main Blasquist party, Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista, was a close ally of Partido Radical. However, this alliance has undergone several periods of falling out and reunification, where the entire Blasquist ideology has shifted more towards conservatism or back towards more traditional radicalism depending on their relationship with the larger party."

While Lerroux’s and his party’s, Partido Radical Republicano’s, political positions have shifted dramatically during the era of the Second Spanish Republic and the military regime that followed it, Lerrouxismo at its core remains largely the same. Made up of fiery anti-clerical rhetoric, staunch resistance to Catalan separatism and heavy-handed tactics against its many enemies, Lerroux and his followers are willing to use violence, bribery and criminal means to achieve their aims. During the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Lerrouxists were also involved in assassination attempts aimed at the king Alfonso XIII, sometimes even uncharacteristically in alliance with the anarchists of Catalonia. Contrary to the typical centrist party support base made up of middle class and intelligentsia, Lerrouxismo relies very heavily on workers, especially from Catalonian industrial areas, where Lerroux has utilized immigrant resentment towards native Catalans to drum up support for his radicals.\n\n These supporters, which Lerroux tended to call “young barbarians”, were encouraged to use radical means in order to tear down the control of the church and conservative institutions present in Spain at the time. The populist means used by Lerrouxists are also enhanced in part by the control the party holds over worker entertainment centres, such as the street of Paralelo in Barcelona. This has in the past allowed Lerrouxists to remain close to the grassroots militants of the party, as well as organized crime involved in gambling. Lerroux’s demagoguery and ideological flexibility has allowed this ideology to thrive despite the various twists and turns the Spanish politics have taken, but it may not always lead to the best results given the scandalous reputation the party has forged for itself."

Supporters of agrarian parties range from large landowners or landed gentry to smallholders and poor farmers, from the lower high class through the most consistent support base among the middle class, and ending up on the lower classes. The origins of political agrarianism can be traced to the 'government of nature' developed by physiocrat and laissez-faire advocate François Quesnay, as well as the republic of rural virtue of Thomas Jefferson. While supporters of such parties hold the people of the land as a foundation of society and the most important part of the nation's organism, they differ wildly in their positions regarding economy, taxation, protectionism vs free trade, system of government, religion etc. Agrarian parties are generally conservative and traditionalist, although there is a sizeable contingent of radically liberal and downright socialistic groups, with some unconventional right-wingers mixed in-between. This wide range can be seen by looking at only a few rural movements, such as the German national revolutionary Landvolkbewegung or the conservative and monarchist Bund der Landwirte, the more centrist Czech RSZML or the Finnish Maalaisliitto, and even the radicals in terms of social changes such as Poland's PSL Wyzwolenia or Bulgaria's BZNS."

Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity.

Opposed to artificial American aristocracy, Federalist centralization, and corruption, Jeffersonians value secular virtue based on Enlightenment ideas that prioritize the yeomen farmers, planters, plain folk, and other common men of America while pursuing Anti-Clericalism, Arcadian Agrarianism, and the expansion of American Nationalism and the American sphere of influence through imperialist means and the pursual of Manifest Destiny, all guided by a strong and dominant executive."

First theorized by German socialist theorist Ferdinand Lassale with his idea of the Nachtwächterstaat - a system inspired by the watchman system of public-organized militias separate from the government that protected towns and cities starting in Europe’s medieval period - Minarchism treads the line between State and Statelessness, arguing that Anarcho-Capitalism and other forms of total Anarchism are impractical as they cannot enforce the non-aggression principle, while total State control strips liberty and freedom from all beneath its gaze. As such, Minarchists tread this tightrope carefully as they use the night-watchman system to provide the masses a form of court system, military, and police force not originating from the State, but from the free masses themselves, creating a society free from tyranny that maintains the NAP and protects the public from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, enforcing property laws, and other encroachments on their inalienable freedoms, liberties, and rights."

Policy-wise Toryism is characterized as highly socially-conservative, deeply Anglican, anti-liberal and very often pro-monarchist. In terms of the economy, it often fluctuates between supporting a free-market or protectionism, with many internal schisms fought over that issue.

A considerable influence on various thinkers across the entire ideological line from Antonio Gramsci to Giovanni Gentile, Croce has been the head of the Italian Liberal Party after Giovanni Giolitti, the controversial former prime minister died. Liberalism of the Spirit agrees that the individual is the basis of society, but rejects the idea of social atomism, seeing the individual as something more than just a collection of self-interests. For Croce liberalism does not have to necessarily involve fixed legitimate powers, nor Capitalism, for if another system, even Socialism which contribution to the Italian independence struggle Croce highly admires, would still advance liberty it has a legitimate place in society. This has lead Benedetto to separate liberalism from laissez-faire attitude to economics which he dubbed as liberism. For Aesthetic Liberals, following the thinker's Aesthetic Expressivism idea art representing emotions, there is no Lockean natural right to liberty, for it is granted by the continued vigilance against oppressive barbarism, led not by the absurd egalitarian notion but by true liberal aristocrats, the few which can create the goodness of truth, civilization, and beauty.

Literally meaning 'Whoeverism', the term has been adopted by the movement in a sort of mockery against the supposedly 'politically aware' classes that decry this populist anti-establishment stance, best characterized by one of their slogans Abbasso tutti! or 'Down with everyone!'. Giannini sees the State as inherently untrustworthy, having grown tired of its intrusion into people's private lives, and thus advocates for a purely 'technical' government with a single one year term politician that'd work like a dutiful accountant, administrating the minimized state and leaving after his job was done. The day-to-day running of the nation would be left to local committees with clerks directly responsible before the voters. Vowing to fight against both collectivist socialists and the big business capitalists, Qualunquismo advocates outline a reform plan for the nation that would include limits on taxation, removal of the government from social life and enshrinement of individual's economic liberty. Because of these positions, the movement has been compared and sometimes even equated to multiple right libertarian tendencies and ideologies. Surprising many observers, Giannini's Common Man's Front contains certain monarchist tendencies, seemingly seeing a monarch that governs but not rules as acceptable if the choice had to be made between the crown or the disdained ethical imperialists of mass parties.

While describing himself as a nominally left-wing liberal, Weber's desires and writings have found fertile ground across the political aisle and, despite his nationalist leanings, influenced many thinkers such as Talcott Parsons, Carl Schmitt, György Lukács, and Raymond Aron. Regardless, Weberian Liberalism can be defined by radical individualism, liberal nationalism, a sympathy for republicanism and Protestantism, and general belief in capitalism. Weber's deep affinity for the individual, however, has led to his thought system taking on a deeply anti-bureaucratic stance, especially in regards to the specialized efficiency brought about by modern capitalism. In Weber's view, the end result of the prevalent economic system of the present era is the creation of a rationalized 'iron cage' that would destroy a person's ability to create their own choices, the antithesis of the innovative spirit that capitalism should be encouraging. To bite back against this pessimistic view of modernity without venturing into reactionary rhetoric or gutting the efficiency granted by bureaucracy, Weber's platform includes a 'leadership democracy'. This system would involve a wide-reaching electoral process, emphasizing grassroots populism, to find a charismatic demagoguge with an unflinching conviction and the responsibility to use their power well. Such a leader is hoped to wield the opposites of rationalization: creativity, fervor, and personal will. To combat the possible autocracy this could craft, Weber proposes an involved citizenry that participates as much as possible in politics. Through this combination of a powerful executive and an educated, powerful citizenry, Weber hopes that the 'polar night of icy darkness' will not come to pass. Ultimately, the Weberian Liberals' primary enemy is the dystopic vision of a world controlled by a cruelly mechanized bureaucracy that must eternally seek more productivity. Thus, their raison d'etre is the avoidance of this fate by enlightening the innovative spirit of the individual."

Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century. However, these old, dusty relics from times medieval and ancient are not the only examples, other more contemporary kritarchies have survived outside Europe, being seen in the traditional Xeer legal system of clannist Somalia, or in the eyes of some modern scholars, being apparent within the government of the United States of America thanks to the landmark SCOTUS case Marbury v. Madison in 1803, which in the eyes of many scholars knocked the Supreme Court of the United States off the rails of checks and balances and down the slippery slope towards judicial rule. Even seen as a form of proto Anti-Statism by some fringe Libertarian and Anarchist scholars, Kritarchies are wildly varied and hotly debated, for many academics debate and doubt the veracity of many of these examples as true kritarchies, but regardless, they can be united along with other forms of government like them in their general adherence to judicial law and legalist governance."

For him, liberalism is above all an individual and philosophical concept, rather than an economic one, making public and communal associations the principal means of expressing freedom, while being convinced of the ineffectiveness of traditional political parties and admiring the form of 'organic and natural freedom' represented by the anti-parliamentary leagues, which brought him closer to monarchist and nationalist circles, as well as a member of the Radical Party's so-called 'Young Turks' movement.

Guizot made class struggle one of his main principles, recognizing that society functions on a hierarchical economic order of conflicting interests, just as Marx theorized. However, Guizot drew a different conclusion: the working class should not crush the bourgeoisie, but work with all their might to achieve a level of material possession similar to that of the bourgeoisie, becoming themselves members of that class, thus creating a cycle of work and physical and psychological effort leading to innovation and societal advancement on a national level, class struggle is therefore beneficial to all. For Guizot, the aim of the state is not to artificially elevate people's social status, or to put an end to class warfare, but to ensure that every man has the means to take his destiny into his own hands and rise socially, hence the meritocratic aspect. Guizot, inspired by the philosophers of the Enlightenment, starts from the premise that every individual is born with the same natural freedoms, abilities and rights as his or her fellow human beings. Guizot therefore emphasized the development of education as the main goal in giving everyone a chance and the tools they need to succeed in their own right.

Blasquismo is, at its roots, a populist ideology with a Spanish republican lean, with its core tenets being those of relentless grassroots activism, protection of Valencian culture and occasionally, violence against political opponents. Blasquist activism was organized primarily in various casinos located in the city of Valencia and in the newspaper articles written by Blasco Ibáñez. This led to the movement’s demonstrations being more sporadic and improvised than those of their fellow liberal republicans, but also netted them a far larger working class support than was typical to Spanish centrist parties. Like the more mainline radicals of Spain, Blasquismo is fervently anti-clerical and also historically fought with the Catalans over their attempts to expand political actions into Valencia. Blasquist movement underwent a period of civil war as Blasco Ibáñez and his party rival Rodrigo Soriano clashed over leadership, leading to bloody clashes between their supporters. This exemplifies best the difference between Blasquismo and other Spanish centrist Republicans, the grassroots nature and closeness to Valencian people has in the past cause the movement to inspire great fanaticism and party tribalism in its supporters. As can be expected, Blasquismo is heavily tied to the ideology of Alejandro Lerroux’s Radicals, as the main Blasquist party, Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista, was a close ally of Partido Radical.

Made up of fiery anti-clerical rhetoric, staunch resistance to Catalan separatism and heavy-handed tactics against its many enemies, Lerroux and his followers are willing to use violence, bribery and criminal means to achieve their aims. During the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Lerrouxists were also involved in assassination attempts aimed at the king Alfonso XIII, sometimes even uncharacteristically in alliance with the anarchists of Catalonia. Contrary to the typical centrist party support base made up of middle class and intelligentsia, Lerrouxismo relies very heavily on workers, especially from Catalonian industrial areas, where Lerroux has utilized immigrant resentment towards native Catalans to drum up support for his radicals.\n\n These supporters, which Lerroux tended to call “young barbarians”, were encouraged to use radical means in order to tear down the control of the church and conservative institutions present in Spain at the time. The populist means used by Lerrouxists are also enhanced in part by the control the party holds over worker entertainment centres, such as the street of Paralelo in Barcelona. This has in the past allowed Lerrouxists to remain close to the grassroots militants of the party, as well as organized crime involved in gambling. Lerroux’s demagoguery and ideological flexibility has allowed this ideology to thrive despite the various twists and turns the Spanish politics have taken, but it may not always lead to the best results given the scandalous reputation the party has forged for itself."

To call the Kingfish's programme wide would be an understatement, for his ideological musings combine elements from all sides of the spectrum while tying them together with the aura of populism serving the common folk. Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary. Ultimately, the political creation of Huey Long is a personalist vehicle not unlike those in Southern America, being everything to his die-hard supporters, while willing to borrow and utilize any idea that will ensure continued dominance of the AFP, Huey Long and ensure that every man can be king."

Furthermore, Oligarchism can be remarkably different in how it determines who shall wield the power, with some oligarchies having a racial basis for their hierarchy. Oligarchs themselves typically come from backgrounds of immense wealth, causing them to be derided as only caring about their own power over the well-being of the nation itself as they continue to safeguard their capital and remain corrupted with nepotism.

Policy-wise Toryism is characterized as highly socially-conservative, deeply Anglican, anti-liberal and very often pro-monarchist. In terms of the economy, it often fluctuates between supporting a free-market or protectionism, with many internal schisms fought over that issue.

Neo-Confucianism is an attempt at creating a more rationalist and secular form of Confucianism, being highly critical of East Asian faiths such as Taoism and Buddhism, and especially opposed to the newer faiths of the encroaching West. Seeing metaphysics, or philosophies dealing with the fundamental nature of reality, as a catalyst for spiritual development, religious enlightenment, and even immortality, Neo-Confucianists use this philosophy as a guide for creating an ethical and rational ideology based on modernized traditionalism, familial values and Confucianist socio-economic ideas such as gaining wealth over the generations in a ‘posterity through offspring’ system as opposed to the instant gratification of Western Liberal Capitalism, the pursuit of social harmony, humanism, and secular rationalism supported by non-intrusive spiritualisms and religions, among other more varied and less-widely agreed up ideas on politics and socio-economics such as cultural exceptionalism, civic or ethnic nationalism, class cooperation, and mercantilist, corporatist, communalist, humanist, or even neo-feudalist financial systems.

Common in new nations like Togo, Congo, and Nigeria that have long been racked by regional rivalries divided along ethnic and cultural lines forced to now live in an amalgamated nation, African Regionalism focuses on the development of a political or social system based on one or more ‘regions’ within a state, and/or on the national, normative, or economic interests of said specific region or other subnational entity. Similar to ideas of Nationalism but antithetical to their idea of total cohesion and equality across all territory, African Regionalism commonly fixates or prioritizes certain regions, ethnicities, cultural groups, religious sects, or peoples on a specific and personal basis unique to each nation and their reality, and is frequently seen in states and other recently-coalesced nations with a long history of factionalism, territorial rivalries, and ethno-cultural conflict, such as in Africa hence the name, but is also common in other regions such as across East Asia and the New World. Commonly favoring confederations and federalism over the idea of unitary systems and strong centralized governments, Regionalists look to places like the early United States, the Ottoman Empire, or modernized clannist structures as influences as they create a web of autonomous and semi-autonomous administrations within their national patchwork to create a modern nation state that fits the needs, traditions, histories, and unique differences of each constituent entity within the regionalist framework and their favored administrative entities or populations."

In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society. This exclusivity solidifies the dominant position of the Cossacks within the political structure and ensures their continued influence.

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations.

The Action Française thus rejects the French Revolution and its consequences in order to establish a decentralized, traditional, localist and federal monarchy, with political powers concentrated in provincial assemblies with the King as the great national arbiter, while promoting Catholicism as the cement of national unity. On the intellectual level, Maurras emphasizes reason and Classicism and opposes Romanticism."

Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered. Regardless, the Pan-Scandinavian dream must be achieved, and through equal cooperation and shared destiny, the dream of a peaceful and prosperous Scandinavia bound by our shared Nordic Spirit will be earned as the Three Sisters gradually grow closer and closer together."

However, the most controversial aspects of Pelley's ideology concern his policies regarding certain minorities, such as Appalachian Whites, Deep Southern Blacks and Mexican immigrants, that have been deemed as 'unproductive'. They would become wards of the state and inducted into the 'ward system', deprived of any benefits the citizens have then relegated to labor jobs until they can be properly educated for entry into the Commonwealth.

Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them. The most famous proponent of what came to be popularly known as 'esoteric nationalism' is Julius Evola, the Italian thinker who merged concepts of racial aristocratic elite, masculine heroism with pre-existing Western and Eastern spiritual traditions, chief among them Buddhism and Hinduism."

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper. Seeking to attain the near-godhood of the Masters while living their best lives in search of wisdom and enlightenment, Theosophists and their varied philosophy may have little in common across the different political and socioeconomic systems that push their truth, but all true Theosophists can still find light under the Absolute."

At its core, Qadimism places a strong emphasis on the preservation and revitalization of traditional Muslim communal institutions. These include mosques, madrasas, and local communities (mahalla), which are perceived as the bedrock of internal cohesion within the Muslim society. Central to Qadimist ideology is a deep commitment to the Sharia, the Islamic legal system. Qadimists viewed the Sharia as not only a legal framework but also as a means of safeguarding the specific interests of the Muslim community within the Russian Empire. This involved a resistance to the encroachment of secular influences on educational and judicial institutions, which Qadimists believe would compromise the collective identity and cohesion of the Muslim community.\n\nQadimism stands in ideological opposition to reformist movements, such as the Jadidism, which advocate for modernization and adaptation to changing circumstances. The conflict between Qadimists and reformists revolves around differing interpretations of the roles and goals of social and cultural institutions. Qadimists argue for the administration and redistribution of wealth by communal institutions like mosques, emphasizing the communal welfare over individual accumulation of wealth. The movement also critiques the emergence of a new intellectual class, often educated in European or Ottoman universities, that promotes secularization. Qadimists express skepticism toward these intellectuals, perceiving them as a threat to the traditional social order maintained by religious leaders (Mullahs) and existing community structures. In defending traditional Islamic education, Qadimists resist the introduction of reformed \"Jadid\" schools, championing the preservation of the established way of teaching in maktab and madrasa settings.

Sinarquismo is divided between two main factions, the revolutionary nationalists and national syndicalists of Urquiza, and the orthodox millenarians and assorted advocates of ‘Catholic Social Order’ headed by Abascal, while a small subfaction pushes in a more ‘moderate’ and semi-democratic direction by advocating either a union with the National Action Party or a transition of the National Synarchist Union into an official party of its own in order to garner wider public support, but both are moves detested by most true Synarchists due to their deep-seated hatred for democracy. Synarchists all agree that Leftism, Liberalism, and Atheism are the three worst things to haunt the modern world despite the other minor differences that divide them, and as such all factions seek to return to a more traditional and ultra-conservative platform under a supreme executive so that Mexico can be cleansed of sin, while also incorporating other varied ideas such as national conservatism, anti-populist class collaboration, Catholic theocratism, integral nationalism, Rightist communalism, and corporatist statism. Additionally, Synarchism maintains a symbiotic relationship with the Mexican Integralist movement as developed by Abascal alongside the great ‘cultural caudillo’ José Vasconcelos and Mexico’s surviving clergy and aristocracy, linking the two Far-Right political movements into one ‘Synarchointegralist’ coalition jointly aimed at saving Mexico with faith and fire while mixing ideas between the two groups - much to the chagrin of the Urquiza and his radical clique who now struggle in debate on the merits of republicanism with their new monarchist allies. Also holding tangential links to similar movements across the Catholic Right in places like Austria and Iberia through a shared adherence to the ‘Rerum novarum’ of Pope Leo XIII, Sinarquismo is the Mexican Right’s last chance to fully turn back the clock to a pious time before the Mexican Revolution."

During the process, a concept of a Spanish federation was created, outlining that the Spanish nation would be a hybrid, between pure federalism and centralist Jacobinism. During the first and second Republics of Spain, it was recognized that Spain as a nation was made up of various smaller states, with autonomy given to their regional actors and municipalities.\n\n The Second Republic of Spain saw this idea transformed into the term Integral State, which would see autonomy granted to those regions that had an overwhelming desire for it, for example Galicia, Catalonia and Basque country. The Integral federalist approach has been utilized by various regional parties of Spain as well, with especially more conservative parties like Dereita Galeguista and Liga Catalana aiming for strong state level autonomy within an otherwise unitary state of Spain, imbuing local nationalism with a greater, more macro-level ideal of Hispanic unity, usually with some degree of Iberism mixed in, in rare cases involving Portugal in the greater Iberian Integral Federation. While the political programs of Integral Federalists may vary widely, and even the degree of federalism that different parties aim for may be completely different, the core value is the belief that Spain, as a nation, is inherently an unified concept, and that regional actors are better off under the wider umbrella of a Spanish nation than as a separatist, independent nations."

Maurism developed naturally as an alternative to the canovismo era, establishing itself as a regeneration of the conservative movement, willing to even engage in street brawls to further its causes. Maurism relies on corporatist, interventionists and nationalist principles, and despite attempts to woo workers, Maurism still draws most of its support from the middle class and right-wing intellectuals. Regenerationism of Spanish empire was also an important part of the ideology, and it occasionally took ideas from Charles Maurras’ Action Francaise. Maurism was never officially endorsed by Antonio Maura himself, and due to this rather loose association of Maurists, the movement developed into different strands, each associating with one another but differing rather significantly in political programs.\n\n Gabriel Maura led a more liberal wing of the Maurists, Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo focused on the social Catholic wing of the movement while Antonio Goicoechea was perhaps the most radical Maurist, advocating for an “organic democracy”, anti-liberal and at times monarchist Spain. Maurism evolved into a somewhat cohesive movement with the formation of Partido Maurista, but the lack of unity has historically led to factionalism and formation of splinter parties.

While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary. Ultimately, the political creation of Huey Long is a personalist vehicle not unlike those in Southern America, being everything to his die-hard supporters, while willing to borrow and utilize any idea that will ensure continued dominance of the AFP, Huey Long and ensure that every man can be king."

Due to this inherently broad descriptor, an oligarchy can take the form of a mercantile republic, a state dominated by corporate interests, or even a fiercely meritocratic regime that emphasizes the role of an intelligent elite as the forefront of administration. Furthermore, Oligarchism can be remarkably different in how it determines who shall wield the power, with some oligarchies having a racial basis for their hierarchy. Oligarchs themselves typically come from backgrounds of immense wealth, causing them to be derided as only caring about their own power over the well-being of the nation itself as they continue to safeguard their capital and remain corrupted with nepotism. Regardless of such claims, oligarchies, diverse as they are, can still take a shape of rather libertine governance, so long as the power of the privileged few remains assured."

With a monarchic Head of State who wields the power to appoint governmental officials, including the Head of Government themselves, and a restrictive three-class voting system that functionally favors the wealthy, Prussian Constitutionalism is designed towards enshrining an 'enlightened' form of monarchism and elitism as an unshakeable status quo. Despite these aforementioned characteristics, however, Prussian Constitutionalism remains compromising towards democratic ideas by forcing members of the legislature to be elected via a vote by the Empire's citizens, granting the populace governmental influence. Prussian Constitutionalism also involves an influential military as the Emperor alone remains the superior of the Imperial Army, leading to little checks on martial ambitions.\n\nWhile Prussian Constitutionalism started in Germany, the Kaiserreich's success in the Weltkrieg has led to many traditional monarchies to adopt some of the example set by the Kaiser in trying to maintain their power while still granting the people a bit more of a say in the dealings of the state. These states regularly change and rework various sections of the German constitution as they write their own to fit their needs, often becoming entirely new systems, and various states that merely exercise a semi-constitutional monarchy with a deeply strengthened monarchic executive will also often be described as Prussian Constitutionalist in nature, even if they have no relation to the German Empire at all."

This wide range can be seen by looking at only a few rural movements, such as the German national revolutionary Landvolkbewegung or the conservative and monarchist Bund der Landwirte, the more centrist Czech RSZML or the Finnish Maalaisliitto, and even the radicals in terms of social changes such as Poland's PSL Wyzwolenia or Bulgaria's BZNS."

This strange ideology has evolved overtime, now reappearing in lands seemingly too civilized for this archaic way of life, and yet it still persists. In the case of places like Fiume, the Dual Cities were pushed to the brink, resorting to piracy in a bid to keep themselves afloat, both literally and financially. Due to its bellicose nature, Pirate Republicanism is usually incredibly strict and very loyalty-based, only promoting those of the highest merit with little regard to birth. Direct Democracy is used on board ships and within the army, but there are no elections to elect the Dual Governor or the city council in the case of Fiume, or the governments of other similar regimes. Pirate Republics are only usually willing to work with those they believe can be trusted or those that can help lessen the pirate plight. This strange ideology is uncompromising in the face of pursuing its unique goals and places heavy emphasis on cooperation and the wise management of funding, as well as within the idea of developing a "cult of personality" around the executive, being the Dual Governor, or Grand Admiral in Fiume’s case - the main progenitor of this weird ideology."

The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society.

Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations.

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper. Seeking to attain the near-godhood of the Masters while living their best lives in search of wisdom and enlightenment, Theosophists and their varied philosophy may have little in common across the different political and socioeconomic systems that push their truth, but all true Theosophists can still find light under the Absolute."

Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered.

Literally meaning 'Whoeverism', the term has been adopted by the movement in a sort of mockery against the supposedly 'politically aware' classes that decry this populist anti-establishment stance, best characterized by one of their slogans Abbasso tutti! or 'Down with everyone!'. Giannini sees the State as inherently untrustworthy, having grown tired of its intrusion into people's private lives, and thus advocates for a purely 'technical' government with a single one year term politician that'd work like a dutiful accountant, administrating the minimized state and leaving after his job was done. The day-to-day running of the nation would be left to local committees with clerks directly responsible before the voters. Vowing to fight against both collectivist socialists and the big business capitalists, Qualunquismo advocates outline a reform plan for the nation that would include limits on taxation, removal of the government from social life and enshrinement of individual's economic liberty. Because of these positions, the movement has been compared and sometimes even equated to multiple right libertarian tendencies and ideologies. Surprising many observers, Giannini's Common Man's Front contains certain monarchist tendencies, seemingly seeing a monarch that governs but not rules as acceptable if the choice had to be made between the crown or the disdained ethical imperialists of mass parties.

Firstly, concerning political matters, the transformation of the parliamentary republic, seen as weak and ineffective, into a strong, legalistic presidential regime where parliamentary unity behind the figure of the president would be self-evident is advocated for. Like the majority of the French right, de la Rocque is in favor of women's suffrage, but also family suffrage, consisting in granting an additional suffrage when a family is formed, i.e. a household with one or more children. An end to the anti-clerical policies of the Radicals and a return to Catholicism as a guide to life, through charity and social aid for example, although the Colonel's supporters are divided between those simply wishing cooperation with the Church and others a full-blown state Catholicism. The promotion of non-ethnic patriotism, the Colonel being notably opposed to anti-Semitism, which is rare in the French political landscape, although some members of his party still hold these views, de la Rocque is also in favor of cooperation between the differents European countries as, in his own words, 'a kind of federation of states belonging to the same civilization, dominated by major common interests'. On the economic front, corporatism and class collaboration are supported, although some criticize the fact that these would mainly favor the industrialists who finance the party, such as François Coty, and a non-radical extension of workers' rights, like the establishment of minimum wage for example.

More unusual of the Chief's thoughts present themselves in the creation of the Commonwealth Corporation, absorbing and subjugating many aspects of private businesses, similarly to the proposed Central Treasury Bank meant to distribute national credit, free universal education, implementation of all treaties with First Americans and the wide utilization of the Silver Legion structures. However, the most controversial aspects of Pelley's ideology concern his policies regarding certain minorities, such as Appalachian Whites, Deep Southern Blacks and Mexican immigrants, that have been deemed as 'unproductive'. They would become wards of the state and inducted into the 'ward system', deprived of any benefits the citizens have then relegated to labor jobs until they can be properly educated for entry into the Commonwealth.

Such ideas led him to create the anti-Tammany Municipal Ownership League in NYC and then the Independence Party, calling for end to corrupt politicking, reforms and meritocracy with the help of a wide front of unionists, immigrants and established parties. While ideas like municipal ownership of public utilities and belief in meritocracy, although nowadays seen as support for the most successful wealthy individuals, stayed with Hearst he continued to slide towards conservatism. With the USA in crisis Hearst laid the groundwork for the creation of a new party, the National Democrats promising to combat social ills, substance abuse, crime, the red menace and most importantly the dread of the 'Yellow Peril'.

Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them.

At its core, Qadimism places a strong emphasis on the preservation and revitalization of traditional Muslim communal institutions. These include mosques, madrasas, and local communities (mahalla), which are perceived as the bedrock of internal cohesion within the Muslim society. Central to Qadimist ideology is a deep commitment to the Sharia, the Islamic legal system. Qadimists viewed the Sharia as not only a legal framework but also as a means of safeguarding the specific interests of the Muslim community within the Russian Empire. This involved a resistance to the encroachment of secular influences on educational and judicial institutions, which Qadimists believe would compromise the collective identity and cohesion of the Muslim community.\n\nQadimism stands in ideological opposition to reformist movements, such as the Jadidism, which advocate for modernization and adaptation to changing circumstances. The conflict between Qadimists and reformists revolves around differing interpretations of the roles and goals of social and cultural institutions. Qadimists argue for the administration and redistribution of wealth by communal institutions like mosques, emphasizing the communal welfare over individual accumulation of wealth. The movement also critiques the emergence of a new intellectual class, often educated in European or Ottoman universities, that promotes secularization. Qadimists express skepticism toward these intellectuals, perceiving them as a threat to the traditional social order maintained by religious leaders (Mullahs) and existing community structures. In defending traditional Islamic education, Qadimists resist the introduction of reformed \"Jadid\" schools, championing the preservation of the established way of teaching in maktab and madrasa settings. This resistance is driven by the belief that maintaining traditional educational methods is essential for the cohesion and well-being of the Muslim community."

Popularized as a natural response to Russia’s increasingly imperialist policies, the Altaians sought to distinguish themselves from the surrounding tribes and to cement their own distinct ethnic identity in the face of possible cultural annihilation by embracing the new faith en masse. Originally millenarian, charismatic, and anti-shamanic all in an attempt to completely revolutionize Altaic culture and society so that it may survive the sweeping tide of modernity, Burkhanism has adapted to drop much of these aspects, becoming more routine and more rooted in Altai’s pre-existing folk religion and shamanistic bases, while also coalescing around an institutionalized hierarchy of oral epic singers that serves as the clergy and theocratic administrative and judicial body of the faith. Overall, Burkhanist religious ideas are a syncretistic mix of varied pre-shamanist, shamanist, Tibetan Buddhist, Tengrist, and Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs, though it is not viewed as being a sub-sect of any of these larger faiths, instead being its own distinct thing largely focused on Altaic national salvation, though some forms of the faith advocate broader ideas such as unity with the Tuvans or even all of Pan-Mongolia. Controversially, Ak Jang has also been hijacked and further developed by the Kalmyk-born Mongolian warlord Dambiijanstan, aka Ja Lama, who sees himself as the prophesied reincarnation of the messianic hero Amursana while preaching a far more violent and ethno-supremacist bastardization of Ak-Jang driven by savage banditry and geared towards the total destruction of the Chinese as revenge for their past crimes against the Oirat-Altaic people of old Dzungaria and beyond, but aside from this radical off-shoot not recognized by the main high choir, the White Faith is largely centered in Altai proper while promoting far more agreeable and peaceful ideas aimed at ensuring that Altaic culture and their very way of life endures."

Andino has also found inspiration within many European rightist movements such as Legionarism, resulting in a drive to create a new model citizen of Honduras. Due to the vision being based on the Mestizo population perceived as heirs to the Mayan Empire, the government of Andino began campaigns of discrimination targeting the African-Amerindian Garifuna minority. Ultimately, 'El Cariato' became not only a very model of order and efficiency for fellow Central American autocrats, but also a keen sponsor and provider of safe haven for those exiled from their birthright such as Nicaragua's Somozoa and his Guardia Nacional."

authdem_kritarchy_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Kritarchy)§!\n\nKritarchy, also called kritocracy or krytocracy - or erroneously known as jusritocracy or jurocracy in an admixture of Latin and Greek, describes a system of rule governed by judges or a wider judicial/legal apparatus, despite whether such an authority comes from a centralized legal body or from more decentralized cultural customs. Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century. However, these old, dusty relics from times medieval and ancient are not the only examples, other more contemporary kritarchies have survived outside Europe, being seen in the traditional Xeer legal system of clannist Somalia, or in the eyes of some modern scholars, being apparent within the government of the United States of America thanks to the landmark SCOTUS case Marbury v. Madison in 1803, which in the eyes of many scholars knocked the Supreme Court of the United States off the rails of checks and balances and down the slippery slope towards judicial rule. Even seen as a form of proto Anti-Statism by some fringe Libertarian and Anarchist scholars, Kritarchies are wildly varied and hotly debated, for many academics debate and doubt the veracity of many of these examples as true kritarchies, but regardless, they can be united along with other forms of government like them in their general adherence to judicial law and legalist governance."

Poujade believes that the middle class - butchers, bakers, grocers, booksellers... for example - have a duty to revolt, not excluding the Far-Right Leagues-inspired violent methods common among Poujadists, to impose respect for their way of life; a simple, conservative, non-ideological way of life. Poujade also fight what he perceives as the domination of the North in French politics and economics, and wants to revitalize the South by making agricultural workers the equals of urban workers. A form of 'soft corporatism' is promoted by Poujade, in which each profession is respected, the Poujadists also rejects the intellectualism of the elites and academics in favor of the 'common sense' of the people. Poujade also expressed an anti-British stance, albeit a moderate one compared to certain radical nationalists. Some observers, however, describe Poujade as a demagogue, taking advantage of uneducated people by playing on their irritation with politics."

To the most radical wing of the DkP, the Empire of today has failed by allowing itself to be overrun with liberal weaklings and socialist zealots, and thus a new Bismarck, free from Reichstag and Kaiser’s interference, is required to set things in order. A popular military man in the spirit of Julius Caesar that shall lead a rebirth of the state, one who can galvanize the masses with charisma that sweeps away the destitution of modernity. Demanding an ambitious programme of paternal “state socialism”, alongside youth movements instilling patriotic and Christian values in the future generations of Germany, the Vorbeckists have their sights on something grander than just Europe. Borrowing concepts from Ernst Jünger’s “Die totale Mobilmachung”, although disagreeing with the negative outlook on “rationalized” mass mobilization, they believe that a soldier represents the highest form of humanity, and only through total conscription shall heroes be born. New models upon whom the Weltreich shall be unified in glory, just like the Prussian Kingdom did for the Germans of old. Through the highest sacrifice, previously paid by the Afrikan Schutztruppe, will the German warrior-elites enlighten the cowardly masses of the far-flung territories of the Kaiserreich.

Its roots lie in a resistance movement against Modernism, both artistically and ideologically, and it has often been considered a polar opposite of avantgardism promoted by the artists of the Internationale. Noucentisme, is at its core, a Catalan nationalist movement, deeply immersed in conservatism, and at times, wider Spanish regionalism instead of full-fledged separatism from Spain. Noucentists differ from the more traditionalist conservatives of Catalonia, such as the Carlists and Vigatanists, by embracing a limited degree of modern values in addition to their Catholic faith. Noucentists embraced city life as the new polis of the modern era, with Barcelona becoming a sort of new city state of old Greek and Roman eras, combating the reactionary barbarism of the countryside.\n\n Supported mainly by liberal and conservative bourgeoisie, Noucentists valued order, civility and classicism above all else, and in their views, the transformation of the real, tangible Catalonia of the present could be transformed into this ideal, harmonic and flawless Catalonia through a systematic reform of Catalan institutions through the Commonwealth of Catalonia to protect them from Spanish influences, the promotion and development of Catalan language through the Institut d'Estudis Catalans. Noucentisme was influenced heavily by the writer and philosopher Eugeni d'Ors, as well as politician Enric Prat de la Riba, and mainly due to its conservative origins, it gained traction among Liga Regionalista. While its influence has largely vaned among Catalan politics due to the repression of the Spanish military, after independence Noucentisme has begun to return in force thanks to the need to codify Catalan conservatism in the face of ongoing left-wing hegemony."

maurism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Maurism)§!\n\nMaurism is a highly influential political movement in Spain, centred around the ideas of Antonio Maura and his son, Gabriel Maura. Conservative, nationalists and easily adaptable to both republican and monarchist systems of Spain, it began its relevancy in 1913 following a split in the Spanish Conservative Party. Maurism developed naturally as an alternative to the canovismo era, establishing itself as a regeneration of the conservative movement, willing to even engage in street brawls to further its causes. Maurism relies on corporatist, interventionists and nationalist principles, and despite attempts to woo workers, Maurism still draws most of its support from the middle class and right-wing intellectuals. Regenerationism of Spanish empire was also an important part of the ideology, and it occasionally took ideas from Charles Maurras’ Action Francaise. Maurism was never officially endorsed by Antonio Maura himself, and due to this rather loose association of Maurists, the movement developed into different strands, each associating with one another but differing rather significantly in political programs.\n\n Gabriel Maura led a more liberal wing of the Maurists, Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo focused on the social Catholic wing of the movement while Antonio Goicoechea was perhaps the most radical Maurist, advocating for an “organic democracy”, anti-liberal and at times monarchist Spain. Maurism evolved into a somewhat cohesive movement with the formation of Partido Maurista, but the lack of unity has historically led to factionalism and formation of splinter parties. While not particularly significant on its own, its ideological importance came primarily from inspiring various future right-wing politicians in Spain, such as Jose Calvo Sotelo."

If one was to look for the origins of the idea they would find the French sociologist Émile Durkheim and the German Catholic economist Heinrich Pesch. Durkheim postulated a system dubbed 'Corporate Solidarism', which would eliminate anomies generating class conflict by reforming society according to the principles of organic solidarity. These would be ensured through the formation of single public institutions based on professions. Pesch, while holding similar believes, emphasized the crucial value of the 'Socialization of Persons' through labor unions, guilds and chambers of commerce. Heavinly influenced by heavily Catholic corporatists and himself influential on Christian Democrats, he envisioned a world of humanist international of patriotic states built on the pillar that is family. \n\nNowadays, the most influential group representing Solidarism would be the National Union of the New Generation, a party originating from a Russian youth movement growing up in the aftermath of the Civil War and Kerenskyist failures. Railing against the 'sins and prejudices of the past', thus limiting membership based on age, the NSNP hopes to transform their homeland into a tolerant civic nationalist state built on foundations of religious charity, societal cooperation, individual liberty and property, finalized agrarian reform and eternal vigil against socialistic radicalism. Although predominantly republican, there are some who hold monarchist sympathies, but both agree on the importance of democratic modes of participation. Among the Union’s most notable members would be Viktor Baydalakov, the party’s leader, and Arkady Stolypin, son of the infamous Tsarist prime minister. The NSNP is not the only solidarist organization, as one also has to note Verdinaso, the Union of Dutch National Solidarists, or factions within Norway’s Nasjonal Samling."

Staunchly anti-Elitist, this American variant also largely supports the ideals of former President Andrew Jackson, as well as Jeffersonianism, Utilitarianism, Classical Liberalism, Liberal Conservatism, Populism, Laissez-Faire economics, and the American ideal of Manifest Destiny amid claims that it is also racially motivated and wildly Nationalist while accelerating Jeffersonian notions of a strong executive to Jacksonian ideas of a near-supreme one."

To call the Kingfish's programme wide would be an understatement, for his ideological musings combine elements from all sides of the spectrum while tying them together with the aura of populism serving the common folk. Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary.

Ranging from pseudo-Republican elected Tribal Chairmen to full hereditary Chiefdoms that function in a similar but less ostentatious way to European Monarchies, these governments are united in their reverence for the past traditions of their peoples, and in their dedication to provide non-Socialist paternal populism to their masses so that all within society may prosper.

The greatest influences on far-rights' most popular strain after the Weltkrieg are Hungary's Gyula Gömbös and his Szeged Idea, while the most successful and widely emulated party is Romania's Legion of the Archangel Michael, more commonly known as the Iron Guard led by the mystical Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Legionarist parties put the people of their nation, often defined by a shared blood, a common folk hostile to the 'foreign corruptors' inhabiting their lands, on the forefront of their policy. They strive to achieve a mythical 'Palingenesis', a rebirth of their people united by common values such as shared desired for revenge, a strong faith sometimes expressed in a borderline mystical Church or the activation of the vital forces of the youth enrolled into fanatical paramilitaries sharing the renewed nation's guiding principle of self-sacrifice and martyrdom for the common cause. Economically, many have borrowed yet another thing from the ANI, that being Corporatism although other forms of reshaping the economy are also found.

As such, Minarchists tread this tightrope carefully as they use the night-watchman system to provide the masses a form of court system, military, and police force not originating from the State, but from the free masses themselves, creating a society free from tyranny that maintains the NAP and protects the public from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, enforcing property laws, and other encroachments on their inalienable freedoms, liberties, and rights."

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper. Seeking to attain the near-godhood of the Masters while living their best lives in search of wisdom and enlightenment, Theosophists and their varied philosophy may have little in common across the different political and socioeconomic systems that push their truth, but all true Theosophists can still find light under the Absolute."

Not only was the South neglected, it was subject to brutal mass repression and killing campaign targeting civilians under the pretense of combating supposed 'brigandage', despite the so-called briganti being nothing more than true freedom fighters harkening back to the times of resistance against Napoleonic invaders. In terms of political backing resurgent Bourbonism found many allies across the Catholic laity and the clergy still bitter over the Roman Question and emboldened by the fall of the Savoyard kingdom. The most prominent writer-intellectual of Neoborbonismo, free to speak his mind after the autonomist dream was unshackled when the South was abandoned during the collapse of the North to the Socialist forces, is Carlo Alianello, heralded by many as the righteous revisionist of the falsified vision presented by the standard narratives of the Italian 'Unification'."

Due to this inherently broad descriptor, an oligarchy can take the form of a mercantile republic, a state dominated by corporate interests, or even a fiercely meritocratic regime that emphasizes the role of an intelligent elite as the forefront of administration. Furthermore, Oligarchism can be remarkably different in how it determines who shall wield the power, with some oligarchies having a racial basis for their hierarchy. Oligarchs themselves typically come from backgrounds of immense wealth, causing them to be derided as only caring about their own power over the well-being of the nation itself as they continue to safeguard their capital and remain corrupted with nepotism. Regardless of such claims, oligarchies, diverse as they are, can still take a shape of rather libertine governance, so long as the power of the privileged few remains assured."

Contemporary Yugoslavism is largely split between two dominant subtypes, being the integrationists who favored integral Yugoslavism while promoting unitarism, centralization, and the rapid total unification of the South Slavic ethnic and linguistic groups into a single Yugoslav nation, even by coercion if necessary, and the federalists which advocated for the autonomy of each slice of historic South Slavic lands in the form of a diverse federation that would slowly work towards total unification at a gradual pace, and without outside pressure. However, despite their differences, both subsects agree on the concept of National Oneness developed as an expression of the strategic alliance of South Slavs in Austria-Hungary, and as a reaction to the rise of Germanization, Trialism, and Magyarization running rampant throughout the empire hellbent on either snuffing out the South Slavs or subjugating use to Vienna for good, thus giving credence to the concept that the South Slavs belong to a single ‘race’, are of ‘one blood’, and hold a shared language. Divided on matters of economics or governance, with monarchist, republican, reactionary, and socialist variants all being on the rise, it is this oneness of race, tongue, culture, and history that should be focused on first instead, so that the idea of South Slavic unity can be uplifted, united, and supported to create a prosperous future for our related peoples."

Firstly, concerning political matters, the transformation of the parliamentary republic, seen as weak and ineffective, into a strong, legalistic presidential regime where parliamentary unity behind the figure of the president would be self-evident is advocated for. Like the majority of the French right, de la Rocque is in favor of women's suffrage, but also family suffrage, consisting in granting an additional suffrage when a family is formed, i.e. a household with one or more children. An end to the anti-clerical policies of the Radicals and a return to Catholicism as a guide to life, through charity and social aid for example, although the Colonel's supporters are divided between those simply wishing cooperation with the Church and others a full-blown state Catholicism. The promotion of non-ethnic patriotism, the Colonel being notably opposed to anti-Semitism, which is rare in the French political landscape, although some members of his party still hold these views, de la Rocque is also in favor of cooperation between the differents European countries as, in his own words, 'a kind of federation of states belonging to the same civilization, dominated by major common interests'. On the economic front, corporatism and class collaboration are supported, although some criticize the fact that these would mainly favor the industrialists who finance the party, such as François Coty, and a non-radical extension of workers' rights, like the establishment of minimum wage for example. Although presenting themselves as 'moderates', the use of paramilitaries and sometimes violence leads some to classify the CDF as just another Far-Right League."

Dzierzgowski posits that monarchy is the form of government most fit to the biological laws that govern the organic world, as can be seen by the self-preservation instinct which clearly crystalizes in the unbroken line of family establishing dynasty then a tribe, a nation and ultimately a state. Such an instinct can also be observed in a parents' love for their offspring, paralleled by the sovereigns attitude to his subjects, a thing which cannot be observed in any democracy for it does not even exist in the natural world. To Scientific Monarchists such a system is not a rule of the people, but their mass psychosis that needs to be eliminated and replaced by people raised from birth to lead a professional nation required in such an advanced era. Dzierzgowski's ideology advocates for a meritocratic society bound by a socio-biological sense of community, enforced by a strong rule of the monarch helped by vital youthful leadership of the best specimens, the utter destruction of democratic delusions and constant combating of disruptive foreign social 'parasites', all tied with the creation of an eugenic programme."

However, the most controversial aspects of Pelley's ideology concern his policies regarding certain minorities, such as Appalachian Whites, Deep Southern Blacks and Mexican immigrants, that have been deemed as 'unproductive'.

Such ideas led him to create the anti-Tammany Municipal Ownership League in NYC and then the Independence Party, calling for end to corrupt politicking, reforms and meritocracy with the help of a wide front of unionists, immigrants and established parties. While ideas like municipal ownership of public utilities and belief in meritocracy, although nowadays seen as support for the most successful wealthy individuals, stayed with Hearst he continued to slide towards conservatism. With the USA in crisis Hearst laid the groundwork for the creation of a new party, the National Democrats promising to combat social ills, substance abuse, crime, the red menace and most importantly the dread of the 'Yellow Peril'. Hearstian Democracy is a system in which the able entrepreneur is upheld as a role model, granted generous benefits of slashed taxation, trade unions are nationalized into a system dubbed 'American Corporatism', socialists, immigrant wastrels perpetuating drug abuse and any other crook are diligently caught by the politicized Federal Police. Beyond that Hearst calls for nationalization of alcohol, an idea influenced by the failure of the dry counties, the conquest of nature to build infrastructure and industry for the Californian Dream, and creation of the National Industrial Organization regulating wages and price gouging while promoting class collaboration. All of this tied with full control over the media, the state apparatus and international isolation, although any traitor and bandit beyond the border will not have the luxury of escaping Hearst's spirit, the same one that called for the war with Spain back in 1898."

Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them.

The very basic idea is that the royalty in elective monarchies does not ascend onto the throne by the grace of a divine being itself, but through a compact made by the influential classes and the nobility of their realm. The most famous examples of such entities in history have been the Holy Roman Empire, where the vast network of different feudal realms nonetheless ended up re-electing the same Habsburg family which monopolized the Kaiser's throne, and on the other end of the spectrum the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in which the king was truly subservient to the magnate class which not only held vast lands but also sway among the lower nobility. These two examples illustrate the inherent differences in how elective monarchies around the world are run, for some have become merely a facade that facilitates purely dynastical inheritance, although in a less 'autocratic' way due to the supposed consent of the electors, while in others the appointed monarch is nothing more than a figurehead for the grey eminance behind the throne to do as they please with. A less common, yet very peculiar, trend has also been the creation and transformation of previously existing governments into a sort-of 'crowned republics', where the monarch is chosen by what was formerly the political strata and ultimately serves the same purpose as any president or prime minister, just with the royal decorum instituted upon them."

At its core, Qadimism places a strong emphasis on the preservation and revitalization of traditional Muslim communal institutions. These include mosques, madrasas, and local communities (mahalla), which are perceived as the bedrock of internal cohesion within the Muslim society. Central to Qadimist ideology is a deep commitment to the Sharia, the Islamic legal system. Qadimists viewed the Sharia as not only a legal framework but also as a means of safeguarding the specific interests of the Muslim community within the Russian Empire. This involved a resistance to the encroachment of secular influences on educational and judicial institutions, which Qadimists believe would compromise the collective identity and cohesion of the Muslim community.\n\nQadimism stands in ideological opposition to reformist movements, such as the Jadidism, which advocate for modernization and adaptation to changing circumstances. The conflict between Qadimists and reformists revolves around differing interpretations of the roles and goals of social and cultural institutions. Qadimists argue for the administration and redistribution of wealth by communal institutions like mosques, emphasizing the communal welfare over individual accumulation of wealth. The movement also critiques the emergence of a new intellectual class, often educated in European or Ottoman universities, that promotes secularization. Qadimists express skepticism toward these intellectuals, perceiving them as a threat to the traditional social order maintained by religious leaders (Mullahs) and existing community structures. In defending traditional Islamic education, Qadimists resist the introduction of reformed \"Jadid\" schools, championing the preservation of the established way of teaching in maktab and madrasa settings. This resistance is driven by the belief that maintaining traditional educational methods is essential for the cohesion and well-being of the Muslim community."

Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century.

Sinarquismo is divided between two main factions, the revolutionary nationalists and national syndicalists of Urquiza, and the orthodox millenarians and assorted advocates of ‘Catholic Social Order’ headed by Abascal, while a small subfaction pushes in a more ‘moderate’ and semi-democratic direction by advocating either a union with the National Action Party or a transition of the National Synarchist Union into an official party of its own in order to garner wider public support, but both are moves detested by most true Synarchists due to their deep-seated hatred for democracy. Synarchists all agree that Leftism, Liberalism, and Atheism are the three worst things to haunt the modern world despite the other minor differences that divide them, and as such all factions seek to return to a more traditional and ultra-conservative platform under a supreme executive so that Mexico can be cleansed of sin, while also incorporating other varied ideas such as national conservatism, anti-populist class collaboration, Catholic theocratism, integral nationalism, Rightist communalism, and corporatist statism. Additionally, Synarchism maintains a symbiotic relationship with the Mexican Integralist movement as developed by Abascal alongside the great ‘cultural caudillo’ José Vasconcelos and Mexico’s surviving clergy and aristocracy, linking the two Far-Right political movements into one ‘Synarchointegralist’ coalition jointly aimed at saving Mexico with faith and fire while mixing ideas between the two groups - much to the chagrin of the Urquiza and his radical clique who now struggle in debate on the merits of republicanism with their new monarchist allies.

Maurism developed naturally as an alternative to the canovismo era, establishing itself as a regeneration of the conservative movement, willing to even engage in street brawls to further its causes. Maurism relies on corporatist, interventionists and nationalist principles, and despite attempts to woo workers, Maurism still draws most of its support from the middle class and right-wing intellectuals. Regenerationism of Spanish empire was also an important part of the ideology, and it occasionally took ideas from Charles Maurras’ Action Francaise. Maurism was never officially endorsed by Antonio Maura himself, and due to this rather loose association of Maurists, the movement developed into different strands, each associating with one another but differing rather significantly in political programs.\n\n Gabriel Maura led a more liberal wing of the Maurists, Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo focused on the social Catholic wing of the movement while Antonio Goicoechea was perhaps the most radical Maurist, advocating for an “organic democracy”, anti-liberal and at times monarchist Spain. Maurism evolved into a somewhat cohesive movement with the formation of Partido Maurista, but the lack of unity has historically led to factionalism and formation of splinter parties.

The greatest extent of Integrist relevance was during the founding of Partido Integrista, and while the party has mostly fallen into irrelevance, it continues as a minor current within Basque traditionalism and Carlist extremism. Theorized originally by prominent traditionalists such as Ramón Nocedal and Juan Olazábal, Integrism differs from the traditional dividing lines of Spanish traditionalism, which usually are separated by the dynastic lines, with Carlists and Alfonsists theorizing on their own variations on traditionalist thought.\n\n Integrists in turn do not have a selected monarch to support, and in the 1920s and 1930s the movement adopted accidentalism, an ambivalence to working within the frameworks of monarchy and republic alike, into their program, and as the movement has been sidelined by more mainstream traditionalists, aspects of mysticism and millenarianism have creeped into the movement, with some Integros even supporting crowning Jesus Christ as the symbolic king of Spain, to rule the nation as the end times approach due to the diabolic false gods of Syndicalism and Liberalism. In the view of Integrists, the ideal state is one made up of various natural organisms, be they trade unions, corporations or even family structures, and the state itself is merely there to ensure that this organism runs in practice.\n\n The Integrists approach all social issues from the point of view of religion, seeing poverty, inequality and regionalist issue as the creation of liberal failures to create true equality in a way that a truly Catholic society would be able to achieve. In practice, Integrists believe in a state run by those most capable and pious to do so, as their electoral successes have proven that Integrists most often prefer the opinions of experts to those of politicians, and their mistrust of politicians is equally evident in their vehement distaste for any form of democratic organization. While not particularly different from mainline Carlism in practice, its stubborn disregard for solving social issues in any way other than religious one, and fundamentalist approach to Catholicism causes even traditionalists of deep faith from other parties to find the movement dangerous and frightening, if obscure, political force."

Charles Maurras contrasts the 'legal country' represented by the Republic and its elites, supported by the four 'confederate states': the Jews, the Protestants, the Freemasons, and the foreigners, the 'Anti-France', with the 'real country', which represents all the French people. Maurras' doctrine is based on the unity of society, a society that must function organically on the model of the Ancien Régime. The Action Française thus rejects the French Revolution and its consequences in order to establish a decentralized, traditional, localist and federal monarchy, with political powers concentrated in provincial assemblies with the King as the great national arbiter, while promoting Catholicism as the cement of national unity. On the intellectual level, Maurras emphasizes reason and Classicism and opposes Romanticism."

pataut_toryism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Toryism)§!\n\nToryism, also known as British Conservatism, is a broad family of traditionalist conservative thoughts and parties originating in the United Kingdom and her various current or former colonies. Despite the word Tory itself coming from a pejorative against Irish Catholics before being applied as a slur against supporters of King James II, Toryism later morphed into a colloquialism used to describe the major right-wing party in Great Britain. The ideological beginnings of British Conservatism are believed to be the Cavalier faction of the English Civil War, with later centuries bringing the influence of Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger. Policy-wise Toryism is characterized as highly socially-conservative, deeply Anglican, anti-liberal and very often pro-monarchist. In terms of the economy, it often fluctuates between supporting a free-market or protectionism, with many internal schisms fought over that issue. Because of the width of the label, some Tory politicians are hard to fit entirely into aforementioned criteria, which led to terms such as Red Tory or High Tory being spawned to describe such intricacies in policy."

While the specifics differ from movement to movement, broadly speaking Integralism pushes for the total end of Church and State separation, the restoration or empowerment of a Monarch, the end of class struggle, and the decentralization of the state into an organic system in which each aspect of the state functions as an independent but cooperative organ working in unison with its counterparts. Frequently egalitarian in some regards despite its Nationalist slant, Integralism and its derivatives are a group of Christian-dominated political oddities."

The conduct of a theocracy is very often determined by the respective people's religion, and thus their differences vary intensively. Charitably communitarian clergies or opulent priests allied to local aristocracy, and all in-between, all easily exist beneath the umbrella of theocratic forms of government.\n\nFundamentalist Theocracies push their religious views to a notable extreme, likely believing in aggressive proselytization or a militant resistance to atheistic and heretical foreign powers. Alongside this view, such theocracies typically sanctify even formerly secular sections of the nation such as the military or civil service.

Combining many progressive policies such as the breakdown of old elitist institutions and sweeping land reform with nationalist and authoritarian tendencies shown in creation of youth paramilitaries, ideas of ethnic supremacist national rebirth, Savinkovism aims to syncretise both the left and the right, forming a true synthesis which would reform the nation and bring it into modernity. Despite progress being often at a forefront of their policies, groups advocating Savinkov's design often rely on traditional nationalist tendencies and dominant religions for support, although the clerical establishment is often sidelined or fought against, with some groups being even outright secularist. Ultimately, the most important aspect of Savinkovism is total devotion to the Vozhd and undying loyalty, with his followers being ready to execute his will by any means necessary. Although the ideology originated in Russia and is originally very central to that nation in its ideas, many populist nationalist movements, often led by youthful and charismatic leaders, around the former Russian Empire and even beyond have adopted elements if not an outright majority of Savinkovist ideals mixed and modified to fit with the local sensibilities."

solidarism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Solidarism)§!\n\nAs a political term Solidarism represents a broad combination of various different thoughts and movements, many of them close to corporatism, especially the Christian variety, yet still distinct. If one was to look for the origins of the idea they would find the French sociologist Émile Durkheim and the German Catholic economist Heinrich Pesch. Durkheim postulated a system dubbed 'Corporate Solidarism', which would eliminate anomies generating class conflict by reforming society according to the principles of organic solidarity. These would be ensured through the formation of single public institutions based on professions. Pesch, while holding similar believes, emphasized the crucial value of the 'Socialization of Persons' through labor unions, guilds and chambers of commerce. Heavinly influenced by heavily Catholic corporatists and himself influential on Christian Democrats, he envisioned a world of humanist international of patriotic states built on the pillar that is family. \n\nNowadays, the most influential group representing Solidarism would be the National Union of the New Generation, a party originating from a Russian youth movement growing up in the aftermath of the Civil War and Kerenskyist failures. Railing against the 'sins and prejudices of the past', thus limiting membership based on age, the NSNP hopes to transform their homeland into a tolerant civic nationalist state built on foundations of religious charity, societal cooperation, individual liberty and property, finalized agrarian reform and eternal vigil against socialistic radicalism. Although predominantly republican, there are some who hold monarchist sympathies, but both agree on the importance of democratic modes of participation. Among the Union’s most notable members would be Viktor Baydalakov, the party’s leader, and Arkady Stolypin, son of the infamous Tsarist prime minister. The NSNP is not the only solidarist organization, as one also has to note Verdinaso, the Union of Dutch National Solidarists, or factions within Norway’s Nasjonal Samling."

Chiefly agrarian, and minorly Pagan in influence though zealously Orthodox in practice as it pulls from Slavic and Scythian Paganism in order to purify and defend the Russian Orthodox faith from foreign perversion and semitic influence, Scythianism seeks to create an agriculturally-based peasant's state built around ideas of ecological preservation, nature worship, Pagan aesthetics fused with Orthodox tradition, Russo-centric esoteric nationalism and spiritualism, reduced industrialization, anti-modernity, and the uplifting of the warrior and farmer castes all under the watch and leadership of the Green Vozhd and his Green Legions."

Tracing their roots back to Russia's most powerful Black-Hundredist organization called the Union of the Russian People, the French extreme right League of Patriots organized by Paul Déroulède in support of 'Général Revanche' Georges Ernest Boulanger and the German National Association of Commercial Employees, Legionarism drew from these reactionary, highly militant, anti-socialist, anti-semetic and racially supremacist movements for inspiration. The greatest influences on far-rights' most popular strain after the Weltkrieg are Hungary's Gyula Gömbös and his Szeged Idea, while the most successful and widely emulated party is Romania's Legion of the Archangel Michael, more commonly known as the Iron Guard led by the mystical Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Legionarist parties put the people of their nation, often defined by a shared blood, a common folk hostile to the 'foreign corruptors' inhabiting their lands, on the forefront of their policy. They strive to achieve a mythical 'Palingenesis', a rebirth of their people united by common values such as shared desired for revenge, a strong faith sometimes expressed in a borderline mystical Church or the activation of the vital forces of the youth enrolled into fanatical paramilitaries sharing the renewed nation's guiding principle of self-sacrifice and martyrdom for the common cause. Economically, many have borrowed yet another thing from the ANI, that being Corporatism although other forms of reshaping the economy are also found. Above all, Legionaries detest and combat the 'internal enemies', be they communists, masons, minorities of all kinds and whoever else that has bewitched their pure state, one just now awaking, an element that some of the groups enhanced with scriptures taken from the Legione del Risveglio of the near-otherworldly baron Julius Evola.

occultism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Esotericism)§!\n\nEsotericism is a diverse label used to describe various regimes that incorporate Occultism within governmental administration, typically by shifting the qualifications for governance away from political acumen and towards knowledge of hermetic texts, among many other secretive tomes of antiquity. Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them. The most famous proponent of what came to be popularly known as 'esoteric nationalism' is Julius Evola, the Italian thinker who merged concepts of racial aristocratic elite, masculine heroism with pre-existing Western and Eastern spiritual traditions, chief among them Buddhism and Hinduism."

pioism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Padre Pio Thought)§!\n\nBased on the teachings and life of Pio of Pietrelcina, Padre Pio Thought or Pioism is less a formal ideology and more a way of life. Promoting deep faith and obedience to the Catholic Church while at the same time rejecting every form of ideology and even national identity, Padre Pio Thought seeks to create a society where everyone has the best chance to become a saint. It attempts to do this by promoting an incredibly decentralized model of governance, where local authorities make all major and meaningful decisions. The central government ideally would only directly control the armed forces and the educational system, having few other delegated powers. Pioism is by nature incredibly hostile to both Socialism and Nationalism, believing both play equal parts in the Devil’s efforts to prevent people from entering Heaven. As a result, Pioism seeks the destruction of nationhood itself, mostly by the replacement of national myth with an embracing of the Catholic faith. Along with this, Pioism demands the creation of a powerful welfare state, ensuring that all citizens have nothing to trouble them, so that all their energies can be focused on reaching the Beatific Vision. For non-Catholics, Pioism, while not directly hostile to their existence, still treating them as God’s children thus granting them the same access to social services, does not allow them to worship in public. It does not forbid them from worshiping in private, but being a non-Catholic in a Pioist government comes with a certain level of detachment from the rest of society. In short, Pioism seeks to usher in a new era of Catholicism, one where every human person has the ability to reach Heaven, even if it costs everything else. "

Coon - as an endangered and superior racial group, and has been popularized by reactionary figures like Madison Grant, Arthur de Gobineau, Lothrop Stoddard, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, among a myriad of lesser thinkers like William Z. Ripley. Virtually identical to offshoots like Anglo-Saxonism in North America, Australia, and Great Britain, Teutonicism in Germany, and Frankisism in Northern France, Nordicism and these thoughtforms all hold that the shared Nordic phenotype and culture are superior to all others in the world, and profess that the ambitions and needs of these races must be protected and pursued over the needs of any other lesser subhuman peoples. Viewing this Nordic racial group as the bastion of Western Civilization and true Human progress that revitalized Europe after the fall of Rome and gave rise to the modern age of European excellence, this fringe movement of the Far-Right is deeply tied to ideas of ethno-eugenics, anti-Semitism, 19th century Aryanism, and Scientific Racism and the racial sciences considered pseudo-intellectualism by many of those that detract the Nordic truth, but the specific politics and economics behind the movement ranges greatly, with Corporatist Populism, Right-wing Capitalism, Christian Distributism, and even National Syndicalism being popular in some circles, depending on the particular Nordicist sect. Regardless of their differences, all true believers agree that Western Civilization and the White Nordic Race must be protected and pushed to dominance over the apelings of the world at all costs."

Their greatest inspirations are Charles Maurras, as put in their foundational status, and also the racial science of Nordicism. Despite their pro-church stance the electoral platform of the party is officially the separation of church and state as a way to combat the influence of other parties espousing near-slave like devotion to the Vatican. Leopardos share the commitment to nationalism, militarism and corporatism with many other right-wing parties existing all across South America, yet they differ when it comes to racial issues. While most either espouse the superiority of the descendants of the Spanish Conquistadors or try to somehow integrate the native populations the Leopardos view the European 'Aryan' as the highest form of humanity. This has led the movement to support mass immigration of White Europeans to Colombia as a way to rejuvenate the nation and slowly replace the current inhabitants, annihilating the inferior Mestizo caste. Leopardos are ardent believers in the coming of the new race to Colombia and strive to bring a truly conservative revolution to South America and eventually to the whole world."

Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations.

Seeking to create his own patriarchal and totalitarian Duvalier Dynasty that would rule over Haiti as a hereditary, semi-regal dictatorship festooned with West African and Vodou spiritual and cultural symbolisms, Papa Doc reinforces this dream with his own violent paramilitary the Tonton Makout - the Bogeymen of Haiti - who use mysticism and myth to hide their identities as they act as the dark specters of our nation while uplifting himself as the avatar of Baron Samedi - the Haitian Lwa, or God, of Death, leading a Vodou and Kreyol revival by force in order to fully replace ‘White’ religion that has long polluted the minds and souls of the Haitian masses, taking it so far as to use Haitian spiritual healing, black magic, and other practices to cleanse more and more facets of daily life of the European taint. With this spiritual nationalism being paired with brutal authoritarianism, a kleptocratic fusion of corporatism and corrupt capitalism, an immense cult of personality steeped in Vodou mysticism and occultism that holds Papa Doc as the embodiment of the state itself as well as the personification of the Vodou faith, staunch militarism and paramilitarism aimed at complete control of the public and narrative, and a dedication to Afro-Haitian exceptionalism and the wider Pan-African dream, Noirisme Éthéré may be ill-defined, but that matters not to Papa Doc has he holds Haiti in the palm of Baron Samedi’s hands."

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper.

Emerging from the formerly Florence-based futurist group headed by Papini, Ardengo Soffici, Aldo Palazzeschi, and Italo Tavolato which came into direct conflict with the formerly Milan-based Marinettist futurists, Right Futurism has been deeply influenced by the Post-Decadentism movement, which promoted an aesthetic existence of excess and artificiality, alongside many others across the Italian political and cultural spectrum that mirror its creator’s own hectic, contradictory, and paradoxical journey through Italy’s upper crust. Borrowing at different times of his life from Catholic Social Teachings, Anti-Clericalism, Atheism, Individualism, Conservatism, Corporatism, Interventionism, Symbolism, Bergsonite Intuitionism, and Anglo-American Pragmatism to name but a few, Papini’s thought is no doubt highly syncretic, but still hinges on the core principle of rejecting and releasing all connections with the past in order to embrace a perfected concept of an idealized and aesthetically-perfect future outlined by Marinetti’s Manifesto del Futurismo. That does not mean Papinists are entirely aligned with the Left side of their movement when it comes to the way society should be engineered, for the major difference and the reason for the original split was the Florentine group's rejection of what they saw as Milan's 'immobile church with an infallible creed'.

natpop_social_credit_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Social Credit)§!\n\nSocial Credit Theory, or just Social Credit, is a distributive economic philosophy first developed by Anglo philosopher C.H. Douglas that advocates the government issuance of debt-free money directly to its populace, both consumers and producers, to sidestep the issue of economic downturns and the chronic deficiency of purchasing power that has afflicted many post-Weltkrieg economies. Arguing that systems were made for men, and not the other way around, Social Credit seeks to bend financial rules and mainstays in order to ensure absolute economic security for its populace. Called pseudo-Socialism by its detractors on the Right and predatory economics bent on tricking the proletariat by its detractors on the Left, Social Credit Theory is frequently tied to ideas of Christian Distributism, Economic Syncretism, Agrarianism, and other ideas of the Christian Right, even including Radical Environmentalism when including the Kibbo Kift, and proposes a third path in order to create a safe and secure economic utopia for all within the system."

Such development may be induced by the government's increased radicalization or takeover by ultranationalist and far-right ideologues, ones which necessarily have to rely on a strong state apparatus to keep internal peace and secure the borders. National Security States are a final evolution of such processes, state-bound entities in which power has been relegated almost entirely to fanatical security agencies, or nations in which the chiefs-in-charge have decreed that the previous government is no longer able to maintain the national values and order. While the vast majority of the leaders of such states are generally concerned with establishing a 'Republic of the Strongmen', borrowing the Russian term 'Siloviki', some do genuinely believe in the gospel of the parties which had allowed their rise to power. That does not mean, of course, that an 'NSS' shall never break with any tenet previously established, for their main consideration is always how a policy shall ensure the continued national stability and prosperity for their group. Thus, these 'agencies with a state' pursue any and all means necessary to eliminate both internal and external threats which could jeopardize their ambitious mission of creating an ever-watchful nation-state, founded on the principles borrowed from many a rightist movement."

Both an eccentric naturist-naturalist and a Milanese aristocrat, Keller participated in the short-lived Endeavour alongside his closest associate Giovanni Comisso, coordinating the 'Office of Sudden Action' and gathering creative minds from across the entire world. In Fiume, he cooperated with followers of Communism, Anarchism, Utopian Proudhonism, Nietzscheanism, Rosicrucianism, and Nihilism. Among their many accomplishments was the establishment of the People's Academy, focused on encouraging debates about free love, abolition of money, destruction of prisons, and beautification of the city. Despite most members of Unione Yoga originating from Socialist circles, Keller and his followers became disillusioned with this mainstream, chiefly due to the collapse of Lenin's Revolution and the authoritarian turn of Western-based Communard nations. However, the greatest break was caused by Marinetti's alliance with the nascent Totalist movement in Turin, which only hardened the anti-Futurist stance of Keller who believed that theirs was an a-human technology cult, with Futurist art rejecting the most important aspect of creation - the originality and individuality of the artist. After the Civil War, remnants of the Yoga group alongside dissident futurists and legionnaires moved to Veneto to stage their rebellion of free spirits against the established order. The key positions of the 'Union of Free Spirits Tending Towards Perfection' are the creation of a non-racialist 'Dionysian Race' through the exaltation of individualism and free love, ardent anti-capitalism, libertarian activism, and the rejection of existing political systems and their values, alongside various other inspirations from Eastern spiritual traditions. While these are vague ideas and the entire movement is rather loose ideologically, it has garnered enough differences between members to cause a creation of two distinct factions. The first being the 'Brown Lotuses', promoting ideas of an agrarian democracy of small producers, anti-industrialism, strong devotion to nature and abandonment of cities. The 'Red Lotuses' serve as their opposite as a faction closer to avant-garde leftism emphasizing utter contempt towards the bourgeoisie and overwhelming materialism."

Sinarquismo is divided between two main factions, the revolutionary nationalists and national syndicalists of Urquiza, and the orthodox millenarians and assorted advocates of ‘Catholic Social Order’ headed by Abascal, while a small subfaction pushes in a more ‘moderate’ and semi-democratic direction by advocating either a union with the National Action Party or a transition of the National Synarchist Union into an official party of its own in order to garner wider public support, but both are moves detested by most true Synarchists due to their deep-seated hatred for democracy. Synarchists all agree that Leftism, Liberalism, and Atheism are the three worst things to haunt the modern world despite the other minor differences that divide them, and as such all factions seek to return to a more traditional and ultra-conservative platform under a supreme executive so that Mexico can be cleansed of sin, while also incorporating other varied ideas such as national conservatism, anti-populist class collaboration, Catholic theocratism, integral nationalism, Rightist communalism, and corporatist statism. Additionally, Synarchism maintains a symbiotic relationship with the Mexican Integralist movement as developed by Abascal alongside the great ‘cultural caudillo’ José Vasconcelos and Mexico’s surviving clergy and aristocracy, linking the two Far-Right political movements into one ‘Synarchointegralist’ coalition jointly aimed at saving Mexico with faith and fire while mixing ideas between the two groups - much to the chagrin of the Urquiza and his radical clique who now struggle in debate on the merits of republicanism with their new monarchist allies. Also holding tangential links to similar movements across the Catholic Right in places like Austria and Iberia through a shared adherence to the ‘Rerum novarum’ of Pope Leo XIII, Sinarquismo is the Mexican Right’s last chance to fully turn back the clock to a pious time before the Mexican Revolution."

Popularized as a natural response to Russia’s increasingly imperialist policies, the Altaians sought to distinguish themselves from the surrounding tribes and to cement their own distinct ethnic identity in the face of possible cultural annihilation by embracing the new faith en masse. Originally millenarian, charismatic, and anti-shamanic all in an attempt to completely revolutionize Altaic culture and society so that it may survive the sweeping tide of modernity, Burkhanism has adapted to drop much of these aspects, becoming more routine and more rooted in Altai’s pre-existing folk religion and shamanistic bases, while also coalescing around an institutionalized hierarchy of oral epic singers that serves as the clergy and theocratic administrative and judicial body of the faith. Overall, Burkhanist religious ideas are a syncretistic mix of varied pre-shamanist, shamanist, Tibetan Buddhist, Tengrist, and Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs, though it is not viewed as being a sub-sect of any of these larger faiths, instead being its own distinct thing largely focused on Altaic national salvation, though some forms of the faith advocate broader ideas such as unity with the Tuvans or even all of Pan-Mongolia. Controversially, Ak Jang has also been hijacked and further developed by the Kalmyk-born Mongolian warlord Dambiijanstan, aka Ja Lama, who sees himself as the prophesied reincarnation of the messianic hero Amursana while preaching a far more violent and ethno-supremacist bastardization of Ak-Jang driven by savage banditry and geared towards the total destruction of the Chinese as revenge for their past crimes against the Oirat-Altaic people of old Dzungaria and beyond, but aside from this radical off-shoot not recognized by the main high choir, the White Faith is largely centered in Altai proper while promoting far more agreeable and peaceful ideas aimed at ensuring that Altaic culture and their very way of life endures."

Headed by the Belgian-born Flemish nationalist Joris Van Severen, the movement rejects liberal capitalism on the Right and syndicalism on the Left, instead preaching a third way of sorts while taking a great deal of inspiration from the Solidarists of Russia, with the wider movement widely being Russiophilic like its founder while also pulling from the Maurasian Integralism of the Action Française. Conversely, their ideology is also vehemently Germanophobic, fearing the encroaching hegemony of the Kaiserreich and its hungry tendrils for Berlin’s reach threatens the dream of a united and self-sufficient Pan-Netherlands, though internally the group struggles over supporting Dutch and Flemish nationalism or more of a fused Belgian strain. Corporate Statists with deep ties to the Roman Catholic Church, Verdinaso may not be the only advocates for Heel-Nederlandse Gedachte, often competing with like-minded groups like the Vlaamsche Front or the Rexists, but their Russophilic tendencies set them apart from the rest."

Thus, God Knowers reject all established religions and various new age beliefs, despite their folkist allies holding them, instead advocating for a pantheistic Germanic Aryan cultural model to replace the perverted elements. The works of Mathilde Ludendorff synthesize science and philosophy, constructing a vision where the strong and pure-blooded people shall attain the immortality of their soul by unity within God, a true Nordic God that is their own race through which they perceive the Divine and prevent a 'people death.'

Inspired by romanticist traditions, the Neoconservative answer to modernist pessismism is looking towards both the past, especially the spirit of the Holy Roman Empire and its 'organic' structure, and new revolutionary vitality wielded by the youth of Germany. Settling itself between individualistic liberalism and 'degenerate' reactionary idealogues, the Young Conservatives desire to unite the nationalism of the right with the economics of the left, notably via compelling the Volk towards the vision of a utopic Third Reich. This supra-state would be led by a singular representative of the people's will, with popular participation maintained via the creation of various guilds and corporations.\n\nThis new state, especially per Moeller's definitions, would be guided by the principle of Prussianism and grant the German people an eternal destiny and community to be part of. Most notable, however, is that Moeller, and the majority of the Young Conservatives, have regarded this Volk as not defined by blood but rather by culture and history. This belief makes participation of other peoples in the idea of a German-led Empire available, one that would maintain respect for the various constituent autonomies and communities within. All of this is to be maintained, ironically, via an eternal vigil of constant motion. In the writer's own definitions, a true conservative must constantly work to keep the inherently valuable alive in changing times. The curator of preservation must create a new form to the old to ensure its survival, rather than resort to total immobility as reactionaries would or succumb to petulant destruction as pure revolutionaries do."

Supporters of agrarian parties range from large landowners or landed gentry to smallholders and poor farmers, from the lower high class through the most consistent support base among the middle class, and ending up on the lower classes. The origins of political agrarianism can be traced to the 'government of nature' developed by physiocrat and laissez-faire advocate François Quesnay, as well as the republic of rural virtue of Thomas Jefferson. While supporters of such parties hold the people of the land as a foundation of society and the most important part of the nation's organism, they differ wildly in their positions regarding economy, taxation, protectionism vs free trade, system of government, religion etc. Agrarian parties are generally conservative and traditionalist, although there is a sizeable contingent of radically liberal and downright socialistic groups, with some unconventional right-wingers mixed in-between. This wide range can be seen by looking at only a few rural movements, such as the German national revolutionary Landvolkbewegung or the conservative and monarchist Bund der Landwirte, the more centrist Czech RSZML or the Finnish Maalaisliitto, and even the radicals in terms of social changes such as Poland's PSL Wyzwolenia or Bulgaria's BZNS."

While the term 'panchayat' originated in India and usually refers to local village assemblies, the System was outlined by Prince Mahendra, son of King Tribhuvan. An ambitious young contender, the inheritor of the throne has long tired of his birthright being dominated by the powerful Rana dynasty of Prime Ministers, although that does not mean the Prince shares constitutionalist views of his father. The Panchayat System aims at reorganizing the entire Kingdom into a system of provinces, overseen by four-layers of assemblies and six classes, governed by a mass cadre of bureaucrats and officials representing party-less regime under which every decision requires the final approval of the monarch. In such way Mahendra would ensure that not only the old elite is swept away, but also that the republican radicals are rendered obsolete and driven out of the nation. The other key tenet of the Panchayat System is the elevation of the 'Three Pillars' of Nepali culture, shown in the expression 'Ek Raja, Ek Bhesh, Ek Bhasa' (One King, One Dress, One Language). The renewed power of the monarch, not seen since the days of the Father of the Nation Prithvi Narayan Shah, shall lead to a careful 'National Guidance' by the earthly representative of Vishnu, a man who wants to see the people prosper by introducing a grand land reform, industrialization, modernization of inftrastucture, improvements in education, and a modern healthcare system. While the opponents of the System deride Mahendra's vision as a chauvinistic absolutist ploy to replace the old elite with one loyal to him, the supporters of the Panchayat point out that only under Mahendra shall Nepal move past its feudal legacy and embrace a certain 'democratic' ideal in the literal sense of the word combined with a government type 'suitable to the soil' as the Prince described it."

Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century.

Madison in 1803, which in the eyes of many scholars knocked the Supreme Court of the United States off the rails of checks and balances and down the slippery slope towards judicial rule. Even seen as a form of proto Anti-Statism by some fringe Libertarian and Anarchist scholars, Kritarchies are wildly varied and hotly debated, for many academics debate and doubt the veracity of many of these examples as true kritarchies, but regardless, they can be united along with other forms of government like them in their general adherence to judicial law and legalist governance."

The greatest extent of Integrist relevance was during the founding of Partido Integrista, and while the party has mostly fallen into irrelevance, it continues as a minor current within Basque traditionalism and Carlist extremism. Theorized originally by prominent traditionalists such as Ramón Nocedal and Juan Olazábal, Integrism differs from the traditional dividing lines of Spanish traditionalism, which usually are separated by the dynastic lines, with Carlists and Alfonsists theorizing on their own variations on traditionalist thought.\n\n Integrists in turn do not have a selected monarch to support, and in the 1920s and 1930s the movement adopted accidentalism, an ambivalence to working within the frameworks of monarchy and republic alike, into their program, and as the movement has been sidelined by more mainstream traditionalists, aspects of mysticism and millenarianism have creeped into the movement, with some Integros even supporting crowning Jesus Christ as the symbolic king of Spain, to rule the nation as the end times approach due to the diabolic false gods of Syndicalism and Liberalism. In the view of Integrists, the ideal state is one made up of various natural organisms, be they trade unions, corporations or even family structures, and the state itself is merely there to ensure that this organism runs in practice.\n\n The Integrists approach all social issues from the point of view of religion, seeing poverty, inequality and regionalist issue as the creation of liberal failures to create true equality in a way that a truly Catholic society would be able to achieve. In practice, Integrists believe in a state run by those most capable and pious to do so, as their electoral successes have proven that Integrists most often prefer the opinions of experts to those of politicians, and their mistrust of politicians is equally evident in their vehement distaste for any form of democratic organization. While not particularly different from mainline Carlism in practice, its stubborn disregard for solving social issues in any way other than religious one, and fundamentalist approach to Catholicism causes even traditionalists of deep faith from other parties to find the movement dangerous and frightening, if obscure, political force."

Vibrantism as an ideology espouses a form of Catalanism, that is, Catalan nationalist and cultural movement, where the separation of Catalonia from Spain and Hispanishness in all its forms, be they monarchist, autocratic or republican, is the most important aim. The ideology is heavily influenced by Cardona’s own experiences within the Catalan nationalist movements, as during his collaboration with parties such as Estat Catala, he was often expelled for advocating for complete separation from Spain after more pragmatic actors accepted offers from Madrid for a more autonomist solutions.\n\n Vibrantism is also inherently liberal and democratic, despite its militant and nationalist roots, as Cardona saw ideologies such as Totalism and Legionarism as the state imposing itself on the individual, whereas he saw his own nationalist thoughtform as the individual imposing themselves on the state. According to Cardona, nationalism is inherently social, not political, and it respects and preserves the being of the individual, the family, the municipality, the region and the nation. To him, nationalism is the preservation of the spiritual and human content of every social element. Vibrantism is also quite fluid in its support, as it tends to aim for an apolitical, trans-classist approach, seeking support from working-class nationalists as well, evident in Nosaltres Sols’ alliance with Partit Catala Proletari. Cardona considers nationalism to be an evolutionary trait of peoples, and thus incapable of being truly crushed even in the face of imperialism or disruptive ideologies of the day. This, at times paradoxical ideology, is slowly becoming more mainstream in Catalan politics after the inclusion of Nosaltres Sols in parliamentary politics, and it may very well see new evolutions to its base formula now that separation from Spain has been achieved."

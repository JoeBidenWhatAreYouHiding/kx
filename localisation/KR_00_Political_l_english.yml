### Subtype Descriptions ###
totalist_subtype_desc:0 "The term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. Totalism is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarization, centralization, and totalitarian transformation of society."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."

natsynd_subtype:0 "National Syndicalism"
natsynd_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Syndicalism)§!\n\nOftentimes referred to as Charter Totalism or even just Totalism, National Syndicalism describes an ideology that seeks to centralize the usually decentralized Syndicalist system around a strong central executive or authoritative body while supported by Nationalist tendencies. Pioneered by the likes of Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois, and Benito Mussolini, among other signers of the Totalist Charter, this new form of authoritarian Syndicalism seeks to safeguard the Revolution through any means necessary without allowing the weak and disorganized nature of decentralized government becoming an obstacle to national progress."
authcom_subtype:0 "Communism"
authcom_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Communism)§!\n\nThe term 'Communism' is usually used to designate one of the main alternatives to orthodox French and English Syndicalism. Based on the writings and thoughts of Marx, Engels and Lenin, the ideology promotes revolution as a means of seizing power led by a vanguard party operating on the principles of democratic centralism composed of professional revolutionaries, representing both workers and peasants, who would establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, a phase of Socialism serving as a transition from the Capitalist bourgeois society to the ideal classless and stateless society: the communist society. During this phase of Socialism the means of production would be transferred from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat. The tendencies within the Leninist current may differ, but all Communists are united in their struggle for a better world for the proletariat of the whole world."
sorelianism_subtype:0 "Sorelianism"
sorelianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Sorelianism)§!\n\nComposed on the teachings and writings of French Revolutionary Georges Sorel, Sorelianism seeks the creation of a deeply centralized National Worker's State with the framework of Revolutionary Syndicalism. While seemingly highly contradictory, Sorelianism is one of the more popular forms of national syndicalism within post-Revolution Western Europe, making it's viability as a sustainable ideology quite good."
national_communism_subtype:0 "National Communism"
national_communism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Communism)§!\n\nCombining aspects of Nationalism and Patriotism with Socialist and purely Communist practices, National Communists seek to progress towards a truly Communist society - as dictated by Marx and Engels - while supported by a fervent nationalist identity. Seizing the means of production for the Proletariat while bolstering a national identity for all in the nation to adhere to and find pride in, ‘NatComs’ hold that only through the elevation of their unique national identity can true Communism be achieved, wholly distinct from commonly held ideas of Internationalism and Pan-Leftist unity. In these states, the nation and the people - and in turn their unique journey towards Communism - are distinct from the wider international Proletariat, and as such, it is these people that hold priority as their nations build up a Socialist society."
technocratic_socialism_subtype:0 "Technocratic Socialism"
technocratic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Technocratic Socialism)§!\n\nTechnocratic Socialist believe in a system where the nation's decision-making is left to an unelected ruling class of technical experts. Technocratic governments often prioritize science and scientific advancement and are opposed to reactionary and primitive systems of government"
georgian_socialism_subtype:0 "Georgian Socialism"
georgian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Georgian Socialism)§!\n\nGeorgian Socialism is a term for the fiercely nationalistic, expansionist and Anti-Russian ideology of Georgia under Chairman Ioseb B. Jughashvili and the Sakartvelos Komunisturi Partia. Georgian Socialism is an ideology unique to the Caucasus Region, and represents the people with its values of strength, self sufficiency and brotherhood."
mladorossi_subtype:0 "National-Bolshevik Monarchism"
mladorossi_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National-Bolshevik Monarchism)§!\n\nWhile Monarchism and Socialism are typically contradictory ideologies, several movements have embraced a seemingly impossible mix of Monarchism and Socialism. Movements such as the Mladorossi - who call for a form of ‘Labor Monarchy’ - are followed by many other varied Socialist regimes who have decided to keep their Monarchs around as figureheads, though some rare examples of a monarch truly invested in the Socialist system do exist. The Mladorossi themselves seek to combine ideas of Russian Monarchism with the Soviet Socialist system, fusing Bolshevik policy with Russian Nationalism and Traditionalism under the embrace of a Red Crown and Aristocracy and united by Orthodox faith."
autocratic_socialist_subtype:0 "Autocratic Socialism"
autocratic_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Autocratic Socialism)§!\n\nAutocratic Socialist regimes are highly authoritarian dictatorships that (at least on paper) adhere to socialist principles. They are notably varied, but can usually be seen with some form of command economy, emphasis on militarism, are often nationalist or use patriotism as a tool of the state, and are frequently at odds with more mainline Charter Totalists. While their commitment to Socialist revolutionary principles is usually questionable at best, these regimes still maintain socialism as the official state ideology, and go to lengths to paint their government red - even if the government is nothing short of a total dictatorship."
red_junta_subtype:0 "Red Junta"
red_junta_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Red Junta)§!\n\nMilitary Dictatorships come in many forms, including Military Dictatorships that have a significant left-lean. These regimes in particular are highly authoritarian, militaristic and stratocratic, while still maintaining Socialist principles."
caponism_subtype:0 "Mafioso Socialism"
caponism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Mafia Socialism)§!\n\nMafioso Socialism, often just called Caponism or Caponeism after its leading ‘theorist’, is the ideology ascribed to notable crime lord and pseudosocialist Alphonse Capone, who rose to political prominence within the American Socialist movement during the Civil War. Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."
juche_subtype:0 "Juche"
juche_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Juche)§!\n\nA totalitarian ideology unique to the Far East, Juche describes a syncretic variant of National Syndicalism incorporating and emphasizing ideas, practices, and motifs of Marxism, Nationalism, Militarism, Autarkism, and even Monarchism. Claiming that only through total self-sufficiency and with total devotion to the one Supreme Leader can the nation truly achieve real Socialism, and eventually, utopia. Harsh towards any form of Liberalism, Counter-Revolutionary action, or any other ideas deemed an obstacle to the state, only through total loyalty to the Party and to the Supreme Leader can one reap the benefits of the state, and all those who fail in these duties are branded enemies of the state without remorse."
nazbol_subtype:0 "National-Bolshevism"
nazbol_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National-Bolshevism)§!\n\nNational Bolshevism is a similar ideology to mainline Totalism, but instead of aiming for a Syndicalist system built entirely around unions, it instead adheres to the Bolshevik system espoused by the Soviets during the Russian Civil War and beyond. Combining Nationalism with Marxist-Leninism to varying degrees, these syncretic Socialist believe that only through patriotism, national fervor, a planned and nationalized economy, and adherence to the ideas of Marx can true Communism be achieved."
obammunism_subtype:0 "Obamaism"
obammunism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Obamaism)§!\n\nObamaism, sometimes called Obama Thought, Spiritual Pan-Africanism, Maumauism, or even ‘Obamunism’, describes the specific form of Pan-Africanism pioneered by Onyango Obama of the Mau-Mau. Combining the esoteric spiritual beliefs of the Mau-Mau group that raises Obama as the physical manifestation of their patron deity the ‘Ghost Goat’ with occultist practices, witchcraft, shamanism, Socialist Pan-Africanism, and Pan-African Nationalism, this syncretic ideology is unique in its outlook on the traditional Pan-African cause. Calling for cooperation and unity between all peoples of African under a totalitarian but benevolent Socialist hereditary theocracy under the prophet Obama that is backed by a strong volunteer and fanatically devoted military and supported by an economy vaguely resembling autarkic Agrarian National Syndicalism mixed with traditional tribalist practices, Obamaism is a ideology that could only be forged in the melting pot of chaos and extremism that is colonial Africa."
germanic_socialism_subtype:0 "Germanic Socialism"
germanic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Germanic Socialism)§!\n\nThe term 'Germanic Socialism' refers to the ideology unique to Germany theorized by Paul Lensch and his political party the GSVP. Drawing on the writings of Oswald Spengler, Volkist theses and the policies of the Iron Chancellor Bismarck and of the Soldier-King Frederick William I while rejecting classical Marxist and socialist theories, this ideology places Germany as a unique nation in the world, a symbol of the Proletariat fighting against bourgeois nations such as France and Britain. Germanic Socialism therefore promotes the unity of the German people within a single Pan-Germanic state, united by the central figure of the 'Volkskanzler', guardian of the Germanic Tradition and of the People's Empire. The economy of the German Socialist state is organized in a corporatist manner, with national industries and private enterprises working hand in hand. The atypical positions of Germanic Socialism have led to its condemnation as reactionary and pseudo-socialist by the vast majority of the world's socialist movements, although it has found some adherents among both the upper and lower classes in Germany."
left_eurasianism_subtype:0 "Left Eurasianism"
left_eurasianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Eurasianism)§!\n\nBased on a philosophical and political thought of Nikolai Trubetskoy and Peter Savitsky, Left Eurasianism has been radicalized and tied together with traditional Russian popular socialism and Narodism. Criticizing the Orthodox Eurasianism for its reactionary conservatism, the Left Eurasianism emphasizes a revolutionary all-Eurasian movement and liberation of all Eurasian peoples under rule of a socialist party."
jacobinism_subtype:0 "Jacobinism"
jacobinism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Jacobinism)§!\n\nBorrowing its name from the 'Society of the Jacobins, Friends of Freedom and Equality', Jacobinism is an authoritarian socialist ideology developed by camarade Maurice Thorez. Drawing from the policies instituted by Maximilien Robespierre as well as the writings of Vladimir Lenin, Jacobinism seeks to create a truly revolutionary regime, seeing violent social action as the core of the French spirit. Followers of Thorez are ready to strike down any agent they deem as anti-socialist, be they reactionaries or false socialists, in their pursuit of 'Communism with French Characteristics'."
esoteric_leninism_subtype:0 "Esoteric Leninism"
esoteric_leninism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Esoteric Leninism)§!\n\nSeeking to fuse Marxist-Leninism with any number of outside concepts, Esoteric Leninism is an ill-defined and largely variable offshoot of mainline Socialist thought. From Theology or Theosophy to Occultism and Shamanism, what is grafted to Socialist thought can differ greatly, but what they share is a common Leftist foundation and a dedication to the words, or at least the image, of Marx."
tot_afrofuture_subtype:0 "Afrofuturism"
tot_afrofuture_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Afrofuturism)§!\n\nAfrofuturism is a newly created thoughtform advocating for Pan-Africanism, African Nationalism, and Populism for the African people while advancing towards a Futurist cultural revolution, though what it defines as ‘African’ varies greatly. Linked to various other ideological movements from National Syndicalism to Black Supremacism to Afrocentric Pacifism, what it means to be African in the Afrofuture can vary, but being declared a true African in any Afrofuturist society grants all the populist benefits such a title could bring. Usually radical and fiercely devoted to its Pan-African and Futurist goals bordering on millenarianism or zealotry, these groups will stop at nothing to achieve the Afrofuture."
left_townerism_subtype:0 "Left-Townerism"
left_townerism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left-Townerism)§!\n\nTaking Towner’s ideology and injecting it with ideas of National Syndicalism and Esoteric Nationalism, Dixonism is the brainchild of Chief New Moon, the disciple of Elwood Towner. Far more militarist and extremist than Townerism, Dixonism calls for the outright massacre or imprisonment of all non-Native souls in North America while promising a red-tinted National ‘Socialist’ utopia for all true Red Men."
popcom_subtype:0 "Popular Communism"
popcom_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Popular Communism)§!\n\nPopular Communism, nicknamed ‘Apple-Pie Communism’ or just Browderism by its loyal adherents in the Americas, is a form of centralized, semi-Authoritarian Socialism that features a strong executive while also working to build a united Left front in order to foster Pan-Leftist unity and cooperation. A mix of Authoritarianism and pure Socialist Democracy, Popular Communism seeks to safeguard the Revolution without resorting to infighting, excess violence, brutal repressions and reprisals, and other inhumane practices. Supported by craft unions and guilds but against communization and Anarchist-influenced cooperatives, Popular Communism centralizes the economy and the state in sound hands while still allowing self-management and autonomous freedoms for the working class, and usually seeks to find a balance between Agrarian and Industrialist pursuits."
tot_left_panafricanism_subtype:0 "Left Pan-Africanism"
tot_left_panafricanism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Pan-Africanism)§!\n\nLeft Pan-Africanism, sometimes penned as Pan-Afrikanism, Panafrikanism, or Panafrianism, describes a diverse group of ideas and movements all centered around the idea of Pan-African unity. Oftentimes including the African Diaspora as well as just the African continent, this usually Nationalist and varyingly Socialist ideology usually seeks to promote either total political and even cultural unity between African groups under an array of Leftist ideas, or just cooperation and comradery between ethnonationalist sects each promoting their unique identities in their own Socialist states. Though not inherently, Left Pan-Africanism is frequently militaristic, and each particular strain’s dedication to the wider World Revolution or other Leftist goals outside Africa is varied, but not all are so solely concerned on African-only affairs. Widespread across much of Africa and the wider Black Diaspora, it has been pioneered by figures such as Onyango Obama, Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, and many others, and is one of the fastest growing new ideologies on Earth."
tot_authentice_subtype:0 "Authenticité"
tot_authentice_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Authenticité)§!\n\nAuthenticité, sometimes called Nzereianization or Nzereism, is the state ideology of Nzere as crafted and personally described by Bobozo Sese Seko. Pan-African in nature, calling for the cooperation between ethnonationalist African groups without political unity, Authenticité calls for a ‘return to authenticity’ as the name suggests. This return is characterized by Congolese Nationalism, a revival of African aesthetics and identity, the total rejection of anything European or ‘Western’, Corporatism, and ethnically-tied Socialism for its loyal African proletariat."
hoxhaism_subtype:0 "Hoxhaism"
hoxhaism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Hoxhaism)§!\n\nHoxhaism, sometimes called Albanian Leninism, is the ideology championed by Enver Hoxha, the young leader of the vanguardist faction of the Revolutionary National Committee. Hoxha's ideology slowly developed throughout the years he spent in Paris and also traveling around the various headquarters of European socialist parties. With time he came to believe that Anarchists, Syndicalists, Sorelians, Jacobins and Charterites are nothing but traitors to the revolutionary struggle, one which Vladimir Lenin was the greatest champion of. Thus, Hoxhaists' main goal is the preservation of V.I. Lenin's legacy and creation of the most scientific and anti-revisionist form of Marxism-Leninism. They also combine that with a fierce drive to transform Albania into a truly communist country, reforge its culture from a reactionary mess of contradictions into a proud socialist-patriotic tradition. Furthermore, followers of Hoxha will not rest until any and all forms of revisionism and right-leaning traitors inside and outside the party are dealt with."
ultra_hoxhaism_subtype:0 "Ultra-Hoxhaism"
ultra_hoxhaism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Ultra-Hoxhaism)§!\n\nBorn after the tragic death of Albania's late supreme leader, Ultra-Hoxhaism or Enverism-Nexhmijeism is the product of the sorrow and rage of Hoxha's widow Nexhmije. Ultra-Hoxhaism view life after death of Enver as an eternal struggle against revisionists, resulting in the creation of an all-reaching totalitarian state that sees endless purification of the socialist society as the only answer after Enver's murder. Nexhmijeists will not rest until every traitor, not just in Albania but across the entire world, is punished for trying to shatter Hoxha's grand dream. A socialist paradise towards which Ultra-Hoxhaism strides ever so boldly."
tot_paneuropeanism_subtype:0 "Left Paneuropeanism"
tot_paneuropeanism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Paneuropeanism)§!\n\nPaneuropeanism, in its broadest sense, describes any ideology pushing towards total European unification. From the traditionalist and aristocratic but liberal and progressive ideas of Kalergi to the hypernationalist, esoteric, and anti-modern rhetoric of Evola, this ideology comes in many variations and breeds. For Left Paneuropeanists, the idea of a unified continent serves as the final goal in liberation of the entire proletariat. Some also tie it together with the vision of a new socialist man, working tirelessly to create a workers' utopia while others see United Europe as only a stepping stone for the World Revolution. Ultimately, though, most are content with liberating just one continent."

totalist_savinkovism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Revolutionary Savinkovism)§!\n\nRevolutionary Savinkovism - Taking the syncretic nature of baseline Savinkovism to new heights, Revolutionary, or Left, Savinkovism is the final evolution of Boris Savinkov’s political odyssey. Combining views gathered from his time in both the Left and Right wings of radical Russian politics, Left Savinkovism is highly Nationalist, Militarist, and Totalitarian while pushing for total, yet open, Russification of the state like its predecessor, but supported by the Socialist economic policies of the Left SRs and the Chekists as opposed to Rightist Corporatism. Dyed Red and under a crimson banner born anew, Revolutionary Savinkovism seeks to bring utopia to the true children of Rus while annihilating any of those foolish enough to stand in the way."

commie_elfism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Marxism-Careyism)§!\n\nMarxism-Leninism-Careyism, also known as Marxism-Leninism-Careyist Thought or simply Elven Communism is the predominate leftist ideology of the various radical pro-labor groups in the North Pole. Calling for a Vanguard Party to led the 'Elfletariat' in the revolutionary struggle against the Theocratic-Monarchist-Feudal regime of Santa, Careyism differs from other forms of Marxism in that no others can led the world revolution but the Elven workers of Santa. Holding them as the most fair and developed of all working classes, Careyists hold distain against all other forms of Leftism, viewing them as up holders of a racist and unpure form of Revolutionary thought."

heat_miserism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Heat Miserism)§!\n\nBased on the simple premise of bringing about an age of heat, Heat Miserism is a new ideology to the workshop. While having little other to it than the aforementioned age of heat, Heat Miserism and it's adherents will do anything and everything to bring the world to it's knees, and restoring the true order of things. Despite sharing a name, and despite both of the Misers being brothers, Miserism as a whole shares but one similarity, a deep and burning hatred of the 50 degree range, agreeing that it must be eradicated at all costs."
fitzhughism_subtype:0 "Fitzhughism"
fitzhughism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Fitzhughism)§!\n\nFitzhughism, named after its chief and only real theorist George Fitzhugh, is a form of highly unorthodox pseudo-Socialism that revolves around the idea that race-blind chattel slavery, the rejection of wages and Capitalism, and staunch anti-Liberalism are the surest ways towards true Socialism and a free society. Largely forgotten about for decades as Fitzhugh drifted into obscurity, the ideology was recently revived and popularized by George W. Christians. Seeing Fitzhughism as such a pure strain of Socialism that it makes the Communards ‘look yellow’ in comparison, Christians seeks to combine Fitzhugh’s original ideas with his own positions of anti-Catholicism and uncompromising pragmatism to create a truly new and bizarre form of Leftist thought reviled by most of the Internationale but exceedingly popular with a growing group of fanatical followers and disillusioned radicals in America’s heartland."
social_futurism_subtype:0 "Social-Futurism"
social_futurism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Social-Futurism)§!\n\nPioneered by the major figures of the earlier Cubo-Futurist and Ego-Futurist movements of Russia, and influenced by the Italian Futurists like Marinetti that rose before them, Social Futurism represents the new wave of Leftist-inspired Futurist thought that fuses Socialist ideology with this rising cultural phenomena. Stepping away from the frequently-Right Wing thoughtform, Social Futurists such as Vladimir Mayakovsky, Natalia Goncharova, and Velimir Khlebnikov instead infuse both Utopian and Scientific Socialist ideas in order to blaze a pathway towards a new, Red-tinted vision for the future. In a Social Futurist system, the masses - frequently under the direction of a central government, technocratic council, or artistic vanguard - will work to erect a utopian society that endlessly marches forward to progress towards a modernized, urbanized Socialist future atop a speeding Red wave of ever-evolving theory, policy, art, and more."
militant_atheism_subtype:0 "Militant Atheism"
militant_atheism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Militant Atheism)§!\n\nSeeing religion exactly how Marx once described, Militant Atheism seeks to fully eradicate the Opiate of the Masses in all forms, severing the final chain that shackles the Proletariat to the failures of the past. The specific form of Leftist ideology Militant Atheists adhere to can vary greatly, though it is usually tied to some variation of authoritarian and highly militarized forms of Socialism. However, what all of these groups share is a fierce devotion to freeing humanity from religion and spirituality in all forms as they replace it with civic dogma to the Party or the State."
technocracy_subtype:0 "Technocracy"
technocracy_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Technocracy)§!\n\nTechnocracy is a form of government in which the decision-makers are selected on their basis in a given area of responsibility, particularly with regard to scientific or technical knowledge. Advocating for ideas such as ‘energy-accounting’ and the total acceleration of society and culture towards a new, efficient, and rationally-developed mindset supported by political systems free of bipartisan politics and factionalism, Technocracy is a vaguely Left-wing ideology, though technocratic ideas are common in different ideologies across the spectrum. Seeing Capitalism as wasteful and traditional Socialism as inefficient, Technocracy seeks to break the mold as it leads humanity towards an enlightened utopia."
maximato_subtype:0 "Maximato"
maximato_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Maximato)§!\n\nThe term Maximato refers less to a structured ideology and more to the pseudo-socialist politics and changing thinking of the political chameleon Plutarco Elias Calles. Calles advocates the violent centralization of the state, with the powers in the hands of a single man 'El Jefe' around whom a strong cult of personality reigns and against whom no opposition is allowed. Under the Maximato, an extremist and very violent atheism is practiced, with religious people and institutions strongly persecuted and discriminated against, and with an economy completely under state control. In terms of foreign policy, the Maximist state is proudly isolationist, declaring its ability to sustain itself without any foreign aid."

tot_developing_leftism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Developing Socialism)§!\n\nDeveloping Socialism, also sometimes called Tribal Leftism or Indigenous Proto-Socialism, describes traditionalist and non-modern societies that have only recently come to understand and embrace the basics of Socialist theory, and have started a concerted effort in trying to achieve the Proletarian Dream. Oftentimes influenced by outside sources, forces, or figures that bring these foreign ideas to these societies, Developing Socialists do not adhere to any one brand of Leftist rhetoric, and frequently incorporate greatly varied ideas in order to build the foundations of a Leftist or pseduo-Leftist ideology formfit to their specific realities, cultures, and traditions. Though Developing Socialism can merely be an intermediary step on the road to ‘true’ Socialism, it can also be the end-all and be-all goal for traditionalist groups merely seeking to make their own societies more prosperous and equal, or for outsiders to continue their ideological experiments."

Based on the assumption that the Third International was never fully committed to the colonial problem, Richytskyism attempts to create an anti-colonial network with a focus on 'Third World' struggles against colonialism. Borrowing much from Marxism and the experience of Leninist Russia, Richytskyism aims to build a state for the workers and peasants and the global liberation of the working masses from exploitative oppression."

In this new form of Leftist society form-fit for life on the Steppe, the Red Khan - the vaguely Socialist spiritual heir to the Great Khan Temüjin and new avatar of the God of Tengrism, rising to take the old place of Chinggis as embodiment of Tengri and mortal God of Mongolia - stands as the sole authority, loosely guiding the Mongolian people along the path of traditionalist Mongolian Nomadism and Pastoralism while keeping society at peace and in check with his roving horde of veteran horselords and bandits turned stewards of the ‘state’. This authoritative balancing force functions as the sole military and police force of this new Mongolia, and is paired with an Anarchist-inspired civilian government headed by a Crimson Khuraldai that oversees the creation, organization, and operation of the disparate nomadic clans, cooperatives, collectives, and communes that ever-expand and ever-shift across the resurgent Mongol Empire. Finishing the trinity of loose government over this anti-Statist web of mobile yurt-cities and temporary settlements is a spiritual administration, headed by the Bogdo Lama and the surviving clergy, preaching a new syncretic mixture of Buddhism, Tengrism, and traditional Mongol Shamanism in order to unite the Pan-Mongolic peoples and heal from the atheist purges of MAN. Under the Red Khan, a new Socialist form of the old Mongol Empire shall attempt to rekindle the glories of the past while fusing practices like Militant Paternalism and staunch Mongolian religious Traditionalism with ideas of pseudo-Anarchist Pastoralism, spiritual syncretism, Pan-Mongolic nationalism, and nomadic communalism in order to bring egalitarian anarcho-arcadian pastoral paradise guarded by the bow and steed to all true children of the Great Chinggis Khan."

Though the pathways to achieve and uphold these Three Pillars can change drastically based on the specific interpretation one comes to after digesting the late Sun Yat-sen’s works and ideas, all emulations of Tridemism seek to bring greater honor and glory to China, greater prosperity and freedom to the Chinese people, and a greater union between all aspects of Chinese society as the Three Pillars guide China to their modern and utopian destiny."

Abandoning the Anglophilic attitudes of his original thoughtform, this new wave of Lovecraftism emphasizes culture over racial differences, and seeks to create a universal cosmic identity for all of Humanity to share that incorporates and emphasizes the best aspects of all constituent identities. Taking this new cultural synthesis, this Leftist ideology combines the esoteric ideas and beliefs of the Lovecraftian Cosmicist mythos with Left populism, welfare economics, communalism, technocracy, and anti-democratic principles along with an unwavering commitment to ignoring compromise in order to achieve the perfect progressive reformation without revolution. An odd ideology created by an even odder man, Left Lovecraftism is as hard to thoroughly define as it is to thoroughly understand its erratic creator."

Hailing from a decisively right-wing ideology, Revolutionary Ustaše is championed by the mysterious Croat politician Ante Ciliga. Revolutionary Ustaše is decidedly communistic at its core, adapting the Ustaše principles of 'Borba' and Greater Croatia to a scheme of autonomous national republics, uniquely developed from Danubian thought. These principles place the Revolutionary Ustaše in an anti-Pavelić position.\n Also devoutedly pro-Third Internationale, Revolutionary Ustaše supporters are frequently compared to Oswald Mosley in London. Even stranger still, supporters are not averse to working with the Habsburgs, Italians, and Germans residing in their ruled lands; rather, unity is on class rather than Croathood.

Formed in reaction to the bastardized form of Mexica and Nahua nationalism espoused by the ARM, this radical movement seeks to marry the restored Aztec identity and modern ideas of Mexican and Chicano nationalism with the ideas of the Mexican Revolution, bringing Socialist Agrarianism, Revolutionary Democracy, and true egalitarianism to all in Mexico supported by our long-dead religion and Mesoamerican identity. Led by the Aztec Triple Alliance Elite and raising the widely-beloved Frida Kahlo above them as unifying figure to serve as the Head of State, Mexicayotlism at first glance almost seems monarchical, with Kahlo being given monikers and titles of former Aztec rulers and deities by the people and the government.

Additionally, Lovestonists deny the entryism and exclusionary or vanguard policies of rivals like Foster, instead hoping to create a broad coalition of like-minded Communists and other Leftists sharing ideas and willing to cooperate while including the masses as much as possible to create a stable and united labor front to bring Communist freedom to the American people at large."

Calling for cooperation and unity between all peoples of the greater Kenyan highlands and wider East Africa as opposed to forcing the entire continent under its banner, Moderate Obamaism breaks from the totalitarian nature of traditional Obamaism, taking notes from the established Socialist powers of the Internationale and replacing it with a series of openly democratic localized communes under the banner of the central party, while also keeping the benevolent Socialist hereditary theocracy under the late Mzee Obama’s young children, with Kimathi serving as a form of regent that is backed by a strong and fanatically devoted volunteer military and supported by an economy vaguely resembling triablist and Anglo-inspired African National Syndicalism."

Putting forth that the only tax should be on land value, for taxing the economic rent only leads to inefficiencies and exploitation, Georgism is primarily concerned with economics, but has since been tied to ideas ranging from Syndicalism to Democratic Socialism to even certain strains of Anarchism.

Additionally, followers of Liberal Sandismo still strive to unify the 'Indo-Hispanic race' into an entity known as the 'Indo-Latin American Continental and Antillean Federation', but are far less concerned with this ideal than mainline Sandinistas, and are willing to compromise on this dream, often seeking diplomatic means of promoting Indo-Hispanic unity over conflict and armed revolution. Various forms of spiritism are also championed as a way to replace the oppressive clerical systems with a shared belief in justice and love for all people, but Liberal Sandinismo is more rooted in normal Christian and Indigenous faiths over theoretical syncretic faiths and the ideas of academic spiritualists due to its closer connections with the poor masses."

Still poised at forging a united and cohesive ‘Belgian’ identity from the disparate French and Dutch halves that are the Walloons and Flemish, Reformed Belgicism seeks to divorce Degrelle’s failed ideas of violence and anti-democratic authoritarianism from ideas of Belgian Nationalism while providing for all Belgian citizens in one way or another. Not innately tied to a specific ideological current, Reformist Belgicism is primarily concerned with reducing the political autonomy of the constituent halves of its union while promoting national syncretism and bilingualism, though oftentimes each individual movement will heavily favor either French or Dutch for ease or out of personal bias. Reformist Beglcisits are frequently paired with ideas of Roman Catholic piety, Social Catholicism or non-Revolutionary Socialist Welfare, Belgian Unitarianism, and the cultivation of a uniquely Belgian culture and identity, but the idea of a Belgian nationality is not inherently tied to any one political group, with ideas of Belgian statehood and cultural cohesion stretching far across the ideological and political spectrums of the Low Countries, from the Reformed and Humanitarian Rexists of Hergé to the Humanist Capitalists of Buisseret and the Socialist Belgicists of Dehousse."

Though not inherently, Right Pan-Africanism is frequently militaristic and sometimes even monarchist when not a national dictatorship, a junta, or a republic, and is commonly either corporatist, capitalist, or traditionalist in its economic goals with varying degrees of authoritarianism, though some democratic do exist. Widespread across much of Africa and the wider Black Diaspora, it has been pioneered by figures such as Marcus Garvey, Stanley Mathenge, Nnamdi Azikiwe, and many others, and is one of the fastest growing new ideologies on Earth."

Deeply rooted in organizations such as the Francophonic Parti Rexiste and the Dutch-speaking Verbond van Dietsche Nationaal-Solidaristen, or Verdinaso, Beglcisits are frequently paired with ideas of Roman Catholic Corporatism, Conservative Nationalism, Militarism, and strict Authoritarianism, but the idea of a Belgian nationality is not inherently reactionary, with ideas of Belgian statehood and cultural cohesion stretching far across the ideological and political spectrums of the Low Countries, though it still largely exists as a fixture of the ‘Belgian’ Far-Right."

These Hellenic Germans would be the most handsome of young men who would rule German-Bohemia and uphold its male bonding.\nReportedly homoeroticist in nature, the Wandervogel idolizes the luster and brilliance of men and their bodies, and forbids women from having any sort of power or position in the paternal Wandervogel. Besides the vast prevalence of homosexuality and open Völkisch tendencies, the Wandervogel, like many other Austro-German nationalist groups, have embraced corporatism to be entwined into societal fabrics.\nThe Wandervogel seeks a German-Bohemian male renaissance and resurgence, and nature's triumphant return into the regular lives of Hellenic Germans. Through folk song, tale, and poetry, German-Bohemia shall be born anew in a new Hellenic age."

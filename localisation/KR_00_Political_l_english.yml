kr.political.26.d:0 "Open up your country screen (click your flag in the top left or press the 'Q' key), then click the guide gui button below your leader's portrait (where the Chinese Factions button used to be). If your nation has any guides made for it, click the binoculars button and an event will fire showing you all the guides for your nation."
kr.political.26.a:0 "Woah! Now I won't have to ask how to get the country path I want! Thanks KX Team!"

kr.political.27.t:0 "The 'Optimization Button'"
kr.political.27.d:0 "While we strive to make KaiserreduX an experience as seamless and pleasant as it may be there are, unfortunately, certain engine limitations which make it impossible to make the game simply 'go faster' to a noticeable degree. However, the debug mode of Hearts of Iron IV enables by default debug smoothing, which does improve the performance of the game by forcing the engine to cease smoothing the frames during rendering. Although there is no script to enable it, we can direct you to open the console by pressing the ~ (tilde key) so you can type in debug_smooth yourself.\n\n§RBe warned, disabling smoothing is not a mere performance boost, it's forcing the game to behave how it was not intended outside of the debug mode. This may and will result in increased instability, possibly causing unexpected bugs or even crashes. If you do go through with it understand that you are taking the responsibility for what may happen with your playthrough, and that you should not report any bugs unless you can verify they also occur without debug_smooth being on.§!"
kr.political.27.a:0 "Understood and noted."

### Subtype Descriptions ###
totalist_subtype_desc:0 "The term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. Totalism is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarization, centralization, and totalitarian transformation of society."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a pluralist form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenets of market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."

natsynd_subtype:0 "National Syndicalism"
natsynd_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Syndicalism)§!\n\nWidely known as National Syndicalism, often also as Social Nationalism, Charter Totalism, no-adjective Totalism or even Charterism is the world's newest, but also the fastest growing, leading ideology on the authoritarian end of the leftist spectrum. Tracing its roots as far back as to the writings of the highly influential Revolutionary Syndicalist Georges Sorel, and then later developed by many Interventionist Socialist movements such as the Italian 'Leagues of Revolutionary Action', National Syndicalism aims to reform society to the extent which has never been attempted or done before by any regime, government nor even religion. This, according to its proponents, can only be achieved by the mobilization of a truly mass movement of workers, one that shall be a true vanguard of the revolution and reject the delusions of the vanguardist party which has brought the failed revolutionary Lenin to the dustbin of history. Such a force shall overthrow the corrupt and decadent order, of liberalism, bourgeoisie and aristocracy, and usher in the total transformation of many a 'plutocratic' nations into true Proletarian Nations, emboldened in their productive, morally vigorous character thus aimed towards grander purposes through maximum cohesion, concentration of forces, iron discipline and utter ruthlessness. Economically, the ideals of National Syndicalism will unite economic classes into a program of national development and growth, enabled by the socialization of the economy and either united national character of various trade unions or one over-union serving the state. The Class War cannot unify the nation, and thus shall be replaced by Class Rejuvenation combining the forces of the lower and increasingly drawn towards Totalism middle class, together with unifying Imperialism yet combined with the Brotherhood of Nations, adhering to and respecting the Charter. Ultimately, the ideology which has been codified in the 'Totalist Charter' mainly drafted by Benito Mussolini, Italy's 'Dux Bellorum' who has galvanized the Socialists towards the First War; former British Conservative, visionary noble and founder of the Maximist group Oswald Mosley; and the intellectual of the Sorelians within the CGT Georges Valois, is often modified and unique to the specific character of the nation in which it is implemented, molded by the absolute and charismatic guidance of the Chairman."
authcom_subtype:0 "Communism"
authcom_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Communism)§!\n\nCommunism as a term has come to designate many varied ideological positions seeking to present an alternative to the dominant Anglo-French Syndicalist orthodoxy. While the term itself dates back to the 18th century, the vast majority of modern movements utilizing that mantle can trace its origins to the works and philosophy of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Although suffering a devastating blow following the failed Bolshevik Revolution, parties which subscribe to the Marxist, or sometimes even Leninist, tendency managed to integrate into the Communard and Unionist structures, becoming important players in the world of Socialist politics. The main tenets of Communist parties can be recognized in policies such as the rejection of utopianism, class conflict, dialectical materialism, seizure and redistribution of the means of production and the establishment of a temporary ‘Socialist’ state as a stepping stone towards the equal and classless vision of Communism. Although some parties may hold additional tenets, such as Vanguard leadership, the factional width present between Orthodox Marxists, National Communists, Leninists, Anarcho-Communists and Councilists guarantees that vital differences will always be present. Nonetheless, these disparate forces can all agree that the Capitalist age is coming to an end, and it is only a matter of time before the Proletariat of the entire world will unite to throw off its shackles."
sorelianism_subtype:0 "Sorelianism"
sorelianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Sorelianism)§!\n\nModern Sorelianism, while obviously having its core in the ideas proposed by the highly influential French political philosopher Georges Sorel, has been carried forwards into the Communard reality by the intellectual duo of Georges Valois and Édouard Berth. Sorelianism at first was born out of the revision and rejection of orthodox Marxism, for 'Socialism has died' due to the 'Decomposition of Marx'. Thus Sorel expanded on the theories of the French Anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, another monumental influence on Valois and Berth who founded the 'Cercle Proudhon', advocating that through direct action against the bourgeois enemy and the 'myth' of the general strike as expressed in Revolutionary Syndicalism shall the working class attain better living conditions. Yet the 'productive energy' of the bourgeois class, put into slumber due to the degenerating influence of the greatest evil which ever manifested in France, that being liberal democracy, will once again wake after the class war rejuvenates both the autonomous proletariat and the newly productive bourgeoisie. The disdain towards parliamentary democracy and secularist spirit can even be seen in Sorelians' support for Classicism in art. While the rejection of democracy led some Sorelians to support a revolutionary monarchy, especially those that originated from AF like Valois himself, such views were mostly dropped after the establishment of the Commune. Another important concept in Sorelianism is the exaltation of the warrior-individual, manifestation of true freedom when combined with devotion to the family, the weak and labour ethic. In a fully realized Sorelian society as expanded on by Valois such a group would serve as the ruling class, somewhere above the ordinary proletariat. The modern Sorelian duo continue to follow the core tenets of Sorel while introducing many elements unique to their thinking, such as Maurrassian Integral Nationalist influences carried from their days in Action Française, rabid Anti-Semitism, Berthian synthesis between Marxian materialism and Bergsonian metaphysics, creation of the Estates General of French Production and introduction of stable gold-backed currency as outlined by Valois' long-time collaborator Jacques Arthuys, slightly increased centralization compared to Sorel's original vision and the mixing of revolutionary syndicalism and corporatism. Sorelianism, despite being a distinct movement, laid the foundations for the eventual development of National Syndicalism into the wider Totalist Charter."
national_communism_subtype:0 "National Communism"
national_communism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Communism)§!\n\nWhile sometimes confused with movements that are rabidly nationalist, intentionally so by enemies of the tendency, the simplest definition of National Communism would be the desire to implement Marxist Communism or other forms of Socialism in accordance and respect to the local realities. The proponents of such a method reject the entirely stateless internationalist vision and once again turn towards the oft ignored 'National Question', pondering with renewed energy how to combine their ideology with the preservation or restoration of particular aspects of their native culture. The origins of National Communism can be found among the various minority activists within the Bolshevik movement, such as Ukraine's Vasyl Shakhrai, Tatarstan's Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev and Crimea's Ismail Firdevs, who became disillusioned with the continuation of cultural chauvinism so ever-present during the oppressive imperial era. Another important voice in the melding of national interests with communism, unrelated to the groups which operated within the Russian Communist Party, is the Borotbist movement led by Alexander Shumsky. National Communists carry the torch of Marx while noting that his position of workers having 'no country' refers to the globalized bourgeoisie states, machines for exploitation against which the policy of full independence or wide national autonomy in cooperation with new Socialist cores ought to be employed. For true Socialism, touching upon every aspect of local tradition, cannot be achieved unless the 'colonized' groups break the chains of their metropolitan masters. While to many Communists every National Communist represents a certain 'national deviation', the tendency itself does not merge its goals with explicit nationalism represented by the usual meaning of such a term. That is not to say certain groups do not increase their reliance on the 'national' part of their ideology. The National Communist term has also been applied to Marxist thinkers which do advocate an alliance with rabidly nationalistic and chauvinistic groups inside their nations, much to the chagrin of conventional representative of the ideology who call such positions 'Social-Reactionism', the most famous of them being the German Communist Heinrich Laufenberg, who developed the idea described by him as 'National Bolshevism'."
technocratic_socialism_subtype:0 "Technocratic Socialism"
technocratic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Technocratic Socialism)§!\n\nWhile the basic understanding of Technocratic Socialism, often confused with the Technocratic movement despite being two distinct entities with differing origins, could lead some to think it's a mere combination of technological advancement with socialist policies such a view would be particularly limited. For the technocratic tendency within Socialism is often born out of the very material understanding of the world through the use of the political ideology, although some say pure science of Marx, developed by the Father of Communism and further expanded upon by a diverse group of thinkers. The most important of the groups fitting such a descriptor is the Bolshevik 'Proletkult', the 'Proletarian Culture' movement having its origins in the ideological Vpered, or 'Forward', faction of their party. Led by the coalition of Anatoly Lunacharsky, a close friend of V.I. Lenin and the People's Commissar of Education during the Revolution, Alexander Bogdanov, one of Lenin's greatest rivals for a time and the man around whom the original Vpered coalesced, and Valerian Polyansky, editor-in-chief of proletarian literature and progenitor of Soviet censorship. The main principle of the Proletkult is their devotion to progress and ardent 'religious' belief in the collective society and Scientific Socialism, a construct which gave birth to the Proletarian Religion and the 'God-Building' principle. Based on the Auguste Comte's 'Religion of Humanity' the Proletkultists deify the Socialist Enlightenment given form as a new faith, one capable of replacing the corrupt old lore of the dying bourgeoisie world, a plane in which even immorality may be achieved according to A. Bogdanov and his experiments with blood transfusion. Another important thinker of the Proletkult, although distinct from the Lunacharsky group, is Aleksei Gastev. Proponent of a Syndicalist-Technocratic Soviet system breaking with the orthodox Leninist tradition, Gastev is the creator of the 'Ustanovka' concept, aiming to install a revolutionary mental attitude within Russia through the use of social engineering and scientific management drawing upon the works of Frederick Taylor. With the great mission of labour overseen by a technically minded avant-garde the proletariat shall move time itself forward."
georgian_socialism_subtype:0 "Georgian Socialism"
georgian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Georgian Socialism)§!\n\nGeorgian Socialism could be understood as an adaptation of Leninist Bolshevism to the context of a reborn Georgia, according to National Communistic principles. Such a break with Leninist orthodoxy is the brainchild of Ioseb 'Koba' Jughashvili, a former fighter in the Russian Revolution who escaped to his native Georgia in the aftermath of the White victory in the Civil War. While Georgian Socialism upholds elements shared by many Communist parties claiming the legacy of the Revolution, such as a focus on class warfare, party's doctrinal purity, wealth redistribution, rapid industrialization, and rural collectivization, the differentiating parts make it distinct from other exiles such as mainstream Zinovievites. For Koba's socialism is an ideology rabidly anti-Russian, vowing to never again let his homeland be at the whim of the Muscovite chauvinists. To that extent a massive campaign for the rebirth of Georgian culture must be undertaken, so that the natives of Koba's domain can have the strength to oppose the foreign oppressors. Another key point in Georgian Socialism is the total control of the state and the ultimate devotion of the people towards it, as represented and hinged upon the figure of Chairman Jugashvili, viewed as the incarnate form of his Sakartvelo. Lastly, Georgian Socialists posit a program of unification of the native ethnoses of Caucasus, bound together by their inner strength developed through the centuries spent combating the Russo-Turkish imperialists. While some foreign observers point out similarities between Ioseb Jughashvili's movement and the emerging 'Totalist Charter' such comparisons are quickly shot down by the devout adherents of the Georgian ideology, still claiming that theirs is a genuine adaptation of true Marxist principles.

mladorossi_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Social Monarchism)§!\n\nWhile Monarchism and Socialism are typically contradictory ideologies, several movements have embraced a seemingly impossible mix of Monarchism and Socialism. Movements such as the Mladorossi - who call for a form of ‘Labor Monarchy’ - are followed by many other varied Socialist regimes who have decided to keep their Monarchs around as figureheads, though some rare examples of a monarch truly invested in the Socialist system do exist. The Mladorossi themselves seek to combine ideas of Russian Monarchism with the Soviet Socialist system, fusing Marxist principles with Russian Nationalism and Traditionalism under the embrace of a Red Crown and Aristocracy and united by Orthodox faith."
autocratic_socialist_subtype:0 "Autocratic Socialism"
autocratic_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Autocratic Socialism)§!\n\nAutocratic Socialist regimes are highly authoritarian dictatorships that (at least on paper) adhere to socialist principles. They are notably varied, but can usually be seen with some form of command economy, emphasis on militarism, are often nationalist or use patriotism as a tool of the state, and are frequently at odds with more mainline Charter Totalists. While their commitment to Socialist revolutionary principles is usually questionable at best, these regimes still maintain socialism as the official state ideology, and go to lengths to paint their government red - even if the government is nothing short of a total dictatorship."
red_junta_subtype:0 "Red Junta"
red_junta_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Red Junta)§!\n\nMilitary juntas with explicitly leftist slants are as diverse as their non-red counterparts, but what unites them is a professed need for the military to 'defend' socialism within the nation they've taken root in. While the authority of generals and soldiers now starts to supplant the authority of commissars and secretaries, the Red Junta will do its utmost to remove perceived corrupt civilian bureaucrats and subversive elements that would misuse the revolutionary government's wheels of power for their own ends. This removal typically involves a deeply autocratic police state and waves of martial build-up so that the junta's power may eventually morph into something less militant once the deeds are done, or, in less generous regimes, for the junta to permanently solidify its grip on the nation. Despite this new wave of militant authoritarianism, however, socialist governance commonly remains in Red Juntas alongside the crackdowns, with the lower classes still afforded the welfare and various protections they were promised before the junta's assent into power."
caponism_subtype:0 "Mafioso Socialism"
caponism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Mafia Socialism)§!\n\nMafioso Socialism, often just called Caponism or Caponeism after its leading ‘theorist’, is the ideology ascribed to notable crime lord and pseudosocialist Alphonse Capone, who rose to political prominence within the American Socialist movement during the Civil War. Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."

Claiming that only through total self-sufficiency and with total devotion to the one Supreme Leader can the nation truly achieve real Socialism, and eventually, utopia. Harsh towards any form of Liberalism, Counter-Revolutionary action, or any other ideas deemed an obstacle to the state, only through total loyalty to the Party and to the Supreme Leader can one reap the benefits of the state, and all those who fail in these duties are branded enemies of the state without remorse."
molotovism_subtype:0 "Molotovism"
molotovism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Molotovism)§!\n\nMolotovism represents a variant of Bolshevik-Leninist thought that emerged in the context of extreme mobilisation and ideological pressure, leading to it prioritizing the achievement of objectives such as national reconstruction, state centralisation, and rigid class dictatorship. This doctrine, also known as National Bolshevism or Russian Marxism represents an attempt to revitalise Lenin's legacy as a blueprint for salvation of socialist Russia in an environment characterised by hostility and internal turmoil. Vyacheslav Molotov contends that Vladimir Lenin was a true national Bolshevik because he championed not only an international revolution, but also the liberation of Russian masses from the shackles of external and internal oppression. In Molotov's view, imperialism and bourgeois democracy were not merely social systems, they were nothing short of the manifestations of national humiliation perpetuated by the elites - often described as \"people with French or German accents\" - ruling over the majority class of peasants and workers. The goal of Molotovism is to transform the state into a unified mobilization machine, involving industrialization and collectivization, a repressive bureaucracy, and central planning. Nonetheless, National Bolshevism does not rely on chauvinism, for the Chairman has adopted the concept of "one Soviet people", where everyone residing and working in the Socialist Fatherland is considered part of a unified working class, irrespective of linguistic, ethnic, or regional affiliations. The Russian language, political culture, and historical heritage shall be perceived as the cornerstones of national unity and the central instruments of socialist revolution."

Combining the esoteric spiritual beliefs of the Mau-Mau group that raises Obama as the physical manifestation of their patron deity the ‘Ghost Goat’ with occultist practices, witchcraft, shamanism, Socialist Pan-Africanism, and Pan-African Nationalism, this syncretic ideology is unique in its outlook on the traditional Pan-African cause. Calling for cooperation and unity between all peoples of African under a totalitarian but benevolent Socialist hereditary theocracy under the prophet Obama that is backed by a strong volunteer and fanatically devoted military and supported by an economy vaguely resembling autarkic Agrarian National Syndicalism mixed with traditional tribalist practices, Obamaism is a ideology that could only be forged in the melting pot of chaos and extremism that is colonial Africa."
jacobinism_subtype:0 "Red Jacobinism"
jacobinism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Red Jacobinism)§!\n\nThe so-called 'Red Jacobins' represent the larger of the two factions composing the French Communist Party, commonly known as the Jacobin faction within the Commune. Led by the 'Son of the People' who worked his way up as an example to others from the lowest strata of society, Maurice Thorez, the mainstream of the French Communists upholds the orthodoxy as outlined by Marx and expanded upon by V.I. Lenin. Yet much to the surprise of some people who still remember Lenin calling Robespierre a 'Bolshevik avant la lettre', the 'Reds' enhance their Communist doctrine with the legacy of the Cordeliers, Enragés, Hébertists and Sans-Culottes. In such groups of the Great Revolution they find the beginnings of true Socialist thought, focusing on the urban proletariat and the poor workers, distrustful of the corrupting power of the political office and rabid anti-clericalism, going as far as drowning the clergy in rivers to liberate the mass from the opiate and grant them the Cult of Reason. Thorez also draws much from the proto-Communist 'Conspiracy of the Equals' led by François-Noël Babeuf whose legacy was carried to the First Paris Commune by the Neo-Babouvists. Thus, with the uniquely French Revolutionary legacy in one hand and the pure science of Marx and Lenin in the other, the Red PCF aims to establish a true Dictatorship of the Proletariat based on the principles of Democratic Centralism, ardent in class warfare, dogmatic in total unity and submission of the entire Left to the party, and ready to transform the French worker into a New Socialist Man prepared to carry the torch of the Revolution so brutally dimmed by the reactionary enemy."

esoteric_leninism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Roerichism)§!\n\nLeft Roerichism - also called Leftist Agni Yoga Thought, Esoteric Leninism, or Buddho-Communism - is a mutation of the original ‘Rerikhism’ of Nicholas Roerich and his wife Helena inspired by the whispers of the mahatmas and the impressive humanitarian efforts of Vladimir Lenin and other prominent Socialists across the world that have fought to free humanity from oppression. Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."

Created by the likes of Chief Thomas ‘New Moon’ Dixon, Dixonism seeks to fuse the tribalist, nationalist, militarist, corporatist, anti-clericalist, and highly xenophobic ideas of Towner’s platform with the Leftist economics and radical populisms of the Charter Totalists and their various subfactions, like Mosley’s Maximists or Mussolini’s National Syndicalists, seemingly at odds with the anti-Europeanism so inherent to Townerism’s core, yet Dixon cares not for minor indiscrepancies so long as the Red Race is set free to reclaim Turtle Island - the widely-shared indigenous name for the New World - once more. Further influenced by the likes of the Mau Mau’s most radical members, namely the violent Pan-Bantu supremacism of Stanley Mathenge that inspired the dream of a united Turtle Island, and the anti-European strain of Charter Totalism pioneered independently by Onyango Obama of whom Dixon believes is the true founder of the ideology, Chief New Moon shall stop at nothing to cleanse Turtle Island from all sources of White Devil influence as he works to unite the First Peoples under his crimson banner, no matter the cost."

A mix of Authoritarianism and pure Socialist Democracy, Popular Communism seeks to safeguard the Revolution without resorting to infighting, excess violence, brutal repressions and reprisals, and other inhumane practices.

Seizing the opportunity, he has transformed Savinkovism into a genuine force on the Left, a syncretization of elements borrowed from Left SRs and certain Charter-adjacent foreign movements. Revolutionary Savinkovism combines the Agrarian Socialist terrorist legacy of its founder with the political programme of the long-dead Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries-Maximalists, a splinter group Socialist-Revolutionary Party advocating for a single stage overthrow of the calcified bourgeois system upheld by its agents on the Right and the Left. Only through direct action, an unyielding spirit of violence directed against everyone stopping the People, shall Russia liberate itself from the shackles imposed on it by history. Directed by their 'born dictator', a Maximalist synthesis of Blanquism and Pyotr Tkachev's theories, the Toilers shall develop a consciousness, the secret 'knowledge', necessary for the establishment of the Republic of the Third Russia, a spin introduced by Savinkov himself based on the writings of his friend Dmitry Merezhkovsky.

While the Crusader White Shirts, an organization he created in the wake of the economic crisis rocking the United States, was heavily inspired by both the proto-Charterite Totalists, Bolsheviks, Technocrats, the Klan and even Fordists, their main source of inspiration lies in the works of the "Three Southern Sociologists". The first and most important of them is George Fitzhugh, author of the notion that the entire state should be organized around slavery extended to the entire population, even the Whites, combined with a strict caste system and utter rejection of the 'infidel doctrines of natural liberty' advocated by the 'sages of 1776'. While originally considering himself an opponent of capital and in support of a welfare state, he later turned towards the exaltation of paternalistic monopoly capitalism. The second of them is Henry Hughes, creator of the 'warraneetism' concept in which the employer class would enslave the labourers under the watchful eye of the state. In exchange for the work, the 'warrantors' would provide the working class with not only all amenities, but even transportation, healthcare, and new opportunities. The last one of them, James Dunwoody Brownson De Bow, was the least 'leftist' of his compatriots and advocated for a strong system of independent Southern commerce and agriculture overseen by a technocratic-scientific management. While the ideas brought back to the surface by Christians are on the very fringe of the American society, perhaps one day the 'Second Southern Revolution' shall sweep away the notion of the shared 'Constitution' and values of people that yet oppose the drive to fix the world which is 'too little governed'."

And from this ideological malaise, what would become Hardliner Bolshevism began to take form. Primarily used by critics of the tendency, Hardliner Bolshevism is used to describe those who adhered to the same conclusion: That the failure of the Bolshevik Revolution was caused not by any innate flaws with the ideology, but rather a failure in defending the socialist state and entrenching ideological conviction within the people and the Communist Party. Primarily espoused by Lazar Kaganovich, Victor Wilcox, and many more, those who are identified with the tendency argue for vastly authoritarian measures to defend the revolution beyond conventional Leninist principles, such as national militarization, state terror, a command economy and civil social-patriotism tied to the state instead of the nation. However, perhaps most notable is a vehement opposition to perceived 'revisionism' against Marx and Lenin, seeing all other dissenting socialists as merely 'pretenders' and 'bourgeois agents' seeking to upturn the teachings of Marx and Lenin.

And thus, these ideologues have distanced themselves from traditional Marxist-progressive dogma, and instead envisioned themselves as the heralds of an Ottoman Revolution that shall come about it in two-stage revolution: the battle to achieve the revolutionary movement’s surge to power, and the ongoing battle to liberate the economy and all of Ottoman society from imperialist influence. while being a third avenue towards national liberation free from the Left-Right divide, avoiding the pitfalls of capitalism, communism, syndicalism, or corporatism. Those who rallied behind the tendency dreamt of creating a united Turkish, or wider Ottoman state supported by Kemalist principles including secular statisma and centralist developmentalism, while promoting explicitly state socialist policies, such as a planned Leftist economy inspired by the Leninist NEP and Gosplan, and the promotion of non-ethnic social patriotism, or leftist civic nationalism where all contributing members of society, no matter their ethnic, religious, or cultural background, are considered true citizens aiding in the wider effort of anti-imperialist revolution and national rejuvenation. Despite employing reactionary-adjacent rhetoric at times, the Kadrotheorists have explicitly denounced Far Right ideologies such as Italian Legionarism and Maurassisme, condemning them as racist and imperialist ideologies designed to benefit the bourgeoisie of the industrialized nations, while lauding the Internationale for destroying the imperialist entities that were the French and British empires and for their continued committal to opposing the German colonial hegemon. However, certain Right-leaning theorists of the tendency have voiced their support for the Savinkovites and other anti-elitist reactionary revolutionaries of his kind, while also equally critique the Left, calling out the Third Internationale’s tendency to only focus on the industrialized world, as well as its paternalism at strongarming the struggles of the colonized world as secondary to the class conflicts within the industrialized West, showing the heterodox nature of the tendency.

Fusing ideas of American Exceptionalism and patriotism, anti-Syndicalism, anti-Capitalism, and anti-Liberalism with a new concept of Conservative American Socialism based in Trotskyist thought, Burnhamites push for a stronger and expanded American state under an all-power executive with endless emergency powers further supported by the Continental Socialist Society - a fraternal group of militiamen and founding party members loyal to Burnham’s every word - as well as by a domineering military-industrial complex, a modernized and expanded armed forces, and a shackled, weakened technocratic system in order to aid their economy based on vertical integration, violent wealth redistribution and the occasional deal with a reeducated bourgeoise, craft unionism, political triangulation supported by institutionalized inter-party corruption and nepotism, totalitarian societal planning, and nationalized command economics, even going so far as to replace the Lower House, or Senate, with a new body of puppeted technocrats and loyal party members to dominate the Legislature as well. Utilizing scare tactics, mass surveillance, and a cult of personality and national patriotism to ensure mass loyalty against the encroaching Anglo, German, and Syndicalist hordes, Burnhamites feud extensively with their Vanguardist rivals in America under Browder and Foster, rejecting the Vanguardist method and wider Communism while issuing an ultimatum to these faux-Socialists of either join or die, instead preaching a Continentalist message of Anti-Capitalist unity that seeks to unite all of North America under Burnham’s unique vision, and thus placing all of North America in the palm of his ambitious hand. Under the Marxist Machiavelli and America’s greatest patriot James Burnham, America will never be the same again as it fuses the nation’s Socialist and Conservative halves into one cohesive whole."

Supporting the idea of ‘From each according to his ability, to each according to his need’, Anarcho-Communism calls for distribution and redistribution of society’s resources, the eradication of state tyranny, the creation of a stateless Socialist society supported by communalism, and the abolishment of private property so that it may be replaced with personal property and collective-ownership, along with many other traditional Communist positions that differ greatly with the specific group. However, Anarcho-Communists are as varied as they are dedicated to their united cause, split between a variety of sects and off-shoots like the endlessly bickering Organizationalist and Insurrectionary cliques that battle for dominance as the Insurrectionists draw from egoism and radical individualism while the Organizationalists stay rooted in more traditional Leftist influences of societal cooperation and mass cohesion. Beneath the broad umbrellas of these two titanic groups stand the Platformist Anarchists seeking to cooperate with all the various competing Anarchist schools of thought regardless of differences, the Synthesis Anarchists seeking to unite and syncretize the various breeds of Anarchism into one cohesive thoughtform, and the smaller groups like the agrarian Magonistas, educated Kropotkinites, violent Makhnovists, insurrectionist Galleanisti, and many more, all vying for their own interpretation of society, but all still united in the Anarchist position that stateless revolution is needed in order to eventual breed true Communism and a Socialist utopia."

Practiced by pirate groups from the Great Lakes of America’s Rust Belt to the stormy seas of Southeast Asia, this strange and syncretic ideology seemingly inspired by old tales of the egalitarian pirate paradise Libertalia calls for the creation of a radical Leftist society free from state tyranny and oppressive theory, and supported socio-economically and culturally by piracy and other criminal acts, and in some cases also by dockworkers’ or fishermen organizations and other nautical unions of the local maritime industry. The varied movement is tied to ideas like Caponeism, Illegalism, Individualist Anarchism, Mobster Populism, Communalism, Syndicalism, nautical Unionism, and other fringe forms of Leftist or semi-Leftist ideology that rage against traditional statist and societal structures, and stands to uphold piracy and its many criminal facets and lifestyles as both the lifeblood of the economy and of their ‘theory’, which is largely spread through the propaganda of the deed and criminal action over any literature or organized doctrine.

tot_illegalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Illegalism)§!\n\nIllegalism is a strain of Left Anarchism popularized in France, Italy, Switzerland, and the Low Countries that mainly spawns from Individualistic and Insurretionary tendencies, and Albert Libertad’s idea of Anarchism embodying the joy of living over militant sacrifice to some hierarchy or societal standard imposed by the State. Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as both a way of life and a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob - who resist collectivism while holding that their crimes are an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement in line with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no such moral basis. Additionally, the Expropriative Anarchists of Spain and Argentina, such as Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso, Severino Di Giovanni, and Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, hold similar views as both Illegalist cliques, but only see criminality as a means to a political end, not a way of life worth living past the Revolution’s success. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies by using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a Anarchist utopia."

This ideology combines the essence of Cossack identity and heritage with the principles of socialism, creating a distinct socialist system of governance. Drawing inspiration from national-oriented communist movements such as National-Communism, the Red Cossack Dictatorship emphasizes the importance of recognizing and preserving national and cultural peculiarities within the framework of Marxist and communist principles. It rejects cosmopolitanism and globalization, advocating instead for the preservation and autonomy of a Cossack culture. While the Red Cossack Dictatorship shares some similarities with military dictatorships, it maintains a distinctive leftist orientation and a focus on achieving socialist objectives. It may exhibit less authoritarianism and militarism compared to other socialist regimes. Some variations of this ideology may strive to establish socialism and maintain power until their vision of a just society is achieved, while others may allow for elections once reactionary forces are subdued.

Leftist Feminists often fight not only for the emancipation of their gender and equal rights, but often for the rights of all people in a hopefully fairer future society. While active in parties and groups ranging from Anarchism through Syndicalism to Marxism and even National Syndicalism, most congregate inside the biggest Socialist parties in a given nation.

The main aims of Neo-Socialism are to usher in a 'Constructive Revolution', using the mass popular mandate to establish an authoritarian technocratic government of experts that would plan out society's transformation into a system that old Socialism has failed to achieve. The destructive ideas of class struggle are to be replaced by class collaboration and national solidarity, the anti-capitalist rhetoric increased and existing union institutions subjugated to fit the aims of Neosocialism. In case of Déat's uniquely French implementation, the PSdF also sees itself as the true Jacobins, fighting tirelessly against the phantasmagoric mockery provided by Thorez and his ilk while also combating Anarchists and their chaos-spreading ways. Despite that Marcel Déat himself and many other Neo-Socialist groups are, owing to their origins in the pacifist movements prevalent among Socialist groups before the Weltkrieg, hesitant to support militarism and instead prefer to pursue a peaceful unification and cooperation of all European nations, if they are not enemies of the New Socialism of course."

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that both unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth, and protects the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things that is supported by traditional family values, feminism, education reform, and chastity while rejecting forms of spiritual elitism and societal laziness such as monasticism, medicantism, and asceticism, for self-exertion and service to humanity is paramount. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

They are often more orthodox on the economic front where they encourage the transition of wealth from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat.

Initially organized by the sister writing duo Paulette and Jeanne Nardal of Martinique, and later expanded with the help of Martinican poète Aimé Césaire, the Senegalese thinkers Abdoulaye Sadji and Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Léon Damas of French Guiana along with others like Gilbert Gratiant, Leonard Sainville, Louis T. Achille, Aristide Maugée, Négritude at its core is a collaborative thoughtform that disavows colonialism, racism, imperialism, inequality, and Eurocentrism while promoting independent and revitalized African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties in order to remove any stigma against African civilization while uplifting the African diaspora to an equal position of comradery and cooperation with the rest of the world; all atop a base of Marxist political philosophy in the Black radical tradition - however non-Marxist forms of Socialism like Social Democratism, Syndicalism, National Syndicalism, and other more extremist Leftist offshoots have become more common as the ideologies of the Third Internationale and further Socialists abroad continue to mutate and influence the African continent, especially as the Afro-Surrealist artistic foundations of the Négritude movement fuse with European concepts of the surreal and the futuristic. Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique. Refuting the idea of African cultural assimilation or notions of Africa being any less civilized than the rest of the world, the Négritude movement seeks to put Francophonic Africa on the path to shining glory, sitting at the global table as united, or at least cooperating, equals with the rest of the world while making the concept of being Black, or Négre, something to only be proud of."

Taking from both Anarcho-Syndicalist and more traditional Marxist currents - particularly from the idealist, antipositivist, anti-evolutionist, and anti-materialist works of Italian thinkers like Antonio Gramsci and his theory of cultural hegemony, as well as from Benedetto Croce and Antonio Labriola, while also holding some similarities to Mexico’s own Far-Left pro-indigenists the Mexicayotl - Mariáteguismo offers a syncretic path forward for Peru’s indigenous souls while also caring for the larger Hispanicized population in a liberated system purged of imperialist corruption, anti-native sentiment, and the toxic Hispanicism that has led South America to ruin since the arrival of the Spanish. Mariáteguismo also curiously holds links to Peru’s avant-garde, with early Mariáteguist works being penned alongside Mariátegui’s own close friend, the famed Peruvian writer and narrator Pedro Abraham Valdelomar Pinto, which has also led to some more foreign ideas of the avant-garde scene flowing in from Paris and Italy. Citing the idea that Peru under the Inca and the other pre-Columbian tribes was a communalist, even proto-socialist network of societies built around collectivism and mass obedience to a shared social duty, Mariáteguismo believes that ‘The Conquest’ or the invasion of the Conquistadors triggered a split not only in our history, but our economics as well with the invading Europeans forcing us into a feudalist system that has only eroded Peru’s native culture and identity in the centuries since. Rejecting the corrupted law of Gamonalism, or ‘Bossism’, innate to the post-colonial bureaucracies of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, while refuting any deals and treaties they forced on past native groups, Mariáteguism seeks to undo the damage these many centuries of pro-European elitism, corruption, and capitalism has wrought on the Andes by tearing down the old order, divorcing the central government from the clutches of the gamonal, nationalizing the various resources and industries founded by natives that were later stolen and expanded by these gamonalists once and for all, and in general creating a revolutionary new Socialist state based along Marxist and Syndicalist syncretic lines, all in tune with the pro-indigenism and autonomous communalism of Mariáteguis himself."

Anti-democratic and abstentionist to the core, seeing the incorporation of Social Democratic and Right Opposition movements as a capitulation to capitalism and counterrevolutionary currents, Bordigists refute any participation in elections, and instead support the Leninist idea of a dictatorship of the proletariat (despite also heavily criticizing Lenin himself) along with organic centralism while rejecting the totalitarian nature seen in some surviving post-Bolshevik movements, positioning themselves as the true Left Communist scions of modern Marxism while holding the view that most Socialist governments of the post-Great War era have only been extending the liberal and bourgeois nature of prior revolutions that have since degenerated, as all had in common a policy of expropriation, along with agrarian and productive development, which Bordiga considered negations of previous conditions as opposed to the genuine construction of true Socialism from a unique and revolutionary source. Refusing to split the idea of Communism and Socialism as many Leninists do, Bordigists instead views Socialism as an unmatured and undeveloped form of Communism born from a Capitalist nation that must slowly mature into a Communist state, likening his definition of Socialism to Marx’s concept of lower-phase Communism that needs shepherding by vanguardist force on the road to true Communism. Against notions of personality cults or united fronts that only compromise the Communist message, Bordigists still hold some loyalty to the idea of Socialist Internationalism, and though no Bordigist would openly call themselves a Trotskyist, their movements do hold some tangential links and similar beliefs. Sometimes called Italian ‘Ultra-Leftism’ as a way to refer to their anti-Bolshevik, anti-Syndicalist, anti-Anarchist, and anti-Social Democratic ways along with their hatred for electoralism, technocratism, unionism, councilism, opportunism, liberalism, and reformism - instead banking on the natural and sudden spark of organic revolution as triggered by the proletarian masses with help from the vanguard - Bordgisits refuse compromise, cooperation, and the concept of slowly acclimating the proletariat and wider society to their radical ways in order to force the mass good of their ‘unique’ Communist theory onto Italian society as rapidly as possible."

The thoughtform was first officialized and outlined in Marinetti's Manifesto del Futurismo with help from other artists who worked alongside Marinetti in the original futurist group formerly centered in Milan, like Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. The movement at its core is an artistically-driven rejection of the past that seeks to unshackle the nation from any former identity in order to actualize the realization of a perfected future form, with Italian Futurism specifically glorifying modernity and the possibility and motion of an unknown and aesthetically-evolved future over any common sources of Italian traditionalism like the Renaissance or the Romans, with the goal to liberate Italy from the weight of its past entirely so as to fly into the boundless possibly of tomorrow. Despite being one of the most famous interventionist proponents alongside Benitto Mussolini, with whose National Revolutionary Bloc Marinetti has aligned after the establishment of the Socialist Republic, the unique 'Futurist Political Party' has outlined its own truly revolutionary programme separate from the likes of Charterist National-Syndicalism. In their political manifesto 'Democrazia Futurista', followers of the great artist have called for violent and precise anti-clericalism, abolition of the military in favour of light volunteer force, destruction of marriage in favour of nationalized upbringing of children and tax on free love, mass de-bureaucratization, full equality between the genders, Georgist inspired land reform, and a system of proportional reprensenation leading to the election of a technical one chamber government constituted by twenty members under 30 years of age representing all important social strata fairly. With all of their proposals, the Left Futurists aim to tear down the current order full of criminals and reactionaries both on the Right and on the Left, and where socialists and anarchists have always refused to wage war, in order to bring about 'the only hygiene of the world' as the Futurists have termed it. Although their nature is highly egalitarian and opposed to totalitarian modes of state, in recent years - owing to the shape Italy has found itself in - a radical wing centered around long-time Futurist Giuseppe Bottai has begun to grow, borrowing much from the National-Syndicalists and aligning with foreign supremacist movements."

The in a way counter-Charterists have been called to action by what they see as a long developing betrayal of the Syndicalist and Socialist ideals, ultimately resulting in crazed Totalitarianism bent on destruction of everything that they oppose, the Reformists instead often seek to return to the principles outlined exactly in such documents as Carnaro's, guaranteeing a model of collective sovereignty for all citizens regardless of sex, race, language, class, or religion, with institutions infused by Anarcho-Syndicalism and lessons from the cards of Urban Medieval Italian and Athenian Democratic history.

Publishing his new theses in the newspaper 'La Verita', modeled after the former Bolshevik newspaper 'Pravda', the failure of the Leninist Revolution and the triumphant proclamation of the Socialist Republic in Torino have deeply influenced Bombacci, leaving both the corpse of the PSI and the divided PCd'I in favour of exclaiming the virtue of what he saw as the true movement of workers, a movement to which the most militant from his environment gravitated, a movement led by a man he shares a lot of history with from their younger days. Massimalismo has borrowed much from Mussolinism, merging the doctrines of National Syndicalism with Marxism and writing of V.I Lenin, yet replacing aspects of both. Where the Totalists shun the Vanguard Party, Bombacci sees the revitalized state of the nation hopefully ushered in by the Charter as the only way for a successful Vanguard to be formed after the events of the Russian Civil War. Where the Marxists call for seizing the means of production, National Maximalists yearn for the 'socialization of the economy', a concept developed by Edmondo Cione. The movement led by Bombacci has been notably compared to the National Jacobin faction inside the Commune, especially by a fellow Communist now sympathizing with Totalism Henri Guilbeaux, who sees the fastest growing radical leftist ideology as the only way to usher in a true International Revolution, one that Trotsky failed to achieve. Yet true heirs to Marx, to Lenin the martyr of Socialism, people like Benito Mussolini can rouse the masses and achieve true Communism.

Sharing the argument that systems were made for men, and not the other way around, that its predecessor was formed around, Leftist Social Credit seeks to bend financial rules and mainstays along with the very notion of an ideological spectrum in order to ensure absolute socio-economic security for its populace, though the ideology is still split between more egalitarian and broad humanitarian cliques like those seen in the Ireland, or in places the United States with Robert Heinlein and New Zealand with John A.

To many Nkrumaism is the first native African attempt to formulate a Marxist analysis of the conditions and solutions for the Black Continent's anti-imperialist struggle, but painting the work of Gold Coast's, as the colonials refer to it, great statesman would be a disservice to the deep richness which permeates the ideological foundation upon which his Convention People's Party aims to govern. Consciencism is, above all, a great display of syncretism, combining the Euro-Christian, Islamic and original African influences with the works of Karl Max, V.I. Lenin and many Black American and Caribbean thinkers the likes of George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, C.L.R. James, W.E.B. Du Bois and Father Divine just to name a few. According to Nkrumah's closest associates, his philosophy is a Socialism of a non-atheist kind, meant to implement what all true religions teach yet not supplant them. That is freedom, unity, dignity and the right to self-determination of all peoples, all emboldened by Consciencism's view that pre-colonial Africa was a long of communalism and egalitarianism, values which can be brought back despite the damage the European institutions wrecked upon them. The critics of Ghana's rising star argue that Nkrumaism is nothing more than a mere cult of personality, reliant on one-party democratic centralism and populist state ownership policies while dressing the purely Utopian nature of its socialism in the supposed trappings of 'Scientific' Marxian elements. But these voices are nothing more than the cries of jealous opportunists and defeated imperialists, for Kwame Nkrumah knows that Africa Must Unite, and he shall ensure this vision comes to fruition."

Merging the patriotic and equalist zeal of the 'Archangel of Terror' and the putschist elite methods of establishing Socialism as according to Blanquism, the National PCF envisions that the will of the Revolutionary active shall become paramount to law. Galvanizing the heroic youth of the Jeunes Communistes to follow the example set out by the ceaseless revolutionary fervour and devotion of the Montagnard fathers, not even 30 years old when their flame was extinguished, the National Jacobins strive for nothing short of a total destruction of their enemies and military grandeur to achieve true Republicanism. Through the replacement of atheism with Cult of the Supreme Being, be it loosely defined, state collectivism with equal ownership of property under state capitalism, and outreach to oft forgotten by Leftists rural sector the Doriotist wing hopes to one day establish a renewed nation.

To remedy this the future government must, according to NSP's leader writings created together with the economist Nikolay Kondratiev, implement the 'New Economic Policy' leading to a gradual transition towards Socialism. This would be achieved through state regulation of a mixed economy using planned and market mechanisms, or 'Socialism in the City - Capitalism in the Village' as it was described during the party's foundational congress. While Bukharinism claims to represent 'True Leninism', it fluctuates between support for the Popular Front and its rejection in favor of the 'Party of the New Type', which has also led its proponents to differ on their stance towards trade unions, either championing their expansion or demanding their subservient transformation into production union."

Left Nationalism, sometimes also called Left-Wing Nationalism, Social Nationalism or even Popular Nationalism by people more averse to outright Socialist thought, is a broad categorization of various movements that combine their uniquely national struggle with the desire to remake the image of their societies into a more equal and caring visage. The differences between various parties under this label tend to be quite striking when one takes a closer look at them, for the 'Left' part may be tantamount to total uprooting of traditional structures that have kept the people in shackles - thus advocating a turn towards true Socialism in cultural and economic matters; or it may simply refer to a highly militant brand of progressivism that still upholds the vital role of the socialized market and some community-building institutions like religion. The 'Nationalist' part has been, similarly, interpreted quite widely, often falling out-of-balance into either the camp of ethnic, even racial, exceptionalism targeting very select groups or still upholding the civic-cultural tendency which was popular among the movements operating in multi-ethnic countries.

Born into an aristocratic family, the young politician became disillusioned with the cause of the Conservatives after their violent reprisals against the civilians of Ireland. Together with his wife Lady Cynthia 'Cimmie' Curzon, the pair subscribed to the ideals of Fabian Socialism and joined the Labour Party independents. In any other world such a charismatic individual may have become the next Prime Minister, but the British Revolution and the collapse of the monarchy required a dramatic shift in Mosley's tactics. Having constituted the 'Maximist' group within the Trade Union Congress, the former Baronet published an ambitious document outlining the vision for a reborn Britain. The 'Mosley Memorandum' postulated that only through the creation of a protectionist, autarkic, National Syndicalist state, enhanced by the teachings of his friend John Maynard Keynes, could the vestiges of class conflict be put behind and a new healthy national corpus established. Despite working within the structures of the TUC for years, the ideas of the Memorandum were never adopted, and thus Mosley grew frustrated with what he called the 'Red Baronocracy' that supposedly never cared about the ordinary people of Britain. Seeing himself as the successor of Tudorian Kings that broke the power of the aristocrats, and also the Lord Protector Cromwell, whom Mosley calls the 'First British Totalist', the leader of the Maximists has made great strides to harness the power of the lower classes in his mission of reshaping the entire Union into a state organized around the Chairman. Although Mosleyites advocated for the liberation of the former British Empire and reunification with culturally close peoples, they still wish to pursue a Pan-European programme with brotherly nations. One of the closest comrades of Mosley is Benito Mussolini, with whom Oswald shares much yet they do differ on social outlook. On average, Mosleyism is rather progressive, supporting tolerance on religious grounds, a non-ethnic national-state identity, feminist initiatives, and even welcoming transgender members like Victor Barker. Ultimately, British Maximism is the personal vehicle of Oswald Mosley, whose vision shall light and carry a flame in Britain which the ages shall never extinguish, a flame which direction may prove to be unanticipated and sometimes, shocking."

Councilists believe that the downfall of capitalism is inevitable, and the engine of the revolution can only be maintained through the emergence of independent and autonomous workers’ councils and organizations, ultimately ushering in the Dictatorship of the Proletariat through mass strikes and other forms of industrial action. This has, naturally, led Council Communists to establish new trade unions independent from the traditional ones, seen as merely a frontist mirage spun by an alliance of capitalist bourgeoisie and their reformist social democratic allies. Although these positions may suggest Councilism holds certain similarities with Revolutionary Syndicalism or Leninist Marxism, even sometimes borrowing industrial unionism and the concept of a one big union from the former and praising the efforts of the latter, it rejects those currents on specific ideological grounds. The Syndicalists often maintain bourgeois structures of power and unionism, creating “degenerated laborist states”, while orphans of Bolshevism would throw away the rule of the workers in favor of a new elite emerging from the vanguard party, enforcing its authority through state socialism. Ultimately, Council Communists are a diverse group of politicians and theoreticians, such as Anton Pannekoek, Herman Gorter, Otto Rühle, Sylvia Pankhurst, Paul Mattick; all of whom had to, at certain points, accept the necessary and temporary nature of states and political parties, although just as a stepping stone towards the propagation of class conscious proletariat ready to take the government into their own hands."

Souto, a close friend of the Spanish national syndicalist Ramiro Ledesma, has always been a stern supporter of national syndicalism but with his own, highly decentralized, peasant-focused and violent form. Peasant Charterism is tied to the emerging Galician politician force, the Bloque Social Campesino, and in its core, it is Souto’s own deep hatred for the proletariat and bourgeoisie made manifest. The central idea of the ideology is that the tillers and toilers of Iberian fields have been left out of political decisionmaking since the emergence of mass politics, but they in reality are the pristine, untouched people of the world, spared from the evil of being a ‘citizen’. The workers and ownership classes, lording over the land in their decadent cities, have become a mockery of man, elemental humans who have forced the peasant into hiding in their final redoubts, the backwater villages of regions like Galicia. These cities do little more than suck away the products that the peasants have grown and cultivated through the sweat of their brow.\n\nAccording to the Peasant Charterists, this order must be destroyed, with the landowners and corrupt caciquismo of Iberia torn down with the arming of the peasantry. In Souto’s vision, the councils and agrarian unions will become new organs of the people’s will, guided by peasant mass action with the state serving only to ensure societal cohesion. The tidal wave of popular mobilization of the peasantry shall bring about a truly purified revolution, where old institutions no longer dictate the spontaneous and noble life of the rural folk. After all, where science, political theory, culture and religious life has flourished throughout human history, there has always been fertile soil and dirty hands of the peasantry to provide for them, and as the growers of empires, it is only just that a new age shall dawn upon Iberia, guided by the humble pristine man."

Sailing from the distant Mediterranean shores he would first arrive in Rio Grande do Sul and join the local Republican Party, much to the chagrin of his father who was a devouted federalist. The two fundamental influences on the future political philosophy of Nequete would be acquired by him in Porto Alegre, where he became a believer in Kardecist Spiritism as well as organized the Popular Defense League to defend the working classes. In the closing years of the Weltkrieg the future founder of the Maximalist Union would cooperate with anarchists, reach out to soldiers, and be active in various syndicates and trade unions. Following disagreements with many 'libertarian' members of the early Communist movement of Brazil, as well as the electoral failures and laborist policies of many a 'socialist' party around the globe, Abílio would reject the manual workers as the revolutionary vanguard, instead seeing the technician as the only non-parasitic producer in society. Thus, Evidentismo was born - a new religion blending spiritualism inspired by Allan Kardec, the vestiges of Bolshevism, and his native Christianity - later merged with the ideal of technocratic elite, best described by Abílio in the following reflection: '‘Without the intelligent element, no party will win. It is enough to know how to define the working class: doctors, engineers, astronomers, chemists, military personnel, artists, and all workers, whether manual or intellectual, to dispel many doubts’. Evidentist Technocracy takes Marx’s stages and develops them further, seeing the chain of Ancient Civilizations, Feudalism, Capitalism, Communism, and finally Technocracy as the natural conclusion to the evolution of mankind. The real revolutionary group, having reincarnated their spirits to improve both materially and morally until the desired perfection is achieved, shall work selflessly to reorganize the entirety of society in the vision of good and charity. At the head of the world, in which all the technicians have united, will stand Abílio de Nequete - a man of uncompromising dogmatic vision, possessing total control over the road to utopia, and one that will shatter the hierarchies of old and new until nothing stands in the way of the inheritors of Curie, Einstein, Santos-Dumont, and Edison."

The revolutions which rocked Britain and Spain, despite outward sympathy, gave way to the old imperialism painted red. Michel Aflaq, having studied in the Commune shortly after growing up, came to one realization when observing his native Syria - the Arabs require Revival. Influenced to various extents by the troubled communist movement, Antun Saadeh’s Social Nationalism, as well as Zaki al-Arsuzi and Wahib al-Ghanim’s radically socialist Ba’athism, the Arab Revitalization Movement would become Aflaq’s ideological focus, leaving the day-to-day party organization to his close friend Salah al-Din al-Bitar. Arab Ihya is founded on three pillars, Wahda, Hurriyya, Ishtirākiyya (Unity, Freedom, Socialism). Through unity of all Arabs into one nation the progressive decline of their lands will be halted, ensuring the eradication of feudalism, sectarianism, regionalism, intellectual reactionism and the achievement of a new renaissance. Liberty shall not blindly copy the Occidental models, but instead will lead towards a revolutionary vanguard ushering in the people’s tutelage - a transitional period in which the pluralism of thought, not of the vote, strengthens the righteous cause of the party. Lastly, 'Socialism' has nothing to do with the supremacy of dialectical materialism - although Aflaq does not deny the importance of material conditions - nor the socio-economic delusions of the paranoid al-Arsuzi. Muhammad himself implemented Arab socialism during his conquests, freeing the people from enslavement and turning them into independent individuals. Just like he opposes both capitalism and syndo-communism, Aflaq rejects atheism and fundamentalism, instead favoring the equality of all religions and official state secularism, a stance quite common among Arab Christians like him. The clerical establishments have utilized Islam for far too long as the opiate of the masses, forgetting that Muhammad’s revolution was the ultimate expression of Arabism, as it fulfilled needs and embodied the values of all Arabs through the revealed Arabic Quran. One does not need to worship Islam, but one has to understand that his culture is intrinsically linked to the faith spread by Muhammad - a figure to be respected and followed as the hero who created a nation. Many may deride the Amid (Leader) of Harakat al-Ihyā' al-'Arabī as a thief, a 'puppet Roman emperor', a 'Cypriot Christian', alongside countless other false accusations, but no one will stop the force unleashed by Aflaq.

Forming a unique blend of National Syndicalism and home brewed Swedish nationalism, it espouses a distinctly national revolution, uniting the common Swedish worker and the Swedish nation into an inseparable unit. Rooted in the ideals of Oswald Mosely's Maximism and the Totalist Charter, Lindholmism differs from his thought by rejecting its deemed ‘Anglophilia’ and reinterpreted by Lindholm through a truly Swedish lens for Sweden. Declaring itself in opposition to liberal-capitalism and its decadence, as well as internationalised syndicalism, seeing such an international view as a direct betrayal of a vanguard revolution. In similarity with Maximists and National Syndicalists, all industries are nationalised, once noble estates seized and Swedish culture reborn under the guiding hand of the party apparatus and Lindholm himself. To Lindholmers, the revolution is not just a political or economic upheaval, but a spiritual one, aiming to remould the Swedish soul in a synthesis of revolutionary ideals and the iron will of the Caroleans of old, creating a peasant based revolutionary ideology. Integrating the ideals of discipline and endurance of the Carolean peasant soldiers, Lindholmism then embraces such peasant traditions, seeking to tame and preserve the natural landscape of the far North. Opposition is then met with a similar discipline of the Caroleans, suppressing supposed decadence in an attempt that the revolution remains unbroken. While holding to the common strive for industrialisation, Lindholmism maintains sacred sights across the nation, fully embracing Gothic architectural heritage and a romantic image of the North. Placing an unusual reverence upon the natural world, devoid of pagan thought, it portrays Sweden’s natural landscape, its forests and rivers, as eternal symbols of the revolution. Sources of strength, purity and eternal renewal in the face of adversaries, such natural wonders must then be protected from exploitation and decay. As such, Lindholmism thus represents the ultimate synthesis of National Syndicalism without foreign corruption in form, Swedish cultural revival in content, and as a total revolution in practice. To be a Lindholmer is to live bound to the idea that only when the state commands not just the economy and the nation's institutions, but the very heart of every Swede, shall the revolution be complete."

As such, it is usually more conservative and agriculturally focused while putting great emphasis on the need to capitalize on existing infrastructure left behind by colonialism so that it may be used as a foundation to reach even greater heights than the imperialist and capitalist past could ever aspire to, and is also usually friendly to the traditional customs of Africa's many varied ethnic groups and their derivatives across the Diaspora. However, both pro-tribalist and anti-tribalist variants do exist, as well as more traditionalist and modernist forms as well.

Against Socialist Democracy, seeing it as too bourgeois, and against Communism or Totalism for being so-called ‘state-capitalists’ in a Red guise, De Leonism seeks to blaze a new middle and shared pathway forward for American Syndicalists and Marxists that respects the realities and histories of the America and its various Labor movements while creating a system that satisfies and liberates all."

The central tenet of Georgist philosophy states that although people should value what they themselves produce, the ‘economic rent’ - or all natural resources and other common goods of an area - must be owned equally by all members within a society. Putting forth that the only tax should be on land value, for taxing the economic rent only leads to inefficiencies and exploitation, Georgism is primarily concerned with economics, but has since been tied to ideas ranging from Syndicalism and Progressivism to Democratic Socialism and Left Libertarianism to certain strains of Anarchism and even non-Socialist ideologies in more Rightist and Centrist circles.

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart.

Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as both a way of life and a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob - who resist collectivism while holding that their crimes are an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement in line with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no such moral basis. Additionally, the Expropriative Anarchists of Spain and Argentina, such as Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso, Severino Di Giovanni, and Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, hold similar views as both Illegalist cliques, but only see criminality as a means to a political end, not a way of life worth living past the Revolution’s success. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies by using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a Anarchist utopia."

While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work.

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that both unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth, and protects the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things that is supported by traditional family values, feminism, education reform, and chastity while rejecting forms of spiritual elitism and societal laziness such as monasticism, medicantism, and asceticism, for self-exertion and service to humanity is paramount. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Initially organized by the sister writing duo Paulette and Jeanne Nardal of Martinique, and later expanded with the help of Martinican poète Aimé Césaire, the Senegalese thinkers Abdoulaye Sadji and Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Léon Damas of French Guiana along with others like Gilbert Gratiant, Leonard Sainville, Louis T.

Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique.

Taking from both Anarcho-Syndicalist and more traditional Marxist currents - particularly from the idealist, antipositivist, anti-evolutionist, and anti-materialist works of Italian thinkers like Antonio Gramsci and his theory of cultural hegemony, as well as from Benedetto Croce and Antonio Labriola, while also holding some similarities to Mexico’s own Far-Left pro-indigenists the Mexicayotl - Mariáteguismo offers a syncretic path forward for Peru’s indigenous souls while also caring for the larger Hispanicized population in a liberated system purged of imperialist corruption, anti-native sentiment, and the toxic Hispanicism that has led South America to ruin since the arrival of the Spanish. Mariáteguismo also curiously holds links to Peru’s avant-garde, with early Mariáteguist works being penned alongside Mariátegui’s own close friend, the famed Peruvian writer and narrator Pedro Abraham Valdelomar Pinto, which has also led to some more foreign ideas of the avant-garde scene flowing in from Paris and Italy. Citing the idea that Peru under the Inca and the other pre-Columbian tribes was a communalist, even proto-socialist network of societies built around collectivism and mass obedience to a shared social duty, Mariáteguismo believes that ‘The Conquest’ or the invasion of the Conquistadors triggered a split not only in our history, but our economics as well with the invading Europeans forcing us into a feudalist system that has only eroded Peru’s native culture and identity in the centuries since. Rejecting the corrupted law of Gamonalism, or ‘Bossism’, innate to the post-colonial bureaucracies of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, while refuting any deals and treaties they forced on past native groups, Mariáteguism seeks to undo the damage these many centuries of pro-European elitism, corruption, and capitalism has wrought on the Andes by tearing down the old order, divorcing the central government from the clutches of the gamonal, nationalizing the various resources and industries founded by natives that were later stolen and expanded by these gamonalists once and for all, and in general creating a revolutionary new Socialist state based along Marxist and Syndicalist syncretic lines, all in tune with the pro-indigenism and autonomous communalism of Mariáteguis himself."

This would have been the natural state of the world if not for the Internationalist Revolutions, for the drastic political reshuffling which occurred in the aftermath of the War gave rise to - and emboldened the resolve of previously existing - Christian Syndicalist movements. To some, like the French Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens, their involvement is limited to continuing their conservative stances as part of the newly founded Federation of Communes while allying with moderates such as the SFIO. To others, like Fulvio Milani’s Federazione Nazionale dei Mezzadri e dei Piccoli Affittuari, the real goal of Christian Syndicalism ought to be the protection of both poor peasants and smallholders - for if only class struggle is abandoned and re-examined can true labor equality be established. Lastly, there are more radical groups like the Catholic Worker Movement, galvanized by figures like Dorothy Day, which preaches that the solution to America’s ills is a combination of libertarian socialist and anarchist programmes unified under the trade unionist banner. Christian Syndicalism is not a recent invention by any means, yet it has found itself in a precarious position of needing to navigate a world in which their not-so-distant irreligious cousins have become both liberators and destroyers.

Having the same ancestry as ordinary National Syndicalists, that is in the Revolutionary realm of the Trade Unionist movement, the main proponents of Reformed National Syndicalist are the brothers Amilcare and Alceste De Ambris, with Alceste not only being the now increasingly disputed by Mussolini loyalists head of the Italian Labour Union, but also having gone through the long journey of organizing pro-war Fasci with Mussolini, co-authoring the Futurist Manifesto with Marinetti and even providing the ideological basis for most of D'Annunzio's short-lived Charter of Carnaro. The in a way counter-Charterists have been called to action by what they see as a long developing betrayal of the Syndicalist and Socialist ideals, ultimately resulting in crazed Totalitarianism bent on destruction of everything that they oppose, the Reformists instead often seek to return to the principles outlined exactly in such documents as Carnaro's, guaranteeing a model of collective sovereignty for all citizens regardless of sex, race, language, class, or religion, with institutions infused by Anarcho-Syndicalism and lessons from the cards of Urban Medieval Italian and Athenian Democratic history. To the proponents of the Reformed Charter, the forces of mainline Totalism became nothing more than a tool for the survival of the bourgeoisie through a surface-deep transformation afforded to it by nothing short of red-tinted national populists.

To many Nkrumaism is the first native African attempt to formulate a Marxist analysis of the conditions and solutions for the Black Continent's anti-imperialist struggle, but painting the work of Gold Coast's, as the colonials refer to it, great statesman would be a disservice to the deep richness which permeates the ideological foundation upon which his Convention People's Party aims to govern. Consciencism is, above all, a great display of syncretism, combining the Euro-Christian, Islamic and original African influences with the works of Karl Max, V.I. Lenin and many Black American and Caribbean thinkers the likes of George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, C.L.R. James, W.E.B. Du Bois and Father Divine just to name a few. According to Nkrumah's closest associates, his philosophy is a Socialism of a non-atheist kind, meant to implement what all true religions teach yet not supplant them. That is freedom, unity, dignity and the right to self-determination of all peoples, all emboldened by Consciencism's view that pre-colonial Africa was a long of communalism and egalitarianism, values which can be brought back despite the damage the European institutions wrecked upon them. The critics of Ghana's rising star argue that Nkrumaism is nothing more than a mere cult of personality, reliant on one-party democratic centralism and populist state ownership policies while dressing the purely Utopian nature of its socialism in the supposed trappings of 'Scientific' Marxian elements.

Cortés involvement ensures that themes thrust into the world through Modernism by Don Darío are still present, ones such as spiritually aristocratic cosmopolitanism, pride in the Latin American identity yet in respect of the Native inhabitants of these lands, and use of mythological and sensual themes in consideration of how to shape society. Pallais, as a dissident priest suspended by the conservative Church establishment over his social Catholic activism among the poor and destitute communities represents the continuation of the liberal tendencies of many early Modernist creators. The most profound recent influence on Modernismo Nicaragüense, however, is de la Selva's interweaving of soft Syndicalist views into the mostly literature based movement, influenced by both his contact with the American Federation of Labor's leader Samuel Gompers and Frida Kahlo's partner Diego Rivera, together with expressed support for many actions of the government established by the great revolutionary Augusto César Sandino.

syn_anarchism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Anarchism)§!\n\nAnarchism is a diverse, primarily left-wing ideology calling for the abolishment or or near-abolishment of the state. Anarchism is, at its core, a movement against authority in its unjust forms, be it organizational, governmental, societal or religious in nature. To the anarchists, the destruction of hierarchies and institutions that perpetuate inequality among the people is the final goal, with the removal of capitalism and state control being the preferred means to achieve this final destination. To the libertarians who subscribe to the ideology, a society that is guided the least is a society that works the best, and anarchists of all strains place great importance on voluntary association, direct democracy, individual freedom and natural societal organization through decentralized communes, municipalities or councils. As can be expected of such an anti-authoritarian ideology, it has naturally blossomed into many distinct forms of ideological thought, from the individualist anarchists following the ideas of Max Stirner to the mutualists of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon all the way to the platformists of Peter Arshinov or the collectivist anarchists of Mikhail Bakunin. These ideas vary greatly in what part of the free society they place the emphasis on, with Proudhon calling for a society of the artisan and free workers who will form federations and small-holdings of their own, creating an anarchist free market of sorts. This is also somewhat supported by the American branch of individualist anarchists, who denounced the tyranny of unjustly acquired capital but not necessarily the ownership of property. Others, such as Bakunin and Arshinov, emphasized collective ownership, where a federation would instead be formed by communes or villages that will form the basic unit of a new anarchist society. The platformists of Arshinov developed this policy further by calling for a collective society to also establish its own committee that would organize the anarchist collective into a tight-knit society capable of resisting external threats, until such time that the revolution has progressed to a point where an evolution to voluntary association can be fully implemented. Anarchism has gone on to inspire various movements that synthesize anarchism with another existing left-wing movement, such as is the case with anarcho-communism or anarcho-syndicalism."

Left Nationalism, sometimes also called Left-Wing Nationalism, Social Nationalism or even Popular Nationalism by people more averse to outright Socialist thought, is a broad categorization of various movements that combine their uniquely national struggle with the desire to remake the image of their societies into a more equal and caring visage. The differences between various parties under this label tend to be quite striking when one takes a closer look at them, for the 'Left' part may be tantamount to total uprooting of traditional structures that have kept the people in shackles - thus advocating a turn towards true Socialism in cultural and economic matters; or it may simply refer to a highly militant brand of progressivism that still upholds the vital role of the socialized market and some community-building institutions like religion. The 'Nationalist' part has been, similarly, interpreted quite widely, often falling out-of-balance into either the camp of ethnic, even racial, exceptionalism targeting very select groups or still upholding the civic-cultural tendency which was popular among the movements operating in multi-ethnic countries.

Similar Yellow unions quickly sprang up all over France before they were successfully federated by Pierre Biétry, who gave them a slogan: ‘Work, Family, Homeland’. Biétry also developed this form of unionism ideologically, rejecting the revolutionary approach that the workers' enemies were the bosses, he demonstrated that the real enemies of the French workers were the Boche and the Jew, cultivating a strong nationalism within his organization, receiving monetary support from many industrialists before the Revolution of 1919, with the goal of countering the much larger Red Syndicalist movement.

The movement is championed by Fred Maynard and the Australian Aboriginal Progressive Association, emerging as an offshoot of Garveyism introduced to Australia by African, Caribbean, and Indian seamen. The Sydney-based Garveyite organization, the Coloured Progressive Association, was formed in 1903 by these men, who spread Garvey's ideas among Aboriginal waterfront workers, leading to the modification to address the specific struggles of Indigenous Australians. The AAPA stands as the nation's first united and politically organized Aboriginal activist group, with a primary goal of ensuring that Indigenous affairs are managed by a proud and united Indigenous people. They advocate for the replacement of despotic Aboriginal Protection Boards with a management board composed of educated Aboriginals, with a chairman who would represent their people to the government. Additionally, the AAPA fights for Aboriginal citizenship, representation in parliament, or at least an ambassadorship to advocate for their rights. Central to their mission is securing land for Aboriginal families, grounded in the belief that Aboriginal people, as the original owners, have an inherent right to the land. These ideas have evolved through the revolution, with the AAPA working closely to unite the Aboriginal struggle with that of workers. Fred Maynard's active participation in the syndicalist Waterside Workers Federation of Australia exemplifies this solidarity, merging principles of Garveyist self-sufficiency, self-defense, and self-respect with the class solidarity inspired by his waterfront struggle.

Hinging around the practice of Satyāgraha - meaning ‘holding firmly to the truth’ or the Truth Force, which is the particular form of nonviolent or civil resistance employed by the Indian independence movement and other similar forces, Gandhists and the Satyagrahi utilize peaceful means to resist the governments, regimes, and policies they deem tyrannical in order to indirectly achieve progressive reform and societal change without needless bloodshed, only lashing out in self-defense when absolutely necessary as a life-saving last resort - though this self-defense clause is highly controversial with many followers of Mohandas K. Gandhi rejecting it in favor of total non-violence or Ahimsa. Additionally, Gandhism teaches egalitarian religious unity, especially between Hindus and Muslims who long have ravaged the region with their violent rivalries (though the Mahātmā created these unifying ideas through a Hindu lens with Brahmacharya in mind while his friend Abdul Ghaffar Khan did so through a Muslim lens with the Pashtunwali in mind), while also fostering nonviolent passions of patriotism and varied breeds of nationalism, upholding inalienable human rights and freedoms, and advocating for asceticism, fasting, and vegetarianism or veganism. Economically, Gandhism espouses the need for simple living, self-sufficiency, and import substitution on an agrarian platform that would focus on meeting the material needs of its citizenry before focusing on wealth generation or industrialization, while also pulling from the utopian anarchism and pacifist progressivism of Socialist thinkers like Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. Though shunned as a term by its ‘creators’ and not a true ideology in the eyes of the Mahātmā or Sarhadi Gandhi, Gandhism is nonetheless a strong political, cultural, and spiritual influencer across Southern Asia and beyond as Gandhians across the globe stand up for peaceful progress without resorting to violence outside self-defense."

It began life when Ángel Pestaña, alongside 29 other anarchists of the CNT-FAI, published a so called Manifest of the Thirty, which harshly criticized the actions of the CNT-FAI and its radical leaders, such as Buanaventura Durruti. This manifesto would eventually lead to a splitting of the anarchist movement, and Ángel Pestaña’s wing first implemented ideas of possibilist libertarianism in action. Possibilist libertarianism aims to legitimize anarcho-syndicalist ideas in a non-revolutionary way, seeking to implement their policies through the framework of a liberal democracy, usually in a wide popular front with other socialist, syndicalist and social democratic parties. While the eventual aims of the possibilist libertarians remain largely the same as those of their more radical comrades, such as the abolishment or heavy decentralization of the Spanish state and abandoning capitalism in favour of syndicalist principles, worker’s co-operation and communal decision making, it is considerably more moderate in its actions and doesn’t see trade unions as the main nucleus of anarcho-syndicalist action. Due to Pestaña’s experiences during the Russian civil war, Possibilist libertarianism is highly anti-authoritarian, opposing both left and right-wing forms of totalitarianism vehemently. While the ideology is mostly limited to the Partido Sindicalista formed by Pestaña and his close ally Benito Pabón, it also had some sway within CNT-FAI through anarchist Horacio Martínez Prieto, and in some ways, among the ranks of Federación Sindicalista Libertaria."

Anarcho-Abertzalism instead focuses on the Basque language and wider culture as a unifying factor, and often supporters of the ideology align with other left-wing nationalists such as the Eusko Alderli Sozialista. Heavily militant and disconnected from rest of Iberian anarchism, the movement is denounced by more mainline anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists of CNT-FAI and the Commune of France for aligning so closely with statist parties and movements, but it has gained quite a bit of traction among the less ideologically dogmatic members of the Biscayan and Gipuzkoan anarchists, who often associate more with the Basque people and tradition than the wider ideas of anarchism."

This has, naturally, led Council Communists to establish new trade unions independent from the traditional ones, seen as merely a frontist mirage spun by an alliance of capitalist bourgeoisie and their reformist social democratic allies. Although these positions may suggest Councilism holds certain similarities with Revolutionary Syndicalism or Leninist Marxism, even sometimes borrowing industrial unionism and the concept of a one big union from the former and praising the efforts of the latter, it rejects those currents on specific ideological grounds. The Syndicalists often maintain bourgeois structures of power and unionism, creating “degenerated laborist states”, while orphans of Bolshevism would throw away the rule of the workers in favor of a new elite emerging from the vanguard party, enforcing its authority through state socialism. Ultimately, Council Communists are a diverse group of politicians and theoreticians, such as Anton Pannekoek, Herman Gorter, Otto Rühle, Sylvia Pankhurst, Paul Mattick; all of whom had to, at certain points, accept the necessary and temporary nature of states and political parties, although just as a stepping stone towards the propagation of class conscious proletariat ready to take the government into their own hands."

Originating in Brazzaville, the capital of the old French equatorial colony, in the wake of Germany’s subsumption of France’s African colonies into Mittelafrika, Matswanisme is fiercely anti-imperialist at its core as it resists cultural degradation, socioeconomic inequality, and political oppression wrought at the hands of the colonial powers, with Matswa dreaming of an independent and pro-labor Congolese state for he and his people to call their own, even if pushing for such a dream lands him in a colonial prison as it has numerous times already. Propagated by Matswa’s own political association the Société Amicale des Originaires de l'Afrique Equatoriale Française, and holding friendly ties to the French Commune’s pro-indigenist figures spread across different Syndicalist, Communist, and Socialist groups, Matswanisme is rooted in Leftist ideology and grassroots populism, with Matswa himself and these allies long working to popularize and empower black-based trade unions and other socialist programmes across French Congo while dodging colonial security forces and roadblocks put in place by their new German overlords. This unabated desire to help the downtrodden masses at any cost and his willingness to openly resist the colonial system when little else would also fueled the most unique aspect of Matswanisme - its innate spirituality - for Matswa had begun to unintentionally garner a sort of quasi-religious aura in the eyes of downtrodden masses of Equatorial Africa, for they saw him as their own anti-imperialist messiah sent here by either the Christian God or some Teke spirit to free them from colonialism in a similar way to how their neighbors in the Belgian Congo see the infamous prophet Simon Kimbangu, although Matswa himself does not lean nearly as heavily into this messianic image as Kimbangu or other similar modern anti-imperialist prophets like Simon-Pierre Mpadi of Congo or William Wadé Harris of Liberia do. However, despite this strange quasi-messianic angle and its openly Left-leaning attitude, that has not stopped other local politicians from trying to hitch their identity and public perception to the popularity of Matswa and his messianic reputation, causing some aspects of Matswanisme, honestly or not, to bleed into the platforms of other French Congo politicians across the political spectrum, which only further fuels ideas of Matswa’s supposed divinity among the masses."

Inspired by Medieval English craft organizations, ideas of Social Democratic Federation’s poet William Morris, Fabian Society and the co-operative movement, the progenitors of the ideology such as Arthur Penty or S. G. Hobson and other associates within 'The New Age' magazine created a distinct branch of labour politics. Despite the initial aversion to factory production and hopes of a return to artisanal production organised through guilds, with further development by the stalwart that was George Douglas Howard Cole’s National Guilds League, this subset of Libertarian Socialist thinking clarified and came to a unified position. Society must be transformed into a system of participatory democracy based on basic units of workplace and community, the guilds, where tyranny would be averted through the state’s delegation of authority. While the final nature of future society is still hotly debated, ranging from a reformist nation that guarantees consumers’ rights and civil liberty to a federalized system of local structures, the supremacy of ownership by national guilds is always upheld. Even as its popularity waxed and waned, Guild Socialist remained influential among ambitious thinkers across the globe thanks to figures like: Olaf Stapledon - a science fiction writer envisioning an individualistic form of the ideology for the future of a unified mankind, America’s educator John Dewey, and Ernst Wigforss; leading theorist of the revisionist camp inside the Swedish Social Democracy."

Inspired by a present given to him by another very close representative of the Grupo dos Cinco, Tarsila do Amaral, Andrade would shape the vision of a 'Caraíba revolution' gazing at Abaporu, the man that eats people. The Anthropophagic Movement, thus, tackles the challenges of Brazil being a nation without its own distinct culture, always split between the colonized Indigenous and the colonizer Europeans, something that can be rectified by 'swallowing' of other cultures. Just like cannibalism took on a ritual nature in native societies, absorbing the best of strong warriors, so too shall the land nourished by the Amazon devour foreign inspirations and return them as something uniquely Brazilian. Thus, the taboo of the Indian is transformed into a totem, around which that of the West, Portugal, Europe, and white culture is cleverly digested by the inhabitants of this land. The 'meridian religions' which gave rise to Christianity or emphasis on 'correcting' Brazil’s unique language are rejected, while the works of thinkers like Marx, Freud, Breton, Montaigne, and Rousseau are analyzed and incorporated. Only time will tell if this avant-garde group can achieve a fundamental reshaping of the society in which they operated, or if other socialists shall tolerate their vision at all, but one thing is known. Movimento Antropofágico will continue their mission of inspiring new generations with an uncompromised sense of irony, as exemplified in the Manifesto’s quote: 'I asked a man what law was.

For the technocratic tendency within Socialism is often born out of the very material understanding of the world through the use of the political ideology, although some say pure science of Marx, developed by the Father of Communism and further expanded upon by a diverse group of thinkers. The most important of the groups fitting such a descriptor is the Bolshevik 'Proletkult', the 'Proletarian Culture' movement having its origins in the ideological Vpered, or 'Forward', faction of their party. Led by the coalition of Anatoly Lunacharsky, a close friend of V.I. Lenin and the People's Commissar of Education during the Revolution, Alexander Bogdanov, one of Lenin's greatest rivals for a time and the man around whom the original Vpered coalesced, and Valerian Polyansky, editor-in-chief of proletarian literature and progenitor of Soviet censorship. The main principle of the Proletkult is their devotion to progress and ardent 'religious' belief in the collective society and Scientific Socialism, a construct which gave birth to the Proletarian Religion and the 'God-Building' principle. Based on the Auguste Comte's 'Religion of Humanity' the Proletkultists deify the Socialist Enlightenment given form as a new faith, one capable of replacing the corrupt old lore of the dying bourgeoisie world, a plane in which even immorality may be achieved according to A. Bogdanov and his experiments with blood transfusion. Another important thinker of the Proletkult, although distinct from the Lunacharsky group, is Aleksei Gastev. Proponent of a Syndicalist-Technocratic Soviet system breaking with the orthodox Leninist tradition, Gastev is the creator of the 'Ustanovka' concept, aiming to install a revolutionary mental attitude within Russia through the use of social engineering and scientific management drawing upon the works of Frederick Taylor.

Many left-wing Christians believe capitalism to be idolatrous and rooted in the sin of greed, often identifying the wider cause of social inequality to be this sin, and as such Capitalism and other similar systems that rely on unequal power structures are seen as antithetical to what it means to be a true Christian. Usually secular in that Christianity is meant to be used as inspiration and a vehicle for doing social good without forcing the faith upon people in exchange for aid and without proselytizing of any kind, Christian Socialists instead point to the Christian past and gospel for inspiration on how to live in the present and future, citing things like the New Testament, the Church Father’s Age of Basil of Caesarea, and even the Old Testament as early examples of functioning socialist systems operating in harmony under Christ. In the modern age, Christian Socialism initially began to flourish in the 19th century across Europe and North America, particularly among Catholics, Methodists, and Calvinists, but also among other sects, including certain Orthodox circles under figures like Father Gapon and Sergei Bulgakov. In the British Isles, its rise, or resurgence if counting groups like the Diggers and Levellers, was championed by Labor Party co-founder Keir Hardie, the famed thinker and art critic John Ruskin, the Fabian Society, and James Connolly who established Christian Socialism as a dominant force among Ireland’s Left. In France it was popularized by people like Philippe Buchez, in Italy with groups like the original Fasci Siciliani, and in North America by forces like Canada’s social gospel movement or Americans like the Quakers and the Bellamyists in New England, suffragists like Marion Howard Dunham, moderate anarchists like Adin Ballou, and the vibrant Christian Socialist movement centered in Utah around Myron W. Reed and Franklin Spencer Spalding, but Christian Socialism has since spread to be found in Leftist circles the world over. Tied to but distinct from more radical forms of Christian leftism, like the Christian Anarchism of Tolstoy or the Christian Communism that Marx and Engels wrote of, and from more moderate forms like Christian social democracy rooted in ideas we also take from like Catholic Social Teachings, Liberation theology, Personalism from figures like Valentin Sventsitsky, and other humanitarian Christian schools of thought, Christian Socialists walk a middle path between theology and ideology, adapting ideas from all corners of the Christian Left while seeking to unite two worlds commonly at odds with one another by attempting to prove they were never really that different to begin with."

anarchism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Anarchism)§!\n\nAnarchism is a diverse, primarily left-wing ideology calling for the abolishment or or near-abolishment of the state. Anarchism is, at its core, a movement against authority in its unjust forms, be it organizational, governmental, societal or religious in nature. To the anarchists, the destruction of hierarchies and institutions that perpetuate inequality among the people is the final goal, with the removal of capitalism and state control being the preferred means to achieve this final destination. To the libertarians who subscribe to the ideology, a society that is guided the least is a society that works the best, and anarchists of all strains place great importance on voluntary association, direct democracy, individual freedom and natural societal organization through decentralized communes, municipalities or councils. As can be expected of such an anti-authoritarian ideology, it has naturally blossomed into many distinct forms of ideological thought, from the individualist anarchists following the ideas of Max Stirner to the mutualists of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon all the way to the platformists of Peter Arshinov or the collectivist anarchists of Mikhail Bakunin. These ideas vary greatly in what part of the free society they place the emphasis on, with Proudhon calling for a society of the artisan and free workers who will form federations and small-holdings of their own, creating an anarchist free market of sorts. This is also somewhat supported by the American branch of individualist anarchists, who denounced the tyranny of unjustly acquired capital but not necessarily the ownership of property. Others, such as Bakunin and Arshinov, emphasized collective ownership, where a federation would instead be formed by communes or villages that will form the basic unit of a new anarchist society. The platformists of Arshinov developed this policy further by calling for a collective society to also establish its own committee that would organize the anarchist collective into a tight-knit society capable of resisting external threats, until such time that the revolution has progressed to a point where an evolution to voluntary association can be fully implemented. Anarchism has gone on to inspire various movements that synthesize anarchism with another existing left-wing movement, such as is the case with anarcho-communism or anarcho-syndicalism."

This economic goal being achievable through organizations such as cooperatives or through the ownership of economic assets by the democratic state. Indeed, to be socialist, the state must be democratic, as Bertrand Russell describes the essence of Socialism as ‘by definition the demand for common ownership of land and capital. Common ownership may mean ownership by a democratic state, but it does not include ownership by any undemocratic state’. Emile Durkheim, who differentiates between authoritarian and democratic Socialism, characterizes Democratic Socialism as one that provides for constant dialogue between the state and economic groups, within the framework of a respected and clearly defined balance of power. As a general rule, Democratic Socialism seeks to combine a system of representative democracy with a truly socialist economy, distinguishing itself from the Communists, who want to make the Party the true holder of power instead of the state institutions, from the Syndicalists, who base their political system on the trade unions, and from the Social Democrats, who have abandoned the socialist objective in favor of the creation of a so-called ‘pink’ or ‘soft’ Capitalism. Some organizations, although similar in their political and economic demands, use the label of 'Moderate Socialist' instead of Democratic Socialist, although such a difference may seem minimal, these groups generally use less of the usual rhetoric and imagery of the workers' movement, such as the Red Flag or the International.

To remedy this the future government must, according to NSP's leader writings created together with the economist Nikolay Kondratiev, implement the 'New Economic Policy' leading to a gradual transition towards Socialism. This would be achieved through state regulation of a mixed economy using planned and market mechanisms, or 'Socialism in the City - Capitalism in the Village' as it was described during the party's foundational congress. While Bukharinism claims to represent 'True Leninism', it fluctuates between support for the Popular Front and its rejection in favor of the 'Party of the New Type', which has also led its proponents to differ on their stance towards trade unions, either championing their expansion or demanding their subservient transformation into production union."

Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as both a way of life and a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob - who resist collectivism while holding that their crimes are an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement in line with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no such moral basis. Additionally, the Expropriative Anarchists of Spain and Argentina, such as Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso, Severino Di Giovanni, and Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, hold similar views as both Illegalist cliques, but only see criminality as a means to a political end, not a way of life worth living past the Revolution’s success. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies by using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a Anarchist utopia."

The proponents of such a method reject the entirely stateless internationalist vision and once again turn towards the oft ignored 'National Question', pondering with renewed energy how to combine their ideology with the preservation or restoration of particular aspects of their native culture. The origins of National Communism can be found among the various minority activists within the Bolshevik movement, such as Ukraine's Vasyl Shakhrai, Tatarstan's Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev and Crimea's Ismail Firdevs, who became disillusioned with the continuation of cultural chauvinism so ever-present during the oppressive imperial era. Another important voice in the melding of national interests with communism, unrelated to the groups which operated within the Russian Communist Party, is the Borotbist movement led by Alexander Shumsky. National Communists carry the torch of Marx while noting that his position of workers having 'no country' refers to the globalized bourgeoisie states, machines for exploitation against which the policy of full independence or wide national autonomy in cooperation with new Socialist cores ought to be employed. For true Socialism, touching upon every aspect of local tradition, cannot be achieved unless the 'colonized' groups break the chains of their metropolitan masters. While to many Communists every National Communist represents a certain 'national deviation', the tendency itself does not merge its goals with explicit nationalism represented by the usual meaning of such a term. That is not to say certain groups do not increase their reliance on the 'national' part of their ideology. The National Communist term has also been applied to Marxist thinkers which do advocate an alliance with rabidly nationalistic and chauvinistic groups inside their nations, much to the chagrin of conventional representative of the ideology who call such positions 'Social-Reactionism', the most famous of them being the German Communist Heinrich Laufenberg, who developed the idea described by him as 'National Bolshevism'."

And thus, Mirskiy had to make broad coalition across the left side of the political spectrum, reaching out to Roman Jakobson of the Socialist Eurasianist Labour Party and elements within the Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries that are sympathetic towards Eurasianism. The result of such alliances was the foundation of Left Eurasianism as a political doctrine, incorporating elements of Panslavic internationalism, anti-clericalism combined with a respect for religion itself, Soviet based system including autonomous ethnic councils, Intellectual Avant-gardism. A diverse menagerie held together by the figure of the chairman, a certain 'Ceasar of October' serving as an heir to Lenin, who shall guide the renewed Eurasian nation towards a global revolution, crushing the bourgeoisie and liberating the friendly proletariats from their oppression."

bellamyism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Bellamyism)§!\n\nPertaining to the writings and theories put forth by the utopian author and activist Edward Bellamy, his cousin the Baptist minister and Christian socialist Francis Bellamy, and their followers the Bellamyites including figures like the suffragist Frances E. Willard, Bellamyism - or Bellamyite Thought - is a homegrown American form of Utopian Socialism tied to Saint-Simonism, arcadian agrarianism, secular Christian humanism, and communal cooperativism under a populist and progressive democratic society. First tested and popularized by various utopian communes and the short-lived Populist, or People’s, Party during the Gilded Age of American history using Bellamy’s many writings and his own newspaper ‘The New Nation’ as guidance, Bellamyism has since grown and expanded to become one of the dominant forms of American-made Socialism. Much of the ideology pulls from its founder's key philosophical works of literature that outlined Bellamy's plans for a truly utopian society, such as ‘Looking Backwards, 2000-1887’ and ‘Equality’ as well as from his own idealistic science fiction stories that dared to dream of a better world. The thought form is also linked to other ideas imagined by Bellamy such as payment cards replacing normal currency, his vaguely technocratic ideas centered around 'progressive engineers' and artisans guiding society, and most famously and foundationally of all, ‘nationalist clubs’ - or organized networks of Socialist political and socioeconomic groups working towards the nationalization of all industries and the land itself, along with the peaceful eradication of private property, in favor of communal ownership, all in order to eradicate competition and breed fair equality largely in a way similar to unions and leftist communalism while using a label less fear-inducing than Socialism and unionism to the American public. Bellamyism also champions the bleeding edge of social rights and progressive freedoms such as animal rights, wilderness preservation, reproductive rights, feminism, universal healthcare, absolute freedom of speech and expression with other personal freedoms and inalienable liberties included as well, and so much more. In all, Bellamyite Thought seeks to bring humanist, egalitarian, moral, environmentalist, and populist Socialism to all, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, while tempering society against our natural sins and vices in order to build a new utopia."

Practiced by pirate groups from the Great Lakes of America’s Rust Belt to the stormy seas of Southeast Asia, this strange and syncretic ideology seemingly inspired by old tales of the egalitarian pirate paradise Libertalia calls for the creation of a radical Leftist society free from state tyranny and oppressive theory, and supported socio-economically and culturally by piracy and other criminal acts, and in some cases also by dockworkers’ or fishermen organizations and other nautical unions of the local maritime industry. The varied movement is tied to ideas like Caponeism, Illegalism, Individualist Anarchism, Mobster Populism, Communalism, Syndicalism, nautical Unionism, and other fringe forms of Leftist or semi-Leftist ideology that rage against traditional statist and societal structures, and stands to uphold piracy and its many criminal facets and lifestyles as both the lifeblood of the economy and of their ‘theory’, which is largely spread through the propaganda of the deed and criminal action over any literature or organized doctrine.

Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."

This ideology combines the essence of Cossack identity and heritage with the principles of socialism, creating a distinct socialist system of governance. Drawing inspiration from national-oriented communist movements such as National-Communism, the Red Cossack Dictatorship emphasizes the importance of recognizing and preserving national and cultural peculiarities within the framework of Marxist and communist principles. It rejects cosmopolitanism and globalization, advocating instead for the preservation and autonomy of a Cossack culture. While the Red Cossack Dictatorship shares some similarities with military dictatorships, it maintains a distinctive leftist orientation and a focus on achieving socialist objectives. It may exhibit less authoritarianism and militarism compared to other socialist regimes. Some variations of this ideology may strive to establish socialism and maintain power until their vision of a just society is achieved, while others may allow for elections once reactionary forces are subdued.

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that both unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth, and protects the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things that is supported by traditional family values, feminism, education reform, and chastity while rejecting forms of spiritual elitism and societal laziness such as monasticism, medicantism, and asceticism, for self-exertion and service to humanity is paramount. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Initially organized by the sister writing duo Paulette and Jeanne Nardal of Martinique, and later expanded with the help of Martinican poète Aimé Césaire, the Senegalese thinkers Abdoulaye Sadji and Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Léon Damas of French Guiana along with others like Gilbert Gratiant, Leonard Sainville, Louis T. Achille, Aristide Maugée, Négritude at its core is a collaborative thoughtform that disavows colonialism, racism, imperialism, inequality, and Eurocentrism while promoting independent and revitalized African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties in order to remove any stigma against African civilization while uplifting the African diaspora to an equal position of comradery and cooperation with the rest of the world; all atop a base of Marxist political philosophy in the Black radical tradition - however non-Marxist forms of Socialism like Social Democratism, Syndicalism, National Syndicalism, and other more extremist Leftist offshoots have become more common as the ideologies of the Third Internationale and further Socialists abroad continue to mutate and influence the African continent, especially as the Afro-Surrealist artistic foundations of the Négritude movement fuse with European concepts of the surreal and the futuristic. Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique. Refuting the idea of African cultural assimilation or notions of Africa being any less civilized than the rest of the world, the Négritude movement seeks to put Francophonic Africa on the path to shining glory, sitting at the global table as united, or at least cooperating, equals with the rest of the world while making the concept of being Black, or Négre, something to only be proud of."

Taking from both Anarcho-Syndicalist and more traditional Marxist currents - particularly from the idealist, antipositivist, anti-evolutionist, and anti-materialist works of Italian thinkers like Antonio Gramsci and his theory of cultural hegemony, as well as from Benedetto Croce and Antonio Labriola, while also holding some similarities to Mexico’s own Far-Left pro-indigenists the Mexicayotl - Mariáteguismo offers a syncretic path forward for Peru’s indigenous souls while also caring for the larger Hispanicized population in a liberated system purged of imperialist corruption, anti-native sentiment, and the toxic Hispanicism that has led South America to ruin since the arrival of the Spanish. Mariáteguismo also curiously holds links to Peru’s avant-garde, with early Mariáteguist works being penned alongside Mariátegui’s own close friend, the famed Peruvian writer and narrator Pedro Abraham Valdelomar Pinto, which has also led to some more foreign ideas of the avant-garde scene flowing in from Paris and Italy. Citing the idea that Peru under the Inca and the other pre-Columbian tribes was a communalist, even proto-socialist network of societies built around collectivism and mass obedience to a shared social duty, Mariáteguismo believes that ‘The Conquest’ or the invasion of the Conquistadors triggered a split not only in our history, but our economics as well with the invading Europeans forcing us into a feudalist system that has only eroded Peru’s native culture and identity in the centuries since. Rejecting the corrupted law of Gamonalism, or ‘Bossism’, innate to the post-colonial bureaucracies of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, while refuting any deals and treaties they forced on past native groups, Mariáteguism seeks to undo the damage these many centuries of pro-European elitism, corruption, and capitalism has wrought on the Andes by tearing down the old order, divorcing the central government from the clutches of the gamonal, nationalizing the various resources and industries founded by natives that were later stolen and expanded by these gamonalists once and for all, and in general creating a revolutionary new Socialist state based along Marxist and Syndicalist syncretic lines, all in tune with the pro-indigenism and autonomous communalism of Mariáteguis himself."
radsoc_liberal_socialism_subtype:0 "Liberal Socialism"

This synthesis uplifts currents of classical and radical liberalism along with their idea that Liberalism innately is the sole political theory that truly takes the inner freedom of the human spirit into account as a given while adopting liberty as the goal, means, and rule of shared human life, thus putting the rights and needs of every individual citizen above all else instead of relying on some detached, state-driven goal or a ‘for the greater good’ mentality common in more traditional Marxist circles. Instead of compromising this idea of perfected liberty with socialist concepts, Liberal Socialism dictates that Socialism is not the end all be all, but more so is seen as the tool or method necessary to realize this recognition of liberty through political and economic autonomy and society-wide emancipation from the grip of pressing material necessity. Refusing to abolish capitalism with a socialist economy, instead supporting a mixed economy and broad economic syncretism that includes both social ownership and private property in capital goods, Liberal Socialism walks a middle path between revolution and reform, liberalism and socialism, in order to create a true society of liberty for all."

christian_anarchism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Christian Anarchism)§!\n\nChristian Anarchism is a strain of anarchist thought that claims that anarchistic principles are inherent within Christianity and the Gospels, with some radical members even claiming that Jesus Christ himself was the first true Anarchist. Grounded in the belief that there is only one source of authority that any and all Christians are ultimately answerable to - being God himself and his wider teachings embodied in Jesus Christ - this specific breed of Leftism believes that it is only moral, pious, and just to reject all other forms of earthly authority such as the State, seeing these sources of human-based authority to be innately violent, deceitful, unjust, and idolatrous. Furthermore, Christian Anarchism holds that the concept of a ‘Kingdom of God’ - or more broadly the creation of a pious stateless society bound by humanistic and egalitarian Christian social teachings - is the only proper expression of the relationship between God and humanity, characterizing human relationships under such a ‘Kingdom’ by horizontal organization, servant leadership, and universal compassion, and not through the traditional, and often oppressive, structures of organized religion, which most Christian anarchists consider hierarchical and or otherwise authoritarian in nature. Additionally, most Christian Anarchists are also pacifists who reject war, militarism, and the use of violence even if revolutionary in nature, though their economic ideas and proclivity to industrial urbanism and Syndicalisms or agrarian ruralism and Anarchist Democracy can vary, though most Christian Anarchist movements pull heavily from the Leo Tolstoy’s ‘The Kingdom of God is Within You’ as well as the Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount of the Bible. Overall, Christian Anarchists believe in one God and one master in Heaven while rejecting all other forms of authority, hierarchy, inequality, and statism borne from earthly or human sources in order to build an egalitarian and free communalist society under God. Among the most popular existing movements espousing Christian Anarchism today are the Catholic Worker Movement organized by the American social activist Dorothy Day and Nomadelfia, a community situated within the territory of the Papal States established by father Zeno Saltini."

Putting forth that the only tax should be on land value, for taxing the economic rent only leads to inefficiencies and exploitation, Georgism is primarily concerned with economics, but has since been tied to ideas ranging from Syndicalism and Progressivism to Democratic Socialism and Left Libertarianism to certain strains of Anarchism and even non-Socialist ideologies in more Rightist and Centrist circles.

The thoughtform was first officialized and outlined in Marinetti's Manifesto del Futurismo with help from other artists who worked alongside Marinetti in the original futurist group formerly centered in Milan, like Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. The movement at its core is an artistically-driven rejection of the past that seeks to unshackle the nation from any former identity in order to actualize the realization of a perfected future form, with Italian Futurism specifically glorifying modernity and the possibility and motion of an unknown and aesthetically-evolved future over any common sources of Italian traditionalism like the Renaissance or the Romans, with the goal to liberate Italy from the weight of its past entirely so as to fly into the boundless possibly of tomorrow. Despite being one of the most famous interventionist proponents alongside Benitto Mussolini, with whose National Revolutionary Bloc Marinetti has aligned after the establishment of the Socialist Republic, the unique 'Futurist Political Party' has outlined its own truly revolutionary programme separate from the likes of Charterist National-Syndicalism. In their political manifesto 'Democrazia Futurista', followers of the great artist have called for violent and precise anti-clericalism, abolition of the military in favour of light volunteer force, destruction of marriage in favour of nationalized upbringing of children and tax on free love, mass de-bureaucratization, full equality between the genders, Georgist inspired land reform, and a system of proportional reprensenation leading to the election of a technical one chamber government constituted by twenty members under 30 years of age representing all important social strata fairly. With all of their proposals, the Left Futurists aim to tear down the current order full of criminals and reactionaries both on the Right and on the Left, and where socialists and anarchists have always refused to wage war, in order to bring about 'the only hygiene of the world' as the Futurists have termed it. Although their nature is highly egalitarian and opposed to totalitarian modes of state, in recent years - owing to the shape Italy has found itself in - a radical wing centered around long-time Futurist Giuseppe Bottai has begun to grow, borrowing much from the National-Syndicalists and aligning with foreign supremacist movements."

Sharing the argument that systems were made for men, and not the other way around, that its predecessor was formed around, Leftist Social Credit seeks to bend financial rules and mainstays along with the very notion of an ideological spectrum in order to ensure absolute socio-economic security for its populace, though the ideology is still split between more egalitarian and broad humanitarian cliques like those seen in the Ireland, or in places the United States with Robert Heinlein and New Zealand with John A.

In recent years 'Jermanism' began to coalesce into a semi-concrete form of ideology, due to the influence of neighbouring leftist groups like the ones in India or China, and thus began advocating for separation of religion and state while still respecting the right to worship, council communalism in a semi-anarchist organization of the state, full removal of the hierarchical backwardness steeped in Kazi dominated class system, ecological and agrarian socialism, incorporating existing tribal structures into the functions of a modernized state and most importantly creating a cohesive syncretic culture uniting all of the diverse groups that call Sikkim their home into one 'Sikkimese' identity.

To many Nkrumaism is the first native African attempt to formulate a Marxist analysis of the conditions and solutions for the Black Continent's anti-imperialist struggle, but painting the work of Gold Coast's, as the colonials refer to it, great statesman would be a disservice to the deep richness which permeates the ideological foundation upon which his Convention People's Party aims to govern.

Vardamanism fights against the South's aristocratic elite, just as the Governor did against LeRoy Percy, champions trade unionism and work laws ending child labor and improving general conditions, a sweeping reform to both mental health institutions and the ghastly penal system are proposed, education is upheld through the creation of a united board overseeing and reforming the system while fundamental human rights are enshrined into law and prohibition is assured. JKV also stands out from among the conservative culture by championing female suffrage and full equality between the genders, for White women are not only equal but even higher intellectual and physically than men, condemning anti-Semitism of the likes that Ford and his ilk peddles, striving against the use of American Patriotism for political gains and being strongly anti-imperialist, calling for the world to be free. Despite that, and even his actions to ensure a fair trial for them, Vardaman is known as the 'Great White Chief' that would 'lynch every black to ensure White supremacy' for a very clear reason, defending Jim Crow vehemently while calling the suffrage of Negros a mistake thrust upon a lower form of being. This ideological contrast, also seen in his reverence for both Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln, is furiously accepted by the 'Rednecks', poor labourers wearing red scarfs, as well as many others organizing local Vardaman Clubs to read the Senator's papers and champion the visionary aims of their messiah."

Uplifting one or a few specific cultures in Europe, or uplifting them all into a cohesive whole, the ‘nationalist’ aspect of Left Pan-European thought can vary greatly as different groups push cultural nationalism, civic nationalism, ethnic nationalism, or other identities to rally around and divide by.

Hinging around the practice of Satyāgraha - meaning ‘holding firmly to the truth’ or the Truth Force, which is the particular form of nonviolent or civil resistance employed by the Indian independence movement and other similar forces, Gandhists and the Satyagrahi utilize peaceful means to resist the governments, regimes, and policies they deem tyrannical in order to indirectly achieve progressive reform and societal change without needless bloodshed, only lashing out in self-defense when absolutely necessary as a life-saving last resort - though this self-defense clause is highly controversial with many followers of Mohandas K. Gandhi rejecting it in favor of total non-violence or Ahimsa. Additionally, Gandhism teaches egalitarian religious unity, especially between Hindus and Muslims who long have ravaged the region with their violent rivalries (though the Mahātmā created these unifying ideas through a Hindu lens with Brahmacharya in mind while his friend Abdul Ghaffar Khan did so through a Muslim lens with the Pashtunwali in mind), while also fostering nonviolent passions of patriotism and varied breeds of nationalism, upholding inalienable human rights and freedoms, and advocating for asceticism, fasting, and vegetarianism or veganism. Economically, Gandhism espouses the need for simple living, self-sufficiency, and import substitution on an agrarian platform that would focus on meeting the material needs of its citizenry before focusing on wealth generation or industrialization, while also pulling from the utopian anarchism and pacifist progressivism of Socialist thinkers like Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. Though shunned as a term by its ‘creators’ and not a true ideology in the eyes of the Mahātmā or Sarhadi Gandhi, Gandhism is nonetheless a strong political, cultural, and spiritual influencer across Southern Asia and beyond as Gandhians across the globe stand up for peaceful progress without resorting to violence outside self-defense."

Ryutin believes that the forces advocating quicker industrialization and chauvinistic centralism were not properly kept in check by the majority of the party, and thus the current doctrinal focus has to be reconsidered. Thus, among the key tenets of Ryutinism is reassigned emphasis on the rural communities and greater outreach towards the minorities of the Union, ones willing to excel in a newly minted people's meritocracy. Yet the most vital aspect of the ideology is a realization that true Socialism and the will of V.I. Lenin can only be preserved by existing as part of the Capitalism World, for it has triumphed over many crises and laid bare the shortcomings of purely Communistic states. That's why a new approach, a combined socio-economic advance of the Market and Leninism shall ensure the progress and prosperity of the entire proletariat. Thus, the policies of 'Capitalism in the Village' shall be extended and also replace the 'Socialism in the City', galvanizing the owner class to build up the country's advancement while creating competition for the state's capitalistic experiments. Despite such a turn it does not mean the lowest classes shall be abandoned, quite the opposite. For the rich shall be overseen by the administration to ensure they uphold the ideals of philanthropy and strive to create urban cooperatives amongst the workers.

While a member of the Russian Communist Party during the Civil War and one of the leaders of the Muslim Socialist Committee of Kazan, Soltanğäliev became concerned with the problem of the replacement of the exploiter imperial core, led by bourgeoisie, with the international proletariat which could devolve to the same role. According to him, only through a united dictatorship of the 'colonies and half-colonies' over the 'metropole' can the chains that bind the oppressed nations, such as the entire Muslim world, be finally broken. Despite combining that view with the position that dialectical materialism was developed not only in Europe, but also in the nations of the East, thus rejecting mindless copying of everything the Occidental Marxists transport onto his world, Mirsäyet is entirely willing to accept a unified front with the poor masses of all of Russia to bring true Socialism about. To that extent the creation of a Tatar-Bashkir Soviet Republic, or even pan-Turania governed by the rules of democratic centralism, is meant as either an autonomous ally of the Russian Socialist Republic, or even the final reserve of the Revolution guarding against the renewed bourgeoisie from the imperial core, trying to destroy the Tatar identity, as well as the reactionaries of China and India. Just like the Jadidists, to which his father belong, are concerned with the reform of their Islamic societies so does Soltanğäliev outline an extensive plan for progress within the Muslim world. To the Tatar revolutionary the term 'Muslim' refers to a shared cultural background, and not a religion meant to be preserved for he still adhered to the Marxist doctrine of atheism. Yet the method in which Islam ought to be fought has to be different from combating Christianity, for the youngest Abrahamic faith already upholds many aspects compatible with orthodox Communism while suffering from a high degree of clerical influence. Due to such mix of views Soltangalievism serves as a paramount example for both nascent Marxist colonial liberation movements so concerned with the fight against the metropolitan masters, especially inside the Muslim world, as well as the thinkers espousing National Communism."

Emerging from the most radical sections of pro-Carlist student associations such as the Navarre branch of the Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista who once flirted with Sorelianism, and supported by the few reform-minded scholars and politicians of the movement, these self-proclaimed Left Carlists’ main concern is a total reformation of the organization from its traditionally autocratic and ultraconservative shackles that held the movement back from modern-day monarchism. Taking influence from both moderate Christian socialist movements such as the Sicilian-based NeoFasci, Dorothy Days’ Catholic Workers’ Movement and other Christian-democratic socialist models around the world, as well as more radically communist and syndicalist workers’ self management models adopted by Bukharin, Josip Broz, Karl Renner, Otto Bauer and more, those who are identified by the appellation advocated for a pluralist yet still pious Christian socialist democracy, led by a reformed mass-based Carlist democratic party, fusing democratic socialism, regional autonomism and constitutional monarchism into a cohesive ideological platform for Spanish rejuvenation, while uniting the many disparaging ethnic groups of Spain into one harmonous whole.\n\nHowever, for all their radicalism, Catholicism remained as a guiding principle of those who identify with this emerging tendency, as well as suspicions to outright disdain of modern liberal principles in favour of Catholic personalism and Christian democracy.

Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives.

Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century.

It seeks to break down the barriers towards progress, internationalism, peace and equality through a common language giving workers a means to connect and organize more freely. Worker’s movements created around Esperanto started springing up all around Europe prior to the Weltkrieg, but these groups were usually local affairs and gained relatively little actual traction. The first such movement with a clear international aim was Internacia Asocio Paco-Libereco, started by Fernand Blangarin and R.Louis, with the aims of spreading internationalism and anti-capitalist ideas through the artificial language, though IAPL was mainly limited to France and similar aims of different Esperantists also died off with little success before the Weltkrieg. After the Weltkrieg, the proclamation of Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda would see this movement revitalize, and Esperanto socialism rose back to prominence with the new syndicalist power bloc,Third Internationale, pursuing a very internationalist foreign policy. Esperanto socialists, anarchists and communists would work alongside their syndicalist brethren to spread the ideas of global worker’s solidarity, anationalism and resistance to the evils of capitalism. The commitment to rejection of nationalism is evident especially in the organization of SAT’s congresses, where delegated to the General Council or Ĝenerala Konsilantaro are chosen out of sectors of the world, not from nations themselves. Still, the Esperanto worker’s movement is more than its most famous representative group, and local implementations of Esperanto into the wider proletarian organization can lead to very varied results, sometimes even including a degree of nationalism depending on the needs of the situation at hand. To the Esperanto socialists, the language is a tool to overcome difficulties over national or regional barriers, but also a beloved carrier of culture and ideology that only continues to evolve alongside other streams of international socialism."

Councilists believe that the downfall of capitalism is inevitable, and the engine of the revolution can only be maintained through the emergence of independent and autonomous workers’ councils and organizations, ultimately ushering in the Dictatorship of the Proletariat through mass strikes and other forms of industrial action. This has, naturally, led Council Communists to establish new trade unions independent from the traditional ones, seen as merely a frontist mirage spun by an alliance of capitalist bourgeoisie and their reformist social democratic allies. Although these positions may suggest Councilism holds certain similarities with Revolutionary Syndicalism or Leninist Marxism, even sometimes borrowing industrial unionism and the concept of a one big union from the former and praising the efforts of the latter, it rejects those currents on specific ideological grounds. The Syndicalists often maintain bourgeois structures of power and unionism, creating “degenerated laborist states”, while orphans of Bolshevism would throw away the rule of the workers in favor of a new elite emerging from the vanguard party, enforcing its authority through state socialism. Ultimately, Council Communists are a diverse group of politicians and theoreticians, such as Anton Pannekoek, Herman Gorter, Otto Rühle, Sylvia Pankhurst, Paul Mattick; all of whom had to, at certain points, accept the necessary and temporary nature of states and political parties, although just as a stepping stone towards the propagation of class conscious proletariat ready to take the government into their own hands."

Propagated by Matswa’s own political association the Société Amicale des Originaires de l'Afrique Equatoriale Française, and holding friendly ties to the French Commune’s pro-indigenist figures spread across different Syndicalist, Communist, and Socialist groups, Matswanisme is rooted in Leftist ideology and grassroots populism, with Matswa himself and these allies long working to popularize and empower black-based trade unions and other socialist programmes across French Congo while dodging colonial security forces and roadblocks put in place by their new German overlords. This unabated desire to help the downtrodden masses at any cost and his willingness to openly resist the colonial system when little else would also fueled the most unique aspect of Matswanisme - its innate spirituality - for Matswa had begun to unintentionally garner a sort of quasi-religious aura in the eyes of downtrodden masses of Equatorial Africa, for they saw him as their own anti-imperialist messiah sent here by either the Christian God or some Teke spirit to free them from colonialism in a similar way to how their neighbors in the Belgian Congo see the infamous prophet Simon Kimbangu, although Matswa himself does not lean nearly as heavily into this messianic image as Kimbangu or other similar modern anti-imperialist prophets like Simon-Pierre Mpadi of Congo or William Wadé Harris of Liberia do. However, despite this strange quasi-messianic angle and its openly Left-leaning attitude, that has not stopped other local politicians from trying to hitch their identity and public perception to the popularity of Matswa and his messianic reputation, causing some aspects of Matswanisme, honestly or not, to bleed into the platforms of other French Congo politicians across the political spectrum, which only further fuels ideas of Matswa’s supposed divinity among the masses."

Described by some socialists as opportunists and by some liberals as hidden Syndicalists, no one can deny that Syndicalist-Aligned Social Democracy is a tendency that is becoming increasingly popular within many moderate social-democrat movements around the world."

socdem_democratic_socialism_subtype:0 "Democratic Socialism"
socdem_democratic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Democratic Socialism)§!\n\nThe notion of Democratic Socialism is a broad term referring to various groups and organizations whose aim, for the most part, is to combine the system of representative democracy based on universal suffrage, where citizens directly elect those holding positions of governance, with an economic system where common ownership would be more prevalent than that of the individual. This economic goal being achievable through organizations such as cooperatives or through the ownership of economic assets by the democratic state. Indeed, to be socialist, the state must be democratic, as Bertrand Russell describes the essence of Socialism as ‘by definition the demand for common ownership of land and capital. Common ownership may mean ownership by a democratic state, but it does not include ownership by any undemocratic state’. Emile Durkheim, who differentiates between authoritarian and democratic Socialism, characterizes Democratic Socialism as one that provides for constant dialogue between the state and economic groups, within the framework of a respected and clearly defined balance of power. As a general rule, Democratic Socialism seeks to combine a system of representative democracy with a truly socialist economy, distinguishing itself from the Communists, who want to make the Party the true holder of power instead of the state institutions, from the Syndicalists, who base their political system on the trade unions, and from the Social Democrats, who have abandoned the socialist objective in favor of the creation of a so-called ‘pink’ or ‘soft’ Capitalism."

To call the Kingfish's programme wide would be an understatement, for his ideological musings combine elements from all sides of the spectrum while tying them together with the aura of populism serving the common folk. Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary. Ultimately, the political creation of Huey Long is a personalist vehicle not unlike those in Southern America, being everything to his die-hard supporters, while willing to borrow and utilize any idea that will ensure continued dominance of the AFP, Huey Long and ensure that every man can be king."

Swearing to abolish poverty and exploitation of the working class and peasantry while expanding and safeguarding equal rights for all citizens, this syncretic movement seeks to unify the Italian people and heal the scars left by the collapse of the Nation.

The central tenet of Georgist philosophy states that although people should value what they themselves produce, the ‘economic rent’ - or all natural resources and other common goods of an area - must be owned equally by all members within a society. Putting forth that the only tax should be on land value, for taxing the economic rent only leads to inefficiencies and exploitation, Georgism is primarily concerned with economics, but has since been tied to ideas ranging from Syndicalism and Progressivism to Democratic Socialism and Left Libertarianism to certain strains of Anarchism and even non-Socialist ideologies in more Rightist and Centrist circles.

The differences between various parties under this label tend to be quite striking when one takes a closer look at them, for the 'Left' part may be tantamount to total uprooting of traditional structures that have kept the people in shackles - thus advocating a turn towards true Socialism in cultural and economic matters; or it may simply refer to a highly militant brand of progressivism that still upholds the vital role of the socialized market and some community-building institutions like religion. The 'Nationalist' part has been, similarly, interpreted quite widely, often falling out-of-balance into either the camp of ethnic, even racial, exceptionalism targeting very select groups or still upholding the civic-cultural tendency which was popular among the movements operating in multi-ethnic countries.

Supporters of agrarian parties range from large landowners or landed gentry to smallholders and poor farmers, from the lower high class through the most consistent support base among the middle class, and ending up on the lower classes. The origins of political agrarianism can be traced to the 'government of nature' developed by physiocrat and laissez-faire advocate François Quesnay, as well as the republic of rural virtue of Thomas Jefferson. While supporters of such parties hold the people of the land as a foundation of society and the most important part of the nation's organism, they differ wildly in their positions regarding economy, taxation, protectionism vs free trade, system of government, religion etc. Agrarian parties are generally conservative and traditionalist, although there is a sizeable contingent of radically liberal and downright socialistic groups, with some unconventional right-wingers mixed in-between. This wide range can be seen by looking at only a few rural movements, such as the German national revolutionary Landvolkbewegung or the conservative and monarchist Bund der Landwirte, the more centrist Czech RSZML or the Finnish Maalaisliitto, and even the radicals in terms of social changes such as Poland's PSL Wyzwolenia or Bulgaria's BZNS."

Many left-wing Christians believe capitalism to be idolatrous and rooted in the sin of greed, often identifying the wider cause of social inequality to be this sin, and as such Capitalism and other similar systems that rely on unequal power structures are seen as antithetical to what it means to be a true Christian. Usually secular in that Christianity is meant to be used as inspiration and a vehicle for doing social good without forcing the faith upon people in exchange for aid and without proselytizing of any kind, Christian Socialists instead point to the Christian past and gospel for inspiration on how to live in the present and future, citing things like the New Testament, the Church Father’s Age of Basil of Caesarea, and even the Old Testament as early examples of functioning socialist systems operating in harmony under Christ. In the modern age, Christian Socialism initially began to flourish in the 19th century across Europe and North America, particularly among Catholics, Methodists, and Calvinists, but also among other sects, including certain Orthodox circles under figures like Father Gapon and Sergei Bulgakov. In the British Isles, its rise, or resurgence if counting groups like the Diggers and Levellers, was championed by Labor Party co-founder Keir Hardie, the famed thinker and art critic John Ruskin, the Fabian Society, and James Connolly who established Christian Socialism as a dominant force among Ireland’s Left. In France it was popularized by people like Philippe Buchez, in Italy with groups like the original Fasci Siciliani, and in North America by forces like Canada’s social gospel movement or Americans like the Quakers and the Bellamyists in New England, suffragists like Marion Howard Dunham, moderate anarchists like Adin Ballou, and the vibrant Christian Socialist movement centered in Utah around Myron W. Reed and Franklin Spencer Spalding, but Christian Socialism has since spread to be found in Leftist circles the world over. Tied to but distinct from more radical forms of Christian leftism, like the Christian Anarchism of Tolstoy or the Christian Communism that Marx and Engels wrote of, and from more moderate forms like Christian social democracy rooted in ideas we also take from like Catholic Social Teachings, Liberation theology, Personalism from figures like Valentin Sventsitsky, and other humanitarian Christian schools of thought, Christian Socialists walk a middle path between theology and ideology, adapting ideas from all corners of the Christian Left while seeking to unite two worlds commonly at odds with one another by attempting to prove they were never really that different to begin with."

Often linked to ideas of Market Socialism, Christian Distributism, charity economics, Bismarck's State Socialism and economic interventionism, Red Toryism, and other wealth-sharing programs, Paternal Socialists seek to build egalitarian, non-predatory economic systems geared against ideas of class struggle that fuse Capitalist and Socialist ideas in a Consevative and Paternalistic package for the good of their usually traditionalist and nationalist peoples while undermining and weakening normal Socialist and Leftist movements to preserve tradition and societal stability, even if that puts them at odds with other Socialists or Conservatives around the globe."

Not innately tied to a specific ideological current, Reformist Belgicism is primarily concerned with reducing the political autonomy of the constituent halves of its union while promoting national syncretism and bilingualism, though oftentimes each individual movement will heavily favor either French or Dutch for ease or out of personal bias. Reformist Beglcisits are frequently paired with ideas of Roman Catholic piety, Social Catholicism or non-Revolutionary Socialist Welfare, Belgian Unitarianism, and the cultivation of a uniquely Belgian culture and identity, but the idea of a Belgian nationality is not inherently tied to any one political group, with ideas of Belgian statehood and cultural cohesion stretching far across the ideological and political spectrums of the Low Countries, from the Reformed and Humanitarian Rexists of Hergé to the Humanist Capitalists of Buisseret and the Socialist Belgicists of Dehousse."

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression.

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity. Despite their anti-Islamic slant, Pharaonists do not seek to ban Islam or other religions outright, instead pursuing Secularism as they work to build a society based on the former glories of Kemet and her proud people. Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as both a way of life and a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob - who resist collectivism while holding that their crimes are an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement in line with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no such moral basis. Additionally, the Expropriative Anarchists of Spain and Argentina, such as Buenaventura Durruti, Francisco Ascaso, Severino Di Giovanni, and Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, hold similar views as both Illegalist cliques, but only see criminality as a means to a political end, not a way of life worth living past the Revolution’s success. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies by using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a Anarchist utopia."

Calling for social safety nets and minimalist welfare systems, Progressive Conservatism seeks to improve society without radical or rapid changes to the established status quo and traditions, and is often tied to Catholic social teaching, Christian democracy, and even the papal literary work ‘Rerum novarum’ which calls for a form of Catholic conservative progressivism in order to safeguard the Christian working masses against the predation of Socialism.

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Achille, Aristide Maugée, Négritude at its core is a collaborative thoughtform that disavows colonialism, racism, imperialism, inequality, and Eurocentrism while promoting independent and revitalized African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties in order to remove any stigma against African civilization while uplifting the African diaspora to an equal position of comradery and cooperation with the rest of the world; all atop a base of Marxist political philosophy in the Black radical tradition - however non-Marxist forms of Socialism like Social Democratism, Syndicalism, National Syndicalism, and other more extremist Leftist offshoots have become more common as the ideologies of the Third Internationale and further Socialists abroad continue to mutate and influence the African continent, especially as the Afro-Surrealist artistic foundations of the Négritude movement fuse with European concepts of the surreal and the futuristic. Linked to similar ideas across the African diaspora, like those in Haiti such as the Noirisme, Haitian Indigenism and Kreyol pride, and to the rising concept of ‘black is beautiful’ among Afro-Caribbean Americans in New York City and the American Black Belt, Négritude represents the dominant form of such ideas across Françafrique. Refuting the idea of African cultural assimilation or notions of Africa being any less civilized than the rest of the world, the Négritude movement seeks to put Francophonic Africa on the path to shining glory, sitting at the global table as united, or at least cooperating, equals with the rest of the world while making the concept of being Black, or Négre, something to only be proud of."

Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered. Regardless, the Pan-Scandinavian dream must be achieved, and through equal cooperation and shared destiny, the dream of a peaceful and prosperous Scandinavia bound by our shared Nordic Spirit will be earned as the Three Sisters gradually grow closer and closer together."

liberal_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Liberal Socialism)§!\n\nLiberal Socialism is an ideology created and popularized largely within British and Italian circles that incorporates liberal democratic principles to non-Marxist socialism, as seen in British Labour and the writings of John Stuart Mill - who theorized that capitalist societies should experience a gradual process of socialization through worker-controlled enterprises that coexisted with private enterprises while rejecting centralized models of socialism that he thought might discourage competition and creativity, arguing that representation is essential in a free government and democracy could not subsist if economic opportunities were not well distributed, therefore conceiving democracy not just as a form of representative government but as an entire social organization that has since come to be the foundation of Liberal Socialist thought - or the Italian Action Party of Carlo Rosselli, though it has also seen success in other places across the Anglosphere and wider world, being similar to certain American concepts of non-Marxist libertarian socialism as well as the works of the French Catholic priest and educator Jean-Baptiste de La Salle. This synthesis uplifts currents of classical and radical liberalism along with their idea that Liberalism innately is the sole political theory that truly takes the inner freedom of the human spirit into account as a given while adopting liberty as the goal, means, and rule of shared human life, thus putting the rights and needs of every individual citizen above all else instead of relying on some detached, state-driven goal or a ‘for the greater good’ mentality common in more traditional Marxist circles. Instead of compromising this idea of perfected liberty with socialist concepts, Liberal Socialism dictates that Socialism is not the end all be all, but more so is seen as the tool or method necessary to realize this recognition of liberty through political and economic autonomy and society-wide emancipation from the grip of pressing material necessity. Refusing to abolish capitalism with a socialist economy, instead supporting a mixed economy and broad economic syncretism that includes both social ownership and private property in capital goods, Liberal Socialism walks a middle path between revolution and reform, liberalism and socialism, in order to create a true society of liberty for all."

In opposition to the monarchy-favouring liberals of Benedetto Croce and the dictatorial marxists of Antonio Gramsci, Concretismo combines secularist aspects from the Age of Enlightenment, liberalism and socialism. Salvemini has long rallied against the corrupt political machines specifically keeping the South poor in an effort to bind the local political class to their interests, and thus advocates for far-reaching economic and social reform to uplift the Mezzogiorno from destitution. Presenting his ideas as a third way between conservative-liberal order and the dictatorship of revolutionary socialism, Gaetano Salvemini sees the reconstruction of whole Italy as only possible through universal suffrage, humanitarian socialism, implementation of a democratic republic based on the ideals of social justice, national self-determination for Italians in occupied territories and democratic interventionism abroad, meant to awaken Italy's consciousness and make the people rediscover and reconsider their democratic roots. While Salvemini sees a future in a reunified Italy, as his life goes on Concretismo has begun developing a noticeable and harsh anti-Northernern slant, even with calls to permanently separate Sicily from the Peninsula and calling the House of Savoy 'pigs in tuxedos'."

In recent years 'Jermanism' began to coalesce into a semi-concrete form of ideology, due to the influence of neighbouring leftist groups like the ones in India or China, and thus began advocating for separation of religion and state while still respecting the right to worship, council communalism in a semi-anarchist organization of the state, full removal of the hierarchical backwardness steeped in Kazi dominated class system, ecological and agrarian socialism, incorporating existing tribal structures into the functions of a modernized state and most importantly creating a cohesive syncretic culture uniting all of the diverse groups that call Sikkim their home into one 'Sikkimese' identity.

First and foremost, as a thoughtform rooted in Baha’i spiritualism, Baha'i Universalism maintains the teaching that successive Manifestations of God, presented to mankind through various religious prophets like Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha, have come to mankind in a pre-ordained order, slowly evolving mankind and our souls along the path to enlightenment, utopia, and epigenesis, which shall culminate in the eventual creation of a peaceful global world order that both unites all of humanity while abolishing any superficial dividers like race, sex, ethnicity, culture, and so forth, and protects the natural environment in order to bring an egalitarian and paradisiacal existence to all living things that is supported by traditional family values, feminism, education reform, and chastity while rejecting forms of spiritual elitism and societal laziness such as monasticism, medicantism, and asceticism, for self-exertion and service to humanity is paramount. Taking these spiritual teachings further however, Baha'i Universalism fuses these ideas with a soft and non-dogmatic nor ideologically-strict approach to broad Socialist and Progressivist reform, taking the best aspects from various different types of Leftist and Leftish thought in order to build a non-dictatorial communal society where each individual is free to decide how Socialist or not they want their own existence to be. Furthermore, since the Baha'i Faith does not endorse any specific economic system while being more focused on the spiritual and moral aspects of any solution to the economic problems society faces, Baha'i Universalism tends to follow and support the idea of economic self-determination, allowing the creation of a mixed economy with allowances for substantial local adaptations, variations, and flexibility among communes and communities. Despite this hyper-specific focus on the inner workings of local governance and the allowance of as much freedom within it as possible while still adhering to its own basic principles, Baha'i Universalism is equally focused on the Internationalist cause as well, envision a global commonwealth united in their peaceful ideas divided into autonomous subdivisions free to decide how to run aspects of their society such as their currency, or lack thereof, or their base regulations and approach to welfare systems. Primarily championed by the Anarchist, Georgist, and Esperantist activist James Ferdinand Morton Jr., whose own varied background in these wide-ranging fields has influenced the thoughtform substantially as it takes on facets of its practitioners like him, Baha'i Universalism is dedicated to global peace and love above all other pursuits, and through the earthly servants of Bahá'u'lláh, the spiritually enlightened and egalitarian utopia he envisioned shall be brought in this world for all mankind."

Hinging around the practice of Satyāgraha - meaning ‘holding firmly to the truth’ or the Truth Force, which is the particular form of nonviolent or civil resistance employed by the Indian independence movement and other similar forces, Gandhists and the Satyagrahi utilize peaceful means to resist the governments, regimes, and policies they deem tyrannical in order to indirectly achieve progressive reform and societal change without needless bloodshed, only lashing out in self-defense when absolutely necessary as a life-saving last resort - though this self-defense clause is highly controversial with many followers of Mohandas K. Gandhi rejecting it in favor of total non-violence or Ahimsa. Additionally, Gandhism teaches egalitarian religious unity, especially between Hindus and Muslims who long have ravaged the region with their violent rivalries (though the Mahātmā created these unifying ideas through a Hindu lens with Brahmacharya in mind while his friend Abdul Ghaffar Khan did so through a Muslim lens with the Pashtunwali in mind), while also fostering nonviolent passions of patriotism and varied breeds of nationalism, upholding inalienable human rights and freedoms, and advocating for asceticism, fasting, and vegetarianism or veganism. Economically, Gandhism espouses the need for simple living, self-sufficiency, and import substitution on an agrarian platform that would focus on meeting the material needs of its citizenry before focusing on wealth generation or industrialization, while also pulling from the utopian anarchism and pacifist progressivism of Socialist thinkers like Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. Though shunned as a term by its ‘creators’ and not a true ideology in the eyes of the Mahātmā or Sarhadi Gandhi, Gandhism is nonetheless a strong political, cultural, and spiritual influencer across Southern Asia and beyond as Gandhians across the globe stand up for peaceful progress without resorting to violence outside self-defense."

Popularized as a natural response to Russia’s increasingly imperialist policies, the Altaians sought to distinguish themselves from the surrounding tribes and to cement their own distinct ethnic identity in the face of possible cultural annihilation by embracing the new faith en masse. Originally millenarian, charismatic, and anti-shamanic all in an attempt to completely revolutionize Altaic culture and society so that it may survive the sweeping tide of modernity, Burkhanism has adapted to drop much of these aspects, becoming more routine and more rooted in Altai’s pre-existing folk religion and shamanistic bases, while also coalescing around an institutionalized hierarchy of oral epic singers that serves as the clergy and theocratic administrative and judicial body of the faith. Overall, Burkhanist religious ideas are a syncretistic mix of varied pre-shamanist, shamanist, Tibetan Buddhist, Tengrist, and Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs, though it is not viewed as being a sub-sect of any of these larger faiths, instead being its own distinct thing largely focused on Altaic national salvation, though some forms of the faith advocate broader ideas such as unity with the Tuvans or even all of Pan-Mongolia. Controversially, Ak Jang has also been hijacked and further developed by the Kalmyk-born Mongolian warlord Dambiijanstan, aka Ja Lama, who sees himself as the prophesied reincarnation of the messianic hero Amursana while preaching a far more violent and ethno-supremacist bastardization of Ak-Jang driven by savage banditry and geared towards the total destruction of the Chinese as revenge for their past crimes against the Oirat-Altaic people of old Dzungaria and beyond, but aside from this radical off-shoot not recognized by the main high choir, the White Faith is largely centered in Altai proper while promoting far more agreeable and peaceful ideas aimed at ensuring that Altaic culture and their very way of life endures."

Although starting out as highly Anti-Revisionist Marxists on the party's far-left wing, the three politicians became symbols of an heterodox strain of Internationalist Social Democracy sometimes called 'Germanic Socialism.' Such an outlook was shaped primarily by the War Socialism instituted during the Great War, transforming the bourgeois state into a centrally directed unit upheld by the cohesive support of worker-soldiers and trade unions. Another foundational text of the movement was Johann Plenge's book '1789 und 1914: Die symbolischen Jahre in der Geschichte des politischen Geistes', in which the 'Ideas of 1789' and thus Liberty were contrasted and had to be sundered by the 'Ideas of 1914' (Organization), represented by a newly reborn German spirit struggling to expunge the Anglo-French capitalist order. The deep influence of Plenge upon the Lenschian Tendency can be seen in its namesake's vision of the World War as an Internationalist Revolution, where the strong German Proletariat struck against the status quo affirming degenerated British labour movement founded upon the legacy of monopolistic parliamentarian monarchism and Calvinism. Only through the creation of a true 'Volksgemeinschaft', a people's community, can the German Empire which already made great strides in its recent democratization ensure that the the globe shall know the light of Socialism. To this extent Paul Lensch promotes the foreign policy ideals formulated by his two collaborators, Konrad Haenisch and Heinrich Cunow. According to them, self-determination is a right reserved to the nations infused by higher forms of democratic culture, and not any 'civilization', due to which German Imperialism is in a unique position to sweep away the primitivism of the autocratic societies and ensure genuine social revolutions founded upon modernization and industrial growth."

For the Federalists, the different ethnic groups and cultures making up China can only prosper by governing themselves, through regional assemblies made up of civilians elected by universal suffrage. The Federalists reject the concept of political tutelage of Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang, as they believe the people are already able to identify what is beneficial or not for them, and to form their own opinions. Federalist intellectuals also call for far-reaching agrarian reforms, including farmer subsidies and the promotion of peasant unions, while the position to adopt towards large landowners is still a matter of debate. Federalists' social positions are generally progressive, calling for a thorough overhaul of China's archaic legal codes and the development of a bureaucracy and a new class of administrators to replace the corrupt warlords. Their masters of thought are many, but the main one today is the general and revolutionary Chen Jiongming, who draws his inspiration mainly from the United States, wishing to organize 'the United States of China in the manner of the American experience'. Although criticized by some, such as Sun Yat-sen himself, who believed that federalist ideology would prevent China from defending itself against external threats and would legitimize the power of vicious regional governors, Federalism is making a comeback as the centralist Qing Empire is slowly losing its grip on China.

Given the immense variety of Spanish conditions within the boundaries of its international borders, with some areas like the Basque Country or Catalonia having a very distinct cultures and languages, the idea of federalism has been raised multiple times to create a nation that could unite these disparate groups while still supporting or tolerating their unique nature. During the process, a concept of a Spanish federation was created, outlining that the Spanish nation would be a hybrid, between pure federalism and centralist Jacobinism. During the first and second Republics of Spain, it was recognized that Spain as a nation was made up of various smaller states, with autonomy given to their regional actors and municipalities.\n\nThe Second Republic of Spain saw this idea transformed into the term Integral State, which would see autonomy granted to those regions that had an overwhelming desire for it, for example Galicia, Catalonia and Basque country. The Integral federalist approach has been utilized by various regional parties of Spain as well, with especially more conservative parties like Dereita Galeguista and Liga Catalana aiming for strong state level autonomy within an otherwise unitary state of Spain, imbuing local nationalism with a greater, more macro-level ideal of Hispanic unity, usually with some degree of Iberism mixed in, in rare cases involving Portugal in the greater Iberian Integral Federation. While the political programs of Integral Federalists may vary widely, and even the degree of federalism that different parties aim for may be completely different, the core value is the belief that Spain, as a nation, is inherently an unified concept, and that regional actors are better off under the wider umbrella of a Spanish nation than as a separatist, independent nations."

Contrary to what some may think, the Nordics do not constrain free enterprise, they cherish - breaking down multiple barriers to trade and creation of industry - for without it the progressive taxation system ensuring the continued welfare, universal healthcare and free education for all would not have the right to exist. Class struggle and notions of collectivization have been all but abandoned by the Nordic social democrats, with a small exception of the Norwegians still maintaining a commitment to some nationalization and state-run companies, instead being replaced by the idea best described by the Swedes as the Folkhemmet - People's Home where every citizen is a member of a grander family that contributes and cares for their fellow man. Although quite limited initially, the Nordic Model has become widely influential among all the political forces in the North, not just the 'revisionists' as some would scoff, and it may yet conquer the world as the premier social democratic mode of thought."

Inspired by Medieval English craft organizations, ideas of Social Democratic Federation’s poet William Morris, Fabian Society and the co-operative movement, the progenitors of the ideology such as Arthur Penty or S. G. Hobson and other associates within 'The New Age' magazine created a distinct branch of labour politics. Despite the initial aversion to factory production and hopes of a return to artisanal production organised through guilds, with further development by the stalwart that was George Douglas Howard Cole’s National Guilds League, this subset of Libertarian Socialist thinking clarified and came to a unified position. Society must be transformed into a system of participatory democracy based on basic units of workplace and community, the guilds, where tyranny would be averted through the state’s delegation of authority. While the final nature of future society is still hotly debated, ranging from a reformist nation that guarantees consumers’ rights and civil liberty to a federalized system of local structures, the supremacy of ownership by national guilds is always upheld. Even as its popularity waxed and waned, Guild Socialist remained influential among ambitious thinkers across the globe thanks to figures like: Olaf Stapledon - a science fiction writer envisioning an individualistic form of the ideology for the future of a unified mankind, America’s educator John Dewey, and Ernst Wigforss; leading theorist of the revisionist camp inside the Swedish Social Democracy."

Although initially supportive of León Cortés Castro’s bid for power and loyal to the conservative oligarchs controlling the nation, Calderón would grow disillusioned with the confines put up by PRN’s old guard, instead envisioning a total transformation of his homeland akin to what Otto von Bismarck’s state socialism accomplished. Thus, Calderonismo breaks with the influence of the established elites and instead extends its hands to the forgotten of Costa Rica, the growing middle class and the destitute working class. Based on a point of view which the ambitious reformer claims to be 'entirely Christian' the face of the nation shall be transformed into a paternalistic entity: providing universal healthcare, guaranteeing social security, giving uncultivated land to the willing, regulating labor codes to enforce safe working conditions, collective bargaining, rights to unionize, and building new housing zones. These achievements will be safeguarded by the new generations educated in rejuvenated universities - combining the best of science and theology supported by figures like the reformist priest Víctor Sanabria. There are voices which criticize Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia for merely wanting to replace one oligarchy with a clientelist system of his own, corrupting every corner of society and rigging elections as he sees fit, but that’s the price the people must be willing to pay for true progress.

This wide range can be seen by looking at only a few rural movements, such as the German national revolutionary Landvolkbewegung or the conservative and monarchist Bund der Landwirte, the more centrist Czech RSZML or the Finnish Maalaisliitto, and even the radicals in terms of social changes such as Poland's PSL Wyzwolenia or Bulgaria's BZNS."

Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K.

Following the assassination attempt in 1936 which left the President comatose for weeks the priorities of the party changed, as Kerensky took full control and steered the SRs into a position firmly on the Right of the political spectrum.

With Sharia law and Quranic literalism being common facets of Islamism, the religion has received ire from the Western Christian world, but the petty gripes of decadent hedonists and sinners cannot weaken the resolve of these brave and devoted zealots of Mohammad and Allah."

Named after Andrew Jackson, this mutation of Jeffersonianism has been espoused by many great American leaders such as Van Buren and Polk. Calling for expanded property ownership, the primacy of family farming, political decentralization, and conservative egalitarianism, Jeffersonian Agrarianism is a syncretic movement that combines Right-wing values and morals with Left-wing attitudes towards aiding the working class without falling prey to venomous Socialism or Liberalism. Staunchly anti-Elitist, this American variant also largely supports the ideals of former President Andrew Jackson, as well as Jeffersonianism, Utilitarianism, Classical Liberalism, Liberal Conservatism, Populism, Laissez-Faire economics, and the American ideal of Manifest Destiny amid claims that it is also racially motivated and wildly Nationalist while accelerating Jeffersonian notions of a strong executive to Jacksonian ideas of a near-supreme one."

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity. Despite their anti-Islamic slant, Pharaonists do not seek to ban Islam or other religions outright, instead pursuing Secularism as they work to build a society based on the former glories of Kemet and her proud people. Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

Common in new nations like Togo, Congo, and Nigeria that have long been racked by regional rivalries divided along ethnic and cultural lines forced to now live in an amalgamated nation, African Regionalism focuses on the development of a political or social system based on one or more ‘regions’ within a state, and/or on the national, normative, or economic interests of said specific region or other subnational entity. Similar to ideas of Nationalism but antithetical to their idea of total cohesion and equality across all territory, African Regionalism commonly fixates or prioritizes certain regions, ethnicities, cultural groups, religious sects, or peoples on a specific and personal basis unique to each nation and their reality, and is frequently seen in states and other recently-coalesced nations with a long history of factionalism, territorial rivalries, and ethno-cultural conflict, such as in Africa hence the name, but is also common in other regions such as across East Asia and the New World. Commonly favoring confederations and federalism over the idea of unitary systems and strong centralized governments, Regionalists look to places like the early United States, the Ottoman Empire, or modernized clannist structures as influences as they create a web of autonomous and semi-autonomous administrations within their national patchwork to create a modern nation state that fits the needs, traditions, histories, and unique differences of each constituent entity within the regionalist framework and their favored administrative entities or populations."

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society. This exclusivity solidifies the dominant position of the Cossacks within the political structure and ensures their continued influence.

Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered.

However, Mazzini himself and his ideology still support the Christian faith and wider spirituality, just believing it has no place within the functions of state, while also actively fighting against ideas of both Church elitism and radical atheism, as well as against the rampant selfish individualism commonly seen in other liberal republics that the ideology partially takes inspiration from, like the United States. For Mazzinists, a true republic is a place where freedom and justice can be achieved for all people - even non-Italians living in Italy and abroad based on Mazzini’s principle of a brotherhood or association of all mankind, and this ideal is pursued by walking a middle line of liberal compromise while maintaining a firm stance against both syndicalist and reactionary extremism. Violently opposed to the Totalists of Mussolini’s BNR as well as the Legionarists of Corradini’s ANI, seeing these movements as perversions of D’Annunzio’s true message of class collaborationist communalism and direct democracy in line with the Carta del Carnaro of D’Annunzio and Alceste de Ambris, Mazzinianesimo and its adherents, like Randolfo Picciardi and his faction within the Partito Repubblicano Italiano or Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi II and his brothers Sante and Ricciotti Jr. and the rest of the liberal veteran officers within the Associazione Nazionale Combattenti, are united in bringing true liberty, freedom, and justice for all Italians, and they are willing to fight and even die for their righteous republican cause."

This synthesis uplifts currents of classical and radical liberalism along with their idea that Liberalism innately is the sole political theory that truly takes the inner freedom of the human spirit into account as a given while adopting liberty as the goal, means, and rule of shared human life, thus putting the rights and needs of every individual citizen above all else instead of relying on some detached, state-driven goal or a ‘for the greater good’ mentality common in more traditional Marxist circles. Instead of compromising this idea of perfected liberty with socialist concepts, Liberal Socialism dictates that Socialism is not the end all be all, but more so is seen as the tool or method necessary to realize this recognition of liberty through political and economic autonomy and society-wide emancipation from the grip of pressing material necessity. Refusing to abolish capitalism with a socialist economy, instead supporting a mixed economy and broad economic syncretism that includes both social ownership and private property in capital goods, Liberal Socialism walks a middle path between revolution and reform, liberalism and socialism, in order to create a true society of liberty for all."

Popularized as a natural response to Russia’s increasingly imperialist policies, the Altaians sought to distinguish themselves from the surrounding tribes and to cement their own distinct ethnic identity in the face of possible cultural annihilation by embracing the new faith en masse. Originally millenarian, charismatic, and anti-shamanic all in an attempt to completely revolutionize Altaic culture and society so that it may survive the sweeping tide of modernity, Burkhanism has adapted to drop much of these aspects, becoming more routine and more rooted in Altai’s pre-existing folk religion and shamanistic bases, while also coalescing around an institutionalized hierarchy of oral epic singers that serves as the clergy and theocratic administrative and judicial body of the faith. Overall, Burkhanist religious ideas are a syncretistic mix of varied pre-shamanist, shamanist, Tibetan Buddhist, Tengrist, and Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs, though it is not viewed as being a sub-sect of any of these larger faiths, instead being its own distinct thing largely focused on Altaic national salvation, though some forms of the faith advocate broader ideas such as unity with the Tuvans or even all of Pan-Mongolia.

Despite views which many would describe as highly individualistic, anti-democratic and grasping at the 'aestheticism as freedom from politics' the experience of the War and later cooperating with Walther Rathenau changed Mann, pushing him towards seeing Germany as the shatterer of inert balance of power. A shift that resulted in the most recent variant of Cultural Mannism advocating for preservation of the slow 'parliamentarization' of the Kaiserreich and increasing its role as a guarantor of peaceful coexistence with moderate nations united in a specific kind of Pan-European cooperation."

Many left-wing Christians believe capitalism to be idolatrous and rooted in the sin of greed, often identifying the wider cause of social inequality to be this sin, and as such Capitalism and other similar systems that rely on unequal power structures are seen as antithetical to what it means to be a true Christian. Usually secular in that Christianity is meant to be used as inspiration and a vehicle for doing social good without forcing the faith upon people in exchange for aid and without proselytizing of any kind, Christian Socialists instead point to the Christian past and gospel for inspiration on how to live in the present and future, citing things like the New Testament, the Church Father’s Age of Basil of Caesarea, and even the Old Testament as early examples of functioning socialist systems operating in harmony under Christ. In the modern age, Christian Socialism initially began to flourish in the 19th century across Europe and North America, particularly among Catholics, Methodists, and Calvinists, but also among other sects, including certain Orthodox circles under figures like Father Gapon and Sergei Bulgakov. In the British Isles, its rise, or resurgence if counting groups like the Diggers and Levellers, was championed by Labor Party co-founder Keir Hardie, the famed thinker and art critic John Ruskin, the Fabian Society, and James Connolly who established Christian Socialism as a dominant force among Ireland’s Left. In France it was popularized by people like Philippe Buchez, in Italy with groups like the original Fasci Siciliani, and in North America by forces like Canada’s social gospel movement or Americans like the Quakers and the Bellamyists in New England, suffragists like Marion Howard Dunham, moderate anarchists like Adin Ballou, and the vibrant Christian Socialist movement centered in Utah around Myron W. Reed and Franklin Spencer Spalding, but Christian Socialism has since spread to be found in Leftist circles the world over. Tied to but distinct from more radical forms of Christian leftism, like the Christian Anarchism of Tolstoy or the Christian Communism that Marx and Engels wrote of, and from more moderate forms like Christian social democracy rooted in ideas we also take from like Catholic Social Teachings, Liberation theology, Personalism from figures like Valentin Sventsitsky, and other humanitarian Christian schools of thought, Christian Socialists walk a middle path between theology and ideology, adapting ideas from all corners of the Christian Left while seeking to unite two worlds commonly at odds with one another by attempting to prove they were never really that different to begin with."

Still poised at forging a united and cohesive ‘Belgian’ identity from the disparate French and Dutch halves that are the Walloons and Flemish, Reformed Belgicism seeks to divorce Degrelle’s failed ideas of violence and anti-democratic authoritarianism from ideas of Belgian Nationalism while providing for all Belgian citizens in one way or another. Not innately tied to a specific ideological current, Reformist Belgicism is primarily concerned with reducing the political autonomy of the constituent halves of its union while promoting national syncretism and bilingualism, though oftentimes each individual movement will heavily favor either French or Dutch for ease or out of personal bias. Reformist Beglcisits are frequently paired with ideas of Roman Catholic piety, Social Catholicism or non-Revolutionary Socialist Welfare, Belgian Unitarianism, and the cultivation of a uniquely Belgian culture and identity, but the idea of a Belgian nationality is not inherently tied to any one political group, with ideas of Belgian statehood and cultural cohesion stretching far across the ideological and political spectrums of the Low Countries, from the Reformed and Humanitarian Rexists of Hergé to the Humanist Capitalists of Buisseret and the Socialist Belgicists of Dehousse."

Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century.

Emerging from a literary club in Adelaide, South Australia, its ideals began in an address entitled "On Environmental Values" by its founder, Rex Ingamells. Breaking from the radical Australasia First Movement, the Jindyworobak Movement seeks to cultivate a distinct Australian identity and free Australia from "whatever alien influences trammel it" while allowing the revolutionary state's political machinations to continue unimpeded. The term "Jindyworobak," derived from an Indigenous Australian word meaning "to annex" or "join," reflects the movement's aim to blend Indigenous Australian elements with settler culture, fostering a unique national consciousness. Rooted in a deep connection to the Australian landscape, reacting to the urbanization of modern times, and an appreciation for a "sense of place," Jindyworobak supporters' only vague economic foundation stands in the aesthetic of the authentic Australian bush and preserving its majesty and agrarian way of life. However, the movement is not without its internal divisions. While some members advocate for a respectful and profound integration of Indigenous culture and activism, others view it more superficially, focusing on aesthetic elements and holding paternalistic attitudes rather than genuine cultural synthesis. The Jindyworobak Movement, therefore, encompasses a broad spectrum of beliefs and forms the most moderate movement after the revolution, allowing a fusion of liberal economics and unionist collaboration while focusing on cultural redefinition. Despite these differences, all Jindyworobak members are united by a common goal: to define and embrace what it means to be truly Australian in a cultural landscape still heavily influenced by its colonial past."

The movement is championed by Fred Maynard and the Australian Aboriginal Progressive Association, emerging as an offshoot of Garveyism introduced to Australia by African, Caribbean, and Indian seamen. The Sydney-based Garveyite organization, the Coloured Progressive Association, was formed in 1903 by these men, who spread Garvey's ideas among Aboriginal waterfront workers, leading to the modification to address the specific struggles of Indigenous Australians. The AAPA stands as the nation's first united and politically organized Aboriginal activist group, with a primary goal of ensuring that Indigenous affairs are managed by a proud and united Indigenous people. They advocate for the replacement of despotic Aboriginal Protection Boards with a management board composed of educated Aboriginals, with a chairman who would represent their people to the government. Additionally, the AAPA fights for Aboriginal citizenship, representation in parliament, or at least an ambassadorship to advocate for their rights. Central to their mission is securing land for Aboriginal families, grounded in the belief that Aboriginal people, as the original owners, have an inherent right to the land. These ideas have evolved through the revolution, with the AAPA working closely to unite the Aboriginal struggle with that of workers. Fred Maynard's active participation in the syndicalist Waterside Workers Federation of Australia exemplifies this solidarity, merging principles of Garveyist self-sufficiency, self-defense, and self-respect with the class solidarity inspired by his waterfront struggle. In their mission, the proponents of Aboriginal Garveyism aim for the spiritual, political, industrial, and social upliftment of Aboriginal people, steadfastly striving to empower their communities to determine and shape their destinies."

For the Federalists, the different ethnic groups and cultures making up China can only prosper by governing themselves, through regional assemblies made up of civilians elected by universal suffrage. The Federalists reject the concept of political tutelage of Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang, as they believe the people are already able to identify what is beneficial or not for them, and to form their own opinions. Federalist intellectuals also call for far-reaching agrarian reforms, including farmer subsidies and the promotion of peasant unions, while the position to adopt towards large landowners is still a matter of debate. Federalists' social positions are generally progressive, calling for a thorough overhaul of China's archaic legal codes and the development of a bureaucracy and a new class of administrators to replace the corrupt warlords. Their masters of thought are many, but the main one today is the general and revolutionary Chen Jiongming, who draws his inspiration mainly from the United States, wishing to organize 'the United States of China in the manner of the American experience'. Although criticized by some, such as Sun Yat-sen himself, who believed that federalist ideology would prevent China from defending itself against external threats and would legitimize the power of vicious regional governors, Federalism is making a comeback as the centralist Qing Empire is slowly losing its grip on China. Perhaps after the Middle Country the full extent of Jiongming's vision will be pursued, that being the establishment of a federalized Asia as a stepping stone to the spread of these principles to all corners of the world in an effort to establish datong, a harmonious and peaceful co-existence free of military struggles."

Named for its empowerment of trained managers as the guides of society, the Technicratic Government seeks to liberate the toiling "manual" workers from their days of drudgery through an ambitious societal reconstruction. As Rathenau has found, the assembly line has destroyed the individual's love of life, yet a return to handicrafts and agrarian utopias would neglect the destiny-defining production that industrial power provides. The solution then is to simply erase the barriers between the "manual" worker and his brother, the "intellectual" worker. These class divisions are to be cast off, replaced instead with "cultures" that their members freely associate with and where hereditary membership plays no part, and all easily joined and left as the individual understands their role in society. However, there is also an obliged transfer of people between the new cultures via the "Interchange of Labour". In this the manual worker will find solace in mental stimulation and gain an empathy for intellectual pursuits, perhaps even helping him realize that his choice is to labor within manufacturing rather than resign himself to that fate. Alongside the laborers, the “brainworkers” of the nation will then realize the trials their countrymen deal with, and they will become truly involved with society rather than remaining shut away with their pursuits. All this in tandem with a drastic increase in general well-being by utilizing the profits made from the manager's unobstructed direction of the economy. In this managerial mechanism, the pipedream of socialist equality is finally done away with, as instead now every man and woman understands their place in society and is gleefully willing to apply themselves. The parasites who feed off of society and give nothing in return, the loafers, idlers and slackers, will have their own place: expunged from the New Society."

Blasquismo is, at its roots, a populist ideology with a Spanish republican lean, with its core tenets being those of relentless grassroots activism, protection of Valencian culture and occasionally, violence against political opponents. Blasquist activism was organized primarily in various casinos located in the city of Valencia and in the newspaper articles written by Blasco Ibáñez. This led to the movement’s demonstrations being more sporadic and improvised than those of their fellow liberal republicans, but also netted them a far larger working class support than was typical to Spanish centrist parties. Like the more mainline radicals of Spain, Blasquismo is fervently anti-clerical and also historically fought with the Catalans over their attempts to expand political actions into Valencia. Blasquist movement underwent a period of civil war as Blasco Ibáñez and his party rival Rodrigo Soriano clashed over leadership, leading to bloody clashes between their supporters. This exemplifies best the difference between Blasquismo and other Spanish centrist Republicans, the grassroots nature and closeness to Valencian people has in the past cause the movement to inspire great fanaticism and party tribalism in its supporters. As can be expected, Blasquismo is heavily tied to the ideology of Alejandro Lerroux’s Radicals, as the main Blasquist party, Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista, was a close ally of Partido Radical. However, this alliance has undergone several periods of falling out and reunification, where the entire Blasquist ideology has shifted more towards conservatism or back towards more traditional radicalism depending on their relationship with the larger party."

While Lerroux’s and his party’s, Partido Radical Republicano’s, political positions have shifted dramatically during the era of the Second Spanish Republic and the military regime that followed it, Lerrouxismo at its core remains largely the same. Made up of fiery anti-clerical rhetoric, staunch resistance to Catalan separatism and heavy-handed tactics against its many enemies, Lerroux and his followers are willing to use violence, bribery and criminal means to achieve their aims. During the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Lerrouxists were also involved in assassination attempts aimed at the king Alfonso XIII, sometimes even uncharacteristically in alliance with the anarchists of Catalonia. Contrary to the typical centrist party support base made up of middle class and intelligentsia, Lerrouxismo relies very heavily on workers, especially from Catalonian industrial areas, where Lerroux has utilized immigrant resentment towards native Catalans to drum up support for his radicals.\n\nThese supporters, which Lerroux tended to call “young barbarians”, were encouraged to use radical means in order to tear down the control of the church and conservative institutions present in Spain at the time. The populist means used by Lerrouxists are also enhanced in part by the control the party holds over worker entertainment centres, such as the street of Paralelo in Barcelona. This has in the past allowed Lerrouxists to remain close to the grassroots militants of the party, as well as organized crime involved in gambling. Lerroux’s demagoguery and ideological flexibility has allowed this ideology to thrive despite the various twists and turns the Spanish politics have taken, but it may not always lead to the best results given the scandalous reputation the party has forged for itself."

Although the Committee for the Independence of Sicily was founded by the centrist-liberal Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile, who shunned any explicit ideological tint for the independentist cause, it has been largely championed by the Sicilian Left with its various socialists, social democrats, syndicalists, and communists like the revolutionary Antonio Canepa and the social-democrat minister Giovanni Guarino. The movement is also experiencing increasing popularity among the Sicilian Right, as the local aristocracy around figures like Baron Lucio Tasca and Duke Guglielmo Paternò, together with their traditionalist allies among the Christian Democrats, conservative agrarians, and even the Cosa Nostra continue to grow closer to the small right-wing of the CIS, not to mention the even more chaotic and less ideological circles like the Robin Hood-esque brigantaggio group of Salvatore ‘Turiddu’ Giuliano.

Divided on what to do with with the Mafia and other sources of corrupt elitism deeply ingrained in our age-old traditions, but fully determined to see their republican dream realized, Sicilianists rise like the new Vespers of old to throw off the foreign shackles that have oppressed Sicilia for far too long, once and for all."

Liberal feminism evolved from the middle- and upper-class women’s struggle for suffrage and desire for autonomy starting roughly in the end of 18th century, pioneered by the likes of the largely forgotten British women’s rights pioneer Mary Wollstonecraft and the American feminist titan Judith Sargent Murray. The goal of suffrage was not merely a political one, but it was heavily linked to the economical and social dependence women had to their husbands and other male family members, and it was believed that through the ability to vote, women could gain equal rights to men in all fields of society. The movement was largely part of the larger social liberal ideals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and would later splinter into more socialist-leaning strains of feminism as well.\n\nLiberal feminists believe in slow but steady reform towards a more equal society, the recognition of women as equally autonomous individuals as men, with rights to freedom of speech, movement, association and ownership as available to women as they are to men. Generally far more pragmatic and individualist as their socialist and conservative counterparts, liberal feminists also generally support wider inclusion of women into the academic fields as well as general workforce, and seek to push down barriers of prejudice holding the fairer sex from entering fields traditionally dominated by men. Liberal feminism triumphed in the United Kingdom and United States at the beginning of the 20th century after women were granted the right to vote, and while the ideology has been on something of a downward trajectory with the rise of socialist feminism, it still enjoys great deal of support in nations with a large middle-class section of women bereft of equal rights to many of the rights their male counterparts hold, such as Spain, many of the South American nations and colonial nations around the globe."

Libertarians emphasize pluralism, cosmopolitanism, cooperation, civil and political rights, autonomy, free association, free trade, freedom of expression, freedom of choice, freedom of movement, individualism, and voluntary association. Frequently anti-Statist but not fully anarchist, most Libertarians are skeptical of centralized power and overbearing authority, while skepticism of warfare, militarism, nationalism, and other similar ideas is also common but not guaranteed among all of them, with the biggest divergence being between Left Libertarians advocating Progressivism or even Socialism while Right Libertarians usually advocate Capitalism, Conservatism, and Anti-Welfare ideas. Linked to similar ideas such as Anarcho-Capitalism, Tuckerism, and Minarchism on the Right and Anarchism on the Left, Libertarians come in all shapes and sizes, but are united in their dedication to the Enlightenment ideas of liberty and freedom for all mankind."

Supporters of agrarian parties range from large landowners or landed gentry to smallholders and poor farmers, from the lower high class through the most consistent support base among the middle class, and ending up on the lower classes. The origins of political agrarianism can be traced to the 'government of nature' developed by physiocrat and laissez-faire advocate François Quesnay, as well as the republic of rural virtue of Thomas Jefferson. While supporters of such parties hold the people of the land as a foundation of society and the most important part of the nation's organism, they differ wildly in their positions regarding economy, taxation, protectionism vs free trade, system of government, religion etc. Agrarian parties are generally conservative and traditionalist, although there is a sizeable contingent of radically liberal and downright socialistic groups, with some unconventional right-wingers mixed in-between. This wide range can be seen by looking at only a few rural movements, such as the German national revolutionary Landvolkbewegung or the conservative and monarchist Bund der Landwirte, the more centrist Czech RSZML or the Finnish Maalaisliitto, and even the radicals in terms of social changes such as Poland's PSL Wyzwolenia or Bulgaria's BZNS."

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity. Despite their anti-Islamic slant, Pharaonists do not seek to ban Islam or other religions outright, instead pursuing Secularism as they work to build a society based on the former glories of Kemet and her proud people. Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

First theorized by German socialist theorist Ferdinand Lassale with his idea of the Nachtwächterstaat - a system inspired by the watchman system of public-organized militias separate from the government that protected towns and cities starting in Europe’s medieval period - Minarchism treads the line between State and Statelessness, arguing that Anarcho-Capitalism and other forms of total Anarchism are impractical as they cannot enforce the non-aggression principle, while total State control strips liberty and freedom from all beneath its gaze. As such, Minarchists tread this tightrope carefully as they use the night-watchman system to provide the masses a form of court system, military, and police force not originating from the State, but from the free masses themselves, creating a society free from tyranny that maintains the NAP and protects the public from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, enforcing property laws, and other encroachments on their inalienable freedoms, liberties, and rights."

In terms of the economy, it often fluctuates between supporting a free-market or protectionism, with many internal schisms fought over that issue.

The modernization must pass by the rejection of Islam as a factor influencing society and political life, Kemalism supporting a secularism based on the European model, which earned many criticisms from the religious institutions and the Sultan's relatives. The centralization goes through the establishment of a Turkish nationalist sentiment and the suppression of separatist sentiment of minorities threatening the survival of the Empire.

Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered.

A considerable influence on various thinkers across the entire ideological line from Antonio Gramsci to Giovanni Gentile, Croce has been the head of the Italian Liberal Party after Giovanni Giolitti, the controversial former prime minister died. Liberalism of the Spirit agrees that the individual is the basis of society, but rejects the idea of social atomism, seeing the individual as something more than just a collection of self-interests. For Croce liberalism does not have to necessarily involve fixed legitimate powers, nor Capitalism, for if another system, even Socialism which contribution to the Italian independence struggle Croce highly admires, would still advance liberty it has a legitimate place in society. This has lead Benedetto to separate liberalism from laissez-faire attitude to economics which he dubbed as liberism. For Aesthetic Liberals, following the thinker's Aesthetic Expressivism idea art representing emotions, there is no Lockean natural right to liberty, for it is granted by the continued vigilance against oppressive barbarism, led not by the absurd egalitarian notion but by true liberal aristocrats, the few which can create the goodness of truth, civilization, and beauty. All of the things that the great mass of citizens will benefit but not fully comprehend.

Literally meaning 'Whoeverism', the term has been adopted by the movement in a sort of mockery against the supposedly 'politically aware' classes that decry this populist anti-establishment stance, best characterized by one of their slogans Abbasso tutti! or 'Down with everyone!'. Giannini sees the State as inherently untrustworthy, having grown tired of its intrusion into people's private lives, and thus advocates for a purely 'technical' government with a single one year term politician that'd work like a dutiful accountant, administrating the minimized state and leaving after his job was done. The day-to-day running of the nation would be left to local committees with clerks directly responsible before the voters. Vowing to fight against both collectivist socialists and the big business capitalists, Qualunquismo advocates outline a reform plan for the nation that would include limits on taxation, removal of the government from social life and enshrinement of individual's economic liberty. Because of these positions, the movement has been compared and sometimes even equated to multiple right libertarian tendencies and ideologies. Surprising many observers, Giannini's Common Man's Front contains certain monarchist tendencies, seemingly seeing a monarch that governs but not rules as acceptable if the choice had to be made between the crown or the disdained ethical imperialists of mass parties.

While describing himself as a nominally left-wing liberal, Weber's desires and writings have found fertile ground across the political aisle and, despite his nationalist leanings, influenced many thinkers such as Talcott Parsons, Carl Schmitt, György Lukács, and Raymond Aron. Regardless, Weberian Liberalism can be defined by radical individualism, liberal nationalism, a sympathy for republicanism and Protestantism, and general belief in capitalism. Weber's deep affinity for the individual, however, has led to his thought system taking on a deeply anti-bureaucratic stance, especially in regards to the specialized efficiency brought about by modern capitalism. In Weber's view, the end result of the prevalent economic system of the present era is the creation of a rationalized 'iron cage' that would destroy a person's ability to create their own choices, the antithesis of the innovative spirit that capitalism should be encouraging. To bite back against this pessimistic view of modernity without venturing into reactionary rhetoric or gutting the efficiency granted by bureaucracy, Weber's platform includes a 'leadership democracy'. This system would involve a wide-reaching electoral process, emphasizing grassroots populism, to find a charismatic demagoguge with an unflinching conviction and the responsibility to use their power well. Such a leader is hoped to wield the opposites of rationalization: creativity, fervor, and personal will. To combat the possible autocracy this could craft, Weber proposes an involved citizenry that participates as much as possible in politics. Through this combination of a powerful executive and an educated, powerful citizenry, Weber hopes that the 'polar night of icy darkness' will not come to pass. Ultimately, the Weberian Liberals' primary enemy is the dystopic vision of a world controlled by a cruelly mechanized bureaucracy that must eternally seek more productivity. Thus, their raison d'etre is the avoidance of this fate by enlightening the innovative spirit of the individual."

Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century. However, these old, dusty relics from times medieval and ancient are not the only examples, other more contemporary kritarchies have survived outside Europe, being seen in the traditional Xeer legal system of clannist Somalia and the Jirga assemblies of Afghan society, or in the eyes of some modern scholars, being apparent within the government of the United States of America thanks to the landmark SCOTUS case Marbury v. Madison in 1803, which in the eyes of many scholars knocked the Supreme Court of the United States off the rails of checks and balances and down the slippery slope towards judicial rule. Even seen as a form of proto Anti-Statism by some fringe Libertarian and Anarchist scholars, Kritarchies are wildly varied and hotly debated, for many academics debate and doubt the veracity of many of these examples as true kritarchies, but regardless, they can be united along with other forms of government like them in their general adherence to judicial law and legalist governance."

Describing himself as 'liberal', De Jouvenel distanced himself from classical liberal capitalism, promoting the virtues of economic dirigisme, inspired by Henri de Man and the writers André Malraux and Pierre Drieu la Rochelle. For him, liberalism is above all an individual and philosophical concept, rather than an economic one, making public and communal associations the principal means of expressing freedom, while being convinced of the ineffectiveness of traditional political parties and admiring the form of 'organic and natural freedom' represented by the anti-parliamentary leagues, which brought him closer to monarchist and nationalist circles, as well as a member of the Radical Party's so-called 'Young Turks' movement. Although Jouvenel himself is a pacifist, being a firm believer in Franco-German reconciliation and cooperation. De Jouvenel is also a fervent advocate of political ecology, making the uses of political actions to protect the environment one of his main battles.

Guizot made class struggle one of his main principles, recognizing that society functions on a hierarchical economic order of conflicting interests, just as Marx theorized. However, Guizot drew a different conclusion: the working class should not crush the bourgeoisie, but work with all their might to achieve a level of material possession similar to that of the bourgeoisie, becoming themselves members of that class, thus creating a cycle of work and physical and psychological effort leading to innovation and societal advancement on a national level, class struggle is therefore beneficial to all. For Guizot, the aim of the state is not to artificially elevate people's social status, or to put an end to class warfare, but to ensure that every man has the means to take his destiny into his own hands and rise socially, hence the meritocratic aspect. Guizot, inspired by the philosophers of the Enlightenment, starts from the premise that every individual is born with the same natural freedoms, abilities and rights as his or her fellow human beings. Guizot therefore emphasized the development of education as the main goal in giving everyone a chance and the tools they need to succeed in their own right.

blasquismo_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Blasquismo)§!\n\nNamed after the man who perhaps exemplified everything the movement aimed to be better than anyone could replicate again, Valentician writer Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, Blasquismo is inherently Valencian in its origin. Blasquismo is, at its roots, a populist ideology with a Spanish republican lean, with its core tenets being those of relentless grassroots activism, protection of Valencian culture and occasionally, violence against political opponents. Blasquist activism was organized primarily in various casinos located in the city of Valencia and in the newspaper articles written by Blasco Ibáñez. This led to the movement’s demonstrations being more sporadic and improvised than those of their fellow liberal republicans, but also netted them a far larger working class support than was typical to Spanish centrist parties. Like the more mainline radicals of Spain, Blasquismo is fervently anti-clerical and also historically fought with the Catalans over their attempts to expand political actions into Valencia. Blasquist movement underwent a period of civil war as Blasco Ibáñez and his party rival Rodrigo Soriano clashed over leadership, leading to bloody clashes between their supporters. This exemplifies best the difference between Blasquismo and other Spanish centrist Republicans, the grassroots nature and closeness to Valencian people has in the past cause the movement to inspire great fanaticism and party tribalism in its supporters. As can be expected, Blasquismo is heavily tied to the ideology of Alejandro Lerroux’s Radicals, as the main Blasquist party, Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista, was a close ally of Partido Radical. However, this alliance has undergone several periods of falling out and reunification, where the entire Blasquist ideology has shifted more towards conservatism or back towards more traditional radicalism depending on their relationship with the larger party."

While Lerroux’s and his party’s, Partido Radical Republicano’s, political positions have shifted dramatically during the era of the Second Spanish Republic and the military regime that followed it, Lerrouxismo at its core remains largely the same. Made up of fiery anti-clerical rhetoric, staunch resistance to Catalan separatism and heavy-handed tactics against its many enemies, Lerroux and his followers are willing to use violence, bribery and criminal means to achieve their aims. During the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Lerrouxists were also involved in assassination attempts aimed at the king Alfonso XIII, sometimes even uncharacteristically in alliance with the anarchists of Catalonia. Contrary to the typical centrist party support base made up of middle class and intelligentsia, Lerrouxismo relies very heavily on workers, especially from Catalonian industrial areas, where Lerroux has utilized immigrant resentment towards native Catalans to drum up support for his radicals.\n\nThese supporters, which Lerroux tended to call “young barbarians”, were encouraged to use radical means in order to tear down the control of the church and conservative institutions present in Spain at the time. The populist means used by Lerrouxists are also enhanced in part by the control the party holds over worker entertainment centres, such as the street of Paralelo in Barcelona. This has in the past allowed Lerrouxists to remain close to the grassroots militants of the party, as well as organized crime involved in gambling. Lerroux’s demagoguery and ideological flexibility has allowed this ideology to thrive despite the various twists and turns the Spanish politics have taken, but it may not always lead to the best results given the scandalous reputation the party has forged for itself."

Liberal feminism evolved from the middle- and upper-class women’s struggle for suffrage and desire for autonomy starting roughly in the end of 18th century, pioneered by the likes of the largely forgotten British women’s rights pioneer Mary Wollstonecraft and the American feminist titan Judith Sargent Murray. The goal of suffrage was not merely a political one, but it was heavily linked to the economical and social dependence women had to their husbands and other male family members, and it was believed that through the ability to vote, women could gain equal rights to men in all fields of society. The movement was largely part of the larger social liberal ideals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and would later splinter into more socialist-leaning strains of feminism as well.\n\nLiberal feminists believe in slow but steady reform towards a more equal society, the recognition of women as equally autonomous individuals as men, with rights to freedom of speech, movement, association and ownership as available to women as they are to men. Generally far more pragmatic and individualist as their socialist and conservative counterparts, liberal feminists also generally support wider inclusion of women into the academic fields as well as general workforce, and seek to push down barriers of prejudice holding the fairer sex from entering fields traditionally dominated by men. Liberal feminism triumphed in the United Kingdom and United States at the beginning of the 20th century after women were granted the right to vote, and while the ideology has been on something of a downward trajectory with the rise of socialist feminism, it still enjoys great deal of support in nations with a large middle-class section of women bereft of equal rights to many of the rights their male counterparts hold, such as Spain, many of the South American nations and colonial nations around the globe."

The successors to the Father of the Nation uphold the following tenets of Venizelism as sacred: irredentism embodied in the Megali Idea, strong republicanism which manifests in commitment to civic nationalism and rejection of traditional conservative trappings of the Hellenic realm, pro-Western outlook that holds democratic values as ones worth defending against the syndicalist revolutionaries, and economic flexibility which - based chiefly on laissez-faire attitude to the market and investment - may borrow elements from more social democratic thinkers.

To call the Kingfish's programme wide would be an understatement, for his ideological musings combine elements from all sides of the spectrum while tying them together with the aura of populism serving the common folk. Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary. Ultimately, the political creation of Huey Long is a personalist vehicle not unlike those in Southern America, being everything to his die-hard supporters, while willing to borrow and utilize any idea that will ensure continued dominance of the AFP, Huey Long and ensure that every man can be king."

Seeing metaphysics, or philosophies dealing with the fundamental nature of reality, as a catalyst for spiritual development, religious enlightenment, and even immortality, Neo-Confucianists use this philosophy as a guide for creating an ethical and rational ideology based on modernized traditionalism, familial values and Confucianist socio-economic ideas such as gaining wealth over the generations in a ‘posterity through offspring’ system as opposed to the instant gratification of Western Liberal Capitalism, the pursuit of social harmony, humanism, and secular rationalism supported by non-intrusive spiritualisms and religions, among other more varied and less-widely agreed up ideas on politics and socio-economics such as cultural exceptionalism, civic or ethnic nationalism, class cooperation, and mercantilist, corporatist, communalist, humanist, or even neo-feudalist financial systems.

Common in new nations like Togo, Congo, and Nigeria that have long been racked by regional rivalries divided along ethnic and cultural lines forced to now live in an amalgamated nation, African Regionalism focuses on the development of a political or social system based on one or more ‘regions’ within a state, and/or on the national, normative, or economic interests of said specific region or other subnational entity. Similar to ideas of Nationalism but antithetical to their idea of total cohesion and equality across all territory, African Regionalism commonly fixates or prioritizes certain regions, ethnicities, cultural groups, religious sects, or peoples on a specific and personal basis unique to each nation and their reality, and is frequently seen in states and other recently-coalesced nations with a long history of factionalism, territorial rivalries, and ethno-cultural conflict, such as in Africa hence the name, but is also common in other regions such as across East Asia and the New World.

In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society.

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations.

Maurras' doctrine is based on the unity of society, a society that must function organically on the model of the Ancien Régime. The Action Française thus rejects the French Revolution and its consequences in order to establish a decentralized, traditional, localist and federal monarchy, with political powers concentrated in provincial assemblies with the King as the great national arbiter, while promoting Catholicism as the cement of national unity. On the intellectual level, Maurras emphasizes reason and Classicism and opposes Romanticism."

Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered. Regardless, the Pan-Scandinavian dream must be achieved, and through equal cooperation and shared destiny, the dream of a peaceful and prosperous Scandinavia bound by our shared Nordic Spirit will be earned as the Three Sisters gradually grow closer and closer together."

Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them. The most famous proponent of what came to be popularly known as 'esoteric nationalism' is Julius Evola, the Italian thinker who merged concepts of racial aristocratic elite, masculine heroism with pre-existing Western and Eastern spiritual traditions, chief among them Buddhism and Hinduism."

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper. Seeking to attain the near-godhood of the Masters while living their best lives in search of wisdom and enlightenment, Theosophists and their varied philosophy may have little in common across the different political and socioeconomic systems that push their truth, but all true Theosophists can still find light under the Absolute."

At its core, Qadimism places a strong emphasis on the preservation and revitalization of traditional Muslim communal institutions. These include mosques, madrasas, and local communities (mahalla), which are perceived as the bedrock of internal cohesion within the Muslim society. Central to Qadimist ideology is a deep commitment to the Sharia, the Islamic legal system. Qadimists viewed the Sharia as not only a legal framework but also as a means of safeguarding the specific interests of the Muslim community within the Russian Empire. This involved a resistance to the encroachment of secular influences on educational and judicial institutions, which Qadimists believe would compromise the collective identity and cohesion of the Muslim community.\n\nQadimism stands in ideological opposition to reformist movements, such as the Jadidism, which advocate for modernization and adaptation to changing circumstances. The conflict between Qadimists and reformists revolves around differing interpretations of the roles and goals of social and cultural institutions. Qadimists argue for the administration and redistribution of wealth by communal institutions like mosques, emphasizing the communal welfare over individual accumulation of wealth. The movement also critiques the emergence of a new intellectual class, often educated in European or Ottoman universities, that promotes secularization. Qadimists express skepticism toward these intellectuals, perceiving them as a threat to the traditional social order maintained by religious leaders (Mullahs) and existing community structures. In defending traditional Islamic education, Qadimists resist the introduction of reformed \"Jadid\" schools, championing the preservation of the established way of teaching in maktab and madrasa settings.

Sinarquismo is divided between two main factions, the revolutionary nationalists and national syndicalists of Urquiza, and the orthodox millenarians and assorted advocates of ‘Catholic Social Order’ headed by Abascal, while a small subfaction pushes in a more ‘moderate’ and semi-democratic direction by advocating either a union with the National Action Party or a transition of the National Synarchist Union into an official party of its own in order to garner wider public support, but both are moves detested by most true Synarchists due to their deep-seated hatred for democracy. Synarchists all agree that Leftism, Liberalism, and Atheism are the three worst things to haunt the modern world despite the other minor differences that divide them, and as such all factions seek to return to a more traditional and ultra-conservative platform under a supreme executive so that Mexico can be cleansed of sin, while also incorporating other varied ideas such as national conservatism, anti-populist class collaboration, Catholic theocratism, integral nationalism, Rightist communalism, and corporatist statism. Additionally, Synarchism maintains a symbiotic relationship with the Mexican Integralist movement as developed by Abascal alongside the great ‘cultural caudillo’ José Vasconcelos and Mexico’s surviving clergy and aristocracy, linking the two Far-Right political movements into one ‘Synarchointegralist’ coalition jointly aimed at saving Mexico with faith and fire while mixing ideas between the two groups - much to the chagrin of the Urquiza and his radical clique who now struggle in debate on the merits of republicanism with their new monarchist allies. Also holding tangential links to similar movements across the Catholic Right in places like Austria and Iberia through a shared adherence to the ‘Rerum novarum’ of Pope Leo XIII, Sinarquismo is the Mexican Right’s last chance to fully turn back the clock to a pious time before the Mexican Revolution."

During the process, a concept of a Spanish federation was created, outlining that the Spanish nation would be a hybrid, between pure federalism and centralist Jacobinism. During the first and second Republics of Spain, it was recognized that Spain as a nation was made up of various smaller states, with autonomy given to their regional actors and municipalities.\n\nThe Second Republic of Spain saw this idea transformed into the term Integral State, which would see autonomy granted to those regions that had an overwhelming desire for it, for example Galicia, Catalonia and Basque country. The Integral federalist approach has been utilized by various regional parties of Spain as well, with especially more conservative parties like Dereita Galeguista and Liga Catalana aiming for strong state level autonomy within an otherwise unitary state of Spain, imbuing local nationalism with a greater, more macro-level ideal of Hispanic unity, usually with some degree of Iberism mixed in, in rare cases involving Portugal in the greater Iberian Integral Federation. While the political programs of Integral Federalists may vary widely, and even the degree of federalism that different parties aim for may be completely different, the core value is the belief that Spain, as a nation, is inherently an unified concept, and that regional actors are better off under the wider umbrella of a Spanish nation than as a separatist, independent nations."

Maurism developed naturally as an alternative to the canovismo era, establishing itself as a regeneration of the conservative movement, willing to even engage in street brawls to further its causes. Maurism relies on corporatist, interventionists and nationalist principles, and despite attempts to woo workers, Maurism still draws most of its support from the middle class and right-wing intellectuals. Regenerationism of Spanish empire was also an important part of the ideology, and it occasionally took ideas from Charles Maurras’ Action Francaise.

Maurism evolved into a somewhat cohesive movement with the formation of Partido Maurista, but the lack of unity has historically led to factionalism and formation of splinter parties.

Luis Alberto de Herrera outlines a model for his nation which, according to him, is the continuation of the work of the Latin American Liberators inspired by concepts found in the early American democratic tradition of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, not of the Jacobin radicals as many erroneously claim. Contrary to what it may suggest to some, Herrerists are vehement opponents of imperialism and ‘banana politics’, instead their reverence for American legacy results in a push for a localist, decentralized, and self-sufficient federal system. In economic terms, Herrerismo puts heavy emphasis on ruralist supremacy and the continued existence of great latifundia, rejecting the notion that industrialization is needed or desirable, further cementing it through the promotion of manual education. In clear opposition to Batllist interventionism and etatism, Luis Alberto de Herrera has long championed a minimal state, in which free trade, low taxes and enterprise unburdened by government intervention shall create opportunities for everyone where needed across the entirety of Uruguay’s departments."
conservative_feminism_subtype:0 "Conservative Feminism"
conservative_feminism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Conservative Feminism)§!\n\nConservative feminism is a relatively small offshoot of the larger liberal and socialist feminist movements, seeking to pursue the cause of women’s equality within right-wing conservative parties or organizations as an alternative to its more radical counterparts. Conservative feminists are often aristocratic or middle-class figures with local influence and wealth, and their advocation for expanded women’s rights comes from the mindset that while both men and women are equal, they are substantially different. Usually associated with the earlier maternal feminism, conservative feminists seek to uphold traditional values and ideals, often mixed with a degree of nationalism, and view the traditional family structure as beneficial to the rights of women. However, this defence of traditional institutions is not absolute, and the conservative women’s movement was often started as a criticism of how little rights women had within larger institutions, be they secular or confessional.\n\nTheir political platform usually advocates for expanded education, healthcare and voting rights to women, though usually in a more modest and incremental pace than their more left-wing counterparts. Conservative feminism often stems from traditionalist women’s groups associated with religion or cultural circles, but there are also cases of more revolutionary conservative women’s movements aligning with national populist parties in Europe and Latin America. Examples of conservative feminism vary greatly in their appearance around the world, with the European Catholic Action-associated women’s groups, French Ligue de Femmes Françaises as well as the American Women’s Christian Temperace Union of Katharine Bushell and Frances Willard being particularly prominent ones."

Under the Chösid Nyi (both Dharma and temporal) a sacred incarnate, such as the Dalai Lama or Shabdrung, represents spiritual legitimacy while remaining independent of daily rule with a secular counterpart being responsible for taxes, law, defense, and diplomacy. In such an arrangement the chief abbot administers monasteries, education, and moral discipline, shaping society's spiritual center, all while his regent tends to the civic needs of the flock. Marked by constant ebb and flow of central authority, which is highly dependant on the court elite’s strength, regionalism has found a comfortable niche with penlops and dzongpons maintaining order through the use of local soldiers and forts. The dual system of government originated in the early 17th century when the Fifth Dalai Lama established a unified religious and civil government in Tibet; together with the implementation of the Chayik Chenmo legal code in Bhutan by the bearded Lama Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal. Over the ages the system evolved, with Tibet's Désid office disintegrating into the Kashag council and Bhutan establishing a hereditary monarchy in 1907 under Ugyän Wangchuk, combining secular and spiritual authority under the king which sidelined the Shabdrung. Only time will reveal whether this venerable tapestry of Dharma and state endures as a bastion of Buddhist governance - evolving into a constitutional theocracy in which spiritual principles guide secular authority - or vanishes violently from the halls of power."

Through the rejection of personal interests, the Castilhists transformed Brazil’s Southern state into a true republic of virtue - led by the ones most morally qualified and not merely elected. This was to be strengthened by a sweeping modernization founded on developmentalism seeking to 'conserve by improving', state intervention, political participation through plebiscites, and overarching vision of civic education.

Sidonismo as an ideology does not care if the 'maximum representative' of the people is a monarch or a president, for it will be the people that give the 'chefe' legitimacy through their right to universal and direct suffrage. Thus, the authority of the State will be paramount as it’s backed not only by the populace, but by a legitimized party - in Sidónio Pais’s case the National Republican Party, and the military which is the only institution with the monopoly on violence. Although the 'Sidonist Consulate' made great strides to restore traditional values, making amends with the Church, and bolstering the appreciation of the Portuguese homeland; it was tragically cut short before the non-party popular representation could emerge organically.

Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary.

With a monarchic Head of State who wields the power to appoint governmental officials, including the Head of Government themselves, and a restrictive three-class voting system that functionally favors the wealthy, Prussian Constitutionalism is designed towards enshrining an 'enlightened' form of monarchism and elitism as an unshakeable status quo. Despite these aforementioned characteristics, however, Prussian Constitutionalism remains compromising towards democratic ideas by forcing members of the legislature to be elected via a vote by the Empire's citizens, granting the populace governmental influence. Prussian Constitutionalism also involves an influential military as the Emperor alone remains the superior of the Imperial Army, leading to little checks on martial ambitions.\n\nWhile Prussian Constitutionalism started in Germany, the Kaiserreich's success in the Weltkrieg has led to many traditional monarchies to adopt some of the example set by the Kaiser in trying to maintain their power while still granting the people a bit more of a say in the dealings of the state. These states regularly change and rework various sections of the German constitution as they write their own to fit their needs, often becoming entirely new systems, and various states that merely exercise a semi-constitutional monarchy with a deeply strengthened monarchic executive will also often be described as Prussian Constitutionalist in nature, even if they have no relation to the German Empire at all."

Devoted to the greatest of the Founding Fathers, Washingtonians seek to create a society that truly lives by the American Dream as planned out by the Father of the Union, tied to ideas of Manifest Destiny, Civic Nationalism, Christian morality, American Patriotism, rampant Militarism, anti-radicalism, Jeffersonian Capitalism, and authoritarian Republican Democracy rigged for the good of all by a paternalistic military. Backed by a loyal armed forces, fanatical patriots, and a growing personality cult around the late Washington, these heralds of the Founding Fathers’ dream shall bring order and glory to the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave."

These ideologies, often without theoretical foundations, put forward a strong man, often a military man, around whom reigns a strong cult of personality showing him most often as guardian of the Fatherland and Father of the people. With a strong populist character, these regimes create legitimacy by often implementing non-socialist forms of welfare for the people, and by relying on nationalism or patriotism. The economic policies of these regimes vary greatly, ranging from state-run economies to free markets in favor of foreign companies to timid protectionism."

Denouncing liberalism, parliamentarianism, socialism and rejecting the modernism of the intellectual and political elites held responsible for the Communards' seizure of power, the Marshal's regime promoted instead a simpler, agrarian ideal of life centered around the family, religion and traditions while instilling in the youth the values of sacrifice and devotion to the Fatherland."

Despite the word Tory itself coming from a pejorative against Irish Catholics before being applied as a slur against supporters of King James II, Toryism later morphed into a colloquialism used to describe the major right-wing party in Great Britain. The ideological beginnings of British Conservatism are believed to be the Cavalier faction of the English Civil War, with later centuries bringing the influence of Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger. Policy-wise Toryism is characterized as highly socially-conservative, deeply Anglican, anti-liberal and very often pro-monarchist. In terms of the economy, it often fluctuates between supporting a free-market or protectionism, with many internal schisms fought over that issue. Because of the width of the label, some Tory politicians are hard to fit entirely into aforementioned criteria, which led to terms such as Red Tory or High Tory being spawned to describe such intricacies in policy."

authdem_agrarianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Agrarianism)§!\n\nDespite not being a concrete ideology with a central doctrine or fundamental tenets, agrarianism became a broad classification of various movements across the entire globe concerned with the interests and plight of peasantry as a whole. Supporters of agrarian parties range from large landowners or landed gentry to smallholders and poor farmers, from the lower high class through the most consistent support base among the middle class, and ending up on the lower classes. The origins of political agrarianism can be traced to the 'government of nature' developed by physiocrat and laissez-faire advocate François Quesnay, as well as the republic of rural virtue of Thomas Jefferson. While supporters of such parties hold the people of the land as a foundation of society and the most important part of the nation's organism, they differ wildly in their positions regarding economy, taxation, protectionism vs free trade, system of government, religion etc. Agrarian parties are generally conservative and traditionalist, although there is a sizeable contingent of radically liberal and downright socialistic groups, with some unconventional right-wingers mixed in-between. This wide range can be seen by looking at only a few rural movements, such as the German national revolutionary Landvolkbewegung or the conservative and monarchist Bund der Landwirte, the more centrist Czech RSZML or the Finnish Maalaisliitto, and even the radicals in terms of social changes such as Poland's PSL Wyzwolenia or Bulgaria's BZNS."

Typically anti-Western, anti-Liberal, anti-Socialist, and deeply Conservative and Traditionalist, Islamism is always deeply tied to the Islamic faith and church organization, but usually strays from becoming a full theocracy, instead digging roots into Republican, Militarist, Ethno-Nationalist/Theo-Nationalist, or rarely Democratic movements and systems, so long as they are heavily supported and dictated by the Muslim religion.

Named after Andrew Jackson, this mutation of Jeffersonianism has been espoused by many great American leaders such as Van Buren and Polk. Calling for expanded property ownership, the primacy of family farming, political decentralization, and conservative egalitarianism, Jeffersonian Agrarianism is a syncretic movement that combines Right-wing values and morals with Left-wing attitudes towards aiding the working class without falling prey to venomous Socialism or Liberalism. Staunchly anti-Elitist, this American variant also largely supports the ideals of former President Andrew Jackson, as well as Jeffersonianism, Utilitarianism, Classical Liberalism, Liberal Conservatism, Populism, Laissez-Faire economics, and the American ideal of Manifest Destiny amid claims that it is also racially motivated and wildly Nationalist while accelerating Jeffersonian notions of a strong executive to Jacksonian ideas of a near-supreme one."

Arguing that systems were made for men, and not the other way around, Social Credit seeks to bend financial rules and mainstays in order to ensure absolute economic security for its populace.

This strange ideology has evolved overtime, now reappearing in lands seemingly too civilized for this archaic way of life, and yet it still persists. In the case of places like Fiume, the Dual Cities were pushed to the brink, resorting to piracy in a bid to keep themselves afloat, both literally and financially. Due to its bellicose nature, Pirate Republicanism is usually incredibly strict and very loyalty-based, only promoting those of the highest merit with little regard to birth. Direct Democracy is used on board ships and within the army, but there are no elections to elect the Dual Governor or the city council in the case of Fiume, or the governments of other similar regimes. Pirate Republics are only usually willing to work with those they believe can be trusted or those that can help lessen the pirate plight. This strange ideology is uncompromising in the face of pursuing its unique goals and places heavy emphasis on cooperation and the wise management of funding, as well as within the idea of developing a "cult of personality" around the executive, being the Dual Governor, or Grand Admiral in Fiume’s case - the main progenitor of this weird ideology."

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of traditional Roerichism, the dedication to traditionalist values, the right to self-determination, and non-ideological pragmatism while using spiritual morality and guidance to guide humanity to virtue and prosperity.

It is deeply rooted in the Kuban People's Republic and the Almighty Don Host, and revolves around the concept of power being concentrated in the hands of the Cossacks. In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society. This exclusivity solidifies the dominant position of the Cossacks within the political structure and ensures their continued influence.

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper. Seeking to attain the near-godhood of the Masters while living their best lives in search of wisdom and enlightenment, Theosophists and their varied philosophy may have little in common across the different political and socioeconomic systems that push their truth, but all true Theosophists can still find light under the Absolute."

Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered.

Literally meaning 'Whoeverism', the term has been adopted by the movement in a sort of mockery against the supposedly 'politically aware' classes that decry this populist anti-establishment stance, best characterized by one of their slogans Abbasso tutti! or 'Down with everyone!'. Giannini sees the State as inherently untrustworthy, having grown tired of its intrusion into people's private lives, and thus advocates for a purely 'technical' government with a single one year term politician that'd work like a dutiful accountant, administrating the minimized state and leaving after his job was done. The day-to-day running of the nation would be left to local committees with clerks directly responsible before the voters. Vowing to fight against both collectivist socialists and the big business capitalists, Qualunquismo advocates outline a reform plan for the nation that would include limits on taxation, removal of the government from social life and enshrinement of individual's economic liberty. Because of these positions, the movement has been compared and sometimes even equated to multiple right libertarian tendencies and ideologies. Surprising many observers, Giannini's Common Man's Front contains certain monarchist tendencies, seemingly seeing a monarch that governs but not rules as acceptable if the choice had to be made between the crown or the disdained ethical imperialists of mass parties.

Firstly, concerning political matters, the transformation of the parliamentary republic, seen as weak and ineffective, into a strong, legalistic presidential regime where parliamentary unity behind the figure of the president would be self-evident is advocated for. Like the majority of the French right, de la Rocque is in favor of women's suffrage, but also family suffrage, consisting in granting an additional suffrage when a family is formed, i.e. a household with one or more children. An end to the anti-clerical policies of the Radicals and a return to Catholicism as a guide to life, through charity and social aid for example, although the Colonel's supporters are divided between those simply wishing cooperation with the Church and others a full-blown state Catholicism. The promotion of non-ethnic patriotism, the Colonel being notably opposed to anti-Semitism, which is rare in the French political landscape, although some members of his party still hold these views, de la Rocque is also in favor of cooperation between the differents European countries as, in his own words, 'a kind of federation of states belonging to the same civilization, dominated by major common interests'. On the economic front, corporatism and class collaboration are supported, although some criticize the fact that these would mainly favor the industrialists who finance the party, such as François Coty, and a non-radical extension of workers' rights, like the establishment of minimum wage for example.

Among Pelley's non-controversial ideas stands the right to a just trial, national referendums concerning both new laws and dismissal of lawmakers, annual dividends for native or naturalized American citizens and creation of the Universal Job Registry that would eliminate unemployment and make ensure no more hunger. More unusual of the Chief's thoughts present themselves in the creation of the Commonwealth Corporation, absorbing and subjugating many aspects of private businesses, similarly to the proposed Central Treasury Bank meant to distribute national credit, free universal education, implementation of all treaties with First Americans and the wide utilization of the Silver Legion structures. However, the most controversial aspects of Pelley's ideology concern his policies regarding certain minorities, such as Appalachian Whites, Deep Southern Blacks and Mexican immigrants, that have been deemed as 'unproductive'. They would become wards of the state and inducted into the 'ward system', deprived of any benefits the citizens have then relegated to labor jobs until they can be properly educated for entry into the Commonwealth. Beyond that Pelley has long held ideas many would deem to be 'strange', and thus mostly hidden by his allies in recent years. While the desire to establish Jewish segregation would fit with many a conservative and reactionary, the idea that European Rothschilds funded Knights of the Golden Circle to assassinate President Lincoln in retribution for Benjamin Franklin's supposed anti-semitic speech would be among one of the more peculiar ones. So too has Pelley expressed various esoteric believes in magazines like 'The Liberation' or 'The New Liberator', promoting ideas of Soulcraft, dark souls, extraterrestrial visitors and racial spiritual hierarchies. This ensured that the man who claims to levitate gathered various spiritualists among his more moderate and radical followers."

Despite being the son of the wealthy senator, William's electoral journey was at one point connected to the Progressive Movement. Such ideas led him to create the anti-Tammany Municipal Ownership League in NYC and then the Independence Party, calling for end to corrupt politicking, reforms and meritocracy with the help of a wide front of unionists, immigrants and established parties. While ideas like municipal ownership of public utilities and belief in meritocracy, although nowadays seen as support for the most successful wealthy individuals, stayed with Hearst he continued to slide towards conservatism. With the USA in crisis Hearst laid the groundwork for the creation of a new party, the National Democrats promising to combat social ills, substance abuse, crime, the red menace and most importantly the dread of the 'Yellow Peril'. Hearstian Democracy is a system in which the able entrepreneur is upheld as a role model, granted generous benefits of slashed taxation, trade unions are nationalized into a system dubbed 'American Corporatism', socialists, immigrant wastrels perpetuating drug abuse and any other crook are diligently caught by the politicized Federal Police. Beyond that Hearst calls for nationalization of alcohol, an idea influenced by the failure of the dry counties, the conquest of nature to build infrastructure and industry for the Californian Dream, and creation of the National Industrial Organization regulating wages and price gouging while promoting class collaboration. All of this tied with full control over the media, the state apparatus and international isolation, although any traitor and bandit beyond the border will not have the luxury of escaping Hearst's spirit, the same one that called for the war with Spain back in 1898."

Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them. The most famous proponent of what came to be popularly known as 'esoteric nationalism' is Julius Evola, the Italian thinker who merged concepts of racial aristocratic elite, masculine heroism with pre-existing Western and Eastern spiritual traditions, chief among them Buddhism and Hinduism."

At its core, Qadimism places a strong emphasis on the preservation and revitalization of traditional Muslim communal institutions. These include mosques, madrasas, and local communities (mahalla), which are perceived as the bedrock of internal cohesion within the Muslim society. Central to Qadimist ideology is a deep commitment to the Sharia, the Islamic legal system. Qadimists viewed the Sharia as not only a legal framework but also as a means of safeguarding the specific interests of the Muslim community within the Russian Empire. This involved a resistance to the encroachment of secular influences on educational and judicial institutions, which Qadimists believe would compromise the collective identity and cohesion of the Muslim community.\n\nQadimism stands in ideological opposition to reformist movements, such as the Jadidism, which advocate for modernization and adaptation to changing circumstances. The conflict between Qadimists and reformists revolves around differing interpretations of the roles and goals of social and cultural institutions. Qadimists argue for the administration and redistribution of wealth by communal institutions like mosques, emphasizing the communal welfare over individual accumulation of wealth. The movement also critiques the emergence of a new intellectual class, often educated in European or Ottoman universities, that promotes secularization. Qadimists express skepticism toward these intellectuals, perceiving them as a threat to the traditional social order maintained by religious leaders (Mullahs) and existing community structures. In defending traditional Islamic education, Qadimists resist the introduction of reformed \"Jadid\" schools, championing the preservation of the established way of teaching in maktab and madrasa settings. This resistance is driven by the belief that maintaining traditional educational methods is essential for the cohesion and well-being of the Muslim community."

Popularized as a natural response to Russia’s increasingly imperialist policies, the Altaians sought to distinguish themselves from the surrounding tribes and to cement their own distinct ethnic identity in the face of possible cultural annihilation by embracing the new faith en masse. Originally millenarian, charismatic, and anti-shamanic all in an attempt to completely revolutionize Altaic culture and society so that it may survive the sweeping tide of modernity, Burkhanism has adapted to drop much of these aspects, becoming more routine and more rooted in Altai’s pre-existing folk religion and shamanistic bases, while also coalescing around an institutionalized hierarchy of oral epic singers that serves as the clergy and theocratic administrative and judicial body of the faith. Overall, Burkhanist religious ideas are a syncretistic mix of varied pre-shamanist, shamanist, Tibetan Buddhist, Tengrist, and Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs, though it is not viewed as being a sub-sect of any of these larger faiths, instead being its own distinct thing largely focused on Altaic national salvation, though some forms of the faith advocate broader ideas such as unity with the Tuvans or even all of Pan-Mongolia. Controversially, Ak Jang has also been hijacked and further developed by the Kalmyk-born Mongolian warlord Dambiijanstan, aka Ja Lama, who sees himself as the prophesied reincarnation of the messianic hero Amursana while preaching a far more violent and ethno-supremacist bastardization of Ak-Jang driven by savage banditry and geared towards the total destruction of the Chinese as revenge for their past crimes against the Oirat-Altaic people of old Dzungaria and beyond, but aside from this radical off-shoot not recognized by the main high choir, the White Faith is largely centered in Altai proper while promoting far more agreeable and peaceful ideas aimed at ensuring that Altaic culture and their very way of life endures."

Through the combined strength of the armed forces and his National Party of Honduras, Tiburcio slowly transformed the nation's democracy into an authoritarian system dubbed 'El Cariato.' The main tenets of his ideology are a legalistic approach to continued dictatorial dominance, ensured by constitutional changes, abolition of citizenship for women, re-introduction of the death penalty and conservative economic policies. These are reflected in strict and timely debt repayment for foreign companies and cooperation in the area of building new infrastructure. Of course, such efforts are made possible by a strong stance against the liberals, communists and the labour movement as a whole, often targeted by military forces, censored and thrown into work camps. Andino has also found inspiration within many European rightist movements such as Legionarism, resulting in a drive to create a new model citizen of Honduras. Due to the vision being based on the Mestizo population perceived as heirs to the Mayan Empire, the government of Andino began campaigns of discrimination targeting the African-Amerindian Garifuna minority. Ultimately, 'El Cariato' became not only a very model of order and efficiency for fellow Central American autocrats, but also a keen sponsor and provider of safe haven for those exiled from their birthright such as Nicaragua's Somozoa and his Guardia Nacional."

Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century. However, these old, dusty relics from times medieval and ancient are not the only examples, other more contemporary kritarchies have survived outside Europe, being seen in the traditional Xeer legal system of clannist Somalia and the Jirga assemblies of Afghan society, or in the eyes of some modern scholars, being apparent within the government of the United States of America thanks to the landmark SCOTUS case Marbury v. Madison in 1803, which in the eyes of many scholars knocked the Supreme Court of the United States off the rails of checks and balances and down the slippery slope towards judicial rule. Even seen as a form of proto Anti-Statism by some fringe Libertarian and Anarchist scholars, Kritarchies are wildly varied and hotly debated, for many academics debate and doubt the veracity of many of these examples as true kritarchies, but regardless, they can be united along with other forms of government like them in their general adherence to judicial law and legalist governance."

Noucentisme, is at its core, a Catalan nationalist movement, deeply immersed in conservatism, and at times, wider Spanish regionalism instead of full-fledged separatism from Spain. Noucentists differ from the more traditionalist conservatives of Catalonia, such as the Carlists and Vigatanists, by embracing a limited degree of modern values in addition to their Catholic faith. Noucentists embraced city life as the new polis of the modern era, with Barcelona becoming a sort of new city state of old Greek and Roman eras, combating the reactionary barbarism of the countryside.\n\nSupported mainly by liberal and conservative bourgeoisie, Noucentists valued order, civility and classicism above all else, and in their views, the transformation of the real, tangible Catalonia of the present could be transformed into this ideal, harmonic and flawless Catalonia through a systematic reform of Catalan institutions through the Commonwealth of Catalonia to protect them from Spanish influences, the promotion and development of Catalan language through the Institut d'Estudis Catalans. Noucentisme was influenced heavily by the writer and philosopher Eugeni d'Ors, as well as politician Enric Prat de la Riba, and mainly due to its conservative origins, it gained traction among Liga Regionalista. While its influence has largely vaned among Catalan politics due to the repression of the Spanish military, after independence Noucentisme has begun to return in force thanks to the need to codify Catalan conservatism in the face of ongoing left-wing hegemony."

Conservative, nationalists and easily adaptable to both republican and monarchist systems of Spain, it began its relevancy in 1913 following a split in the Spanish Conservative Party. Maurism developed naturally as an alternative to the canovismo era, establishing itself as a regeneration of the conservative movement, willing to even engage in street brawls to further its causes. Maurism relies on corporatist, interventionists and nationalist principles, and despite attempts to woo workers, Maurism still draws most of its support from the middle class and right-wing intellectuals. Regenerationism of Spanish empire was also an important part of the ideology, and it occasionally took ideas from Charles Maurras’ Action Francaise. Maurism was never officially endorsed by Antonio Maura himself, and due to this rather loose association of Maurists, the movement developed into different strands, each associating with one another but differing rather significantly in political programs.\n\nGabriel Maura led a more liberal wing of the Maurists, Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo focused on the social Catholic wing of the movement while Antonio Goicoechea was perhaps the most radical Maurist, advocating for an “organic democracy”, anti-liberal and at times monarchist Spain. Maurism evolved into a somewhat cohesive movement with the formation of Partido Maurista, but the lack of unity has historically led to factionalism and formation of splinter parties.

Durkheim postulated a system dubbed 'Corporate Solidarism', which would eliminate anomies generating class conflict by reforming society according to the principles of organic solidarity. These would be ensured through the formation of single public institutions based on professions. Pesch, while holding similar believes, emphasized the crucial value of the 'Socialization of Persons' through labor unions, guilds and chambers of commerce. Heavinly influenced by heavily Catholic corporatists and himself influential on Christian Democrats, he envisioned a world of humanist international of patriotic states built on the pillar that is family.\n\nNowadays, the most influential group representing Solidarism would be the National Union of the New Generation, a party originating from a Russian youth movement growing up in the aftermath of the Civil War and Kerenskyist failures. Railing against the 'sins and prejudices of the past', thus limiting membership based on age, the NSNP hopes to transform their homeland into a tolerant civic nationalist state built on foundations of religious charity, societal cooperation, individual liberty and property, finalized agrarian reform and eternal vigil against socialistic radicalism. Although predominantly republican, there are some who hold monarchist sympathies, but both agree on the importance of democratic modes of participation.

Given the immense variety of Spanish conditions within the boundaries of its international borders, with some areas like the Basque Country or Catalonia having a very distinct cultures and languages, the idea of federalism has been raised multiple times to create a nation that could unite these disparate groups while still supporting or tolerating their unique nature. During the process, a concept of a Spanish federation was created, outlining that the Spanish nation would be a hybrid, between pure federalism and centralist Jacobinism. During the first and second Republics of Spain, it was recognized that Spain as a nation was made up of various smaller states, with autonomy given to their regional actors and municipalities.\n\nThe Second Republic of Spain saw this idea transformed into the term Integral State, which would see autonomy granted to those regions that had an overwhelming desire for it, for example Galicia, Catalonia and Basque country. The Integral federalist approach has been utilized by various regional parties of Spain as well, with especially more conservative parties like Dereita Galeguista and Liga Catalana aiming for strong state level autonomy within an otherwise unitary state of Spain, imbuing local nationalism with a greater, more macro-level ideal of Hispanic unity, usually with some degree of Iberism mixed in, in rare cases involving Portugal in the greater Iberian Integral Federation. While the political programs of Integral Federalists may vary widely, and even the degree of federalism that different parties aim for may be completely different, the core value is the belief that Spain, as a nation, is inherently an unified concept, and that regional actors are better off under the wider umbrella of a Spanish nation than as a separatist, independent nations."

Conservative feminists are often aristocratic or middle-class figures with local influence and wealth, and their advocation for expanded women’s rights comes from the mindset that while both men and women are equal, they are substantially different. Usually associated with the earlier maternal feminism, conservative feminists seek to uphold traditional values and ideals, often mixed with a degree of nationalism, and view the traditional family structure as beneficial to the rights of women. However, this defence of traditional institutions is not absolute, and the conservative women’s movement was often started as a criticism of how little rights women had within larger institutions, be they secular or confessional.\n\nTheir political platform usually advocates for expanded education, healthcare and voting rights to women, though usually in a more modest and incremental pace than their more left-wing counterparts. Conservative feminism often stems from traditionalist women’s groups associated with religion or cultural circles, but there are also cases of more revolutionary conservative women’s movements aligning with national populist parties in Europe and Latin America.

After a brief stint as Shrevport’s American Federation of Labor chaplain L.K. Smith would gravitate to the grandest political project he’d ever witness, Huey Long’s Share Our Wealth. Becoming Kingfish’s most devout follower, leading to critics calling his future position 'sycophantic Smithian Longism', Gerald Smith would form the so-called 'Three Musketeers' of America First alongside Father Charles Coughlin and Francis Townsend. The modern-day Savonarola would take the right-flank of Huey’s movement to its logical conclusion, forming the Christian Nationalist Crusade in an effort to fight for distributist reforms and against 'mongrelization' threantning to tear down the Cross and the Flag. According to Smith the recent strife, cultural erosion, red infiltration and Negro galavanting were all orchestrated by the eternal enemies of God, the Jews. Only through a return of American to Christian Nationalist roots shall the world government of the Elders of Zion be defeated, and the face of the nation purified. Although the Crusade has welcomed people supportive of Nordicist Christian Identity and British Israelism, L.K. Smith does not subscribe to these beliefs personally. For the 'Minister of Hate' as the traitors call him there is only one task worth fighting for, the salvation of White America from the hands of the Semites and their pseudo-progressive allies."

The resulting conclusion has led organizations like the Blueshirts supportive of Francisco Rolão Preto, Paraguay’s stalwart right-flank of the Colorados inside the Guión Rojo and many others to press boldly towards the realization of one grand vision. A totalitarian state must be built, taking the best of the 'Left' Syndicalists and purifying it through the supreme National - be it race, religion, culture, tradition - in order to ensure that the common people, the hard-working men of their states are free from internal and external exploitation."

Seeing the first Republic as a degenerated form of democracy influenced by Masonic infiltration and liberal individualism, Salazar initially welcomed the Sidonist coup and the royalist Restauração. However, the inability of both regimes to implement the Social Teaching of the Church would lead António to formulate an idea based on the authoritarianism of Sidonismo, coupled with the Rerum Novarum and Quadragesimo Anno encyclicals. Estado Novo, sometimes known as Salazarismo, proposes the creation of a 'New State' on the pillars of discipline, order, conservatism, and Catholicism. The leader shall, not being a messianic cult figure, merely institute a corporatist system backed by a supportive 'non-party', rejecting the 'exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, and the propensity for organising masses behind a single leader' characteristic of the national syndicalists of Rolão Preto or other pagan ceasarists. To Salazar the protection of the Portuguese family is paramount, be it the one at home or the wider entity from Lisbon to Macau. Although Pluricontinentalism is embraced, the Lusotropicalist ideology of Portugal as a uniquely humane colonizer shaped by climate and influence of various peoples like the Celts, Romans, Visigoths, Moors, Jews is downplayed, with the Estado Novo being wary of miscegenation, instead preferring the nationalist concept of multiracial Ultramar. New generations, educated by clergy, shall hold true to the words António Salazar directed to all faithful Salazarists: 'We are opposed to all forms of Internationalism, Communism, Socialism, Syndicalism and everything that may divide or minimize, or break up the family. We are against class warfare, irreligion and disloyalty to one’s country; against serfdom, a materialistic conception of life, and might over right'."

For as Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton died during this romantic pursuit of a land beyond human habitat, beyond civilization’s grasp, he joined the pantheon of men whose names would be inscribed in the annals of history. Like the questing knights of yore, figures such as Adrien de Gerlache, Carsten Borchgrevink, Robert Falcon Scott, Erich von Drygalski, Jean-Baptiste Charcot, William Speirs Bruce, Roald Amundsen, and many others accomplished feats unimaginable to generations before merely through the sheer force of will, an 'anachronistic' vision, and the 'primitive' technologies of their time. As the gained national honor was washed away in the Weltkrieg and the instability that followed came the Age of Machines, of technical comforts and lack of respect for mankind’s drive to shatter its barriers, just like the Industrial Revolution of old reshaped society as we knew it. 'Gadgets! Gadgets! Gadgets everywhere!', cried those not ready to accept that the future of Antarctic exploration would be bound to the tools we came to rely on, to the purposes we have hitched our future to - the conquest of resources and the development of martial prowess. Barely anyone ventures to the land of the Earth’s Southern Pole, with only Kapitän Alfred Ritscher - who personally remembers participating in the age of heroes - being tasked by the Kaiser to continue the process of prospecting and establishing new military-civilian bases. Thus, the Neuschwabenland expedition was assigned materiel no other power could spare - as meager as that amount ended up being. Even then, there are certain madmen convinced that great ice sheets at the bottom of the world hides secrets, mysteries beyond anyone’s understanding. People like them provide a much needed, although quite rare, respite from the crushing mundanity of working in Antarctica itself.

An interpretation of the policies and ideas of King Gustav III, Gustavianism places a major effort on policies favourable to the middle class, aims to curtail and contain the powers of more rogue elements in the upper classes, and views the working class as needing protection from foreign political winds. In the spirit of the Gustavian age, Gustavianism wishes to bring back an increased focus on national culture and character, puts a great effort on art and entertainment, and advocates for Swedish adventurism abroad. Indeed, while Gustavianism is focused on Sweden, romantic thoughts are given onto Finland as well, not just as a brother nation but as an integral part that's been stolen from Sweden by the arch-rival Russia more than a century ago. With the idea of an absolute Crown, be it embodied in a monarch or in the state itself, Gustavians emphasize the social role of the Crown in wider society, with hospitals schools and other important facilities being expected from the state. Regardless, just like Gustav III, his modern followers the Gustavians believe in expansion abroad, hoping that the Swedish state can carve their own peace of the global pie in the turbulent times ahead."

To call the Kingfish's programme wide would be an understatement, for his ideological musings combine elements from all sides of the spectrum while tying them together with the aura of populism serving the common folk. Despite demanding an ambitious plan, 'Share Our Wealth', redistributing the earnings of greedy corporations and masters of finance, this hasn't stopped Long from including the same wealthy oligarchs as willing participants in his reforms. Beyond that, the Senator outlines rural subsidies and a mix of Keynesian and cooperative economics. Highly popular ideas like improved education, old age and veteran pensions, restoration of the Founders and Scripture's legacy and modernization of infrastructure and healthcare are only among some of the proposed policies. No matter how lofty they might seem, the Governor knows that he could not implement them in the existing structures and thus has come to rely on his Minutemen for needed intimidation, further increasing the power and influence of the AFP's political machine, an organization that previously turned Louisiana into a borderline personal fiefdom for the ambitious politician. While Long's views on racial issues remain rather muddy, his policies have both helped Black people by ending the poll tax requirement for voting and redistributing wealth to needed communities, while also refusing to support anti-lynching legislation and often willing to cooperate with racist southerners if that'd lend him more votes. Due to the chameleonic nature of Longism and cooperation with everyone from the sycophantic christian nationalist Gerald L.K. Smith to the socialistic progressive visionary Alfred Bingham, the Kingfish has been called anything and everything from a godless communist to dangerous reactionary.

The degree of collaboration between these states varies greatly, with the more moderate Hispanic thinkers such as Ramón Menéndez Pidal, José María Samper and Miguel de Unamuno calling for a coalition of former Spanish imperial states to form a block of collaboration for the advancement of the Spanish language and cultures tied to it in a fraternal union. Conservative-leaning Hispanists often associate the movement with the supremacy of the Hispanic race, though whether this is part of the Latin American concept of La Raza, including intermixed Spanish-indigenous populations, or simply includes the most ‘purely’ Spanish members of Hispanic societies is often up to interpretation.

Not only was the South neglected, it was subject to brutal mass repression and killing campaign targeting civilians under the pretense of combating supposed 'brigandage', despite the so-called briganti being nothing more than true freedom fighters harkening back to the times of resistance against Napoleonic invaders. In terms of political backing resurgent Bourbonism found many allies across the Catholic laity and the clergy still bitter over the Roman Question and emboldened by the fall of the Savoyard kingdom. The most prominent writer-intellectual of Neoborbonismo, free to speak his mind after the autonomist dream was unshackled when the South was abandoned during the collapse of the North to the Socialist forces, is Carlo Alianello, heralded by many as the righteous revisionist of the falsified vision presented by the standard narratives of the Italian 'Unification'."

Due to this inherently broad descriptor, an oligarchy can take the form of a mercantile republic, a state dominated by corporate interests, or even a fiercely meritocratic regime that emphasizes the role of an intelligent elite as the forefront of administration. Furthermore, Oligarchism can be remarkably different in how it determines who shall wield the power, with some oligarchies having a racial basis for their hierarchy. Oligarchs themselves typically come from backgrounds of immense wealth, causing them to be derided as only caring about their own power over the well-being of the nation itself as they continue to safeguard their capital and remain corrupted with nepotism. Regardless of such claims, oligarchies, diverse as they are, can still take a shape of rather libertine governance, so long as the power of the privileged few remains assured."

Contemporary Yugoslavism is largely split between two dominant subtypes, being the integrationists who favored integral Yugoslavism while promoting unitarism, centralization, and the rapid total unification of the South Slavic ethnic and linguistic groups into a single Yugoslav nation, even by coercion if necessary, and the federalists which advocated for the autonomy of each slice of historic South Slavic lands in the form of a diverse federation that would slowly work towards total unification at a gradual pace, and without outside pressure. However, despite their differences, both subsects agree on the concept of National Oneness developed as an expression of the strategic alliance of South Slavs in Austria-Hungary, and as a reaction to the rise of Germanization, Trialism, and Magyarization running rampant throughout the empire hellbent on either snuffing out the South Slavs or subjugating use to Vienna for good, thus giving credence to the concept that the South Slavs belong to a single ‘race’, are of ‘one blood’, and hold a shared language. Divided on matters of economics or governance, with monarchist, republican, reactionary, and socialist variants all being on the rise, it is this oneness of race, tongue, culture, and history that should be focused on first instead, so that the idea of South Slavic unity can be uplifted, united, and supported to create a prosperous future for our related peoples."

The Colonel's party remains divided, but agrees on several principles, all united behind their slogan 'Social d'Abord'. Firstly, concerning political matters, the transformation of the parliamentary republic, seen as weak and ineffective, into a strong, legalistic presidential regime where parliamentary unity behind the figure of the president would be self-evident is advocated for. Like the majority of the French right, de la Rocque is in favor of women's suffrage, but also family suffrage, consisting in granting an additional suffrage when a family is formed, i.e. a household with one or more children. An end to the anti-clerical policies of the Radicals and a return to Catholicism as a guide to life, through charity and social aid for example, although the Colonel's supporters are divided between those simply wishing cooperation with the Church and others a full-blown state Catholicism. The promotion of non-ethnic patriotism, the Colonel being notably opposed to anti-Semitism, which is rare in the French political landscape, although some members of his party still hold these views, de la Rocque is also in favor of cooperation between the differents European countries as, in his own words, 'a kind of federation of states belonging to the same civilization, dominated by major common interests'. On the economic front, corporatism and class collaboration are supported, although some criticize the fact that these would mainly favor the industrialists who finance the party, such as François Coty, and a non-radical extension of workers' rights, like the establishment of minimum wage for example. Although presenting themselves as 'moderates', the use of paramilitaries and sometimes violence leads some to classify the CDF as just another Far-Right League."

Dzierzgowski posits that monarchy is the form of government most fit to the biological laws that govern the organic world, as can be seen by the self-preservation instinct which clearly crystalizes in the unbroken line of family establishing dynasty then a tribe, a nation and ultimately a state. Such an instinct can also be observed in a parents' love for their offspring, paralleled by the sovereigns attitude to his subjects, a thing which cannot be observed in any democracy for it does not even exist in the natural world. To Scientific Monarchists such a system is not a rule of the people, but their mass psychosis that needs to be eliminated and replaced by people raised from birth to lead a professional nation required in such an advanced era. Dzierzgowski's ideology advocates for a meritocratic society bound by a socio-biological sense of community, enforced by a strong rule of the monarch helped by vital youthful leadership of the best specimens, the utter destruction of democratic delusions and constant combating of disruptive foreign social 'parasites', all tied with the creation of an eugenic programme."

However, the most controversial aspects of Pelley's ideology concern his policies regarding certain minorities, such as Appalachian Whites, Deep Southern Blacks and Mexican immigrants, that have been deemed as 'unproductive'.

Such ideas led him to create the anti-Tammany Municipal Ownership League in NYC and then the Independence Party, calling for end to corrupt politicking, reforms and meritocracy with the help of a wide front of unionists, immigrants and established parties. While ideas like municipal ownership of public utilities and belief in meritocracy, although nowadays seen as support for the most successful wealthy individuals, stayed with Hearst he continued to slide towards conservatism. With the USA in crisis Hearst laid the groundwork for the creation of a new party, the National Democrats promising to combat social ills, substance abuse, crime, the red menace and most importantly the dread of the 'Yellow Peril'. Hearstian Democracy is a system in which the able entrepreneur is upheld as a role model, granted generous benefits of slashed taxation, trade unions are nationalized into a system dubbed 'American Corporatism', socialists, immigrant wastrels perpetuating drug abuse and any other crook are diligently caught by the politicized Federal Police. Beyond that Hearst calls for nationalization of alcohol, an idea influenced by the failure of the dry counties, the conquest of nature to build infrastructure and industry for the Californian Dream, and creation of the National Industrial Organization regulating wages and price gouging while promoting class collaboration. All of this tied with full control over the media, the state apparatus and international isolation, although any traitor and bandit beyond the border will not have the luxury of escaping Hearst's spirit, the same one that called for the war with Spain back in 1898."

Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them.

The very basic idea is that the royalty in elective monarchies does not ascend onto the throne by the grace of a divine being itself, but through a compact made by the influential classes and the nobility of their realm. The most famous examples of such entities in history have been the Holy Roman Empire, where the vast network of different feudal realms nonetheless ended up re-electing the same Habsburg family which monopolized the Kaiser's throne, and on the other end of the spectrum the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in which the king was truly subservient to the magnate class which not only held vast lands but also sway among the lower nobility. These two examples illustrate the inherent differences in how elective monarchies around the world are run, for some have become merely a facade that facilitates purely dynastical inheritance, although in a less 'autocratic' way due to the supposed consent of the electors, while in others the appointed monarch is nothing more than a figurehead for the grey eminance behind the throne to do as they please with. A less common, yet very peculiar, trend has also been the creation and transformation of previously existing governments into a sort-of 'crowned republics', where the monarch is chosen by what was formerly the political strata and ultimately serves the same purpose as any president or prime minister, just with the royal decorum instituted upon them."

At its core, Qadimism places a strong emphasis on the preservation and revitalization of traditional Muslim communal institutions. These include mosques, madrasas, and local communities (mahalla), which are perceived as the bedrock of internal cohesion within the Muslim society. Central to Qadimist ideology is a deep commitment to the Sharia, the Islamic legal system. Qadimists viewed the Sharia as not only a legal framework but also as a means of safeguarding the specific interests of the Muslim community within the Russian Empire. This involved a resistance to the encroachment of secular influences on educational and judicial institutions, which Qadimists believe would compromise the collective identity and cohesion of the Muslim community.\n\nQadimism stands in ideological opposition to reformist movements, such as the Jadidism, which advocate for modernization and adaptation to changing circumstances. The conflict between Qadimists and reformists revolves around differing interpretations of the roles and goals of social and cultural institutions. Qadimists argue for the administration and redistribution of wealth by communal institutions like mosques, emphasizing the communal welfare over individual accumulation of wealth. The movement also critiques the emergence of a new intellectual class, often educated in European or Ottoman universities, that promotes secularization. Qadimists express skepticism toward these intellectuals, perceiving them as a threat to the traditional social order maintained by religious leaders (Mullahs) and existing community structures. In defending traditional Islamic education, Qadimists resist the introduction of reformed \"Jadid\" schools, championing the preservation of the established way of teaching in maktab and madrasa settings. This resistance is driven by the belief that maintaining traditional educational methods is essential for the cohesion and well-being of the Muslim community."

Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century.

Sinarquismo is divided between two main factions, the revolutionary nationalists and national syndicalists of Urquiza, and the orthodox millenarians and assorted advocates of ‘Catholic Social Order’ headed by Abascal, while a small subfaction pushes in a more ‘moderate’ and semi-democratic direction by advocating either a union with the National Action Party or a transition of the National Synarchist Union into an official party of its own in order to garner wider public support, but both are moves detested by most true Synarchists due to their deep-seated hatred for democracy. Synarchists all agree that Leftism, Liberalism, and Atheism are the three worst things to haunt the modern world despite the other minor differences that divide them, and as such all factions seek to return to a more traditional and ultra-conservative platform under a supreme executive so that Mexico can be cleansed of sin, while also incorporating other varied ideas such as national conservatism, anti-populist class collaboration, Catholic theocratism, integral nationalism, Rightist communalism, and corporatist statism. Additionally, Synarchism maintains a symbiotic relationship with the Mexican Integralist movement as developed by Abascal alongside the great ‘cultural caudillo’ José Vasconcelos and Mexico’s surviving clergy and aristocracy, linking the two Far-Right political movements into one ‘Synarchointegralist’ coalition jointly aimed at saving Mexico with faith and fire while mixing ideas between the two groups - much to the chagrin of the Urquiza and his radical clique who now struggle in debate on the merits of republicanism with their new monarchist allies.

Maurism developed naturally as an alternative to the canovismo era, establishing itself as a regeneration of the conservative movement, willing to even engage in street brawls to further its causes. Maurism relies on corporatist, interventionists and nationalist principles, and despite attempts to woo workers, Maurism still draws most of its support from the middle class and right-wing intellectuals. Regenerationism of Spanish empire was also an important part of the ideology, and it occasionally took ideas from Charles Maurras’ Action Francaise. Maurism was never officially endorsed by Antonio Maura himself, and due to this rather loose association of Maurists, the movement developed into different strands, each associating with one another but differing rather significantly in political programs.\n\nGabriel Maura led a more liberal wing of the Maurists, Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo focused on the social Catholic wing of the movement while Antonio Goicoechea was perhaps the most radical Maurist, advocating for an “organic democracy”, anti-liberal and at times monarchist Spain. Maurism evolved into a somewhat cohesive movement with the formation of Partido Maurista, but the lack of unity has historically led to factionalism and formation of splinter parties.

The greatest extent of Integrist relevance was during the founding of Partido Integrista, and while the party has mostly fallen into irrelevance, it continues as a minor current within Basque traditionalism and Carlist extremism. Theorized originally by prominent traditionalists such as Ramón Nocedal and Juan Olazábal, Integrism differs from the traditional dividing lines of Spanish traditionalism, which usually are separated by the dynastic lines, with Carlists and Alfonsists theorizing on their own variations on traditionalist thought.\n\nIntegrists in turn do not have a selected monarch to support, and in the 1920s and 1930s the movement adopted accidentalism, an ambivalence to working within the frameworks of monarchy and republic alike, into their program, and as the movement has been sidelined by more mainstream traditionalists, aspects of mysticism and millenarianism have creeped into the movement, with some Integros even supporting crowning Jesus Christ as the symbolic king of Spain, to rule the nation as the end times approach due to the diabolic false gods of Syndicalism and Liberalism. In the view of Integrists, the ideal state is one made up of various natural organisms, be they trade unions, corporations or even family structures, and the state itself is merely there to ensure that this organism runs in practice.\n\nThe Integrists approach all social issues from the point of view of religion, seeing poverty, inequality and regionalist issue as the creation of liberal failures to create true equality in a way that a truly Catholic society would be able to achieve. In practice, Integrists believe in a state run by those most capable and pious to do so, as their electoral successes have proven that Integrists most often prefer the opinions of experts to those of politicians, and their mistrust of politicians is equally evident in their vehement distaste for any form of democratic organization. While not particularly different from mainline Carlism in practice, its stubborn disregard for solving social issues in any way other than religious one, and fundamentalist approach to Catholicism causes even traditionalists of deep faith from other parties to find the movement dangerous and frightening, if obscure, political force."

Charles Maurras contrasts the 'legal country' represented by the Republic and its elites, supported by the four 'confederate states': the Jews, the Protestants, the Freemasons, and the foreigners, the 'Anti-France', with the 'real country', which represents all the French people. Maurras' doctrine is based on the unity of society, a society that must function organically on the model of the Ancien Régime. The Action Française thus rejects the French Revolution and its consequences in order to establish a decentralized, traditional, localist and federal monarchy, with political powers concentrated in provincial assemblies with the King as the great national arbiter, while promoting Catholicism as the cement of national unity. On the intellectual level, Maurras emphasizes reason and Classicism and opposes Romanticism."

pataut_toryism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Toryism)§!\n\nToryism, also known as British Conservatism, is a broad family of traditionalist conservative thoughts and parties originating in the United Kingdom and her various current or former colonies. Despite the word Tory itself coming from a pejorative against Irish Catholics before being applied as a slur against supporters of King James II, Toryism later morphed into a colloquialism used to describe the major right-wing party in Great Britain. The ideological beginnings of British Conservatism are believed to be the Cavalier faction of the English Civil War, with later centuries bringing the influence of Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger. Policy-wise Toryism is characterized as highly socially-conservative, deeply Anglican, anti-liberal and very often pro-monarchist. In terms of the economy, it often fluctuates between supporting a free-market or protectionism, with many internal schisms fought over that issue. Because of the width of the label, some Tory politicians are hard to fit entirely into aforementioned criteria, which led to terms such as Red Tory or High Tory being spawned to describe such intricacies in policy."

pataut_agrarianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Agrarianism)§!\n\nDespite not being a concrete ideology with a central doctrine or fundamental tenets, agrarianism became a broad classification of various movements across the entire globe concerned with the interests and plight of peasantry as a whole. Supporters of agrarian parties range from large landowners or landed gentry to smallholders and poor farmers, from the lower high class through the most consistent support base among the middle class, and ending up on the lower classes. The origins of political agrarianism can be traced to the 'government of nature' developed by physiocrat and laissez-faire advocate François Quesnay, as well as the republic of rural virtue of Thomas Jefferson. While supporters of such parties hold the people of the land as a foundation of society and the most important part of the nation's organism, they differ wildly in their positions regarding economy, taxation, protectionism vs free trade, system of government, religion etc. Agrarian parties are generally conservative and traditionalist, although there is a sizeable contingent of radically liberal and downright socialistic groups, with some unconventional right-wingers mixed in-between. This wide range can be seen by looking at only a few rural movements, such as the German national revolutionary Landvolkbewegung or the conservative and monarchist Bund der Landwirte, the more centrist Czech RSZML or the Finnish Maalaisliitto, and even the radicals in terms of social changes such as Poland's PSL Wyzwolenia or Bulgaria's BZNS."

Given the immense variety of Spanish conditions within the boundaries of its international borders, with some areas like the Basque Country or Catalonia having a very distinct cultures and languages, the idea of federalism has been raised multiple times to create a nation that could unite these disparate groups while still supporting or tolerating their unique nature. During the process, a concept of a Spanish federation was created, outlining that the Spanish nation would be a hybrid, between pure federalism and centralist Jacobinism. During the first and second Republics of Spain, it was recognized that Spain as a nation was made up of various smaller states, with autonomy given to their regional actors and municipalities.\n\nThe Second Republic of Spain saw this idea transformed into the term Integral State, which would see autonomy granted to those regions that had an overwhelming desire for it, for example Galicia, Catalonia and Basque country. The Integral federalist approach has been utilized by various regional parties of Spain as well, with especially more conservative parties like Dereita Galeguista and Liga Catalana aiming for strong state level autonomy within an otherwise unitary state of Spain, imbuing local nationalism with a greater, more macro-level ideal of Hispanic unity, usually with some degree of Iberism mixed in, in rare cases involving Portugal in the greater Iberian Integral Federation. While the political programs of Integral Federalists may vary widely, and even the degree of federalism that different parties aim for may be completely different, the core value is the belief that Spain, as a nation, is inherently an unified concept, and that regional actors are better off under the wider umbrella of a Spanish nation than as a separatist, independent nations."

If one was to look for the origins of the idea they would find the French sociologist Émile Durkheim and the German Catholic economist Heinrich Pesch. Durkheim postulated a system dubbed 'Corporate Solidarism', which would eliminate anomies generating class conflict by reforming society according to the principles of organic solidarity. These would be ensured through the formation of single public institutions based on professions. Pesch, while holding similar believes, emphasized the crucial value of the 'Socialization of Persons' through labor unions, guilds and chambers of commerce. Heavinly influenced by heavily Catholic corporatists and himself influential on Christian Democrats, he envisioned a world of humanist international of patriotic states built on the pillar that is family.\n\nNowadays, the most influential group representing Solidarism would be the National Union of the New Generation, a party originating from a Russian youth movement growing up in the aftermath of the Civil War and Kerenskyist failures. Railing against the 'sins and prejudices of the past', thus limiting membership based on age, the NSNP hopes to transform their homeland into a tolerant civic nationalist state built on foundations of religious charity, societal cooperation, individual liberty and property, finalized agrarian reform and eternal vigil against socialistic radicalism. Although predominantly republican, there are some who hold monarchist sympathies, but both agree on the importance of democratic modes of participation. Among the Union’s most notable members would be Viktor Baydalakov, the party’s leader, and Arkady Stolypin, son of the infamous Tsarist prime minister. The NSNP is not the only solidarist organization, as one also has to note Verdinaso, the Union of Dutch National Solidarists, or factions within Norway’s Nasjonal Samling."

Additionally pulling allies in from the Christian and Agrarian Right while also defending the legacy of his father José Ladislao Terra who domineered the Colorado Party over a decade prior while focusing on such things as debt consolidation and other pro-farmer and landowner policies, Terra is a political chameleon willing to do whatever it takes to seize total control over the Uruguayan political system, and Terrismo is uniquely framed to match that opportunistic pursuit. Frequently quoting great figures like Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Otto von Bismarck, and even Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin in his grandiose speeches to the public, Terra and his personal ideology only continue to syncretize ideas once thought entirely incompatible. Despite being staunchly anti-Leftist in theory, Terrismo has also maintained many of the populist and pro-working class reforms enacted by the more liberal governments that preceded it in order to garner support from the masses, while Terra has also personally defended the ideas of cooperativism, seeking to impose this model into various areas of society, especially in regards to agriculture and Uruguay’s vast ranching industry, as well as other similar semi-Lefist ideas, even being the first elected Uruguayan to put forth an 8 hour work week by law well before he took power back in 1907. Strongly ruralist with an anti-urban bias, oppressively authoritarian with frequent application of state violence and police brutality, and revolutionarily conservative fusing faux-Leftism and syncretic Rightism unified via populism, Terrismo is a strange fusion of Uruguay’s political spectrum coalesced beneath the paternalistic might of its progenitor and sole adherent."

pataut_conservative_feminism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Conservative Feminism)§!\n\nConservative feminism is a relatively small offshoot of the larger liberal and socialist feminist movements, seeking to pursue the cause of women’s equality within right-wing conservative parties or organizations as an alternative to its more radical counterparts. Conservative feminists are often aristocratic or middle-class figures with local influence and wealth, and their advocation for expanded women’s rights comes from the mindset that while both men and women are equal, they are substantially different. Usually associated with the earlier maternal feminism, conservative feminists seek to uphold traditional values and ideals, often mixed with a degree of nationalism, and view the traditional family structure as beneficial to the rights of women. However, this defence of traditional institutions is not absolute, and the conservative women’s movement was often started as a criticism of how little rights women had within larger institutions, be they secular or confessional.\n\nTheir political platform usually advocates for expanded education, healthcare and voting rights to women, though usually in a more modest and incremental pace than their more left-wing counterparts. Conservative feminism often stems from traditionalist women’s groups associated with religion or cultural circles, but there are also cases of more revolutionary conservative women’s movements aligning with national populist parties in Europe and Latin America. Examples of conservative feminism vary greatly in their appearance around the world, with the European Catholic Action-associated women’s groups, French Ligue de Femmes Françaises as well as the American Women’s Christian Temperace Union of Katharine Bushell and Frances Willard being particularly prominent ones."

Starting out his career as a lawyer turned Conservative politician, the boss’ long road in opposition to the seemingly eternal Liberal dominance in Francophone Canada could not have succeeded if not for a willing alliance between the rising from Trois-Rivières, journalists weary of PLQ’s dominance and Catholic Church hierarchy wishing to restore sacred values in their province. One of the main tenets of UN’s vision for Québec is the rejection of 'progrès' as an inherent good, seeing tradition and morality as values that must be upheld against the onslaught of the socialist menace. This perception has resulted in harsh anti-unionist laws and enshrinement of Catholic conservatism into every aspect of society, with charity even replacing the notion of 'red' welfare beyond minimum wage old-age pensions. Despite his conservative origins, Duplessis has long been a champion of economic liberalism and minimal government interference, instead relying on outside business to extract resources and provide opportunities for the citizens of Québec to prosper monetarily. The chief issue for the Union Nationale is, unsuprisingly, Québecois autonomism and preservation of their unique status within the Confederation. Although Maurice Duplessis has rejected sovereignist and Québec’s independence so far, being accussed by Father Lionel Groulx of only perpetuating 'negative autonomism' based on privileges afforded by the 'distinct society', if the situation would demand Le Chef would carry the torch of patriotism towards an independent, and greater French-Canadian homeland. Neither his critics, who accuse Duplessis of plunging the province into the Grande Noirceur (Great Darkness) through a combination of press censorship and clientelist corruption, nor his supporters who view him as a populist common man who just wants to bring prosperity to his voters, know what the future holds for the Union Nationale’s boss."

Under the Chösid Nyi (both Dharma and temporal) a sacred incarnate, such as the Dalai Lama or Shabdrung, represents spiritual legitimacy while remaining independent of daily rule with a secular counterpart being responsible for taxes, law, defense, and diplomacy. In such an arrangement the chief abbot administers monasteries, education, and moral discipline, shaping society's spiritual center, all while his regent tends to the civic needs of the flock. Marked by constant ebb and flow of central authority, which is highly dependant on the court elite’s strength, regionalism has found a comfortable niche with penlops and dzongpons maintaining order through the use of local soldiers and forts. The dual system of government originated in the early 17th century when the Fifth Dalai Lama established a unified religious and civil government in Tibet; together with the implementation of the Chayik Chenmo legal code in Bhutan by the bearded Lama Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal. Over the ages the system evolved, with Tibet's Désid office disintegrating into the Kashag council and Bhutan establishing a hereditary monarchy in 1907 under Ugyän Wangchuk, combining secular and spiritual authority under the king which sidelined the Shabdrung.

Perhaps there is no one more aware of this than Shanxi’s ‘Model Governor’ Yan Xishan. Deeply affected by the centuries of humiliation suffered by his land, combined with the notions of Social Darwinism he came across while studying in Japan, the Governor came to the conclusion that only through the self-preservation and self-reliance built on a moral rehabilitation of the Chinese people can the decrepit and archaic structure enjoy fruits of social and economic reform. To this extent, Xishan started to develop his own ideology as none were deemed fitting for the task, and thus one had to combine the best elements of militarism, nationalism, anarchism, democracy, capitalism, communism, individualism, imperialism, universalism, paternalism and utopianism. Yan Xishan Thought can be considered, in some aspects, an updated vision of Dr. Yat-sen’s Three Principles, now replaced by Virtue, Knowledge, Welfare. The first aspect shall be attained through a Neo-Confucian revitalization, reinforced by self-criticism and self-cultivation, that breaks with the most backward and oppressive traditions like foot binding. The second aspect will require the implementation of basic public education for both men and women, enough to create a new society able to directly read the ponderings of their Governor as outlined in newspapers and books spread to even the most remote villages. The final aspect has to mix preservation of a weakened landed gentry and land reform with a Marxist-inspired, yet devoid of class warfare, central planning combined with notes taken from the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt and all of his successors’ 'Deals'. This pragmatic warlordism won’t be, of course, possible to exist without capable enforcers to preserve Xishan’s vision, and thus a comprehensive military reform has to be undertaken to transform the mass rural militia into a formidable fighting force schooled in a German-Japanese drill style. Additionally, multiple 'Heart-Washing Societies' shall be established, modelled after the success of Christian missionaries, that will ensure the Thought is followed anywhere Yan wants.

Further influences include the Neo-Platonic and Gnostic thinkers of Late Antiquity as well as the German Idealist philosophers of the last two centuries. These philosophical introspections are joined by a passion for new developments in the natural sciences. A mathematician at heart, Quisling is quick to latch on to discoveries that allow for the glorification of “great men” like Fermi, Einstein and his fellow Scandinavian, Bohr. This great foment of influences is all packaged in a neat historical gloss appropriate to Quisling’s lifelong passion for the humanities.\n\nThe result is a chimerical mixture of ideology, philosophy and science which Quisling believes will serve as a blueprint for a re-invigoration of the Norwegian people’s community. By overlaying the ideals of Universism onto the corporatist governance and Nordicist nationalism of the Nasjonal Samling, Quisling aspires to create a mass movement capable of establishing the “Greater Nordic Peace Union”, a superstate uniting the Anglo-Germanic people of Europe and the British Empire. The final goal of this project would be nothing less than the establishment of a global technocratic government. This world state would then achieve peace and stability through the codification of a meritocratic and intensely racialist hierarchy that foresees the Aryan races uniting to govern hand-in-hand with their East Asian counterparts."

With the imminent 'Dominicanization' of bordering regions, carried out through massacres of Haitian minorities, eradication of all socialism, the expansion of the tax base thanks to the migration of Japanese, Jews, and predominantly White Europeans, and the public celebrations of the 'Año del Benefactor de la Patria' - Year of the Benefactor of the Nation - among cries of ¡Viva Trujillo! the people shall remember who stands above them. Every citizen forced to hang a sign saying 'In this household, Trujillo is a national symbol' will realize that there is only 'Dios en el cielo, Trujillo en la tierra' (God in Heaven, Trujillo on Earth), with Rafael Trujillo perhaps even taking primacy before the Highest of All one day."

integralism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Integralism)§!\n\nPerhaps one of the most successful of the recent incarnations of Catholic social thoughts interwoven with politics, Integralism represents the child of the Portuguese monarchist thinkers inspired by the work of Charles Maurras and his Action Francaise. Sometimes known as just Integralismo Lusitano, or even Luso-Brazilian Integralism to capture the broader nature of the movement after it captured the South American giant’s right-wing, the ideology can be traced back to José Hipólito Raposo and his journal A Nação Portuguesa. Tradition, not mindless conservatism, is the main pillar of the Integralist ideology; one which is wrapped with banners of anti-liberalism, anti-masonry, rejection of parliamentarism and calls to destroy the corrupt oligarchs leading the particracy. The original incarnation of the thought which has taken root in Portugal calls for a Catholic monarchy which shall ensure an organic unity of all people through a decentralized corporatist system, although members such as Francisco Rolão Preto have been taken in by the vision of a right syndicalist flavor. The Brazilian one, on the other hand, puts a heavier emphasis on a stronger role of the capital - one that still upholds municipalization of the nation - and a 'Social Republic' constituted by a spiritually bonded nation that rejects the secularist notion of racism. Due to Plínio Salgado’s Ação Integralista Brasileira unwillingness to carry forth the monarchist torch some critics of the Brazilian strand see the Patrinovists of Arlindo Veiga dos Santos as the true representatives of the ideology across the Atlantic. Ultimately, even though it originated in the Lusophone countries, Integralism has taken the Roman Catholic world by storm, inspiring various groups starting from the Integrists in Renovación Española and even ending up as a source of influence for certain Irish monarchists."

The conduct of a theocracy is very often determined by the respective people's religion, and thus their differences vary intensively. Charitably communitarian clergies or opulent priests allied to local aristocracy, and all in-between, all easily exist beneath the umbrella of theocratic forms of government.\n\nFundamentalist Theocracies push their religious views to a notable extreme, likely believing in aggressive proselytization or a militant resistance to atheistic and heretical foreign powers. Alongside this view, such theocracies typically sanctify even formerly secular sections of the nation such as the military or civil service.

Combining many progressive policies such as the breakdown of old elitist institutions and sweeping land reform with nationalist and authoritarian tendencies shown in creation of youth paramilitaries, ideas of ethnic supremacist national rebirth, Savinkovism aims to syncretise both the left and the right, forming a true synthesis which would reform the nation and bring it into modernity. Despite progress being often at a forefront of their policies, groups advocating Savinkov's design often rely on traditional nationalist tendencies and dominant religions for support, although the clerical establishment is often sidelined or fought against, with some groups being even outright secularist. Ultimately, the most important aspect of Savinkovism is total devotion to the Vozhd and undying loyalty, with his followers being ready to execute his will by any means necessary. Although the ideology originated in Russia and is originally very central to that nation in its ideas, many populist nationalist movements, often led by youthful and charismatic leaders, around the former Russian Empire and even beyond have adopted elements if not an outright majority of Savinkovist ideals mixed and modified to fit with the local sensibilities."

If one was to look for the origins of the idea they would find the French sociologist Émile Durkheim and the German Catholic economist Heinrich Pesch. Durkheim postulated a system dubbed 'Corporate Solidarism', which would eliminate anomies generating class conflict by reforming society according to the principles of organic solidarity. These would be ensured through the formation of single public institutions based on professions. Pesch, while holding similar believes, emphasized the crucial value of the 'Socialization of Persons' through labor unions, guilds and chambers of commerce. Heavinly influenced by heavily Catholic corporatists and himself influential on Christian Democrats, he envisioned a world of humanist international of patriotic states built on the pillar that is family.\n\nNowadays, the most influential group representing Solidarism would be the National Union of the New Generation, a party originating from a Russian youth movement growing up in the aftermath of the Civil War and Kerenskyist failures. Railing against the 'sins and prejudices of the past', thus limiting membership based on age, the NSNP hopes to transform their homeland into a tolerant civic nationalist state built on foundations of religious charity, societal cooperation, individual liberty and property, finalized agrarian reform and eternal vigil against socialistic radicalism. Although predominantly republican, there are some who hold monarchist sympathies, but both agree on the importance of democratic modes of participation. Among the Union’s most notable members would be Viktor Baydalakov, the party’s leader, and Arkady Stolypin, son of the infamous Tsarist prime minister. The NSNP is not the only solidarist organization, as one also has to note Verdinaso, the Union of Dutch National Solidarists, or factions within Norway’s Nasjonal Samling."

Tracing their roots back to Russia's most powerful Black-Hundredist organization called the Union of the Russian People, the French extreme right League of Patriots organized by Paul Déroulède in support of 'Général Revanche' Georges Ernest Boulanger and the German National Association of Commercial Employees, Legionarism drew from these reactionary, highly militant, anti-socialist, anti-semetic and racially supremacist movements for inspiration. The greatest influences on far-rights' most popular strain after the Weltkrieg are Hungary's Gyula Gömbös and his Szeged Idea, while the most successful and widely emulated party is Romania's Legion of the Archangel Michael, more commonly known as the Iron Guard led by the mystical Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Legionarist parties put the people of their nation, often defined by a shared blood, a common folk hostile to the 'foreign corruptors' inhabiting their lands, on the forefront of their policy. They strive to achieve a mythical 'Palingenesis', a rebirth of their people united by common values such as shared desired for revenge, a strong faith sometimes expressed in a borderline mystical Church or the activation of the vital forces of the youth enrolled into fanatical paramilitaries sharing the renewed nation's guiding principle of self-sacrifice and martyrdom for the common cause. Economically, many have borrowed yet another thing from the ANI, that being Corporatism although other forms of reshaping the economy are also found. Above all, Legionaries detest and combat the 'internal enemies', be they communists, masons, minorities of all kinds and whoever else that has bewitched their pure state, one just now awaking, an element that some of the groups enhanced with scriptures taken from the Legione del Risveglio of the near-otherworldly baron Julius Evola.

occultism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Esotericism)§!\n\nEsotericism is a diverse label used to describe various regimes that incorporate Occultism within governmental administration, typically by shifting the qualifications for governance away from political acumen and towards knowledge of hermetic texts, among many other secretive tomes of antiquity. Esoteric regimes, being as broad as they are, have a wide range of influences that they take from for what the administration must be aware of or put into state practice, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism, and will often find themselves connected to movements of radical nationalism, with examples in the Ariosophists or some Druidists. Many of these regimes are additionally formed by members of Masonic sects or other old orders that stretch from the 17th century, with the others taking from more modern newly-formed secret societies. Ironically as well, various groupings of the aforementioned orders can also be in direct opposition to Esoteric governance, believing that bringing this shut-off knowledge to the public goes entirely against Hermetic traditions, or that involving occultism with the state will corrupt magical practices. Regardless of resistance, Esotericists are aplenty across the spectrum of religions, including Christianity and Modern Paganism. Despite these wide-ranging differences, Esotericists are commonly united in being described as intellectually or spiritually elitist in function, and are often skeptical of the less enlightened regimes around them. The most famous proponent of what came to be popularly known as 'esoteric nationalism' is Julius Evola, the Italian thinker who merged concepts of racial aristocratic elite, masculine heroism with pre-existing Western and Eastern spiritual traditions, chief among them Buddhism and Hinduism."

pioism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Padre Pio Thought)§!\n\nBased on the teachings and life of Pio of Pietrelcina, Padre Pio Thought or Pioism is less a formal ideology and more a way of life. Promoting deep faith and obedience to the Catholic Church while at the same time rejecting every form of ideology and even national identity, Padre Pio Thought seeks to create a society where everyone has the best chance to become a saint. It attempts to do this by promoting an incredibly decentralized model of governance, where local authorities make all major and meaningful decisions. The central government ideally would only directly control the armed forces and the educational system, having few other delegated powers. Pioism is by nature incredibly hostile to both Socialism and Nationalism, believing both play equal parts in the Devil’s efforts to prevent people from entering Heaven. As a result, Pioism seeks the destruction of nationhood itself, mostly by the replacement of national myth with an embracing of the Catholic faith. Along with this, Pioism demands the creation of a powerful welfare state, ensuring that all citizens have nothing to trouble them, so that all their energies can be focused on reaching the Beatific Vision. For non-Catholics, Pioism, while not directly hostile to their existence, still treating them as God’s children thus granting them the same access to social services, does not allow them to worship in public. It does not forbid them from worshiping in private, but being a non-Catholic in a Pioist government comes with a certain level of detachment from the rest of society. In short, Pioism seeks to usher in a new era of Catholicism, one where every human person has the ability to reach Heaven, even if it costs everything else. "

At its core, Ukrainian nationalism seeks to achieve national liberation and establish an independent and sovereign Ukraine. It emphasizes the preservation and promotion of Ukrainian ethnic and cultural identity, recognizing the unique characteristics, language, history, and traditions of the Ukrainian people. Within Ukrainian nationalism, there are different ideological currents. Active nationalism, influenced by thinkers like Dmytro Dontsov, underscores the organic unity of the nation, emphasizing traditional values, spirituality, and the primacy of the nation as the central unit of social and political organization. Ukrainian nationalism often propels revolutionary action, with grassroots movements, propaganda campaigns, and recourse to violence or armed struggle, aiming to challenge existing power structures and bring about societal change. Fueled by centuries of oppression of Ukrainians by various empires, Ukrainian nationalists are very militant in their struggle for United Sovereign Ukraine, where all ethnic Ukrainians are together, determined to defend their nation.\n\nWhile Ukrainian nationalism encompasses a diverse range of ideas and approaches, it shares a common thread of aspiring to the liberation, preservation, and self-determination of the Ukrainian nation.

Inspired by the anti-colonialist writings of Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev that opposed the traditional Marxist dogma that only the conditions of Western industrialized capitalist societies that true Leftism can be fostered, those who identified themselves as Kadrotheorists uphold the thesis that if a middle and upper class are never created in the first place, as is common outside the industrialized West, then class conflict as traditional Marxist doctrine envisioned can not come into being before the goals of national and economic revolution are achieved. And thus, these ideologues have distanced themselves from traditional Marxist-progressive dogma, and instead envisioned themselves as the heralds of an Ottoman Revolution that shall come about it in two-stage revolution: the battle to achieve the revolutionary movement’s surge to power, and the ongoing battle to liberate the economy and all of Ottoman society from imperialist influence. while being a third avenue towards national liberation free from the Left-Right divide, avoiding the pitfalls of capitalism, communism, syndicalism, or corporatism. Those who rallied behind the tendency dreamt of creating a united Turkish, or wider Ottoman state supported by Kemalist principles including secular statisma and centralist developmentalism, while promoting explicitly state socialist policies, such as a planned Leftist economy inspired by the Leninist NEP and Gosplan, and the promotion of non-ethnic social patriotism, or leftist civic nationalism where all contributing members of society, no matter their ethnic, religious, or cultural background, are considered true citizens aiding in the wider effort of anti-imperialist revolution and national rejuvenation. Despite employing reactionary-adjacent rhetoric at times, the Kadrotheorists have explicitly denounced Far Right ideologies such as Italian Legionarism and Maurassisme, condemning them as racist and imperialist ideologies designed to benefit the bourgeoisie of the industrialized nations, while lauding the Internationale for destroying the imperialist entities that were the French and British empires and for their continued committal to opposing the German colonial hegemon. However, certain Right-leaning theorists of the tendency have voiced their support for the Savinkovites and other anti-elitist reactionary revolutionaries of his kind, while also equally critique the Left, calling out the Third Internationale’s tendency to only focus on the industrialized world, as well as its paternalism at strongarming the struggles of the colonized world as secondary to the class conflicts within the industrialized West, showing the heterodox nature of the tendency.

Originating in the 1500s, the ideology has evolved and spread over the years throughout the wide lands that the English and their kin have settled, gathering traction in Republican and Monarchist movements across the lands of the former British Empire, but the ideology in all variations preaches the ‘truth’ that the Chosen Race shall replace the false Hebrews and the rest of the heretics and non-believers in order to create a true Abrahamic utopia in the image of God’s Paradise here on Earth. Furthermore, the ideology preaches that the British throne is the direct continuation of the Davidic throne of Israel and that the British Royal Family are the direct blood descendants of King David of Judah, that the Stone of Scone used in British coronations is the pillow stone of the bible that Jacob slept on and was later used in David’s coronation, that Britain and the United States are the inheritor’s of Jacob’s birthright through the Tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, and that most modern Israelites spread across the world like the Britons are not Jews. Supported by competing ideas of philo-semitism and anti-semitism depending on the sect, White ethnic supremacism, and a zealous adherence to cult-like forms of Judeo-Christian doctrine, British Israelism finds itself as the fringes of the Far-Right, with some forms of the doctrine being influenced by more esoteric and spiritualist ideas. Although Anglo-Israelism is claimed to be pseudo-archaeological, pseudo-historical, and pseudo-religious by its many detractors, those Chosen People of these pure and ancient Abrahamic races who truly know and truly believe in this Truth carry the once-lost legacy of the Ten Tribes to new heights in this modern age."

Virtually identical to offshoots like Anglo-Saxonism in North America, Australia, and Great Britain, Teutonicism in Germany, and Frankisism in Northern France, Nordicism and these thoughtforms all hold that the shared Nordic phenotype and culture are superior to all others in the world, and profess that the ambitions and needs of these races must be protected and pursued over the needs of any other lesser subhuman peoples. Viewing this Nordic racial group as the bastion of Western Civilization and true Human progress that revitalized Europe after the fall of Rome and gave rise to the modern age of European excellence, this fringe movement of the Far-Right is deeply tied to ideas of ethno-eugenics, anti-Semitism, 19th century Aryanism, and Scientific Racism and the racial sciences considered pseudo-intellectualism by many of those that detract the Nordic truth, but the specific politics and economics behind the movement ranges greatly, with Corporatist Populism, Right-wing Capitalism, Christian Distributism, and even National Syndicalism being popular in some circles, depending on the particular Nordicist sect.

Leopardos share the commitment to nationalism, militarism and corporatism with many other right-wing parties existing all across South America, yet they differ when it comes to racial issues. While most either espouse the superiority of the descendants of the Spanish Conquistadors or try to somehow integrate the native populations the Leopardos view the European 'Aryan' as the highest form of humanity. This has led the movement to support mass immigration of White Europeans to Colombia as a way to rejuvenate the nation and slowly replace the current inhabitants, annihilating the inferior Mestizo caste. Leopardos are ardent believers in the coming of the new race to Colombia and strive to bring a truly conservative revolution to South America and eventually to the whole world."

Once again influenced by Savinkovite groups, Yuri Shirinsky-Shikmatov believes that a top-down enforced identity would lead to nothing but disaster and while other ethnicities and nationalities have a place in the coming Pan-Eurasian project, the Russian nation is the only one capable of governing such lands and shall be considered the greatest group in the nation.

Citing that the Middle East is the Western edge of Asia and that North Africa was settled by these Asiatics as Islam spread across the sandy coasts, the Moorish Science Temple of America and its likemind Moorish-American Moslems believe that all Black Americans were stolen from these northern coasts during the slave trade, denying the more accepted history that most of the Transatlantic Slave Trade occurred off Africa’s western coatline and claiming that these are merely lies created by White scientists to keep the Moorish race under their boot. Aside from their strange theory on their origins and their Moorish aesthetic, seen in the way they dress with fezes and turbans and the new name suffixes they take like Bey or El, and their interest in the occult such as Egyptian mysticism and modern magiks based on Afro-Arab sources or other outsider theologies like Rosicrucianism, the movement largely adheres to more traditional ideas of Islamic Black Nationalism, seeing the Muslim faith as the best hope for African Americans if they wish to create a proud, independent, and prosperous civilization for themselves.

Dianetics itself revolves around the idea that survival is the basic principle of existence, and that the mind is made up of three distinct parts, with the reactive subconscious needing to be purged in order to free our analytical conscious and somatic mind, allowing humanity to spiritual evolve and become all-powerful beings under their own free will. Beyond Dianetics, Scientology is an ever-evolving thoughtform dictated entirely by the Hubbards through a perfected system of subtle propaganda, new dogma, groupthink, and mass manipulation as the Church of Scientology slowly takes hold of the hearts and minds of its followers.

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Seeking to create his own patriarchal and totalitarian Duvalier Dynasty that would rule over Haiti as a hereditary, semi-regal dictatorship festooned with West African and Vodou spiritual and cultural symbolisms, Papa Doc reinforces this dream with his own violent paramilitary the Tonton Makout - the Bogeymen of Haiti - who use mysticism and myth to hide their identities as they act as the dark specters of our nation while uplifting himself as the avatar of Baron Samedi - the Haitian Lwa, or God, of Death, leading a Vodou and Kreyol revival by force in order to fully replace ‘White’ religion that has long polluted the minds and souls of the Haitian masses, taking it so far as to use Haitian spiritual healing, black magic, and other practices to cleanse more and more facets of daily life of the European taint. With this spiritual nationalism being paired with brutal authoritarianism, a kleptocratic fusion of corporatism and corrupt capitalism, an immense cult of personality steeped in Vodou mysticism and occultism that holds Papa Doc as the embodiment of the state itself as well as the personification of the Vodou faith, staunch militarism and paramilitarism aimed at complete control of the public and narrative, and a dedication to Afro-Haitian exceptionalism and the wider Pan-African dream, Noirisme Éthéré may be ill-defined, but that matters not to Papa Doc has he holds Haiti in the palm of Baron Samedi’s hands."

Fusing occultism and Western esotericism with old European philosophies like Neoplatonism along with Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters - found all across the world but centered in Tibet - that have cultivated a great collection of wisdom and supernatural powers throughout the untold ages (such as clairvoyance, astral projection, telepathy, and flotation), and who now disseminate their teachings to the wider world through their chosen mouthpieces like Blavatsky. Believing that the Masters are attempting to revive ancient knowledge of a long lost religion that shall overshadow all other faiths in order to spiritually unite humanity under the all-powerful and singular god they call the Absolute in an emanationist cosmology that sees all existence as a reflection of this very being, active Theosophists work to achieve this global spiritual enlightenment and union by spreading their philosophy to all that will hear it while living ascetic and esoteric lives on vegetarian diets and under pacifistic guidelines, among other varied beliefs. However, Theosophy is unique in that it holds no official belief that all members must agree upon, completely eschewing the concept of dogma, leading to this syncretic thoughtform becoming highly varied as it has spread rapidly across distant regions ranging from El Salvador and New England to Nepal and Russia, and especially within India and America proper.

Emerging from the formerly Florence-based futurist group headed by Papini, Ardengo Soffici, Aldo Palazzeschi, and Italo Tavolato which came into direct conflict with the formerly Milan-based Marinettist futurists, Right Futurism has been deeply influenced by the Post-Decadentism movement, which promoted an aesthetic existence of excess and artificiality, alongside many others across the Italian political and cultural spectrum that mirror its creator’s own hectic, contradictory, and paradoxical journey through Italy’s upper crust. Borrowing at different times of his life from Catholic Social Teachings, Anti-Clericalism, Atheism, Individualism, Conservatism, Corporatism, Interventionism, Symbolism, Bergsonite Intuitionism, and Anglo-American Pragmatism to name but a few, Papini’s thought is no doubt highly syncretic, but still hinges on the core principle of rejecting and releasing all connections with the past in order to embrace a perfected concept of an idealized and aesthetically-perfect future outlined by Marinetti’s Manifesto del Futurismo. That does not mean Papinists are entirely aligned with the Left side of their movement when it comes to the way society should be engineered, for the major difference and the reason for the original split was the Florentine group's rejection of what they saw as Milan's 'immobile church with an infallible creed'. Existing as a distinct wing within the wider Republican side of the ANI, Right Futurists are the Italian Right’s controversial ticket to the prosperous horizon promised by the original concept of the Manifesto, albeit through a strange and highly chaotic vessel."

italian_legionarism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Italian Legionarism)§!\n\nItalian Legionarism is the guiding ideology, although quite ambiguous both in principles and application, of the Italian Nationalist Association, known as Associazione Nazionalista Italiana in the language of Dante. Originating as Italy's first properly organized nationalist movement, galvanized by various existing irredentist ideas and organizations like the Trento and Trieste Society, the ANI gathered a myriad of patriots with diverse backgrounds, both social and political. From nobles and bourgeois to even lower classes, be they ardent monarchists, radical democrats or revolutionaries in the national sense. The unifying principle was support for Italy's colonial-imperial and irredentist ambitions combined with a struggle against the 'ignoble socialism', sullying the national spirit by their pacifism. This has, to some extent, changed with the disastrous Weltkrieg, Italian Civil War, but also the brilliant example of Gabrielle D'Annunzio's Fiume Endeavor, organized in the confusing times between the definite end points of the great conflict. After the grand poet's martyrdom the remaining Legionaries and Arditi, combined with rightist nationalists and monarchists, rallied around the founders of the ANI. Those being, among many others, Enrico Corradini - the creator of the 'Proletarian Nations' concept, describing places like Italy where the spirit of the common people is in direct opposition to the oppresive 'plutocratic' world states, Ezio Maria Gray - proponent of a united Mediterranean project led by the renowned Italian State, Giovanni Papini - the chief of the Right Futurists after the definite split with Marinettists, Alfredo Rocco - the progenitor of the economic model known as 'Corporatism', and various monarchists led by Constanzo and Galeazzo Ciano alongside Luigi Federzoni and recent convert Dino Grandi. The last decades made ANI, while still a party-movement with clearly visible factions, a more unified front for all of the Italian Nationalists yearning to restore the greatness to their Patria, although some members have decided to struck out on their own such as the Ultracatholic 'White Flames' under father Reginaldo Giuliani in the Papal State or the duo of Giovanni Giuriati and Giovanni Host-Venturi, still active in the now-calmer Fiume, perhaps wishing to implement the Charter of Carnaro once again, a document which some in the main ANI have forgotten about."

Douglas that advocates the government issuance of debt-free money directly to its populace, both consumers and producers, to sidestep the issue of economic downturns and the chronic deficiency of purchasing power that has afflicted many post-Weltkrieg economies. Arguing that systems were made for men, and not the other way around, Social Credit seeks to bend financial rules and mainstays in order to ensure absolute economic security for its populace. Called pseudo-Socialism by its detractors on the Right and predatory economics bent on tricking the proletariat by its detractors on the Left, Social Credit Theory is frequently tied to ideas of Christian Distributism, Economic Syncretism, Agrarianism, and other ideas of the Christian Right, even including Radical Environmentalism when including the Kibbo Kift, and proposes a third path in order to create a safe and secure economic utopia for all within the system."

Such development may be induced by the government's increased radicalization or takeover by ultranationalist and far-right ideologues, ones which necessarily have to rely on a strong state apparatus to keep internal peace and secure the borders. National Security States are a final evolution of such processes, state-bound entities in which power has been relegated almost entirely to fanatical security agencies, or nations in which the chiefs-in-charge have decreed that the previous government is no longer able to maintain the national values and order. While the vast majority of the leaders of such states are generally concerned with establishing a 'Republic of the Strongmen', borrowing the Russian term 'Siloviki', some do genuinely believe in the gospel of the parties which had allowed their rise to power. That does not mean, of course, that an 'NSS' shall never break with any tenet previously established, for their main consideration is always how a policy shall ensure the continued national stability and prosperity for their group. Thus, these 'agencies with a state' pursue any and all means necessary to eliminate both internal and external threats which could jeopardize their ambitious mission of creating an ever-watchful nation-state, founded on the principles borrowed from many a rightist movement."

Both an eccentric naturist-naturalist and a Milanese aristocrat, Keller participated in the short-lived Endeavour alongside his closest associate Giovanni Comisso, coordinating the 'Office of Sudden Action' and gathering creative minds from across the entire world. In Fiume, he cooperated with followers of Communism, Anarchism, Utopian Proudhonism, Nietzscheanism, Rosicrucianism, and Nihilism. Among their many accomplishments was the establishment of the People's Academy, focused on encouraging debates about free love, abolition of money, destruction of prisons, and beautification of the city. Despite most members of Unione Yoga originating from Socialist circles, Keller and his followers became disillusioned with this mainstream, chiefly due to the collapse of Lenin's Revolution and the authoritarian turn of Western-based Communard nations. However, the greatest break was caused by Marinetti's alliance with the nascent Totalist movement in Turin, which only hardened the anti-Futurist stance of Keller who believed that theirs was an a-human technology cult, with Futurist art rejecting the most important aspect of creation - the originality and individuality of the artist. After the Civil War, remnants of the Yoga group alongside dissident futurists and legionnaires moved to Veneto to stage their rebellion of free spirits against the established order. The key positions of the 'Union of Free Spirits Tending Towards Perfection' are the creation of a non-racialist 'Dionysian Race' through the exaltation of individualism and free love, ardent anti-capitalism, libertarian activism, and the rejection of existing political systems and their values, alongside various other inspirations from Eastern spiritual traditions. While these are vague ideas and the entire movement is rather loose ideologically, it has garnered enough differences between members to cause a creation of two distinct factions. The first being the 'Brown Lotuses', promoting ideas of an agrarian democracy of small producers, anti-industrialism, strong devotion to nature and abandonment of cities. The 'Red Lotuses' serve as their opposite as a faction closer to avant-garde leftism emphasizing utter contempt towards the bourgeoisie and overwhelming materialism."

Sinarquismo is divided between two main factions, the revolutionary nationalists and national syndicalists of Urquiza, and the orthodox millenarians and assorted advocates of ‘Catholic Social Order’ headed by Abascal, while a small subfaction pushes in a more ‘moderate’ and semi-democratic direction by advocating either a union with the National Action Party or a transition of the National Synarchist Union into an official party of its own in order to garner wider public support, but both are moves detested by most true Synarchists due to their deep-seated hatred for democracy. Synarchists all agree that Leftism, Liberalism, and Atheism are the three worst things to haunt the modern world despite the other minor differences that divide them, and as such all factions seek to return to a more traditional and ultra-conservative platform under a supreme executive so that Mexico can be cleansed of sin, while also incorporating other varied ideas such as national conservatism, anti-populist class collaboration, Catholic theocratism, integral nationalism, Rightist communalism, and corporatist statism. Additionally, Synarchism maintains a symbiotic relationship with the Mexican Integralist movement as developed by Abascal alongside the great ‘cultural caudillo’ José Vasconcelos and Mexico’s surviving clergy and aristocracy, linking the two Far-Right political movements into one ‘Synarchointegralist’ coalition jointly aimed at saving Mexico with faith and fire while mixing ideas between the two groups - much to the chagrin of the Urquiza and his radical clique who now struggle in debate on the merits of republicanism with their new monarchist allies. Also holding tangential links to similar movements across the Catholic Right in places like Austria and Iberia through a shared adherence to the ‘Rerum novarum’ of Pope Leo XIII, Sinarquismo is the Mexican Right’s last chance to fully turn back the clock to a pious time before the Mexican Revolution."

Popularized as a natural response to Russia’s increasingly imperialist policies, the Altaians sought to distinguish themselves from the surrounding tribes and to cement their own distinct ethnic identity in the face of possible cultural annihilation by embracing the new faith en masse. Originally millenarian, charismatic, and anti-shamanic all in an attempt to completely revolutionize Altaic culture and society so that it may survive the sweeping tide of modernity, Burkhanism has adapted to drop much of these aspects, becoming more routine and more rooted in Altai’s pre-existing folk religion and shamanistic bases, while also coalescing around an institutionalized hierarchy of oral epic singers that serves as the clergy and theocratic administrative and judicial body of the faith. Overall, Burkhanist religious ideas are a syncretistic mix of varied pre-shamanist, shamanist, Tibetan Buddhist, Tengrist, and Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs, though it is not viewed as being a sub-sect of any of these larger faiths, instead being its own distinct thing largely focused on Altaic national salvation, though some forms of the faith advocate broader ideas such as unity with the Tuvans or even all of Pan-Mongolia. Controversially, Ak Jang has also been hijacked and further developed by the Kalmyk-born Mongolian warlord Dambiijanstan, aka Ja Lama, who sees himself as the prophesied reincarnation of the messianic hero Amursana while preaching a far more violent and ethno-supremacist bastardization of Ak-Jang driven by savage banditry and geared towards the total destruction of the Chinese as revenge for their past crimes against the Oirat-Altaic people of old Dzungaria and beyond, but aside from this radical off-shoot not recognized by the main high choir, the White Faith is largely centered in Altai proper while promoting far more agreeable and peaceful ideas aimed at ensuring that Altaic culture and their very way of life endures."

Settling itself between individualistic liberalism and 'degenerate' reactionary idealogues, the Young Conservatives desire to unite the nationalism of the right with the economics of the left, notably via compelling the Volk towards the vision of a utopic Third Reich. This supra-state would be led by a singular representative of the people's will, with popular participation maintained via the creation of various guilds and corporations.\n\nThis new state, especially per Moeller's definitions, would be guided by the principle of Prussianism and grant the German people an eternal destiny and community to be part of. Most notable, however, is that Moeller, and the majority of the Young Conservatives, have regarded this Volk as not defined by blood but rather by culture and history. This belief makes participation of other peoples in the idea of a German-led Empire available, one that would maintain respect for the various constituent autonomies and communities within. All of this is to be maintained, ironically, via an eternal vigil of constant motion. In the writer's own definitions, a true conservative must constantly work to keep the inherently valuable alive in changing times.

Supporters of agrarian parties range from large landowners or landed gentry to smallholders and poor farmers, from the lower high class through the most consistent support base among the middle class, and ending up on the lower classes. The origins of political agrarianism can be traced to the 'government of nature' developed by physiocrat and laissez-faire advocate François Quesnay, as well as the republic of rural virtue of Thomas Jefferson. While supporters of such parties hold the people of the land as a foundation of society and the most important part of the nation's organism, they differ wildly in their positions regarding economy, taxation, protectionism vs free trade, system of government, religion etc. Agrarian parties are generally conservative and traditionalist, although there is a sizeable contingent of radically liberal and downright socialistic groups, with some unconventional right-wingers mixed in-between. This wide range can be seen by looking at only a few rural movements, such as the German national revolutionary Landvolkbewegung or the conservative and monarchist Bund der Landwirte, the more centrist Czech RSZML or the Finnish Maalaisliitto, and even the radicals in terms of social changes such as Poland's PSL Wyzwolenia or Bulgaria's BZNS."

While the term 'panchayat' originated in India and usually refers to local village assemblies, the System was outlined by Prince Mahendra, son of King Tribhuvan. An ambitious young contender, the inheritor of the throne has long tired of his birthright being dominated by the powerful Rana dynasty of Prime Ministers, although that does not mean the Prince shares constitutionalist views of his father. The Panchayat System aims at reorganizing the entire Kingdom into a system of provinces, overseen by four-layers of assemblies and six classes, governed by a mass cadre of bureaucrats and officials representing party-less regime under which every decision requires the final approval of the monarch. In such way Mahendra would ensure that not only the old elite is swept away, but also that the republican radicals are rendered obsolete and driven out of the nation. The other key tenet of the Panchayat System is the elevation of the 'Three Pillars' of Nepali culture, shown in the expression 'Ek Raja, Ek Bhesh, Ek Bhasa' (One King, One Dress, One Language). The renewed power of the monarch, not seen since the days of the Father of the Nation Prithvi Narayan Shah, shall lead to a careful 'National Guidance' by the earthly representative of Vishnu, a man who wants to see the people prosper by introducing a grand land reform, industrialization, modernization of inftrastucture, improvements in education, and a modern healthcare system. While the opponents of the System deride Mahendra's vision as a chauvinistic absolutist ploy to replace the old elite with one loyal to him, the supporters of the Panchayat point out that only under Mahendra shall Nepal move past its feudal legacy and embrace a certain 'democratic' ideal in the literal sense of the word combined with a government type 'suitable to the soil' as the Prince described it."

Historically, Kritarchy has been linked to the government of Moses in ancient Israel, where Biblical judges ruled before the establishment of Saul's kingdom, but other examples throughout time have cropped up across the world, including the Druid judges of Brehon Law-era Ireland that ruled the Emerald Isle from the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE and its feudal replacement that lasted until the 13th century, the Gothi priests turned secular judicial leaders in the Icelandic Commonwealth between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Sardinian Judicadus that governed between the 10th and 14th centuries, and the briefly-lived kritarchy that ruled Frisia at the end of the Frisian Freedom in the 16th century.

Theorized originally by prominent traditionalists such as Ramón Nocedal and Juan Olazábal, Integrism differs from the traditional dividing lines of Spanish traditionalism, which usually are separated by the dynastic lines, with Carlists and Alfonsists theorizing on their own variations on traditionalist thought.\n\nIntegrists in turn do not have a selected monarch to support, and in the 1920s and 1930s the movement adopted accidentalism, an ambivalence to working within the frameworks of monarchy and republic alike, into their program, and as the movement has been sidelined by more mainstream traditionalists, aspects of mysticism and millenarianism have creeped into the movement, with some Integros even supporting crowning Jesus Christ as the symbolic king of Spain, to rule the nation as the end times approach due to the diabolic false gods of Syndicalism and Liberalism. In the view of Integrists, the ideal state is one made up of various natural organisms, be they trade unions, corporations or even family structures, and the state itself is merely there to ensure that this organism runs in practice.\n\nThe Integrists approach all social issues from the point of view of religion, seeing poverty, inequality and regionalist issue as the creation of liberal failures to create true equality in a way that a truly Catholic society would be able to achieve. In practice, Integrists believe in a state run by those most capable and pious to do so, as their electoral successes have proven that Integrists most often prefer the opinions of experts to those of politicians, and their mistrust of politicians is equally evident in their vehement distaste for any form of democratic organization.

Vibrantism as an ideology espouses a form of Catalanism, that is, Catalan nationalist and cultural movement, where the separation of Catalonia from Spain and Hispanishness in all its forms, be they monarchist, autocratic or republican, is the most important aim. The ideology is heavily influenced by Cardona’s own experiences within the Catalan nationalist movements, as during his collaboration with parties such as Estat Catala, he was often expelled for advocating for complete separation from Spain after more pragmatic actors accepted offers from Madrid for a more autonomist solutions.\n\nVibrantism is also inherently liberal and democratic, despite its militant and nationalist roots, as Cardona saw ideologies such as Totalism and Legionarism as the state imposing itself on the individual, whereas he saw his own nationalist thoughtform as the individual imposing themselves on the state. According to Cardona, nationalism is inherently social, not political, and it respects and preserves the being of the individual, the family, the municipality, the region and the nation. To him, nationalism is the preservation of the spiritual and human content of every social element. Vibrantism is also quite fluid in its support, as it tends to aim for an apolitical, trans-classist approach, seeking support from working-class nationalists as well, evident in Nosaltres Sols’ alliance with Partit Catala Proletari. Cardona considers nationalism to be an evolutionary trait of peoples, and thus incapable of being truly crushed even in the face of imperialism or disruptive ideologies of the day. This, at times paradoxical ideology, is slowly becoming more mainstream in Catalan politics after the inclusion of Nosaltres Sols in parliamentary politics, and it may very well see new evolutions to its base formula now that separation from Spain has been achieved."

natpop_conservative_feminism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Conservative Feminism)§!\n\nConservative feminism is a relatively small offshoot of the larger liberal and socialist feminist movements, seeking to pursue the cause of women’s equality within right-wing conservative parties or organizations as an alternative to its more radical counterparts. Conservative feminists are often aristocratic or middle-class figures with local influence and wealth, and their advocation for expanded women’s rights comes from the mindset that while both men and women are equal, they are substantially different. Usually associated with the earlier maternal feminism, conservative feminists seek to uphold traditional values and ideals, often mixed with a degree of nationalism, and view the traditional family structure as beneficial to the rights of women. However, this defence of traditional institutions is not absolute, and the conservative women’s movement was often started as a criticism of how little rights women had within larger institutions, be they secular or confessional.\n\nTheir political platform usually advocates for expanded education, healthcare and voting rights to women, though usually in a more modest and incremental pace than their more left-wing counterparts. Conservative feminism often stems from traditionalist women’s groups associated with religion or cultural circles, but there are also cases of more revolutionary conservative women’s movements aligning with national populist parties in Europe and Latin America. Examples of conservative feminism vary greatly in their appearance around the world, with the European Catholic Action-associated women’s groups, French Ligue de Femmes Françaises as well as the American Women’s Christian Temperace Union of Katharine Bushell and Frances Willard being particularly prominent ones."

The progenitors of the Nacionalistas could be seen among the advocates of positivist nationalism inside the defunct Partido Autonomista Nacional, later finding their place among many right-wing paramilitary groups such as the Liga Patriótica Argentina. Taking inspiration from Maurrassians, Spanish extreme clerical nationalists and even French Boulangists, Argentine Nacionalistas strive to preserve their nation from the influence of secularist & liberal Masonism, propagated by immigrants (most dangerous among them anarchic Catalans), Jews, socialists and unionists of all kinds. Thus, people gathered under the banner of organizations like the LPA have given their support to ceasarist republican figures like Manuel Carlés to combat the creeping modernist rot, one which already split their nation in half during the Patagonian Tragedy, putting the vision of redeemed La Plata even further away. Despite their penchant for an orderly society, for contemporary Nacionalistas Catholic corporatism can only be found insofar as the replacement of unionist activity and distribution of welfare is concerned, shockingly organized by women. Economically the biggest force on the Nationalist Right, the Patriotic League, has pushed towards free enterprise and liberalized industry without foreign domination. It remains to be seen if Carlésian nationalists can fulfill their vision of a purified Argentina while not having their position usurped by more militarist flavored groups."

Under the Chösid Nyi (both Dharma and temporal) a sacred incarnate, such as the Dalai Lama or Shabdrung, represents spiritual legitimacy while remaining independent of daily rule with a secular counterpart being responsible for taxes, law, defense, and diplomacy. In such an arrangement the chief abbot administers monasteries, education, and moral discipline, shaping society's spiritual center, all while his regent tends to the civic needs of the flock. Marked by constant ebb and flow of central authority, which is highly dependant on the court elite’s strength, regionalism has found a comfortable niche with penlops and dzongpons maintaining order through the use of local soldiers and forts. The dual system of government originated in the early 17th century when the Fifth Dalai Lama established a unified religious and civil government in Tibet; together with the implementation of the Chayik Chenmo legal code in Bhutan by the bearded Lama Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal. Over the ages the system evolved, with Tibet's Désid office disintegrating into the Kashag council and Bhutan establishing a hereditary monarchy in 1907 under Ugyän Wangchuk, combining secular and spiritual authority under the king which sidelined the Shabdrung.

Yiguandao traces its origins to one splinter branch of the Way of Former Heaven, later carried into Shandong and developed over the years by previous patriarchs, now presided over by its eighteenth one - Zhang Tianran. Also called the Persistent Way, the group focuses its veneration on the Eternal Venerable Mother (Wusheng Laomu) as the source of all in the cosmos, alongside other deities that act as guides during the apocalyptic times such as Matrieya, Guanyin, Xiwangmu, Nüwa and Guangong. Alongside Chinese folk traditions and rituals the group puts a renewed emphasis on the unity of the Three Teachings (Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism), incorporating Christianity and Islam to transform it into the Five Teachings, similar to Cao Dai’s syncretism according to some scholars. Upholding traditional, at times puritanical, standards of living viewed through a Confucian lens, the Yiguandao promotes vegetarianism, harsh penalties for alcohol and drug consumption and proliferation, upholding the Three Fundamental Bonds (The lord is yang, the retainer is yin; the father is yang, the son is yin; the husband is yang, the wife is yin) and Five Constant Virtues (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, trustworthiness) together with strict separation of men and women, going so far as forbiding unmarried males and females from talking in private. The start of the third era, according to the Honored Teacher, occurred in 1912 and continues to this day, as marked by the growing chaos and the culmination of human craftiness and deceit. Just as the divine reincarnation of Ji Gong in form of Zhang Tianran and the reincarnation of Yuehui Bodhisattva in form of Sun Suzhen know, the end is coming nigh as the millennium draws to its close.

However, the main foundations of the movement date back only to 1926, when a mechanic named Kullama professed that only through the saving grace of the holy trinity of Taara, the folk hero Kalevipoeg and his mother Linda - could humanity’s hopes be satisfied. According to the prophecy, the mother and son would soon awaken from a millenia-long slumber and restore unity among the Finno-Ugric peoples. This belief was quickly adopted by a myriad of neopagan groups, most famous of them being the Hiis Religious Association founded in 1930 by Jaan Org. While still relatively young and niche, Taarausk has proven itself to be something of a broad 'church' with multiple factions vying for prominence. In particular, the left-wing of the movement, led by Marta Lepp and the liberal Eduard Laaman, believes that all should be welcomed among the flock no matter their origin. A contrary point of view is held by the right-wing, led by Kustas Utuste and the historian Hengo Tulnola, who proclaim that only through a strong ethnic core shall the new faith persevere. Another contentious issue inside the movement is their diplomatic outlook, with some professing unrepentant devotion to pan-Turanism while others feel it is the duty of every Estonian to eject the Christian invaders from the Baltic wilderness. Nonetheless, what unites the faithful of Taarausk is a belief in a homeland free from any-and-all foreign influence, especially the Lutheran Church, coupled with a return to ancient tales reinvigorating the moral-spiritual shape of Estonia in preparation for the ultimate fulfillment of Kullama’s revelation."

The ideology is a mixture of the various influences of the thinker, starting with his love for the classical Galician literature renaissance or Rexurdimento, and evolving further with his growing interest in orientalism and occultism. Risco’s ideology espouses a strange form of Galicianism, taking ideas from a wide range of political thinkers, religious figures and philosophers, such as G.K. Chesterton, René Guénon, Mircea Eliade and, purely in the economic sense, Karl Marx. He is also a great admirer of Oswald Spengler and German Völkists, and has shown some interest towards the Austrian Ariosophy movement. To Risco, Galicianism has to develop into a pure, traditionalist form, freeing the nationalist movement from the ineffective parliamentarism and liberal decadence. To Risco, the modern man is a servant, a domesticated puppet to the corrupted European values. This poverty of spirit is the reason for the Weltkrieg, for only these hollow creatures could allow themselves to be dragged into such carnage willingly. Risco and his supporters reject modernity entirely, embracing irrationality and spiritualist new form of folk Catholicism, merged with Risco’s Hinduist and theosophist influences. The Galician nationalist has long since abandoned the idea of a linear history, and in his view, the European civilization is coming to an end in a fashion similar to the Hindu concept of Kali Yuga. In order to prepare for this, the Galicians must find their true faith once more. With this new decentralized religious shift must also come a shift in society, where men tear apart the Social Contract of Rousseau and dismantle the artificial cities created to shackle the people of Galicia, so that humanity can shift back to its natural forms of existence as parts of tribes and clans, with the Galicians returning to their true ancient professions as farmers and fishermen. Neo-Rexurdimento is also highly Celticist in nature, rejecting rest of Spain as ‘Mediterranean’ and ‘Semitic’, whereas to Risco, the the people on the Galician side of the Duero river are Aryan and racially superior to the rest of Iberia. The ideology is a highly malleable creation of Risco, and is bound to evolve as his position within the Galicianist movement fluctuates following the nation’s independence."

Also called “Universalism”, Quisling’s doctrine draws its name from the works of the renowned Sinologist, Jan Jakob Maria de Groot, whose work on East Asian philosophical and religious texts inspired much of Quisling’s thinking. Further influences include the Neo-Platonic and Gnostic thinkers of Late Antiquity as well as the German Idealist philosophers of the last two centuries. These philosophical introspections are joined by a passion for new developments in the natural sciences. A mathematician at heart, Quisling is quick to latch on to discoveries that allow for the glorification of “great men” like Fermi, Einstein and his fellow Scandinavian, Bohr. This great foment of influences is all packaged in a neat historical gloss appropriate to Quisling’s lifelong passion for the humanities.\n\nThe result is a chimerical mixture of ideology, philosophy and science which Quisling believes will serve as a blueprint for a re-invigoration of the Norwegian people’s community. By overlaying the ideals of Universism onto the corporatist governance and Nordicist nationalism of the Nasjonal Samling, Quisling aspires to create a mass movement capable of establishing the “Greater Nordic Peace Union”, a superstate uniting the Anglo-Germanic people of Europe and the British Empire. The final goal of this project would be nothing less than the establishment of a global technocratic government.

Pan-Iranism, from it onset, has always been a defensive and modernizing force, wishing to erase the barriers set up by intrusive forces which hoped to divide the Iranic people, be it in Azerbaijan or Khuzestan.

Korpela gained a solid following in the 1930s for his fiery and often controversial rhetoric, but it was only after one of his followers, self-proclaimed prophet Sigurd Siikavaara, joined the movement that it began to truly distance itself distinctly from Laestadianism and Lutheranism. Siikavaara’s vision for Korpelaism stemmed from the rise of syndicalism and the new translation of the Bible, which Siikavaara saw as the entry of the Anti-Christ on Earth, where he would spend 1335 days before the end of times. The followers of Korpela Movement would escape the apocalypse on a crystal ark, which would fly 666 members of the group to Palestine. As time went on, the ideas of Siikavaara began to grow more and more millenarian and esoteric, and Korpela himself broke with the movement completely. Under prophet Siikavaara, the Korpela Movement became a cult among the Sámi and Torne Valley Finns, who held massive sermons, clashed with the police and denounced all other forms of Lutheranism as heresy.\n\nSiikavaara was detained in a mental hospital for three years, and upon returning, started to espouse ideas of Korpelaism that truly veered off the course of Laestadianism, claiming that the Korpelaists were the only ones free of sin and thus could drink, gamble and practice free love among themselves. Siikavaara also preached that he, Korpela and a friend of his, Arthur Niemi, had usurped the places of the Arch-Angels to become such themselves. While the movement is heavily confined to the outer edges of Scandinavia, its increasingly confrontational attitude towards authority and cult-like following of Siikavaara makes it dangerous and unpredictable in the eyes of local police and political leaders. But to the disciples of Siikavaara, they are the last line of mankind against Satan and the non-believer Whores of Babel."

natpop_scandinavism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Scandinavism)§!\n\nScandinavism, or Pan-Scandinavianism, is a ideology that supports various degrees of cooperation among the Scandinavian countries first born among literary, linguistic, and cultural movements that has since coalesced and developed into the usual idea of total Scandinavian national and political unity, preferably peacefully and under a constitutional monarchy. Promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology, and a common language root and dialect continuum all stemming from Old Norse, Skandinavism seeks to utilize these shared roots and foundations in order to unite Scandinavia - namely Norway, Denmark, and Sweden - against the corruptive and chaotic forces that have begun to take over the wider world, allowing the Scandinavians to turn inwards together, focusing on the region’s own development and prosperity as they live sheltered away here up in the true North. Linked to the idea of wider Nordism as well, which espouses and extols the same virtues and ideas while expanding the scope to include neighboring Iceland and Finland, Skandinavism and its offshoots are less concerned with the political model on which it is based so long as the dream is achieved, though it traditionally has its roots in anti-absolutist democratic and monarchist student movements from the 19th century, and these roots have largely lingered. Regardless, the Pan-Scandinavian dream must be achieved, and through equal cooperation and shared destiny, the dream of a peaceful and prosperous Scandinavia bound by our shared Nordic Spirit will be earned as the Three Sisters gradually grow closer and closer together."

socialist_falange_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Socialist Falange)§!\n\nAs the most prominent force on the Bolivian ultranationalist right one would expect the Bolivian Socialist Falange to follow standard doctrines of similar movements from around the globe, yet the child of a great admirer of the military and lover of his homeland, Óscar Únzaga de la Vega, is nothing short of an ideological menagerie. Calling for a New Bolivian State, the party 'was born from the moral pain of a defeated homeland', and such the cells of university students which have served as its core see their movement as a challenge to adversity, but also an affirmation of resounding faith in the survival and glorious destiny of Bolivia. Seeking to challenge the oligarchic socio-political order present in their nation, the FSB strives to reform their society along lines which they see as the ultimate realization of the nation’s Catholic identity, with a one party state backed by both the Church and the military, such as General Bernardino Bilbao Rioja. Únzaga’s vision of 'Christian Democracy', however, incorporates many elements foreign to sympathetic movements in Latin America and beyond. Alongside the usual anti-liberalism, anti-Marxism, etatism and nationalism, the Falangist social justice willingly incorporates revolutionary syndicalism and the support of trade unionist organizations in their doctrines. Through a social nationalist revolution the face of Bolivian society shall be remolded, with those shunned by the existing power structures incorporated into a rejuvenated homeland, including the indigenous peoples of the Andes - as they have suffered more than others and understand the importance of the anti-imperialist struggle."

natpop_vapsism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Vapsism)§!\n\nTracing its origins to the gatherings held by former soldiers and 'freedom fighters' of the Estonian independence cause, Vapsism initially started out as a purely veteran affairs group fighting to improve their lot through financial help. As time went on, and the various miniscule organizations coalesced under the leadership of Artur Sirk and Andres Larka, Vapsid thought entered a new stage - clear calls for the establishment of a true Rahvusriik (National State). Based on universal values developed in the trenches and on the front, such a nation would not thrive on making divisions among all loyal patriots, but would instead promote an extreme form of civic nationalism. Such a vision can only be established by the consent of the people, and thus Sirk has called for the citizens to take initiative and spearhead the transformation of their state into a democratic-authoritarian presidential republic, one capable of establishing an autarkic state which redistributes Baltic-German noble estates and also eliminates class divides, ethnic chauvinism, and ideological parties. The Estonian utopia is still far away, but the participants in the endless war are adamant their vision shall come true."

trujillato_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Trujillato)§!\n\nIt is often said that absolute power corrupts, but what if the pursuit of rule itself was one’s goal from the very beginning? Trujillato is a term created to describe policies pursued by Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina, the pre-eminent figure among the shadowy world of political deals and military influence in the Dominican Republic. While initially making deals with figures such as Rafael Estrella Ureña to dominate the local political scene, Trujillo’s goal was always to create the nation into his own personal fief, which would be ensured by the creation of the Partido Dominicano - with the entity’s motto reflecting the aim to establish a cult of personality around 'El Jefe'. Rectitud (Righteousness), standing for Rafael, Libertad (Freedom), standing for Leónidas, Trabajo, standing for Trujillo, and Moralidad (Morality), standing for Molina; the PD was founded with the aim of bringing all citizens underneath the homeland’s sky in line, requiring 'los tres golpes' (the three strikes) of all - a personal identity card, a compulsory military service card, and a Dominican Party membership card known as 'La Palmita'. Despite promising to democratize the nation through a reinvigorate system of republican and civil democratic governance, any-and-all opposition was forced to flee or disappeared under mysterious circumstances, with the wider population and even the armed forces shackled by rotational clientelism and an atmosphere of terror and forced devotion, ensured through the creation of the Servicio de Inteligencia Militar. Although there are certain reforms which may seem beneficial on paper, be it the elimination of external debt, industrialization, outreach to the Church, reconstruction of the capital, and even environmental protection they all have but one goal; the enrichment of the Trujillo familia. The businesses are staffed by loyalists, the forests are destroyed only under the companies given such tasks by the Boss, the centre of government is to be rebuilt as Ciudad Trujillo, and Catholicism is used as means of legitimizing the regime. With the imminent 'Dominicanization' of bordering regions, carried out through massacres of Haitian minorities, eradication of all socialism, the expansion of the tax base thanks to the migration of Japanese, Jews, and predominantly White Europeans, and the public celebrations of the 'Año del Benefactor de la Patria' - Year of the Benefactor of the Nation - among cries of ¡Viva Trujillo! the people shall remember who stands above them. Every citizen forced to hang a sign saying 'In this household, Trujillo is a national symbol' will realize that there is only 'Dios en el cielo, Trujillo en la tierra' (God in Heaven, Trujillo on Earth), with Rafael Trujillo perhaps even taking primacy before the Highest of All one day."
nacismo_subtype:0 "Nacismo"
nacismo_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Nacismo)§!\n\nConstituting one distinct, if somewhat vague, branch within the wider Chilean nationalist camp the ideological child of Carlos Keller Rueff and Francisco Javier Díaz Valderrama tries to combine home-grown strands with the long legacy of Germanic influence. Nacismo, as the beliefs of the Acción Nacionalista de Chile have come to be dubbed, takes the racial theories of Nicolás Palacios - that the superiority of Chileans originate from Visigothic scions mixed with war-like Mapuches, Francisco Antonio Encina - that the dillution of Spanish blood caused degeneration of aritoscracy into liberal arts instead of industrious pursuits, and Alberto Edwards - that gentrification caused the nobility to become detached from reality of the socio-economic crisis; and melts them with unique contributions of Keller and Valderrama-translated works of the German Völkists, Conservative Revolutionaries and the Austrian DAP. Galvanizing the support of the Deutsch-Chilenen and assorted Germanophiles disgusted by the Syndicalist revolution, the ANCh has become the banner around which cries for a restored fatherland rally. This can be only accomplished through the elimination of all forms of syndo-communism and transnational capitalism, the rejection of liberal thinking and parliamentarian delusions in favor of a strong one party national-corporatism, and establishment of a  state which embodies true values of social justice and humanistic labor. Of course, the condition of Chile at the present moment does not allow such reforms to be carried out, and thus a purification and strengthening of the fundaments must be accomplished. All worthless foreigners, the Jews being the worst culprits, shall be expelled while White Nordics are invited to heal the racial soul of the nation - through which natural order and ancient hierarchy established by the conquistadors return. Ultimately, the Nacistas claim to merely want to return to the true vision of His Excellency Diego Portales, a unitary authoritarian presidential republic where the upper class dictates how the future is shaped."

lapuanliike_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Lapuanliike)§!\n\nThe flatlands of Ostrobothnia have since time immemorial housed the rebellious sons of Finland, from the mythical Lalli, murderer of Saint Henrik on the ice of Lake Köyliö to Jaakko Ilkka’s peasant militias of the Cudgel War who rose against the Iron Marshall Klaus Fleming. As the German monarchy of Finland found itself struggling against the tide of radicalism and syndicalism in Finland, it was once more the sons of Pohojanmaa who rose to challenge this rotten institution and its lackeys, the city elites. From the heartlands of Western Finland, men gathered to the town of Lapua to heed the words of Vihtori Kosola, claiming that a righteous, patriotic rebellion was better than patriotic anarchy. Lapuanliike was born on the titular town, moulded by Kosola and his allies as a means to channel the last gasp of the dying Finnish countryside against the godless cities and faithless elites. Finland would return to an age of the Jägers and White Guards who fought and bled for an independent nation free from the clutches of Sweden, Russia or Germany. This new White would help build a strong, agrarian and deeply pious nation, capable of liberating the territories of Greater Finland from the Russian menace. Drawing inspiration from the Italian and Romanian legionaries, the movement puts illegal action for the preservation of the nation and the will of the people as its highest calling, and while the movement has always sought to attract the support of more moderate right-wing parties, not even the prime minister of Finland is safe from the kidnappings performed by the Lapua Movement. Kosola himself has long struggled to contain the rising radicalism of the Lapua Movement, and often remarks that he has the power to allow and order his supporters, but never to forbid them from pursuing an action. However, for all the insurrectionist rhetoric and violence of the Lapua Movement, there is an internal schism on whether such a bold move can be taken, and what the resulting takeover would entail. Some wish for a God-ordained dictatorship of Kosola, while others see a bicameral, strong presidential republic ruled by the Whites as a way to finally put the betrayed hopes of the civil war into reality. Both sides agree that it is only through the total expulsion of the Germans, the Marxist social democrats and the feckless political moderates that the supremacy of true Finnishness, that of the stubborn and proud rural peasant, achieved."

Instead of having mercy and understanding that children can do a few naughty things but still be nice at heart, Toy Santaism views even one naughty act as deserving of coal, or worse.

But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello but I think Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip To Be Square,' a song so catchy that most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's a a personal statement about the band itself."

### Subtype Descriptions ###
totalist_subtype_desc:0 "The term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. Totalism is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarization, centralization, and totalitarian transformation of society."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."

natsynd_subtype:0 "National Syndicalism"
natsynd_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Syndicalism)§!\n\nOftentimes referred to as Charter Totalism or even just Totalism, National Syndicalism describes an ideology that seeks to centralize the usually decentralized Syndicalist system around a strong central executive or authoritative body while supported by Nationalist tendencies. Pioneered by the likes of Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois, and Benito Mussolini, among other signers of the Totalist Charter, this new form of authoritarian Syndicalism seeks to safeguard the Revolution through any means necessary without allowing the weak and disorganized nature of decentralized government becoming an obstacle to national progress."
authcom_subtype:0 "Communism"
authcom_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Communism)§!\n\nThe term 'Communism' is usually used to designate one of the main alternatives to orthodox French and English Syndicalism in the modern Socialist world. Based on the writings and thoughts of Marx, Engels and Lenin, the varied ideology - commonly also called Marxism, Lenininsm, or Marxism-Lenininsm to honor its main ideaologues and to distinguish it from other new alternative pathways to the shared Communist idyll like Broad Communism, National Communism, or Anarcho-Communism -  promotes revolution as a means of seizing power led by a vanguard party operating on the principles of democratic centralism composed of professional revolutionaries, representing both workers and peasants, who would establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, a phase of Socialism serving as a transition from the Capitalist bourgeois society to the ideal classless and stateless society: the Communist society. During this phase of Socialism the means of production would be transferred from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat. The tendencies within the Leninist current may differ, but all Communists are united in their struggle for a better world for the proletariat of the whole world."
sorelianism_subtype:0 "Sorelianism"
sorelianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Sorelianism)§!\n\nComposed on the teachings and writings of French Revolutionary Georges Sorel, Sorelianism seeks the creation of a deeply centralized National Worker's State with the framework of Revolutionary Syndicalism. While seemingly highly contradictory, Sorelianism is one of the more popular forms of national syndicalism within post-Revolution Western Europe, making it's viability as a sustainable ideology quite good."
national_communism_subtype:0 "National Communism"
national_communism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Communism)§!\n\nCombining aspects of Nationalism and Patriotism with Socialist and purely Communist practices, National Communists seek to progress towards a truly Communist society - as dictated by Marx and Engels - while supported by a fervent nationalist identity. Seizing the means of production for the Proletariat while bolstering a national identity for all in the nation to adhere to and find pride in, ‘NatComs’ hold that only through the elevation of their unique national identity can true Communism be achieved, wholly distinct from commonly held ideas of Internationalism and Pan-Leftist unity. In these states, the nation and the people - and in turn their unique journey towards Communism - are distinct from the wider international Proletariat, and as such, it is these people that hold priority as their nations build up a Socialist society."
technocratic_socialism_subtype:0 "Technocratic Socialism"
technocratic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Technocratic Socialism)§!\n\nTechnocratic Socialist believe in a system where the nation's decision-making is left to an unelected ruling class of technical experts. Technocratic governments often prioritize science and scientific advancement and are opposed to reactionary and primitive systems of government"
georgian_socialism_subtype:0 "Georgian Socialism"
georgian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Georgian Socialism)§!\n\nGeorgian Socialism is a term for the fiercely nationalistic, expansionist and Anti-Russian ideology of Georgia. Georgian Socialism is an ideology unique to the Caucasus Region, and represents the people with its values of strength, self sufficiency and brotherhood."
mladorossi_subtype:0 "Social Monarchism"
mladorossi_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Social Monarchism)§!\n\nWhile Monarchism and Socialism are typically contradictory ideologies, several movements have embraced a seemingly impossible mix of Monarchism and Socialism. Movements such as the Mladorossi - who call for a form of ‘Labor Monarchy’ - are followed by many other varied Socialist regimes who have decided to keep their Monarchs around as figureheads, though some rare examples of a monarch truly invested in the Socialist system do exist. The Mladorossi themselves seek to combine ideas of Russian Monarchism with the Soviet Socialist system, fusing Marxist principles with Russian Nationalism and Traditionalism under the embrace of a Red Crown and Aristocracy and united by Orthodox faith."
autocratic_socialist_subtype:0 "Autocratic Socialism"
autocratic_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Autocratic Socialism)§!\n\nAutocratic Socialist regimes are highly authoritarian dictatorships that (at least on paper) adhere to socialist principles. They are notably varied, but can usually be seen with some form of command economy, emphasis on militarism, are often nationalist or use patriotism as a tool of the state, and are frequently at odds with more mainline Charter Totalists. While their commitment to Socialist revolutionary principles is usually questionable at best, these regimes still maintain socialism as the official state ideology, and go to lengths to paint their government red - even if the government is nothing short of a total dictatorship."
red_junta_subtype:0 "Red Junta"
red_junta_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Red Junta)§!\n\nMilitary Dictatorships come in many forms, including Military Dictatorships that have a significant left-lean. These regimes in particular are highly authoritarian, militaristic and stratocratic, while still maintaining Socialist principles."
caponism_subtype:0 "Mafioso Socialism"
caponism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Mafia Socialism)§!\n\nMafioso Socialism, often just called Caponism or Caponeism after its leading ‘theorist’, is the ideology ascribed to notable crime lord and pseudosocialist Alphonse Capone, who rose to political prominence within the American Socialist movement during the Civil War. Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."
juche_subtype:0 "Juche"
juche_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Juche)§!\n\nA totalitarian ideology unique to the Far East, Juche describes a syncretic variant of National Syndicalism incorporating and emphasizing ideas, practices, and motifs of Marxism, Nationalism, Militarism, Autarkism, and even Monarchism. Claiming that only through total self-sufficiency and with total devotion to the one Supreme Leader can the nation truly achieve real Socialism, and eventually, utopia. Harsh towards any form of Liberalism, Counter-Revolutionary action, or any other ideas deemed an obstacle to the state, only through total loyalty to the Party and to the Supreme Leader can one reap the benefits of the state, and all those who fail in these duties are branded enemies of the state without remorse."
nazbol_subtype:0 "National-Bolshevism"
nazbol_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National-Bolshevism)§!\n\nNational Bolshevism is a similar ideology to mainline Totalism, but instead of aiming for a Syndicalist system built entirely around unions, it instead adheres to the Bolshevik system espoused by the Soviets during the Russian Civil War and beyond. Combining Nationalism with Marxist-Leninism to varying degrees, these syncretic Socialist believe that only through patriotism, national fervor, a planned and nationalized economy, and adherence to the ideas of Marx can true Communism be achieved."
obammunism_subtype:0 "Obamaism"
obammunism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Obamaism)§!\n\nObamaism, sometimes called Obama Thought, Spiritual Pan-Africanism, Maumauism, or even ‘Obamunism’, describes the specific form of Pan-Africanism pioneered by Onyango Obama of the Mau-Mau. Combining the esoteric spiritual beliefs of the Mau-Mau group that raises Obama as the physical manifestation of their patron deity the ‘Ghost Goat’ with occultist practices, witchcraft, shamanism, Socialist Pan-Africanism, and Pan-African Nationalism, this syncretic ideology is unique in its outlook on the traditional Pan-African cause. Calling for cooperation and unity between all peoples of African under a totalitarian but benevolent Socialist hereditary theocracy under the prophet Obama that is backed by a strong volunteer and fanatically devoted military and supported by an economy vaguely resembling autarkic Agrarian National Syndicalism mixed with traditional tribalist practices, Obamaism is a ideology that could only be forged in the melting pot of chaos and extremism that is colonial Africa."
germanic_socialism_subtype:0 "Germanic Socialism"
germanic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Germanic Socialism)§!\n\nThe term 'Germanic Socialism' refers to the ideology unique to Germany theorized by Paul Lensch and his political party the GSVP. Drawing on the writings of Oswald Spengler, Volkist theses and the policies of the Iron Chancellor Bismarck and of the Soldier-King Frederick William I while rejecting classical Marxist and socialist theories, this ideology places Germany as a unique nation in the world, a symbol of the Proletariat fighting against bourgeois nations such as France and Britain. Germanic Socialism therefore promotes the unity of the German people within a single Pan-Germanic state, united by the central figure of the 'Volkskanzler', guardian of the Germanic Tradition and of the People's Empire. The economy of the German Socialist state is organized in a corporatist manner, with national industries and private enterprises working hand in hand. The atypical positions of Germanic Socialism have led to its condemnation as reactionary and pseudo-socialist by the vast majority of the world's socialist movements, although it has found some adherents among both the upper and lower classes in Germany."
left_eurasianism_subtype:0 "Left Eurasianism"
left_eurasianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Eurasianism)§!\n\nBased on a philosophical and political thought of Nikolai Trubetskoy and Peter Savitsky, Left Eurasianism has been radicalized and tied together with traditional Russian popular socialism and Narodism. Criticizing the Orthodox Eurasianism for its reactionary conservatism, the Left Eurasianism emphasizes a revolutionary all-Eurasian movement and liberation of all Eurasian peoples under rule of a socialist party."
jacobinism_subtype:0 "Jacobinism"
jacobinism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Jacobinism)§!\n\nBorrowing its name from the 'Society of the Jacobins, Friends of Freedom and Equality', Jacobinism is an authoritarian socialist ideology developed by camarade Maurice Thorez. Drawing from the policies instituted by Maximilien Robespierre as well as the writings of Vladimir Lenin, Jacobinism seeks to create a truly revolutionary regime, seeing violent social action as the core of the French spirit. Followers of Thorez are ready to strike down any agent they deem as anti-socialist, be they reactionaries or false socialists, in their pursuit of 'Communism with French Characteristics'."
esoteric_leninism_subtype:0 "Left Roerichism"
esoteric_leninism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Roerichism)§!\n\nLeft Roerichism - also called Leftist Agni Yoga Thought, Esoteric Leninism, or Buddho-Communism - is a mutation of the original ‘Rerikhism’ of Nicholas Roerich and his wife Helena inspired by the whispers of the mahatmas and the impressive humanitarian efforts of Vladmir Lenin and other prominent Socialists across the world that have fought to free humanity from oppression. Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."
tot_afrofuture_subtype:0 "Afrofuturism"
tot_afrofuture_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Afrofuturism)§!\n\nAfrofuturism is a newly created thoughtform advocating for Pan-Africanism, African Nationalism, and Populism for the African people while advancing towards a Futurist cultural revolution, though what it defines as ‘African’ varies greatly. Linked to various other ideological movements from National Syndicalism to Black Supremacism to Afrocentric Pacifism, what it means to be African in the Afrofuture can vary, but being declared a true African in any Afrofuturist society grants all the populist benefits such a title could bring. Usually radical and fiercely devoted to its Pan-African and Futurist goals bordering on millenarianism or zealotry, these groups will stop at nothing to achieve the Afrofuture."
left_townerism_subtype:0 "Left-Townerism"
left_townerism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left-Townerism)§!\n\nTaking Towner’s ideology and injecting it with ideas of National Syndicalism and Esoteric Nationalism, Dixonism is the brainchild of Chief New Moon, the disciple of Elwood Towner. Far more militarist and extremist than Townerism, Dixonism calls for the outright massacre or imprisonment of all non-Native souls in North America while promising a red-tinted National ‘Socialist’ utopia for all true Red Men."
popcom_subtype:0 "Popular Communism"
popcom_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Popular Communism)§!\n\nPopular Communism, nicknamed ‘Apple-Pie Communism’ or just Browderism by its loyal adherents in the Americas, is a form of centralized, semi-Authoritarian Socialism that features a strong executive while also working to build a united Left front in order to foster Pan-Leftist unity and cooperation. A mix of Authoritarianism and pure Socialist Democracy, Popular Communism seeks to safeguard the Revolution without resorting to infighting, excess violence, brutal repressions and reprisals, and other inhumane practices. Supported by craft unions and guilds but against communization and Anarchist-influenced cooperatives, Popular Communism centralizes the economy and the state in sound hands while still allowing self-management and autonomous freedoms for the working class, and usually seeks to find a balance between Agrarian and Industrialist pursuits."
tot_left_panafricanism_subtype:0 "Left Pan-Africanism"
tot_left_panafricanism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Pan-Africanism)§!\n\nLeft Pan-Africanism, sometimes penned as Pan-Afrikanism, Panafrikanism, or Panafrianism, describes a diverse group of ideas and movements all centered around the idea of Pan-African unity. Oftentimes including the African Diaspora as well as just the African continent, this usually Nationalist and varyingly Socialist ideology usually seeks to promote either total political and even cultural unity between African groups under an array of Leftist ideas, or just cooperation and comradery between ethnonationalist sects each promoting their unique identities in their own Socialist states. Though not inherently, Left Pan-Africanism is frequently militaristic, and each particular strain’s dedication to the wider World Revolution or other Leftist goals outside Africa is varied, but not all are so solely concerned on African-only affairs. Widespread across much of Africa and the wider Black Diaspora, it has been pioneered by figures such as Onyango Obama, Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, and many others, and is one of the fastest growing new ideologies on Earth."
tot_authentice_subtype:0 "Authenticité"
tot_authentice_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Authenticité)§!\n\nAuthenticité, sometimes called Nzereianization or Nzereism, is the state ideology of Nzere as crafted and personally described by Bobozo Sese Seko. Pan-African in nature, calling for the cooperation between ethnonationalist African groups without political unity, Authenticité calls for a ‘return to authenticity’ as the name suggests. This return is characterized by Congolese Nationalism, a revival of African aesthetics and identity, the total rejection of anything European or ‘Western’, Corporatism, and ethnically-tied Socialism for its loyal African proletariat."
hoxhaism_subtype:0 "Hoxhaism"
hoxhaism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Hoxhaism)§!\n\nHoxhaism, sometimes called Albanian Leninism, is the ideology championed by Enver Hoxha, the young leader of the vanguardist faction of the Revolutionary National Committee. Hoxha's ideology slowly developed throughout the years he spent in Paris and also traveling around the various headquarters of European socialist parties. With time he came to believe that Anarchists, Syndicalists, Sorelians, Jacobins and Charterites are nothing but traitors to the revolutionary struggle, one which Vladimir Lenin was the greatest champion of. Thus, Hoxhaists' main goal is the preservation of V.I. Lenin's legacy and creation of the most scientific and anti-revisionist form of Marxism-Leninism. They also combine that with a fierce drive to transform Albania into a truly communist country, reforge its culture from a reactionary mess of contradictions into a proud socialist-patriotic tradition. Furthermore, followers of Hoxha will not rest until any and all forms of revisionism and right-leaning traitors inside and outside the party are dealt with."

ultra_hoxhaism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Ultra-Hoxhaism)§!\n\nBorn after the tragic death of Albania's late supreme leader, Ultra-Hoxhaism or Enverism-Nexhmijeism is the product of the sorrow and rage of Hoxha's widow Nexhmije. Ultra-Hoxhaism views life after the death of Enver as an eternal struggle against revisionists, resulting in the creation of an all-reaching totalitarian state that sees endless purification of the socialist society as the only answer after Enver's murder. Nexhmijeists will not rest until every traitor, not just in Albania but across the entire world, is punished for trying to shatter Hoxha's grand dream. A socialist paradise towards which Ultra-Hoxhaism strides ever so boldly."
tot_paneuropeanism_subtype:0 "Left Paneuropeanism"
tot_paneuropeanism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Paneuropeanism)§!\n\nLeftist Paneuropeanism takes the nationalist and normally reactionary ideology of Pan-European thought and fuses it with Socialist rhetoric. Serving as the main alternative to its non-nationalist rival Trotskyism, Leftist Pan-Europeanism seeks to bend and narrow the idea of Leftist Unity and Globalist or Internationalist thought towards a specifically Euro-centric direction, uniting the heart of the Western World under a crimson banner with nationalism and cultural exceptionalism. Uplifting one or a few specific cultures in Europe, or uplifting them all into a cohesive whole, the ‘nationalist’ aspect of Left Pan-European thought can vary greatly as different groups push cultural nationalism, civic nationalism, ethnic nationalism, or other identities to rally around and divide by. Though many Leftist Paneuropeans differ in which specific type of Socialism they wish to unite Europe under, from Communism and Syndicalism to Social Nationalism and Democratic Socialism, all Paneuropeans can agree that the Europe must be protected and preserved under the light of Socialism if their civilization is to survive the coming storm of modernity."

totalist_savinkovism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Revolutionary Savinkovism)§!\n\nRevolutionary Savinkovism - Taking the syncretic nature of baseline Savinkovism to new heights, Revolutionary, or Left, Savinkovism is the final evolution of Boris Savinkov’s political odyssey. Combining views gathered from his time in both the Left and Right wings of radical Russian politics, Left Savinkovism is highly Nationalist, Militarist, and Totalitarian while pushing for total, yet open, Russification of the state like its predecessor, but supported by the Socialist economic policies of the Left SRs and the Chekists as opposed to Rightist Corporatism. Dyed Red and under a crimson banner born anew, Revolutionary Savinkovism seeks to bring utopia to the true children of Rus while annihilating any of those foolish enough to stand in the way."

commie_elfism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Marxism-Careyism)§!\n\nMarxism-Leninism-Careyism, also known as Marxism-Leninism-Careyist Thought or simply Elven Communism is the predominate leftist ideology of the various radical pro-labor groups in the North Pole. Calling for a Vanguard Party to led the 'Elfletariat' in the revolutionary struggle against the Theocratic-Monarchist-Feudal regime of Santa, Careyism differs from other forms of Marxism in that no others can led the world revolution but the Elven workers of Santa. Holding them as the most fair and developed of all working classes, Careyists hold distain against all other forms of Leftism, viewing them as up holders of a racist and unpure form of Revolutionary thought."

heat_miserism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Heat Miserism)§!\n\nBased on the simple premise of bringing about an age of heat, Heat Miserism is a new ideology to the workshop. While having little other to it than the aforementioned age of heat, Heat Miserism and it's adherents will do anything and everything to bring the world to it's knees, and restoring the true order of things. Despite sharing a name, and despite both of the Misers being brothers, Miserism as a whole shares but one similarity, a deep and burning hatred of the 50 degree range, agreeing that it must be eradicated at all costs."
fitzhughism_subtype:0 "Fitzhughism"
fitzhughism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Fitzhughism)§!\n\nFitzhughism, named after its chief and only real theorist George Fitzhugh, is a form of highly unorthodox pseudo-Socialism that revolves around the idea that race-blind chattel slavery, the rejection of wages and Capitalism, and staunch anti-Liberalism are the surest ways towards true Socialism and a free society. Largely forgotten about for decades as Fitzhugh drifted into obscurity, the ideology was recently revived and popularized by George W. Christians. Seeing Fitzhughism as such a pure strain of Socialism that it makes the Communards ‘look yellow’ in comparison, Christians seeks to combine Fitzhugh’s original ideas with his own positions of anti-Catholicism and uncompromising pragmatism to create a truly new and bizarre form of Leftist thought reviled by most of the Internationale but exceedingly popular with a growing group of fanatical followers and disillusioned radicals in America’s heartland."
social_futurism_subtype:0 "Social-Futurism"
social_futurism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Social-Futurism)§!\n\nPioneered by the major figures of the earlier Cubo-Futurist and Ego-Futurist movements of Russia, and influenced by the Italian Futurists like Marinetti that rose before them, Social Futurism represents the new wave of Leftist-inspired Futurist thought that fuses Socialist ideology with this rising cultural phenomena. Stepping away from the frequently-Right Wing thoughtform, Social Futurists such as Vladimir Mayakovsky, Natalia Goncharova, and Velimir Khlebnikov instead infuse both Utopian and Scientific Socialist ideas in order to blaze a pathway towards a new, Red-tinted vision for the future. In a Social Futurist system, the masses - frequently under the direction of a central government, technocratic council, or artistic vanguard - will work to erect a utopian society that endlessly marches forward to progress towards a modernized, urbanized Socialist future atop a speeding Red wave of ever-evolving theory, policy, art, and more."

militant_atheism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Militant Atheism)§!\n\nSeeing religion exactly how Marx once described, Militant Atheism seeks to fully eradicate the Opiate of the Masses in all forms, severing the final chain that shackles the Proletariat to the failures of the past. The specific form of Leftist ideology Militant Atheists adhere to can vary greatly, though it is usually tied to some variation of authoritarian and highly militarized forms of Socialism. However, what all of these groups share is a fierce devotion to freeing humanity from religion and spirituality in all forms as they replace it with civic dogma to the Party or the State."

technocracy_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Technocracy)§!\n\nTechnocracy is a form of government in which the decision-makers are selected on their basis in a given area of responsibility, particularly with regard to scientific or technical knowledge. Advocating for ideas such as ‘energy-accounting’ and the total acceleration of society and culture towards a new, efficient, and rationally-developed mindset supported by political systems free of bipartisan politics and factionalism, Technocracy is a vaguely Left-wing ideology, though technocratic ideas are common in different ideologies across the spectrum. Seeing Capitalism as wasteful and traditional Socialism as inefficient, Technocracy seeks to break the mold as it leads humanity towards an enlightened utopia."

maximato_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Maximato)§!\n\nThe term Maximato refers less to a structured ideology and more to the pseudo-socialist politics and changing thinking of the political chameleon Plutarco Elias Calles. Calles advocates the violent centralization of the state, with the powers in the hands of a single man 'El Jefe' around whom a strong cult of personality reigns and against whom no opposition is allowed. Under the Maximato, an extremist and very violent atheism is practiced, with religious people and institutions strongly persecuted and discriminated against, and with an economy completely under state control. In terms of foreign policy, the Maximist state is proudly isolationist, declaring its ability to sustain itself without any foreign aid."

Oftentimes influenced by outside sources, forces, or figures that bring these foreign ideas to these societies, Developing Socialists do not adhere to any one brand of Leftist rhetoric, and frequently incorporate greatly varied ideas in order to build the foundations of a Leftist or pseduo-Leftist ideology formfit to their specific realities, cultures, and traditions. Though Developing Socialism can merely be an intermediary step on the road to ‘true’ Socialism, it can also be the end-all and be-all goal for traditionalist groups merely seeking to make their own societies more prosperous and equal, or for outsiders to continue their ideological experiments."

Based on the assumption that the Third International was never fully committed to the colonial problem, Richytskyism attempts to create an anti-colonial network with a focus on 'Third World' struggles against colonialism. Borrowing much from Marxism and the experience of Leninist Russia, Richytskyism aims to build a state for the workers and peasants and the global liberation of the working masses from exploitative oppression."

In this new form of Leftist society form-fit for life on the Steppe, the Red Khan - the vaguely Socialist spiritual heir to the Great Khan Temüjin and new avatar of the God of Tengrism, rising to take the old place of Chinggis as embodiment of Tengri and mortal God of Mongolia - stands as the sole authority, loosely guiding the Mongolian people along the path of traditionalist Mongolian Nomadism and Pastoralism while keeping society at peace and in check with his roving horde of veteran horselords and bandits turned stewards of the ‘state’. This authoritative balancing force functions as the sole military and police force of this new Mongolia, and is paired with an Anarchist-inspired civilian government headed by a Crimson Khuraldai that oversees the creation, organization, and operation of the disparate nomadic clans, cooperatives, collectives, and communes that ever-expand and ever-shift across the resurgent Mongol Empire. Finishing the trinity of loose government over this anti-Statist web of mobile yurt-cities and temporary settlements is a spiritual administration, headed by the Bogdo Lama and the surviving clergy, preaching a new syncretic mixture of Buddhism, Tengrism, and traditional Mongol Shamanism in order to unite the Pan-Mongolic peoples and heal from the atheist purges of MAN. Under the Red Khan, a new Socialist form of the old Mongol Empire shall attempt to rekindle the glories of the past while fusing practices like Militant Paternalism and staunch Mongolian religious Traditionalism with ideas of pseudo-Anarchist Pastoralism, spiritual syncretism, Pan-Mongolic nationalism, and nomadic communalism in order to bring egalitarian anarcho-arcadian pastoral paradise guarded by the bow and steed to all true children of the Great Chinggis Khan."

Though the pathways to achieve and uphold these Three Pillars can change drastically based on the specific interpretation one comes to after digesting the late Sun Yat-sen’s works and ideas, all emulations of Tridemism seek to bring greater honor and glory to China, greater prosperity and freedom to the Chinese people, and a greater union between all aspects of Chinese society as the Three Pillars guide China to their modern and utopian destiny."

Abandoning the Anglophilic attitudes of his original thoughtform, this new wave of Lovecraftism emphasizes culture over racial differences, and seeks to create a universal cosmic identity for all of Humanity to share that incorporates and emphasizes the best aspects of all constituent identities. Taking this new cultural synthesis, this Leftist ideology combines the esoteric ideas and beliefs of the Lovecraftian Cosmicist mythos with Left populism, welfare economics, communalism, technocracy, and anti-democratic principles along with an unwavering commitment to ignoring compromise in order to achieve the perfect progressive reformation without revolution.

Furthermore, the economic determinism/materialist fatalism and total economic importance espoused by traditional Marxist and newer Syndicalist currents is entirely rejected, instead preaching a reform-oriented and pragmatic, humanistic understanding of Marxism and wider life philosophies, seeing this approach as the philosophy of praxis and an absolute historicism that transcends the traditional materialism and misguided idealism of normal Marxism. In opposition to mainline materialist Marxism, Gramsci preaches that a new cultural hegemony must be formed off the back of the Revolution and its ideas that truly represent the will and mindset of the global proletariat so that society can maintain order that is produced and reproduced by the dominant revolutionary class and the institutions of the societal superstructure they control."

As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies, using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a non-collectivist Anarchist utopia.

The central tenet of Georgist philosophy states that although people should value what they themselves produce, the ‘economic rent’ - or all natural resources and other common goods of an area - must be owned equally by all members within a society. Putting forth that the only tax should be on land value, for taxing the economic rent only leads to inefficiencies and exploitation, Georgism is primarily concerned with economics, but has since been tied to ideas ranging from Syndicalism and Progressivism to Democratic Socialism and Left Libertarianism to certain strains of Anarchism and even non-Socialist ideologies in more Rightist and Centrist circles.

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire.

Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob that - who hold that their crimes were an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement inline with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no moral basis and that such illegal acts were pursued due to one’s own personal desires and not some higher ideal. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies, using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a non-collectivist Anarchist utopia.

While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work.

Centered around the idea that cultural hegemony - a shared and dominant internationalist culture that replaces violence, prejudice, religion, ideology, ethnic tension, nationalism, and more - must be achieved in order to control the masses and the passive Revolution in an evolved emulation of the status quo enforced by former bourgeoise elitists, Gramsci's Machiavellian Socialism dictates that violence, economics, and other forms of unjust coercions can never create a Socialist society adored and supported by the broad masses and wider facets of society. Furthermore, the economic determinism/materialist fatalism and total economic importance espoused by traditional Marxist and newer Syndicalist currents is entirely rejected, instead preaching a reform-oriented and pragmatic, humanistic understanding of Marxism and wider life philosophies, seeing this approach as the philosophy of praxis and an absolute historicism that transcends the traditional materialism and misguided idealism of normal Marxism.

A mix of Authoritarianism and pure Socialist Democracy, Popular Communism seeks to safeguard the Revolution without resorting to infighting, excess violence, brutal repressions and reprisals, and other inhumane practices.

Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."

This ideology combines the essence of Cossack identity and heritage with the principles of socialism, creating a distinct socialist system of governance. Drawing inspiration from national-oriented communist movements such as National-Communism, the Red Cossack Dictatorship emphasizes the importance of recognizing and preserving national and cultural peculiarities within the framework of Marxist and communist principles. It rejects cosmopolitanism and globalization, advocating instead for the preservation and autonomy of a Cossack culture. While the Red Cossack Dictatorship shares some similarities with military dictatorships, it maintains a distinctive leftist orientation and a focus on achieving socialist objectives. It may exhibit less authoritarianism and militarism compared to other socialist regimes. Some variations of this ideology may strive to establish socialism and maintain power until their vision of a just society is achieved, while others may allow for elections once reactionary forces are subdued. The Red Cossack Dictatorship aims to uphold the rights and interests of the Cossack class while pursuing socialist ideals within a national context."

The central tenet of Georgist philosophy states that although people should value what they themselves produce, the ‘economic rent’ - or all natural resources and other common goods of an area - must be owned equally by all members within a society. Putting forth that the only tax should be on land value, for taxing the economic rent only leads to inefficiencies and exploitation, Georgism is primarily concerned with economics, but has since been tied to ideas ranging from Syndicalism and Progressivism to Democratic Socialism and Left Libertarianism to certain strains of Anarchism and even non-Socialist ideologies in more Rightist and Centrist circles.

Still poised at forging a united and cohesive ‘Belgian’ identity from the disparate French and Dutch halves that are the Walloons and Flemish, Reformed Belgicism seeks to divorce Degrelle’s failed ideas of violence and anti-democratic authoritarianism from ideas of Belgian Nationalism while providing for all Belgian citizens in one way or another. Not innately tied to a specific ideological current, Reformist Belgicism is primarily concerned with reducing the political autonomy of the constituent halves of its union while promoting national syncretism and bilingualism, though oftentimes each individual movement will heavily favor either French or Dutch for ease or out of personal bias. Reformist Beglcisits are frequently paired with ideas of Roman Catholic piety, Social Catholicism or non-Revolutionary Socialist Welfare, Belgian Unitarianism, and the cultivation of a uniquely Belgian culture and identity, but the idea of a Belgian nationality is not inherently tied to any one political group, with ideas of Belgian statehood and cultural cohesion stretching far across the ideological and political spectrums of the Low Countries, from the Reformed and Humanitarian Rexists of Hergé to the Humanist Capitalists of Buisseret and the Socialist Belgicists of Dehousse."

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of Leftist Roerichism, the dedication to Socialist Internationalism as professed by the Mahatma Lenin and his likeminded saintly bolsheviks who worked to free humanity free oppression. Left Roerichists see Lenin and other humanitarian martyrs like him as true saints and masters trying to achieve this Pax Cultura through their own means, and as such have taken the ideas of a variety of Bolshevik and wider Leftist thinkers to heart. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."

Finding its roots in the early 18th century after the Kingdom of Sardinia was ceded to the House of Savoy from Spain, the Sardism idea is also deeply tied to the Island’s form of monarchism and aristocratic pride, though republican forms do exist in some fringe circles.

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity. Despite their anti-Islamic slant, Pharaonists do not seek to ban Islam or other religions outright, instead pursuing Secularism as they work to build a society based on the former glories of Kemet and her proud people. Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

Embracing illegality, criminality, and the taboo for each individual as a means of undermining Capitalism and other forms of Statist oppression that so-called ‘law and order’ upholds, Illegalists seek to tear down the State and replace it with a tumultuous sea of chaos, crime, and hedonistic excess unbound by standardized moral standards or oppressive social norms. Illegalism is mainly split between two main schools of thought, being the Individualist Illegalists inspired by Clement Duval and Marius Jacob that - who hold that their crimes were an educational and organizational tool used to facilitate a broadened resistance movement inline with the theories of individual reclamation, personal redistribution, and the propaganda of the deed - and the Egoist Illegalists inspired by the writings of Max Stirner and the actions of the Bonnot Gang who together argued that their actions required no moral basis and that such illegal acts were pursued due to one’s own personal desires and not some higher ideal. As such, Illegalism is barely a united ideology, and leaves matters of economics and other trivial things to other thinkers, ideologies, and strains of Socialism in their societies to fill in the gaps they leave behind as they pave the road to pure liberty and a stateless society without hierarchies, using crimes like theft, swindling, robbery, counterfeiting, shoplifting, banditry, looting, laundering, racketeering, blackmail, and more in order to reappropriate Capitalist wealth through intervention in economic affairs, subvert authoritarian and oppressive social structures, and bring about true freedom in a non-collectivist Anarchist utopia.

In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society.

Calling for social safety nets and minimalist welfare systems, Progressive Conservatism seeks to improve society without radical or rapid changes to the established status quo and traditions, and is often tied to Catholic social teaching, Christian democracy, and even the papal literary work ‘Rerum novarum’ which calls for a form of Catholic conservative progressivism in order to safeguard the Christian working masses against the predation of Socialism.

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity.

Commonly favoring confederations and federalism over the idea of unitary systems and strong centralized governments, Regionalists look to places like the early United States, the Ottoman Empire, or modernized clannist structures as influences as they create a web of autonomous and semi-autonomous administrations within their national patchwork to create a modern nation state that fits the needs, traditions, histories, and unique differences of each constituent entity within the regionalist framework and their favored administrative entities or populations."

Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations.

This idea of Pan-Māori unity however is far from united itself, with varied kotahitanga sub-movements seeking to unite the tangata whenua - or ‘people of the land’ - using a myriad of possible unifying factors over the years; be it religion, democratic parliamentarianism, shared history and culture, an attempt at fostering modern Māori nationalism, or some other nebulous factor. Now, the Pan-Māori idea is largely championed by the elective monarchist Kīngitanga movement, started by the Waikato Tainui tribal waka confederation of Te Ika-a-Māui under first Māori King Pōtatau Te Wherowhero in the 1850s. They now stand as the main, but not only, group carrying the modern kotahitanga torch as they try to unite the various iwi of Aotearoa under a shared ‘Te Kīngi’ of the elected Te Wherowhero dynasty.

Though varied politically, first formed along Liberal and Progressive lines but with growing links to more radical groups in Leftist and Nationalist circles, the movement revolves around the idea that Egypt must look to its own ancient past in order to find national pride, peace, and prosperity. The movement crusades to undo the wrongs wrought against the ‘original’ Egyptian identity during the ‘Time of Barbarous Ignorance’, also called the Jahiliyyah and known in the West as the Middle Ages, when the last remnants of Ancient Egypt, or Kemet, were finally wiped away, yielding to the rising tide of Islam. Though the Pharaonic movement does not advocate a return to the ancient ways of the Old Kingdom in some sort of garish neo-pagan fashion in any way, it does extensively use the fables, art, monuments, language, iconography, and wider culture of old Kemet - including the Sphinx, the Great Pyramids of Giza, old hieroglyphics and monuments, and newer constructs built in a syncretic style fusing ancient styles with modern aesthetics - as points of national pride by the movement, galvanizing a solely-Egyptian national identity. Despite their anti-Islamic slant, Pharaonists do not seek to ban Islam or other religions outright, instead pursuing Secularism as they work to build a society based on the former glories of Kemet and her proud people. Attempting to mold Egyptian society in the image of a greater past, Pharaonism uses the revived glories of ‘Remtju ni Kemet’ in order to realize their egalitarian and nationalist liberation of Egypt, setting the people of the Nile and the Black Lands free from the stagnating forces of Islam, Western Colonialism, Conservatism, and post-Islamic Traditionalism once and for all."

As such, Minarchists tread this tightrope carefully as they use the night-watchman system to provide the masses a form of court system, military, and police force not originating from the State, but from the free masses themselves, creating a society free from tyranny that maintains the NAP and protects the public from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, enforcing property laws, and other encroachments on their inalienable freedoms, liberties, and rights."

Widespread across much of Africa and the wider Black Diaspora, it has been pioneered by figures such as Jean Price-Mars, W.E.B.

Neo-Confucianism is an attempt at creating a more rationalist and secular form of Confucianism, being highly critical of East Asian faiths such as Taoism and Buddhism, and especially opposed to the newer faiths of the encroaching West. Seeing metaphysics, or philosophies dealing with the fundamental nature of reality, as a catalyst for spiritual development, religious enlightenment, and even immortality, Neo-Confucianists use this philosophy as a guide for creating an ethical and rational ideology based on modernized traditionalism, familial values and Confucianist socio-economic ideas such as gaining wealth over the generations in a ‘posterity through offspring’ system as opposed to the instant gratification of Western Liberal Capitalism, the pursuit of social harmony, humanism, and secular rationalism supported by non-intrusive spiritualisms and religions, among other more varied and less-widely agreed up ideas on politics and socio-economics such as cultural exceptionalism, civic or ethnic nationalism, class cooperation, and mercantilist, corporatist, communalist, humanist, or even neo-feudalist financial systems.

Common in new nations like Togo, Congo, and Nigeria that have long been racked by regional rivalries dividend along ethnic and cultural lines forced to now live in an amalgamated nation, African Regionalism focuses on the development of a political or social system based on one or more ‘regions’ within a state, and/or on the national, normative, or economic interests of said specific region or other subnational entity. Similar to ideas of Nationalism but antithetical to their idea of total cohesion and equality across all territory, African Regionalism commonly fixates or prioritizes certain regions, ethnicities, cultural groups, religious sects, or peoples on a specific and personal basis unique to each nation and their reality, and is frequently seen in states and other recently-coalesced nations with a long history of factionalism, territorial rivalries, and ethno-cultural conflict, such as in Africa hence the name, but is also common in other regions such as across East Asia and the New World. Commonly favoring confederations and federalism over the idea of unitary systems and strong centralized governments, Regionalists look to places like the early United States, the Ottoman Empire, or modernized clannist structures as influences as they create a web of autonomous and semi-autonomous administrations within their national patchwork to create a modern nation state that fits the needs, traditions, histories, and unique differences of each constituent entity within the regionalist framework and their favored administrative entities or populations."

In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society.

Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of traditional Roerichism, the dedication to traditionalist values, the right to self-determination, and non-ideological pragmatism while using spiritual morality and guidance to guide humanity to virtue and prosperity. Tied to and influenced by other similar esoteric movements like the New Age movement, Russian Cosmism, Afro-Futurism, and other transhumanist cliques, Left Roerichism is a strange blend made by a strange man hell bent on uniting and preserving the spiritual and cultural beauty of mankind and wider nature, and will Socialist ideology to achieve such a utopia, unlocking the gateway to Shambhala itself."

The representatives of this particular ideology believe in uniting the people of their nation under the guise of a strong national identity combined with a democratic ideal fit for the environment they find themselves in. Inspired by the titular progenitor movements present both in Poland and Czech lands, National Democrats are highly popular in newly emerging states; ones created chiefly among the rubble left by the empires of old. Although religion is an important part of their platform and conservative way of thinking permeates, these aspects may be only surface deep and serve as a vehicle to coalesce the national consciousness into one body.

authdem_cossack_democracy_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Cossack Democracy)§!\n\nCossack Democracy represents a unique form of governance that diverges from conventional Western democracies, and which reflects a fusion of democratic principles and a staunch commitment to the Cossack identity, as well as serving the interests of the Cossack Class. It is deeply rooted in the Kuban People's Republic and the Almighty Don Host, and revolves around the concept of power being concentrated in the hands of the Cossacks. In this political ideology, democratic institutions exist as a means to empower and advance the Cossack class. The decision-making process primarily takes place through elected bodies known as \"Radas\" or \"Councils\", which are exclusively composed of Cossacks and serve as the primary avenues for shaping policies and safeguarding the interests of the Cossack community. Cossack Democracy maintains a distinct focus on the exclusion of non-Cossack social groups from the decision-making process. Membership in the Cossack community takes precedence over economic or social status, effectively limiting the involvement of other segments of society. This exclusivity solidifies the dominant position of the Cossacks within the political structure and ensures their continued influence. Unlike traditional democratic ideologies, Cossack Democracy does not aim for broad-based inclusivity. Instead, it emphasizes the preservation and promotion of Cossack interests within a democratic framework."
authdem_spiritualism_subtype:0 "Spiritualism"
authdem_spiritualism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Spiritualism)§!\n\nSpiritualism, and its related off-shoot Spiritism, describes a socio-religious mindset turned ideology that is centered around the idea that an individual’s awareness and self persists after death and may be contacted by the living. Central to this idea is the notion of the Afterlife or another form of spirit world - a non-static plane of existence parallel to the physical world that is ever-changing and evolving at the whims of the spirits that inhabit it. Though mainline Spiritualism, as popularized by Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, the Fox Sisters, Paschal Randolph, and Cora Scott in Europe and North America, does not put stock in spiritual transmigration or rebirth, their off-shoot Spiritism that is more popular in Asia, Brazil, and the wider Latin world places a direct emphasis on these ideas of spiritual reincarnation, as professed by Spiritist founder Hippolyte ‘Allan Kardec’ Rivail and his disciples across the world in groups like the Cao Dai and the Umbanda. Despite this minor difference, both movements and the wider connected spiritual movement share a stark rejection of occultism and esoteric knowledge, instead pushing for an exoteric platform where all can come together and learn the truth of the spirits. Furthermore, Spiritualists often support the notion of a kindhearted and understanding God or other all-powerful being tied to ideas theistic evolution, spiritual epigenesis, and theocratic syncretism while pushing for a social and artistic reformation based on their own unique views and aesthetics while constantly fighting against the leagues of skeptics that hound their organizations. Utilizing mediums, Mesmerism, hypnotism, trances, seances, ouija, illicit substances, and more to commune with the Afterlife in order to gain enlightenment and high evolution while creating political movements usually centered around some form of spiritually-uplifted republicanism, Spiritualists attempt to tap into the very heavens while performing their mortal works on this plane in order to achieve their idea of utopia."

Named after Andrew Jackson, this mutation of Jeffersonianism has been espoused by many great American leaders such as Van Buren and Polk. Calling for expanded property ownership, the primacy of family farming, political decentralization, and conservative egalitarianism, Jeffersonian Agrarianism is a syncretic movement that combines Right-wing values and morals with Left-wing attitudes towards aiding the working class without falling prey to venomous Socialism or Liberalism. Staunchly anti-Elitist, this American variant also largely supports the ideals of former President Andrew Jackson, as well as Jeffersonianism, Utilitarianism, Classical Liberalism, Liberal Conservatism, Populism, Laissez-Faire economics, and the American ideal of Manifest Destiny amid claims that it is also racially motivated and wildly Nationalist while accelerating Jeffersonian notions of a strong executive to Jacksonian ideas of a near-supreme one."

Not innately tied to a specific ideological current, though frequently based in reactionary thought, Belgicism is primarily concerned with reducing the autonomy of the constituent halves of its union while promoting syncretism and bilingualism, though oftentimes each individual Belgiscist movement will heavily favor either French or Dutch for ease or out of personal bias. Deeply rooted in organizations such as the Francophonic Parti Rexiste and the Dutch-speaking Verbond van Dietsche Nationaal-Solidaristen, or Verdinaso, Beglcisits are frequently paired with ideas of Roman Catholic Corporatism, Conservative Nationalism, Militarism, and strict Authoritarianism, but the idea of a Belgian nationality is not inherently reactionary, with ideas of Belgian statehood and cultural cohesion stretching far across the ideological and political spectrums of the Low Countries, though it still largely exists as a fixture of the ‘Belgian’ Far-Right."

In the case of places like Fiume, the Dual Cities were pushed to the brink, resorting to piracy in a bid to keep themselves afloat, both literally and financially. Due to its bellicose nature, Pirate Republicanism is usually incredibly strict and very loyalty-based, only promoting those of the highest merit with little regard to birth. Direct Democracy is used on board ships and within the army, but there are no elections to elect the Dual Governor or the city council in the case of Fiume, or the governments of other similar regimes. Pirate Republics are only usually willing to work with those they believe can be trusted or those that can help lessen the pirate plight. This strange ideology is uncompromising in the face of pursuing its unique goals and places heavy emphasis on cooperation and the wise management of funding, as well as within the idea of developing a "cult of personality" around the executive, being the Dual Governor, or Grand Admiral in Fiume’s case - the main progenitor of this weird ideology."

Roerichism itself teaches a fusion of Theosophy, Buddhism, Russian Orthodox Christianity, Vedic, Hinduism, Spiritism/Spiritualism, and other religions of the East and West, originally created for the Russian culture in mind and later adapted to be implemented on a more global scale. With this spiritual syncretism and wider belief in what others consider supernatural or taboo, Roerichists support cultural, artistic, and social reformation and revolution on a mass scale, seeking to progress humanity to become a new cosmic root race under a grand Pax Cultura - a shared and enlightened culture for all humanity called the Cult of the Light of the Fire. These ideas are supported with the immensely sacred religious traditions they support, along with a deep concern for environmentalism and the protection and sanctification of nature, the appreciation and pursuance of perfection in the high arts such as music and painting, and in the case of traditional Roerichism, the dedication to traditionalist values, the right to self-determination, and non-ideological pragmatism while using spiritual morality and guidance to guide humanity to virtue and prosperity.

First theorized by German socialist theorist Ferdinand Lassale with his idea of the Nachtwächterstaat - a system inspired by the watchman system of public-organized militias separate from the government that protected towns and cities starting in Europe’s medieval period - Minarchism treads the line between State and Statelessness, arguing that Anarcho-Capitalism and other forms of total Anarchism are impractical as they cannot enforce the non-aggression principle, while total State control strips liberty and freedom from all beneath its gaze. As such, Minarchists tread this tightrope carefully as they use the night-watchman system to provide the masses a form of court system, military, and police force not originating from the State, but from the free masses themselves, creating a society free from tyranny that maintains the NAP and protects the public from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, enforcing property laws, and other encroachments on their inalienable freedoms, liberties, and rights."

However, this LVT is not spread across the entirety of society like its Leftist counterparts advocate, instead only utilizing it in plots and regions where it would be beneficial to the masses and the economy, though how this is determined, who determines it (whether it be private companies, the public, or the State), and the extent of its use varies greatly based on the group and their ideological biases. Split between a more conservative strain that pushes for limited social spending financed by the concept of rent value capture that only captures a portion of the land rent while the rest is kept by the government for funding purposes, and the Geolibertarian position that demands that all excess rents should instead be gathered and distributed among the masses, Right Georgism is a varied and ever-evolving thoughtform that has begun to form the foundation of a number of budding movements across the non-Socialist spectrum."

While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work.

Originating in the 1500s, the ideology has evolved and spread over the years throughout the the wide lands that the English and their kin have settled, gathering traction in Republican and Monarchist movements across the lands of the former British Empire, but the ideology in all variations preaches the ‘truth’ that the Chosen Race shall replace the false Hebrews and the rest of the heretics and non-believers in order to create a true Abrahamic utopia in the image of God’s Paradise here on Earth. Furthermore, the ideology preaches that the British throne is the direct continuation of the Davidic throne of Israel and that the British Royal Family are the direct blood descendants of King David of Judah, that the Stone of Scone used in British coronations is the pillow stone of the bible that Jacob slept on and was later used in David’s coronation, that Britain and the United States are the inheritor’s of Jacob’s birthright through the Tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, and that most modern Israelites spread across the world like the Britons are not Jews.

Viewing this Nordic racial group as the bastion of Western Civilization and true Human progress that revitalized Europe after the fall of Rome and gave rise to the modern age of European excellence, this fringe movement of the Far-Right is deeply tied to ideas of ethno-eugenics, anti-Semitism, 19th century Aryanism, and Scientific Racism and the racial sciences considered pseudo-intellectualism by many of those that detract the Nordic truth, but the specific politics and economics behind the movement ranges greatly, with Corporatist Populism, Right-wing Capitalism, Christian Distributism, and even National Syndicalism being popular in some circles, depending on the particular Nordicist sect.

While most either espouse the superiority of the descendants of the Spanish Conquistadors or try to somehow integrate the native populations the Leopardos view the European 'Aryan' as the highest form of humanity. This has led the movement to support mass immigration of White Europeans to Colombia as a way to rejuvenate the nation and slowly replace the current inhabitants, annihilating the inferior Mestizo caste.

Once again influenced by Savinkovite groups, Yuri Shirinsky-Shikmatov believes that a top-down enforced identity would lead to nothing but disaster and while other ethnicities and nationalities have a place in the coming Pan-Eurasian project, the Russian nation is the only one capable of governing such lands and shall be considered the greatest group in the nation.

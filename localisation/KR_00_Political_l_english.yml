### Subtype Descriptions ###
totalist_subtype_desc:0 "The term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. Totalism is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarization, centralization, and totalitarian transformation of society."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."

natsynd_subtype:0 "National Syndicalism"
natsynd_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Syndicalism)§!\n\nOftentimes referred to as Charter Totalism or even just Totalism, National Syndicalism describes an ideology that seeks to centralize the usually decentralized Syndicalist system around a strong central executive or authoritative body while supported by Nationalist tendencies. Pioneered by the likes of Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois, and Benito Mussolini, among other signers of the Totalist Charter, this new form of authoritarian Syndicalism seeks to safeguard the Revolution through any means necessary without allowing the weak and disorganized nature of decentralized government becoming an obstacle to national progress.\n\nThe term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults.

sorelianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Sorelianism)§!\n\nComposed on the teachings and writings of French Revolutionary Georges Sorel, Sorelianism seeks the creation of a deeply centralized National Worker's State with the framework of Revolutionary Syndicalism. While seemingly highly contradictory, Sorelianism is one of the more popular forms of national syndicalism within post-Revolution Western Europe, making it's viability as a sustainable ideology quite good.\n\nThe term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology.

national_communism_subtype:0 "National Communism"

Widespread across much of Africa and the wider Black Diaspora, it has been pioneered by figures such as Marcus Garvey, Stanley Mathenge, Nnamdi Azikiwe, and many others, and is one of the fastest growing new ideologies on Earth.\n\nEncompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."

natpop_kimbanguism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Kimbanguism)§!\n\nNgunzism, often just called Kimbanguism, is as much a faith as it is an ideology. Inherently linked to the Prophet Kimbangu’s pacifistic and populist Protestant message and the belief that the Christian faith started in the Congo and that Kimbangu himself is the Holy Spirit, Ngunzism forms the foundations of Kimbangu’s spiritual eden. Linked with nationalist groups, it has come to fully embrace Congolese Nationalism and Exceptionalism along with Corporatist economics while becoming even more radically anti-Imperialist, though it has retained its pacifistic stance despite opposition.\n\nEncompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy.

ariosophy_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Ariosophy)§!\n\nMeaning ‘Wisdom of the Aryans,’ Ariosophy - also called Armanism - is the brainchild of Lanz von Liebenfels and his predecessor Guido von List which uplifts the Austrians and the rest of the so-called Aryan race as the pinnacle of humanity. Describing other races are ape-men and lowly beasts, only the Aryans are the true sons of the ancient god-beings that birthed us, and though careful adherence to von Liebenfels’ teachings, the Aryans can reattain their divine powers and status, or that is the hope. Deeply tied to Germanic paganism and romanticism while being unapologetically supremacist, seeing all other forms of humanity as subhuman wastrels, Ariosophy seeks to uplift the one, chosen race to utopia while leaving all others behind in the mud or beneath it.\n\nEncompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy.

volkism_subtype:0 "Völkism"
volkism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Völkism)§!\n\nVölkism, sometimes erroneously dubbed as Folkism or Valkism outside the Germanic Sphere, describes a loosely connected group of Germanic ultranationalist schools of thought that strive for racial purity, national unity, martial strength, and sometimes - but not always - devout piety. Though sometimes Atheistic and very rarely pagan, a large majority of Völkist groups are Nordicist or Neo-Marcionite in faith, and all are guardians of tradition and the ways of their old ancestors and older gods. Utilizing a range of Corporatist to near-anarchist economic theories depending on the specific band, this ideology is as varied and disorganized as it is enduring and infectious, with its rhetoric of Blood and Soil ringing true with the hearts and minds of many disillusioned Germanics.\n\nEncompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy.

natpop_paneuropeanism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Paneuropeanism)§!\n\nPaneuropeanism, in its broadest sense, describes any ideology pushing towards total European unification. From the traditionalist and aristocratic but liberal and progressive ideas of Kalergi to the hypernationalist, esoteric, and anti-modern rhetoric of Evola, this ideology comes in many variations and breeds. Above all, however, they are usually nationalist - either through the creation of a new Pan-European identity or through the uplifting of one or more specific ethnicities - and seek to unify Europe so as to protect the continent from outside influences while working towards the prosperity of all those deemed worthy within.\n\nEncompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy.

national_radicalism_subtype:0 "National Radicalism"
national_radicalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Radicalism)§!\n\nA byproduct of the younger generation of Endecja members becoming politically active, National Radicalism is the more fervent form of National Democracy, taking the Polish National Thought to its extremes. To the young radicals, a unified Polish nation is a Catholic nation and any notion of atheism or agnosticism professed by old Endecja is scoffed at. When it comes to a vision for a government system they are also more radical, advocating for highly hierarchical or even outright totalitarian forms, run by a lifelong senate, one leader or an enlightened council. National Radicals also don't try to hide their disdain for most ethnic minorities inside Poland's borders, although some dream of creating a Pan-Slavic hallowed empire. Radicals are also somehow even more divided on the matter of the economy than mainline Endecja, supporting everything from the free market, corporativism, right syndicalism, distributism and ending up on a neo-feudalist guild system. If there is one clear thing about National Radicals, it's certainly that they are even more controversial and less politically defined than their progenitor Dmowski.\n\nEncompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy.

### Subtype Descriptions ###
totalist_subtype_desc:0 "The term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. Totalism is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarization, centralization, and totalitarian transformation of society."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."

### Names ###
natsynd_subtype:0 "National Syndicalism"
natsynd_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Syndicalism)§!\n\nOftentimes referred to as Charter Totalism or even just Totalism, National Syndicalism describes an ideology that seeks to centralize the usually decentralized Syndicalist system around a strong central executive or authoritative body while supported by Nationalist tendencies. Pioneered by the likes of Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois, and Benito Mussolini, among other signers of the Totalist Charter, this new form of authoritarian Syndicalism seeks to safeguard the Revolution through any means necessary without allowing the weak and disorganized nature of decentralized government becoming an obstacle to national progress."
authcom_subtype:0 "Communism"
authcom_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Communism)§!\n\nThe term 'Communism' is usually used to designate one of the main alternatives to orthodox French and English Syndicalism. Based on the writings and thoughts of Marx, Engels and Lenin, the ideology promotes revolution as a means of seizing power led by a vanguard party operating on the principles of democratic centralism composed of professional revolutionaries, representing both workers and peasants, who would establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, a phase of Socialism serving as a transition from the Capitalist bourgeois society to the ideal classless and stateless society: the communist society. During this phase of Socialism the means of production would be transferred from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat. The tendencies within the Leninist current may differ, but all Communists are united in their struggle for a better world for the proletariat of the whole world."
sorelianism_subtype:0 "Sorelianism"
sorelianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Sorelianism)§!\n\nComposed on the teachings and writings of French Revolutionary Georges Sorel, Sorelianism seeks the creation of a deeply centralized National Worker's State with the framework of Revolutionary Syndicalism. While seemingly highly contradictory, Sorelianism is one of the more popular forms of national syndicalism within post-Revolution Western Europe, making it's viability as a sustainable ideology quite good."
national_communism_subtype:0 "National Communism"
national_communism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Communism)§!\n\nCombining aspects of Nationalism and Patriotism with Socialist and purely Communist practices, National Communists seek to progress towards a truly Communist society - as dictated by Marx and Engels - while supported by a fervent nationalist identity. Seizing the means of production for the Proletariat while bolstering a national identity for all in the nation to adhere to and find pride in, ‘NatComs’ hold that only through the elevation of their unique national identity can true Communism be achieved, wholly distinct from commonly held ideas of Internationalism and Pan-Leftist unity.

Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work.

Taking this new cultural synthesis, this Leftist ideology combines the esoteric ideas and beliefs of the Lovecraftian Cosmicist mythos with Left populism, welfare economics, communalism, technocracy, and anti-democratic principles along with an unwavering commitment to ignoring compromise in order to achieve the perfect progressive reformation without revolution.

These titans guide society as it crawls towards a new, efficient, and rationally-developed mindset supported by political systems free of bipartisan democratic politics and factionalism, stripping down and purifying democracy and society to be incorrupt, just, and efficient under God.

These Colonial Regimes typically lack any concrete ideology, and instead simply serve as the bureaucracy that manages the colony. In this sense, these Colonial Regimes serve to do nothing but keep the gears of colonialism and imperialism running and profits flowing to the homeland. However, these Colonial Regimes will not hesitate to put down opposition to ensure the survival of the Colony, yet vary in how they go about this task as well as in how they organize their specific administrations and how loyal they are to the homeland."

Ranging from bandit groups with a state to organized military startocracies to even military-backed republican governments or pure dictatorships, Warlordism has less to do with politics and more to do with a lack of clear borders and the ever-present and often chaotic nature of warfare. Warlordism is frequently a transitory state, and is usually just a stepping stone on the road to a more clearly defined political system, though some pure warlord states do exist."

Though not inherently, Right Pan-Africanism is frequently militaristic and sometimes even monarchist when not a national dictatorship, a junta, or a republic, and is commonly either corporatist, capitalist, or traditionalist in its economic goals with varying degrees of authoritarianism, though some democratic do exist.

Interest groups hold the majority of workers, whom get a sway in governance. Unique to Austropopulism, though, it places good special emphasis on the peasantry - the upholder of the nation itself.\n\nFiercely nationalistic, Austropopulists do not view anyone lesser or more worthy of equality - as the nation is to be, ideally, nonpartisan and unjudging of one's appearance or origin; rather of their affirmation to God and the quality of their character."

Fanatically loyal to pan-Germanism, the Brotherhood believes that Germany's role should be to lead Europe in this crusade, and so its goal is to turn the Baltics into a model province for the 'National Revival', from where the flame can be brought to Germany.

In these systems, political actors and bureaucrats act as patrons, brokers, and clients, exchanging favors and brokering deals with other influential groups, persons, or constituents in order to achieve political success.

As he sets himself up as a faux monarch in Africa, others around the world look to his image and copy his methods as they seek to build their own fiefdoms as well."

townerism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Townerism)§!\n\nTownerism, more generally called Amerindian Revivalism or Nativist Nationalism, is a unique and non-uniform group of ideologies pioneered by the likes of Elwood Towner, Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco, and Francisco May Pech, among other Nationalists within the diverse Native American population. Espousing Anti-White and Anti-Western sentiments, this Nationalist, Militarist, Corporatist, and highly Xenophobic ideology varies, either calling for syncretic unity between all Native American groups in order to bolster the decaying culture of the First Peoples from the corruptive and corrosive influence of the White Devils, or merely revivalism of one specific Amerindian or Mesoamerican identity. Populist by nature and concerned with ecological and spiritual matters while being anti-Clerical towards standard, Western, non-Indigenous faiths, this unique grouping of ideologies seeks to undo the damage the ‘White Man’ has wrought upon the Americas while either uniting or singularly uplifting their chosen Amerinidian ethnic group above all other lesser races and cultures."

Popularized particularly within Latin America and Iberia, as well as minorly in Italy and France, Right Syndicalism pursues a ‘purified’ and populist form of Syndicalism usually based around nationalist, ethnicity, or race, and is frequently militarist in its outlook."

national_basedism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Basedism)§!\n\nYou like Huey Lewis and the News? Their early work was a little too New Wave for my  taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello but I think Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip To Be Square,' a song so catchy that most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's a a personal statement about the band itself."

natpop_right_panafricanism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Right Pan-Africanism)§!\n\nRight Pan-Africanism, sometimes penned as Pan-Afrikanism, Panafrikanism, or Panafrianism, describes a diverse group of ideas and movements all centered around the idea of Pan-African unity. Oftentimes including the African Diaspora as well as just the African continent, this fiercely Nationalist and varyingly Populist ideology usually seeks to promote either total political and even cultural unity between African groups under an array of Leftist ideas, or just cooperation and comradery between ethnic groups each promoting their unique identities in their own ethnonationalist states. Though not inherently, Right Pan-Africanism is frequently militaristic and sometimes even monarchist when not a national dictatorship, a junta, or a republic, and is commonly either corporatist, capitalist, or traditionalist in its economic goals with varying degrees of authoritarianism, though some democratic do exist. Widespread across much of Africa and the wider Black Diaspora, it has been pioneered by figures such as Marcus Garvey, Stanley Mathenge, Nnamdi Azikiwe, and many others, and is one of the fastest growing new ideologies on Earth."

Inherently linked to the Prophet Kimbangu’s pacifistic and populist Protestant message and the belief that the Christian faith started in the Congo and that Kimbangu himself is the Holy Spirit, Ngunzism forms the foundations of Kimbangu’s spiritual eden. Linked with nationalist groups, it has come to fully embrace Congolese Nationalism and Exceptionalism along with Corporatist economics while becoming even more radically anti-Imperialist, though it has retained its pacifistic stance despite opposition."

ariosophy_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Ariosophy)§!\n\nMeaning ‘Wisdom of the Aryans,’ Ariosophy - also called Armanism - is the brainchild of Lanz von Liebenfels and his predecessor Guido von List which uplifts the Austrians and the rest of the so-called Aryan race as the pinnacle of humanity. Describing other races are ape-men and lowly beasts, only the Aryans are the true sons of the ancient god-beings that birthed us, and though careful adherence to von Liebenfels’ teachings, the Aryans can reattain their divine powers and status, or that is the hope. Deeply tied to Germanic paganism and romanticism while being unapologetically supremacist, seeing all other forms of humanity as subhuman wastrels, Ariosophy seeks to uplift the one, chosen race to utopia while leaving all others behind in the mud or beneath it."

Though sometimes Atheistic and very rarely pagan, a large majority of Völkist groups are Nordicist or Neo-Marcionite in faith, and all are guardians of tradition and the ways of their old ancestors and older gods. Utilizing a range of Corporatist to near-anarchist economic theories depending on the specific band, this ideology is as varied and disorganized as it is enduring and infectious, with its rhetoric of Blood and Soil ringing true with the hearts and minds of many disillusioned Germanics."

From the traditionalist and aristocratic but liberal and progressive ideas of Kalergi to the hypernationalist, esoteric, and anti-modern rhetoric of Evola, this ideology comes in many variations and breeds. Above all, however, they are usually nationalist - either through the creation of a new Pan-European identity or through the uplifting of one or more specific ethnicities - and seek to unify Europe so as to protect the continent from outside influences while working towards the prosperity of all those deemed worthy within."
national_radicalism_subtype:0 "National Radicalism"
national_radicalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Radicalism)§!\n\nA byproduct of the younger generation of Endecja members becoming politically active, National Radicalism is the more fervent form of National Democracy, taking the Polish National Thought to its extremes. To the young radicals, a unified Polish nation is a Catholic nation and any notion of atheism or agnosticism professed by old Endecja is scoffed at. When it comes to a vision for a government system they are also more radical, advocating for highly hierarchical or even outright totalitarian forms, run by a lifelong senate, one leader or an enlightened council. National Radicals also don't try to hide their disdain for most ethnic minorities inside Poland's borders, although some dream of creating a Pan-Slavic hallowed empire. Radicals are also somehow even more divided on the matter of the economy than mainline Endecja, supporting everything from corporativism, right syndicalism, distributism and ending up on a neo-feudalist guild system. If there is one clear thing about National Radicals, it's certainly that they are even more controversial and less politically defined than their progenitor Dmowski."

mathengeism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Mathengeism)§!\n\nThe ideology of Stanley Mathenge is hard to truly describe, for it is Pan-Afrikan and occultist like its predecessor of true Maumausim, but has evolved into so much more. Called a variety of things from Bantu Supremacism and Pan-Afrikan Kikuyu Chauvinism to Nationalist Maumauism or even simply ‘Mathengeism’, this creed espouses pure self-reliance, autarky, anti-Westernism and anti-Europeanism, Bantu exceptionalism, Kikuyu-Kenyan nationalism, vaguely National Syndicalist economics in a traditionalist tribal structure, and complete loyalty and subservience to the state and to Mathenge himself. Pushing to unite the lands of all true children of the Bantu - encompassing roughly 2/3rds of the African continent - and seeking to eradicate or enslave any soul not of Bantu blood, Mathengeism is as bloody as it is determined to see this dream to the end. Highly militarized and totalitarian in the extreme while supported by the traditional and occult practices of both the Kikuyu peoples and the ritualistic Mau-Mau, Mathengeism seeks to bath Africa in blood in order to usher in the first true and united Bantu empire."

First coming to prominence during the 'Mrs. Clause' Crisis of Santa 265's tenor as St. Nick, Toy Santaism was eventually thrown out of power after Santa 265 successfully stopped Toy Santa from delivering coal to all the naughty children of the world. Policy wise, Toy Santaism actually deveiates very little from Santaism proper, with one exception. Instead of having mercy and understanding that children can do a few naughty things but still be nice at heart, Toy Santaism views even one naughty act as deserving of coal, or worse. While the majority of the world will receive coal according to the adherents of Toy Santa, a few do still get toys, but these special few are quite literally walking Saints, and are more the expectation than the norm."

Created by Anastasy Vonsiatsky with the formation of the All-Russian National-Revolutionary Labour Worker-Peasant Party of Nationalists, the Natsionalisty provided a paramilitary backbone to the Kolchak regime in form of the so-called Black Vanguard. Sharing some elements with Kazem-Bek's group, such as fervent nationalism and monarchist tendencies, National Restorationists denounce any form Bolshevism or Socialism as the 'Great Soviet Demon' corrupting the souls of Russia.

Referring to the rich history of the Boers in Africa, from the Great Trek to the Boer Wars, this ideology often advocates a form of racial segregation and an emphasis on the Afrikaans language. This ideology is practiced by political parties with heterogeneous tendencies, ranging from the revolutionary left to the populist nationalist right, but also by more moderate parties, although the largest center of Boer Nationalism is undoubtedly the National Party represented mainly by James B.

Bonapartists are often populist, promoting meritocracy as the right form of government organization. This ideology, although in decline in the 20th century, is still claimed by several diverse French movements, most calling for the return of the Bonapartes to the throne.

Ranging from pseudo-Republican elected Tribal Chairmen to full hereditary Chiefdoms that function in a similar but less ostentatious way to European Monarchies, these governments are united in their reverence for the past traditions of their peoples, and in their dedication to provide non-Socialist paternal populism to their masses so that all within society may prosper. Their main differences lie in how they organize their economies, in how Modernist or Traditionalist their regimes are, and in the nature of the leader and how much power they hold."

It is a millenarian religious movement which proclaims a new reading of the Bible and calls for a restoration of Christian morality across all of Europe. In the Baltic German nation, it sees a history of religious warfare and stalwart faith, and so believes that their purpose is to champion this rebirth of Christianity in the face of Eastern and Syndicalist onslaught. Fanatically loyal to pan-Germanism, the Brotherhood believes that Germany's role should be to lead Europe in this crusade, and so its goal is to turn the Baltics into a model province for the 'National Revival', from where the flame can be brought to Germany. In practice, its regime is totalitarian, fanatically dedicated to Christian ideals, and heavily militaristic."

The Dontsov's doctrine is based on authoritarian integral nationalism and Social-Darwinism. According to him, the nation is in a permanent state of competition, and therefore a war for survival. It follows that war is an inevitable thing, and wars between nations are eternal. According to Dontsov, the Ukrainian nation, if it intends to enter the existing world order on an equal footing with the established ones, should have a hierarchy. At the head should be a leader or leader, then the elite or the order, under which the mass or the rabble. The party stands for the full independence of Ukraine. However, even if not all the principles of the doctrine are followed, Ukrainian nationalism is still very militant, also due to centuries of oppression of Ukrainians by various empires."

maurrassism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Maurrassisme)§!\n\n'Maurrassisme' also called Integral Natonalism, refers to the political, societal and intellectual theses developed by Charles Maurras, philosopher and master of thought of the Action Française. Charles Maurras contrasts the 'legal country' represented by the Republic and its elites, supported by the four 'confederate states': the Jews, the Protestants, the Freemasons, and the foreigners, the 'Anti-France', with the 'real country', which represents all the French people. Maurras' doctrine is based on the unity of society, a society that must function organically on the model of the Ancien Régime. The Action Française thus rejects the French Revolution and its consequences in order to establish a decentralized, traditional, localist and federal monarchy, with political powers concentrated in provincial assemblies with the King as the great national arbiter, while promoting Catholicism as the cement of national unity. On the intellectual level, Maurras emphasizes reason and Classicism and opposes Romanticism."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_SENGIER_DESC:0 "Few men are responsible for or control as much wealth in Africa as Edgar Sengier. Born in 1870, Sengier trained to become an engineer at the University of Leuven in his native Flanders before moving to the Congo to begin work at the Union Miniére in 1911, just as the UMHK was beginning to expand into new markets and different directions. Heading the UMHK’s expansion at this opportune time, Sengier first aided the Union Miniére by helping build up its domestic copper industry. By applying his technical expertise in the construction of new mines and refineries in Katanga, Sengier made a name for himself as a shrewd foreman and sound logician, planting the seeds for his rise through the UMHK’s hierarchy. In the years since, Sengier has taken the Union Miniére du Haut Katanga to new heights, particularly taking a keen interest in expanding the uranium mines of the Congo due to a tip from his colleague Sir Henry Tizard, and the massive mining monopoly now stands as the largest company in all of Congo. Sengier’s ambitions knows no bounds as he endeavors to make the UMHK, and by extension himself, the richest single entity in Africa."
POLITICS_MAD_MIKE_DESC:0 "An Irish boy far from his ancestral home, born in the distant city of Calcutta in 1919 - 6 years before the fall of the British Empire to fiery revolution - Thomas Michael Hoare is an odd sight to see in Katanga, and yet here he rules over a growing band of mercenaries like a modern warrior-king. \n\nThe son of a river pilot and military veteran, Hoare’s family fled Calcutta when he was a boy as the city burned in the death throes of British Imperialism, and fled to his father’s old home in South Africa. \n\nWhile in his new home, Hoare attended regular schooling in Pretoria before growing bored and impatient with the lack of action. To remedy this boredom and burning hatred built up since his family’s forced migration, Hoare took up an early tour with the South African Union Defense Force by lying about his age, where he received a baptism by fire while still just a teenager against Zulu rebels and border conflicts with the Germans. After becoming entranced by the beauty and glory of war at a young age and after witnessing his family be uprooted and run out of India by Socialist revolutionaries, Hoare has developed into a violent, ravenous, and deadly young soldier with an abhorrent disdain for Socialism and rebellion. Leading a group of other like-minded young officers, soldiers, bandits, and other vagabonds called Commando 5, or as Hoare calls them his ‘Wild Geese,’ Thomas Michael Hoare has begun to make a name for himself, and now the world shall watch as this ‘Mad’ Mike builds his own fiefdom in the heart of Africa."
POLITICS_TSHOMBE_KATANGA_DESC:0 "Moïse Kapend Tshombe would probably sell out his own mother if it meant it would complete his dream of a free Katanga, but luckily that may not be necessary, for it seems that Tshombe has achieved this dream himself. After seceding from the Kivu Clique and their bastardized attempt at a republic, Tshombe now reigns as the President of the State of Katanga - a newly independent state held up by a loose alliance of colonial investors from the UMHK, mercenary brigades, Mwami loyalists, and CONAKAT politicians and tribal leaders. Under its new President, Katanga is expected to be further exploited for the sweet allure of profit, for no man in Africa loves money like President Tshombe. Now, this Golden God of Katanga must dance a fine line between his web of alliances lest the wolves that circle his position so ravenously find their moment to strike."
POLITICS_MUNONGO_DESC:0 "Once Moïse Tshombe’s main ally in CONAKAT, Godefroid Munongo has surpassed his old friend to be the new leader of Katanga through dubious means. Tshombe’s true fate matters not now, for Munongo is the new President, and has great plans for his new domain. As a descendent of the Msiri - the original founder of Garanganze and the first of the Mwami - Munongo has begun to fashion himself as an alternative to the aging Mwami of Katanga, though he still bends the knee for appearances to ensure the Mwami’s loyalists still support him. Munongo plans to further the purification of Katanga and seeks to amplify the current campaign against the Kasaians while slowly distancing himself from the mercenaries and colonials in his employ. What is in store for the evermore chaotic Katanga is not sure, but with the young, inexperienced, and brash Munongo at the helm, many fear that Katanga is fated to be in turmoil forever."

### Focuses ###

UMN_the_union_minere:0 "The Union Minière"
UMN_the_union_minere_desc:0 "The Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, or as its more commonly called the Union Minière or UMHK, is a massive mining concern founded as a joint venture by Flandro-Wallonian and Anglo industrial, rail, and mining concerns already operating in the region in 1906. Since then, German interests have increasingly replaced the Anglos as the dominant partner to the Flandro-Wallonian operators, and as such, Germany has been able to benefit from the rich mineral wealth the UMHK extracts from the Earth. With the collapse of Mittelafrika and the Congo Vrijstaat, the UMHK has found itself adrift without the support of Europe for the first time since its foundation, and now they stand as the dominant force of power in Katanga. They must resist the swirling chaos that now engulfs them as it consumes the Congo, even as whispers of an old foe’s return circulate these jungles."

UMN_declare_independence_desc:0 "We have been cast adrift onto this sea of chaos that has replaced and consumed the once pristine and placid region of Congo. To consolidate our rule as we find our company tossed into the role of a provisional government, we must issue a formal declaration of independence from the Congo colony. Under the leadership of Chief Director Edgar Sengier and the Union Minière board of directors, a new sovereign corporate state shall rise in Katanga. For good health, good spirits, and high productivity!"

UMN_fate_of_the_north_desc:0 "To the North of our capitalist haven, the rest of the Congo is embroiled in fierce war as mercenaries and natives rise against the colonialist machine. We must decide here and now what our policy towards these collapse-states shall be. Whether we soldier on to take these resource-rich lands for ourselves or choose to enjoy our splendid isolation here in Katanga, the UMHK will find profit wherever we go."

UMN_unify_congo:0 "From Katanga to All of Congo"
UMN_unify_congo_desc:0 "The vast colonial apparatus that once ruled over this region we call Congo had long squandered the unimaginable material wealth hidden within the jungles and bedrock of this primordial Eden.

UMN_the_force_publique:0 "Join with the Force Publique"

Their oppressive but effective tactics are infamous throughout the colony, and despite their aging equipment and dwindling White officer corp, the native in their employ make up for it with their savagery and tenacity. We must align with this last sword and shield of colonial rule in Congo, lest we face the wolves alone."

UMN_support_the_government:0 "Recognize the Vrijstaat"
UMN_support_the_government_desc:0 "The Vrijstaat, or Free State, is the rightful Congolese government, and as such, our natural allies.

Their eyes are everywhere and their lackeys every patrol as the skies of Katanga and beyond turn black with the smoke of Capitalism’s dominance and progress.

To combat these lesser leeches and cease their drain upon our new state, Tshombe and Munongo had long ago concocted a plan to deal with these parasites. By using birth control, mutilations, and other scare tactics, the Kasaians shall be prevented from breeding, and as their numbers dwindle due to being overworked or due to our more aggressive policies, we shall ensure that their numbers do not replenish, for Katanga must be pure."

Luckily for us, the Congo and wider Central Africa has a long history of cooperation with mercenaries, and it just so happens that one such group of hired guns currently resides in our borders. The leader of ‘5 Commando,’ a foreign merc unit mainly composed of Anglo, French, and Flandro-Wallonian soldiers, is none other than the infamous ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare, who has carved a name for himself in blood and lead despite his young age.

Though these mercs are frequently drunk, high, or otherwise indisposed with either a lady of the night or some other money-fueled vice, their military expertise cannot be denied. This rough band of outlaws now serves as the main backbone of Katanga’s military, placing obscene amounts of control into the hands of the young Mike Hoare, and guarding our newly-won independence behind a wall of veteran killers whose loyalty is only ensured so long as they are paid."

Now, our honored President looks to the future, seeking to fully build up Katanga as the first true example of a ‘neo-colony’ by using the greed of the UMHK and the remnant colonials to further drive new capital and higher profits into Katanga, and into his own coffers, like never before.

Hoare must consolidate his grip over the nation and ready his men for the rigors ahead, for there is no more room for errors or debauchery. Under Mad Mike, Katanga shall be transformed into a mercenary's paradise - a true merc army with a state where everything is for the military, and the military is all for Hoare.

No matter your background or motive, all enemies look the same when a target is painted on their backs, and Mad Mike seeks to put this idea into full practice. All enemies of the state, known or potential, shall be hunted down, shot to shreds, or left to rot wounded in the hot sun as the forces of Commando 5 stalk Katanga for these sources of malcontent.

New processing centers and refinery plants shall be opened, their mines dug deeper, the infrastructure they use to connect their manufactorums shall be expanded, and so much more.

Controlling mines, refineries, factories, processing and shipping centers, their own rail infrastructure, and so much more, this monopoly of monopolies rivals the East India Company in its influence and power.

This company-turned-state must now establish itself in this rising tide of chaos and destruction, for the wolves circle it at every moment. To the North, mercenaries and native Askari have risen up to fight for their right of sovereignty, and within our own borders, whispers have spread of the Mwami’s return.

unionminere.5.a:0 "Together, for the good of the colony."
unionminere.5.b:0 "What was the point of this revolt then?! Deny them at once!"

unionminere.6.t:0 "A New Wave of Worker Unrest"
unionminere.6.d:0 "As the atmosphere of instability continues to grow within Katanga due to the violent and chaotic civil war, tensions within our struggling corporate state have risen near the breaking point. Miners and refinery workers across the plots and properties held by the UMHK have risen up in strike and protest, demanding better pay, safer working conditions, and shorter shifts along with other minor social welfare, for they have realized that they are the lifeblood of our company and our power. Worse still, due to our recently ‘earned’ independence, our workforce has been greatly limited, increasing the damage these rapidly spreading strikes have done to our economy and political influence. Without the money flowing and the gears of industry spinning, greased with the promise of profit and opportunity, our hold over Katanga will quickly crumble. We are a literal corporate state, and without a functioning and profitable corporation, our regime is not only doomed to fail but is virtually non-existent. These riots and strikes will need to be dealt with soon lest we desire for our feeble hold over this expanse to collapse, especially with the rumors of old foes regaining their strength in the dense jungles that surround and isolate us."
unionminere.6.a:0 "We will watch these strikes like hawks as we devise a plan forward."

unionminere.7.t:0 "A Possible Response to the Riots"
unionminere.7.d:0 "The various disconnected strikes, riots, and protests across Katanga have coalesced into a cohesive general strike, grinding the apparatus of the state to a complete standstill. With this crisis not having reached such a critical stage, many within the UMHK’s administration had called for drastic and harsh action to be taken to deal with the riots. These scared tycoons and captains of industry seek to pay off as many mercenaries as possible to function as emergency strike breakers while using refugees from the civil war as underpaid strike scabs. This sweeping plan would hopefully crush the spirits of these protestors as we move to consolidate our rule. \n\nHowever, many on the Board of Directors feel that this plan is far too drastic, likely to cause more problems than it would solve and only further angering the native Africans. These more level-headed administrators believe that only through negotiation with these strikers can there be any hope of peace, and Edgar Sengier has expressed his sympathy with this more moderate group behind closed doors. Whatever our Board’s final decision is, we must make it delicately, for Katanga inches closer to collapse by the day."
unionminere.7.a:0 "Heed Sengier’s warnings and work towards a peaceful solution."
unionminere.7.b:0 "Send in the scabs and mercs, it's strikebreaking time!"

unionminere.8.t:0 "Old Foes Reemerge"
unionminere.8.d:0 "With our decision to crack down harshly on the African workers striking against our regime, old foes have begun to rise from the primordial expanses of Katanga and beyond. From within the jungles and disconnected villages that remain untouched by our monopoly has once again risen the Mwami, heir to the Yeke Kingdom and ‘rightful’ ruler of Katanga. Patriarch of the Bayeke, or Garanganze, people and noble descendent of the Msiri, Mwami Kitanika and his loyal forces wage a guerilla war against our regime as they did against Ryckmans before us. Though his forces are dwindling due to his failed war against the Vrijstaat, he has still proven to be a thorn in our side, and some believe he is to blame for the recent rise in protests and strikes. Though this claim is dubious, with the protest more likely forming as a response to both our new rule in the wake of the civil war and our abhorrent managerial practices, this has not stopped the Mwami from becoming a scapegoat for our issues. With our situation growing more dire by the minute and with our resources already stretched so thin, our regime must make a choice. Should we waste precious weapons, supplies, and manpower, all resources we have little to spare, to deal with this minor tribalist threat to show the nation that something is being done to deal with the unrest, or shall we simply let this mad king rave as we deal with the larger issues at hand."
unionminere.8.a:0 "Break out the rifles, boys! It’s time to hunt some guerillas."
unionminere.8.b:0 "The last ditch efforts of a failed king are trivial. Let us return to our brandy and cigars."

unionminere.9.t:0 "The Mwami Plays His Hand Once More"
unionminere.9.d:0 "We have been foolish, too busy pursuing profit and dealing with the strikers, too long ignoring the rising tribalist threat, and now it may be too late to save our precious capitalist experiment. Even now, the forces of Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila and his brother Munongo march against us, and across Katanga more and more of our outlying mines and outposts go dark, failing to hail back to us on any frequency. These centers of our influence have slipped away without so much as a word of notice, and with each that falls, our hold over Katanga grows ever weaker. \n\nIn a final showdown outside the UMHK’s main compound in Elisabethville, the soul of Katanga is on the line as a large force of Mwami loyalists, all fervent supporters of the House of Msiri."
unionminere.9.a:0 "All that is needed is a bit of lead paid in gold; send in the mercs."
unionminere.9.b:0 "The Mwami, heir of the great Msiri and father of the Bayeke people, seizes power."

unionminere.10.t:0 "The Rebirth of the Yeke Kingdom"
unionminere.10.d:0 "The impossible has been completed - the colonialist dogs that have long infected the Congo have been cast out - and now the Bayeke people of Katanga breathe free air once again for the first time in decades. Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila and his brother, heirs to Msiri and champions of the people of Garanganze, are the liberators of Katanga, and now shall oversee the recreation of their ancestral kingdom. Pushing for a return to tradition, expanding resource extraction, consolidation of power under the Mwami’s kingdom, and slight reforms to model this resurgent monarchy after the enlightened Chrstian monarchies of Europe, the Mwami and his loyal forces shall finally free Katanga from the vices of colonialism and drag these primordial lands into the future, without losing sight of their tradition and tribalist roots."
unionminere.10.a:0 "The Yeke Kingdom rises once more atop the ashes of the UMHK."

unionminere.11.t:0 "Our Greatest Diplomatic Asset"
unionminere.11.d:0 "Of all the resource extraction sites, miners, and refineries within the Congo under the control of the UMHK, none is more important than Shinkolobwe. Also known as Kasolo or Chinkolobew, this massive mine at the heart of the Kambove mining region in Katanga is one of the largest single deposits of uranium on Earth, providing untold amounts of uranium and radium for us to extract and sell. With recent scientific advances, the potential of such a material is quickly being realized, and every great power on the planet is chomping at the bit for access to any known deposits of the stuff. \n\nThis lucrative nature could prove to be our greatest bargaining chip, as every nation with a hand in international diplomacy seeks to harness the power of this ore for themselves, yet most lack the necessary access to uranium and other elements like it to do it. With this in mind, we shall use our stores of uranium as leverage as we seek to find new allies to protect our newly independent capitalist haven. The most beneficial candidates for us to reach out to are of course Germany and the Entente - both the current and former colonial overlords of Africa. Whoever we reach out to shall be offered the necessary materials to unlock and harness the secrets of the atom, and all they need to do in return is supply our troops and keep our borders safe."
unionminere.11.a:0 "Reach out to the Kaiserreich, for they are the true and proven hegemon."
unionminere.11.b:0 "Though in exile, the Entente has proven their righteousness. Reach out to Ottawa."

unionminere.12.t:0 "Nuclear-Fueled Overtures From Katanga"
unionminere.12.d:0 "We have received a curious yet enticing proposal from the far-off land of Katanga, nestled in the southern reaches of the Congo. From this primordial eden, the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga has petitioned our regime with a most unexpected request. These capitalists have unmitigated access and ownership over Shinkolobwe, one of the world’s largest uranium mines. They have offered full access to their stores of this precious fissile material under the condition that we admit them into our alliance and offer them our protection. While doing so would further entangle us within African affairs, it would also align us with one of the richest and largest companies in Africa - and the only one both functioning as an independent state and with such easy access to one of the most sought-after materials on the planet. We must decide how to go about this situation, for this deal could change the face of history as we know it."
unionminere.12.a:0 "Accept the ore, for Germany shall harness its power for Gott und Kaiser."
unionminere.12.b:0 "Perhaps, on second thought, we should pursue other avenues to unlock the secrets of the atom."

unionminere.14.t:0 "Nuclear-Fueled Overtures from Katanga"
unionminere.14.d:0 "We have received a curious yet enticing proposal from the far-off land of Katanga, nestled in the southern reaches of the Congo.

unionminere.14.b:0 "On second thought, we should pursue other avenues to unlock the secrets of the atom."

## Mwami Events 
mwami.1.t:0 "The Fallout of the Congo Crisis"
mwami.1.d:0 "After carefully planned outmaneuvering and hard-fought victories, we have managed to come out of the Congo Crisis not only still standing, but also as the sole victors. The vast expanse of the Congo, from the thundering river that gives these lands their name to the great rainforests that smother the interior, is now under our control, at least nominally, for the bulk of our enemies have surrendered, and those that have not have instead been forced into hiding. However, the extent of our ancestors’ kingdom founded by the Msiri did not even encompass all of Katanga at its zenith. With this in mind, we have resolved to take all of Katanga as our prize, and have begun the process of releasing the rest of this war-torn quagmire so that they may deal with the mess they caused themselves. However, we must decide how to leave our former enemies, for their national future is at the mercy of our mighty armies. \n\nWe could either simply restore the Yeke Kingdom of old in Katanga and secede fully from the rest of the Congo, leaving the Northerners to figure out their own way in their newly established republic. Alternatively, we could not only restore the legacy of the great Msiri, but we could also entirely shatter the budding sense of Congolese nationalism by balkanizing the Congo completely. This would leave the once mighty Vrijstaat a shadow of its former self as the Congo is reduced to a small number of independent states. The choice, as always in matters of this level of importance, lies with our king, the Mwami."
mwami.1.a:0 "Restore the Yeke Kingdom! Leave the rest of the Congo be."
mwami.1.b:0 "Break up the Congo entirely and leave them to their own devices!"

## Katanta Events 

katanga.1.t:0 "The Fallout of Tshombe’s Gamble"
katanga.1.d:0 "After weeks and months of bloody civil war, President Moïse Tshombe has been able to defeat the ANC using his mercenary allies and colonial backing from the UMHK. With this hard-earned victory, Tshombe now stands as the sole figure of power in the Congo, at least for a moment, and now has free reign to carve up his prize as he sees fit. \n\nBefore him lay a few possible options for how to deal with the vast swathe of land he has just come intro control of. Tshombe could simply leave the rest of the Congo to their own devices, breaking Katanga off from the larger whole and leaving the fools in Kinshasa to fend for themselves as Tshombe reaps the profits and rewards of his hard work, saving him the headache of ruling over all of Congo. Alternatively, Tshombe could reinstate the Congolese Republic, declaring himself as President of all Congo while likely still heavily favoring his home region. In direct opposition to these ideas, Tshombe could also instead move to balkanzie the Congo entirely, shattering the colonially-forged makeshift borders destroying the idea of a unified Congo completely. If he were to take this more drastic solution, Tshombe could then either decide to merely leave the newly created states to their own devices, or instead corral them under his influence as satellite governments. In the end, the choice is up to the President, and the rest of the Congo waits with bated breath on his decision."
katanga.1.a:0 "Restore the Congolese Republic, with Tshombe at its head."
katanga.1.b:0 "Break up the Congo entirely and leave them to their own devices!"
katanga.1.c:0 "Break up the Congo and put it under our supervision!"
katanga.1.e:0 "Leave the Congo as is and have Katanga secede under Tshombe."

katanga.2.t:0 "Tshombe's Second in Command"
katanga.2.d:0 "With his ascension to the position of ‘President’ over the State of Katanga, Moïse Tshombe now must decide on who shall be his loyal Vice-President. Though this position is largely ceremonial, since most political power shall truly reside in Tshombe’s hands, it is still a required position to maintain legitimacy in the eyes of the people and the wider world while also helping to share the burden of ruling over this wild frontier. \n\nThe main candidates Tshombe has in mind are his main political ally in CONAKAT - Godefroid Munongo, the leader of Commando 5 and the head of Katanga’s mercenary military - ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare, and the current chairman of the UMHK - Edgar Sengier. Each of these candidates are vital to the overall survival of Katanga, but only one can be Vice-President. Who shall Tshombe choose?"
katanga.2.a:0 "Go with Godefroid Munongo, Tshombe’s right-hand man in CONAKAT."
katanga.2.b:0 "’Mad’ Mike Hoare is the man for Katanga!"
katanga.2.c:0 "Sengier has deep pockets, and deeper connections."
katanga.2.e:0 "Tshombe is already a capable leader."

katanga.3.t:0 "Hoare's Influence Grows"
katanga.3.d:0 "With his nomination from President Moïse Tshombe, Mike Hoare has risen to be the Vice-President of Katanga. With this ascension, Hoare and his men within 5 Commando, also known as the Wild Geese in reference to the 17th century Irish rebels who fought against the Stuarts, have risen to higher levels within the upper echelons of Katanga’s hierarchy, and many within CONAKAT have begun to worry about Mad Mike’s rising influence. President Tshombe has done much to assuage the concerns of his comrades, ensuring them that Mad Mike and his forces are only ensuring that the money continues to flow, denying any accusations that the young merc wants any power for himself. Despite this attempt at soothsaying from the President, many still are wary of the young merc."
katanga.3.a:0 "Nothing to be alarmed about."

katanga.4.t:0 "The UMHK's Influence Grows"
katanga.4.d:0 "With his nomination from President Moïse Tshombe, Edgar Sengier has risen to be the Vice-President of Katanga. With this ascension, Sengier and his associates within the Union Minère du Haut-Katanga, both Katanga’s and Congo’s largest company, have risen to higher levels within the upper echelons of Katanga’s hierarchy, and many within CONAKAT have begun to worry about Sengier’s rising influence. President Tshombe has done much to assuage the concerns of his comrades, ensuring them that the UMHK are only ensuring that the money continues to flow, denying any accusations that the colonials seek power for themselves once more. Despite this attempt at soothsaying from the President, many still are wary of Sengier and his ambitions."
katanga.4.a:0 "Nothing to be alarmed about."

katanga.5.t:0 "Tshombe Takes Off"
katanga.5.d:0 "President Moïse Tshombe has always been a man of leisure and fine tastes. Loving to travel the world in pursuit of greater sights and higher pleasures, it is no surprise to any in the nation that the President is once again departing from Lubumbashi, taking his private plane to God knows where to once again wet his beak with the luxuries of life. With his departure, the leadership of Katanga has been temporarily left to his closest allies like Munongo, Hoare, and Sengier, but all expect Tshombe’s return in a few days - once he’s had his fill of fine wine, finer women, and more gambling and partying than one man should partake in."
katanga.5.a:0 "Safe travels, Mr President!."

katanga.6.t:0 "A Problem with the President's Plane"
katanga.6.d:0 "While soaring high above the clouds in his personal Junkers 52/3m airliner, requisitioned from the Sabena company through his colonial ties, President Tshombe’s nap among the clouds was distrubed by a bit of rough turbulence. Hearing the pilot from the cockpit, it seems the plane collided with a flock of wild African geese, whose heavy frames have collided with the left engine, causing it to fail and causing the plane to slowly drop altitude as it travels thousands of feet above the Atlantic. With time of the essence, the flight crew have begun emergency measures, and now it is up to fate and the crew whether or not they can land this bird and bring our President home safely."
katanga.6.a:0 "Just a bit of avian-caused turbulence, nothing out of the ordinary."
katanga.6.b:0 "We’ve lost contact with Tshombe's plane, and Katanga’s national father is now missing!"

katanga.7.t:0 "Munongo Takes Over for the Late President"
katanga.7.d:0 "With President Moïse Tshombe now missing and presumed dead, a replacement has quickly been named to maintain stability in our chaotic little state. To make the transition as simple and quick as possible, Tshombe’s Vice President Godefroid Munongo has been sworn in as acting President until Tshombe, or his body, is found. Under Munongo, Katanga is expected to take a darker turn as the new President consolidates his position. The chief architect behind Tshombe’s reprisals against the Kasaian peoples like the Baluba, Munongo is expected to increase the regime’s attacks and harsh policies against this troublesome minority. A relative and self-proclaimed heir to the Mwami’s royal line, Munonogo is also expected to massively increase Katanga’s emphasis on the culture of the old Yeke Kingdom while also moving more closely to the Mwami as he distances himself from Hoare and Sengier."
katanga.7.a:0 "More of the same, it seems."

katanga.8.t:0 "Hoare Takes Over for the Late President"
katanga.8.d:0 "With President Moïse Tshombe now missing and presumed dead, a replacement has quickly been named to maintain stability in our chaotic little state. To make the transition as simple and quick as possible, Tshombe’s Vice President Mike Hoare has been sworn in as acting President until Tshombe, or his body, is found. Though he shall tacitly follow the legacy of Tshombe, many expect this facade of respect to drop quickly after Tshombe’s body is still left to be unfound after a few weeks with Hoare as President."
katanga.8.a:0 "This seems familiar."

katanga.9.t:0 "Sengier Takes Over for the Late President"
katanga.9.d:0 "With President Moïse Tshombe now missing and presumed dead, a replacement has quickly been named to maintain stability in our chaotic little state. To make the transition as simple and quick as possible, Tshombe’s Vice President Edgar Sengier has been sworn in as acting President until Tshombe, or his body, is found. Though he shall tacitly follow the legacy of Tshombe, many expect this facade of respect to drop quickly after Tshombe’s body is still left to be unfound after a few weeks with Sengier as President."
katanga.9.a:0 "Really, this again?"

katanga.10.t:0 "Hoare Seizes the Apparatus of State"
katanga.10.d:0 "With his ascension to acting President, ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare and the men of 5 Commando have worked diligently to consolidate their grip over Katanga. With their agents implanted within every major level of the Katanga hierarchy, Hoare has begun to shed the thin veneer of subservience he once had to Tshombe’s legacy, and now had fully broken off to fulfill his own agenda. ‘Mad’ Mike is expected to further militarize Katanga like never before as he and his Wild Geese move to fully transform the Congo into a wild and free merc state. Under Hoare’s regime, adventure, profit, and the ecstasy of combat shall become paramount pillars of the State of Katanga while Tshombe’s influence is washed away for good. Though the UMHK shall still maintain its level of wealth and prominence within Hoare’s new regime, the other old allies of Tshombe like Munongo and the Mwami loyalists have been ousted from the government for good. Now, the world watches as yet another powergrab takes place in Africa’s darkest heart, throwing Katanga and the wider region into chaos once more."
katanga.10.a:0 "Mad Mike's Control grows evermore."

katanga.11.t:0 "The UMHK Seizes the Apparatus of State once More"
katanga.11.d:0 "With his ascension to acting President, Edgar Sengier and the haughty colonials of the UMHK have worked diligently to consolidate their grip over Katanga. With their agents implanted within every major level of the Katanga hierarchy, Sengier has begun to shed the thin veneer of subservience he once had to Tshombe’s legacy, and now had fully broken off to fulfill his own agenda. The UMHK is expected to further industrialize Katanga like never before as he and his business partners move to fully transform the Congo into the most profitable swathe of colonial frontier in the world. Under Sengier’s regime, rampant capitalism and the unending march towards ever-higher profits shall become paramount pillars of the State of Katanga while Tshombe’s influence is washed away for good. Though the mercs of 5 Commando shall still maintain their level of prominence within our military under Sengier’s new regime, the other old allies of Tshombe like Munongo and the Mwami loyalists have been ousted from the government for good. Now, the world watches as yet another powergrab takes place in Africa’s darkest heart, throwing Katanga and the wider region into chaos once more."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_SENGIER_DESC:0 "Few men are responsible for or control as much wealth in Africa as Edgar Sengier. Born in 1870, Sengier trained to become an engineer at the University of Leuven in his native Flanders before moving to the Congo to begin work at the Union Miniére in 1911, just as the UMHK was beginning to expand into new markets and different directions. Heading the UMHK’s expansion at this opportune time, Sengier first aided the Union Miniére by helping build up its domestic copper industry. By applying his technical expertise in the construction of new mines and refineries in Katanga, Sengier made a name for himself as a shrewd foreman and sound logician, planting the seeds for his rise through the UMHK’s hierarchy. In the years since, Sengier has taken the Union Miniére du Haut Katanga to new heights, particularly taking a keen interest in expanding the uranium mines of the Congo due to a tip from his colleague Sir Henry Tizard, and the massive mining monopoly now stands as the largest company in all of Congo. Sengier’s ambitions knows no bounds as he endeavors to make the UMHK, and by extension himself, the richest single entity in Africa."
POLITICS_MAD_MIKE_DESC:0 "An Irish boy far from his ancestral home, born in the distant city of Calcutta in 1919 - 6 years before the fall of the British Empire to fiery revolution - Thomas Michael Hoare is an odd sight to see in Katanga, and yet here he rules over a growing band of mercenaries like a modern warrior-king. \n\nThe son of a river pilot and military veteran, Hoare’s family fled Calcutta when he was a boy as the city burned in the death throes of British Imperialism, and fled to his father’s old home in South Africa. \n\nWhile in his new home, Hoare attended regular schooling in Pretoria before growing bored and impatient with the lack of action. To remedy this boredom and burning hatred built up since his family’s forced migration, Hoare took up an early tour with the South African Union Defense Force by lying about his age, where he received a baptism by fire while still just a teenager against Zulu rebels and border conflicts with the Germans. After becoming entranced by the beauty and glory of war at a young age and after witnessing his family be uprooted and run out of India by Socialist revolutionaries, Hoare has developed into a violent, ravenous, and deadly young soldier with an abhorrent disdain for Socialism and rebellion. Leading a group of other like-minded young officers, soldiers, bandits, and other vagabonds called Commando 5, or as Hoare calls them his ‘Wild Geese,’ Thomas Michael Hoare has begun to make a name for himself, and now the world shall watch as this ‘Mad’ Mike builds his own fiefdom in the heart of Africa."
POLITICS_TSHOMBE_KATANGA_DESC:0 "Moïse Kapend Tshombe would probably sell out his own mother if it meant it would complete his dream of a free Katanga, but luckily that may not be necessary, for it seems that Tshombe has achieved this dream himself. After seceding from the Kivu Clique and their bastardized attempt at a republic, Tshombe now reigns as the President of the State of Katanga - a newly independent state held up by a loose alliance of colonial investors from the UMHK, mercenary brigades, Mwami loyalists, and CONAKAT politicians and tribal leaders. Under its new President, Katanga is expected to be further exploited for the sweet allure of profit, for no man in Africa loves money like President Tshombe. Now, this Golden God of Katanga must dance a fine line between his web of alliances lest the wolves that circle his position so ravenously find their moment to strike."
POLITICS_MUNONGO_DESC:0 "Once Moïse Tshombe’s main ally in CONAKAT, Godefroid Munongo has surpassed his old friend to be the new leader of Katanga through dubious means. Tshombe’s true fate matters not now, for Munongo is the new President, and has great plans for his new domain. As a descendent of the Msiri - the original founder of Garanganze and the first of the Mwami - Munongo has begun to fashion himself as an alternative to the aging Mwami of Katanga, though he still bends the knee for appearances to ensure the Mwami’s loyalists still support him. Munongo plans to further the purification of Katanga and seeks to amplify the current campaign against the Kasaians while slowly distancing himself from the mercenaries and colonials in his employ. What is in store for the evermore chaotic Katanga is not sure, but with the young, inexperienced, and brash Munongo at the helm, many fear that Katanga is fated to be in turmoil forever."
POLITICS_MWENDA_III_DESC:0 "Rising to the throne after the passing of his older brother in 1910, Mwami Mwenda III is the son of our first king Mwenda Msiri and the current champion of the Yeke people. Born sometime in the mid 1860’s, the young Kitanika Mabumba as he was known then grew up under the shadow of both Msiri, his father and our founding patriarch, and the colonials. After his father’s assassination in 1891 at the hands of the Belgians, a deep hatred for the colonials was placed in his heart, and it would be something he would struggle with even as a man. Once his brother passed and he ascended, Mwami Mwenda was forced to face reality as the imperialists encroached ever further on their lands and further oppressed their people. Seeing diplomacy as their only way out, Mwami Mwenda put aside his long-festering hate and bowed to the Kaiser to save his own subjects, allowing his people to become semi-autonomous within their own chiefdom protectorate. With this move, the Yeke people have enjoyed a higher standard of living than they have in ages, but at a price, for their kingdom is a puppet to some higher power. \n\nAs the decades of this cooperation wore on, and the failures of the colonial regime to keep their promises continued, Mwami Mwenda III and his people began to grow restless once more. Orchestrating a rebellion against the Ryckmans regime, this insurrection came to head when the Mwami and the Force Publique waged open war within Katanga before being crushed finally in 1936. It was this rebellion that finally made it clear to the Mwami that the Germans could not be trusted, and as such he went into hiding with his loyalists until the time was right to strike. With the opportunity to revolt once again appearing with the Congo Crisis, the Mwami led his troops on a guerilla campaign to take back Katanga for the Yeke. Toppling the UMHK’s monopoly under their zealous might, the Mwami’s forces have saved Katanga from imperialism. \n\nMwami Mwenda III now reigns as a true and sovereign King, bowing to no King nor Kaiser. Taking the honorific Mushalila, meaning ‘one who stays behind to take care of the people’s problems’, Mwenda III seeks to create a strong and regal Garangaze once more. Though his health is slowly failing as this honored noble ages, all in the new Yeke Kingdom revere him as a true hero - as both the saviour of our people and the restorer of our national honor."
POLITICS_MWENDA_IV_DESC:0 "With the passing of his older brother Mwenda Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila, the father of our restored kingdom and our national savior, Munongo Ntanga has risen to become the fourth Mwami in the line Msiri, his long-dead father, started. Born in 1875 and only a decade or so younger than his predecessor, Munongo is experienced as a man and as a noble, but not as a king. Taking his father’s name as is the custom, Mwami Mwenda IV has risen to lead the Yeke Kingdom and its people. Differing from his brother, Mwenda IV is no fan of diplomacy or cooperation of any kind with the ex-colonials. Instead, he desires revenge and retribution. However, with the prosperity of the nation at stake, he will likely have to restrain his malice. Regardless of this hatred, Mwenda is expected to follow in his brother’s footsteps and continue where he left off, for this new and inexperienced king would not want to anger his subjects."

UMN_the_union_minere_desc:0 "The Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, or as its more commonly called the Union Minière or UMHK, is a massive mining concern founded as a joint venture by Flandro-Wallonian and Anglo industrial, rail, and mining concerns already operating in the region in 1906. Since then, German interests have increasingly replaced the Anglos as the dominant partner to the Flandro-Wallonian operators, and as such, Germany has been able to benefit from the rich mineral wealth the UMHK extracts from the Earth. With the collapse of Mittelafrika and the Congo Vrijstaat, the UMHK has found itself adrift without the support of Europe for the first time since its foundation, and now they stand as the dominant force of power in Katanga. They must resist the swirling chaos that now engulfs them as it consumes the Congo, even as whispers of an old foe’s return circulate these jungles."

Shinkolobwe, one of the world’s largest uranium mines, has now been rescued by the forces of Commando 5. Mad Mike Hoare, sensing the usefulness of such a prize, had begun to work with Sengier and other UMHK officials to reopen the mine and scavenge it for all readily-available processed uranium it has in its deep stores. What these madmen plan to do with this deadly and radioactive material is not yet known to the wider Katangese public, but many rumors have swirled that the men of Commando 5 are desperate for anything powerful enough to ensure their independence."

Somehow, despite living in one of the most wild and frontier-like regions on Earth and entirely disconnected from the wider outside world, Mad Mike and the UMHK have apparently been able to requisition a working nuclear device. Though no outside sources have been able to corroborate this claim and many nuclear experts across the globe have decried this as nothing but an impossible bluff, that has not assuage Hoare, who vehemently claims he and his men in Commando 5 have harnessed the powers of God himself, and now shall smite any foe foolish or daring enough to try to take his new fiefdom from him. The world now watches this small hermit fiefdom with wary eyes, not knowing if the infamous Mad Mike is mad enough to nuke Africa to ensure his independence."

unionminere.0.t.mwami:0 "The Mwami Triumphant"
unionminere.0.d:0 "Our forces have achieved victory, thus ending this costly conflict and achieving security for our operations, for war is bad for our business as we are miners and economists, not war profiteers. Our paid native and mercenary forces have pushed out and destroyed the myriad opposition that were so hellbent on total dominance of the Congo that they were willing to destroy all those who wished to do “good” or even just survive. Now with us firmly in control we can ensure that the people of the Congo have the welfare and work that will help forge them into a modern nation. Of course, they will have to make some deals for that to happen first."
unionminere.0.d.mwami:0 "Victory has finally come to the people of the Congo, for finally the colonizers have been pushed out in our fervent strikes to regain our lands. The heir to our lost kingdom has returned and has led the Garanganze peoples down from the mountain and out from the jungles to rescue our fellow man from colonial servitude and any further conflict between the White Man and their utilization of forced servitude. Now we once more have a realm of our own, for the Yeke Kingdom rises again!"
unionminere.0.a:0 "A victory for the people."

unionminere.1.t:0 "The Largest Company in Congo"
unionminere.1.d:0 "No company or other single entity within Congo is more economically dominant than the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga. Formed in 1906 as a joint venture of the Flandro-Wallonian Compagnie du Katanga and Comite Special du Katanga with the Anglo company Tanganyika Concessions LTD., the UMHK has grown over the decades to become dominant like none other. Controlling mines, refineries, factories, processing and shipping centers, their own rail infrastructure, and so much more, this monopoly of monopolies rivals the East India Company in its influence and power. Having a controlling interest in roughly 70% of the Congo’s total economy, it is safe to say that this miner’s union effectively controls the financial sector of the Congo. \n\nWith the collapse of the Vrijstaat, the Lead Director of the Union Minière, [UMN.getleader], the UMHK has had to quickly establish a makeshift governmental structure as it has become responsible over swathes of Katanga. This company-turned-state must now establish itself in this rising tide of chaos and destruction, for the wolves circle it at every moment. To the North, mercenaries and native Askari have risen up to fight for their right of sovereignty, and within our own borders, whispers have spread of the Mwami’s return. We must remain vigilant as we build up our new corporate state, for even all the money in the world can not save us if we fail now."
unionminere.1.a:0 "To Good Health, Good Spirits, and High Productivity!"

unionminere.2.t:0 "Our Benefactors in Katanga Make an Offer"
unionminere.2.d:0 "The capitalist-dominated provisional government in Haut-Katanga under Director Edgar Sengier has petitioned our government to join their growing coalition of colonialist holdouts. If we accepted, we would be forced under the rule of the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga and Sengier, throwing away our sovereignty for mere autonomy under their control. Alternatively, we could just deny this ludicrous request, but as a result we may have to face the wrath of the UMHK on the open battlefield. How shall we respond?"
unionminere.2.a:0 "The Force Publique needs no greed-fueled benefactors any longer."
unionminere.2.b:0 "With their capital funding our state, we shall be unstoppable!"

unionminere.3.t:0 "An Unprofitable Denial"
unionminere.3.d:0 "The fools that run the Force Publique provisional government in Leopoldville have denied our request for unification, and now we are left with a choice. We could either merely forget this transgression and leave them to their own fate, or we could triumphantly march into Leopoldville and cut these traitors down for good. How shall we proceed?"
unionminere.3.a:0 "Send in the Mercs and the Union guards, for the Force Publique falls today!"
unionminere.3.b:0 "We do not need these decadent urban fools."

unionminere.4.t:0 "A Deal is Struck"
unionminere.4.d:0 "Our likeminded allies and countrymen in the Force Publique of Leopoldville have accepted our generous request at unification. With their acceptance, we shall move immediately towards integrating their lands and regime into our own. The Congo is one step closer to total unification and stability!"
unionminere.4.a:0 "May our cooperation prove fruitful as colonial rule is reconsolidated."

unionminere.5.t:0 "The Vrijstaat Calls Once More"
unionminere.5.d:0 "The resurgent Vrijstaat has beaten back the mercenary and native hordes, and now stand as the dominant power in the Congo once again. With their victory, these imperialists have come knockin on our doors once more asking for us to reintegrate ourselves back into the wider Vrijstaat’s colonial government. If we were to accept, we would be fully integrated back into their borders, though given autonomy and extra incentives and benefits for agreeing to holster our weapons for the good of our employees and our profit margins. However, we could just simply deny these fools instead, seeing as they already failed their previous mandate to rule, though doing so would likely incur their wrath. How shall we respond?"
unionminere.5.a:0 "Together, for the good of the colony."
unionminere.5.b:0 "What was the point of this revolt then?! Deny them at once!"

unionminere.6.t:0 "A New Wave of Worker Unrest"
unionminere.6.d:0 "As the atmosphere of instability continues to grow within Katanga due to the violent and chaotic civil war, tensions within our struggling corporate state have risen near the breaking point. Miners and refinery workers across the plots and properties held by the UMHK have risen up in strike and protest, demanding better pay, safer working conditions, and shorter shifts along with other minor social welfare, for they have realized that they are the lifeblood of our company and our power. Worse still, due to our recently ‘earned’ independence, our workforce has been greatly limited, increasing the damage these rapidly spreading strikes have done to our economy and political influence. Without the money flowing and the gears of industry spinning, greased with the promise of profit and opportunity, our hold over Katanga will quickly crumble. We are a literal corporate state, and without a functioning and profitable corporation, our regime is not only doomed to fail but is virtually non-existent. These riots and strikes will need to be dealt with soon lest we desire for our feeble hold over this expanse to collapse, especially with the rumors of old foes regaining their strength in the dense jungles that surround and isolate us."
unionminere.6.a:0 "We will watch these strikes like hawks as we devise a plan forward."

unionminere.7.t:0 "A Possible Response to the Riots"
unionminere.7.d:0 "The various disconnected strikes, riots, and protests across Katanga have coalesced into a cohesive general strike, grinding the apparatus of the state to a complete standstill. With this crisis not having reached such a critical stage, many within the UMHK’s administration had called for drastic and harsh action to be taken to deal with the riots. These scared tycoons and captains of industry seek to pay off as many mercenaries as possible to function as emergency strike breakers while using refugees from the civil war as underpaid strike scabs. This sweeping plan would hopefully crush the spirits of these protestors as we move to consolidate our rule. \n\nHowever, many on the Board of Directors feel that this plan is far too drastic, likely to cause more problems than it would solve and only further angering the native Africans. These more level-headed administrators believe that only through negotiation with these strikers can there be any hope of peace, and Edgar Sengier has expressed his sympathy with this more moderate group behind closed doors. Whatever our Board’s final decision is, we must make it delicately, for Katanga inches closer to collapse by the day."
unionminere.7.a:0 "Heed Sengier’s warnings and work towards a peaceful solution."
unionminere.7.b:0 "Send in the scabs and mercs, it's strikebreaking time!"

unionminere.8.t:0 "Old Foes Reemerge"
unionminere.8.d:0 "With our decision to crack down harshly on the African workers striking against our regime, old foes have begun to rise from the primordial expanses of Katanga and beyond. From within the jungles and disconnected villages that remain untouched by our monopoly has once again risen the Mwami, heir to the Yeke Kingdom and ‘rightful’ ruler of Katanga. Patriarch of the Bayeke, or Garanganze, people and noble descendent of the Msiri, Mwami Kitanika and his loyal forces wage a guerilla war against our regime as they did against Ryckmans before us. Though his forces are dwindling due to his failed war against the Vrijstaat, he has still proven to be a thorn in our side, and some believe he is to blame for the recent rise in protests and strikes. Though this claim is dubious, with the protest more likely forming as a response to both our new rule in the wake of the civil war and our abhorrent managerial practices, this has not stopped the Mwami from becoming a scapegoat for our issues. With our situation growing more dire by the minute and with our resources already stretched so thin, our regime must make a choice. Should we waste precious weapons, supplies, and manpower, all resources we have little to spare, to deal with this minor tribalist threat to show the nation that something is being done to deal with the unrest, or shall we simply let this mad king rave as we deal with the larger issues at hand."
unionminere.8.a:0 "Break out the rifles, boys! It’s time to hunt some guerillas."
unionminere.8.b:0 "The last ditch efforts of a failed king are trivial. Let us return to our brandy and cigars."

unionminere.9.t:0 "The Mwami Plays His Hand Once More"
unionminere.9.d:0 "We have been foolish, too busy pursuing profit and dealing with the strikers, too long ignoring the rising tribalist threat, and now it may be too late to save our precious capitalist experiment. Even now, the forces of Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila and his brother Munongo march against us, and across Katanga more and more of our outlying mines and outposts go dark, failing to hail back to us on any frequency. These centers of our influence have slipped away without so much as a word of notice, and with each that falls, our hold over Katanga grows ever weaker. \n\nIn a final showdown outside the UMHK’s main compound in Elisabethville, the soul of Katanga is on the line as a large force of Mwami loyalists, all fervent supporters of the House of Msiri."
unionminere.9.a:0 "All that is needed is a bit of lead paid in gold; send in the mercs."
unionminere.9.b:0 "The Mwami, heir of the great Msiri and father of the Bayeke people, seizes power."

unionminere.10.t:0 "The Rebirth of the Yeke Kingdom"
unionminere.10.d:0 "The impossible has been completed - the colonialist dogs that have long infected the Congo have been cast out - and now the Bayeke people of Katanga breathe free air once again for the first time in decades. Mwami Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila and his brother, heirs to Msiri and champions of the people of Garanganze, are the liberators of Katanga, and now shall oversee the recreation of their ancestral kingdom. Pushing for a return to tradition, expanding resource extraction, consolidation of power under the Mwami’s kingdom, and slight reforms to model this resurgent monarchy after the enlightened Chrstian monarchies of Europe, the Mwami and his loyal forces shall finally free Katanga from the vices of colonialism and drag these primordial lands into the future, without losing sight of their tradition and tribalist roots."
unionminere.10.a:0 "The Yeke Kingdom rises once more atop the ashes of the UMHK."

unionminere.11.t:0 "Our Greatest Diplomatic Asset"
unionminere.11.d:0 "Of all the resource extraction sites, miners, and refineries within the Congo under the control of the UMHK, none is more important than Shinkolobwe. Also known as Kasolo or Chinkolobew, this massive mine at the heart of the Kambove mining region in Katanga is one of the largest single deposits of uranium on Earth, providing untold amounts of uranium and radium for us to extract and sell. With recent scientific advances, the potential of such a material is quickly being realized, and every great power on the planet is chomping at the bit for access to any known deposits of the stuff. \n\nThis lucrative nature could prove to be our greatest bargaining chip, as every nation with a hand in international diplomacy seeks to harness the power of this ore for themselves, yet most lack the necessary access to uranium and other elements like it to do it. With this in mind, we shall use our stores of uranium as leverage as we seek to find new allies to protect our newly independent capitalist haven. The most beneficial candidates for us to reach out to are of course Germany and the Entente - both the current and former colonial overlords of Africa. Whoever we reach out to shall be offered the necessary materials to unlock and harness the secrets of the atom, and all they need to do in return is supply our troops and keep our borders safe."
unionminere.11.a:0 "Reach out to the Kaiserreich, for they are the true and proven hegemon."
unionminere.11.b:0 "Though in exile, the Entente has proven their righteousness. Reach out to Ottawa."

unionminere.12.t:0 "Nuclear-Fueled Overtures From Katanga"
unionminere.12.d:0 "We have received a curious yet enticing proposal from the far-off land of Katanga, nestled in the southern reaches of the Congo. From this primordial eden, the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga has petitioned our regime with a most unexpected request. These capitalists have unmitigated access and ownership over Shinkolobwe, one of the world’s largest uranium mines. They have offered full access to their stores of this precious fissile material under the condition that we admit them into our alliance and offer them our protection. While doing so would further entangle us within African affairs, it would also align us with one of the richest and largest companies in Africa - and the only one both functioning as an independent state and with such easy access to one of the most sought-after materials on the planet. We must decide how to go about this situation, for this deal could change the face of history as we know it."
unionminere.12.a:0 "Accept the ore, for Germany shall harness its power for Gott und Kaiser."
unionminere.12.b:0 "Perhaps, on second thought, we should pursue other avenues to unlock the secrets of the atom."

unionminere.14.t:0 "Nuclear-Fueled Overtures from Katanga"

unionminere.14.b:0 "On second thought, we should pursue other avenues to unlock the secrets of the atom."

unionminere.15.t:0 "Mining Fever"
unionminere.15.d:0 "Though the Union Minère started as a union of separate companies and once primarily dealt in the copper trade, our monopoly has shed these humble beginnings and now not only do we mine copper and build rails - we mine everything! The earth beneath our feet in this Dark Heart is chock full of various minerals, ores, and other raw materials, and our beloved UMHK mines it all. From tons of diamond and gold to our mainstays of copper, chromium, and cobalt, as well as iron, coal and oil, tungsten, zinc, and just about every major needed metal and mineral needed by modern man - curiously except for aluminum due to our lack of local bauxite deposits. We have even begun to mine uranium, making us one of the only functional, as well as the largest, running uranium mine in the world, which has brought new demand to our miners unlike never seen before as the rising great powers of the world and even the old hegemon the Kaiserrreich itself seek this radioactive rock. \n\nNot stopping with the bounties of the ore seams and caverns, our monopoly also lords over massive timber orchards, agricultural and pastoral fields, rubber plantations, rail companies, and even a massive string of dockyards in Matadi and along the Zambezi. Virtually every facet of the Congo’s varied and bountiful economy is either fully within our control or at least runs through our hands so that we may influence it and skim from the profits. Mining and money-making is all we know, but God be damned we are the best at it!"
unionminere.15.a:0 "Uranium fever has got us diggin’ down."

unionminere.16.t:0 "The New Congolese Industrial Revolution"
unionminere.16.d:0 "The skies over Elizabethville were black with smog as light acid rain drizzled down upon the city, lightly singing soft materials and irritating the skin of any that walked through it for too long. The local tributary of the Congo river was virtually sludge - its once clear and brisk rapids now reduced to a viscous pool of oil-slicked goo. The city’s structures and homes were all blackened by accumulating soot as the never-ending clang of heavy machinery and cacophony of modernity and progress filled the air, along with the stench of rotting trash and sulfur. This dismal sight and environmental devastation was just a side-effect - a mere hiccup - on the road to a truly modern and industrial Congo. \n\nUnder Edgar Sengier and the UMHK, it is as if the very clock has been turned back to the 1800s as a new industrial revolution seizes the Congo in its grip, with the Union Minère pouring everything and anything they can muster into the effort. In just a few short years, Katanga and the wider Congo have rapidly begun to evolve into a modern and industrialized economic powerhouse, showcasing possibly the fastest degree of industrialization ever seen in history as Sengier and the Board of Directors work endlessly to bring further profit into their pockets and to send further resources out into the world to our valued trade partners. With new factories, new miners, new refinery plants, and so on being built and staffed each day, and with Sengier still scheming and planning for ever higher profits, there does not seem to be an end in sight. Under this new industrial revolution, the Congo shall be rich and affluent unlike any post-colonial state has ever seen, and Sengier and his monopoly now sit like merchant-kings atop their ever-growing hoard of profit."
unionminere.16.a:0 "With steam and steel, we shall bring modernity to the Congo."

unionminere.17.t:0 "The Guiding Hand of Civilization"
unionminere.17.d:0 "The UMHK is already the largest company in the Congo and one of the largest in Africa, with the controlling interest group of the company virtually owning 70% of our total economic output. With this great amount of economic achievement and industrial progress already achieved, Sengier and his UMHK have decided to slow down the rapid industrialization process to instead take time and effort to relieve the plight of our local citizens and employees while also reforming the UMHK into a more functional and traditional government. Though the monopoly will still call all the shots, Sengier has pushed to create a civilian council within the company and below the Board of Directors to serve as liaisons and representatives for the Congolese populace while also functioning as watchdogs to ensure the UMHK keeps its operations above board and moral. Though the old colonial order is dead, that does not mean we must abandon these people that we have now found ourselves in charge of, and Sengier is seemingly determined to make right on past wrongdoings. The UMHK, using its vast fortunes and influence, shall become the ultimate civilizing tool, bringing the light of Western Civilization and all its trappings to our peoples. This will not only appease the local Congolese, thus stabilizing our regime, but it shall also work to uplift and support each and every citizen in our capitalist state, creating a true haven, both economically and socially, here within Africa’s Dark Heart."
unionminere.17.a:0 "You can attract a lot more flies with honey than you can with vinegar..."

unionminere.18.t:0 "The Monopoly with a Heart"
unionminere.18.d:0 "Though we are a capitalist monopoly and once were part of the old oppressive colonial order, that does not mean that our UMHK must follow in their heartless, soulless example. Under our employ are literally millions of Congolese souls, both native and ex-colonials, and they must be protected - both to ensure their safety and good livelihood as much as our own. Our workers shall be allowed to unionize within non-Socialist, Christian or secualrly based, state-approved unions, granting them minor bargaining power and better protections against our managers and taskmasters. Each of our workers must be well paid, enough so that they may live their lives comfortably without fear of homelessness or starvation, and working conditions across the UMHK’s factories and other holdings have begun to improve to lower injury and mortality rates for those under our employ. To encourage more to join our ranks, we shall grant full rights and protections, as well as extra economic and social incentives, to any Congolese citizen that has at least one family member within our payroll, effectively forcing at least one person in each family to come work for us. Any family that refuses shall simply be forced to be second class citizens, still supported and taken care of by the UMHK’s government, but not with the same gusto and not with the same level of care as the ‘Union Families’ that have begun to become the favored class of Sengier and his Board of Directors. Though far from a perfect system, this system works for the Congo and the UMHK, and under their lead, this primordial paradise shall rise to become the first true corporate state of the modern age, all without crushing its employees and citizens under its step to get there."
unionminere.18.a:0 "Only fools say corporations must be soulless."

unionminere.19.t:0 "Showcasing our Innovations"
unionminere.19.d:0 "To showcase our economic miracle and the great works we do here in the Congo, Edgar Sengier and his right-hand man Jules Cousins have invited the biggest economic and industrial figures from across the globe to come meet in Katanga to witness the modern age’s first true and pure corporate state. With the UMHK being so world renowned and beloved by the global elite for the amount of pure profit it outputs, as well as out of morbid curiosity, many famous faces have responded to the invitation with a resounding yes, setting this meeting up to be one of the largest meetings of economic minds since the Berlin Economic Conference of 1933. \n\nWith the conference well underway, Sengier showcased their newest innovations in mining and refinery technology, wowing the likes Henry Ford, Alfried Krupp, John Rockefeller, and Harvey Firestone, while our newest advances in blasting charges, rail technology, and many other fields drew the attention of many more like Sylvanus Olympio, Kumakichi Nakajima, Paul van Zeeland, John Keynes, Irving Fisher, and other various economists, bankers, and captains of finance and industry that came to visit our beloved paradise. \n\nThe conference was a resounding success, with Sengier signing new contracts and making new lucrative deals with many of the attendees, most notably hammering out a private deal with some influential Germans and Americans securing these foreigners a small taste of our uranium stockpile so that they may run tests on the odd, radioactive little rocks. With new allies and partners found and our successes showcased to the world, Sengier and the Board have never been more sure that their new corporate state shall actually survive as a working, functioning political entity on the world stage, for we know what the greedy and the ambitious want, and only we can supply it."
unionminere.19.a:0 "Captains of Industry of the world, unite!"

unionminere.20.t:0 "A New Honorary Director of the UMHK"
unionminere.20.d:0 "With the fall of Berlin and the Fatherland, the Kaiserreich has begun to crumble worldwide, and these tremors can be felt here in our tropical paradise as well. Seeking to show support to our fallen Kaiser while announcing to the world that we are still a holding bastion of the German Empire, Director Edgar Sengier has decided to grant Kaiser Wilhelm an honorary title befitting his grandeur while still aligning with our interests and methods here at the UMHK. Declaring Wilhelm as the new ‘Großer Direktor’, or Grand Director, of the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga. To match this affirmation of loyalty to the Kaiserreich, the UMHK has been christened as the Bergarbeitergewerkschaft von Nord-Katanga, or the BGNK, though this name is merely just a translation of our original name and is entirely ceremonial. With Kaiser Wilhelm standing as the new honorary face of our monopoly, Katanga and our holdings have been transformed into one of the last pro-German colonial holdouts on Earth. Though our operations shall largely continue as they did before this motion, it has done a great deal to improve moral within our colony, and although many loyalists to Brussels find this move a tad bit disturbing, they can do little but grumble their displeasure as we continue with our economic efforts here in the Congo. As long as they keep getting paid and the capital continues to flow, it matters not, for at the end of the day, the only true king here in Katanga is cash."
unionminere.20.a:0 "By his grace, our conglomerate shall only prosper."

## Mwami Events 
mwami.1.t:0 "The Fallout of the Congo Crisis"
mwami.1.d:0 "After carefully planned outmaneuvering and hard-fought victories, we have managed to come out of the Congo Crisis not only still standing, but also as the sole victors. The vast expanse of the Congo, from the thundering river that gives these lands their name to the great rainforests that smother the interior, is now under our control, at least nominally, for the bulk of our enemies have surrendered, and those that have not have instead been forced into hiding. However, the extent of our ancestors’ kingdom founded by the Msiri did not even encompass all of Katanga at its zenith. With this in mind, we have resolved to take all of Katanga as our prize, and have begun the process of releasing the rest of this war-torn quagmire so that they may deal with the mess they caused themselves. However, we must decide how to leave our former enemies, for their national future is at the mercy of our mighty armies. \n\nWe could either simply restore the Yeke Kingdom of old in Katanga and secede fully from the rest of the Congo, leaving the Northerners to figure out their own way in their newly established republic. Alternatively, we could not only restore the legacy of the great Msiri, but we could also entirely shatter the budding sense of Congolese nationalism by balkanizing the Congo completely. This would leave the once mighty Vrijstaat a shadow of its former self as the Congo is reduced to a small number of independent states. The choice, as always in matters of this level of importance, lies with our king, the Mwami."

In the name of glory for King Leopold II, bloodthirsty warmongerers from Europe came to our domain with the sole intention of subjugation. The names of Omer Bodson and William Stairs are etched into our history, as they wronged us so long ago. Those names are the ones who fashioned our manacles and subjected us to servitude to those who would see our culture stamped out forever. The white men have since forgotten their transgressions against our people, as, to this day, they continue to encroach on our beloved land. \n\nWe, however, have not forgotten. \n\n Now that our rule is consolidated over the swathes of Africa we call home, we can now restore rule and riches to those who deserve it: us. Colonists were given a seven-day period to leave our borders or face repercussions; unfortunately, it seemed that many did not take heed of our generous offer. While our mail system is not the most polished in the world, we could have sworn that we sent out this mandate to all it affected! Oh well. The shock and fear on their doggish, pale faces were almost enough to make our soldiers laugh as they cut man, woman, and child down. Word went out amongst the white communities, but they were often too late. Depending on the commanding officer, some were taken into custody, whereas other officers allowed their soldiers to kill, rape, and plunder anything so long as it wasn’t from here. Some of the useful ones were allowed to live if they pledged their service to our Mwami. These included the wretched miners who plunder and suck our land dry, for their expertise and equipment will now be used to support our regime. This is the first step to purge our land from the disease of colonialism and the first step to restoring the Garanganze to the glory they so deserve!"

The members of our people living in the city can now benefit from technology and a way of life never seen before in the Congo, we owe a lot to our European industrialist allies, notably the Union Minière, without whom this project would surely never have been possible. That is why in order to thank them, the Mwami has placed the vast majority of the new industries created by the modernization of Lubumbashi in the hands of European investors, which will not fail to create new jobs for the people.\n\nAfter such a success, our administration obviously does not intend to stop there as many new industrialization and modernization projects are now being prepared by the Mwami and our European allies. The most ambitious and costly, but also surely the most profitable of these plans is the modernization of our capital Bunkeya."
mwami.4.a:0 "From a locality into a metropolis, all for the glory of the Yeke Kingdom."

mwami.5.t:0 "The Rebirth of the Yeke Trade Network"
mwami.5.d:0 "With our connections to the ex-colonial economic and trade networks now cut-off from us with our decision to exile and eradicate imperialist influences, our economy has begun to struggle greatly under the weight of independence. Our revived kingdom needs to be self-sufficient and free from neo-colonialist urges. To do so, the Mwami has announced the recreateation of the old Yeke Trade Network that used to dominate mercantile interactions in East and Central Africa for decades. \n\nWe shall prepare the caravans and convoys once more, selling our famed copper and other ores to the various groups of post-Collapse Africa. From the sultans of Zanzibar to the villages that line the Zambezi and Congo rivers, we shall revive our old trade contacts and resign the old deals that fueled our economy in the past so that we may finally be totally free of colonialist economic systems and practices. Not shirking any part of our traditions, we shall even bring back the slave trade that proved so proftiable in the past, with prisoners of war, religious herectics, and traitors to the throne all being tossed into shackles to be shipped to their new masters. In exchange for the slaves, ores, and other raw resources we shall sell, new weapons of war and other modern technologies shall be brought back to Beunkeya so that we may further modernize Garanganze without losing sight of our past and our traditions. With this trade network revived, the Mwami dreams of turning our kingdom from the backwater it is now into the envy of post-Collapse Africa."
mwami.5.a:0 "Upon the backs of these caravans, we place our future."

mwami.6.t:0 "Ex-Colonial Experts ‘Willingly’ Lend a Hand"
mwami.6.d:0 "Although we are making every effort to create a kingdom truly free of European influence, reality tends to catch up with us and the loss of European intellect has negatively impacted our homeland. However, for every problem there is a solution, and our administration has found one for this one. Technical experts, intellectuals and former colonial administrators captured during the Congolese Civil War are now being recruited into our ranks to help modernize our country. Of course, one would think that these imperialists would never serve our kingdom willingly, but it turns out that these Europeans are far more likely to accept our requests if we threaten them with death and torture before their eyes, using their comrades stupid enough to dare refuse our generous offer of redemption as a harsh lesson to witness.\n\nWith this new policy and the help of these Europeans, the Mwami intends to modernize the country as quickly and efficiently as possible and to train a new generation of native experts and intellectuals that will allow us to completely liberate our country and our people from colonial influence in the future."
mwami.6.a:0 "Shackled and under our command, they shall cleanse their past sins with loyalty."

mwami.7.t:0 "Piety For Unity"
mwami.7.d:0 "Though the Mwami had only recently fully converted to the Catholic faith - the first Mwami to fully and officially do so, though the first Mwami the Misiri also was quite friendly to Christianity - that did not mean that he was not devout. Fully diving into the faith with gusto and piety, the Mwami has begun a campaign to spread the Catholic religion throughout Garanganze, both in an effort to unite his myriad subjects and to soothe relations with our colonial allies even further. Declaring the missionaries would be allowed free passage anywhere within the kingdom, the Mwami has begun to lift many of the old restrictions placed upon the European faiths and their preachers, granting them more freedom as well as an official seal of approval from the throne, meaning that if anyone harmed these pious itinerants, the perpetrator would be forced to face justice at the hand of the King. To capstone this new path of religious cooperation and coexistence, the Mwami has announced that a new cathedral shall be built within the capital of Bunkeya, deep in the heart of the Kaleba district which is filled with nunneries, missionary outposts, and hospitals and sickhouses run by clergymen both of European and native faiths. By building a new temple dedicated to our newly shared God, the Mwami shall bridge the gap between the two halves of our kingdom, hopefully bringing unity through faith to the Yeke Kingdom."
mwami.7.a:0 "Under the White Man’s God, our Kingdom shall find peace."

mwami.8.t:0 "A Return to Pre-Colonial Norms"
mwami.8.d:0 "The taint of European religion has long existed within Katanga, but only since 1938 has our Mwami officially called himself a Catholic. However, with the Europeans no longer lording over our King and with the Yeke Kingdom fully revived, Mwami Kitanika Mabumba has finally decided to cast off this false faith of the White Man and return to his nativist roots. In a public declaration from the central forum, or the Milumba, in Bunkeya, our King has formally renounced the Catholic faith and the Pope in Rome. Surrounded by Garanganzean priests and holymen, he was anointed with blessed waters and painted with traditional pigments before the ritual began to indoctrinate the Mwami’s soul into his native faith. \n\nDrawing from the honored Msiri, the Mwami’s father and our kingdom’s founder, the Mwami has converted back to the Nyamwezi people’s faith like that of his father, praising their gods like Likube and Limatunda as he forsakes the Christian God. A diverse faith, the Mwami’s new religion also calls for ancestor worship and filial piety above other pursuits, with spirit communing through witchdoctors, or Mfumu, and animal sacrifices also being common practices. This newly resurgent native faith shall be spread by the Mwami, as well as a plethora of other local faiths and religions, so that the influence of Christianity within our kingdom can finally be eradicated. All old colonial priests and missionaries shall be barred from their parishes and churches and banned from preaching or proselytizing. Anyone foolish enough caught doing so shall face the full wrath of the Mwami, for no longer is he keen on bending to a White God."
mwami.8.a:0 "The Mwami has rightfully forsaken the foreign faith of the White Devils."

mwami.9.t:0 "The Death of the King"
mwami.9.d:0 "Tragic news burst forth from Bunkeya this morning over the sudden death of Mwami Mwenda Kitanika Mabumba Mushalila, the ‘great one who stays behind to care for his people’ as his honorific title Mushalila means. Long a champion of our people and now infamous as the king who saved us from colonialism, Mwenda III as he was officially known has been widely regarded by our people as the second coming of Msiri - our first king and Kitanika Mabumba’s father - owing to his great strides at improving the lives of his subjects and his fellow man. \n\nPassing in his sleep after suffering from a slew of health issues and surrounded by friends and family, this old national hero peacefully departed this world to enter the next, and in his place, the new Mwami shall rise. Just a few years younger than his predecessor, Munongo Musamfya Ntanga shall soon be crowned as Mwenda IV, taking the place of his now deceased brother atop the Yeke throne. Less friendly to the ex-colonials than his deceased brother, many now wonder how our new king shall rule these lands, for shall he follow in the footsteps of Msiri and Mwenda III, or shall he blaze a new path for the Garanganze people."
mwami.9.a:0 "May your ancestors guide your soul to the afterlife, and may the new Mwami serve us well!"

mwami.10.t:0 "The Bunkeya Renaissance"
mwami.10.d:0 "As part of his revival of old Garanganze culture as well as a part of his quest to truly modernize and bring prosperity to the people of the Yeke Kingdom, the Mwami has called for a mass construction campaign to begin in the capital of Bunkeya, to transform this dated tribal complex into a more modern example of a true city. Bunkeya shall be dragged into modernity without losing sight of our culture and traditions, for this city was our original capital, and though the last Mwami moved the throne temporarily to another city, Mwenda III moved it back to Bunkeya upon taking the throne nearly two decades ago. In the time since, the city has seen a great deal of innovations, primarily thanks to lucrative deals made with the European colonials for assistance. However, the city still needs much to be considered a modern urban center, and the Mwami is determined to do so. New governmental offices and administrative centers shall be built in the Milumba - the central forum and town square of the city that sits below the looming shadow of the Mwami’s hilltop palace - to serve as the new heart of our regime and its functions. Munema, the hallowed site where Msiri was brutally and cowardly assassinated by Belgian colonial Captain Bodson, shall be transformed into a new royal cemetery, where the various nobles and blue-bloods of our kingdom shall be interred upon their deaths, as well as any national hero the Mwami deems fit, and a new mausoleum shall be erected in the Munema district’s center, serving as a monument and new resting place for our first king. To finalize these plans, which also includes new public works projects, new funding for state-mandated art and music, and a push for modernized infrastructure and wider plumbing, the Mwami’s hilltop palace is also to be renovated. A longhouse-type palace resting upon wooden stilts and overlooking the city from atop the central Lupili, this decades-old palace shall be modernized and made far more extravagant. With its exterior palisade wall raised and the waterless moat deepened, the palace would be made more defensible, while the local well was to be redug and cleaned, and by using loot and gifts from the failed colonial regime, the Mwami ordered for his local favored artists and builders to spruce up its opulent interior. Not just seeking to improve his own home however, the surrounding Kimpata district, filled with numerous smaller settlements and neighborhoods populated by both Yeke nobles and commoners, was also to be renovated, with the priority being to bring clean water and electricity to their homes. Though this modernization and expansion process shall take a great deal of time and capital, it shall be our first step on the road to traditionalist modernization. "
mwami.10.a:0 "Under our glorious Mwami, old traditions and new ideas have been fused for our betterment."

mwami.11.t:0 "The Mwami’s Bogeymen"
mwami.11.d:0 "Long standing as spectres and devils who spread chaos across our cities and towns, and particularly within Bunkeya, local streetgangs of unemployed young men and ex-soldiers known as the Ruga-Ruga have terrorized the cities of Garanganze for years. First taking their frustrations out on colonials and missionaries, ambushing them and slaughtering them or simply just robbing them blind, our kingdom’s new direction calls for more tact and less chaotic and disorganized outbursts, and such the Ruga-Ruga must be reigned in. However, the ruffians are still our loyal citizens, each of them fervently loyal to the Mwami and the Yeke Kingdom as a whole, and as such these criminals may be of some use to us. \n\nTo put these red-blooded patriots to good use, the Mwami has decreed that all members of the Ruga-Ruga gangs are to be given a simple choice: be conscripted into our military and trained as the personal, zealous bodyguard and hitsquad of the Mwami, or face jail or even death for your past crimes. Not ones to pass up on an easy opportunity for a better life, the members of the Ruga-Ruga began to sign up in droves, and after just a few short weeks, most of their numbers have been enrolled into training camps to begin their service to the throne. However, not all were so smart or brave to join our ranks, and most of their numbers have been instead pressed into manual labour as they serve out their sentences under lock and key, but at least those that are now labourers can still contribute to the Kingdom. Their more dangerous and violent friends that did not answer the call to conscription have instead gone to serve the kingdom another way - as a lesson and a warning to their fellow man as their bodies are lowered into the ground or burned to ash; a lesson to never cross the Mwami if you value your life."
mwami.11.a:0 "The Ruga-Ruga shall be forged into the throne’s most fervent defenders."


## Katanta Events 

katanga.1.t:0 "The Fallout of Tshombe’s Gamble"
katanga.1.d:0 "After weeks and months of bloody civil war, President Moïse Tshombe has been able to defeat the ANC using his mercenary allies and colonial backing from the UMHK. With this hard-earned victory, Tshombe now stands as the sole figure of power in the Congo, at least for a moment, and now has free reign to carve up his prize as he sees fit. \n\nBefore him lay a few possible options for how to deal with the vast swathe of land he has just come intro control of. Tshombe could simply leave the rest of the Congo to their own devices, breaking Katanga off from the larger whole and leaving the fools in Kinshasa to fend for themselves as Tshombe reaps the profits and rewards of his hard work, saving him the headache of ruling over all of Congo. Alternatively, Tshombe could reinstate the Congolese Republic, declaring himself as President of all Congo while likely still heavily favoring his home region. In direct opposition to these ideas, Tshombe could also instead move to balkanzie the Congo entirely, shattering the colonially-forged makeshift borders destroying the idea of a unified Congo completely. If he were to take this more drastic solution, Tshombe could then either decide to merely leave the newly created states to their own devices, or instead corral them under his influence as satellite governments. In the end, the choice is up to the President, and the rest of the Congo waits with bated breath on his decision."
katanga.1.a:0 "Restore the Congolese Republic, with Tshombe at its head."
katanga.1.b:0 "Break up the Congo entirely and leave them to their own devices!"
katanga.1.c:0 "Break up the Congo and put it under our supervision!"
katanga.1.e:0 "Leave the Congo as is and have Katanga secede under Tshombe."
katanga.1.f:0 "'Mad' Mike Hoare takes the Congo for Himself!"

katanga.2.t:0 "Tshombe's Second in Command"
katanga.2.d:0 "With his ascension to the position of ‘President’ over the State of Katanga, Moïse Tshombe now must decide on who shall be his loyal Vice-President. Though this position is largely ceremonial, since most political power shall truly reside in Tshombe’s hands, it is still a required position to maintain legitimacy in the eyes of the people and the wider world while also helping to share the burden of ruling over this wild frontier. \n\nThe main candidates Tshombe has in mind are his main political ally in CONAKAT - Godefroid Munongo, the leader of Commando 5 and the head of Katanga’s mercenary military - ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare,  the current chairman of the UMHK - Edgar Sengier and the Mwami and heir of the Yeke Kingdom, Mwenda III. Each of these candidates are vital to the overall survival of Katanga, but only one can be Vice-President. Who shall Tshombe choose?"
katanga.2.a:0 "Go with Godefroid Munongo, Tshombe’s right-hand man in CONAKAT."
katanga.2.b:0 "’Mad’ Mike Hoare is the man for Katanga!"
katanga.2.c:0 "Sengier has deep pockets, and deeper connections."
katanga.2.e:0 "The Mwami would be invaluable in keeping the people pacified."
katanga.2.f:0 "Tshombe is already a capable leader."

katanga.3.t:0 "Hoare's Influence Grows"
katanga.3.d:0 "With his nomination from President Moïse Tshombe, Mike Hoare has risen to be the Vice-President of Katanga. With this ascension, Hoare and his men within 5 Commando, also known as the Wild Geese in reference to the 17th century Irish rebels who fought against the Stuarts, have risen to higher levels within the upper echelons of Katanga’s hierarchy, and many within CONAKAT have begun to worry about Mad Mike’s rising influence. President Tshombe has done much to assuage the concerns of his comrades, ensuring them that Mad Mike and his forces are only ensuring that the money continues to flow, denying any accusations that the young merc wants any power for himself. Despite this attempt at soothsaying from the President, many still are wary of the young merc."
katanga.3.a:0 "Nothing to be alarmed about."

katanga.4.t:0 "The UMHK's Influence Grows"
katanga.4.d:0 "With his nomination from President Moïse Tshombe, Edgar Sengier has risen to be the Vice-President of Katanga. With this ascension, Sengier and his associates within the Union Minère du Haut-Katanga, both Katanga’s and Congo’s largest company, have risen to higher levels within the upper echelons of Katanga’s hierarchy, and many within CONAKAT have begun to worry about Sengier’s rising influence. President Tshombe has done much to assuage the concerns of his comrades, ensuring them that the UMHK are only ensuring that the money continues to flow, denying any accusations that the colonials seek power for themselves once more. Despite this attempt at soothsaying from the President, many still are wary of Sengier and his ambitions."
katanga.4.a:0 "Nothing to be alarmed about."

katanga.5.t:0 "Tshombe Takes Off"
katanga.5.d:0 "President Moïse Tshombe has always been a man of leisure and fine tastes. Loving to travel the world in pursuit of greater sights and higher pleasures, it is no surprise to any in the nation that the President is once again departing from Lubumbashi, taking his private plane to God knows where to once again wet his beak with the luxuries of life. With his departure, the leadership of Katanga has been temporarily left to his closest allies like Munongo, Hoare, and Sengier, but all expect Tshombe’s return in a few days - once he’s had his fill of fine wine, finer women, and more gambling and partying than one man should partake in."
katanga.5.a:0 "Safe travels, Mr President!"

katanga.6.t:0 "A Problem with the President's Plane"
katanga.6.d:0 "While soaring high above the clouds in his personal Junkers 52/3m airliner, requisitioned from the Sabena company through his colonial ties, President Tshombe’s nap among the clouds was distrubed by a bit of rough turbulence. Hearing the pilot from the cockpit, it seems the plane collided with a flock of wild African geese, whose heavy frames have collided with the left engine, causing it to fail and causing the plane to slowly drop altitude as it travels thousands of feet above the Atlantic. With time of the essence, the flight crew have begun emergency measures, and now it is up to fate and the crew whether or not they can land this bird and bring our President home safely."
katanga.6.a:0 "Just a bit of avian-caused turbulence, nothing out of the ordinary."
katanga.6.b:0 "We’ve lost contact with Tshombe's plane, and Katanga’s national father is now missing!"

katanga.7.t:0 "Munongo Takes Over for the Late President"
katanga.7.d:0 "With President Moïse Tshombe now missing and presumed dead, a replacement has quickly been named to maintain stability in our chaotic little state. To make the transition as simple and quick as possible, Tshombe’s Vice President Godefroid Munongo has been sworn in as acting President until Tshombe, or his body, is found. Under Munongo, Katanga is expected to take a darker turn as the new President consolidates his position. The chief architect behind Tshombe’s reprisals against the Kasaian peoples like the Baluba, Munongo is expected to increase the regime’s attacks and harsh policies against this troublesome minority. A relative and self-proclaimed heir to the Mwami’s royal line, Munonogo is also expected to massively increase Katanga’s emphasis on the culture of the old Yeke Kingdom while also moving more closely to the Mwami as he distances himself from Hoare and Sengier."
katanga.7.a:0 "More of the same, it seems."

katanga.8.t:0 "Hoare Takes Over for the Late President"
katanga.8.d:0 "With President Moïse Tshombe now missing and presumed dead, a replacement has quickly been named to maintain stability in our chaotic little state. To make the transition as simple and quick as possible, Tshombe’s Vice President Mike Hoare has been sworn in as acting President until Tshombe, or his body, is found. Though he shall tacitly follow the legacy of Tshombe, many expect this facade of respect to drop quickly after Tshombe’s body is still left to be unfound after a few weeks with Hoare as President."
katanga.8.a:0 "This seems familiar."

katanga.9.t:0 "Sengier Takes Over for the Late President"
katanga.9.d:0 "With President Moïse Tshombe now missing and presumed dead, a replacement has quickly been named to maintain stability in our chaotic little state. To make the transition as simple and quick as possible, Tshombe’s Vice President Edgar Sengier has been sworn in as acting President until Tshombe, or his body, is found. Though he shall tacitly follow the legacy of Tshombe, many expect this facade of respect to drop quickly after Tshombe’s body is still left to be unfound after a few weeks with Sengier as President."
katanga.9.a:0 "Really, this again?"

katanga.10.t:0 "Hoare Seizes the Apparatus of State"
katanga.10.d:0 "With his ascension to acting President, ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare and the men of 5 Commando have worked diligently to consolidate their grip over Katanga. With their agents implanted within every major level of the Katanga hierarchy, Hoare has begun to shed the thin veneer of subservience he once had to Tshombe’s legacy, and now had fully broken off to fulfill his own agenda. ‘Mad’ Mike is expected to further militarize Katanga like never before as he and his Wild Geese move to fully transform the Congo into a wild and free merc state. Under Hoare’s regime, adventure, profit, and the ecstasy of combat shall become paramount pillars of the State of Katanga while Tshombe’s influence is washed away for good. Though the UMHK shall still maintain its level of wealth and prominence within Hoare’s new regime, the other old allies of Tshombe like Munongo and the Mwami loyalists have been ousted from the government for good. Now, the world watches as yet another powergrab takes place in Africa’s darkest heart, throwing Katanga and the wider region into chaos once more."

katanga.11.t:0 "The UMHK Seizes the Apparatus of State once More"
katanga.11.d:0 "With his ascension to acting President, Edgar Sengier and the haughty colonials of the UMHK have worked diligently to consolidate their grip over Katanga. With their agents implanted within every major level of the Katanga hierarchy, Sengier has begun to shed the thin veneer of subservience he once had to Tshombe’s legacy, and now had fully broken off to fulfill his own agenda. The UMHK is expected to further industrialize Katanga like never before as he and his business partners move to fully transform the Congo into the most profitable swathe of colonial frontier in the world. Under Sengier’s regime, rampant capitalism and the unending march towards ever-higher profits shall become paramount pillars of the State of Katanga while Tshombe’s influence is washed away for good. Though the mercs of 5 Commando shall still maintain their level of prominence within our military under Sengier’s new regime, the other old allies of Tshombe like Munongo and the Mwami loyalists have been ousted from the government for good. Now, the world watches as yet another powergrab takes place in Africa’s darkest heart, throwing Katanga and the wider region into chaos once more."
katanga.11.a:0 "Again?"

katanga.12.t:0 "Pest Control"
katanga.12.d:0 "The troubled past between the various tribes of Katanga has begun to show yet again. For centuries past, the people of Katanga have had a hatred for the South Kasaians whom many see as the main contributor to the problems we now face. Now that Tshombe, a member of the Lunda, has gained power in our land, he is able to assert his control over the populations in our borders. With the CONAKAT’s support, the President has begun to implement laws that preserve the purity of our new Katanganese state, for we must eliminate the traitors that still reside in our domain. The people of South Kasai, a small area within our land, are spineless traitors who are selfish and cowardly. Referred to as ‘bilulu’, or insects, their craven nature is what allowed the proud people of the Congo to appear weak to the colonials, and that perceived weakness was in turn exploited. We have not forgotten how the bilulu has sold all of us to the Belgian. Now that the rightful leaders are back in power in Katanga, it is time to exact our retribution. \n\n President Tshombe has signed off on numerous regulations and restraints against the bilulu. They are essentially second-class citizens in our new Katanga. Without rights to participate in government, commerce, or the military, the South Kasaians are condemned to lives of poverty and squalor while the rest of our nation strides towards the future. While many in his cabinet either support the changes or criticize their brutality, one confidant believes Tshombe hasn’t gone far enough. Godefroid Munongo, the right-hand man of the President, has requested even more power to exercise justice on the South Kasaians, but Tshombe has rejected this request, for now. Yet, behind the President’s back, Munongo has taken matters into his own hands, using a small force to terrorize and murder the South Kasaians. Upon hearing of this insubordination, Tshombe and Munongo flew into a wild argument within the Presidential Office. The once inseparable duo seem to have a wedge driven between them over this issue. Whether Tshombe will fold to Munongo’s pressure or not is yet to be seen. No matter the outcome, the new Katanga will be made off of the sweat and toil of the bilulu, as we exact our retribution on these cowards."
katanga.12.a:0 "You’re filthy, you make me sick. You crawl up toilet walls just like a roach. So what are you?"

katanga.14.t:0 "A Mission to the Garanganze"
katanga.14.d:0 "The Mwami entered the Presidential Office with his entourage with a bizarre look on his face. The two different parties who met in the room had completely contrasting appearances. Delegates from the Yeke Kingdom wore traditional garb, whereas Tshombe and his cabinet had donned the style of the West, in complete suit and tie. Whether or not one of the two leaders felt out of place was impossible to discern. While the Mwami was indeed short, his presence was nevertheless commanding, for he gave off an aura of authority that was palpable. A warm, yet reserved smile met the representative of the Garanganze as he was received by our President. After initial pleasantries were exchanged, the two men were left alone in the Office as they discussed the future of Katanga and its people. Reports indicate that the meeting went off without a hitch; laughter could be heard erupting from the conversation between the two. Tshombe and Mwami Kitanika have agreed to a cordial relationship for the foreseeable future, as both have agreed to put aside their differences. Also, they have agreed to quietly consolidate the UMHK assets that remain, in order to slowly siphon funds, equipment, and resources from the miners to benefit our people. Hopefully, this agreement can blossom into a favorable relationship for both our rules!"
katanga.14.a:0 "To the future of both our peoples, in harmony!"

katanga.15.t:0 "Copper’s Travail"
katanga.15.d:0 "Another day meant another meeting with the various peoples of Katanga for President Tshombe. Today, he hosted a guest that did not receive a hearty welcome. Edgar Sengier was eyed with suspicion as he arrived in Lubumbashi. Those who knew of him were aware of his various mining operations that sucked the beautiful land of Katanga dry, while those who were unaware of who he was still leered at him, for his pale bald head shined like the full moon on a summer night and stuck out like a sore thumb in the streets of the Katanganese capital. A tenuous conversation formed in the Presidential Office between Tshombe and Sengier, where they negotiated terms towards the future of the UMHK in Katanga. Sengier knew that while Tshombe’s rise to power is not the most beneficial of outcomes in the remnants of the Congo, it is better than a left-leaning local leader that would nationalize all of the capital that the Union has been devoting for decades. As such, an agreement was put into plan. Money received from the Union’s mining operations would be placed into the coffers of the new Katanganese state; in return, Tshombe would promise the preservation of Union capital within his domain, and all of the colonial miners and engineers would be guaranteed safety. Security details would be tasked with ensuring that Union property does not fall to bandits, partisans, or zealous natives. With this agreement, we are able to utilize the Union’s expertise in mining to allow us to tap into the resources of our beautiful land, and we are able to ensure that the colonials are looked over with a watchful eye. May this understanding allow us to prosper even further!"
katanga.15.a:0 "Guess he’s not going anywhere."

katanga.16.t:0 "Taming the Wild Geese"
katanga.16.d:0 "Strengthening the grip on Katanga has cost the President blood, coin, and iron. Wresting control from the colonials has cost enough already, and keeping it in our control is costing us dearly as well. However, these tolls of coin and iron are easily replenished with the riches hidden in our homeland. However, the men loyal to our cause and the military experience they have are priceless. Every time we lose one, all of Katanga mourns, as each loss weighs heavily on the President’s head. Without much military pedigree, it is imperative to preserve Katangan lives by bringing in experienced men. Only with sound tactics and strategy can we hope to hold on to our rule. To remedy this, President Tshombe has invited outsiders to help defend Katanga. \n\n While young, Mike Hoare has shown promise for helping our new regime. His exploits in the surrounding area are impressive for a man so green. President Tshombe has offered him and his crew a generous sum of cash in exchange for his loyalty. Under his command are both Katangan warriors and ex-pats, and Mad Mike has established 5 Commando, an elite force to deal with any dissidents or partisans to Tshombe’s rule. The most notable part of this fighting group is Force John-John, a powerful lot of shock troopers unlike anything seen in Africa. Using armored cars and European trucks, they are quick as lightning and just as deadly. With them on our side, no man will oppose us! Long live the President and long live 5 Commando!"
katanga.16.a:0 "All of our enemies will flee from the white giants!"

katanga.17.t:0 "A Neo-Colonial Paradise"
katanga.17.d:0 "Through complete cooperation with the UMHK remnants and other outliers left stranded in Katanga following the fall of Congolese colonialism, our state of Katanga has been transformed into the archetype for a new imperialist system - Neocolonialism. Describing the economic, as opposed to direct political, dominance over another nation, our Katanga has evolved into a pristine and profitable example of such a system. President Tshombe and his allies in CONAKAT and within the Mwami’s circle have come to find a new sense of cooperation and comradery with ex-colonials and mercenaries we now share our administration and our nation with, and through this cooperation, Tshombe and his allies, both old and new, have never been richer or more free to do as they please. Katanga has become their economic playground, rife to exploit for profit and prosperity. Though the UMHK remnants get more of this profit than most, President Tshombe and his cabinet of goons still get the top dollar, while the rest of the nations’ people see the benefits of this system in varying amounts. Sure, the members of the Luba and Baluba tribes and other groups within CONAKAT are well taken care of, but for those wretched souls like the Kasaian ‘bilulu,’ this system is as exploitative and unhelpful to their own needs as the old imperialist system was. \n\nKatanga has become a nation of two worlds - one world high and above the other, guided by Tshombe and his colonial ‘friends’ who reap profit and prosperity wherever they go, and another world far below, living in squalor and poverty as the upper hierarchy of Katanga simply ignores them and passes them by.

katanga.18.d:0 "Isaac Kalonji had become the face of Congolese nationalism, unity, and, worse of all, Socialism, causing untold amounts of unrest across the wider Congo, causing a headache for both our noble Katanga and the old Belgian colonials. Not only that, but this ‘national father’ was also an old friend of President Tshombe, coming from the same Luba people and once working together in CONAKAT for the betterment of the Southern Congo. However, Kalonji was also an ally of the vile bilulu, the Kasaians - our hated enemies that exist as a minority within our state. With it certain in Tshombe’s mind that Kalonji was irredeemable, our President ordered for an immediate solution to this troublesome ‘Kalonji issue.’ \n\n In the chaos of our secession in the wake of our victory over the Congolese, our forces made sure to arrest this architect of division and instability, and have held Kalonji in their custody, beating the fool and his two captured associates, Joseph Iléo and Cyrille Adoula, repeatedly and daily until the call for them to finally be executed by firing squad was made. With our allies in the UMHK and among the Mwami’s loyalists serving as witnesses, all watched with glee as these traitors to Katanga and to the Congo were put down like dogs without final rites or any last words. However, this execution was weeks ago, and since then their bodies have been buried. \n\nDespite this finality, President Tshombe grew paranoid over the following weeks, concerned that Kalonji and his grave site would become a shrine to this would-be martyr once the rest of the Congo found out what was done here. To alleviate his paranoia, the President and his aide Munonogo called for Kalonji’s body to be exhumed and moved to a new, unmarked resting place. To further throw off the scent, he ordered his mercenary allies to chop up Kalonji’s body piece by piece so that not a single organ or limb was left whole, turning the old Socialists body into a bloody pulp. Not stopping there, the meaty mass of Kalonji’s eviscerated remains were then heavily doused in as much sulphuric acid we could muster on such short notice, melting down the body into a slick of human bone and goo before the soldiers then used shovels, hammers, and other mining tools to turn the remaining bone to dust. Finally, to completely ensure Kalonji’s body would never be found and never be made into a shrine to taunt our beloved President, the pulped remains were soaked in gasoline and ignited by torch, turning what little was left of Kalonji into nothing but ash and scorch marks after the body and blood fueled fire finally died away. With this act finalized, Isaac Kaloni was entirely erased from this world, and now all that was left was to fully tarnish his reputation and his legacy so that no one will cry for the loss of this traitor!"

katanga.19.t:0 "A Job Finished"
katanga.19.d:0 "Moïse Tshombe was a good friend and a trusted confidant. He is, in part, responsible for allowing Katanga to rule itself for the first time in generations, giving us the freedom to have our government made by our fellow men. However, he was too short-sighted and too squeamish. Tshombe did not have what it took to truly rid Katanga of the people that condemn it to destitution. Luckily, a man has come to power that is able to finish the vision of our past President. Godefroid Munongo has taken the reins of our fledgling state and has already begun to make good on his promises. \n\n Regarding the South Kasaian people, Munongo was the only one in Tshombe’s cabinet who believed he did not go too far. Now, with power in his hands, the new President will chisel and shape Katanga to his image. Like a beautiful sculpture, the excess, unneeded material will be dashed away. The bilulu will not just be second-class citizens - in the future, they will not be citizens at all. Efforts are already underway to cut down the current population of South Kasaians within our borders. Villages have been burned, earth has been scorched, and people have been ‘relocated’. We have also enacted measures on the remaining South Kasaian population. Like dogs, we have ensured that the fertility rates of the bilulu that are left will plummet in the near future, and the extinction of these demented people is certain. This way, there will be more room for the chosen people of Katanga to prosper under President Munongo’s new reign."

katanga.20.t:0 "The Man Who Wanted to be King"
katanga.20.d:0 "Godefroid Munongo was many things: a Luba chief, an apt businessman, an extravagantly wealthy entrepreneur, and now the newest President of Katanga. However, for all this success and with all these accolades, one title still eluded him - Mwami. Long has Munonogo fawned over the fallen Yeke Kingdom of old, and longer still has he craved true power over all in Katanga. \n\nHis desire to be the Mwami is not entirely unfounded, for Munongo is in fact distantly related to the current ruling line of the Garanganze Kings, of whom Mwenda III now currently rules. Mwami Mwenda III, more commonly known by his personal name Kitanika Mabumba, is however a close ally to Munongo, and our President knows that to usurp this throne would lose him one of the only stable support bases he has left. To sideskirt this while still getting what he truly desires, President Munongo has declared that the modern State of Katanga is the contemporary heir to the Yeke Kingdom’s past glories. Naming Mwenda III as the true king of Katanga, Munongo has raised the Mwami up to his level of power and influence, though this move is entirely ceremonial. In reality, Munongo shall hold onto all the power like he already does, and shall use the traditions and legacy of the old Kingdom of Garanganze to forge a new, traditionally-influenced culture here in Katanga that is entirely loyal to him. By using his closeness with the current Mwami to build his legitimacy, Munongo plans to eventually usurp the title of Mwami in the future, most likely after Mwenda III passes and if Munongo can stake a claim stronger than the current heir, the Mwami’s brother. In the meantime, to build legitimacy in the eyes of the Yeke nobles and the people of Katanga, past practices such as the Yeke Trade Network shall be revived while tribalist culture is spread and championed by the government. Munongo has even called for a nation-wide return to Msiri’s original faith of the Nyamwezi peoples in an attempt to unite the Katangan people against the growing influence of colonial Christianity. Though it is a far-cry from the throne he so desires, this first step plants the foundation for Munongo’s future schemes and dreams, and now the world must watch as Katanga is transformed into a land lost in time - one foot in the past, and one foot running towards modernity."

katanga.21.t:0 "Katangan Target Practice"
katanga.21.d:0 "The wildlife in the trees and foliage fled as they heard the short crack erupted from the jungles of Katanga. Birds quickly darted from their perches to cower as Mad Mike Hoare sat in the brushes below. The merc etched another tally mark on his armored truck as smoke billowed from his rifle. Once a standard-issue truck, the madman’s truck was now covered with white chalk marks, each one signifying a life he had taken. He slowly notched another bullet into his rifle before calling to men who were down his “target range”. His fellow members of 5 Commando began to drag what would be Hoare’s next target. A bloodied native man was dragged into Hoare’s sights. All of the man’s limbs were bound, and he could barely stand without support. Gashes across his face and back were clearly visible in the hot African sun, and his labored breaths were met with apathetic laughter. Hoare and his men claimed that this man was a Simba rebel who was undermining the stability of the mercenary group’s new state. Upon hearing of possible insurrection from partisans and minority groups within Katanga, 5 Commando wasted no time. With devilish speed, they rounded up any and all who were suspected of conspiracy. Most were put to the blade, while others were saved for this moment. The two men down the range gave Mad Mike the go-ahead. The merc raised his rifle, took a deep breath, and squeezed. He propped his rifle against his truck and grabbed his piece of chalk."

katanga.22.t:0 "Scavenging Shinkolobwe"
katanga.22.d:0 "Miners from the Union Miniére began to emerge from the murky dark expanses of the Shinkolobwe mines. After the engineers from the Union and soldiers from the 5 Commando came to an agreement, they began monopolizing all of the mineral reserves of Katanga, with Sengier at the top of the food chain. The miners carried with them vast spoils: iron, copper, cobalt. Most interesting, however, was the uranium ore that was unearthed in Shinkolobwe. While Hoare was disappointed over the fact that we found no munitions or equipment hiding in the mines, he is intrigued by the prospect of uranium.  \n\n When Damocles, the top-secret project made by the godless bastards in Paris, was released to the world, uranium became ten times more valuable overnight. Every major country is racing to build the superweapon that can flatten a city with one strike. While we could sell this uranium to a rising power like Russia or one of the factions in the States and make good coin, we have other ideas in mind. Our sovereignty is fickle, and we are beset by hungry powers inside and out. It isn’t out of the question that an angry Germany could come knocking at our doors, eager to restore their mandate in Africa once again. Just as easily, the old powers of the Entente might still see the Dark Continent as their stomping grounds, not willing to share their fun with us. We must secure our home. With some excess given to the Union to sell under the table to Europe and the Americas in order to keep us afloat, we have begun to use the uranium to join the great powers of the world in this arms race. We have also announced this prospect to incredulous and skeptical reactions from around the world. Whether they believe us or not, they will not call our bluff out of fear of the repercussions, and whether we can actually make a nuclear bomb is yet to be seen. Our mercenary group are no scientists, but we are adaptable. We have begun to use the uranium as part of our munitions for artillery, and with this superweapon, we will secure our rule."

katanga.23.d:0 "The day had come. After weeks of tinkering, refining, and constructing, the Big Goose had been finished. In a project called Amach, named after an old Irish word for rebellion, we will finally test to see if we will be the torchbearers of a new age. While our mercenaries don’t have the expertise of scientists in Europe and America, we have the will. The Big Goose is, essentially, an artillery shell infused with refined uranium. We do not have the capabilities to truly make a nuclear weapon, but this is the second-best thing. Or so we thought. \n\n The artillery gun that the bomb would be fired from had to be manually launched. As one of the mercs primed the artillery piece, a cacophony of whirls and explosions pierced through the tranquility of the Katanga jungle. Upon realizing that the warhead was primed, but lodged inside of the barrel of the artillery gun, chaos broke out as everyone within the vicinity of the test scrambled away from the literal ticking bomb. Whether or not the warhead exploded or not was yet to be seen, as nobody stayed back to confirm the success of the test or lack thereof. Despite the test being a catastrophic failure, it matters not. We have more than enough money to cut our losses, and we will continue the bluff that secures the validity of our state. Our research team is gaining valuable experience, which is hard to come by in the jungles of Katanga, and hopefully, we will refine our process and create a working weapon in the future."

katanga.24.d:0 "Since President Tshombe’s rise to the peak of the Katangan hierarchy as the absolute ruler of Katanga, ethnic tensions and political infighting have been at an all time high, especially considering the highly chaotic but short history of our infantile state. The wolves have long circled the President, eyeing his position and his vast fortune like hyenas stalking a sick wildebeest, waiting for Tshombe to die so they may pick the carcass of his ruthlessly-earned successes. Despite these many vulture-like underlings, President Tshombe’s rule has still held, and most of his challenges have come from those too lowly and brash to matter. \n\nHowever, not all of Tshombe’s detractors are so powerless, or so loud spoken, for his own right-hand man and chief confidant Godefroid Munongo has secretly conspired against him for months. This backhanded conspiriting has come to its climax, for Tshombe has taken a trip to stay at his home on the coast of Lake Tanganyika with a few of his favored business associates and call-girls, presenting the perfect opportunity for Munongo to strike. \n\nWith the urgency of this opportunity in mind, Munongo has sent a strike team of expert mercenaries not associated with any local Katangan groups to the lakehouse to murder the President as he parties away on the Katangan people’s, and more importantly Munongo’s, dollar. With this secret strike team enroute to Tshombe’s position, it is only a matter of time before they relay back to Munongo whether the task was successful or not, but if it is, Munonongo would likely stand as the new interim, and likely permanent, ruler of Katanga."

According to his immediate successor Godefroid Munongo, Simba revolutionaries snuck over the border and murdered him and his posse in Tshombe’s lakeside home along the banks of Lake Tanganyika, burning his home to the ground and slaughtering every attendant at the President’s chalet. However, to some more astute members of the former-President’s cabinet, much of the evidence instead points to Munongo’s involvement in Tshombe’s death - a fact that has been quickly and thoroughly covered up by Munongo’s new regime, with all complicit parties being dealt with to ensure utmost secrecy. \n\nNow standing as the undisputed leader of Katanga and seen as the champion of Tshombe’s original ideas, Godefroid Munongo seemingly has full reign to do as he pleases - pushing Katanga further into his pocket. Under his rule, slave labor is expected to skyrocket as the needs of the state multiply to fit Munongo’s ambitions, the ethnic cleansing campaign against the South Kasaians shall be furthered, and Munongo has even begun to further his known appreciation for the monarchical legacy of Katanga, beginning to refer to himself as a new Msiri and the true Mwami. Announcing that Katanga shall be a new and modern incarnation of the Yeke Kingdom of old, Munongo seems dead set on some nebulous destiny that none of his compatriots can see. However, with these delusions of grandeur, Munongo and his UMHK allies bring profit, and that's more than enough for most of this administration to maintain their loyalty."

Chasing the false leads of the snake Munongo, Tshombe has sent attack dogs and police battaltions deep into the jungle pursuing ‘Simba assassins’ that likely do not exist, or are at least not the culprits of attempted assassination of the President. Unbeknownst to him, his ‘loyal’ ally Godefroid Munongo is the true culprit behind these recent attacks and internal divisions, and has long plotted to take Tshombe’s fortunes and his power. Though Tshombe still rules now as President, and has increasingly grown more autocratic and paranoid with these personal hitjobs, his hold on power may not be as secure as it seems, and Munongo does not seem keen on stopping to plot a way to seize the mandate to rule Katanga."

The traitorous snake Munongo has been revealed to be the true culprit behind the recent attack after the surviving assassins from the hit ratted on their paymaster. Stomaching no treachery or deceit from within his own ranks, President Tshombe has called for the immediate (show) trial of Munongo, and what is likely to follow - a swift and bloody execution. \n\nHowever, with Munongo’s death, the position of right-hand man to the President must be filled, and two main candidates stand as possible replacements. Tshombe could align more with the traditionalist elements within the nation, and with the Mwami loyalists, by declaring the current reigning Mwami as the Vice-President of Katanga. Alternatively, he could choose to favor the remaining colonial assets within Katanga and appoint Edgard Sengier - our main financier and ally in the UMHK. Finally, Tshombe could choose the dark-horse candidate to appease the military - the lifeline of our fragile state - and name the infamous ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare as the new VP. Despite his choice, this VP position is merely an advisory role, for only President Tshombe truly has any say in his Katanga."

Marching on the capital with a mass of his own loyal troops and followers behind him, the Heir of Msiri has seized power in a near-bloodless coup, for a few mercs under contract to Tshombe’s allies were killed in a brief firefight in the central square of Lubumbashi. Now fully in charge, Mwenda III has proclaimed the revival of the Yeke Kingdom, and a return of tribal monarchism to Katanga."

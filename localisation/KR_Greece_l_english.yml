GRE_memories_of_king:0 "Memories of the King"
GRE_memories_of_king_desc:0 "While Greece is still technically a monarchy, since the end of the Weltkrieg, her King has lived in exile with the Thunderbolt Regent ruling in his stead. When Kondylis first came to power, most monarchists expected him to restore King Alexander to his rightful throne. However, Kondylis refused, citing the instability of the Greek nation, saying the King returning would only make the situation worse, much to the chagrin of hardline Monarchists. To this day, hardline Monarchists and Republicans despise the Regent's government, and many are counting down the days to his death, which to them looks closer everyday..."
GRE_foreign_industry_GER1:0 "German-Owned Industry"

It is likely that the Regent-For-Life will continue ruling until his eventual death..."

POLITICS_KONDYLIS_DESC:0 "For the past ten years, Georgios "Thunderbolt" Kondylis has guided Greece as its eternal regent: a firm hand on the rudder of an often chaotic Greek state. Republican and Radical resentment hasn't been quashed so much as quieted after an abortive revolution in Thessalia, and many supporters of the King(s) wonder aloud when the "regent" will finally allow Greece's rightful rulers to return home. The fact that they're Germans should, of course, be forgotten. Yet, change is on the horizon. The thunderbolt general's health is failing. Kondylis has no clear successor, and the greats of Greek politics either live in exile or have already given up the ghost. What shall become of the Kingdom of the Hellenes?"

### Focuses ###
GRE_black_monday_focus:0 "Black Monday"
GRE_black_monday_focus_desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis has hit the Greek economy like a bull in a china shop, considering its domination by German businesses. It is time to take drastic action to resolve this crisis before it gets any worse."
GRE_farming_crisis:0 "The Farming Crisis"
GRE_farming_crisis_desc:0 "While the Greek economy saw strong industrial growth through the 19th century it remains primarily orientated on agriculture, and thus the sudden drop in agricultural exports has hit the country hard. Farmers are nearly at a point of rioting, and thus addressing the crisis tops our agenda."
GRE_foreign_industry_question:0 "Foreign-Owned Industries?"
GRE_foreign_industry_question_desc:0 "Much of Greece's industry is owned by foreigners, mainly in Germany and Austria. With the financial crisis, many of these factories have begun to shut their doors, expecting Greece to deal with the political fallout until such a time as the economy recovers. With so many industrial workers left unpaid and out on the street, we must do something about this."
GRE_board_of_industry:0 "The Board of Industry"
GRE_board_of_industry_desc:0 "A new government agency must be created in order to oversee an overhaul of some of Greece's rather outdated industrial laws and practices."

GRE_land_reform_desc:0 "Many of the country's agricultural communes are still overseen by wealthy landlords, with the peasants treated practically as serfs.

GRE_privatize_industry:0 "Privatize Government Holdings"
GRE_privatize_industry_desc:0 "There are a number of government-run businesses and factories which would best work in the hands of private individuals.

GRE_nationalize_industry:0 "Nationalize Vital Companies"
GRE_nationalize_industry_desc:0 "Too many vital industries are ready to go bankrupt. Only the nation's government is organized and efficient enough to keep them afloat, at least until the crisis is passed and, in the meantime, they can keep the economy afloat and Greeks employed."
GRE_military_conversion:0 "Convert Military Factories"
GRE_military_conversion_desc:0 "There are a number of military factories which we must consider turning over to commercial use. It means Greece will be less prepared for war in the future, but there will be no Greece if it crumbles around us thanks to the crisis."
GRE_fund_business:0 "Take Out Loans"
GRE_fund_business_desc:0 "We cannot dig any deeper - the only way to bail Greece out of this crisis is to take out as many loans as we can afford, and channel that money into employment programs and funding the most promising companies willing to open new factories in Greece. It will hurt in the long run, but we have little choice."
GRE_recovery:0 "Full Recovery"

GRE_monarchist_question:0 "The Remaining Monarchists"
GRE_monarchist_question_desc:0 "There are still many within the government, and especially the army, who yet hold loyalties to the monarchy.

GRE_king_alexandros:0 "King Aléxandros"
GRE_king_alexandros_desc:0 "First crowned in 1917 and later exiled, King Alexander shall be returned to the throne. A moderate man used to being a figurehead, he shall serve as a constitutional monarch with only the minimum of formal powers."
GRE_republican_question:0 "The Remaining Republicans"
GRE_republican_question_desc:0 "With the king now back on the throne, a question lingers regarding what should be done with those who most oppose him and advocate a return to republican rule. The king advocates mercy, but would that only leave Greece to the possibility of more coups in the future?"
GRE_empower_the_throne:0 "Empower the Throne"
GRE_empower_the_throne_desc:0 "It seems Alexander has learned a thing or two in his exile and has been exerting his will on parliament more forcefully.

GRE_king_georgios:0 "King Geórgios"

GRE_divine_mediator_desc:0 "The king stands as a divinely anointed ruler, chosen by both God and the people to defend them from radicalism and instability.

GRE_neuter_military:0 "Neuter Military"

GRE_christian_unions:0 "Found Christian Unions"

### Events
gre.1.t:0 "The Thunderbolt Regency"
gre.1.d:0 "The years since Greece's loss in the Weltkrieg have seen little but upheaval and hardship. The loss of Crete and Macedonia to the Treaty of Salonika and crippling war debts to Austria and Germany sent King Alexander fleeing into exile as the Third Republic was declared... only to result in years of failed governments and coups until Georgios Kondylis took control in 1926 and declared himself the permanent Regent of Greece; its king still in exile. Republicans, Syndicalists, and Monarchists all resent the Regent’s reign. Only the loyalty of the officer corps has kept him in power. The arch-republican, Eleftherios Venizelos, waits in self-imposed exile in Vienna. Monarchists like Panagis Tsaldaris demand a plebiscite for the return of the King. Syndicalist workers’ unions are growing increasingly militant. Yet, for the moment, Greece remains in the iron grip of the Thunderbolt General."
gre.1.a:0 "Goodness!"
gre.2.t:0 "The Challenges Ahead"
gre.2.d:0 "The new republic, which faces its next election in 1938, faces several challenges before then: most prominent is the simmering resentment towards the loss of Greek territory. Most are certain that war is coming again soon, with many groups such as the syndicalist rebels and the looming figure of Ioannis Metaxas waiting for the first moment the government makes the slightest misstep. Monarchist sentiment is also on the rise, with many demanding that another referendum be held soon to determine whether the kingdom should be restored... even if republicans fear that doing so would only plunge the nation into anarchy yet again."
gre.2.a:0 "We shall not repeat past mistakes."
gre.3.t:0 "Independence Day"
gre.3.d:0 "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire, which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news, she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."
gre.3.a:0 "A new spirit shall be born again!"
gre.4.d:0 "Independence Day is celebrated once again in [Root.GetNameDef], with crowds lining the streets in Athens and other cities, all waving the Greek flag and singing 'Ýmnos is tin Eleftherían' - the Hymn to Freedom, and the country's national anthem. Despite all the hardship the country has faced, its people are still eager to celebrate their sense of independence from those who would oppress them."
gre.4.a:0 "Hail, o hail, Liberty!"
gre.5.t:0 "Black Monday hits Greece!"
gre.5.d:0 "The rapid German economic collapse has reached our nation! Our reliance on trade with Germany and Mitteleuropean dominance of our economy has exacerbated the crisis, with many German factories being instructed to shut down. Worse, the spread of the crisis has meant a lack of markets for our agricultural exports, and already farmers are facing a crisis where almost none of them can sell their crops. We must quickly work to address this crisis, lest it grow out of hand and sow chaos throughout our nation."
gre.5.a:0 "O Theós na mas voithísei!"
gre.6.t:0 "Responding to the Crisis"
gre.6.d:0 "With the number of farmers left holding crops and nowhere to sell them, we are left with a choice: either support them for the current year and encourage them to switch away from their reliance on exports, or dig deep into our pockets and support them fully until the economic crisis has passed."
gre.6.a:0 "Help them out as much as we can."
gre.6.b:0 "Dig deep - they're the backbone of Greece."
gre.7.t:0 "Foreign-Owned Industry"
gre.7.d:0 "Almost half of our economy is owned by investors in Germany and Austria, but after Black Monday many of their mines and factories have closed down - some because they have become unprofitable but others because the investors are trying to save money or have gone bankrupt. In either case, many thousands of Greeks have been put out of work. The suggestion is that we should seize these assets, or at least the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika stipulating that we cannot. The only way to prevent a backlash from either country, however, is to subsidize the investors out of our own pocket... a deeply unpopular move if we attempted it, to be sure."
gre.7.a:0 "Seize it all, no matter the repercussions."
gre.7.b:0 "Deal with the worst cases only."
gre.7.c:0 "Subsidize the investors ourselves - they'd better be grateful."
gre.8.t:0 "Greece Seizes [Root.GetAdjective] Assets"
gre.8.d:0 "Thanks to the rippling effects of Black Monday, [Root.GetAdjective] investors who held majority shares in Greek factories and mines have been closing those businesses down - in some cases because they're unprofitable, but in others because the investors have gone bankrupt. The Greek government has responded by seizing the companies, despite the Treaty of Salonika signed after the war stipulating that our investors have unfettered access to their economy. Many in the government are suggesting we respond harshly, and not only apply sanctions but pull all investment out of [From.GetNameDef] altogether. Others say the country is only trying to stay afloat - Black Monday has hit all of us hard."
gre.8.a:0 "Apply sanctions and pull all business out at once."
gre.8.b:0 "Just apply the sanctions and express our outrage."
gre.8.c:0 "Leave them be - we're all trying to cope."
gre.9.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Applies Harsh Sanctions"
gre.9.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has applied a range of economic sanctions in response to our contravention of the Treaty of Salonika - including pulling all assets out of the country, including those which were still operational - but thankfully has gone no further. The move will sting for a few years, to be sure, and has seriously soured relations between our countries."
gre.9.a:0 "It had to be done."
gre.10.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Applies Sanctions"
gre.10.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has applied a range of economic sanctions in response to our contravention of the Treaty of Salonika, but thankfully has gone no further. The move will sting for a few years, to be sure, and has soured relations between our countries."
gre.11.t:0 "Greece Seizes [Root.GetAdjective] Assets"

The Greek government has responded by seizing many of the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika signed after the war stipulating that our investors have unfettered access to their economy. Many in the government are suggesting we respond with sanctions, while others say the Greeks are simply doing what they have to in order to survive - they could, after all, have seized all investor assets if they'd wished, and not simply some."
gre.11.a:0 "Apply sanctions - they must be taught a lesson."
gre.12.t:0 "Monarchists Demand Referendum"
gre.12.d:0 "Several prominent aristocrats, led by the influential former general Ioannis Metaxas, today stormed Parliament and demanded the government begin a referendum on the future of the monarchy. They say the question must be settled once and for all, and the government has put it off for too long. Their position has gained considerable support among the people, as well."
gre.12.a:0 "Perhaps we should consider it?"
gre.13.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the [Root.GetFactionName]"
gre.13.d:0 "Evidently, the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided it has gotten all it required from their alliance with us, and have informed us that they are leaving the [Root.GetFactionName] effective immediately."

gre.14.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks to Join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
gre.14.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] has sent a formal request, asking to be admitted into the [Root.GetFactionName]. Are they worth the possibility we might also get dragged into their struggles?"

gre.14.b:0 "They're more trouble than they're worth."
gre.15.t:0 "We are Part of the [From.GetFactionName]"
gre.15.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to admit us into their alliance. We are now officially part of the [From.GetFactionName]."
gre.15.a:0 "Excellent."
gre.16.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
gre.16.d:0 "Perhaps deciding we're more trouble than we're worth, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to admit us into the [From.GetFactionName]."
gre.16.a:0 "Ah well."
gre.17.t:0 "Massive Demonstrations Against the Government"
gre.17.d:0 "The country's loss in the war has triggered demonstrations across [Root.GetNameDef], all calling for the government to step down immediately. Indeed, it is apparent that forces are beginning to array themselves to take control of the country by force if the government does not step down, and the fear is that the country is on the verge of civil war."
gre.17.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
gre.18.t:0 "The Government Nears Collapse"
gre.18.d:0 "Demonstrations have continued against the government, with the situation having finally reached a critical mass. If the government doesn't step down immediately, radical elements could take control, or the country could completely dissolve into chaos."

He has been succeeded by Alexandros Koryzis, his chosen successor, though many fear Koryzis cannto hope to match Metaxas's personal magnetism and military record. While Metaxas was considered a controversial figure by many, people still lined the streets throughout the country to mourn the man's death."
gre.19.d.nothos:0 "Former general Ioannis Metaxas, a war hero and politician renowned for his strong beliefs, died today of a phlegmon of the pharynx. While Metaxas was considered a controversial figure by many, people still lined the streets throughout the country to mourn the man's death."

gre.21.d.ishos:0 "Kostas Gavriilides, long-time leader of the radical Rural Democratic Front and president of [Root.GetNameDef], today stepped down from his position to retire. After a debate within the party, leadership has been passed to Gavriilides's chosen successor, Nikos Ploumpidis."

gre.22.t:0 "The Papandreou Scandal"
gre.22.d:0 "A number of government ministers have been caught up in a corruption scandal, revealed by the press, but the nation was shocked today to learn that Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou also stands accused. While it seems there is insufficient evidence for formal charges to be laid, the scandal has been enough for the New Liberal Coalition to consider whether Papandreou should continue as the party leader."
gre.22.a:0 "Panagiotis Kanellopoulos wrests control of the party."

gre.101.b:0 "We must suppress this nonsense."
gre.102.t:0 "The Republican Campaign"
gre.102.d:0 "There are a number of advisers in the government growing nervous at the prospect of a monarchist victory. They are suggesting we should consider funding a campaign of our own, in favour of republicanism - quietly, of course, so not to draw undue suspicion that we are exerting too much influence on the results. This is, however, exactly what they want."

There are fears that Zachariadis might do more than stir up republican support, however, and also gain plenty of support for his own revolutionary ideas."

gre.105.t:0 "Monarchist Riot"

Where does it belong in the international socialist community? How will its economy be restructured? What is to be done about the remaining republicans and monarchists who will surely struggle against the new order? In the end, the congress turned into a struggle between two men: the acting chairman, Nikos Zachariadis, and the charismatic general, Aris Velouchiotis. Velouchiotis's vision for Greece is much less forgiving, and far more geared towards turning the country into a military power, while Zachariadis argues that path will destroy Greece in the end."

Others say that a more diplomatic tactic is needed: work with the capitalists and convince them the communes will benefit them, and use incentives to win them over. Still others say it is the unions who should lead the way - bring them more directly into the government, and prove to the country that the communes are a government by the worker."

This would mean an end to hostilities with the Greeks, and a sorting out of our differences. What the Greeks are asking for is this: we give them any states integral to their country, and they give us ours, while each of us give up any claims to other territories. We also begin an exchange of population, with Turks in [GRE.GetNameDef] coming to [Root.GetNameDef] but our much greater number of Greeks leaving for their country. In exchange, they will sign a pact of non-aggression, and we will do the same.

In the heart of Constantinople the newly crowned emperor passed through cheering crowds, dressed in regal purple attire he made his way to the marble towers of the Hagia Sophia. Once inside the Holy Communion was performed with Senators and patricians offering their prostrations. The Patriarch read a set of lengthy prayers before presenting the emperor with the mantle and crown. Placing the crown upon his head the Patriarch then performed the Sign of the Cross on his forehead, and with this the Byzantine Emperor had been blessed. He then left the Hagia Sophia, immediately being flocked by crowds crying ‘Holy, holy!’"

gre.301.t:0 "The Rebirth of a Nation"
gre.301.d:0 "Modern liberal democracy has failed Greece, the ideals of the democratic system have been manipulated and twisted into a degenerated society of corruption. In order for Greece to be saved from itself a new state must be born, one that harkens back to the traditions of the Ancient Hellenics. A nation for Greeks to wholly commit themselves to, with the same determination and discipline that the Spartans had. A nation that follows in the footsteps of Pericles, who’s Athenean regime evolved into the ‘First Greek Civilization’. A nation that honours the legacy of our forebears who brought greatness and pride to all of Europe and the greater world, a people who are worthy enough to proclaim lineage to Alexander the Great. Greece will become the eternal flame of the Balkans, a beauty never to be extinguished. Through these trying times it is the Greek ecclesiastic hierarchy who will take on leadership of the Orthodox Church, whilst our neighbours collapse we shall strive forward. It is time for a national rebirth..."
gre.301.a:0 "Chairetíste to néo krátos!"
gre.302.t:0 "The Conquering of Constantinople!"
gre.302.d:0 "Ever since the Fall of Constantinople, the vile Turkish menace have occupied our majestic capital! Despite the centuries of occupation, heavy defences and might of the Ottoman Empire they could not defend themselves against the overwhelming dedication of our troops, determined to fight until the death if it meant securing the city. With the Ottoman forces now fleeing we will move our government from Athens and establish Constantinople as the new capital of Greece, this is just the beginning for the planned resurrection of the Byzantine Empire!"
gre.302.a:0 "It has always belonged to us!"
gre.303.t:0 "Striking Our Mortal Enemies"
gre.303.d:0 "Since the dawn of Hellenic civilisation, our people have been under threat from the eastern hordes. Whether it be the gigantic Achaemenid Empire or rapidly expanding Ottomans, the struggle for independence has defined our history. Today marks the dawn of vengeance, well shall avenge our ancestors who defended the walls of Constaninople, who fought for Greek independence and who battled the Turks once more during the Weltkrieg. The valiant heroes of the past did not die in vain, their legacy will continue through our armies who already are marching towards the Ottoman front lines!"
gre.303.a:0 "Onwards to victory!"
gre.304.t:0 "Warrior Culture"
gre.304.d:0 "Greece’s history has been built upon warfare, the fractious nature of Ancient Greek society forged a people who lived life through battle. With the rise of ancient military powers such as the Spartans, came the development of new styles of warfare: the hoplite phalanx being one example. This innovation of military tactics and formations defined the Greek warriors. The Ancient Macedonian Army under King Philip was composed of supremely defensive formations that allowed for his armies to dominate the battleground. It is from this innovation that we will seek to develop a superior fighting force that can defend our borders from our enemies who surround us.\n\nOur military strategic experts have been researching extensively into historical Greek military tactics, and from this they have devised two plans. Both plans take inspiration from both Ancient Greece and Byzantium. The first idea is the 'Neo-Nicean Army'. We simply do not have the vast resources at our disposal like the Byzantine Empire of old. Like the Empire of Nicaea, we are cornered, but we will not fall like our ancestors! We will make the most of our situation, employing a smaller, yet highly disciplined force to outwit our enemies on the battlefield. The other plan is the ‘New Komnenian Army’, as the name suggests, the military would adopt tactics used during the Komnenian era, which includes the pronoia system. This system grants fiscal rights and lands to loyal individuals who serve the Empire with all of their being, ensuring a loyal and steady supply of men. The Komnenian army also employed numerous skilled mercenary companies to fill the gaps that a native army was insufficient at, and we shall do the same. The only drawback the latter plan has is grave, though; we lack a strong economic base after Black Monday, and such a great investment into the army may spell doom and bankruptcy for our state. Which plan shall we choose?"
gre.304.a:0 "...the New Komnenian Army"
gre.304.b:0 "...the Neo-Nicean Army"
gre.305.t:0 "The Founding of the New Byzantine Empire!"
gre.305.d:0 "Under the blessings of the Patriarch, the purple phoenix has risen from the ashes. The Byzantine flag has been raised over Constantinople for the first time since Emperor Constantine XI fell, defending his decimated empire from the Turkish invaders. The Weltkrieg left Greece devastated, however under our glorious leadership the Hellenic people are united and have expanded beyond their borders to reclaim what is rightfully theirs!"
gre.305.a:0 "For the Emperor!"
gre.308.t:0 "The Fall of Rome"
gre.308.d:0 "After a period of intensive fighting throughout the streets of Rome, the ancient city is now under Byzantine control once more. Just like the Gothic War, when Byzantine forces reclaimed the former capital of the Roman Empire from the barbarians, we have restored true Roman order to these lands. The Double-Headed Eagle banner has been placed above the Vatican and the Pope has been forced out and replaced with a true Patriarch of the Othordox Catholic Church. Although the city is still unstable and susceptible to an invasion from the forces in the north of Italy it has been agreed by the Byzantine Senate that Rome should be declared the ceremonial capital of the Empire. For logistical reasons all governing will still take place in Constantinople for the time being."
gre.308.a:0 "Veni, vidi, vici."
gre.309.t:0 "Third Hellenic Civilization"
gre.309.d:0 "The republican era of Greece has been a scourge on the youth, lack of central authority and enforced morality has produced weak children. Children who are not fit to inherit the Greek state, therefore we have established the National Youth Organisation (Ethnikí Orgánosis Neoléas). This will instill the same sense of loyalty and duty that Spartan youth possesed, the youth of the nation will swear an oath to defend Greece at all costs. The activities of the EON include athletic events, parades, marches and military training, this will cultivate their national values and cooperational spirit. The goal of the EON is to build a generation of youth who will establish the ‘Third Hellenic Civilisation’, one that maintains the aesthetics of Ancient Greece and Byzantine whilst prepared to face the modern world..."
gre.309.a:0 "One nation, one king, one leader, one youth!"
gre.310.t:0 "Caesaropapism"
gre.310.d:0 "From the 330 consecration of Constantiople through to the tenth century, the Emperors of Byzantine held great authority over the Church and religious affairs. This power was fit only for a divine monarch whose authority and rule was blessed by God, many centuries have passed since a leader of Greece could claim such holy blessings that would justify authority over the Church. That is until now, our Archigos has rebuilt Greece under the faith of Orhtodox Christianity. It is this dedication to faith that has allowed Greece to enter into a period of prosperity. Furthermore Ecumenical councils have been established to aid in the settlement of religious matters. The moral degradation and sins of republicanism, liberalism and syndicalism will never conquer the spirit of Greece!"
gre.310.a:0 "Deus Vult!"

gre.264.t:0 "Georgios Kondylis Dead!"
gre.264.d:0 "Regent-for-life and prominent general, Georgios Kondylis, nicknamed ‘Keravnos’ or ‘Thunderbolt’, has sadly passed away due to a heart attack. The fierce military commander had a long history serving in the military, serving in the Crete expedition, Macedonian Struggle and as captain during the Balkan Wars. Beloved by many as a national hero, his reputation throughout the Weltkrieg was enough to strike fear into the hearts of Greece’s enemies. During the choas of post-Weltkrieg Greece he took power and offered stability to his people.\n\nWith no apparent heir, Prime Minister Papandreou, in agreement with the republican parties that have a large legislative majority, proclaimed the Greek Republic, becoming interim president and appointing Panagiotis Kanellopoulos as Prime Minister. Depsite proclaiming a Republic, Papandreou has made it clear he intends to hold a long-promised referendum on the Status of the Greek Monarchy, at the earliest convenience."
gre.264.a:0 "The nation mourns..."

gre.313.t:0 "The Socialist Populist Coalition"
gre.313.d:0 "Troubling news comes from our informants who are affiliated with left leaning Greek political parties! It seems that the conniving Nikos Zachariadis has, with a menagerie of rhetoric, manipulation, and blackmail, united most of the Greek left into a new coalition: the Socialist Populist Coalition. A united left will surely spell trouble for us, as we can already hear their voices reach the people about our army committing heinous acts against our conquered foe in the name of Byzantium! In a surprising twist of events, Zachariadis has claimed that we have not fulfilled the true Byzantium, as it was an Empire of many peoples. He goes further into lunacy, calling Byzantium 'the first true socialist nation', citing the revolts of many populist leaders of the time, including Basil the Copper Hand, a revolutionary who lead a revolt of peasants a milennium ago. While we expected the people to disregard this lunacy, it appears quite the opposite: the left coalition is growing stronger and stronger each day."
gre.313.a:0 "This is concerning."

gre.314.t:0 "On the Status of Greek Primacy"
gre.314.d:0 "The talk around Greece is the decision of the Prime Ministership, with the key issue lying with non-Greek minorities. With our armies ever successful, we have come to control large swathes of land that once belonged to us. However, over the centuries, Greeks have become a minority in these lands, vastly outnumbered by Arabs and Turks who are less than friendly to our rule to say the least. While we could easily drown out these heretics after years of Greek settlement and through eroding minority freedoms, this would likely cause a wave of violent backlash. Alternatively, we can take a pluralist direction, and work with these minorities to build a multi-ethnic and egalitarian new Byzantium, for it is with practices like these that the original Byzantine Empire lasted so long. What should we do?"
gre.314.a:0 "These new lands shall be Greek and Greek alone!"

gre.315.t:0 "The Greek Exodus"
gre.315.d:0 "Finally putting our plan into action, Greeks have begun to leave the homeland in droves, moving in massive convoys to settle in Constantinople and Anatolia once more. Though this has created some tension, we have a handle on the situation now, and we are confident we can put down any trouble should it arise. These old lands of the fallen empire shall now be Greek once more as the might of our people and culture spreads out from Greece once again."
gre.315.a:0 "We shall be the King of Kings ruling over all other rulers once again!"

gre.316.t:0 "The Anatolian Riots"
gre.316.d:0 "In a reaction to our nationalist pro-Greek agenda, the Turks and other minorities of Anatolia have begun to violently riot against our policies. Greek settlers are under attack all across this new region, and blood has already been spilled. We must declare an official stance to these riots and fast, lest they spread further across the Empire."
gre.316.a:0 "They will come to their senses in time. Let the riots die out themselves."
gre.316.b:0 "They shall learn our peaceful ways by force!"

gre.317.t:0 "The Reds Strike!"
gre.317.d:0 "Disaster! Our police failed to quell the riots around Anatolia! In fact, by resorting to violence, the Socialist Populist Coalition has completely turned this problem on our heads. The riots have swollen to breaking out throughout the country, as Greek and Turk join hand in hand in protesting our unfair rule and treatment. Nikos Zachariadis himself has lead a march to Constantinople to depose our rule! With the people against us, and even the most staunch nationalists having no desire to spill Greek blood, it appears all we can do is watch as the Socialist Populist Coalition seizes power in Byzantium."
gre.317.a:0 "No! That's not how this is supposed to go!"

GRE_memories_of_king:0 "Memories of the King"
GRE_memories_of_king_desc:0 "While Greece is still technically a monarchy, since the end of the Weltkrieg, her King has lived in exile with the Thunderbolt Regent ruling in his stead. When Kondylis first came to power, most monarchists expected him to restore King Alexander to his rightful throne. However, Kondylis refused, citing the instability of the Greek nation, saying the King returning would only make the situation worse, much to the chagrin of hardline Monarchists. To this day, hardline Monarchists and Republicans despise the Regent's government, and many are counting down the days to his death, which to them looks closer everyday..."

It is likely that the Regent-For-Life will continue ruling until his eventual death..."

POLITICS_KONDYLIS_DESC:0 "For the past ten years, Georgios "Thunderbolt" Kondylis has guided Greece as its eternal regent: a firm hand on the rudder of an often chaotic Greek state. Republican and Radical resentment hasn't been quashed so much as quieted after an abortive revolution in Thessalia, and many supporters of the King(s) wonder aloud when the "regent" will finally allow Greece's rightful rulers to return home. The fact that they're Germans should, of course, be forgotten. Yet, change is on the horizon. The thunderbolt general's health is failing. Kondylis has no clear successor, and the greats of Greek politics either live in exile or have already given up the ghost. What shall become of the Kingdom of the Hellenes?"

### Focuses ###
GRE_black_monday_focus:0 "Black Monday"
GRE_black_monday_focus_desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis has hit the Greek economy like a bull in a china shop, considering its domination by German businesses. It is time to take drastic action to resolve this crisis before it gets any worse."
GRE_farming_crisis:0 "The Farming Crisis"
GRE_farming_crisis_desc:0 "While the Greek economy saw strong industrial growth through the 19th century it remains primarily orientated on agriculture, and thus the sudden drop in agricultural exports has hit the country hard. Farmers are nearly at a point of rioting, and thus addressing the crisis tops our agenda."
GRE_foreign_industry_question:0 "Foreign-Owned Industries?"
GRE_foreign_industry_question_desc:0 "Much of Greece's industry is owned by foreigners, mainly in Germany and Austria. With the financial crisis, many of these factories have begun to shut their doors, expecting Greece to deal with the political fallout until such a time as the economy recovers. With so many industrial workers left unpaid and out on the street, we must do something about this."
GRE_board_of_industry:0 "The Board of Industry"
GRE_board_of_industry_desc:0 "A new government agency must be created in order to oversee an overhaul of some of Greece's rather outdated industrial laws and practices."
GRE_greek_mining:0 "Advancements in Mining"

GRE_land_reform_desc:0 "Many of the country's agricultural communes are still overseen by wealthy landlords, with the peasants treated practically as serfs.

GRE_privatize_industry:0 "Privatize Government Holdings"
GRE_privatize_industry_desc:0 "There are a number of government-run businesses and factories which would best work in the hands of private individuals.

GRE_nationalize_industry:0 "Nationalize Vital Companies"
GRE_nationalize_industry_desc:0 "Too many vital industries are ready to go bankrupt. Only the nation's government is organized and efficient enough to keep them afloat, at least until the crisis is passed and, in the meantime, they can keep the economy afloat and Greeks employed."
GRE_military_conversion:0 "Convert Military Factories"
GRE_military_conversion_desc:0 "There are a number of military factories which we must consider turning over to commercial use. It means Greece will be less prepared for war in the future, but there will be no Greece if it crumbles around us thanks to the crisis."
GRE_fund_business:0 "Take Out Loans"
GRE_fund_business_desc:0 "We cannot dig any deeper - the only way to bail Greece out of this crisis is to take out as many loans as we can afford, and channel that money into employment programs and funding the most promising companies willing to open new factories in Greece. It will hurt in the long run, but we have little choice."
GRE_recovery:0 "Full Recovery"
GRE_recovery_desc:0 "Our stimulus programs have begun to improve the economic prospects of the country for now, and the crisis is passed. Hopefully, the price we paid does not come back to haunt us."

GRE_strengthen_republic:0 "Strengthen the Republic"

GRE_monarchist_question:0 "The Remaining Monarchists"
GRE_monarchist_question_desc:0 "There are still many within the government, and especially the army, who yet hold loyalties to the monarchy.

GRE_monarchist_victory_desc:0 "The kingdom shall be restored! Today the debate was settled, though now talk has turned to which king it should be: the younger Alexander, who was king before his exile, or the older George, who should have been king before Alexander and only was not due to being exiled with his father years before."
GRE_king_alexandros:0 "King Aléxandros"
GRE_king_alexandros_desc:0 "First crowned in 1917 and later exiled, King Alexander shall be returned to the throne. A moderate man used to being a figurehead, he shall serve as a constitutional monarch with only the minimum of formal powers."
GRE_republican_question:0 "The Remaining Republicans"
GRE_republican_question_desc:0 "With the king now back on the throne, a question lingers regarding what should be done with those who most oppose him and advocate a return to republican rule. The king advocates mercy, but would that only leave Greece to the possibility of more coups in the future?"
GRE_empower_the_throne:0 "Empower the Throne"
GRE_empower_the_throne_desc:0 "It seems Alexander has learned a thing or two in his exile and has been exerting his will on parliament more forcefully. He has garnered enough support to gain power enough to overrule the elected leaders when needed, making him far from the figurehead many assumed he would be."
GRE_king_georgios:0 "King Geórgios"
GRE_king_georgios_desc:0 "A military man from an early age, Prince George is the eldest son of the late King Constantine and shall create a strong monarchy along German lines, where the King serves as a brake on the powers of parliament."

GRE_guide_parliament:0 "Guide Parliament"
GRE_guide_parliament_desc:0 "We must support the great Greek tradition of democracy, but like Plato's Philosopher King the monarch must always be there to guide the nation towards a more perfect and peaceful society. By granting the monarch significant royal prerogatives to dissolve parliament as he wishes we can ensure that it is always well lead."
#GRE_divine_mediator:0 "A Divine Mediator" already defined above as an idea
GRE_divine_mediator_desc:0 "The king stands as a divinely anointed ruler, chosen by both God and the people to defend them from radicalism and instability.

GRE_education_programs:0 "Educational Programs"
GRE_education_programs_desc:0 "Improving the literacy rate of the Greek population is of paramount importance, as is broadening the quality of education in general. We intend to found hundreds of new schools for this purpose, where the keen minds of new generations will thrive."
GRE_neuter_military:0 "Neuter Military"
GRE_neuter_military_desc:0 "By far the biggest threat to stability in Greece comes from the military, while we accept the need for the armed forces we must take steps to ensure their political neutrality and remove overly ambitious demagogues from the ranks."
GRE_strong_and_free:0 "Strong and Free"
GRE_strong_and_free_desc:0 "It may not always be wise to give power to the military, lest they abuse it, but without our army's strength we will never truly be independent. We must empower them and keep Greece both strong and free."

GRE_christian_unions:0 "Found Christian Unions"
GRE_christian_unions_desc:0 "Founding state-endorsed unions under the leadership of priests will allow us to prevent labour disputes from getting out of hand and becoming a threat to the safety of Greece.

GRE_export_focus:0 "Export-Oriented Economy"
GRE_export_focus_desc:0 "The Greek economy would be best served with a focus on exports, allowing cash to flow into the country and further develop her industries. To this end, we intend to raise industrial tariffs while seeking free trade arrangements for our agricultural produce."
GRE_auth_dems:0 "Néo Krátos"
GRE_auth_dems_desc:0 "The authoritarian, but still republican, New State have taken the lion's share of the influence in the new parliament. Fiercely anti-union and protectionist, their rule promises to take a firm hand to radicals if nothing else."

GRE_reverse_secularisation:0 "Reverse Secularisation"

### Events
gre.1.t:0 "The Thunderbolt Regency"
gre.1.d:0 "The years since Greece's loss in the Weltkrieg have seen little but upheaval and hardship. The loss of Crete and Macedonia to the Treaty of Salonika and crippling war debts to Austria and Germany sent King Alexander fleeing into exile as the Third Republic was declared... only to result in years of failed governments and coups until Georgios Kondylis took control in 1926 and declared himself the permanent Regent of Greece; its king still in exile. Republicans, Syndicalists, and Monarchists all resent the Regent’s reign. Only the loyalty of the officer corps has kept him in power. The arch-republican, Eleftherios Venizelos, waits in self-imposed exile in Vienna. Monarchists like Panagis Tsaldaris demand a plebiscite for the return of the King. Syndicalist workers’ unions are growing increasingly militant. Yet, for the moment, Greece remains in the iron grip of the Thunderbolt General."
gre.1.a:0 "Goodness!"
gre.2.t:0 "The Challenges Ahead"
gre.2.d:0 "The new republic, which faces its next election in 1938, faces several challenges before then: most prominent is the simmering resentment towards the loss of Greek territory. Most are certain that war is coming again soon, with many groups such as the syndicalist rebels and the looming figure of Ioannis Metaxas waiting for the first moment the government makes the slightest misstep. Monarchist sentiment is also on the rise, with many demanding that another referendum be held soon to determine whether the kingdom should be restored... even if republicans fear that doing so would only plunge the nation into anarchy yet again."
gre.2.a:0 "We shall not repeat past mistakes."
gre.3.t:0 "Independence Day"
gre.3.d:0 "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire, which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news, she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."
gre.3.a:0 "A new spirit shall be born again!"
gre.4.d:0 "Independence Day is celebrated once again in [Root.GetNameDef], with crowds lining the streets in Athens and other cities, all waving the Greek flag and singing 'Ýmnos is tin Eleftherían' - the Hymn to Freedom, and the country's national anthem. Despite all the hardship the country has faced, its people are still eager to celebrate their sense of independence from those who would oppress them."
gre.4.a:0 "Hail, o hail, Liberty!"
gre.5.t:0 "Black Monday hits Greece!"
gre.5.d:0 "The rapid German economic collapse has reached our nation! Our reliance on trade with Germany and Mitteleuropean dominance of our economy has exacerbated the crisis, with many German factories being instructed to shut down. Worse, the spread of the crisis has meant a lack of markets for our agricultural exports, and already farmers are facing a crisis where almost none of them can sell their crops. We must quickly work to address this crisis, lest it grow out of hand and sow chaos throughout our nation."
gre.5.a:0 "O Theós na mas voithísei!"
gre.6.t:0 "Responding to the Crisis"
gre.6.d:0 "With the number of farmers left holding crops and nowhere to sell them, we are left with a choice: either support them for the current year and encourage them to switch away from their reliance on exports, or dig deep into our pockets and support them fully until the economic crisis has passed."
gre.6.a:0 "Help them out as much as we can."
gre.6.b:0 "Dig deep - they're the backbone of Greece."
gre.7.t:0 "Foreign-Owned Industry"
gre.7.d:0 "Almost half of our economy is owned by investors in Germany and Austria, but after Black Monday many of their mines and factories have closed down - some because they have become unprofitable but others because the investors are trying to save money or have gone bankrupt. In either case, many thousands of Greeks have been put out of work. The suggestion is that we should seize these assets, or at least the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika stipulating that we cannot. The only way to prevent a backlash from either country, however, is to subsidize the investors out of our own pocket... a deeply unpopular move if we attempted it, to be sure."
gre.7.a:0 "Seize it all, no matter the repercussions."
gre.7.b:0 "Deal with the worst cases only."
gre.7.c:0 "Subsidize the investors ourselves - they'd better be grateful."
gre.8.t:0 "Greece Seizes [Root.GetAdjective] Assets"
gre.8.d:0 "Thanks to the rippling effects of Black Monday, [Root.GetAdjective] investors who held majority shares in Greek factories and mines have been closing those businesses down - in some cases because they're unprofitable, but in others because the investors have gone bankrupt. The Greek government has responded by seizing the companies, despite the Treaty of Salonika signed after the war stipulating that our investors have unfettered access to their economy. Many in the government are suggesting we respond harshly, and not only apply sanctions but pull all investment out of [From.GetNameDef] altogether. Others say the country is only trying to stay afloat - Black Monday has hit all of us hard."
gre.8.a:0 "Apply sanctions and pull all business out at once."
gre.8.b:0 "Just apply the sanctions and express our outrage."
gre.8.c:0 "Leave them be - we're all trying to cope."
gre.9.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Applies Harsh Sanctions"
gre.9.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has applied a range of economic sanctions in response to our contravention of the Treaty of Salonika - including pulling all assets out of the country, including those which were still operational - but thankfully has gone no further. The move will sting for a few years, to be sure, and has seriously soured relations between our countries."
gre.9.a:0 "It had to be done."
gre.10.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Applies Sanctions"
gre.10.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has applied a range of economic sanctions in response to our contravention of the Treaty of Salonika, but thankfully has gone no further. The move will sting for a few years, to be sure, and has soured relations between our countries."

The Greek government has responded by seizing many of the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika signed after the war stipulating that our investors have unfettered access to their economy. Many in the government are suggesting we respond with sanctions, while others say the Greeks are simply doing what they have to in order to survive - they could, after all, have seized all investor assets if they'd wished, and not simply some."
gre.11.a:0 "Apply sanctions - they must be taught a lesson."
gre.12.t:0 "Monarchists Demand Referendum"
gre.12.d:0 "Several prominent aristocrats, led by the influential former general Ioannis Metaxas, today stormed Parliament and demanded the government begin a referendum on the future of the monarchy. They say the question must be settled once and for all, and the government has put it off for too long. Their position has gained considerable support among the people, as well."
gre.12.a:0 "Perhaps we should consider it?"
gre.13.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the [Root.GetFactionName]"
gre.13.d:0 "Evidently, the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided it has gotten all it required from their alliance with us, and have informed us that they are leaving the [Root.GetFactionName] effective immediately."
gre.13.a:0 "It was fun while it lasted."
gre.14.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks to Join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
gre.14.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] has sent a formal request, asking to be admitted into the [Root.GetFactionName]. Are they worth the possibility we might also get dragged into their struggles?"
gre.14.a:0 "Of course!"
gre.14.b:0 "They're more trouble than they're worth."
gre.15.t:0 "We are Part of the [From.GetFactionName]"

gre.16.d:0 "Perhaps deciding we're more trouble than we're worth, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to admit us into the [From.GetFactionName]."
gre.16.a:0 "Ah well."
gre.17.t:0 "Massive Demonstrations Against the Government"
gre.17.d:0 "The country's loss in the war has triggered demonstrations across [Root.GetNameDef], all calling for the government to step down immediately. Indeed, it is apparent that forces are beginning to array themselves to take control of the country by force if the government does not step down, and the fear is that the country is on the verge of civil war."
gre.17.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
gre.18.t:0 "The Government Nears Collapse"
gre.18.d:0 "Demonstrations have continued against the government, with the situation having finally reached a critical mass. If the government doesn't step down immediately, radical elements could take control, or the country could completely dissolve into chaos."

He has been succeeded by Alexandros Koryzis, his chosen successor, though many fear Koryzis cannto hope to match Metaxas's personal magnetism and military record. While Metaxas was considered a controversial figure by many, people still lined the streets throughout the country to mourn the man's death."
gre.19.d.nothos:0 "Former general Ioannis Metaxas, a war hero and politician renowned for his strong beliefs, died today of a phlegmon of the pharynx. While Metaxas was considered a controversial figure by many, people still lined the streets throughout the country to mourn the man's death."

gre.20.a:0 "A fine man."
gre.21.t:0 "Kostas Gavriilides Steps Down"
gre.21.d.ishos:0 "Kostas Gavriilides, long-time leader of the radical Rural Democratic Front and president of [Root.GetNameDef], today stepped down from his position to retire. After a debate within the party, leadership has been passed to Gavriilides's chosen successor, Nikos Ploumpidis."

gre.21.a:0 "OK."
gre.22.t:0 "The Papandreou Scandal"
gre.22.d:0 "A number of government ministers have been caught up in a corruption scandal, revealed by the press, but the nation was shocked today to learn that Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou also stands accused. While it seems there is insufficient evidence for formal charges to be laid, the scandal has been enough for the New Liberal Coalition to consider whether Papandreou should continue as the party leader."
gre.22.a:0 "Panagiotis Kanellopoulos wrests control of the party."
gre.22.b:0 "Papandreou holds onto leadership after a narrow vote."
gre.23.t:0 "The Death of Themistoklis Soufilis"
gre.23.d.ishos:0 "Prime Minister Themistoklis Soufilis died today, his health having suffered since taking power in the last election.

Already lines have been drawn, with the pro-republicans and the pro-monarchists attempting to convince anyone and everyone of how to vote. It will be a difficult couple of months until the vote is actually held, and expectations are high that it will not be a peaceful time for Greece."
gre.100.a:0 "Let's hope there's no trouble..."
gre.101.t:0 "Monarchists in the Streets"
gre.101.d:0 "The pro-monarchist forces are busily campaigning in the streets of Athens and other Greek cities, handing out pamphlets which suggest the government has not done its job and is in need of a king to watch over us. They are gaining considerable traction, and some are suggesting that we should make efforts to shut them down before their actions grow out of hand."
gre.101.a:0 "Allow them to distribute their pamphlets."
gre.101.b:0 "We must suppress this nonsense."
gre.102.t:0 "The Republican Campaign"
gre.102.d:0 "There are a number of advisers in the government growing nervous at the prospect of a monarchist victory. They are suggesting we should consider funding a campaign of our own, in favour of republicanism - quietly, of course, so not to draw undue suspicion that we are exerting too much influence on the results. This is, however, exactly what they want."
gre.102.a:0 "Yes, we should fund this effort."
gre.102.b:0 "No, we should not get involved."

gre.103.t:0 "Aristocratic Lobbying"
gre.103.d:0 "Reports have it that a large number of wealthy Greek aristocrats are busily buying up influence within the government, what they call 'lobbying'... and, it's said, with the assistance of the influential Ioannis Metaxas, who himself has weighed heavily in favour of the monarchy's restoration. If we allow this influence-peddling to continue, the monarchists will definitely gain an advantage in the upcoming referendum."
gre.103.a:0 "We'll allow it."
gre.103.b:0 "Place a moratorium on this 'lobbying'"
gre.104.t:0 "The Syndicalist Rally"
gre.104.d:0 "Small rallies have been held throughout the north by the syndicalists, with a huge rally apparently planned for tomorrow in the city of Athens - with the charismatic Nikos Zachariadis, leader of the Kinonikó Ergatikó Kómma, said to be preparing a fiery speech against the monarchy and all it stands for. There are fears that Zachariadis might do more than stir up republican support, however, and also gain plenty of support for his own revolutionary ideas."
gre.104.a:0 "Allow the rally to proceed."
gre.104.b:0 "Send in the police to break it up, by force if necessary."
gre.105.t:0 "Monarchist Riot"
gre.105.d:0 "Rioting has broken out in Athens after fears by monarchist supporters that they will lose the upcoming referendum were followed by accusations that our government was attempting to rig it.

gre.107.t:0 "Monarchists Have the Advantage"
gre.107.d:0 "The sentiment within Greece in the lead up to the referendum appears to be favouring the monarchists. Some are suggesting that, if the government were to intervene and rig the referendum, now would be the time to begin. The more popular the monarchists become, the less likely the rigging would be successfully kept secret, but advisers say that the alternative is that the monarchists might win."

gre.112.t:0 "Monarchist Victory"
gre.112.d:0 "The question of the republic's future has finally been settled, and it is with celebration throughout the country that its people welcome back the royal family. There is, however, already disagreement on who should assume the throne: should it be King Alexander, the unpopular younger brother who ascended to the throne after his father and brother were originally exiled, or Prince George, the brother who should have been the heir and yet has never been king? Alexander is considered the more moderate and legitimate choice, considering George's autocratic tendencies, but George is clearly the popular favourite."

Riots have spread throughout the country, and syndicalist leader Athanasios Klaras has stepped in to take control. He and numerous army supporters have stormed parliament, arresting government leaders and declaring Nikos Zachariadis as interim President and dictator.

gre.119.d:0 "With the monarchist now solidly in control of the nation, those who remain loyal to republican values have begun turning away from liberal parties - and instead have turned to the socialist agrarians under the Rural Democratic Front. Their fortunes have been especially buoyed by endorsements from Greek syndicalists, who see gathering together under the agrarian banner as the only way of defeating the monarchists and conservatives now in control of the nation. Rural Democratic Front leaders have been courting the moderate left in recent weeks, and if they succeed then the agrarians will pose a potent force in the upcoming election."
gre.119.a:0 "Rather worrying..."

gre.120.t:0 "A Liberal and Socialist Coalition"
gre.120.d:0 "While there were fears that the moderate socialists would agree to ally with the hardline agrarians, those fears appear to have been unfounded. Today the National Unionist Party announced a coalition with the Liberal Party, with Georgios Papandreou and Nikolaos Plastiras reportedly having hashed out a deal to form a united cabinet. This will blunt the efforts of the Rural Democratic Front, and possibly poses a threat to the Peoples' Party in the next election."
gre.120.a:0 "Interesting."

Where does it belong in the international socialist community? How will its economy be restructured? What is to be done about the remaining republicans and monarchists who will surely struggle against the new order? In the end, the congress turned into a struggle between two men: the acting chairman, Nikos Zachariadis, and the charismatic general, Aris Velouchiotis. Velouchiotis's vision for Greece is much less forgiving, and far more geared towards turning the country into a military power, while Zachariadis argues that path will destroy Greece in the end."

Others say that a more diplomatic tactic is needed: work with the capitalists and convince them the communes will benefit them, and use incentives to win them over.

This would mean an end to hostilities with the Greeks, and a sorting out of our differences. What the Greeks are asking for is this: we give them any states integral to their country, and they give us ours, while each of us give up any claims to other territories. We also begin an exchange of population, with Turks in [GRE.GetNameDef] coming to [Root.GetNameDef] but our much greater number of Greeks leaving for their country. In exchange, they will sign a pact of non-aggression, and we will do the same.

For logistical reasons all governing will still take place in Constantinople for the time being."

gre.309.t:0 "Third Hellenic Civilization"
gre.309.d:0 "The republican era of Greece has been a scourge on the youth, lack of central authority and enforced morality has produced weak children. Children who are not fit to inherit the Greek state, therefore we have established the National Youth Organisation (Ethnikí Orgánosis Neoléas). This will instill the same sense of loyalty and duty that Spartan youth possesed, the youth of the nation will swear an oath to defend Greece at all costs. The activities of the EON include athletic events, parades, marches and military training, this will cultivate their national values and cooperational spirit. The goal of the EON is to build a generation of youth who will establish the ‘Third Hellenic Civilisation’, one that maintains the aesthetics of Ancient Greece and Byzantine whilst prepared to face the modern world..."

gre.310.t:0 "Caesaropapism"
gre.310.d:0 "From the 330 consecration of Constantiople through to the tenth century, the Emperors of Byzantine held great authority over the Church and religious affairs. This power was fit only for a divine monarch whose authority and rule was blessed by God, many centuries have passed since a leader of Greece could claim such holy blessings that would justify authority over the Church. That is until now, our Archigos has rebuilt Greece under the faith of Orhtodox Christianity. It is this dedication to faith that has allowed Greece to enter into a period of prosperity. Furthermore Ecumenical councils have been established to aid in the settlement of religious matters. The moral degradation and sins of republicanism, liberalism and syndicalism will never conquer the spirit of Greece!"

gre.264.t:0 "Georgios Kondylis Dead!"
gre.264.d:0 "Regent-for-life and prominent general, Georgios Kondylis, nicknamed ‘Keravnos’ or ‘Thunderbolt’, has sadly passed away due to a heart attack. The fierce military commander had a long history serving in the military, serving in the Crete expedition, Macedonian Struggle and as captain during the Balkan Wars. Beloved by many as a national hero, his reputation throughout the Weltkrieg was enough to strike fear into the hearts of Greece’s enemies. During the choas of post-Weltkrieg Greece he took power and offered stability to his people. With no apparent heir, a coalition congress has been formed to temporarily rule and restore order in our fractured nation."

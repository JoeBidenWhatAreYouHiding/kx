### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_HUYGHE_DESC:0 "Chevalier Armand Huyghé de Mahenge has long served the Force Publique as one of its more respected generals. Born in 1871, Huyghé studied at the Royal Military Academy as soon as he was of age and joined the Flandro-Wallonian Army soon after in 1891, quickly transferring to the Force Publique in 1893 and making his way for the Congo. Serving initially under the Leopold regime, Huyghé learned hard and fast how to survive in these harsh jungles, teaching him the skills he would need to eventually become one of the FP’s most important figures. After serving heroically in the Weltkrieg both at Yser and in East Africa, Huyghé further made a name for himself as a tried and true career soldier. Following the war, the aging veteran Huyghé decided to take a step back from front-line command and has gotten himself a less-stressful position as head of the local Force Publique detachment that guards the Congolese metropolis of Leopoldville. With this relaxed position under his belt, Huyghé has worked diligently to maintain an unseen atmosphere of peace and stability within the city and its surrounding rural expanse - a talent that has proven far more relevant now that the Congo finds itself thrown into chaos. Under Armand Huyghé, Leopoldville is safe, but should this aging general slip up, who knows what shall happen to this Gem of the Congo he is sworn to protect."
POLITICS_KIMBANGU_DESC:0 "Whether you believe he was delivered to the top of Mount Zion as an infant or simply born and left orphaned in a cruel but necessary twist of fate, none can deny the mystery and awe-inspiring glory that surrounds Simon Kimbangu, or ‘the one who reveals the hidden meaning of all things.’ Born sometime in 1889, though his followers preach absolutely that he was born on September 12th, 1887, Kimbangu was an orphan taken in by Baptist missionaries, setting his life from the beginning to a track devout service to the Lord. As he grew older, he began work as a catechist around his home of Nkamba, preaching through the lands of the Bakongo, and becoming famous for his reputed ability to perform miracles. Purportedly able to heal the sick and cure the blind, Kimbangu possessed many claimed mystical powers such as astral projection, premonition, and levitation. Largest of his claims, or more accurately the claims of his sons and followers, is that Kimbangu is not only a servant of divinity, but he is divinity itself, for he is the Holy Spirit itself made manifest. As the Ngunza, or prophet, Kimbangu is the herald of the true African Jesus Christ and the new savior of the Congo. However, as these powers and claims gained him more favor with his fellow Congolese, it conversely drew the ire of the old colonial order. Though preaching an innately apolitical creed, the Force Publique took great offense to Kimbangu’s preachings, and had him imprisoned in 1921 after a series of riots and protests broke out in and around Leopoldville that were started by Kimbangu loyalists. Though he kept in contact with his people, Kimbangu languished in prison for almost two decades until he was freed during the early chaos of the Congo Civil War. \n\nNow, with his shackles broken and his lungs filled with the free air once again, the Ngunza Kimbangu preaches the good word of the Lord as he crusades to peacefully end sin and conflict across Congo and the wider African world. As the physical embodiment of the Holy Spirit, he shall bring divinity and salvation to this new Eden."

### Ideas ###
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea:0 "Control of Port Matadi"
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea_desc:0 "We control what may be the most important piece of infrastructure in all of Congo - the Port of Matadi. Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."

LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea3_desc:0 "We control what may be the most important piece of infrastructure in all of Congo - the Port of Matadi. Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."

LPD_martial_law_idea:0 "Rule of the Force Publique"
LPD_martial_law_idea_desc:0 "Though the civilian government is still nominally within control, the city of Leopoldville and its surrounding districts and zones of control exists under a strict regime and atmosphere of martial law led by the leading officers of the Force Publique left in the city. These soldiers and militias enforce a sense of order and calm within this African metropolis, creating a placid oasis of relative peace here in this chaotic Congo at the expense of civil liberty. The Force Publique must not take their rule too far or act too harshly, lest the locals throw of the looming spectre of the FP once and for all."

LPD_kimbagu_agitation_idea:0 "Kimbanguist Agitation"
LPD_kimbagu_agitation_idea_desc:0 ""

LPD_fp_military_force_idea:0 "Evolving into a Full Army"
LPD_fp_military_force_idea_desc:0 "Though the Force Publique was intended to be just a police force, it has since grown into something far exceeding this original purpose. This expansion and massive degree of militarization cannot simply be undone nor reversed, and so we must embrace it. The Force Publique shall become the official armed forces of the Congo, expanded and with the troops more thoroughly trained so that each and every new member can be held to the same high standards. Under the reformed Force Publique, the Congo shall be safe from all threats, foreign and domestic, as we strive to wipe away the black mark that has stained the FP’s reputation for decades."

LPD_nationalized_umhk:0 "Nationalized UMHK"
LPD_nationalized_umhk_desc:0 "For far too long has the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga controlled the economy of the Congo, selling off the riches and bounties of this land for their own profit while giving little to the Force Publique and the colonial government. This ends now, for the UMHK shall be shackled to the whims of the state. Through force and strong arming by means of gun-toting diplomacy, we shall effectively nationalize this monopoly by fully leashing it to our whim. Under this new arrangement, we will ensure we get our slice without leaving any room for error and without anyone else dipping into our profit margins."

LPD_working_with_industrialists:0 "Working with Industrialists"
LPD_working_with_industrialists_desc:0 "Though it may pain our administration to do so, we must negotiate with the greedy industrialists who have long lorded over the Congo’s economy. By reaching out to massive corporations like the Krupp-Mittelafrika and the UMHK and offering enticing arrangements, we shall strike a deal that profits both of our groups, allowing our own regime and these rabid capitalists to both pursue our own agendas without getting in each other's way."

LPD_broken_up_umhk:0 "UMHK Broken"
LPD_broken_up_umhk_desc:0 "The colonial monopolies of the Congo have long strangled any hope of a small business sector or any independent business at all developing. The massive conglomerates of the Congo, namely the UMHK, shall be shattered into smaller constituent business and sold off to the highest bidders - open to both African and Colonial buyers. To ensure some Africans get in on the action, certain auctions shall be Africa-only to ensure a Black business class begins to develop."

LPD_nationalized_umhk_kanza:0 "Nationalized UMHK"
LPD_nationalized_umhk_kanza_desc:0 "The UMHK accounts for over 70% of the Congo’s national economic output. A monopoly of this scale should have never been allowed to be created, and as such, we shall subsume this behemoth into the government in its entirety. With this conglomerate fully under the control of the Kanza regime, we can be sure any and all profits shall go directly to aiding the Congolese people on their road to independence."

LPD_miracles_idea:0 "Performing Miracles"
LPD_miracles_idea_desc:0 "The Ngunza is said to hold many powerful abilities and powers granted to him by God himself. As the Holy Spirit given flesh, he is able to see the future and commune directly with God and Jesus Christ, who grant him the ability to perform miracles. Able to cure the blind, deaf, and mute, treat any illness, and halt any disease, Kimbangu is as bonafide a miracle worker as the Son of God himself. With these powers, and with the help of the growing Congolese government under him, these miracles shall be made a reality on a national scale as we work to care for each and everyone of our people and deliver them from suffering."

LPD_cleansing_of_sin_idea:0 "Cleansing of Sin"
LPD_cleansing_of_sin_idea_desc:0 "To fall to sin and vice is a tale as old as time. Gambling, smoking, dancing, expressive singing, nudity, indecency, and more shall be banned and cleansed from our society as we embrace our Puritan roots. Only accepted forms of expression shall be allowed, such as the singing of hymnals and bathing while clothed, for without these guidelines our nation would surely fall back into chaos and crisis once more."

LPD_cleansing_of_sin2:0 "Cleansing of Sin"
LPD_cleansing_of_sin2_desc:0 "To fall to sin and vice is a tale as old as time. Gambling, smoking, dancing, expressive singing, nudity, indecency, and more shall be banned and cleansed from our society as we embrace our Puritan roots. Only accepted forms of expression shall be allowed, such as the singing of hymnals and bathing while clothed, for without these guidelines our nation would surely fall back into chaos and crisis once more."

LPD_congolese_identity_idea:0 "United Congolese Identity"
LPD_congolese_identity_idea_desc:0 "Simon Kimbagu has risen to become the true Father of the new unified Congolese identity. Under his watch, a cohesive Congolese culture has begun to blossom, centered around his church and his teachings. In the face of colonialism, our varied and numerous peoples persevered through Hell and back, and in the end have been rewarded with sovereignty and true national unity."

### Focuses ###

LPD_defend_the_city:0 "The Gem of the Vrijstaat"
LPD_defend_the_city_desc:0 "Whether you call it Leopoldville or Kinshasa, the varied people of this African metropolis have a great love for their city. As one of the largest cities on this continent, we rule over a vast amount of people but also have a massive amount of resources at our disposal. We must defend this gem of the Congo, no matter the cost, even as whispers of old foes surface among this chaos."

LPD_declare_independence:0 "The Declaration of Independence"
LPD_declare_independence_desc:0 "We have been cast adrift onto this sea of chaos that has replaced and consumed the once pristine and placid region of Congo. To consolidate our rule as we find our metropolis tossed into the role of a provisional government, we must issue a formal declaration of independence from the Congo colony. Under the leadership of General Armand Huyghé and the Force Publique, a new sovereign city-state shall rise here on Congo’s lone corridor to the sea. Whether you are a settler of Leopoldville or a Kinois of Kinshasa, we must band together as Congo falls to crisis!"

LPD_fate_of_the_north:0 "Fate of the Congo"
LPD_fate_of_the_north_desc:0 "To the East of our cosmopolitan haven, the rest of the Congo is embroiled in fierce war as mercenaries and natives rise against the colonialist machine. We must decide here and now what our policy towards these collapse-states shall be. Whether we soldier on to defend the colonial dream or decide to abandon our imperialism-born identity, we shall ever preserve this oasis of tranquility we have crafted."

LPD_unify_congo:0 "Congolese Unification"
LPD_unify_congo_desc:0 "The vast colonial apparatus that once ruled over this region we call Congo had long squandered their opportunity at creating a stable and cohesive nation. It falls onto us to crusade across the former lands of the Vrijstaat to create a truly pluralistic federation that can withstand the chaotic rigors of nation-building in Africa."

LPD_the_force_publique:0 "Free Reign of the Force Publique"
LPD_the_force_publique_desc:0 "The Force Publique has long served as the final line of defense between Congo and absolute chaos. Their oppressive but effective tactics are infamous throughout the colony, and despite their aging equipment and dwindling White officer corp, the natives in their employ make up for it with their savagery and tenacity. We must write a blank cheque to allow this last sword and shield of our safety free reign to do as they deem necessary to preserve our stability and safety."

LPD_support_the_government:0 "Recognize the Free State"
LPD_support_the_government_desc:0 "The Vrijstaat, or Free State, is the rightful Congolese government, and as such, our natural allies. Long has the city of Leopoldville served the Ryckmans Regime, and this cooperation shall continue. Our metropolis is the largest and most influential in all of Congo and serves as the colony’s only access to the sea; they simply can not survive without us, and we both know it."

LPD_rejoin_the_freestate:0 "The Question of Unification"
LPD_rejoin_the_freestate_desc:0 "Though our territorial extent is small, we are the bigger player in these coming negotiations. As the most important city and only seaport in all of Congo, the Ryckmans Regime will simply not survive without resources and opportunities that float into our harbor. We will approach them about unification, but if they choose to accept, we will hold their nation and all future ambitions of Congo by the balls."

LPD_team_switzerland:0 "Pledge Neutrality"
LPD_team_switzerland_desc:0 "To pick a side in this Congolese civil war would tear our nation apart. We must profess strict neutrality in this conflict as we work to secure our citizens from this maelstrom. We have far more important things to focus on instead of shooting our own countrymen in the mud."

LPD_be_nice_to_the_natives:0 "Metropolitan Cosmopolitanism"
LPD_be_nice_to_the_natives_desc:0 "Our fair city is massive, stretching across both sprawling urban and rural zones, holding thousands of souls and dozens of ethnic groups and minorities. We must account and care for each and every one of these groups, without favoritism, lest our entire city-state collapse into the same chaos that has befallen our fellow Congolese. All shall be welcome in our city limits as long as they abide by our rules."

LPD_defend_the_port:0 "The Mouth of the Congo"
LPD_defend_the_port_desc:0 "We control what may be the most important piece of infrastructure in all of Congo - the Port of Matadi. Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."

LPD_fortify_the_city:0 "From a City to a Fortress"
LPD_fortify_the_city_desc:0 "Our first and last stand against any enemy will likely take place at the gates of this city we call home, and as such, we must not allow it to fall. Leopoldville shall be transformed into an imposing and unassailable bastion. Walls shall be raised, bunkers and pillboxes constructed, and barbed wire and mines placed across our perimeter. Any foe wishing to take this city will have to crash through these defenses and cut us down to the last man."

##Huyghé Tree

LPD_hughyes_congo:0 "The Velvet Glove of the Chevalier"
LPD_hughyes_congo_desc:0 "Armand Huyghé has lead Leopoldville and the Force Publique through thick and thin, and has emerged from the other side of this calamity as the leader of the FP, continuing his role but now taking on the gargantuan task of administering not just a military force and a city, but an entire nation as well. Holding dear to the status quo while inching towards modernization and slightly more equitable policies, Huyghé shall be a stable and predictable leader for this post-Crisis Congo, seeking to strike a balance between colonial and native interests."

LPD_new_status_quo:0 "The New Status Quo"
LPD_new_status_quo_desc:0 "We have established our rule over all of the former lands of the Vrijstaat, and now we stand as the new masters of the wild lands of Congo. The Force Publique is still nominally in charge, and has now declared an intention to slowly return to civilian colonial rule. Embracing the ideas that saved our city and forged our new sense of unity, we shall spread these pluralistic principles to all people of the Congo as we struggle to repair the schism that caused the crisis we have endeavored through."

LPD_strike_a_balance:0 "Strike a Balance"
LPD_strike_a_balance_desc:0 "We must take a measured hand to our rule over this new Congolese state, for we are in untested waters. The refined Force Publique shall serve as the shepherds of this new nation, slowly building up the necessary bureaucracy and administrations needed to transition to a more permanent state in the far future. By balancing a need for stability with a desire for freedom and pluralism, the FP will attempt to lay the foundations of our new state."

LPD_promise_not_to_do_leopold_things:0 "Never Another Leopold"
LPD_promise_not_to_do_leopold_things_desc:0 "The horrors of the reign of King Leopold II are still fresh in the minds of all Congolese, especially the natives, forever scaring the image of colonial rule and sullying the word of Europeans in the minds of many Africans. We must make clear to our new populace that the madness of the Leopold regime will never be allowed to return to these lands, and that the remaining colonists and settlers are here to contribute to this new society as equally as their newfound countrymen."

LPD_democracy_in_quotation_marks:0 "A Budding ‘Democracy’"
LPD_democracy_in_quotation_marks_desc:0 "To make good on our promises, the Force Publique and General Armand Huyghé have decided to make way for ‘fair and free’ elections. Though only accepted, non-radical parties have been allowed to run and some rumors of tampering have circulated around, the FP assures us that this is truly the arrival of bonafide democracy here in Congo."

LPD_local_autonomy:0 "Tribal Autonomies"
LPD_local_autonomy_desc:0 "Within our borders exist many native kingdoms, chiefdoms, and barely-contacted tribes. In order to quell any potential unrest from these masses, we shall grant them large amounts of autonomy, giving them free reign to rule their own people as they please while nominally existing within our burgeoning federal structure. They will still be forced to pay some sort of tithe to our government like any of our citizens, but given their positions, monetary compensation is not always feasible or even the best option. Any groups that do not wish to or can not pay can instead offer their produced goods, manpower, or anything else, and in return, they can largely do as they please, so long as it does not interfere with our mission here."

LPD_congolese_federalism:0 "Congolese Federalism"
LPD_congolese_federalism_desc:0 "A true Congolese Federation once seemed like a fantasy, but now this idea can become a reality. Embracing our roots as cosmopolitan people in a massively diverse region, we shall attempt an experiment unlike any seen in Africa so far - a true democratic federation. Constituent ‘states’ shall range from autonomous kingdoms to newly created administrative provinces. Emulating larger nations such as the United States and the Kaiserreich, we will create a true, united federation of Congolese states, all under the colonial federal government."

LPD_allow_blacks_to_run:0 "Open the Government to Africans"
LPD_allow_blacks_to_run_desc:0 "The oppressive atmosphere of inequality that has long existed here in the Congo was one of the key reasons why the Vrijstaat fell and why our city almost fell victim to internal upheaval. To alleviate this long-building tension, we shall open up the colonial government to a small number of trusted native officials. Filling out the lower ranks within our bureaucratic hierarchy and within local government systems as administrators, liaisons, and nominal representatives, we shall throw the Africans a proverbial bone to sate their desire for self-rule as we continue to entrench our positions."

LPD_colonials_only:0 "Keep True to the Colonial Mission"
LPD_colonials_only_desc:0 "The continuation of the colonial project is paramount, and after the recent waves of chaos and internal turmoil emanating from the natives, many within the government are now wary of giving the Africans any taste of self-determination. We shall pander to these concerns of the colonial Old Guard and maintain the status quo of the Vrijstaat. Instead of emancipation, which would only lead to more chaos and uncertainty, we shall work to continue our imperialist endeavours without interference from the locals."

LPD_parliment_under_hughye:0 "A Guided Colonial Parliament"
LPD_parliment_under_hughye_desc:0 "With our regime restabilizing and our new frameworks put in place, the Congo is ready to return to ‘civilian’ rule. The colonial parliament shall be reconvened, with the Force Publique finally taking a step back from rule and ending the long-standing environment of martial law. However, though these colonial bureaucrats, businessmen, and nobles shall now be given the reins of power once more, returning the Congo to a far less military-orientated colonial administration, they still will be heavily shackled by the whims of Governor-General Huyghé, who shall still hold sweeping executive powers with the backing of the Force Publique."

LPD_fp_police_force:0 "Return to a Pure Police Force"
LPD_fp_police_force_desc:0 "The Force Publique was always intended to be a mere peacekeeping force here in the Congo, not the massive military behemoth it has become. We were meant to protect and serve this fair colony, not to burn and plunder its riches while we neglect the natives. Our duty is to protect and police the people within our colony, not wage war in foreign lands or oppress the very souls we are meant to safeguard. The Force Publique shall be expanded to all cities and townships within our colony, but minorly demilitarized to show our good faith in our new direction. To replace them, a new national army for the Congo colony shall be created from the ground up, incorporating African and Colonial tactics and components to serve as a new syncretic defense force of the nation. The growing pains from creating a new army from scratch will be immense, but the pain will be worth it in the end."

LPD_fp_military_force:0 "Evolve into a Full Army"
LPD_fp_military_force_desc:0 "Though the Force Publique was intended to be just a police force, it has since grown into something far exceeding this original purpose. This expansion and massive degree of militarization cannot simply be undone nor reversed, and so we must embrace it. The Force Publique shall become the official armed forces of the Congo, expanded and with the troops more thoroughly trained so that each and every new member can be held to the same high standards. Under the reformed Force Publique, the Congo shall be safe from all threats, foreign and domestic, as we strive to wipe away the black mark that has stained the FP’s reputation for decades."

LPD_allow_more_blacks_in_fp:0 "Raise Black Conscription Rates"
LPD_allow_more_blacks_in_fp_desc:0 "Whatever our policy and doctrine, one thing in warfare is for certain: we need bodies. The only way to defend our lands and to fight the wars of the future is if we have enough able-bodied men armed with the latest equipment to be able to fill our frontlines and foxholes. As a colonial administration thousands of miles from its nation of origin, the only way we are going to achieve this goal is by using more African conscripts in our ranks. The Force Publique has long used black soldiers, but they have been mostly kept from command and specialist positions. We must allow small numbers of Blacks into these ranks while massively opening the doors for African recruitment, for our army and our nation will not survive without it."

##Janssens Tree

LPD_little_maniac:0 "The Iron Fist of the Petit Maniaque"
LPD_little_maniac_desc:0 "Émile Janssens has risen through the ranks of the Force Publique, and, after proving himself capable of suppressing malcontent in this wild Congo, has been given complete command over both the Force Publique and the wider colonial apparatus as acting Governor-General Huyghé’s right-hand man. Under this Little Maniac, discipline and order shall be brought to the Congo from the hands of the colonials, and at the end of their barrels if need be."

LPD_crush_nationalists:0 "Crush Nationalist Movements"
LPD_crush_nationalists_desc:0 "Nationalism is a righteous and empowering idea - an idea respected by Janssens who have long espoused nationalist Flemish beliefs - but in the hands of these savages, it could prove to be our undoing. We must crush any and all native Congolese national movements and prevent a unified identity or bond from forming within the various groups outside the colonial system. Key figures in their national movement shall be arrested, and any who oppose shall be eliminated. While the Vrijstaat stands, any idea of a unified Congolese nation shall remain in the grave."

LPD_leopold_legacy:0 "Sire, ils Vous l'ont Cochonné"
LPD_leopold_legacy_desc:0 "’Sire, they’ve messed it all up.’ These words of our leader Commander Janssens echo through the minds of all true patriots and colonials, gnawing away at the back of our minds, for we know we have failed our true liege. Leopold II, may he rest eternally in peace, is rolling in his grace over our inability to manage the great Congo colony he built. This era of chaos, disgrace, and instability ends now! The Force Publique has a job to do; we have a job to do. The Congo will be made civilized by our hands!"

LPD_appoint_nationalists:0 "Invite Flandro-Wallonian Patriots"
LPD_appoint_nationalists_desc:0 "In order to secure colonial interests, Janssesn has moved to fill his cabinet and the advisory council of Huyghé with Flandro-Wallonian nationalists and staunch military men with known Imperialist sympathies. We shall pack the government with these like-minded patriots to secure our interests so that Janssens can pursue his ambitions without any obstacles, or any obstacles within the government at least."

LPD_white_immigration:0 "Rekindle the Pioneering Spirit"
LPD_white_immigration_desc:0 "The Congo has one of the largest White populations in Subsaharan Africa, but these citizens are still mere bright specks amidst a sea of Africans. We must send out the word to all back home in Flanders-Wallonia and across Europe to come to the Congo and settle down. We shall become the world’s new wild frontier, beckoning all adventurers or those seeking a fresh start to the Vrijstaat, and with each new White face that steps foot within our borders and digs their roots into our soil shall only further own power and mandate to rule."

LPD_fp_militarization:0 "Mass Militarization of the Force Publique"
LPD_fp_militarization_desc:0 "The Force Publique must be expanded to fully match the needs of our state. For too long have our forces been subjected to hand-me-down equipment and relics of a bygone age of warfare. We shall rectify this grievous mistake and push for nation-wide militarization. Factories and gunsmiths shall dot every settlement and the Force Publique shall expand the arsenal at its disposal to compensate for a lack of White manpower. Through steel and lead, the Congo shall be modernized and industrialized with war in mind from the get-go, for the Force Publique is the heart of the Vrijstaat - without them, we would be doomed."

LPD_white_officer_primacy:0 "White Officer Primacy"
LPD_white_officer_primacy_desc:0 "Though our infantry and the bulk of our fighting forces will be Black - a reality of living in the Congo - we must not let the untrained and undisciplined masses of Africans sully the sanctity of our officer corp. The military staff and leaders of the Congo must be of the most sound mind and body, able to serve the colony no matter the situation. As such, they must be of pure European stock and educated in the best officer schools the homeland has to offer. Under their leadership and purity, the Vrijstaat shall endure."

LPD_nationalize_umhk:0 "Leash the UMHK"
LPD_nationalize_umhk_desc:0 "For far too long has the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga controlled the economy of the Congo, selling off the riches and bounties of this land for their own profit while giving little to the Force Publique and the colonial government. This ends now, for the UMHK shall be shackled to the whims of the state. Through force and strong arming by means of gun-toting diplomacy, we shall effectively nationalize this monopoly by fully leashing it to our whim. Under this new arrangement, we will ensure we get our slice without leaving any room for error and without anyone else dipping into our profit margins."

LPD_work_with_industrialists:0 "Work with Tycoons and Industrialists"
LPD_work_with_industrialists_desc:0 "Though it may pain our administration to do so, we must negotiate with the greedy industrialists who have long lorded over the Congo’s economy. By reaching out to massive corporations like the Krupp-Mittelafrika and the UMHK and offering enticing arrangements, we shall strike a deal that profits both of our groups, allowing our own regime and these rabid capitalists to both pursue our own agendas without getting in each other's way."

LPD_army_with_a_state:0 "A Militant Congo Colony"
LPD_army_with_a_state_desc:0 "Under the tutelage of Émile Janssens and Armand Huyghé, the Force Publique has come to dominate the Congo once more. Never before have these jungles witnessed innovation and modernization like this - each factory and mine dedicated to the colony and the Force Publique above all else. The skies fill with smog and the grounds shaked beneath the jackboots of our troops as the Vrijstaat is further transformed into a state that puts the military above all other aspects of life and society."

LPD_harsher_crackdowns:0 "Crackdowns and Reprisals"
LPD_harsher_crackdowns_desc:0 "As we have moved to establish our new regime, riots and revolts have broken out across the Congo. Though not nearly on the scale of those rebellions which threw this paradise into utter chaos during the Great Crisis, they have nonetheless taken their toll on our healing regime. We must order the Force Publique to march into the wilds and crush these rioters and separatists before these issues get out of hand once more.

Serving under Huyghé as his right-hand man and lead civilian figure in the nation, Kanza - a Force Publique veteran noted for being one of the FP’s only Black officers - was deemed by Huyghé and his council to be the perfect choice for a mediated push for slow decolonization in light of the recent chaos and backlash towards colonial rule. Under Kanza and Huyghé, the Congo shall get a taste of self-determination and democracy as it slowly, securely, and, most importantly, peacefully marches towards independence."

Long fearing the Congo’s various ethnicities tearing the nation apart, Kanza disagreed with Kasa-Vubu’s stance on a federalist approach and instead preaches a unitary model for the Congo’s government. Creating his own party under the supervision of the colonials, Kanza seeks to create a unitary and singular Congolese state - united under one Congolese identity and supported by our European benefactors."

The top leaders of our nation, both colonial and African, shall fly and sail to Brussels, where history shall be made as the largest colony in Africa takes its first step on the road to peaceful decolonization.

leopoldville.1.t:0 "An African Metropolis"
leopoldville.1.d:0 "Leopoldville stands as the largest city in the Congo, and now also stands as one of the sole areas of peace here in the collapsing Vrijstaat. Lying on the site of the old village of Kinshasa, which many native Congolese have co-opted as a nickname for the city, Leopoldville was first settled in 1881 and has since become one of the most important sites in the nation. With the German and Flandro-Wallonian mandate burning to ash and cinder, we have been thrust into the dark, isolated and cutoff from the rest of the Congo here on our only strip of Coast. With the Port of Matadi under our control, we have secured the only major seaport in the nation, and must use this as a lifeline until the terrible war is finished. \n\nThough the civilian council of the system is still in control in theory and the Ryckmans is still nominally in charge, in reality the Force Publique under General [LPD.getleader] rules over the city has and has enacted martial law. This military government now balances on a delicate edge between falling to the rising waves of unrest and anti-colonial sentiments and being conquered by the rebelling mercenaries and Congolese natives to the East. \n\nIf the residents of Leopoldville can survive this maelstrom without tearing the city apart, this cosmopolitan metropolis may just teach the rest of the Congo something about the benefits of cooperation. However, not all is as serene as it seems, as an old foe has broken out of their near 30-year prison sentence in Elisabethville as the region collapsed into war, and this old, infamous prophet has been seen slowly making his way back home. No matter the foe, domestic or foreign, this shining Gem of the Congo shall not falter!"

leopoldville.2.t:0 "Our Allies in the Force Publique Make an Offer"
leopoldville.2.d:0 "The Force Publique-led military government in Leopoldville under General Armand Huyghé has petitioned our government to join their growing coalition of colonialist holdouts. If we accepted, we would be forced under the rule of the FP and Huyghé, throwing away our sovereignty for mere autonomy under their control. Alternatively, we could just deny this ludicrous request, but as a result we may have to face the wrath of the Force Publique on the open battlefield. How shall we respond?"

With their victory, these imperialists have come knockin on our doors once more asking for us to reintegrate ourselves back into the wider Vrijstaat’s colonial government. If we were to accept, we would be fully integrated back into their borders, though given autonomy and extra incentives and benefits for agreeing to holster our weapons for the good of our colonists and the Force Publique’s command structure. However, we could just simply deny these fools instead, seeing as they already failed their previous mandate to rule, though doing so would likely incur their wrath. How shall we respond?"

leopoldville.6.t:0 "A Training ‘Accident’"
leopoldville.6.d:0 "Lieutenant-General Émile Janssens has long been a vocal and virulent advocate for colonial rule. Across his career, he has made a name for himself as a true disciple of Leopold II, acting as a harsh and oftentimes cruel, but undeniably effective military commander of the Force Publique. Often getting into rants about the Force Publique’s duty and the need for purity and separation, Janssens has come into the national spotlight recently over comments made during a training session at one of our army bases. Barking at black recruits over their inability to effectively lead troops with organization and discipline, a Kikongo trainee snapped and lurched at Janssens with his training-issued knife. Without hesitation, Janssens pulled out his MLE. 1903 and fired two rounds quickly through the skull of the charging brute. As his head began to spout blood and brains from the two exit wounds out the back of his skull, Janssens pulled out his neckerchief to wipe the soot and blood splatter from the barrel while remarking to the surrounding trainees that any of them could meet a similar fate at any moment - a hollow threat if not for the pistol in his hand and the six white officers standing behind him, each armed with their standard-issue FN Mle. 89/36 rifles. \n\nThe fallout of this event has pushed the Congo closer to collapse as the African ranks of the FP across the nation are in an uproar, clamoring for something to be done. Now it i"

leopoldville.7.t:0 "Nothing Will Change!"
leopoldville.7.d:0 "As if the last incident was not bad enough, Émile Janssens has managed to get himself into even deeper trouble with the Africans within the Force Publique than ever before - no small feat after years of oppressive tactics and even after shooting one conscript dead. Janssens, in a meeting with hundreds of low-ranking Black NCOs and the White officer corp of the FP concerning the growing instability within the Force Publique and the wider Congo as a whole, managed to make the national situation worse by directly stating his intention to never allow Blacks within the commissioned Officer Corp of the FP. Doubling down, he has stated that even if colonial rule was to collapse, he would still rule the FP as dictated by his predecessors and by Leopold II, never allowing the African race to sully the purity of his precious paramilitary. \n\nThese comments have sent the nation into an uproar, and the African conscripts within the FP are frothing at the mouth in their anger over Janssesn callus comments. The various cliques within the FP’s lower ranks have banded together and sent an ultimatum to Janssens’ office today, demanding his immediate resignation, or else. Though this is likely a hollow threat, we must stay vigilant, for it seems the Congo is walking on a knife’s edge."

leopoldville.8.t:0 "The Leopoldville Mutiny"
leopoldville.8.d:0 "With our regime’s inaction over the comments made by Émile Janssens, and over his direct murder of one FP conscript, the Africans of the Force Publique’s Leopoldville guard regiments have done the unthinkable and mutinied against the White-dominated officer corp and our regime. All of Leopoldville, once our shining and peaceful metropolis, has now fallen into utter chaos, with urban warfare and violent riots breaking out across the city. Even worse, it seems the mutiny and these following riots have been fueled by followers of the false prophet Simon Kimbangu, who has long been a thorn in the side of our mandate. With these religious fanatics working with the revolting FP soldiers, many fear that this crisis could spiral out of hand very quickly and spread throughout the Congo if we do not act quickly. However, despite the exponentially growing urgency of the matter, many within our regime are still hesitant to act, fearing further reprisals will only lead to further chaos. Ultimately, the choice is up to our acting leader Commander Huyghé."

leopoldville.9.t:0 "The Rise of the Ngunza"
leopoldville.9.d:0 "Our inaction has proven to be our undoing, and the tainted light of colonialism now fades in the Congo. In its place, now shines the light of the Lord! Simon Kimbangu, the prophet, the Ngunza, the true preacher of God’s truths, and the physical incarnation of the Holy Spirit has parted the turbulent sea of chaos that has flooded Leopoldville, stepping forth as the savior of the Congo. Once imprisoned for his beliefs, he has since escaped and found vindication, now rising to lead all of Leopoldville with an army of followers at his side. With his ascension, the old colonial order and the Force Publique shall be cast out, deemed as heathens and heretics, and banished to Hell or the dark recesses of our primordial jungles while the true sons of the Lord revel in their new land of milk and honey. Under Papa Kimbangu’s pious, divinely-blessed rule, the Congo shall be transformed into the true Eden it was meant to be, for the Congo is the true birthplace of Christianity, the birthplace of Humanity, and now shall be the birthplace of Africa’s divine emancipation."
leopoldville.9.a:0 "The one true prophet shall be the Congo’s salvation!"

leopoldville.10.t:0 "The Fate of the False Prophet"
leopoldville.10.d:0 "With the mutineers either slain or jailed and the riots crushed, now comes the time to deal with the chief instigator of this chaos. Simon Kimangu, a nutjob and false prophet preying on the weak and feeble, or perhaps just feeble and deluded himself, has been captured by our forces at the Southern border of Baskongo where he was attempting to escape into Angola. Catching him in the act before he could make his border crossing, one of our local agents shot him in the thigh to prevent his escape, and we now have the deluded old fool in custody. With his arrest, we are now left with a choice. We can either repeat our past method and merely imprison him, this time in a more secure facility in our homeland of Flanders-Wallonia, ensuring his inability to influence Congolese affairs. Alternatively, we can just end this simply, here and now, and schedule Kimbangu a date with the hangman at once, ending the saga of the Ngunza once and for all."
leopoldville.10.a:0 "Simply return him to his old prison cell, under higher guard this time."
leopoldville.10.b:0 "He escaped death once, not again. Ready the gallows for their newest toy!"

leopoldville.11.t:0 "How to Temper the Will of the Lord"
leopoldville.11.d:0 "The holy Ngunza has begun to consolidate his rule, and the strength of his new faith, over our domain. With this consolidation, a final choice must be made on the direction of our new state. Simon Kimbangu has long been a largely apolitical figure, preaching the true Gospel as opposed to any ideology or political creed while willing to work with any and all of God’s children. \n\nThis lack of personal bias and openness to cooperate with all forces has led Kimbangu to having a massive array of varied allies and friends that would serve as ideal administrators and ministers to serve the Ngunza and help him rule over the vast expanse that is the Congo. \n\nKimbangu could work with ‘Nzerian’ figures such as Louis de Gonzague Bobozo and his young protege Joseph-Désiré Mobutu and other Congolese nationalists in the MNC and the ANC, cementing his status as the national father of the Congo and moving the nation in a minorly nationalist direction. On the far end of that spectrum, Kimbangu could instead reach out to old radical allies in French Congo, Angola, and Gabon, painting Ngunzism in a Red, or at least ‘pink’ light, adopting a form of Christian-Socialist teachings. \n\nAlternatively, the Ngunza could take the nation in a far less polarized direction and instead focus solely on the One True Faith. Forming a council with his sons Joseph Diangienda, Charles-Daniel Kisolokeke, and most prominently Salomon Dialungana Kiangani, these four ‘Papas’ of the Congo would lead the nation in all matters political and spiritual, with a council of advisors aiding them. Taking this idea a step further, a more democratically-aligned group led by Jean Bolikango and Daniel Kanza seeks to utilize this system as well, but with the council of advisors being democratically elected Congolese who are pre-vetted by Kimbangu and his sons as pious enough to run for office. \n\nOpposing all of these ideas, or perhaps pulling the all together, is the final option. Drawing on all allies of Kimbangu, a union of his followers would be made under the Ngunza himself, with each faction having some minor say in government, but mostly serving as mere advisors. In this system, Kimbangu’s word, or perhaps more accurately the words of his sons through Kimbagu’s mouth, shall be law, and much of the nation shall remain as-is. Whatever system we settle on, we can be sure the world has never seen quite a system like it."
leopoldville.11.a:0 "With the nationalists and the Nzerians, Kimbangu shall make the Congo pure."
leopoldville.11.b:0 "Along with his sons, Kimbangu shall be the Father of the Congo."
leopoldville.11.c:0 "Working with devout republicans, Kimbangu shall usher in true Christian democracy."
leopoldville.11.e:0 "Only the radicals from Angola and Kinshasa can truly hear God’s whispers."
leopoldville.11.f:0 "Our Ngunza shall remain apolitical, with a mixed cabinet serving as his advisors."

leopoldville.14.t:0 "Where to Go from Here?"
leopoldville.14.d:0 "After untold bloodshed, horrific violence, and the complete collapse of societal order, the Congo has emerged from its civil war with colonial rule and the supremacy of the Force Publique just barely managing to stay intact. From this chaotic gauntlet, the Vrijstaat has reemerged under a new regime, one separate from the failings of Ryckmans and ready to lead the Congo in this new age. \n\nHowever, the goals, aims, members, and other specifics of this new regime have yet to be ironed out, and the Congo now stands at a crossroads. At the whims of Commander Armand Huyghé, the colonial mission here must now decide on how best to move forward. Long standing as a bastion of the status quo and as a moderate within the Force Publique, Huyghé stands as the ideal candidate to take over the role of Governor-General, where being an apolitical military man will limit the regime’s vulnerability to personal biases. However, choosing who shall rule alongside Huyghé has been rather difficult. \n\nCommander Huyghé could rule with his council at his side and with the shackled colonial parliament under him like the Ryckmans Regime before him, or he could take one of two more decisive directions. Émile Janssens, leader of the Force Publique under Huyghé and the cause of much of the unrest that sparked the Leopoldville Riots, Commander Janssens would be a controversial pick to be sure to serve as Huyghé’s Deputy Governor, but his military experience and veterancy in putting down the natives could prove useful. Going with such a known colonial hardliner and nationalist imperialist would certainly cement to all within the Congo that the Vrijstaat and colonial rule is here to stay. Alternatively, Huyghé could instead choose Daniel Kanza Kinsona, one of the few Black officers within the FP and a moderate democrat who only seeks to lessen the plight of his fellow Congolese. By going with Kanza, Huyghé would affirm to the world that decolonization is in the future for the Congo as he and Kanza slowly worked to create a true nation here in Africa’s Dark Heart and prepare it for the rigors of independent nationhood. Whatever Huyghé’s choice, he must make it carefully, for the lives of millions, both African and colonials, hang in the balance."
leopoldville.14.a:0 "Armand Huyghé shall serve alone as he seeks to maintain the status quo." 
leopoldville.14.b:0 "Émile Janssens shall serve under Huyghé and move to secure the colonial system." 
leopoldville.14.c:0 "Daniel Kanza shall serve under Huyghé and move towards peaceful, gradual decolokingnization."

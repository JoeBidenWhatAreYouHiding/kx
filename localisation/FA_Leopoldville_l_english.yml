### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_HUYGHE_DESC:0 "Chevalier Armand Huyghé de Mahenge has long served the Force Publique as one of its more respected generals. Born in 1871, Huyghé studied at the Royal Military Academy as soon as he was of age and joined the Flandro-Wallonian Army soon after in 1891, quickly transferring to the Force Publique in 1893 and making his way for the Congo. Serving initially under the Leopold regime, Huyghé learned hard and fast how to survive in these harsh jungles, teaching him the skills he would need to eventually become one of the FP’s most important figures. After serving heroically in the Weltkrieg both at Yser and in East Africa, Huyghé further made a name for himself as a tried and true career soldier. Following the war, the aging veteran Huyghé decided to take a step back from front-line command and has gotten himself a less-stressful position as head of the local Force Publique detachment that guards the Congolese metropolis of Leopoldville. With this relaxed position under his belt, Huyghé has worked diligently to maintain an unseen atmosphere of peace and stability within the city and its surrounding rural expanse - a talent that has proven far more relevant now that the Congo finds itself thrown into chaos. Under Armand Huyghé, Leopoldville is safe, but should this aging general slip up, who knows what shall happen to this Gem of the Congo he is sworn to protect."
POLITICS_KIMBANGU_DESC:0 "Whether you believe he was delivered to the top of Mount Zion as an infant or simply born and left orphaned in a cruel but necessary twist of fate, none can deny the mystery and awe-inspiring glory that surrounds Simon Kimbangu, or ‘the one who reveals the hidden meaning of all things.’ Born sometime in 1889, though his followers preach absolutely that he was born on September 12th, 1887, Kimbangu was an orphan taken in by Baptist missionaries, setting his life from the beginning to a track devout service to the Lord. As he grew older, he began work as a catechist around his home of Nkamba, preaching through the lands of the Bakongo, and becoming famous for his reputed ability to perform miracles. Purportedly able to heal the sick and cure the blind, Kimbangu possessed many claimed mystical powers such as astral projection, premonition, and levitation. Largest of his claims, or more accurately the claims of his sons and followers, is that Kimbangu is not only a servant of divinity, but he is divinity itself, for he is the Holy Spirit itself made manifest. As the Ngunza, or prophet, Kimbangu is the herald of the true African Jesus Christ and the new savior of the Congo. However, as these powers and claims gained him more favor with his fellow Congolese, it conversely drew the ire of the old colonial order. Though preaching an innately apolitical creed, the Force Publique took great offense to Kimbangu’s preachings, and had him imprisoned in 1921 after a series of riots and protests broke out in and around Leopoldville that were started by Kimbangu loyalists. Though he kept in contact with his people, Kimbangu languished in prison for almost two decades until he was freed during the early chaos of the Congo Civil War. \n\nNow, with his shackles broken and his lungs filled with the free air once again, the Ngunza Kimbangu preaches the good word of the Lord as he crusades to peacefully end sin and conflict across Congo and the wider African world. As the physical embodiment of the Holy Spirit, he shall bring divinity and salvation to this new Eden."
POLITICS_KANZA_DESC:0 "Not only one of the only Black officers within the Force Publique but also one of the youngest, Daniel Kanza has been close to the colonial regime his whole life. A Kongo man by birth and born in 1909 in Manianga, Kanza received a Protestant education at a seminary before volunteering for the FP as soon as he was of age. Seeing cooperation with the colonials as the only true path to both independence and a free, democratic Congo, Kanza has proven himself to be correct, for peace has finally been brought to this primordial paradise. Only through the partnership of all Congolese - colonial and native - was this peace achieved. Under his watch, Leopoldville-Kinshasa has been saved, and so has the wider Congo as a whole. The Congo Crisis shall become a distant memory as Kanza and his mixed cabinet of colonials and Congolese independence figures slowly work to bring full self-rule to the Congo. Although colonial rule holds on for now, it is a far cry from its old, overtly imperialist past. Kanza has promised that there will never be another Leopold and that, on his word, true independence and democracy shall eventually come to our united people."
POLITICS_JANNSENS_DESC:0 "Born as Émile Robert Alphonse Hippolyte Janssens in 1902, few call our Governor-General by his real name anymore. Instead, he is most widely referred to as ‘L’Petit Maniaque’, or the Little Maniac. Hailing from Brussels, Janssens attended military school as a boy while the Weltkrieg raged, hoping it would last long enough for him to be able to reach enlistment age. Instead, he missed his chance as the guns fell silent, and to make up for lost time and lost glory, he signed up with the new Flandro-Wallonian colonial service and was shipped out to the Vrijstaat. Upon landing in Congo, Janssens fell in with the Force Publique and quickly rose through the rank of its officer corp, showing a fierce aptitude for efficient, if extremely brutal, suppression tactics - both against his foes and against his own Black troops. Earning a reputation as being an iron-fisted authoritarian, a fierce nationalist, and as having an unwavering dedication to the ideas and methods of the late Leopold II, the Little Maniac is one of the most feared men in the Congo while being one of the most respected young officers among the high command back in Brussels. With Leopoldville and the Congo under his tight control, Janssens seeks to restore the legacy of Leopold’s freestate and reaffirm the Colonial Trinity of God, Gold, and Glory, while also repairing the damages of the conflict he partially caused when he incited the Leopoldville Mutiny. He has vowed to his idol, the dead King Leopold II, and to all colonials, all members of the Force Publique, and to all within the Congo that he shall not allow the natives to mess this all up ever again."

### Ideas ###
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea:0 "Control of Port Matadi"
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea_desc:0 "We control what may be the most important piece of infrastructure in all of Congo - the Port of Matadi. Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea2:0 "Control of Port Matadi"

Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea3:0 "Control of Port Matadi"
LPD_mouth_of_the_congo_idea3_desc:0 "We control what may be the most important piece of infrastructure in all of Congo - the Port of Matadi. Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."

LPD_martial_law_idea:0 "Rule of the Force Publique"
LPD_martial_law_idea_desc:0 "Though the civilian government is still nominally within control, the city of Leopoldville and its surrounding districts and zones of control exists under a strict regime and atmosphere of martial law led by the leading officers of the Force Publique left in the city. These soldiers and militias enforce a sense of order and calm within this African metropolis, creating a placid oasis of relative peace here in this chaotic Congo at the expense of civil liberty. The Force Publique must not take their rule too far or act too harshly, lest the locals throw of the looming spectre of the FP once and for all."

LPD_kimbagu_agitation_idea:0 "Ngunzist Agitation"
LPD_kimbagu_agitation_idea_desc:0 "As if the Congo did not have enough problems, a strange mystic named Simon Kimbangu, or as his followers call him the Ngunza, has been the icon of a new religion whose followers have been proselytizing his syncretic Chrstian faith throughout our borders for years. Primarily stationed in Nkamba, his birthplace and just a stone’s throw away from Leopoldville, his followers have proven to be a large nuisance to our colonial mission. Preaching a non-violent, ascetic, Africanized form of Christianity and claiming to be the Holy Spirit and prophet of Jesus Christ while rousing the natives as a nationalist icon, Kimbangu has managed to anger both the colonial government and the Church. \n\nWhile he may currently reside in jail, arrested in 1921 over allegedly inciting riots against the colonial regime, that has not stopped the work of his disciples, nor himself who claims to still preach and work towards his final plan through astral projection and special rituals within prison. Their numbers only grow, despite our numerous efforts, and something must be done soon lest this tide of zealots wash over us and drown out the light of our colonialist dream."

LPD_team_switzerland_idea:0 "Pledge of Neutrality"
LPD_team_switzerland_idea_desc:0 "To pick a side in this Congolese civil war would tear our nation apart. We must profess strict neutrality in this conflict as we work to secure our citizens from this maelstrom. We have far more important things to focus on instead of shooting our own countrymen in the mud."

LPD_fp_military_force_idea:0 "Evolving into a Full Army"
LPD_fp_military_force_idea_desc:0 "Though the Force Publique was intended to be just a police force, it has since grown into something far exceeding this original purpose. This expansion and massive degree of militarization cannot simply be undone nor reversed, and so we must embrace it. The Force Publique shall become the official armed forces of the Congo, expanded and with the troops more thoroughly trained so that each and every new member can be held to the same high standards. Under the reformed Force Publique, the Congo shall be safe from all threats, foreign and domestic, as we strive to wipe away the black mark that has stained the FP’s reputation for decades."

LPD_nationalized_umhk:0 "Nationalized UMHK"
LPD_nationalized_umhk_desc:0 "For far too long has the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga controlled the economy of the Congo, selling off the riches and bounties of this land for their own profit while giving little to the Force Publique and the colonial government. This ends now, for the UMHK shall be shackled to the whims of the state. Through force and strong arming by means of gun-toting diplomacy, we shall effectively nationalize this monopoly by fully leashing it to our whim. Under this new arrangement, we will ensure we get our slice without leaving any room for error and without anyone else dipping into our profit margins."

LPD_working_with_industrialists:0 "Working with Industrialists"
LPD_working_with_industrialists_desc:0 "Though it may pain our administration to do so, we must negotiate with the greedy industrialists who have long lorded over the Congo’s economy. By reaching out to massive corporations like the Krupp-Mittelafrika and the UMHK and offering enticing arrangements, we shall strike a deal that profits both of our groups, allowing our own regime and these rabid capitalists to both pursue our own agendas without getting in each other's way."

LPD_broken_up_umhk:0 "UMHK Broken"
LPD_broken_up_umhk_desc:0 "The colonial monopolies of the Congo have long strangled any hope of a small business sector or any independent business at all developing. The massive conglomerates of the Congo, namely the UMHK, shall be shattered into smaller constituent business and sold off to the highest bidders - open to both African and Colonial buyers. To ensure some Africans get in on the action, certain auctions shall be Africa-only to ensure a Black business class begins to develop."

LPD_nationalized_umhk_kanza:0 "Nationalized UMHK"
LPD_nationalized_umhk_kanza_desc:0 "The UMHK accounts for over 70% of the Congo’s national economic output. A monopoly of this scale should have never been allowed to be created, and as such, we shall subsume this behemoth into the government in its entirety. With this conglomerate fully under the control of the Kanza regime, we can be sure any and all profits shall go directly to aiding the Congolese people on their road to independence."

LPD_miracles_idea:0 "Performing Miracles"
LPD_miracles_idea_desc:0 "The Ngunza is said to hold many powerful abilities and powers granted to him by God himself. As the Holy Spirit given flesh, he is able to see the future and commune directly with God and Jesus Christ, who grant him the ability to perform miracles. Able to cure the blind, deaf, and mute, treat any illness, and halt any disease, Kimbangu is as bonafide a miracle worker as the Son of God himself. With these powers, and with the help of the growing Congolese government under him, these miracles shall be made a reality on a national scale as we work to care for each and everyone of our people and deliver them from suffering."

LPD_cleansing_of_sin_idea:0 "Cleansing of Sin"
LPD_cleansing_of_sin_idea_desc:0 "To fall to sin and vice is a tale as old as time. Gambling, smoking, dancing, expressive singing, nudity, indecency, and more shall be banned and cleansed from our society as we embrace our Puritan roots. Only accepted forms of expression shall be allowed, such as the singing of hymnals and bathing while clothed, for without these guidelines our nation would surely fall back into chaos and crisis once more."

LPD_cleansing_of_sin2:0 "Cleansing of Sin"
LPD_cleansing_of_sin2_desc:0 "To fall to sin and vice is a tale as old as time. Gambling, smoking, dancing, expressive singing, nudity, indecency, and more shall be banned and cleansed from our society as we embrace our Puritan roots. Only accepted forms of expression shall be allowed, such as the singing of hymnals and bathing while clothed, for without these guidelines our nation would surely fall back into chaos and crisis once more."

LPD_congolese_identity_idea:0 "United Congolese Identity"
LPD_congolese_identity_idea_desc:0 "Simon Kimbagu has risen to become the true Father of the new unified Congolese identity. Under his watch, a cohesive Congolese culture has begun to blossom, centered around his church and his teachings. In the face of colonialism, our varied and numerous peoples persevered through Hell and back, and in the end have been rewarded with sovereignty and true national unity."

LPD_defend_the_city:0 "The Gem of the Vrijstaat"
LPD_defend_the_city_desc:0 "Whether you call it Leopoldville or Kinshasa, the varied people of this African metropolis have a great love for their city. As one of the largest cities on this continent, we rule over a vast amount of people but also have a massive amount of resources at our disposal. We must defend this gem of the Congo, no matter the cost, even as whispers of old foes surface among this chaos."

LPD_declare_independence:0 "The Declaration of Independence"
LPD_declare_independence_desc:0 "We have been cast adrift onto this sea of chaos that has replaced and consumed the once pristine and placid region of Congo. To consolidate our rule as we find our metropolis tossed into the role of a provisional government, we must issue a formal declaration of independence from the Congo colony. Under the leadership of General Armand Huyghé and the Force Publique, a new sovereign city-state shall rise here on Congo’s lone corridor to the sea. Whether you are a settler of Leopoldville or a Kinois of Kinshasa, we must band together as Congo falls to crisis!"

LPD_fate_of_the_north:0 "Fate of the Congo"
LPD_fate_of_the_north_desc:0 "To the East of our cosmopolitan haven, the rest of the Congo is embroiled in fierce war as mercenaries and natives rise against the colonialist machine. We must decide here and now what our policy towards these collapse-states shall be. Whether we soldier on to defend the colonial dream or decide to abandon our imperialism-born identity, we shall ever preserve this oasis of tranquility we have crafted."

LPD_unify_congo:0 "Congolese Unification"
LPD_unify_congo_desc:0 "The vast colonial apparatus that once ruled over this region we call Congo had long squandered their opportunity at creating a stable and cohesive nation. It falls onto us to crusade across the former lands of the Vrijstaat to create a truly pluralistic federation that can withstand the chaotic rigors of nation-building in Africa."

LPD_the_force_publique:0 "Free Reign of the Force Publique"
LPD_the_force_publique_desc:0 "The Force Publique has long served as the final line of defense between Congo and absolute chaos. Their oppressive but effective tactics are infamous throughout the colony, and despite their aging equipment and dwindling White officer corp, the natives in their employ make up for it with their savagery and tenacity. We must write a blank cheque to allow this last sword and shield of our safety free reign to do as they deem necessary to preserve our stability and safety."

LPD_support_the_government:0 "Recognize the Free State"
LPD_support_the_government_desc:0 "The Vrijstaat, or Free State, is the rightful Congolese government, and as such, our natural allies. Long has the city of Leopoldville served the Ryckmans Regime, and this cooperation shall continue. Our metropolis is the largest and most influential in all of Congo and serves as the colony’s only access to the sea; they simply can not survive without us, and we both know it."

LPD_rejoin_the_freestate:0 "The Question of Unification"
LPD_rejoin_the_freestate_desc:0 "Though our territorial extent is small, we are the bigger player in these coming negotiations. As the most important city and only seaport in all of Congo, the Ryckmans Regime will simply not survive without resources and opportunities that float into our harbor. We will approach them about unification, but if they choose to accept, we will hold their nation and all future ambitions of Congo by the balls."

LPD_team_switzerland:0 "Pledge Neutrality"
LPD_team_switzerland_desc:0 "To pick a side in this Congolese civil war would tear our nation apart. We must profess strict neutrality in this conflict as we work to secure our citizens from this maelstrom. We have far more important things to focus on instead of shooting our own countrymen in the mud."

LPD_be_nice_to_the_natives:0 "Metropolitan Cosmopolitanism"
LPD_be_nice_to_the_natives_desc:0 "Our fair city is massive, stretching across both sprawling urban and rural zones, holding thousands of souls and dozens of ethnic groups and minorities. We must account and care for each and every one of these groups, without favoritism, lest our entire city-state collapse into the same chaos that has befallen our fellow Congolese. All shall be welcome in our city limits as long as they abide by our rules."

LPD_defend_the_port:0 "The Mouth of the Congo"
LPD_defend_the_port_desc:0 "We control what may be the most important piece of infrastructure in all of Congo - the Port of Matadi. Connected to our fair metropolis with the Matadi-Leopoldville Railway, this harbor serves as the chief seaport for the entire Vrijstaat, or did before this violent collapse. We must defend the port at all costs, for without it, both Leopoldville and the entire Congo shall be sealed off from the wider world."

LPD_fortify_the_city:0 "From a City to a Fortress"
LPD_fortify_the_city_desc:0 "Our first and last stand against any enemy will likely take place at the gates of this city we call home, and as such, we must not allow it to fall. Leopoldville shall be transformed into an imposing and unassailable bastion. Walls shall be raised, bunkers and pillboxes constructed, and barbed wire and mines placed across our perimeter. Any foe wishing to take this city will have to crash through these defenses and cut us down to the last man."

##Huyghé Tree

LPD_hughyes_congo:0 "The Velvet Glove of the Chevalier"
LPD_hughyes_congo_desc:0 "Armand Huyghé has lead Leopoldville and the Force Publique through thick and thin, and has emerged from the other side of this calamity as the leader of the FP, continuing his role but now taking on the gargantuan task of administering not just a military force and a city, but an entire nation as well. Holding dear to the status quo while inching towards modernization and slightly more equitable policies, Huyghé shall be a stable and predictable leader for this post-Crisis Congo, seeking to strike a balance between colonial and native interests."

LPD_new_status_quo:0 "The New Status Quo"
LPD_new_status_quo_desc:0 "We have established our rule over all of the former lands of the Vrijstaat, and now we stand as the new masters of the wild lands of Congo. The Force Publique is still nominally in charge, and has now declared an intention to slowly return to civilian colonial rule. Embracing the ideas that saved our city and forged our new sense of unity, we shall spread these pluralistic principles to all people of the Congo as we struggle to repair the schism that caused the crisis we have endeavored through."

LPD_strike_a_balance:0 "Strike a Balance"
LPD_strike_a_balance_desc:0 "We must take a measured hand to our rule over this new Congolese state, for we are in untested waters. The refined Force Publique shall serve as the shepherds of this new nation, slowly building up the necessary bureaucracy and administrations needed to transition to a more permanent state in the far future. By balancing a need for stability with a desire for freedom and pluralism, the FP will attempt to lay the foundations of our new state."

LPD_promise_not_to_do_leopold_things:0 "Never Another Leopold"
LPD_promise_not_to_do_leopold_things_desc:0 "The horrors of the reign of King Leopold II are still fresh in the minds of all Congolese, especially the natives, forever scaring the image of colonial rule and sullying the word of Europeans in the minds of many Africans. We must make clear to our new populace that the madness of the Leopold regime will never be allowed to return to these lands, and that the remaining colonists and settlers are here to contribute to this new society as equally as their newfound countrymen."

LPD_democracy_in_quotation_marks:0 "A Budding ‘Democracy’"
LPD_democracy_in_quotation_marks_desc:0 "To make good on our promises, the Force Publique and General Armand Huyghé have decided to make way for ‘fair and free’ elections. Though only accepted, non-radical parties have been allowed to run and some rumors of tampering have circulated around, the FP assures us that this is truly the arrival of bonafide democracy here in Congo."

LPD_local_autonomy:0 "Tribal Autonomies"
LPD_local_autonomy_desc:0 "Within our borders exist many native kingdoms, chiefdoms, and barely-contacted tribes. In order to quell any potential unrest from these masses, we shall grant them large amounts of autonomy, giving them free reign to rule their own people as they please while nominally existing within our burgeoning federal structure. They will still be forced to pay some sort of tithe to our government like any of our citizens, but given their positions, monetary compensation is not always feasible or even the best option. Any groups that do not wish to or can not pay can instead offer their produced goods, manpower, or anything else, and in return, they can largely do as they please, so long as it does not interfere with our mission here."

LPD_congolese_federalism:0 "Congolese Federalism"
LPD_congolese_federalism_desc:0 "A true Congolese Federation once seemed like a fantasy, but now this idea can become a reality. Embracing our roots as cosmopolitan people in a massively diverse region, we shall attempt an experiment unlike any seen in Africa so far - a true democratic federation. Constituent ‘states’ shall range from autonomous kingdoms to newly created administrative provinces. Emulating larger nations such as the United States and the Kaiserreich, we will create a true, united federation of Congolese states, all under the colonial federal government."

LPD_allow_blacks_to_run:0 "Open the Government to Africans"
LPD_allow_blacks_to_run_desc:0 "The oppressive atmosphere of inequality that has long existed here in the Congo was one of the key reasons why the Vrijstaat fell and why our city almost fell victim to internal upheaval. To alleviate this long-building tension, we shall open up the colonial government to a small number of trusted native officials. Filling out the lower ranks within our bureaucratic hierarchy and within local government systems as administrators, liaisons, and nominal representatives, we shall throw the Africans a proverbial bone to sate their desire for self-rule as we continue to entrench our positions."

LPD_colonials_only:0 "Keep True to the Colonial Mission"
LPD_colonials_only_desc:0 "The continuation of the colonial project is paramount, and after the recent waves of chaos and internal turmoil emanating from the natives, many within the government are now wary of giving the Africans any taste of self-determination. We shall pander to these concerns of the colonial Old Guard and maintain the status quo of the Vrijstaat. Instead of emancipation, which would only lead to more chaos and uncertainty, we shall work to continue our imperialist endeavours without interference from the locals."

LPD_parliment_under_hughye:0 "A Guided Colonial Parliament"
LPD_parliment_under_hughye_desc:0 "With our regime restabilizing and our new frameworks put in place, the Congo is ready to return to ‘civilian’ rule. The colonial parliament shall be reconvened, with the Force Publique finally taking a step back from rule and ending the long-standing environment of martial law. However, though these colonial bureaucrats, businessmen, and nobles shall now be given the reins of power once more, returning the Congo to a far less military-orientated colonial administration, they still will be heavily shackled by the whims of Governor-General Huyghé, who shall still hold sweeping executive powers with the backing of the Force Publique."

LPD_fp_police_force:0 "Return to a Pure Police Force"
LPD_fp_police_force_desc:0 "The Force Publique was always intended to be a mere peacekeeping force here in the Congo, not the massive military behemoth it has become. We were meant to protect and serve this fair colony, not to burn and plunder its riches while we neglect the natives. Our duty is to protect and police the people within our colony, not wage war in foreign lands or oppress the very souls we are meant to safeguard. The Force Publique shall be expanded to all cities and townships within our colony, but minorly demilitarized to show our good faith in our new direction. To replace them, a new national army for the Congo colony shall be created from the ground up, incorporating African and Colonial tactics and components to serve as a new syncretic defense force of the nation. The growing pains from creating a new army from scratch will be immense, but the pain will be worth it in the end."

LPD_fp_military_force:0 "Evolve into a Full Army"
LPD_fp_military_force_desc:0 "Though the Force Publique was intended to be just a police force, it has since grown into something far exceeding this original purpose. This expansion and massive degree of militarization cannot simply be undone nor reversed, and so we must embrace it. The Force Publique shall become the official armed forces of the Congo, expanded and with the troops more thoroughly trained so that each and every new member can be held to the same high standards. Under the reformed Force Publique, the Congo shall be safe from all threats, foreign and domestic, as we strive to wipe away the black mark that has stained the FP’s reputation for decades."

LPD_allow_more_blacks_in_fp:0 "Raise Black Conscription Rates"
LPD_allow_more_blacks_in_fp_desc:0 "Whatever our policy and doctrine, one thing in warfare is for certain: we need bodies. The only way to defend our lands and to fight the wars of the future is if we have enough able-bodied men armed with the latest equipment to be able to fill our frontlines and foxholes. As a colonial administration thousands of miles from its nation of origin, the only way we are going to achieve this goal is by using more African conscripts in our ranks. The Force Publique has long used black soldiers, but they have been mostly kept from command and specialist positions. We must allow small numbers of Blacks into these ranks while massively opening the doors for African recruitment, for our army and our nation will not survive without it."

##Janssens Tree

LPD_little_maniac:0 "The Iron Fist of the Petit Maniaque"
LPD_little_maniac_desc:0 "Émile Janssens has risen through the ranks of the Force Publique, and, after proving himself capable of suppressing malcontent in this wild Congo, has been given complete command over both the Force Publique and the wider colonial apparatus as acting Governor-General Huyghé’s right-hand man. Under this Little Maniac, discipline and order shall be brought to the Congo from the hands of the colonials, and at the end of their barrels if need be."

LPD_crush_nationalists:0 "Crush Nationalist Movements"
LPD_crush_nationalists_desc:0 "Nationalism is a righteous and empowering idea - an idea respected by Janssens who have long espoused nationalist Flemish beliefs - but in the hands of these savages, it could prove to be our undoing. We must crush any and all native Congolese national movements and prevent a unified identity or bond from forming within the various groups outside the colonial system. Key figures in their national movement shall be arrested, and any who oppose shall be eliminated. While the Vrijstaat stands, any idea of a unified Congolese nation shall remain in the grave."

LPD_leopold_legacy:0 "Sire, ils Vous l'ont Cochonné"
LPD_leopold_legacy_desc:0 "’Sire, they’ve messed it all up.’ These words of our leader Commander Janssens echo through the minds of all true patriots and colonials, gnawing away at the back of our minds, for we know we have failed our true liege. Leopold II, may he rest eternally in peace, is rolling in his grace over our inability to manage the great Congo colony he built. This era of chaos, disgrace, and instability ends now!

Serving under Huyghé as his right-hand man and lead civilian figure in the nation, Kanza - a Force Publique veteran noted for being one of the FP’s only Black officers - was deemed by Huyghé and his council to be the perfect choice for a mediated push for slow decolonization in light of the recent chaos and backlash towards colonial rule.

leopoldville.0.d:0 "Peace has once more been restored to the Congo, and the bloodshed caused by the collapse of the colonial regime has ceased as we reassert control over the nation. Initially, our forces in the Force Publique only secured our beloved metropolis of Leopoldville to prevent the chaos from the jungles and wider Congo from getting inside, but upon seeing the insanity of the various Crisis factions, we had to sally forth and put a stop to them. Now we must see about creating a new regime to watch over these lands without a repeat of the exploitation and chaotic collapse of the previous governor, while still maintaining stability over all other concerns."
leopoldville.0.d.kimbangu:0 "We have won! The people of the Congo cheer with glee as our religious movement brings them salvation. The fires of conflict have ceased and now protection comes in the form of a Cross at the hand of the Ngunza Simon Kimbangu. We have come a long way, but we have managed to preach the word of the Lord and of Peace effectively enough that the bloodshed has finally ended. We have finally cast out those who had refused to stop exploiting the Congo and its people, and by doing so the Congo is once more at peace and colonial-free. Our people are scared and battered by war, with the conflict leaving many scars both physical and mental, but with Kimbangu bringing forth his faith to these newly baptized lands, we can ensure the Congo is a new holy land for the Black race."

Lying on the site of the old village of Kinshasa, which many native Congolese have co-opted as a nickname for the city, Leopoldville was first settled in 1881 and has since become one of the most important sites in the nation. With the German and Flandro-Wallonian mandate burning to ash and cinder, we have been thrust into the dark, isolated and cutoff from the rest of the Congo here on our only strip of Coast. With the Port of Matadi under our control, we have secured the only major seaport in the nation, and must use this as a lifeline until the terrible war is finished. \n\nThough the civilian council of the system is still in control in theory and the Ryckmans is still nominally in charge, in reality the Force Publique under General [LPD.getleader] rules over the city has and has enacted martial law. This military government now balances on a delicate edge between falling to the rising waves of unrest and anti-colonial sentiments and being conquered by the rebelling mercenaries and Congolese natives to the East. \n\nIf the residents of Leopoldville can survive this maelstrom without tearing the city apart, this cosmopolitan metropolis may just teach the rest of the Congo something about the benefits of cooperation. However, not all is as serene as it seems, as an old foe has broken out of their near 30-year prison sentence in Elisabethville as the region collapsed into war, and this old, infamous prophet has been seen slowly making his way back home. No matter the foe, domestic or foreign, this shining Gem of the Congo shall not falter!"

If we were to accept, we would be fully integrated back into their borders, though given autonomy and extra incentives and benefits for agreeing to holster our weapons for the good of our colonists and the Force Publique’s command structure.

leopoldville.6.t:0 "A Training ‘Accident’"
leopoldville.6.d:0 "Lieutenant-General Émile Janssens has long been a vocal and virulent advocate for colonial rule. Across his career, he has made a name for himself as a true disciple of Leopold II, acting as a harsh and oftentimes cruel, but undeniably effective military commander of the Force Publique. Often getting into rants about the Force Publique’s duty and the need for purity and separation, Janssens has come into the national spotlight recently over comments made during a training session at one of our army bases. Barking at black recruits over their inability to effectively lead troops with organization and discipline, a Kikongo trainee snapped and lurched at Janssens with his training-issued knife. Without hesitation, Janssens pulled out his MLE. 1903 and fired two rounds quickly through the skull of the charging brute. As his head began to spout blood and brains from the two exit wounds out the back of his skull, Janssens pulled out his neckerchief to wipe the soot and blood splatter from the barrel while remarking to the surrounding trainees that any of them could meet a similar fate at any moment - a hollow threat if not for the pistol in his hand and the six white officers standing behind him, each armed with their standard-issue FN Mle. 89/36 rifles. \n\nThe fallout of this event has pushed the Congo closer to collapse as the African ranks of the FP across the nation are in an uproar, clamoring for something to be done."

leopoldville.7.d:0 "As if the last incident was not bad enough, Émile Janssens has managed to get himself into even deeper trouble with the Africans within the Force Publique than ever before - no small feat after years of oppressive tactics and even after shooting one conscript dead. Janssens, in a meeting with hundreds of low-ranking Black NCOs and the White officer corp of the FP concerning the growing instability within the Force Publique and the wider Congo as a whole, managed to make the national situation worse by directly stating his intention to never allow Blacks within the commissioned Officer Corp of the FP. Doubling down, he has stated that even if colonial rule was to collapse, he would still rule the FP as dictated by his predecessors and by Leopold II, never allowing the African race to sully the purity of his precious paramilitary. \n\nThese comments have sent the nation into an uproar, and the African conscripts within the FP are frothing at the mouth in their anger over Janssesn callus comments. The various cliques within the FP’s lower ranks have banded together and sent an ultimatum to Janssens’ office today, demanding his immediate resignation, or else. Though this is likely a hollow threat, we must stay vigilant, for it seems the Congo is walking on a knife’s edge."

All of Leopoldville, once our shining and peaceful metropolis, has now fallen into utter chaos, with urban warfare and violent riots breaking out across the city. Even worse, it seems the mutiny and these following riots have been fueled by followers of the false prophet Simon Kimbangu, who has long been a thorn in the side of our mandate. With these religious fanatics working with the revolting FP soldiers, many fear that this crisis could spiral out of hand very quickly and spread throughout the Congo if we do not act quickly. However, despite the exponentially growing urgency of the matter, many within our regime are still hesitant to act, fearing further reprisals will only lead to further chaos. Ultimately, the choice is up to our acting leader Commander Huyghé."

Simon Kimbangu, the prophet, the Ngunza, the true preacher of God’s truths, and the physical incarnation of the Holy Spirit has parted the turbulent sea of chaos that has flooded Leopoldville, stepping forth as the savior of the Congo. Once imprisoned for his beliefs, he has since escaped and found vindication, now rising to lead all of Leopoldville with an army of followers at his side. With his ascension, the old colonial order and the Force Publique shall be cast out, deemed as heathens and heretics, and banished to Hell or the dark recesses of our primordial jungles while the true sons of the Lord revel in their new land of milk and honey. Under Papa Kimbangu’s pious, divinely-blessed rule, the Congo shall be transformed into the true Eden it was meant to be, for the Congo is the true birthplace of Christianity, the birthplace of Humanity, and now shall be the birthplace of Africa’s divine emancipation."

leopoldville.10.t:0 "The Fate of the False Prophet"
leopoldville.10.d:0 "With the mutineers either slain or jailed and the riots crushed, now comes the time to deal with the chief instigator of this chaos. Simon Kimangu, a nutjob and false prophet preying on the weak and feeble, or perhaps just feeble and deluded himself, has been captured by our forces at the Southern border of Baskongo where he was attempting to escape into Angola. Catching him in the act before he could make his border crossing, one of our local agents shot him in the thigh to prevent his escape, and we now have the deluded old fool in custody. With his arrest, we are now left with a choice. We can either repeat our past method and merely imprison him, this time in a more secure facility in our homeland of Flanders-Wallonia, ensuring his inability to influence Congolese affairs. Alternatively, we can just end this simply, here and now, and schedule Kimbangu a date with the hangman at once, ending the saga of the Ngunza once and for all."
leopoldville.10.a:0 "Simply return him to his old prison cell, under higher guard this time."
leopoldville.10.b:0 "He escaped death once, not again. Ready the gallows for their newest toy!"

leopoldville.11.t:0 "How to Temper the Will of the Lord"
leopoldville.11.d:0 "The holy Ngunza has begun to consolidate his rule, and the strength of his new faith, over our domain. With this consolidation, a final choice must be made on the direction of our new state. Simon Kimbangu has long been a largely apolitical figure, preaching the true Gospel as opposed to any ideology or political creed while willing to work with any and all of God’s children. \n\nThis lack of personal bias and openness to cooperate with all forces has led Kimbangu to having a massive array of varied allies and friends that would serve as ideal administrators and ministers to serve the Ngunza and help him rule over the vast expanse that is the Congo. \n\nKimbangu could work with ‘Nzerian’ figures such as Louis de Gonzague Bobozo and his young protege Joseph-Désiré Mobutu and other Congolese nationalists in the MNC and the ANC, cementing his status as the national father of the Congo and moving the nation in a minorly nationalist direction. On the far end of that spectrum, Kimbangu could instead reach out to old radical allies in French Congo, Angola, and Gabon, painting Ngunzism in a Red, or at least ‘pink’ light, adopting a form of Christian-Socialist teachings. However, if the Ngunza were to align with a true political party, his sons - all members of ABAKO themselves - urge Kimbangu to work with Joseph Kasa-Vubu and the Kongo-favoring Liberals. \n\nAlternatively, the Ngunza could take the nation in a far less polarized direction and instead focus solely on the One True Faith. Forming a council with his sons Joseph Diangienda, Charles-Daniel Kisolokeke, and most prominently Salomon Dialungana Kiangani, these four ‘Papas’ of the Congo would lead the nation in all matters political and spiritual, with a council of advisors aiding them. Taking this idea a step further, a more democratically-aligned group led by Jean Bolikango and Daniel Kanza seeks to utilize this system as well, but with the council of advisors being democratically elected Congolese who are pre-vetted by Kimbangu and his sons as pious enough to run for office. \n\nOpposing all of these ideas, or perhaps pulling the all together, is the final option. Drawing on all allies of Kimbangu, a union of his followers would be made under the Ngunza himself, with each faction having some minor say in government, but mostly serving as mere advisors. In this system, Kimbangu’s word, or perhaps more accurately the words of his sons through Kimbagu’s mouth, shall be law, and much of the nation shall remain as-is. Whatever system we settle on, we can be sure the world has never seen quite a system like it."

leopoldville.12.t:0 "A Daring Escape"
leopoldville.12.d:0 "With the chaos of the Congo Crisis rapidly unraveling, many regular administrative duties have fallen by the wayside as the frantic colonials desperately assemble their defenses for the coming Congolese tide and guerrilla attacks from the Mercs. From regular maintenance of simple infrastructure to most pressing matters like guarding the various mining outposts and prison camps have all fallen by the wayside as the Force Publique abandons their regular posts to fight on the disconnected and chaotic ‘frontlines’ of this horrific guerrilla conflict. \n\nOne such post being abandoned has been the Elisabethville Detention Camp, which has seen a marked drop in on-base staff and has been reduced to a skeleton crew. Worse for the local garrison still, the compound has been subjected to numerous raids from both Kivu revolutionaries and rogue mercenaries, as well as from resurgent Mwami loyalists sprouting out from the jungles. In one of the most recent attacks, a perimeter breach was made along the West wall of the prison, and 17 prisoners escaped into the night without a trace. \n\nNormally, such a small break out would not be cause for concern, for these prisoners have all barely eaten and will likely not survive in the wilderness unaided for long. However, one such escapee was none other than the infamous ‘prophet’ Simon Kimbangu - known for his mass of loyal followers and his insane beliefs that his is the Holy Spirit made manifest. Regardless, Kimbangu poses a direct threat to the future of colonial Congo, and some reports have already come in that this ‘Ngunza’ is already making his way back to Leopoldville to re-amass his following. Whether he shall be successful or simply lost to this chaotic maelstrom that is consuming the Congo, none can say for certain, but what is known is that the Ngunza walks free once again, and the Congo best be ready for his word."

leopoldville.14.t:0 "Where to Go from Here?"
leopoldville.14.d:0 "After untold bloodshed, horrific violence, and the complete collapse of societal order, the Congo has emerged from its civil war with colonial rule and the supremacy of the Force Publique just barely managing to stay intact. From this chaotic gauntlet, the Vrijstaat has reemerged under a new regime, one separate from the failings of Ryckmans and ready to lead the Congo in this new age. \n\nHowever, the goals, aims, members, and other specifics of this new regime have yet to be ironed out, and the Congo now stands at a crossroads. At the whims of Commander Armand Huyghé, the colonial mission here must now decide on how best to move forward. Long standing as a bastion of the status quo and as a moderate within the Force Publique, Huyghé stands as the ideal candidate to take over the role of Governor-General, where being an apolitical military man will limit the regime’s vulnerability to personal biases. However, choosing who shall rule alongside Huyghé has been rather difficult. \n\nCommander Huyghé could rule with his council at his side and with the shackled colonial parliament under him like the Ryckmans Regime before him, or he could take one of two more decisive directions. Émile Janssens, leader of the Force Publique under Huyghé and the cause of much of the unrest that sparked the Leopoldville Riots, Commander Janssens would be a controversial pick to be sure to serve as Huyghé’s Deputy Governor, but his military experience and veterancy in putting down the natives could prove useful. Going with such a known colonial hardliner and nationalist imperialist would certainly cement to all within the Congo that the Vrijstaat and colonial rule is here to stay. Alternatively, Huyghé could instead choose Daniel Kanza Kinsona, one of the few Black officers within the FP and a moderate democrat who only seeks to lessen the plight of his fellow Congolese. By going with Kanza, Huyghé would affirm to the world that decolonization is in the future for the Congo as he and Kanza slowly worked to create a true nation here in Africa’s Dark Heart and prepare it for the rigors of independent nationhood. Whatever Huyghé’s choice, he must make it carefully, for the lives of millions, both African and colonials, hang in the balance."

While staying at his quaint château outside Élisabethville during a weekend getaway in some vain attempt to escape the rigors of his long governorship, Huyghé was struck by stress-induced cardiac arrest, and died before his attendants even noticed he had gone quiet. \n\nWith this somber, and admittedly anti-climactic, death of such a storied figure of the Congo colony, the future of the Vrijstaat has been thrown into the abyss. Now, facing nothing but uncertainty and the unknown, Huyghé’s successor now must ready himself to take over as the new Governor-General of the colony as the honorable Chevalier de Mathenge is shipped back to his homeland to be honored by the state and buried at his family plot in Leuven.."

However, he has also gained the self-cultivated reputation as the ‘Petit Maniaque’, in reference to his short stature and ruthlessness when it comes to crushing the enemies of the Vrijstaat and his beloved Force Publique. Last serving under Armand Huyghé in Leopoldville within the local FP garrison, Janssens became more trouble than he was deemed worthy after his unceasing attacks against the natives and black conscripts within the FP caused riots and racial violence throughout the city. With the Crisis over and Leopoldville brought back into the fold, we have been sorely lacking in competent military staff, and many have begun to suggest we hire Janssens lest he go into retirement, or worse, leave colonial life behind to seek his own ambitions. Though this Little Maniac is truly a bloodthirsty madman, his military expertise cannot be denied. Should we move to transfer Janssens to our command, or shall we leave him to rot in infamy?"

Led by the strange holy man Simon Kimbangu, the Congo has been transformed into a strange but sin-free paradise, and now this Ngunza seeks to share his wisdom and prosperity with the rest of the Children of Africa. Calling his alliance the Fraternité Internationale du Salut Noir, or the International Brotherhood of Black Salvation, Kimbangu and his allies preach a peaceful, ascetic lifestyle to bring about true peace and prosperity for the Black race.

Tribal kings being praised by entire citie’s worth of natives as they are their new governors, boardrooms to decide the future of infrastructure now housing both Black and White members, and many more cases of blacks being involved in decision making and governance of their home area’s. It seems that in order to secure the stability of the Congo to prevent the collapse from ever being a possibility once more, Armand has seen fit to offer almost every major tribal leader or representative a chance to govern his province or be a part of the Congo’s decision making. Even those who have refused to join the colonial government have been given another offer, they can keep their tribes as separate entities in their own affairs and land, while still being able to send representatives to negotiate with the colonials. It seems the doctrine of governance has taken a new shift as they allow the natives vast amounts of say in the matter in order to keep a common stable ground."

Entering the base to meet their White trainers, as well as the single native NCO who would supervise them, they began their introduction to the FP, not paying attention as the pension was the only thing on their mind. \n\nAll around the Congo this sight is playing out, with native troops now in vast numbers alongside the colonials, while veterans that had been a part of the Force years ago now get to complete their retirement with pensions to farmstead promised to them by Armand."

King Leopold is simply regarded as a bad memory in the early days of colonization, and that the current colonials would not do heinous acts for profit, with those that do being given proper punishment. While most of these are genuine promises, only time will tell if they hold any actual sway in the wind, as so far the only change to actually occur from this is the establishment of military courts to punish those in the Force Publique that do commit atrocities."

These past missteps in policy are a thing of the past, for the Congo is under new management. With Emile Janssens - 'Le Petit Maniaque' - now at the head of the Congo, the White Man will finally shoulder his burden and lead, one way or another, the savages of the Congo to civilization at any cost.

While many believe our old regime in the Congo to be barbaric and cruel, Émile Janssens knows that Leopold II’s iron fist allowed the Congo to become bountiful and rife with resources. While many may call him mad, or Le Petit Maniaque, Janssens’s regime in Leopoldville has doubled down on exercising their power over their domain, giving the newly rejuvenated Force Publique wide sweeping powers over the small nation. Already, we have begun propaganda campaigns throughout Europe in order to draw more to our cause. While we do not need to fill their hearts and minds, we are able to fill their pockets and pride. By promising wealth and adventure, young men and seasoned officers alike are enlisting into our growing forces. With this new blood, enforcement has never gone better. Already, we are seeing the results of their increased usage, as our rubber quotas are being met with a sizable surplus, and the number of emboldened workers has gone down drastically.

Colonial settlement has once again picked back up in earnest, with ships full of fresh, White, Belgian faces arriving at the Port of Matadi by the day - each vessel; carrying a piece of our new future from the home country to our new domain here. With this renewed colonial spirit, we shall tame this wild hellscape known as the Congo and bring civilization to its Dark Heart, no matter the cost.

This new parliament will operate on a bicameral model, consisting of a Belgian upper house composed of Belgians tycoons, nobles, generals, and other colonials administrators and a lower house elected by direct universal suffrage by the land-owning male native people of the Congo.\n\nSome former Kivu revolutionaries and more radical Congolese independence fighters have criticized the creation of a colonial upper house, to which Kanza has replied that it is a necessary process for his slow decolonization project. Although some colonists are gnashing their teeth at the loss of their total control over the Congo, many are happy to have a house to represent them.

The Belgian Prime Minister opened the conference by specifying the will of his government as 'to lead, without fatal procrastination, but without ill-considered haste, the Congolese populations to independence in prosperity and peace'.\n\nDespite some inevitable disagreements between the two camps, a final consensus was promulgated following long and ardent negotiations. The Belgians recognized the fundamental rights of the Congolese people as well as the crimes they committed during the reign of the infamous King Leopold, and solemnly swore before the international community to gradually give full independence to the Congo in the years to come. The Congolese delegation has committed itself to treat well, without any discrimination, the European settlers of the Congo and to integrate them in the country while allowing them to keep their customs and tradition and has also committed itself to maintain strong friendly links with Brussels even when the decolonization process will be complete.

These reforms seem to be bearing fruit as we can observe the creation of a Congolese middle class for the first time in history, the quality of life of the people having clearly improved with the import of modern European technologies as well as a westernization of the Congolese way of life as Kanza had foreseen. We can also observe the multiplication of new and experienced native entrepreneurs and the creation of small Congolese businesses in place of the old colonial monopolies such as the Union Minière.\n\nAlthough many reforms remain to be done, our measures have proven to be effective and popular with both the Congolese and the Belgians, strengthening Kanza's position in the eyes of the Congolese and Belgians who still doubted him."

However, in this pocket, music has thrived instead of festering as creative minds work to create ever-more unique pieces and compositions with the limited ‘tools’ at their disposal. \n\nOne such example of this is the newest centerpiece of Congolese music - the Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste, or Kimbanguist Symphony Orchestra - has made quite the impression on both Papa Kimbangu and his millions of followers.

Despite this grand title, the realities of our nation’s current state and the infantile state of the orchestra are clear, for many of our players must use ex-colonial or makeshift instruments, sharing them frequently between the 12 inaugural members. Despite these humble beginnings, Papa Kimbangu and his son Joseph have been enamored by the OSK, with the two seeking any extra funds, however meager, to help fund this uniquely Congolese high art. Playing classical pieces accepted by the Ngunza as well as a wide range of religious music, the OSK has become the hit of the Congo, and from their small, shabby concert hall in Kinshasa, they attract crowds of thousands, all to the joy of our national father and his son."

Using Simon-Pierre Mpadi’s ‘Mission des Noirs’ as a foundation, our new militant force is now ready to defend Kimbangu’s Congo from any threat, both formal and domestic. \n\nCalled the Khakista, in reference to their khaki uniforms, this new guard is loyal only to the Ngunza, his three sons, and to Simone-Pierre Mpadi himself. Drawing inspiration from the short-lived ANC and the Force Publique, Mpadi has stripped away all the sin and violence that plagued the old armies of the Congo while keeping their tactics and professionalism, ensuring they are as capable and well-trained as any true army without the vile deeds that so frequently come attached. Under the watch of the Khakista, our new holy eden will be kept safe from the sinful devils that seek to undermine our pious kingdom of God."

Drawing strategies, tactics, and even operational guidelines from major Socialist nations across the world, these Holy Lions have morphed into a coherent militia force with elected officers and an emphasis on guerilla warfare.

leopoldville.32.d:0 "’Do not trust the White Man’s lies!’ These words echoed out across the crowd as the Ngunza, Papa Simon Kimbangu, delivered his sermon to the massive crowd that stood before him in his home-compound of New Jerusalem. From his lofty position atop the stairs that formed the front of his famed church, Kimbangu stood at the makeshift altar before him and prosthelytized the Truth of the Lord to his gathered flock. \n\nUttering his truths, the Ngunza exclaimed the true story of Christianity - for Jesus Christ was a Black Man, and the Ngunza knew this well. Eden as described in the bible is the primordial jungle we call the Congo, and all of Christianity’s earliest figures all hailed from our tropical paradise, for in these jungles, Christianity itself was born centuries ago. From the saints to Mother Mary to Jesus Christ and even God Himself, all within the Kingdom of Heaven that form the noble and holy pantheon of our faith looked like us, with skin like us. Black is beautiful, and Black is holy, for it is ordained by God. We are His children, subjects of the Lord’s unending quest to shepherd and guide humanity through sin and tribulation. We are His disciples, following His every command as we strive to create a better world, a Blacker world. We are His Chosen Ones, and this is the truth we all must follow! \n\nFinishing his sermon on the mount, the Nugunza then made his way down the steps before him and walked into the crowd as his adoring masses moved as if possessed by wild spirits. Dancing traditional Kimbanguist dances and exclaiming to the heavens as they jived and swayed, the Nugunza was swallowed by the mass of joyus parishioners and swept up into their faith-fueled frenzy. Connecting with his people, his flock, Papa Kimbangu and this crowd would spend the next few hours conversing, celebrating, and indulging their faith and spirituality as the crowd moved electrically to the words of truth their prophet had just spoken."

leopoldville.33.t:0 "Canonization of the Congo’s Heroes"
leopoldville.33.d:0 "To further the Africanization of the Ngunza’s syncretic Baptist and Puritan-esque new fath, he has called for a slew of honored Congolese heroes, both contemporary and from our past, to undergo the process of canonization, elevating these honored souls to rank of Sainthood. Old figures such as Kimpa Vita, the young prophetess that spread a religion very similar to Kimbanguism while suffering under the yoke of the Portuguese hundreds of years ago, to the first Christian manikongos of the old Kongo Kingdom, such as Afonso I and João I, shall be elevated to Sainthood along with many other figures from our past. As for more modern faces, each of Kimbangu’s three sons - Joseph Diangienda, Charles Daniel Kisolokele, and Salomon Dialungana Kiangani - are to be made Saints as well, joining their father in their upper hierarchy of the Christian faith, though still paling in comparison to Kimbangu’s grace as the embodiment of the Holy Spirit itself. Also of note is the decision to canonize Simon-Pierre Mpadi, Kimbangu’s loyal ally and right-hand man who has helped him build Ngunzism, or Kimbanguisim as it is increasingly being called, from the beginning. These righteous souls are free from sin and have each done much to bring the Congo to where it is today, and each shall be honored as such. Under their guiding watch and wisdom, our faith has never been stronger, nor more uniquely Congolese, further spreading the truth that Christianity started here in the Congo, and not in some desert hundreds of miles away."
leopoldville.33.a:0 "May their souls aid the Lord, helping Him and humanity along the way."

leopoldville.34.t:0 "A Call from Home"
leopoldville.34.d:0 "All throughout the wider world lies the great Diaspora of the African people. Be them decedents of slaves, stolen in the night and forced to labor for the White Devils, or "Free" Blacks, forced to suffer oppression for the sole fact of being a child of Africa. With the rise of the Ngunza, the end of that great Diaspora is finally insight. Using both our connections in the wider Pan-African movement and by the sole practice of his preaching, the Congo shall be transformed into a true homeland for all exiled Children of God that live outside our borders. Any Child that wishes to return shall, at our own expense, so that they can enjoy the true freedom, freedom from sin and vice, that is their birthright. While obviously this will be an expensive program, few are actually expected to make use of this offer. The Ngunza, for all his wisdom and Divine status, is not as versed in worldly affairs as his temporal representatives, who predict that while a small trickle of our brethren may return for years to come, the wave that Papa Kimbangu hopes for is unlikely to materialize.\n\nRegardless of the number of those who do return, the Congo truly is closer to becoming the Kingdom of God on Earth it was always meant to be."
leopoldville.34.a:0 "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path."

leopoldville.35.t:0 "A Puritan Congo"
leopoldville.35.d:0 "To cleanse sin from such a sin-soaked place as Congo is hard work, and the hardest of labors require the greatest sacrifices. Kimbangu’s gospel calls for a puritan, Baptist-influenced, and thoroughly Africanized regime free from earthly temptation. As such, his list of bans, taboos, and other forbidden fruits has been exclaimed to the public and passed into law immediately. Banning most music genres except classical pieces and religious compositions, dancing, drums, tobacco, alcohol, premarital sex, polygamy, witchcraft, violence and nudity in all forms, most holidays and other non-Kimbanguist observations and celebrations, and much more, the Congo has been turned into a puritan paradise overnight. \n\nHis loyal followers have been seen going village by village destroying drums, tribal fetishes, and sinful iconography across the nation while seizing wives from polygamous husbands, leaving them only with their first-wed wives, or in some cases, the wife of their choosing. Citizens are now required to wear special thin white robes even while have sex, swimming, or even bathing to hide the shame of Adam and Eve. New holidays celebrating the supposed date of Kimbangu’s birth, the formation of the nation, and the birth dates of each of Kimbangu’s three sons. Taking this a step further, Kimbangu, already the incarnation of the Holy Spirit, has created a new Trinity, consisting of the Papa Kisolokele as God the Father, Papa Dialungana as Jesus the Son, and Papa Kuntima as the Second Coming of the Holy Spirit who shall take Kimbangu’s place upon his passage into heaven, each being one of Kimbangu’s sons. With this new order established and with Kimbangu’s loyalists only growing in power, numbers, and zealotry, there is no doubt that these laws shall be upheld, for Papa Kimbangu and his sons decree it!"
leopoldville.35.a:0 "All sin and Earthy attachments that would chip away at our faith must be cast out."

leopoldville.36.t:0 "A Kimbanguist Thanksgiving"
leopoldville.36.d:0 "Though the idea of a ‘Thanksgiving’ is foreign to Kimbangu, he has nonetheless latched onto this odd, American-made holiday. Seeking to use it as a perfect and peaceful feast to break bread with the various religious leaders of the world, despite only recently learning about it from his correspondence with Clarence Picckett, famed Quaker and humanitarian from New England. Sending out invitations to famed theologians, preachers, and religious leaders from every corner of the world, Kimbangu was even ballsy enough to invite the Pope himself, despite Kimbangu’s attitudes to this White Man who claims to commune with God. However, despite hundreds of invitations being sent out, only four souls were brave, curious, or faithful enough to actually fly to New Jerusalem to feast with the Ngunza. \n\nArriving at his compound one by one, each with a small entourage for protection, Kimbangu’s guests marveled at the holy city Kimbangu has been slowly building here in the Congo. Among them was Clarence Pickett who came with his own good friend and fellow American theologian William Dudley Pelley. In stark contrast to these two, Kimbangu’s other guests were famed Black American preacher and prophet Father Divine, and the infamous yet devout François Duvalier, who, despite following Vodou, still is considered a honorable Christian due to Vodou’s roots as a syncretic mix of African Vodun and Chrisitanity. \n\nThese four titans of faith began their feast in earnest, eating and conversing the finer points of faith, religion, and sin, well into the night. As the night drew longer and the first awkward tensions eased, the five holymen grew close together, each seeing a sort of kindred spirit in each other not seen elsewhere before. Great conversation and debate was had, and each of them showed off their talents and knowledge on theology. Father Divine and Kimbangu even got into an argument of sorts over who embodied the Holy Spirit more, with both men claiming to form a piece of the Holy Trinity - though thankfully for them, their new friendship was kept intact due to a wise intervention from Pickett who tried his hardest all dinner to keep the peace. Of course, however, no night with the famed Pelley could end without him showcasing his famed ability to levitate, or without Papa Doc weaving vibrant tales of his unearthly powers given to him by Baron Zamedi and the other Haitian Loa. After a long night of feasting and discussion, the honored guests each began their leave, but not before Kimbangu made them each promise to come back again next year for another Thanksgiving feast, this time hoping to have them bring their families so that the bonds of friendship and comradery could grow ever closer. Never before had such a strange assortment of different Christian figures been held, especially within the Congo, but the dinner went off without a hitch, and proved to be a lovely event for all involved."
leopoldville.36.a:0 "What a lovely, if strange, dinner. Can’t wait until the next one!"

leopoldville.37.t:0 "Towards New Jerusalem"
leopoldville.37.d:0 "As our beloved Papa Kimbangu continues to spread his message and the True Gospel of Christ, it is becoming more and more clear that we need a capital, a city to symbolize the perfection of the Gospel and to act as an administrative center, and this is needed more now than ever. Be it the roving bands of mercs, remnant askari fighters or even the odd colonial hold out, the lands of the Congo have never been more dangerous, and while precautions have been duly imposed, both our Divine Leader and his temporal representatives have agreed more must be done. To this end, the greatest architectural minds of the Congo have been called to Papa Kimbangu's compound in Nkamba, just a few miles outside Kinshasa, to help in the planning and construction of a truly fitting capital for the Kimbanguist movement. \n\nWhile still proudly in the planning stages with only limited construction begun, the land surrounding Papa Kimbangu's compound has already been radically transformed, and the future site of what has been dubbed New Jerusalem is already taking shape.  Taking inspiration from many sources, everything from Rome to Jerusalem's old city, a more fitting religious capital there will never be. The primary center price of the capital is to be a massive and glorious church, nearly the size of the Colosseum, that is to be both the primary residence of Papa Kimbangu, when he isn't making his prearranged speeches, as well as the primary worship center for the movement as a whole. Also within the city is to be 1:1 replicas of famous sites within Christendom. Be it the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem where it is said that Christ was crucified, died and was resurrected, Ethiopia's Church of the Tablet where the Ark of the Covenant is said to be held or even Rome's St Paul’s Cathedral, for outside those infamous walls was where Paul was killed by the Romans, New Jerusalem will have it all. Obviously, all of this will take time, by some estimates up to 50 years, the very fact that the Kimbanguist movement finally has a home it can be proud of."
leopoldville.37.a:0 "A home at last!"

leopoldville.38.d:0 "Whether it be from the stress of ruling over this Eden, or antagonized by his previous time in prison thanks to the dastardly Flandro-Wallonian colonials, Papa Simon Kimbangu has begun to fall ill. However, due to his fanatical devotion to his own tenets and to traditionalist ways, he has refused any and all modern medical treatment, instead only using prayer, faith, and traditional health remedies of the local Kikongo to calm his symptoms. Though many respect his piety, his wife, his sons, and his closest confidants have begun to worry for his health, continually urging him to receive proper and modern medical treatment so that the Church does not lose its Father, and so the Faith does not lose its incarnation of the Holy Spirit. In the end, it is up to Kimbangu himself."

leopoldville.38.b:0 "A true Kimbanguist would reject these measures. We shall put our faith in God."

leopoldville.39.t:0 "The Death of the Father"
leopoldville.39.d:0 "Heaven shakes and angels cry, and all across our Eden weep, for the Father, the embodiment of the Holy Spirit itself, and the ‘Papa’ of our beloved Church, the Ngunza Simon Kimbangu has tragically passed away. Dying in his sleep peacefully after a long bout with disease, and surrounded by his wife and sons, the Prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ on Earth by His special envoy Simon Kimbangu has left this earth, and now passes through St. Peter’s gates into the Kingdom of Heaven, and is to be interred in a mighty mausoleum in Nkamba, or New Jerusalem, fitting of his grace. In his absence, a new face of the Kimbanguist Church and of our Spiritual Eden of the Congo must be decided, but who? \n\nThe obvious options, and those supported by Papa Kimbangu himself, were to be one of his three sons, or his wife if his sons were not yet ready to handle the burden of leadership. The eldest son is Charles Daniel Kisolokele. Born in 1914, he is seen as the embodiment of God the Father from the Holy Trinity, and is a known spiritual healer. The second son is Salomon Diangani Dialungana Kiangani, born in 1916 and seen as the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, standing as the second pillar of the Holy Trinity. The youngest but most dominant son however is Joseph Diangienda Kuntima, who is seen as the second human form of the Holy Spirit after his father Kimbangu, and has been the leading figure in the Church under the direction of his father. However, all three of his sons are still young, and so many support the idea that Kimbangu’s widow, ‘Mama’ Marie Muilu Kiawanga Nzitani should rule until her own passing, or until the time her sons can lead in her stead. Seen as the second coming of Saint Mary, mother of Jesus Christ, she is the most beloved and widely-respected figure in our Eden after Kimbangu himself, and would stand as a shining unity candidate and guiding light in these dark times. \n\nHowever, his long-time ally and sometimes rival Simon-Pierre Mpadi has aspirations of leading the Church himself. Once a member of the Congolese branch of the Salvation Army, he leads the Mission des Noirs, or Khakista, subfaction within the Church and claims to be the reincarnation of Saint Peter himself. Seeking to create the Eglise des Noirs Afrique, or the Church of Black People in Africa, Mpadi is a non-violent and pious but conniving and ambitious figure, and many would not put it past him to try to claim the Church’s vacant seat. In the ensuing days, a choice must be made, and so the next head of the Kimbganguist Church of Jesus Christ on Earth shall be..."

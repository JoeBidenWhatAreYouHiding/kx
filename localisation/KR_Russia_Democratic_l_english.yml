rusdeminfo.10.t:0 "RSDRP: 1917-1923"
rusdeminfo.10.d:0 "During the elections to the Constituent Assembly, the Mensheviks took second place. Having become the main party fighting for the rights of the proletariat in the absence of the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks under the leadership of Yuliy Martov became a major proletarian party. However, in view of the key differences between Martov and Kerensky, the latter preferred a coalition with the Kadets, confirming Milyukov as prime minister. The Mensheviks, however, continued to cooperate with the government and were not in the full sense an opposition party, since Kerensky understood the importance of the workers' question and approved many Menshevik reforms.\n\nEven in the first years of republican rule, the split in the Menshevik party was obvious. On the one hand, there was a large faction of internationalists led by Martov, who had the greatest popularity. The victory of the proletarian revolution in France greatly strengthened their position. They were joined by a more radical group of internationalists, who had previously collaborated with the Bolsheviks, led by Lozovskiy. Having previously created a separate party, by 1920 this group had merged back into the Mensheviks. On the other side was a group of right-wing Mensheviks, headed by Askelrod. Their program did not presuppose an alliance with the communards, but a bet on the bourgeoisie and reform. However, Martov, who fell ill with tuberculosis in 1920, gradually withdrew from the leadership of the party, and his place as leader was taken by Rafail Abramovich, Deputy Chairman of the Central Committee of the RSDRP, a member of the Bund."

rusdeminfo.11.t:0 "RSDRP: 1923-1928"
rusdeminfo.11.d:0 "In 1923, Martov died of tuberculosis, in connection with which a New congress of the RSDRP was convened, which was once again won by the Internationalists, who were now led by Abramovich. During this period, a Bloc of New Bolsheviks, led by Bukharin and Rykov, also emerged, who managed to win over a part of the peasantry and the proletariat. However, the position of the Mensheviks was strengthened during the successful British Revolution of 1925, and the party leadership participated in the creation of the Third Internationale. This activity alarmed the more moderate Mensheviks, who still remembered Bolshevism perfectly well and were inclined to cooperate with the liberal parties and Socialists-Revolutionaries. Open cooperation with the Communards complicated the relations of the Mensheviks with the ruling parties, and the rhetoric of the Mensheviks gradually changed in the direction of sharply criticizing Kerensky and the Kadets.\n\nThe reform of the Senate in 1925, the radicalization of society and the emergence of the NRPR strengthened the position of Askelrod and the right-wing Mensheviks, who believed that the weakening of the Kerensky regime would only lead to the strengthening of the radicals and the fall of democracy. In 1927, the right-wing Mensheviks seized the initiative and began to dominate the Central Committee, and after the elections to the Duma, Askelrod was elected the new chairman of the party.\n\nAskelrod did much to rally the party and by the time of his death in 1928, the party was once again united and internal party differences were no longer so strong. The new leader of the party was Potresov, one of the founders of the party and a supporter of reformism."

rusdeminfo.12.t:0 "RSDRP: 1928-1936"
rusdeminfo.12.d:0 "Potresov, as the head of the party, established contacts with the Socialists-Revolutionaries and Kadets and became their close ally. Under his auspices, the party became a key agitator of workers' rights, and many Mensheviks were appointed to key positions, and most of the trade unions, including the VTsSPS, the organisation of Russian Trade Unions, became controlled by the Mensheviks.\nDespite his distrust of Bukharin, Potresov, like the rest of the leaders of the socialist parties, generally considers the creation of a homogeneous socialist government in an emergency, although this will not be an easy decision for the party."
rusdeminfo.12.a:0 "Cool"

rusdeminfo.13.t:0 "PSR: 1920-1927"
rusdeminfo.13.d:0 "The Socialist-Revolutionary Party has been the ruling party for the past 15 years. Nevertheless, most of the party's program was considered too radical by President Kerensky, who continued to remain a nominal member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.\nAt the same time, the leader of the PSR, Viktor Chernov, remained in the shadows most of the time, being the speaker of the State Council until 1925, when it was transformed into the Senate, and then the speaker of the Duma until 1927, when he became a minister without portfolio. Chernov considered Kerensky only as an opportunity to promote Socialist-Revolutionary reforms and was always more inclined to ally with the Mensheviks than with the Kadets.\n\nDuring the first term of the SR-Kadet coalition and President Kerensky, the Social Revolutionaries lobbied in every possible way for a land reform that could solve the peasant question once and for all. However, the adoption of the law on the socialization of land was postponed in every possible way as well and in the end was only half adopted, leaving land in large cities and nearby provinces under private control. The unfinished land reform became a stumbling block in the relations between Chernov's centrist SRs and Kerensky's right SRs, hindered the stability of the government and reduced the popularity of the SRs and the president among the population. As a result of the unsuccessful reform, the dissatisfaction with the leadership of the party led to the emergence of new internal party factions: the center-left Volsky and Gerstein, who called themselves MPSR (The Minority of the PSR), whose positions were very close to the Left SR, but still rejected revolutionary socialism; and Savinkov, who managed to establish an entire right-wing party of ex-members of SRs, whose ideological position was further to the right."

rusdeminfo.14.t:0 "PSR: 1927-1936"
rusdeminfo.14.d:0 "The second term of the SR-Kadet coalition passed the same way as the first, but it was overshadowed by the strengthening of the power of the Senate, the economic crisis and German control. Kerensky's cooperation with the Senate and the Germans contributed to the deterioration of the popularity of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, as well as the final break between Kerensky and Chernov.\n\nThe elections of 1932, both presidential and parliamentary, marked the beginning of the end of the long rule of the SR-Kadet coalition and Kerensky. The Socialist-Revolutionaries lost the Duma elections of 1932, losing the majority to the NRPR, and only an electoral and parliamentary coalition with the Kadets saved them from a final loss. Starting in 1932, the legislation against opposition parties and assemblies was sharply tightened, largely due to Kerensky's fears about the activities of Savinkov and the NRPR, and by the beginning of 1936, attempts were made on many high-ranking officials, including Kerensky himself. Despite all of the above, there are still those in the Socialist-Revolutionary party who see the future of the party in cooperation with the Kadets, as well as those who are more inclined towards Savinkov."

rusdeminfo.15.t:0 "KDP: 1920-1925"
rusdeminfo.15.d:0 "The Party of Constitutional Democrats (Kadets), whose main electorate was liberal-minded landowners, industrialists, merchants, bankers, teachers, doctors, employees and intellectuals, took third place during the elections to the Constituent Assembly, thus becoming the only major non-socialist party. Already since 1920, the Kadet party has united various factions, which can be divided into Milyukov's centrist Kadets, Nekrasov's left Kadets, Progressives who joined the party, Nabokov's right Kadets, as well as individuals who supported Kolchak and were in his government. In addition, the party was conditionally divided into supporters of the republic and the monarchy.\n\nAfter the Constituent Assembly and the restoration of the republic, a number of programmatic and tactical issues somewhat diverted the various currents in the party from each other. In the end, the victory was won by the centrists of Milyukov, who was elected Prime-Minister in the Kerensky government.\n\nIn 1925, during the Kolchak putsch, many cadets, especially regional officials, went over to his side, and as a result founded their own party, known as the "Kadets of the Far-East", and in the Russian Republic the SR-Kadet coalition consolidated its power, which was destined to last for another 10 years."

rusdeminfo.16.t:0 "KDP: 1925-1936"
rusdeminfo.16.d:0 "By 1936, the situation of the Kadets was not the best. The obvious failure of the SR-Kadet coalition and Kerensky, the unsuccessful reforms and the growing popularity of radical parties raises the question of the complete disappearance of the party. In addition to external threats, there are also internal ones. Pavel Milyukov refuses to nominate his candidacy for the post of Prime-Minister, and more and more the initiative in the left wing goes to Nikolay Nekrasov, who supports the resumption of the coalition with the revolutionary democrats (Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks), as well as strengthening the power of the Duma.\n\nOn the other hand, the power in the right wing belongs to the elderly Vladimir Nabokov, who still supports the restoration of the monarchy and an alliance with the conservatives. But if he fails in his endeavors, it is quite likely that Alexander Konovalov, who stands for a strong presidential power and tries to unite former Progressives into a new party of the bourgeoisie and entrepreneurs, will occupy the power vacuum."

rusdeminfo.17.t:0 "VNS: 1921-1925"
rusdeminfo.17.d:0 "The history of the All-Russian National Union began long before 1921, when in 1908 such a party was first created and united moderate-right politicians. Russian Russians who "belong to the indigenous Russian population or have organically merged with the Russian people"could become members of the VNS. Soon Vasily Shulgin, a well-known Russian nationalist, but of a progressive persuasion, joined the Union, who actually became the main speaker of the party and will still play a significant role in it.\n\nAfter the February Revolution, like other right-wing and monarchist parties, the VNS was banned, and was revived by the forces of Shulgin and Dmitry Romanov shortly after the second Constituent Assembly and the proclamation of Russia as a democratic federal republic. Having united all the right-wing, conservative and monarchist parties, the VNS soon became the main stronghold of the right in the new Russia.\n\nNot enjoying popularity among the general population, the main electorate of the VNS was mainly representatives of large capital, monarchical circles and conservative intellectuals. The number of seats in the Duma of the VNS has never exceeded 30 people. Everything changed in 1925, when Kerensky reformed the State Council and changed the electoral quotas, which allowed the Conservatives to gain a majority in the upper house of parliament by 1934. Dmitry Romanov became the Speaker of the Senate, and the Senate itself regularly re-elected Kerensky for a new term."

rusdeminfo.18.t:0 "VNS: 1925-1936"
rusdeminfo.18.d:0 "In the hope of reducing dependence on German capital, it was the senators-members of the VNS who proposed to Kerensky to begin a policy of protectionism aimed at developing domestic production. The state reduced trade with Germany, which in the short term led to a rapid growth of industry, but soon turned into a failure due to a reduction in important supplies of German equipment. This policy eventually led to the closure of most German enterprises and increased unemployment.\n\nHowever, nevertheless, the conservatives retained power in the Senate, and, moreover, they did not abandon the policy of protectionism, making it their central core of the economic program. Despite the seemingly unbreakable unity of the party, like other political parties, it is fragmented.\n\nThe two leading players in the VNS are Vasily Shulgin and Dmitry Romanov. The first, the formal leader of the party, advocates the restoration of the monarchy in a constitutional or semi-constitutional style, trying to achieve a referendum and nominate his candidate, who does not necessarily turn out to be from the Romanov dynasty.\nThe second, the speaker of the Senate and the acting acting president, rather has more selfish goals in strengthening his personal power, whether it is monarchical in connection with his quite legitimate claims to the throne, or republican as the head of an authoritarian aristocratic republic.\n\nHowever, there is also a third player in the VNS, Felix Yusupov, a close associate of Romanov, who sees the future of the country not in the expansion of the power of the aristocracy, but rather of the oligarchy and big capital - after all, having such associates, many roads will open up for Yusupov."

rusdeminfo.19.t:0 "EP: 1922-1925"
rusdeminfo.19.d:0 "The history of the Eurasianist Party begins in 1922, when several representatives of the intelligentsia, namely the linguist Nikolai Trubetskoy, the geographer and economist Pyotr Savitsky, the historian and religious thinker Georgy Florovsky, published a collection of articles entitled \"Exodus to the East. Premonitions and achievements. The approval of the Eurasianists\". Already in 1923, the Eurasianist Book Publishing House was created, which began to produce a program almanac of Eurasianists, as well as books of its leaders. In the same year, the Eurasianists are trying to get into politics for the first time by creating their own party, and also established ties with many prominent Russian cultural and scientific figures. By 1925, many prominent scientists G. V. Vernadsky, R. O. Yakobson, L. P. Karsavin, D. P. Svyatopolk-Mirsky, as well as the composer Stravinsky joined Eurasianism.\n\nThus, when the reform of the Senate was carried out, the Eurasianist party was already represented at the early senate elections and even managed to get several mandates."

rusdeminfo.20.t:0 "EP: 1925-1936"
rusdeminfo.20.d:0 "§PNOTE: One or more subjects within this article are under rework, and may no longer be accurate§!\nSince 1925, the popularity of the Eurasianists has been growing rapidly, due to the participation in the activities of the party or cooperation with it of many famous Russian people, and the idea of Eurasianism is closely intertwined with anti-German sentiments in society. The attractiveness of the idea of \"rejecting Europe\", as well as the positioning of the Eurasianists as a revolutionary movement, resonated with many right-wing and conservative-minded masses, in fact, thus taking away almost the entire Republican electorate of the National Assembly.\n\nIn 1932, the Eurasianists were able to gain 4% in the Duma elections and get 22 seats, becoming the smallest faction in the parliament. Nevertheless, Kerensky, in order to ensure his power, appointed 16 Eurasianist senators out of 50 presidential senators, mostly representatives of aristocratic circles.\n\nHowever, by 1936, ideological differences had emerged even in the Eurasian Party. In addition to the "Center" of the party, the so-called Council of Three: Trubetskoy, Savitsky and Vernadsky, the party demonstrates a clear left bias in Mirsky's views, looking for Eurasian roots in Narodism. In addition to the left bias, there is a slight right bias: the marginal national-maximalist party of Prince Shikhmatov-Shirinsky, although ideologically associated with Narodism, but more nationalistic, and therefore politically adheres to the alliance with Boris Savinkov...\nIn addition, there are politicians in the Central Committee of the Eurasianist Party with their own personal views on the development of Eurasianism: Jacobson, who promotes social-democratic ideas in Eurasianism; Tyrkova-Williams, who supports the liberalization of the regime and the access of the broad masses to Eurasianism; Chkheidze, who supports the creation of a Eurasianist monarchy.\n\nThus, the party is really divided. But so far, these differences are not so obvious, but they will clearly surface as soon as the Eurasianists come to power."

rusdeminfo.21.t:0 "NRPR: 1924-1932"
rusdeminfo.21.d:0 "Kerensky's second term was overshadowed not only by Kolchak's campaign, but also by the growth of radicalism in society, the creation of new parties and organizations that demanded radical changes. The New Bolsheviks bloc, created by Rykov and Bukharin, took shape into a political party, the NSP, and began to promote its ideas of a gradual transition to socialism. And after the Kolchak coup and the loss of the Kuban and Eastern Siberia, in the wake of anti-German sentiments, Boris Savinkov, one of the prominent leaders of the SRs, a terrorist and revolutionary, defender of the peasants and vigilant anti-Bolshevik, creates a huge bloc of right-wing Republican parties - the People's Republican Party of Russia.\n\nFor the first years Savinkov worked to tear the Right SRs away from Kerensky. Using Kerensky's "cowardly" policy and an alliance with the increasingly syndicalist Left SRs, Savinkov was able to convince them to join a coalition with him. However, Kerensky quickly understood this game, and began to strengthen the role of the Senate, appointing moderate conservatives there who would ensure his eternal presidency.\n\nIn 1927, the first elections were held with the participation of the NRPR, and the party immediately managed to win almost 19%, receiving 118 Duma mandates. Savinkov gained access to the Duma, and often spoke from the rostrum as an opponent of Kerensky, Socialist Revolutionaries, liberals and monarchists, preparing to take the place of prime minister by 1932.\n\nHis plans were hindered by several facts: firstly, the PLSR left the coalition with the NRPR, annoyed by Savinkov's even if not chauvinistic, but rather nationalist rhetoric, and the cult of personality that had developed within the party. Secondly, the PSR-KDP pre-election coalition has once agained won the majority, though separately they would have definetely lost to Savinkov."

rusdeminfo.22.t:0 "NRPR: 1932-1936"
rusdeminfo.22.d:0 "Realizing the power of his influence, Savinkov began to actively promote his own ideas. Being a revolutionary and a supporter of terrorism, he creates a paramilitary wing of the party - the Combat Organisation of the NRPR (BO-NRPR). The actual declaration of war was the violent police dispersal of an anti-government demonstration of People's Republicans on the anniversary of the February Revolution in 1934.\n\nBy 1936, the 'Vozhd' was able to rally the entire revolutionary and protest electorate, and his victory in the next elections, if not unconditional, is very likely."
rusdeminfo.22.a:0 "What about Solidarists?"

rusdeminfo.23.t:0 "NSNP: 1930-1936"
rusdeminfo.23.d:0 "The National Union of the New Generation is a political party that emerged from the organization "National Union of Russian Youth" in 1930, when the Central Committee was formed and the party charter was adopted. A new principle was also introduced into the Charter of the NSNP — the age limit. Now only those born after 1895 could enter the Union. The age limit, according to the members of the Union, was supposed to protect the organization from "the sins and prejudices of the past," that is, from the influence of old party figures, who were partly blamed for the tragedy of Russia.\n\nIf we talk about the ideological foundation of the NSNP, it arose on the ruins of the Civil War, rabid anti-communism and anti-socialism, and was only reinforced by the unsuccessful reforms of Kerensky. In contrast to socialism and war, the young guys of the NSNP put forward the idea of solidarity and unity of Russian society, which they made the main motto of the party, and from where they got their fame as "Solidarists". However, when in 1931 the Solidarists began to prepare for the Duma elections, they found out that they had too few levers to get into parliament. Therefore, Viktor Baidalakov, the party leader, decided to join the coalition bloc of Savinkov's NRPR. This alliance allowed the Solidarists to get into parliament, but at the same time put them in a state of dependence on the NRPR and Savinkov's authority, as a result of which the Solidarists were actually eclipsed by the People's Republicans.\n\nDespite the fact that formally all Solidarists are also members of the NRPR, this alliance is fragile. Savinkov's NRPR is seen by Solidarists as a socialist party uniting radical right-wing social revolutionaries, which is partly true, and is reflected in some program points, while the NSNP opposes the generalization of property in any form. However, the parties have many similarities, namely, Russian nationalism and hatred of the Bolsheviks, syndicalists, and other openly socialist movements.\n\nIf Savinkov's party loses the elections or loses significant public support, it is quite possible that the Solidarists will start their own game. And they have every chance to win."

rusdeminfo.24.t:0 "NSP: 1920-1927"
rusdeminfo.24.d:0 "When the Red Army and the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR capitulated in 1920, most of the Bolsheviks, who were not arrested, left for Revolutionary France to establish the Bolshevik government-in-exile. However, the humiliated and weakened party was split and devastated. The new leader of the Bolsheviks after Lenin's death, Grigory Zinoviev, professed the Leninist ideology of the dictatorship of the party, and, it would seem, absolutely did not want to admit the failure of this idea, even being in a Commune, where a much more democratic syndicalism prevailed. Against this background, the right wing took shape in the RKP, which relied on the support of the peasantry, not the proletariat, and proposed the idea of a gradual transition to socialism. The leaders of this wing were Nikolay Bukharin and Aleksey Rykov. The split reached its apotheosis in 1921, when Bukharin and Rykov, as well as a number of their associates, left the party, and having agreed with the Kerensky government, arrived in Russia, publicly disavowing ties with former party members.\n\nAlready in 1922, in the wake of small peasant uprisings against Famine, the occupation of the Far East by Japanese imperialists and the East Karelian Uprising, Bukharin and Rykov undertook the creation of an organization called the New Bolsheviks Bloc. The Russian government distrusted this organization and strictly controlled it so that it could not take shape into a new political force.\n\nHowever, the Kerensky regime was still too weak and in 1924, a few months before Kolchak's coup, the New Bolsheviks Bloc was transformed into the People's Socialist Party, occupying an empty niche of left-wing non-parliamentary parties. However, the party was not particularly popular, largely due to the image of Bukharin and Rykov as former Bolsheviks, and in 1927 could not overcome the 5% barrier to parliament." 

rusdeminfo.25.t:0 "NSP: 1927-1936"
rusdeminfo.25.d:0 "Kerensky still saw the NSP as a threat and, having strengthened his own power, he decided to ban the activities of the NSP, forcing Bukharin to go underground. In 1930, when the Russian economy fell again, and Kerensky begged for German loans, the popularity of radical parties increased dramatically. After the ban, the NSP began to actively promote anti-German and anti-Kerensky slogans.\n\nAfter the elections of 1932, the NSP began to establish ties with revolutionary socialist parties, primarily with the Left SRs, and near-revolutionary ones, including the left Mensheviks and center-Left SRs, insisting on the creation of a homogeneous socialist government from a plurality of parties and the transition to a system of Soviets.\n\nOf course, there were serious contradictions between the NSP and other socialist parties, the main one of which was the economic program. The "New Economic Policy" proposed by Bukharin in 1933 became the main cause not only of discord between the socialist parties, but also within the NSP. As a result of the new economic program, the NSP became the only one of all the left-wing parties that considered private ownership of land, albeit temporary, but a necessary measure. The fact that the peasants will be able to extract profit from the land has inclined a sufficient part of the electorate to the side of the NSP. At this time, a wing of trade unionists, inspired by the successes of the syndicalists and focused more on the working class, under the leadership of Mikhail Tomsky, ideologically took shape within the party.\n\nNow that the ban on the political activities of the NSP has been lifted and they can participate in the elections, only a coalition with other socialist parties can help Bukharin lead the Popular Front."

rusdeminfo.26.t:0 "PLSR: 1920-1925"
rusdeminfo.26.d:0 "The Party of the Left Socialists-Revolutionaries in 1920 was on the verge of extinction. First the allies of the Bolsheviks, then their sworn enemies, the Left SRs, by the end of the civil war, were left without support and associates. And although they were never able to regain their former popularity, they were able to survive, largely thanks to their own enthusiasm and optimism.\n\nUnlike the Bolsheviks, after the war, the Left SRs were not banned or arrested, and the absolute majority of those arrested by Whites fell under amnesty. Kerensky and the Democrats did not see them as opponents, given the unpopularity of their ideas. Despite the political oblivion, the left srs did not give up trying to raise their rating. The famine that broke out in 1921 raised many Left SRs to revolt against the government, and helped them win the trust of the common people.\n\nBy 1922, there were two main groups in the PLSR: Activists and Legalists. The Activists, led by Maria Spiridonova, the 'Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution', believed that the current Socialist-Revolutionary government, united with the Kadets, had betrayed the peasantry and the ideas of populism, and that only a revolutionary struggle could overthrow their bourgeois power. The Legalists, under the leadership of Isaak Steinberg, believed that it was necessary to cooperate with the regime established in Russia, primarily in the interests of the peasantry. However, in general, the movement was united, realizing that an even greater split would only put an end to the Left SRs and write them down in the pages of history textbooks.\n\nAt about the same time, Steinberg's anarcho-syndicalist economic-political doctrine on the creation of a syndicalist-cooperative federation of economic bodies of workers' self-government - factory committees (syndicates) and political councils of labor collectives (soviets) was officially entrenched in the program of the left Social revolutionaries. The ideology of the Left SRs began to border on anarchism and extreme libertarian socialism, assuming the widest freedoms for the working classes."

rusdeminfo.27.t:0 "PLSR: 1925-1936"
rusdeminfo.27.d:0 "How did it happen that in 1926 the anarcho-syndicalist party of the Left SRs joined the coalition of Savinkov's right-wing parties? The fact is that both Spiridonova and Savinkov pursued their own political goals. Savinkov tried to attract as many politicians as possible from among the former members of the PSR to his side. Spiridonova wanted to get a platform to promote her own ideas in parliament, as well as to regain popularity among the population. However, shortly after the 1927 elections, the Left SRs left the coalition, having existed for only about a year. This was facilitated by nationalist and dictatorial sentiments within the NRPR, as well as the fact that of the 118 mandates in the Duma received by the NRPR, none went to the Left SRs.\n\nThe social upheavals that have been taking place in Russian society since 1927 have been actively used by the PLSR for its own purposes, as criticism of the government and statements about the need for a revolutionary struggle. Since 1927, the Left SRs have become the leading actors in strikes and peasant uprisings and have attracted a sufficient part of the left-wing radical electorate to their side. Spiridonova's popularity also grew, whose image as a symbol of the Russian revolution was firmly entrenched not only in the minds of the population, but also of the government, which, by decree of President Kerensky in 1928, banned the activities of Left SRs.\n\nNow, on the eve of the upcoming elections, the Left SRs have once again united with the Bolsheviks, as they did almost 20 years ago, but this time their goals are common - to win elections and establish people's Soviet power."

In this case, until July 1936, when the Senate must elect a new president of Russia by a simple majority.\n\nDespite the authoritarianism of this approach, it is there, and Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov, the current Speaker of the Senate, will hold the position of acting president until the next election.\n\nWhile Dmitry Romanov is in power, he can do a lot to strengthen his power, even though he has no real power, he is supported by the Senate. The situation is compounded by the fact that no party that can win the snap elections will be able to gain a majority in the authoritarian Senate, which is very likely to want to elect Dmitry Romanov as the legitimate president.\n\nIf this happens, we will find ourselves in a situation that Kerensky did not anticipate: the risk of strengthening the power of the Senate and the President, and a sharp reduction in the power of the Duma.

rusdem.111.d:0 "Irakliy Tsereteli, leader of the Menshevik Party (RSDRP), while in exile in Siberia in 1915, formed the concept of the so-called \"Siberian Zimmerwaldism\". This concept assumed the participation of the Second International in stopping the war.\nThe first of Tsereteli's wartime articles, entitled \"The International and the War,\" examined the reaction of various socialist groups to the war. He agreed with the view of most Internationalists, who argued that the war was not absolutely inevitable, and that the International was thus trying to limit the threat of war. He further argued that the International was not strong enough to call a general strike because the proletariat was too weak to overthrow capitalism, and it would only hurt the movement. Tsereteli also criticized the defenseists, stating that although there may be such a thing as a just defense, \"none of the belligerent powers, except Belgium, is fighting a defensive war\". That the socialist leaders of Germany, France, and Great Britain supported their governments in the war effort was also unacceptable to Tsereteli, although he explained that this \"cannot distort the historical path of the proletariat.\"\nTsereteli's second article, \"Democracy in Warring Russia,\" was basically a response to leading Russian \"defenseists,\" namely Georgy Plekhanov and Alexander Potresov, and refuted their arguments. He stated that all belligerent states were guilty and that none of them could be the victor. His third article, \"Two Years,\" looked at the development of the war and how bourgeois nationalism enveloped the conflict. He called the conflict \"an imperialist struggle for spheres of influence,\" largely sharing the viewpoint of the International, but declaring his support for self-defense. \nNow that the whole world is on the brink of a new world war, Tsereteli has again begun to write articles about the war. He criticized the Third International's aggression toward Germany, calling France an imperialist and nationalist power. In his opinion, the revolutionary proletariat should engage only in a defensive war against imperialism. The revolutionary proletariat should bring liberation to the oppressed workers, not war. Tsereteli also criticizes the so-called \"charter totalism.\" He considers this new revolutionary current a pus on the body of the revolutionary movement of the working class, which corrupts the working class with nationalism and chauvinism.  This position of the main Menshevik leader greatly undermined the influence of the pro-internationalist wing of the party."

The author pays close attention to the Bolshevik coup, as well as the history of the Bolshevik emigration since 1920.

According to Tsereteli, socialists cannot be nationalists, because their primary goal is the struggle for the interests of the working class. Therefore, the Georgian nationalism and Russophobia of the Mensheviks in Georgia are nothing more than proof of the petty bourgeoisie and opportunism of the Georgian Social Democrats. The same thing applies to the Ukrainian and Belarusian social-democrats, the Armenian Danshak party, and so on. In this regard, Irakliy Georgievich called on all social democrats and socialists to remain faithful to the cause of internationalism.

rusdem.116.d:0 "Today one of the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, Nikolai Avksentiev, gave a speech in which he expressed his opinion about left-radical and extreme right-wing forces in Russian society. In his speech, he first of all talked about the splinter parties from the Socialist-Revolutionaries - the People's Republican Party of Russia of Boris Savinkov and the Party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries of Maria Spiridonova.\nAvksentiev subjected the Party of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries to very harsh criticism. Avksentiev described them as \"a party of extremists, traitors and agents of the French International\". Avksentiev called Spiridonova not just \"Lenin's former underling,\" but \"a latent authoritarian totalist,\" referring to the fact that Spiridonova advocates the overthrow of the democratic system and the restoration of the Cheka and the Soviet regime.\nNikolai did not ignore the People's Republicans either. He also called them an extremist organization, probably sponsored by far-right monarchist and Black Hundreds organizations. Although Savinkov's patriotism is rather a positive trait, his totalitarian habits will lead Russia to ruin and collapse.\nIn general, Avksentiev urged members of his party to cooperate with the Kadets and Mensheviks to preserve democracy, prosper the peasants and workers, and build a social state."

She is known as the \"Grandmother of the Russian Revolution.\" \nUntil 1903 she spent most of her time in an illegal situation. Engaged in organizational work and dissemination of revolutionary ideas among the peasantry. She noted that, in spite of the worsening socio-economic situation in the village, the peasantry in the 1890s was much more educated and politically active, which, in her opinion, contributed to the success of the revolutionary propaganda. \nShe was an advocate of political and agrarian terror, considering them one of the most effective methods of struggle. In 1901 she actively supported G. A. Gershuni in the creation of the PSR Combat Organization. As its leader, Breshko-Breshkovskaya did not commit any terrorist acts, but became their inspirer, believing that \"to achieve good ends all means are good.\" She met in 1902 in Vologda with such prominent future terrorists as B. Savinkov, I. Kalyaev, E. Sozonov.\nIn 1905, she returned to Russia and went into hiding. Participated in the revolution of 1905-1907 years. In 1910 was sentenced to exile, where she remained until the February Revolution of 1917.\nBreshko-Breshkovskaya energetically supported A. Kerensky, who amnestied her and returned her from exile as a matter of priority, as well as the Provisional Government headed by him. In fact, it was Kerensky called her the "grandmother of the Russian Revolution. She took part in the work of the State Council in August 1917. She had a hostile reaction to the October Bolshevik putsch, did not accept the Soviet power.\nAfter the Civil War, she became one of the most prominent leaders of the Right Socialist Revolutionaries. But in the half of 1920s, due to health problems, she stepped away from politics. She died in 1934."

rusdem.119.d:0 "Vladimir Nabokov was born into the aristocratic family of the famous Russian politician Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, who became one of the founders of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets). Three languages were used in the daily life of the Nabokov family: Russian, English and French - thus, the future writer was fluent in three languages from his early childhood. In his own words, he learned to read English before he learned to read Russian. The first years of Nabokov's life were spent in comfort and affluence in the Nabokovs' house on Bolshaya Morskaya in St. Petersburg and in their country estate of Batovo (near Gatchina).\nHe began his education at the Tenishev School in St. Petersburg. Literature and entomology were Nabokov's two main hobbies. Shortly before the revolution, Nabokov published a collection of his poems with his own money.\nThe revolution of 1917 forced the Nabokovs to move to the Crimea and then, in 1919, to emigrate from Russia. Some of the family jewels were taken with them, and with this money the Nabokov family lived in Berlin, and Vladimir was educated in Cambridge, where he continued to write Russian poetry and translate into Russian \"Alice in Wonderland\" by L. Carroll.\nAfter the Civil War ended and his father returned to Russia in 1920, Nabokov settled in Petrograd. During the 1920s and the first half of the 1930s, Nabokov developed his writing talent. In 1927 Nabokov married Vera Slonim and finished his first novel, Mashenka. After that, until 1936, he created eight novels in Russian, constantly complicating his authorial style and experimenting more and more boldly with the form. Among the most famous examples of Nabokov's work are the novels Mashenka, Luzhin's Defense, Invitation to Execution and The Gift."

rusdem.301.t:0 "The Beginning of the Trade Unions Conference"
rusdem.301.d:0 "Today, an All-Russian Conference of Trade Unions is scheduled to take place in Moscow, with the participation of the government and the leadership of the PLSR and NSP parties. According to eyewitnesses, many have already arrived at the congress, including the leaders of the parties, Nikolay Bukharin and Maria Spiridonova.\n\nThe key issues that will be raised at the congress are, of course, about the future of trade unions in Russia. At the moment, most of the trade unions are controlled by the Mensheviks, many of the state trade unions are united in the VTsSPS - formally a state association.\n\nThe positions of the NSP and the PLSR on the issue of the work of trade unions remain controversial and hinder the normal functioning of the coalition. Bukharin's position is that reconciliation is necessary on this issue. All trade unions should be nationalized, that is, become state-owned and their activities should be subordinate to the state. This approach is criticized by other members of the NSP, the so-called Trade-Unionist faction, headed by Tomsky. He proposes the syndicalization of trade unions, namely, their control over economic activity, as well as their existence as separate independent cells of workers' self-government. This approach is also shared by the Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, but in the other way. They believe that the national economy should be managed by economic Soviets, created by elected representatives of unions of self-governing enterprises and cooperative unions."
rusdem.301.a:0 "The question remains open..."

rusdem.302.d.president:0 "To the surprise of many of the audience, the former chairman of the VTsSPS, the current president of the RDFR, Solomon Lozovsky, arrived at the congress. As the head of the All-Russian Union of Trade Unions since 1922 and the general secretary of the Profintern since 1921, Lozovsky is one of the key figures in the left wing of the RSDRP and in the Russian trade union movement. Although he left his position in the VTsSPS for the presidency, he felt it necessary to express his point of view.\n\nLozovsky called for leaving the trade unions alone. He said that the existing system is quite effective, as it allows workers to organize themselves, and the state to have large trade union associations under its control. Losing the status-quo, and, therefore, this balance, will lead to drastic consequences for the proletariat. Nevertheless, he pointed out that he will not veto the Bill."

rusdem.303.t:0 "The Conference Ends"
rusdem.303.d:0 "The conference is coming to an end, many delegates have expressed their points of view, the debate between one of the leaders of the Left SRs, Boris Kamkov and Alexander Shlyapnikov has also ended. At the initiative of the party leaders, two future draft laws were put forward for a general vote of the conference participants.\n\nThe first, which is part of the official program of the left Socialists-Revolutionaries, implied the transfer of economic power in the country to the federation of syndicates, which will soon be formed.\nThe second, Bukharin's project, implied the control of trade unions and their nationalization, which some critics regarded as a betrayal of the working class and the transfer of the powers of the elected trade unions into the hands of the state, which so far is neither Workers' Pepublic nor Soviet Democracy."
rusdem.303.a:0 "The Left SR project wins the majority."
rusdem.303.b:0 "The NSP project wins the majority."

rusdem.304.t:0 "The Army Mutiny"
rusdem.304.d:0 "Despite the fact that we won fair and free elections, the army, and in particular, its generals, treat our activities with a high level of suspicion. The harsh civil war, which claimed millions of lives, as well as the lives of their former comrades, seriously affected the formation of the Russian Army in the post-war years. With some exceptions, most of the generals are quite conservative, and many officers are not ready to fight for socialist ideas. We will have to solve this problem, perhaps by dismissing a couple of high-ranking officers who refuse to fight for our legally elected government."
rusdem.304.a:0 "They should follow orders not ask questions!"

rusdem.305.t:0 "The Red Days of July 1918"
rusdem.305.d:0 "In July 1918 we have attempted our coup against Bolshevism - a moment that changed the future of the Left SRs. We understood that their party is not protecting the peasants and workers and was focused only on achieving power they never handled. This time we will be much more ready. Our new enemy is much stronger than it was. And the Revolution will succeed this time, no matter what."
rusdem.305.a:0 "This time we will be ready"

rusdem.306.t:0 "Bukharin Criticizes Kerenskyism"
rusdem.306.d:0 "Speaking in Parliament today, Prime Minister Bukharin harshly went through the current political system, paying special attention to the fact that as a result of Kerensky's actions for his own enrichment, the country was on the verge of economic collapse and famine. There is poverty everywhere, and the peasants are suffering because of the unsuccessful land reform.\n\nIn his address, Bukharin also highlighted the importance of adopting his New Economic Program, which will put the country on its feet and lead to an improvement in the situation in the national economy."
rusdem.306.a:0 "We need to take measures."

rusdem.307.t:0 "NEP Bill Passed!"
rusdem.307.d:0 "Thanks to the efforts of Bukharin and the NSP party in convincing the majority of State Duma members of the need for the speedy adoption of a law on a New Economic Policy, they managed to achieve success. It has been two days since the law on the NEP came into force, which means that the Ministry of Economy and Finance now has a free hand in managing the future national economy."
rusdem.307.a:0 "Great!"

rusdem.308.t:0 "NEP Bill Strangled!"
rusdem.308.d:0 "The opposition parties in the State Duma rejected our bill on a New Economic Policy! These bourgeois capitalists, who occupied half of the seats in parliament, seem to imagine themselves the arbiters of the destinies of millions of ordinary peasants! Due to our control over the government, we can bypass the State Duma and start introducing the NEP as part of the new financial and economic policy of the government, and no duma can prevent us from doing this."
rusdem.308.a:0 "Go on with NEP!"

rusdem.309.t:0 "Start of the NEP"
rusdem.309.d:0 "The Government headed by Prime Minister Bukharin has launched an economic reform to transform into a planned economy. So far, private property remains in our country, and it will be very difficult to nationalize it. According to Bukharin's plan, it will be necessary to abolish private property in large cities, as well as to complete Kerensky's unfinished land reform. It is proposed to finally socialize the socialized land in the hands of local peasant councils, but at the same time allow the peasants to earn on their own harvest. Thus, the peasants will have an incentive to work, and the pace of agricultural development will increase significantly.\n\nThe situation is different in the city, where private property is planned to be completely abolished and all factories to be nationalized. Such a doctrine within the framework of the NEP was called \"Socialism - in the city, Capitalism - in the village\". This will allow cities to develop under the control of the state and industrialize, and agriculture to develop and feed the multi-million population of the country. In addition, the government plans to prohibit foreign companies from owning property on the territory of Russia, with the exception of some concessions."
rusdem.309.a:0 "Time to implement the NEP!"

rusdem.310.t:0 "Confiscation of Private Property"
rusdem.310.d:0 "Today will be remembered by many capitalists for a long time, because in large Russian cities, the most important strategic factories that were still in private hands were nationalized. One of these organizations was the famous Society of Putilov Factories. Already once nationalized by the Bolsheviks in 1918, and then returned by Kerensky, the Society of Putilov Factories was again nationalized, and again by the Bolsheviks, although already former.\n\nIn addition to the Society of Putilov Factories, many other enterprises were nationalized, including foreign ones associated with Putilov, which he undoubtedly perceived as attacks on himself personally. Putilov made a public speech in the Duma, where he condemned the actions of the government, but received only ridicule from the socialist majority in parliament. Putilov said that he intends to appeal to the Supreme Court and return the lost property.\n\nMany other rich owners have also stated similar problems, however, they must respect the people who elected the NSP, and they have no choice but to admit that their personal losses are for the benefit of the whole of Russia."
rusdem.310.a:0 "They should stop robbing the common people!"

rusdem.311.t:0 "Unrest in Major Cities"
rusdem.311.d:0 "In the major cities of Russia, there are small protest movements of capitalists, but especially of the middle class of small bourgeois and philistines, who also lost some property. They demand compensation from the state for the nationalization of their property. The government can make concessions to them and allocate compensation funds, but in this way we will lose points in the eyes of ordinary workers and peasants, as well as other socialist parties. At the same time, if we do not do this, we will suffer for some time from outraged capitalists."
rusdem.311.a:0 "Appease them for now."
rusdem.311.b:0 "Ignore the protests."

rusdem.312.t:0 "The Importance of 'Smychka'"
rusdem.312.d:0 "Despite the fact that our state cannot yet be called a full-fledged workers 'and peasants' state, the importance of uniting the two revolutionary classes is very necessary. The fact is that the workers do not get along very well with the peasants, whom they perceive as kulaks and bourgeois who can earn much more by their labor than they do. Despite the fact that we have raised wages and reduced the hours of workers, there is still a high level of urban unemployment.\n\nPrime Minister Bukharin stated:\n'The essence of the New Economic Policy is the union of the Proletariat and the Peasantry, the essence is in the smychka (link) of Vanguard Proletariat with a Wide Peasant Field.'"
rusdem.312.a:0 "Long live Smychka of City and Village!"

rusdem.313.t:0 "Subsidies to Peasants"
rusdem.313.d:0 "To stimulate agriculture, it is necessary to allocate subsidies to newly minted farmers for the purchase of the latest agricultural equipment and the gradual mechanization of agriculture. This will give the peasants an incentive to cultivate Russian fields, and the money received from taxes will go to the industrialization of cities.\n\nDespite the fact that our partners in the socialist bloc in the Duma strongly opposed subsidizing wealthy peasants, and some deputies even accused us of developing capitalist relations in the countryside, the government is convinced that these measures are necessary."
rusdem.313.a:0 "We will receive this money back in taxes."

rusdem.314.t:0 "On the Issue of Private Entrepreneurship"
rusdem.314.d:0 "The situation in the city has raised an open question about the future of small business owners. On the one hand, along with the nationalization of many enterprises and an almost complete ban on private entrepreneurship, there is still a sector of goods and services that are not particularly important for the economy in private hands. Prime Minister Bukharin said that for a smoother transition to the socialist economy, these sectors will remain private. Thus, capitalist relations will remain in the city, but at a small level. In addition, as the Prime Minister stated, how does a small-scale farmer or merchant differ from a worker and a peasant?"
rusdem.314.a:0 "We hope they will calm down for now."

rusdem.315.t:0 "The Invention of A New Name"
rusdem.315.d:0 "In view of the growing popularization of the idea of linking the city and the village, a list of names for newborns appeared in the official newspaper of the NSP. One of these names was the female name "Dazdrasmygda", constructed from the phrase "Long live the Smychka of the city with the village". According to some reports, the name is gradually taking root, and this month parents gave this name to their newborn girls in 5 cases out of 100."
rusdem.315.a:0 "Smychka to the masses!"

rusdem.316.t:0 "Our Companies Nationalized in Russia!"
rusdem.316.d:0 "With the coming to power of the Socialist Party in Russia, they decided to nationalize all enterprises in key industries. With the closure of our companies in Russia, we may face certain losses that need to be made up. We can appeal to the Russian government and demand payments and compensation for the nationalization of our enterprises, or declare a boycott and stop all trade."
rusdem.316.a:0 "Try to negotiate with them for payments."
rusdem.316.b:0 "Embargo them!"

rusdem.317.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Compensation!"
rusdem.317.d:0 "After we have nationalized some of the [FROM.GetAdjective] companies they demanded that we should compensate them for their loss. While they are definetely intervening in our internal affairs, we probably can't afford paying all of them. How shall we answer?"
rusdem.317.a:0 "Who they think they are?"
rusdem.317.b:0 "Perhaps, we should pay..."

rusdem.318.t:0 "Payments From Russia"
rusdem.318.d:0 "The Russian government has agreed to compensate us for nationalizing our companies. This means that we can maintain good trade relations with Russia."
rusdem.318.a:0 "Great!"

rusdem.319.t:0 "Russia Refused to Pay!"
rusdem.319.d:0 "The Russian government has refused to pay us for nationalizing our companies. This means that we cannot reach agreements with the new government and it seems that the only way is to embargo and boycott them."
rusdem.319.a:0 "They will pay for them, eventually."

rusdem.320.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Cut Ties With Us!"
rusdem.320.d:0 "Due to the nationalization of [FROM.GetAdjective] companies, they decided to embargo us and cut all diplomatic relations with us!"
rusdem.320.a:0 "Not our problems, obviously."

rusdem.321.t:0 "Open Concessions in [FROM.GetName]?"
rusdem.321.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] has offered us to sign a trade treaty. Due to the fact that they have nationalized some of the foreign companies, they seem to be in a desire need for debts from our banks. On the one hand, if we want to invest in their country, it can help our economy by receiving some profit, but on the other hand, it will boost their economy as well."
rusdem.321.a:0 "Reject their initiatives."
rusdem.321.b:0 "Sure, why not?"

rusdem.322.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
rusdem.322.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to sign the trade treaty with us, bringing their concessions into our core land."

rusdem.327.a:0 "Poor news."

rusdem.328.t:0 "The Last Foreign Concession Closed"
rusdem.328.d:0 "The happy days of foreign concessions are over. Foreign powers either refuse to invest in us and resources, or we have closed their concessions ourselves. It seems that now we will have to rely only on ourselves."
rusdem.328.a:0 "The end of Foreign Capital."

rusdem.329.t:0 "Mutiny in the Land Forces"
rusdem.329.d:0 "Since the end of the civil War, there have been serious contradictions between the Russian Army, including many officers, and first of all, generals, and politicians of the socialist mindset. Well remembering the horrors of the Civil War, the generals are very wary of the socialists, but during the reign of Kerensky, a certain consensus was reached that allowed the Russian army to develop at least.\n\nHowever, now that outright socialists are in power, riots and a boycott have begun in the army, affecting the entire combat capability of the Russian ground troops. On the part of the generals, refusal to carry out orders has become commonplace, and on the part of the officers, mass desertion and dismissal have been noticed.\n\nThus, we need to solve this urgent problem and restore order in the troops, because Russia is surrounded by enemies and their puppets. If we do not manage to restore order in the army in time, we may face armed resistance 'for the sake of preserving the democracy'."
rusdem.329.a:0 "It's time to act."

rusdem.330.t:0 "Dealing With Generals"
rusdem.330.d:0 "One of the main problems in the army is its leadership. It is high time for General Kornilov, the permanent head of the armed forces since 1920... retire. Despite the fact that he is not a monarchist and advocated a Republican system, his authoritarian tendencies and the presence of influence that allows him to seize power in the country are very annoying for the current leadership. By removing the head of the army and appointing a new commander-in-chief, we will be able to avoid problems in the future.\n\nHowever, this is not all. The head of the General Staff, Anton Denikin, although he stands for democracy and is not against the republic, popularly called the "Peasant Marshal", can also be dangerous, and probably should be replaced by a more "friendly" candidate.\n\nPyotr Wrangel, the "Black Baron", an ardent opponent of socialism and an inveterate monarchist, closes the problematic trinity. Although he does not formally hold any government posts, he is the vice-president of Kornilov in the ROVS, and has a huge influence, probably more than the two above-mentioned personalities.\n\nWe need to decide their fate in the near future, thus easing our situation."
rusdem.330.a:0 "We should decide their fate."

rusdem.331.t:0 "Defang Reactionaries ‘Legally’"
rusdem.331.d:0 "Though our mandate was through the noble institution of democracy and not through messy, sudden, and violent revolution, that does not mean our mandate is any less assured! We have every right - by will of the majority - to enact our vision for a new and free Russia. To begin this transformation, we shall eliminate the strongest threat that serves as an obstacle to our plans of reform and societal evolution: the Right-wing and Reactionary parties that oppose us in the Duma and elsewhere in the government. In order to disenfranchise and weaken these extremists and conservatives, we shall remove their ability to represent the will of their demented followers. Their parties shall be banned from elections, their seats in the government shall be revoked to be refilled in snap elections - and likely to be snatched up by our own party members - and they shall be barred from organizing and protesting both in public or private. We shall defang the opposition completely, and through entirely legal channels, all to safeguard our true and noble vision for an egalitarian and red Russian democracy."
rusdem.331.a:0 "All shall have a say in our new Russia except those too demented to accept the future."

rusdem.332.t:0 "Securing the Peaceful Revolution through Law and Order"
rusdem.332.d:0 "In order to further safeguard our democratic mandate and our plans for a red, fair, and free Russia, we have moved to illegalize many acts against the state that are deemed traitorous or dangerous to the safety of the masses. In effect, this has given the Party free reign to arrest any and all we perceive to be an enemy to the state, and the results have been transformative. All across Russia, swathes of foes - both real and imagined - are being thrown in prisons and work camps, paying their dues for their slights against the future and destiny of this new Russia. Though some have called us tyrants masquerading as democrats, we alone know the truth, and we alone know what is best for Russia. These enemies of the state shall be dealt with, no matter how much it pains us and the masses to do so, but in the end, our new Russia shall be secured as we march towards a fair, free, and democratic Socialist utopia."
rusdem.332.a:0 "A necessary evil for the revolution..."

rusdem.333.t:0 "Down with the Duma!"
rusdem.333.d:0 "With our reforms and plans for the state only proving to be more and more effective, a new age of red and gold has dawned on our Russia. However, many still seek to oppose our democratic mandate, and with it, they have become traitors to the state and - more importantly - to the people of Russia. The hive of these traitors lies within the Duma, where our remaining political enemies congregate and coalesce together, forming some weak-willed united front against the Party. In order to remove the last shred of their power over our people and our nation, Party Leader and President [root.getleader] has moved to dissolve the Duma permanently, instituting single-party democratic rule over all of Russia, and cementing the Left SR movement as the sole choice for Russia’s future. Though our enemies may complain, they can do little to stop us, for Russia’s destiny is truly crimson, and we are the heralds of this unavoidable red dawn."
rusdem.333.a:0 "We are the only party that can lead our people to greatness!"

rusdem.334.t:0 "Down with the Tricolor!"
rusdem.334.d:0 "In order to further break from Russia’s past failures and missteps, President [root.getleader] has announced that the Tricolors - both the Red, Blue, and White banner of the Russian Republic and the Gold, Black, and White banner of the Tsars - shall be banned from this day forward. It shall henceforth be illegal to fly these banners in any capacity outside historical venues, and the national flag of the state is to be changed to a more appropriate and less tainted design. Though the old guard, elders, and conservative-minded of the nation may begrudge such a change, they are in no position to even question such a move. By decree, the very face of Russia shall change, and with it, our very identity."
rusdem.334.a:0 "The symbols of the Tsarist Era and the Kerensky Regime should vanish!"

rusdem.335.t:0 "Down with the Landlords!"
rusdem.335.d:0 "In order to further destroy the hold that the old order and the vile bourgeois scum has on Mother Russia, President [root.getleader] has declared that all land in Russia - from the largest estates of the old nobility to the smallest plots owned by the smallholders - shall be socialized, with all ownership transferred collectively to the masses. Landlords of all sizes and walks of life shall be dis-landed, and their assets shall be liquidated by the state aside from what is deemed necessary to survive as decreed by the Party. These funds and lands will be redistributed to the masses, with collective farms rising in their place, though of course, the state shall also take its fair slice in order to further fund the nation’s efforts. \n\nAny landlord that refuses is to be either imprisoned and sent to work in the camps or forced into exile, and any that resist are to be put down like the dogs they are. However, any landlord who willingly cedes their land and assets shall be rewarded, allowed to enjoy our new democratic and Socialist utopia as an equal member of the enfranchised Proletariat. Russia will be free of landlords once and for all, and the masses - as well as our agricultural output under this new socialized and collectivized system - shall surely boon!"

This unpopular move was criticized by the 'legalist' wing of the party, led by Karelin and Shteinberg, who wished that the Left SRs would become a vital revolutionary force, presented in the parliament. The split in the party became even more severe and will possibly lead to the full dissolution of the party. Right now, the popularity of the left SRs has greatly decreased, with more people becoming interested in PSR and NSP."

With this proposal, Bukharin first of all turned to the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who are most ideologically close to the NSP."

rcw.2.d:0 "Suddenly, news came about the sudden death of Genaral Kornilov, which immediately attracted media attention due to his recent resignation and the appointment of the pro-government head of the Army. As reported, General Kornilov died as a result of a massive heart attack, in his home, late at night. However, according to eyewitnesses, there was a fuss in the apartment, and a black car of the Nizhny Novgorod plant was standing under the windows.\n\nThe very next day after the news, a fairly large rally gathered in Moscow demanding an investigation into the General's death, and many prominent officers made the same demands. On the one hand, we can officially recognize the death as natural, but we will lose the support of people and only raise even greater doubts. On the other hand, we can falsify the investigation and come to the same result, which will satisfy the needs of the protesters."
rcw.2.a:0 "Well, he was rather old..."
rcw.2.b:0 "Investigation Will Be Held"

rcw.3.t:0 "Kornilov's Death"
rcw.3.d:0 "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief, one of the four officers that led the White Movement against the Bolsheviks during the civil war, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68.  Kornilov has greatly contributed to post-revolutionary Russia's politics. Two weeks of national mourning have been declared as the people prepare for the funeral ceremony."
rcw.3.a:0 "The great helmsman of the Russian nation is no more." 

rcw.4.t:0 "Kornilov Raises An Uprising"
rcw.4.d:0 "Ignoring Kornilov, we were faced with the fact that he managed to get out of the capital and go to the South of Russia, where he began to convene a rather conservative electorate to defend the Motherland from the socialists. Thus, creating essentially a second Volunteer army. He was joined in the majority by other generals who declared loyalty to the former regime and the impossibility of serving the socialist minority. It seems that the situation is heating up and we need to take urgent measures..."
rcw.4.a:0 "That's enough. The government retires."
rcw.4.b:0 "Call for the loyal forces and demand Kornilov's surrender."
rcw.4.c:0 "We shall act more decisively. Proclaim the RSR!"

rcw.5.t:0 "New Elections"
rcw.5.d:0 "The government decided to resign, having lost most of the popular support and now humiliated and almost destroyed. The next election will be held in two months. Critics will say that the ruling party betrayed the masses, but, as the party leaders say, this was done in the name of national stability and in order to avoid war. The generals returned to Headquarters, disbanding the volunteer army."
rcw.5.a:0 "Victory or Loss? That is the question."

rcw.6.t:0 "Kornilov Ignores the Ultimatum!"
rcw.6.d:0 "General Kornilov has ignored the ultimatum we sent and escaped to Volgograd, where he started to build up defences and call for the Second Volunteer Army to fight against us. Well, he made his choice, now he will regret it."

rcw.8.d:0 "Anton Denikin, nicknamed the Peasant Marshal, actually has nothing in common with the peasants and the proletariat. He conducted one of the most successful campaigns against the Reds during the Civil War, so he definitely should not be trusted. At the same time, his authority is quite high, and perhaps keeping him as head of the General Staff at least for the moment will help us gain time and calm the situation in the army."
rcw.8.a:0 "Let the Cheka remove him silently..."

rcw.9.d:0 "A Hero of the Civil War and the informal leader of Russian conservatives, Anton Ivanovich Denikin, died yesterday in his manor. Although never as radical as his counterpart, Baron Wrangel, Denikin's influence throughout Russia was hard to overestimate. A week of national mourning has been declared as the people bade farewell to one of the few true Heroes of Russia."
rcw.9.a:0 "Even the strongest die one day!"

rcw.10.t:0 "Sudden Death of General Denikin"
rcw.10.d:0 "Today, our country has received the terrible news about the sudden death of one of the best sons of the Fatherland, General Denikin. With the coming to power of the Socialist Party, relations between Denikin, as well as other conservative generals, and the government deteriorated significantly. Denikin's sudden death aroused suspicions even among some supporters of the current government, let alone the opposition-minded electorate. Baron Wrangel, one of the closest associates of Kornilov and Denikin, claimed that the murder was covered up by the government and demanded that the government immediately resign and transfer power into the hands of the provisional government, which he will lead."

rcw.13.d:0 "Today, the head of the General Staff, Anton Denikin, was dismissed, and a promising pro-socialist general, Alexander Vasilevsky, took his chair. His views have long been the subject of rumors, but now they have been confirmed. Vasilevsky is respected among the generals, and therefore Denikin's resignation was not taken so seriously. Nevertheless, the former head of the General Staff himself announced an attempt to seize power, and no matter how paradoxical it may sound, he said that he intends to lead a popular uprising against the government. His statements violate the laws of our country and we should have arrested him to avoid trouble."
rcw.13.a:0 "Immediately arrest him!"

His activities can be dangerous, and therefore the government proposes to send him to retirement and dissolve the ROVS, as a prohibited military organization, unnecessary in peacetime. A less popular solution would be to leave everything as it is, assuming that there is no threat from Wrangel."

rcw.16.t:0 "Calming Down the Army"
rcw.16.d:0 "Now that all the main opponents among the general staff have been eliminated, it seems that we have managed to solve one of the main problems. At the same time, many officers are still rebelling, and we should solve this problem. The following options are available to us to resolve the crisis: to open criminal cases for desertion against those who refuse to follow orders; to raise the salaries of officers and soldiers, hoping that this will bribe them."
rcw.16.a:0 "We shall deal with them as with deserters."
rcw.16.b:0 "Rise up salaries for them."

rcw.17.t:0 "The End of Army Mutiny"
rcw.17.d:0 "We were able to cope with the unrest in the army and our armed forces are slowly starting to return to normal. This is a big victory for the government, and the leading party has dramatically increased its popularity among the population. Despite the fact that the army still does not trust us, at least they have stopped rebelling."
rcw.17.a:0 "Great!"

rcw.18.t:0 "Kornilov Surrenders"
rcw.18.d:0 "Kornilov, to our great happiness, agreed to surrender and submit to the demand of our ultimatum. The general was soon arrested and will soon be tried for attempting to organize a military coup. His stupid act allowed us to accuse the counter-revolutionary and conservative army elite of trying to usurp power and trying to overthrow the legally elected people's government, thus significantly expanding the repressive actions against the generals. The popular support was on our side.\n\nIn addition to General Kornilov, Denikin, Wrangel, Drozdovsky, and Markov, as well as all other generals connected with them in any way, were also purged. All of them were dismissed from their posts, or from the General Staff and arrested.\n\nDespite the fact that many talented generals were subjected to repression, our government is no longer in danger."

rcw.200.d:0 "After the ROVS seized power, proclaiming Kornilov as interim president, Petrograd workers began to strike against the military, demanding free elections and an increase in their standard of living.\n\nThe first strike began with the Putilov plant, but by noon the strike had engulfed all major industrial enterprises of the capital and gained mass character. The police forces were not enough to suppress the protest, and the next day the strike continued and other citizens who were dissatisfied with the seizure of power by the military joined the protest.\n\nThe situation escalated and became sharply radicalized when a number of generals sympathetic to the proletariat sided with the rebels. While the uprising in Petrograd has not spread to other regions with the effect of falling dominoes, we need to nip it in the bud, either by suppressing the uprising harshly, or make concessions to the working class and, despite the crisis, meet their demands."

Of those who are capable of leading a crowd, so far not a single party has stood up for the workers.\n\nHowever, today the news came that generals who defected to the side of the rebels arrived in Petrograd, and among them, none other than General Yegorov became one of those who spoke at a protest rally of many thousands. The general, quite energetic, announced his intention to create a Petrograd Soviet that would lead the protest uprising. Many, however, took this idea warily, remembering how the last time an institution with the same name failed. Many were afraid of a new civil war, and distrusted the general, who was fought for the Bolsheviks during the Civil War. \n\nOn the other hand, the charismatic leader of the Left SRs, Maria Spiridonova, spoke at the protest rally, who fervently convinced the audience of the need for an immediate revolution, until the reactionaries in the person of the ROVS condemned the workers and peasants to a new slavery. She called for the transfer of all power in the country to trade unions and peasant councils under the auspices of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party and announced that until the bulk of the working people join the uprising, it is doomed to failure.\n\nToday has passed without much upheaval, but in the near future the protesters will need to make a choice that will decide the fate of the whole of Russia in the near future - the collegial power of trade unions and councils of Left SRs or transfer all the power to the Red Generals for effective military action against reactionaries."

According to rumors, the ROVS had to go to the south of Russia and organize an operation center in Volgograd, where their support was still quite strong. The working people have gained a lot of strength and energy under the awareness of the fact that many cities have already risen to the defense of the working class.\n\nHowever, at the same time, newspapers announced that a delegation of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party, headed by Bolshevik Zinoviev, had arrived incognito in Petrograd from abroad. They were seen at one of the rallies in the capital, where they called for an armed struggle and the unification of workers under the rule of the Bolshevik Party. This event caused a resonance among the population, many of whom remembered the failure of the Bolsheviks and the Red Terror, and distrusted them. Others, albeit a minority, picked up the revolutionary slogans of the RKP and called on the rest to listen to the Bolshevik leaders, who suggest support and help for the Russian Revolution from the friendly Third Internationale Countries."

Many regions joined the all-Russian uprising, with the exception of those regions where the sentiments of Savinkov's associates were strong, who, despite his pro-peasant views, was ignored by the Supreme Soviet.\n\nNow that power in large cities and rural regions has come under the control of the Soviets of workers and peasants, the ChVSRK hope for the speedy subordination of the rest of Russia to the working people."

In this region, the support of the NRPR is very high, as well as the Green Army of Antonov, who, although he himself was a left SR before, joined Savinkov after the civil war. \n\nWe need to seize power in Tambov, where the socialists are not completely deprived of support and convince the population of the reactionary views of the people's Republicans.

Of those who are able to lead the crowd, so far not a single party has stood up for the workers. \n\nNevertheless, there are several candidates whom Kornilov suspects of becoming protest leaders.\nFirstly, these are some generals who had ties with the Reds during the Civil War or who sympathize with the workers and peasants. The most notable are Aleksandr Yegorov, Boris Shaposhnikov and some others. We can arrest them immediately to ensure that they don't become leaders, however this may not be enough as there are various socialist parties that would like to lead the protest."

In addition, they are one of the few parties that openly called for revolution. We can try to arrest the leaders of the Left SRs before they can lead the protest, but for this we will most likely have to turn to the help of Savinkov's combat detachments."

However, his socialist views, which always questioned his loyalty, were confirmed.\n\nYegorov arrived in Petrograd, where he led revolutionary soldiers and workers and announced the creation of a socialist republic.

Trade unions, factory committees, cooperatives - all called for an all-Russian strike and the transfer of power to representatives of the working class.\n\nUnfortunately, the new Russian government led by Kornilov had to go to the south of Russia and organize an operational center in Volgograd, where their support was still quite strong."

rusdem.351.d:0 "The Party of People's Republicans, led by Prime Minister Savinkov, today issued an appeal to the other members of the State Duma, where it called on the lower house of parliament to unite for the destruction of the stronghold of Kerenskyism, the monarchical-aristocratic Senate, which prevents the adoption of laws vital for the economy and stability in the country that can help ordinary people.\n\nLater, in the Tauride Palace, during a Duma meeting, Prime Minister Savinkov himself spoke from the rostrum, declaring the beginning of the fight against corruption in the ranks of senators and that the NRPR party would seek compliance with democratic and republican principles of the work of all chambers of parliament and the government. Savinkov noted that the program of his party, which honestly won the elections, is able to help the deteriorating economic situation, pull the peasantry out of the bondage of Kerensky's land reform, as well as the destruction of corruption among senators.\n\nSavinkov finished his speech with a quote: \"And while the senators, servants of German capital, are sitting there, robbing our people, they should keep in mind that we will fight for the rights of the peasants! And if they do not resign their mandates voluntarily, we will regard this as a coup!\""
rusdem.351.a:0 "The Senators must resign!"

rusdem.352.t:0 "Savinkov Meets Chernov"
rusdem.352.d:0 "Today, the Prime Minister visited the leader of the Duma faction of Socialist Revolutionaries, his former party member Viktor Chernov.\n\nChernov looked preoccupied, and even nervous, and it seems that he did not even hide this state of his. Savinkov and Chernov had a fairly formal conversation for an hour, in which they discussed the possible entry of the srs into a government coalition with the NRPR. However, after an hour, the doors of Chernov's office were closed to prying ears and eyes, and Savinkov and Chernov spent several more hours in private conversation.\n\nIt is not known for certain what the Prime Minister tried to negotiate with Chernov. It is quite possible that in order to resist the Senate, it needs other allies, and what is better than the Srs, whose ideology is largely the basis of the NRPR program. In addition, Savinkov himself was a Socialist-Revolutionary for a long time, namely, a participant and head of a Combat Organization.\n\nThe conversation remained a secret, at least for now, because when Savinkov and Chernov left the office, none of them said a word."
rusdem.352.a:0 "We will know the truth soon, probably."

rusdem.353.t:0 "Chernov Refused Cooperation With NRPR"
rusdem.353.d:0 "A few days passed after the meeting between the Prime Minister and Chernov. And now its results have become known. In a public speech, Viktor Chernov said that the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries will not cooperate with any party, organization or people who encroach on democracy, the constitution and freedom. It is obvious that Chernov meant the Party of People's Republicans, which means that the negotiations failed and the NPRR lost one more possible ally."
rusdem.353.a:0 "We won't forget this."

rusdem.354.t:0 "NRPR-PSR Coalition?"
rusdem.354.d:0 "A few days passed after the meeting between the Prime Minister and Chernov. And now its results have become known. Today it became known that the Socialist-Revolutionary Party will enter into a government coalition with the NRPR, in which Chernov himself will probably take the chair of the Minister of Agriculture. It seems that preparations for the socialization of the earth are in full swing. Nevertheless, as it became known, not everyone in the Socialist-Revolutionary party shares Chernov's position to unite with Savinkov in a coalition. One of the prominent figures of the Socialist-Revolutionary party, Nikolai Avksentiev, declared the illegitimacy of the coalition and called on all self-respecting Socialist-Revolutionaries who consider themselves really socialists to refrain from voting for the draft laws of the NPRR."
rusdem.354.a:0 "A new ally from the Past."

rusdem.355.t:0 "Secret Meeting With the Left SRs"
rusdem.355.d:0 "According to rumors, a secret meeting was held in Petrograd between representatives of the NRPR and the left srs. After Chernov's refusal to cooperate, it seems that Savinkov's view fell on more radical former party members. Despite the fact that now an alliance between anarcho-syndicalists and popular Republicans seems simply impossible, it is quite likely that for the sake of overthrowing the power of oligarchs and aristocrats from the Senate, even such a radical alliance takes place.\n\nIn any case, it is still impossible to say unequivocally whether such an alliance will be possible or not."
rusdem.355.a:0 "Time will tell."

rusdem.356.t:0 "NRPR-PLSR Coalition?"
rusdem.356.d:0 "What seemed impossible yesterday has become a reality today. Prime Minister Savinkov announced an alliance between the NPRR and the PLSR in the name of protecting the achievements of February and democracy. Together with one of the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, Steinberg, Savinkov announced the immediate termination of the bourgeois power of the Senate, the final socialization of the land and the democratization of power in the republic.\n\nIt is unknown how long this alliance will last, but the fact remains that the two radical parties have united to achieve their own goals."
rusdem.356.a:0 "A very unexpected alliance, indeed."

rusdem.357.t:0 "Spiridonova Denounces NRPR"
rusdem.357.d:0 "Today, the Central Committee of the PLSR, headed by Maria Spiridonova, provided the general public with a resonant statement about the inadmissibility of the seizure of power by Savinkov's NRPR.\n\nThe Central Committee said that earlier the prime Minister's party had invited the Left SRs to join the united anti-capitalist revolutionary front in order to fight the dominance of the Senate. Such a proposal was regarded by the left Socialists-Revolutionaries as a provocation and a substitution of concepts. Spiridonova stated that the ideas of the NRPR completely contradict the goals of the Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, and that nothing can justify the people's Republicans, even the struggle against capitalists and aristocrats."

rusdem.360.t:0 "The Solidarists Withdraw From NRPR"
rusdem.360.d:0 "The National Union of the New Generation party, or Solidarists, is a party organized recently by Russian youth who saw in Savinkov and his NRPR an excellent opportunity to promote their ideas. Together with other associations, such as Gorgulov's VNKPZ, the NSNP became part of the NRPR as a faction. Despite the fact that the NSNP was constantly suppressed under the influence of Savinkov's strong leadership, they considered it necessary to declare their withdrawal from the NRPR and the formation of a separate party.\n\nThis decision was made as a result of an open call on the part of Savinkov to overthrow the existing state institutions. Despite all the difficulties, and the fact that as a result of Kerensky's action, the Senate has become a stronghold of conservative forces, it is impossible to make such statements, especially in the run-up to the senate elections next year. The departure of the solidarists from the NRPR significantly affected the stability of the party, in addition to the fact that the People's Republicans lost a certain number of seats in the Duma and the Senate, Savinkov's reputation was damaged. However, he never intended to play democracy."
rusdem.360.a:0 "They were never true People's Republicans."

rusdem.361.t:0 "Savinkov Meets Kornilov"
rusdem.361.d:0 "General Lavr Kornilov is one of Boris Savinkov's old associates. Despite the fact that in the post-war period he moved away from politics and focused all his attention on the development of the armed forces, he and Savinkov remained in touch.\n\nFor several years, there have been rumors that Kornilov is ready to support Savinkov and his party in seizing power in the country. However, Kornilov is the head of the ROVS, and he still does not let go of connections with other generals, among whom there are many monarchists, and who do not particularly trust Savinkov. Kornilov will have to make a difficult choice, to support Savinkov in his upcoming fight against the Senate or to stay away, and this choice remains not obvious."
rusdem.361.a:0 "Will the meeting tell anything new?"

rusdem.362.t:0 "The Kornilov-Savinkov Alliance"
rusdem.362.d:0 "General Kornilov agreed to create a kind of alliance between the ROVS and the NRPR, openly supporting Savinkov and declaring the inadmissibility of destroying democracy in the country with the help of the Senate. His statement has already been regarded as thoughtless by many colleagues in the All-Military Union, including the director of the organization Ilyin, as well as such high-ranking officers as the vice-president of the ROVS Baron Wrangel and the head of the General Staff Anton Denikin.\n\nDespite the contradictions in the ROVS, now Kornilov's support is more important than ever for Savinkov, because the outcome of Russia's future depends on it."
rusdem.362.a:0 "Kornilov and Savinkov shall save holy Russia!"

rusdem.363.t:0 "The ROVS Won't Support Savinkov's Claims"
rusdem.363.d:0 "Today, the president of the ROVS, General Kornilov, together with the director of the organization, Ilyin, as well as Vice President Wrangel and Chief of the General Staff Denikin, made a joint statement that the Russian armed forces will act as a guarantor of peace and prosperity of Russian democracy. The Constitution, for which a lot of blood was shed in the civil war, should be preserved, and its observance is not subject to doubt.\n\nIn this regard, as Kornilov said, the prime minister of the country must respect the current Constitution and the law, and therefore has no right to dissolve the Senate."
rusdem.363.a:0 "Damn..."

rusdem.364.t:0 "'The All-Russian Ultimatum to the Senate'"
rusdem.364.d:0 "It seems that today is the X-day. Prime Minister Savinkov, speaking at a Duma meeting in the Tauride Palace today, ordered to lower two banners with the Russian tricolor behind his back, in the middle of which a crown of thorns and a sword were spread out.\n\nFrom the rostrum, Savinkov made a rather emotional speech, which he designated as "An All-Russian ultimatum to the Senate". In it, he said that on behalf of the majority of the Russian population who voted for him and his party, on behalf of the majority of people's representatives in the Duma who elected him prime minister, he calls on representatives of the upper house of parliament to immediately resign senatorial mandates within the next 5 days. Savinkov threatened that if the ultimatum is not fulfilled, the Senate will be dissolved by force with the use of the army, law enforcement agencies, the Fighting Organization of the NRPR, as well as initiative citizens who want to live in peace.\n\n'The senators will be expelled by popular anger. For all the vices committed against the Russian people, you will be punished!'"

rusdem.365.t:0 "The Senators Resigns!"
rusdem.365.d:0 "Frightened by the ultimatum of the strongest party in the history of Russia, Senators from conservative parties resigned, fearing for their safety.\n\nFor the first time in the history of Russia, members of the upper house of parliament voluntarily resigned their powers for the sake of people, for the sake of freedom and the achievements of February. The success of the NRPR and Savinkov showed that only with the national support is peace and prosperity of Russia possible."
rusdem.365.a:0 "Long live Savinkov!"

rusdem.366.t:0 "The Senators Reject Ultimatum!"
rusdem.366.d:0 "The situation in the republic became tense as soon as it became known that the conservative senators refused the demands of the NRPR and declared that they would follow the Constitution.\n\nA statement was made by the representative of conservative senators, Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich, who declared Savinkov's demands unconstitutional and immoral, violating the rights and freedoms of citizens, including those with senatorial powers. In this regard, Dmitry Pavlovich called on the army and the people, as well as the Duma opposition to Savinkov, to unite for the sake of saving the republic from the coup of the NRPR and not to succumb to Savinkov's cheap populism."
rusdem.366.a:0 "Who he think he is?!"

rusdem.367.t:0 "National Revolution!"
rusdem.367.d:0 "After the Senators' rejection of the ultimatum's demands, it is time for serious changes. By order of Savinkov, BO-NRPR fighters were stationed in major Russian cities, primarily in Petrograd and Moscow, which, according to the Prime Minister, were convened to further protect the work of municipal and city administrative buildings.\n\nThe BO-NRPR actually seized the entrances and exits to the Tauride Palace in Petrograd, as well as to the Moscow City Duma. Armed patrols are marching through the streets. It seems that the country is slowly sliding into anarchy, but so far everything looks quite calm. Savinkov urged citizens not to go out if possible, as sabotage by Senators is possible.\n\nIn addition, today, for the first time in many decades, the latest issue of the morning newspaper was not published in Moscow, as the printing house was blocked by the BO-NRPR. While there is a situation of uncertainty in the country, we need to start acting."
rusdem.367.a:0 "The situation seems to be under control."

rusdem.368.t:0 "The Shameful Stigma Of Monarchism"
rusdem.368.d:0 "Today, the newspapers presented the appeal of Prime Minister Savinkov with the propaganda of People's Republicanism. In it, he harshly went through the monarchist senators, whom he literally accused of being enemies of the people. The monarchy is the last century, and the February Revolution put an end to this relic of the past. Savinkov urged the population to forget about the return of the monarchy and the throne to Russia, because this path will be disastrous. Having criticized monarchism, Savinkov also condemned the monarchist senators who hold the majority in the Senate and do not allow the most important reforms for the people to be adopted."
rusdem.368.a:0 "Another blow to the monarchists!"

rusdem.369.t:0 "The Senate Majority"
rusdem.369.d:0 "Now that the NPRR has a majority in the Senate, the new speaker of the Senate, a close friend of Savinkov, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, declared full support for the Prime Minister in his bill on merging the Prime-minister and President offices.\n\nThe following Bill, as has Merezhkovsky mentioned, is a revolutionary to the political system in Russia. By giving our Prime-Minister broad powers to govern the country, we will ensure the victory of people, at first, and, secondly, will finally deal with the Kerensky's legacy of a presidency elected by a puppet Senate."
rusdem.369.a:0 "So that what the NRPR wanted?"

rusdem.370.t:0 "Private Talk to the Constitutional Court"
rusdem.370.d:0 "Today it became known that some people meet with judges of the Constitutional Court during private conversations behind closed doors about the upcoming bill on combining the posts of Prime Minister and president. Despite the fact that many politicians have already dubbed this as undisguised lobbying and even bribery, today Savinkov spoke in the Duma, where he said that he opposes the corruption of officials, and private conversations were nothing more than consultations about the future bill.\n\nSavinkov also noted that if there is a majority in the Duma and the Senate, he does not need to lobby the Constitutional Court, since all the formal requirements for changing the constitution have already been achieved."
rusdem.370.a:0 "That sounds reasonable."

rusdem.371.t:0 "Savinkov's Address to the Constitutional Court"
rusdem.371.d:0 "Today, Prime Minister Savinkov addressed the judges of the Constitutional Court with an official statement that they are obliged to adopt amendments to the Constitution of the RDFR on the basis of the fact that the NRPR has popular support among the majority of the population. In case of refusal to accept the amendments, Savinkov promises to raise a popular uprising against illegitimate pro-German judges.\n\nDespite the fact that many politicians have already regarded Savinkov's speech as destructive to the foundations of the constitutional system of Russia, many citizens understand the need to adopt such a law in order to save the country from the chaos of Black Monday."
rusdem.371.a:0 "Does he hope that will work?"

rusdem.372.t:0 "The Constitutional Court Examines the Bill"
rusdem.372.d:0 "The Constitutional Court of [RUS.GetNameDef] has announced that as Savinkov's Bill requires changes in the Constitution, the Court will examine this case closely and and will make a decision on the admissibility of the adoption of such amendments or not."
rusdem.372.a:0 "Let us wait for the result."

rusdem.373.t:0 "The Constitutional Court Refused Amendments"
rusdem.373.d:0 "The Constitutional Court has rejected changes in the Constitution. Unfortunately, that is not the solution the prime-minister wanted, so he has announced the deployment of the Combat Squads and the beginning of the National Revolution."
rusdem.373.a:0 "Call the Combat Squads!"

rusdem.374.t:0 "The Constitutional Court Changes the Constitution"
rusdem.374.d:0 "The Constitutional Court has adopted changes in the Constitution. Savinkov will be soon sworn in as the President of Russia."

rusdem.376.t:0 "Savinkov Deploys Combat Squads"
rusdem.376.d:0 "Today, Prime Minister Savinkov said that the NRPR is not going to give up and will not allow the country to plunge further into chaos. The combat detachments stationed in Moscow and Petrograd were ordered to seize the most important administrative buildings to seize power in the country. The same orders were received by the BO-NRPRR detachments in other cities.\n\nIt remains only to determine our most important priorities - what we should capture first in Petrograd."

rusdem.377.d:0 "The Combat Squads of the NRPR broke into the Tauride Palace, capturing it and announcing the dissolution of the Duma. Nevertheless, this step was perceived by Savinkov's opponents as reckless, given the majority of People's Republicans in parliament. The Duma building was surrounded by police officers who demanded to surrender."

rusdem.378.t:0 "The Senate Captured"
rusdem.378.d:0 "The NRPR Combat Squads broke into the Senate building, dissolving the current cabinet and arresting the monarchist senators. Despite the rather dangerous situation, the revolutionary people began to gather on the streets, demanding the resignation of the monarchists and the establishment of the power of the people's Republicans. Riots broke out in the city, but the police were able to break through to the Senate, surrounding it and demanding that the BO-NRPRR surrender."
rusdem.378.a:0 "Hold the senators as hostages and ask the Police to put down weapons."

rusdem.379.t:0 "The Police Started Shooting"
rusdem.379.d:0 "Despite the fact that we took high-ranking officials hostage, the police ignored our demands, demanding that they immediately stop the terror and surrender.

rusdem.380.t:0 "Savinkov Arrested"
rusdem.380.d:0 "The current Prime Minister Savinkov was arrested by local police units for organizing a coup. Despite the presence of armed people's Republican revolutionaries, it seems that the fate of Russia now definitely depends only on its people."
rusdem.380.a:0 "The mutiny was suppressed."
rusdem.380.b:0 "People rise in Savinkov's support."

rusdem.381.t:0 "Kornilov Deploys Army in the City."
rusdem.381.d:0 "Seeing the presence of army units, Kadets and shock troops, the police laid down their weapons, and the revolutionaries managed to occupy key administrative buildings. Despite the fact that the head of the army supported Savinkov as the legitimately elected prime minister of the country, much depends on other generals, especially monarchists."
rusdem.381.a:0 "The coup succeeded - proclaim Savinkov the Vozhd." 

rusdem.382.t:0 "The Police Puts Their Weapons Down."
rusdem.382.d:0 "The police agreed to lower their weapons, and many policemen began to surrender under the pressure of the revolutionary people and the legitimately elected Prime Minister. Thanks to the inaction of the police, the BO-NRPR was able to seize the remaining key administrative buildings, including the main police headquarters of Petrograd."
rusdem.382.a:0 "The coup succeeded - proclaim Savinkov the Vozhd."

rusdem.384.t:0 "Kornilov Refused To Support Savinkov"
rusdem.384.d:0 "Despite some sympathy and even friendliness of Kornilov towards Savinkov, he refused to bring troops into the city, probably under the influence of other officers. Without the support of the army, the combat detachments of the NPRR failed to capture key administrative buildings, and now all hope is in the Russian people."

rusdem.385.d:0 "These events will someday be evaluated in history as nothing more than the third Russian Revolution. On the wave of mass popularity of the people's Republicans and the cult of the personality of the Vozhd Savinkov, the Russian people rose to a protest uprising against the power of embezzlers, monarchists and other destroyers of the Motherland.\n\nThe rebels have already captured Petrograd and Moscow, but especially quickly the peasant southern regions of the country are passing under their control, where the popularity of the NPRR is off the scale."

rusdem.386.t:0 "Fate of Russia in Kornilov's Hands"
rusdem.386.d:0 "Perhaps even with some surprise for Kornilov himself, the power in the country turned out to be in his hands. Having an improvised army at hand, it cost him nothing to declare himself the supreme ruler, because, as the history of Russia shows, once again nothing good comes out of democracy. On the other hand, in order to avoid even greater losses, it may be worth putting power in the hands of the interim government and holding new elections."

rusdem.387.t:0 "Third Russian Revolution"
rusdem.387.d:0 "Kornilov refused to support Savinkov, leaving some part of the army under his control as a force opposing the People's Republicans. However, this is not able to break the Russian spirit, which is protesting against deprivation. Kornilov may not be with us, but we are against him! Many soldiers go over to the side of the people, leaving Kornilov's army without the best fighters of the fatherland.\n\nNevertheless, the situation is getting worse, turning into riots, armed clashes with the wounded. It seems that everything is going to a full-fledged war. However, everything now depends on Kornilov. Savinkov has already sent him an ultimatum demanding that he surrender and resign for the benefit of the people, before it's too late. Otherwise, Savinkov announced that he would force Kornilov to leave."
rusdem.387.a:0 "He must resign now!"

rusdem.388.t:0 "Kornilov Gives Up!"
rusdem.388.d:0 "General Kornilov has resigned as the Chief of the Russian Army, therefore, surrendering all the opposition forces. It is time for us to celebrate our victory. Though, some monarchist generals have escaped to the Far-East, fearing trials, this loss is not too significant."
rusdem.388.a:0 "Long live Vozhd!"

rusdem.389.t:0 "Kornilov Ignores the Ultimatum"
rusdem.389.d:0 "General Kornilov has ignored the ultimatum we sent and escaped to Volgograd, where he started to build up defences and call for the Second Volunteer Army to fight against us. Well, he made his choice, now he will regret it."

rusdem.390.d:0 "Founded during the political crisis in Savinkov's desperate attempt to find support among other parties, the Russian Revolutionary Front is very unstable. Despite the cooperation and the fact that almost all the members of the NRPR are former SRs, there are too many contradictions between the Socialist Revolutionaries and the People's Republicans. Frankly speaking, Savinkov hates leftists, and leftists hate Savinkov.\n\nAn unstable coalition will collapse at any moment, and in many respects the outcome of this event depends on Savinkov. On the one hand, he can already declare the collapse of the coalition, but this will entail an inevitable uprising of socialists against his power, and in key industrialized regions of the country. On the other hand, you can try to preserve the coalition by making small concessions to the SRs."

rusdem.393.t:0 "Spiridonova Escaped!"

He also said that from now on the Socialist-Revolutionary party will regain its good name, and made a couple of promises about the next 5 years, including the final adoption of the law on the socialization of the land, the democratization of public life and changing the electoral legislation in order to avoid a conflict between the two chambers of parliament and the president.\n\nThe Prime Minister's speech provoked both notes of approval among sympathizers and sharp criticism from the opposition, who accused Zenzinov of substituting facts and hardly possible fulfillment of promises, saying that the PSR were the party of shame under Kerensky, and will remain so."

He also said that the Senate prevented Kerensky from completing the Socialist-Revolutionary reforms and made a couple of promises about the next 5 years, including the final adoption of the law on the socialization of the land, the democratization of public life and changing the electoral legislation in order to avoid a conflict between the two chambers of parliament and the president. Moreover, he spoke of once again reviving the coalition with KDP.\n\nThe Prime Minister's speech provoked both notes of approval among sympathizers and sharp criticism from the opposition, who accused Zenzinov of substituting facts and hardly possible fulfillment of promises, saying that the SRs were the party of shame under Kerensky, and will remain so."

rusdem.413.t:0 "Denouncing Authoritarianism"
rusdem.413.d:0 "The Senate of the Republic, formed in 1925 as a compromise between left-wing Democrats and conservatives, has become a real obstacle to democracy. Filled with authoritarian politicians who do not want to carry out reforms, the Senate remains a relic of the past. There is no doubt for the government that the Senate should be disbanded and replaced by a State Council, presumably consisting of representatives of all Russian regions. In addition, the government believes that it is necessary to change the procedure for electing the president, either by making it popular or by limiting the presidential power."

However, now that the gap in the Kadet party has become obvious, a conflict has arisen between Nabokov and Nekrasov. While Nekrasov, being more left-wing, declared his full readiness to cooperate with us, Nabokov criticized this decision and said that cooperation between the KDP and the PSR had already lasted for 15 years and it had not led to anything good.\n\nThe meeting of the Kadet Party on the parliamentary coalition with us is nearing its end, and it is unknown what decision the Central Committee will make."

This was another step on the way to the democratization of our society. Long live freedom, equality, fraternity!\n\nAt the same time, not everyone found the adoption of this law a positive moment. There was a final break between our party and the right-wing Kadets of Nabokov, who were firmly entrenched in the opposition. Relations also deteriorated with other socialist parties that opposed the law, namely the Mensheviks and the NSP. On the contrary, Savinkov's NRPR has improved relations with us, because it was precisely because of Kerensky that the break occurred in many ways.\n\nIn any case, Russia will no longer be the same."

rusdem.417.t:0 "The Socialization of Land Bill Failed!"
rusdem.417.d:0 "Today, our deputies, senators, and the president.... they failed to adopt an important and necessary law for society. This is nothing less than the death of narodism and a huge failure for the socialist-revolutionary party.\n\nAt the same time, not everyone found the rejection of this law a negative moment. Relations also improved with other socialist parties that opposed the law, namely the Mensheviks and the NSP. On the contrary, Savinkov's NRPR has worsened relations with us, because the socialization of the land has not been carried out. Now we need to look for a solution to this problem, and as some party members say, it can also be radical...\n\nIn any case, Russia will no longer be the same."

rusdem.418.t:0 "The Only Right Way"
rusdem.418.d:0 "In connection with the acute political crisis that arose as a result of the failed vote on the socialization of the land, an extraordinary congress of the Central Committee of the PSR was convened to discuss further actions. In general, the discussion was divided into two main currents.\n\nThe first, proposed by the leaders of the so-called Center-Left socialists-revolutionaries, Gerstein and Volsky, was the need for a radical solution to the land issue, namely, unification with other socialist forces for the triumph of democracy, the creation of a homogeneous socialist government and the rejection of bourgeois-democratic principles.\n\nThe second, proposed by the majority of right-wing SRs, led by Zenzinov and Avksentiev, was the adoption of a compromise bill on land quotas, which would allow full-fledged socialization of land in certain regions in need, and taking into account the national and cultural component. In addition, land under private ownership would be subject to an additional luxury tax.\n\nVoting among the members of the Central Committee was mainly on the side of the right-wing Kadets, but perhaps Chernov's authority can play a role in the vote. Despite all the decentralization of the PSR, its leader still had little influence on decision-making."

rusdem.420.t:0 "Center-Left Victorous!"
rusdem.420.d:0 "The Central Committee of the PSR has voted for moving radically from a bourgeois-democratic party into a true agrarian socialist narodnik one. This has also caused the retirement of Premier Zenzinov with Volsky becoming the new one and creating a new cabinet of ministers. While the regrouping in the government has caused a little turmoil in Duma and Senate, they have nothing to do with this. Hopefully, this was the best decision."

rusdem.421.d:0 "It seems that this is how the sad history of the Socialist-revolutionary Party ends. Having failed another attempt to pass a law, with a boycott from many socialist deputies, the Socialist-Revolutionary party became only a laughing stock.

rusdem.422.d:0 "In an attempt to find comrades-in-arms, Volsky proposed to join forces with the Left SRs, close ideologically, but long ago broke away from the PSR.\n\nWith a proposal to create a united popular front, Volsky turned directly to Spiridonova, the leader of the left srs, and received consent. Cooperation with the left srs of course only increased suspicions, and many politicians began to hear speeches about an attempt to usurp power on the part of the SRs. Most of all, such rhetoric was of course from the monarchists and conservatives, as well as members of the ROVS.\n\nIt is possible that the union of Socialists-Revolutionaries will put an end to the showdowns within the Russian socialist movement, however, it is possible that this is only the beginning of the complete end of narodism."

What could have been imagined only under the rule of Kerensky, but what he never realized, was now realized.

rusdem.425.t:0 "Dealing With Siberian Regionalists"
rusdem.425.d:0 "The Siberian Oblastnichestvo is a socio-political movement that aimed at either the complete separation of Siberia from Russia, or the granting of broad autonomy to this territory. They received their greatest flourishing during the Civil War, entering various governments of the white forces. However, with the end of the civil war, the oblasts did not receive full autonomy, and Siberia remained under the control of federal forces.\n\nEverything changed in 1925, when a number of regional officials supported Kolchak and announced the creation of the East Siberian Autonomy, which became part of the Far Eastern Republic of Transamura. As we know, Kolchak tried to maintain the balance of power and promised the Oblasts to grant autonomy as soon as he regained control over the whole of Russia. However, now that Kerensky is gone, we can consider a bill on granting autonomy to Siberia, thereby increasing our support among the regionalists and residents of Siberia.\n\nThe project implies the creation of a full-fledged autonomy on the entire territory of Siberia with its own government and parliament - the Siberian Regional Duma."

rusdem.425.b:0 "Autonomous Siberia sounds stupid..."

rusdem.426.t:0 "Prime-Minister Meets Savinkov"
rusdem.426.d:0 "After the socialization of the land was adopted, which the NRPR supported, there was talk in high circles about a rapprochement between Savinkov's party and the Socialists-Revolutionaries. The return of the united Socialist-Revolutionary party will have a favorable impact not only on the party itself, but also will allow creating a strong ruling coalition.\n\nThat is why today in Petrograd, Prime Minister Zenzinov met with Boris Savinkov himself. The former socialist revolutionary, now the charismatic leader of the NRPR, and the prime minister had a long conversation and discussed key issues of creating a coalition. Among the disadvantages, experts say, is the role of the leader of the organization, which Savinkov will undoubtedly claim, so it is not a fact that the coalition will be stable."
rusdem.426.a:0 "Let's see"

rusdem.427.t:0 "PSR-NRPR Coalition Announced!"
rusdem.427.d:0 "Today, something happened that would seem impossible for many years. Ardent opponents of each other in parliament, the PSR and the NRPR announced the creation of a parliamentary coalition. We can be sure that if the PSR had any obligations with other parties, they are definitely terminated, and relations are spoiled. Despite the fact that the majority of the members of the NRPR are former social revolutionaries, the ideologies of the two parties differ, which means that each party will pull the blanket of state administration over itself. With the creation of the parliamentary coalition, new ministers from the NRPR were invited to the Cabinet of Ministers, who took the chairs of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Internal Affairs, so it seems that now all state affairs are under the control of Savinkov."
rusdem.427.a:0 "Unbelievable!"

rusdem.428.t:0 "From Paramilitary To Security Service"
rusdem.428.d:0 "Today, a government decree was adopted on the dissolution of the BO-NRPR, a paramilitary unit of the NRPR. If at first this news was perceived positively by the public, it soon became known that the militants were massively transferring to the official state service in the Okhrana and the federal security service, which is engaged in the protection of state facilities and senior officials.\n\nThus, the BO-NRPR were not abolished, but rather reformed, but we hope that the government knows what it is doing."
rusdem.428.a:0 "A good achievement, probably."

rusdem.429.t:0 "Reshuffle the General Staff"
rusdem.429.d:0 "Today, the President, at the request of the government, adopted a decree on reshuffling the armed forces. A number of high-ranking generals, mainly members of the so-called "Wrangel Clique", were dismissed. Despite the fact that the president of the ROVS, Lavr Kornilov, condemned this decision, in general, the reshuffle went smoothly. Retired generals received high veteran pensions and state dachas, as well as well-deserved rest.\n\nAt the same time, some generals were promoted, primarily known for their republican sentiments."
rusdem.429.a:0 "A nice retirement awaits them, what reason have they to complain?."

rusdem.430.t:0 "General Kornilov's Retirement"
rusdem.430.d:0 "Today it became known that General Kornilov, a war hero and one of those who are rightfully considered the winner of the civil war, announced his resignation. The almost 70-year-old general served the Motherland for a long time and did a lot for the development of the Russian army as its commander-in-chief in the post-war period.\n\nMany people call the general's departure premature and associate it with certain agreements with the government. Whatever it was, his legacy will live on."
rusdem.430.a:0 "A great helmsman of Russian Army!"

rusdem.431.t:0 "The Republican Party of Russia"
rusdem.431.d:0 "Today, representatives of the PSR and the NRPR officially announced the merger of the two parties into one, called the Republican Party of Russia, abbreviated as the RPR. Republicanism and Narodism became the official ideology of the party. Despite the fact that the NRPR and the PSR are now united, there are still factions in it, as before. Therefore, many critics of the association claim that the association between parties is formal."
rusdem.431.a:0 "Perhaps that it will bring us more stability."

rusdem.432.t:0 "False Socialists-Revolutionaries"
rusdem.432.d:0 "It seems that the government has launched an attack against the NRPR. Propaganda posters have appeared in many Russian cities, postulating that the NRPR are false socialists-revolutionaries who are trying to establish a dictatorship and a cult of Savinkov's personality.\n\nAfter the NRPR almost unanimously supported the law on the socialization of the land, it seems that the PSR is trying to avoid a sharp increase in sympathy for this party and seize the initiative in its own hands as the party that proposed this law.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned slogans, among the posters you can find such inscriptions as: 'The NRPR wants to take away your land', 'There is only one party of socialists-revolutionaries', as well as 'We gave you freedom, they are trying to take it away!'. Each poster depicted the logo of the red sun of the Socialists-Revolutionaries and a molten sword with a crown of thorns."

rusdem.433.d:0 "Today it became known that the leadership of the PSR is considering the creation of a strong parliamentary coalition with the KDP, like the one that existed in the time of Kerensky. Despite the fact that previously it was believed that the coalition exists only at the expense of the authority of Kerensky, who can hardly be called an ideological socialist-revolutionary, since then the Kadet party itself has split, and its left wing under the leadership of Nikolai Nekrasov wants to establish a strong pro-republican and pro-federalist union.\n\nIt is quite possible that the coalition will not last long, but it is impossible to say unequivocally about its imminent failure."

rusdem.435.d:0 "Representatives of the PSR and KDP parties presented a new bill that will limit the power of the Senate, thus putting an end to the issue of appointing the president and the split between the Senate and the Duma. The plan provides for removing the right of the Senate to appoint the president and oversee his activities, transferring these powers to the government and the Duma. Thus, the president will actually be appointed by the current government, which will avoid conflict situations between these two institutions of executive power. The Duma will oversee the activities of the president, that is, the president will no longer be accountable to the Senate.\n\nIn addition, the Senate reform will abolish the socio-demographic qualification for senate elections, making them nationwide. The right to appoint 50 Senators will remain with the president.\n\nIn general, the Senate will become more democratic, and will truly represent the interests of citizens, and our political system will become even more free and open."

rusdem.437.t:0 "Electable President"
rusdem.437.d:0 "The new law that has just been adopted will finally allow us to rid our country of senatorial bondage, when the president appointed by the upper house acts against not only the Duma, but also the whole country. From now on, the President will be elected in general elections, and his activities will be supervised by a popularly elected Duma.\n\nIn connection with the adoption of the new law, it was decided to call new presidential elections when the term of the current President is over."

In connection with this appointment, Avksentiev announced the adoption of a new party code, as well as the replacement of some ideological principles in connection with adaptation to a new era in the history of the party.\n\nSo, Avksentiev said that since the revolutionary ideology no longer symbolizes the party, its name will be changed to the "Party of Socialist Reformists". Avksentiev suggested that, in this way, the party will be able to attract even more supporters and show peaceful and democratic intentions. Since the party's abbreviation will remain PSR, it will not lose supporters. In addition, Avksentiev said that the ideology of the party will remain the same, but the party will move away from the exclusively peasant agenda in connection with the disappearance of the peasantry as a class in order to represent wider segments of the population.\n\nThe decision of the Central Committee was massively criticized by the center-left of the party, whose unofficial leaders are Gerstein and Volsky, to the point that many of them chose to leave the party. According to sources, many of that minority have already joined more" left-wing " peasant parties, namely, joined the PLSR and the NSP."

The deep party split, which has lasted since the civil war, does not allow us to effectively start state reforms.\n\nAt the moment, the leader of the party is already quite elderly Alexander Potresov, one of the founders of the RSDRP and an ardent supporter of reformism. Under his auspices, the party became a key agitator of workers ' rights and many Mensheviks were appointed to key positions, and trade unions became almost completely controlled by the Mensheviks. As the head of the party, Potresov established contacts with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Kadets, and became their close ally.\n\nAt the same time, until 1927, the Central Committee of the RSDRP was dominated by the left Menshevik internationalists under the leadership of Raphael Abramovich, a member of the Bund, who openly cooperate with the Third International. In connection with the death of Kerensky and the victory in the elections, it seems that it is necessary to convene a new congress of the Central Committee and determine who should be in charge."

However, the Jews, of whom there are quite a lot on the territory of our country, still do not have any autonomy.\n\nThe leadership of the Bund, including Prime Minister Abramovich himself, consider it important and necessary to adopt a law on Jewish cultural and national autonomy. Thus, it is proposed not to create a certain territorial autonomy, due to the widespread settlement of Jews, but to grant the Bund powers to implement cultural and educational policy in the interests of the Jewish population, primarily the working class."

Together with Plekhanov, another founder of Menshevism, he founded the group "Liberation of Labor", was one of the leaders of the Second International.\n\nAnd these are not the only achievements of Askelrod. It was he who achieved the unity of the party in the years after the civil war and thanks to him, internal party differences have not been so strong for the last almost 10 years. Askelrod, an ideological supporter of reformism and an alliance with the bourgeoisie, building a state where workers and capitalists can live in peace, laid the foundations for the successful rule of the Menshevik party.\n\nThe memory of him and his achievements should be perpetuated, and that is why the government initiated the renaming of one of the central streets in Moscow to Askelrod Street."

It is understandable, but the Councils themselves as a system of collective management are one of the best types of local self-government. Since the Civil War, there have been many councils in Russia, but they are all characterized by different structures and limited in their decisions.\n\nThe Mensheviks ' proposal is to create a federal system of councils of different levels, which will be formed first into municipalities, and then into a federal legislative body of each region. This will give the regions more autonomy in the adoption of local laws and create a fair system of representation of the population."

Thus, the deputies of the RSDRP announced a reform of the Senate, which will get rid of presidential senators and instead expand the number of regional senators to 75, as well as elected senators to 75.\n\nThus, half of the Senate will be elected by the population, and the other half by the legislative regional bodies, also elected by the population. It turns out that the Senate will become fully democratically elected, which will save us from the authoritarian system partially operating in the upper house of parliament.\n\n"

Since many of those who are now in the government and the Central Committee are representatives of left Menshevism, they decided to establish a separate party - the Russian Socialist Workers' Party of Interationalists, or RSRPI.\n\nThese same people had already attempted to create this party, even during the Civil War, when they wanted to support the Bolsheviks, but soon the Reds finally lost, and the RSRPI was never able to form itself into a separate party. Now it was her turn. The citizens of Russia should know that our party stands for workers ' socialism and internationalism, which will be officially reflected in our name."

rusdem.502.d:0 "The unfinished land reform, according to Nekrasov, undoubtedly hinders the normal development of the country, and first of all, the majority of the peasantry. However, the full socialization of the land will not happen. Instead, as the Prime Minister suggested, normal capitalist relations will develop in the village, as well as broad control over the protection of the land rights of peasants will be deployed. In this regard, the National Agrarian Fund will also be created, from which peasant allotments will be subsidized annually, developing agriculture and securing a good harvest."
rusdem.502.a:0 "A good solution."

rusdem.503.t:0 "Protection of Workers' Rights"
rusdem.503.d:0 "The big problem of Russia since the time of the Bolsheviks is the question of workers. Despite the fact that most of the workers' rights were enshrined in the Constitution, for a long time the agrarian party of the Socialist-Revolutionaries was in power, which did little to support the proletariat. The Nekrasov government intends to correct this mistake by guaranteeing the full right of workers to strike. In addition, the KDP intends to seriously deal with the capitalists - owners of factories, and in case of excesses, immediately dismiss the managers. The working day will be reduced to 8 hours, and workers' salaries will be increased, largely due to budget cuts for the police and the army, which, although they also require development and attention from the state, do not need it so much at the moment."

The Nekrasov government plans to change this measure by amending the electoral law and making the elections of senators nationwide by analogy with the elections to the Duma. Such a measure will be able to increase the effectiveness of popular representation in the upper house of parliament, and moreover, will prepare the ground for further senate reform - namely, the abolition of presidential senators."

Its most prominent members were the Don entrepreneur Ivan Efremov, the Moscow industrialist Alexander Konovalov and the businessman Pavel Ryabushinsky.\n\nThe Progressive Party was supposed to become a major party uniting Russian entrepreneurs, but after the February Revolution, the party finally collapsed, and its members, including Prime Minister Nekrasov himself, tried to establish a new party, but soon abandoned these attempts.\n\nA lot of time has passed since that moment, and progressives have mostly joined the Kadet party, taking a centrist position in it. However, unlike Nabokov, who leans towards a constitutional monarchy, progressives favor a federal republic with a strong president. Nekrasov believes that it is necessary to preserve the unity of the party, and therefore the progressive Konovalov should be invited to the government."

He has been promoting constitutional monarchy and market liberalism for many years, but now a new person will take his place. And despite everything, it seems that this person will be Alexander Konovalov - a progressive and entrepreneur, who, unlike his predecessor, stands not for a constitutional monarchy, but for a strong presidential power. However, since he takes the place of the Minister of Economy, it seems that the Kadet party will become even more unified."
rusdem.506.a:0 "Good news that the party is unified."

rusdem.507.t:0 "Backward Judicial System"
rusdem.507.d:0 "The Russian judicial system is undoubtedly outdated and needs to be changed as soon as possible. The fact is that in practice, the judicial reform of 1864, built under the tsar and the aristocracy, continues to operate, as a result of which the masses of the people remain largely defenseless. Despite the fact that the judicial system was changed after the Constituent Assembly, the changes were largely insignificant. The judicial system remained too cumbersome and inconvenient, as well as essentially open to corruption. It is necessary to develop a new clear judicial system with a certain hierarchy and levels, as well as to federalize this system by combining various regional and district courts under a single Supreme Court of the Russian Republic."

With the authoritarian senate gone, today a truly democratic and free Duma and its elected Prime Minister and President are leading Russia into a bright future. The successful reforms of Nekrasov and his 'New Tactics' helped the Russian Republic to become what it should have been 15 years ago. The era of the plutocratic tsars and Kerenskyism has passed into oblivion. From now on, our legal, free and democratic state will be an example for other countries, especially Eastern European ones."
rusdem.508.d.nosenatereform:0 "Despite the fact that the Duma failed to win and carry out the reform of the Senate, many democratic reforms were undertaken and carried out. Their effectiveness will still be appreciated by time and future generations. Our republic cannot be called truly parliamentary, because the power of the President and his electability by the Senate are still preserved.

He began his speech by describing his strategy, calling it an 'Old Deal', apparently in order to ridicule Nekrasov's 'New Tactics'.\n\nDespite his determination, such an outburst did not go unnoticed by the left wing of the party, which criticized the prime minister for worsening the image of the party and introducing a split, simultaneously condemning his preference for outdated ideas of a consensual monarchy. In any case, Nabokov will probably soon do something to promote the ideas of a constitutional monarchy, otherwise his government will be doomed."

rusdem.514.d:0 "If we even consider privatization of all Russian lands to be the solution of the Land Issue, it is still clear that even this quite simple Bill the Parliament has rejected. Without proper private property, we cannot truly develop our liberal principles.\n\nThat's why the government decided to intervene and forcefully privatize all the land, despite the Parliamentary decision. While this can cause serious problem, we are sure to deal with them."

rusdem.515.t:0 "Tax Reform"
rusdem.515.d:0 "Our current tax system... not really good. At the moment, we have an income tax of 15%, which, although it brings a lot of money to the budget, it causes trouble for the population. Therefore, we have two proposals under consideration.\n\nThe first is to introduce progressive taxation, which will allow the poor to give a smaller part of their income, and the rich to pay more taxes. Such a proposal, of course, will not suit the rich, but it will suit the majority of the population.\nThe second is to reduce the income tax to 14%. It will also satisfy the poor, who will pay less than they do now, and at the same time the popularity of our government will greatly increase. Despite the fact that the budget will suffer from such a reduction, we hope to recapture these costs with the help of fiscal reform."

rusdem.523.t:0 "The Emergence of a New Social Class"
rusdem.523.d:0 "For many centuries, a simple Russian peasant was a peasant, in particular, a serf, actually a slave of a feudal lord - and then a capitalist. When Alexander II abolished serfdom and granted freedom to the peasants, Tsarist Russia forced them to pay taxes and pay debts for land. Then the Bolsheviks came. Having taken the land from the people, they gave it to the people, and then the war began and they took away their last crop, famine and death began. Then came the era of Kerensky, who decided not to take the land from ordinary peasants completely. He allowed them to work on the land, cultivate it and grow food. But at the same time, he deprived millions of other peasants who lived near the cities where the capitalists seized the land of this right. And, finally, the era of the Kadets has come. A fair and honest era, where people were given the right to privatize land, where the government began to control monopolists, and gave the peasants the right to enrich themselves.\n\nThere are no more peasants. This era has finally sunk into oblivion. Now there is a Russian Farmer-entrepreneur who feeds Europe and Russia. An entrepreneur who receives fair money for his work, who sets the price for his services and goods himself. This is the triumph of capitalism - this is the triumph of democracy."

rusdem.526.t:0 "Our Direction"
rusdem.526.d:0 "Despite the fact that outwardly the main conservative party of Russia, the All-Russian National Union, is said to be united and adamant in its decisions and ideology, this is not true. The party, like the other Russian parties, is divided, and each of the leading persons in the party is playing his own game.\n\nOn the one hand, the formal leader of the party, Vasily Shulgin, is a convinced monarchist, a former Black-Hundredist, who, however, is not inherent in chauvinism. His main goal is to restore the constitutional monarchy and create a large right-wing coalition.\n\nOn the other hand, the informal leader of the party, Dmitry Romanov, although he is one of the main contenders for the Russian throne, has his own power as the main goal. He is not close to a constitutional monarchy, or rather, he does not trust the masses and seeks to strengthen the power of the Senate. But in this case, it will be necessary to rely on the pro-republican Eurasianists.\n\nThere is also a third player, Felix Yusupov. A close associate of Dmitry Romanov, he is convinced of the need to transfer power to large capital, oligarchs, which he himself is to some extent. Of course, this includes strengthening the Senate.\n\nThus, there are two ways - to rely on the aristocracy, or on large capital. Creating a coalition with the monarchists or Republicans will do its job."

The opposition, which will soon occupy the Senate and will dictate its terms. But everything comes to an end. And the referendum on the restoration of the monarchy, so desired by Shulgin, failed. Like Shulgin himself, now cursed and hated by everyone.\n\nWe can only hope that the new prime minister will lead the party out of the crisis."

rusdem.528.d:0 "The Stolypin agrarian reforms were a series of changes to Imperial Russia's agricultural sector instituted during the tenure of Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, who our party considers to be one of the greatest politicians ever lived in Russia.\n\nStolypin believed that tying the peasants to their own private land-holdings would produce profit-minded and politically conservative farmers like those living in parts of western Europe by abolising the Obschina system, that tied the peasants into socialist cooperatives and poverty.\n\nWhy Stolypin has tragically died long ago, his legacy lives. The Neo-Stolypinist appoarch in agrarian policy is now one of the headliners of the VNS party programme. We shall once again abolish any existing Obschinas, subsidize the agricultural sector to develop large-scale individual farming and introduce affordables credits for peasants in the Rosselkhozbank - Russian Agricultural Bank."

Shulgin himself belonged to the Black Hundreds, although he was not so radical and he did not have anti-Semitic views. However, he knew many Black Hundreds personally, and now, having come to power, their experience and knowledge can be useful.\n\nThe RNSMA, the Russian People's Union named after Mikhail the Archangel, led by Purishkevich, is now nothing more than a marginal group of essentially counterculturists, radical monarchist nationalists who advocate building a great empire."

The socialist parties are destroying and destroying our culture, trying to equalize everyone and depriving the best minds of the fatherland of the opportunity to develop themselves. The foreign fiction of Marx, Sorel and other founders of modern socialism are harmful books that corrupt the minds and enslave millions of people.\n\nThat is why today the government, together with the president, announced the adoption of an emergency decree on "Social Protection". About protection from malicious ideologies that try to desecrate our traditional values and culture. The text of the decree announced the immediate termination of the activities of the PLSR, PSR, NSP and RSDRP parties, their inclusion in the list of organizations banned in Russia with the seizure of all their property. This decree also refers to the dismissal of all officials associated with these parties and their lustration, that is, a ban on participating in political activities.

rusdem.532.d:0 "After many years of democracy, conservatives have finally learned to cope with the eternal problem of being in the minority.

Somewhere we need to give in, and somewhere we need to prove our position and achieve the execution of the decrees.\n\nDuring our term, we had to do a lot, in some places we had to reduce the rights of social groups for the common good, and in some places we were forced, on the contrary, to give up all for the sake of one person. This is the new Russian conservatism - to put politics on the scales and achieve balance. And although we still have a lot to do, we have already achieved the main thing-recognition of our power and satisfaction of public needs."

rusdem.535.d:0 "Since the adoption of the Constitution of 1920, Russia has been a federation, and many minorities have received their representation in the regions, as well as not only national-cultural, but also territorial autonomies with local self-government.

For many years of Kerensky's rule, the roads remained state-owned until the VNS Party returned them to private hands.\n\nToday in Moscow, it was announced the re-establishment of the Moscow-Kazan Railway Association, as it is known, the richest oligarchs of Russia, including Putilov and Ryabushinsky, were among the founders. The Moscow-Kazan Railway was known as the largest private railway in the Empire, but soon we may hear about the revival of the Society of the Ryazan-Ural Railway, which will be able to compete with the first not only in length, but also in the amount of profit."

rusdem.555.d:0 "Vasily Shulgin, an inveterate monarchist and leader of the VNS, today addressed the top party leadership and shared his proposal for a new candidate for the Russian throne. In his opinion, after the abdication of Nicholas II and the confusion in the order of succession that arose as a result of all the events, there is no urgent need to restore the Romanov dynasty.\n\nAlthough Shulgin formally supports Roman Petrovich as a legitimate candidate for the tsarist throne, he sees an equally important figure in the framework of rallying the people and restoring a strong government... Pyotr Wrangel! According to him, it is Wrangel who is able to save Russia from a catastrophe, and his popularity among both the population and the army will contribute to the stability of the government.\n\nAs Shulgin said, he had already had a conversation with Wrangel himself on this issue, and the Black Baron was not against it if it was necessary to save Russia."

rusdem.556.t:0 "Choosing the Candidate"
rusdem.556.d:0 "One of the most basic issues of the referendum is not so much the restoration of the monarchy itself, but who exactly will be the new Emperor of All-Russia.\n\nAfter the murder of Nicholas II and his family, as well as his brother Mikhail Alexandrovich, opinions about who should lead the dynasty were divided. Approximately 40% support Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich and his heirs as a contender for the throne. Opponents also refer to the fact that his marriage was not recognized by Nicholas II, or there is no clear confirmation of this.\n\nThe second main contender for the throne is the current speaker of the Senate, Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich, who, unlike Kirill, has no legal obstacles to the rights to the throne. However, it symbolizes the old aristocratic system and is not so popular with the masses.\n\nIn third place is the young prince Vsevolod Ioannovich, who is barely 20 years old, but at the same time enjoys wide popularity among the population as a young aristocrat who never lived under the tsarist autocracy. The fourth candidate for the throne, Prince Roman Petrovich, is also competing with Vsevolod Ioannovich, who is also quite young and ambitious.

No matter how much she claims to be the true, lost daughter of Nikolas, the nation seemingly knows the real truth - regardless of who this woman truly is, she is definitely not the lost and beloved Anastasia. This growing atmosphere of hatred and skepticism directed towards her has begun to make the impostor quite nervous and morose, and with her history of mental illness and instability, those close to her fear that the Tsaritsa may be driven to do something brash.

Despite government pressure to stop publication and circulation of the story, and despite shadowy intervention from Anastasia’s mysterious and anonymous benefactors, the story has become the talk of the nation, with Russians from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok murmuring over the news. \n\nThe piece has revealed to the wider nation that this ‘Anastasia’ is in fact a Polish woman with the pseudonym Anna Anderson. Born as Franziska Schanzkowska in Borowihlas to a Polish family, Anderson was institutionalized to a mental asylum in Berlin after attempting suicide, where she first proclaimed to be the late Grand Duchess Tatiana before later changing her story to be her sister Anastasia. Taking the name Anna Anderson as a play on Anastasia, Anderson has masqueraded as Anastasia since the 1920’s, traipsing around Germany and the Alps before returning to Russia to begin her ploy. \n\nThis revelation, though already suspected at least partially by many, has sent shockwaves through Russia, further damaging the Tsaritsa’s fragile and failing reputation. As her popularity further plummets, so too does her mental health and sanity, and many close to the false Anastasia have begun to notice her self-destructive and near-suicidal habits. She remains under close watch by her handlers and guards as the rest of her cabinet continues to rule the nation with her as their facade, but the cracks in this false Tsardom’s hegemony is finally starting to show."

Coming hot off the presses, the article - once again making the front page - has revealed allegedly real and verifiable ties between the impostor Anna Anderson and the Mladorossi movement of the Transamurian exiles. Calling for a vile and bastardized fusion of Soviet Bolshevism and Russian Imperial Monarchism, the Mladorossi allegedly were the ones to secretly fund Anna Anderson’s rise to the throne, and are behind the shadowy deal that made the electoral council vote unanimously on such a clear pretender to the throne. \n\nThough the information of this article is quite unverifiable, and with no sources to back it up, many scholars believe it to be completely dubious at best. However, the masses do not see it that way, and the true Romanovs have used this to further their own cause. It would seem that the Russian people have somehow come to revile their false Anastasia even more, only fueling Anderson’s descent into madness and total despair."

Citing her ability to speak German and Polish as evidence, the piece holds no veracity or grain of truth whatsoever, but the masses have begun to froth at the mouth just the same. All across Russia, the people are in a rage over their sovereign pretender, and national outrage is reaching a peak not seen since the failed Revolution and our horrid brother war.

rusdem.576.d:0 "While strolling around the expansive grounds of the Winter Palace while on a meeting with one of her courtiers, the false Anastasia was nearly murdered! Sneaking onto the grounds in the dead of night and hiding out in the foliage and shadows waiting for his time to strike, this unassuming, scantily-dressed, and clearly deranged man lept at the Tsaritsa and her aid with a knife and snub-nose pistol. Firing and swinging wildly, the insane assassin missed his mark, and was quickly put down like a diseased dog by the Royal Guard rushing to the scene. Despite no serious injury, the false Anastasia was left shaken and terrified, fearing for her life. She ran off to her quarters and has locked herself inside, and has since been inconsolable. It would seem this attempt on her life was the final straw for her sanity and mental health as the mentally fragile Anna Anderson once again spirals into the deepest pits of depression and despair. A black cloud surrounds the throne of Russia, and some believe the worst is still yet to come."

rusdem.5766.d:0 "Though the governance of Russia was already largely in the hands of others under the false Anastasia, this reality has come to become totalized, for with Anna Anderson’s mental state at an all-time low, she is entirely incapable of any responsibility expected for a Tsar to handle. As such, the shadowy group behind her ascension have moved to formally put the Tsaritsa under house arrest within the expansive old Royal Palace in Tsarskoye Selo -  as they formalize an anonymous regency council to officially administer the Russian Empire in her stead. Declaring to the public that the Tsaritsa is ill and incapable of currently handling the rigors of statecraft, this new regency council shall be the faceless rules of our Empire - a shadow council upholding a false monarchy to achieve their own ambitions and ends for the Russian people and their domain."

After ceaseless slander, media coverage, court gossip, and violence against her and her rule, the mentally ill Anna Anderson has lost all will to go on, and as such, has made up her mind on what she must do next, for in her damaged and twisted mind, there can be no other alternative. \n\nClimbing to the top of the Tsarskoye Selo Palace’s tallest keep, Anna Anderson - born Franziska Schanzkowska and masquerading as Anastasia Romanov - has lived a lie for decades, and with the realization of what she has done, and what the people - her people - think of her, becoming so finally clear to her, this pretender to throne has made her final peace. \n\nIn her stead, she would leave Russia alone and vulnerable, but free to take its own path, with the remaining true Romanovs likely pushing for a pure Imperial restoration while the common-man politicians push back for a restored Republican system in the face of such a discrediting reign. Regardless of the outcome of their decisions, Russia will be free from false nobility and free to choose its destiny once more - that is, if no one stops her. \n\nAs the false Anastasia made her final ascent, preparing to throw herself off into the cold void beyond, several of the Royal Guard tasked with keeping her under house arrest took notice of her absence, and were making their way up the tower behind her. With only moments to spare, Anderson thought one final time on all that she had wrought before finally taking the final step just as the Royal Guard burst into the room. With the whole of Russia’s fate hanging in the balance, the Guards dash to grab her as she steps off the ledge, and they are..."

Kirill Vladimirovich, the eldest in the family, considered himself rightfully the legitimate emperor, and therefore categorically opposed the reign of Boris.\n\nBoris's morganatic marriage with an unrelated and divorced woman deprived him of hypothetical opportunities to receive the Russian crown after his older brother Kirill Vladimirovich. However, against all odds, he was elected the new monarch.  The marriage was not officially recognized by Kirill Vladimirovich, who considered himself an Emperor, and he reacted extremely negatively to his brother's marriage, and Boris Vladimirovich did not even try to get his consent to this union from him. Further, despite the personal good relations, the brothers communicated quite rarely due to Kirill Vladimirovich's rejection of Boris Vladimirovich's wife and her relatives. Despite the fact that Boris was happy in this marriage, Kirill Vladimirovich condemned this marriage and did not want to accept his wife. And he didn't want to visit them without his wife. So they stopped seeing each other.\n\nNow that Boris has become a monarch, Kirill considered it proper to publicly renounce his brother, which divided the already divided royal family even more."

Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich was considered Vladimir's father for a long time, but after the revolution, Andrei Vladimirovich married Matilda, thereby crossing out his claims to the royal throne, and adopted Vladimir. \n\nFor a long time the family lived over the border in Germany, but in the early 30-ies have moved back to Russia.

rusdem.589.d:0 "A scandalous article was published in the press, criticizing our tsar, Dmitry, and his closest associate, Felix Yusupov. In the article, they are the ones who are declared Rasputin's murderers.\n\nRasputin was killed on the night of December 17, 1916 in the Yusupov Palace on Moika, Petrograd. Early information about the murder was contradictory, as it was confused both by the murderers themselves and by the pressure on the investigation of the Russian Imperial and British authorities. Yusupov changed his testimony several times. The investigation lasted two and a half months until the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II on March 2, 1917. On this day, Kerensky became the Minister of Justice in the Provisional Government. On March 4, 1917, he ordered a hasty termination of the investigation, while investigator A. T. Vasiliev was arrested and transported to the Peter and Paul Fortress, where he was interrogated by an Extraordinary Investigative Commission until September, and later emigrated.\n\nAccording to a new version in the press, Rasputin was killed by Yusupov, Dmitry Romanov and Vladimir Purishkevich, and the entire political elite of that time and the State Duma, including Kerensky, knew about the murder. Rasputin was first lured into the basement, treated to red wine and a pie poisoned with cyanide. Yusupov went upstairs and, returning, shot him in the back, causing him to fall. The conspirators went outside. Yusupov, who returned for the cloak, checked the body, suddenly Rasputin woke up and tried to strangle the killer. The conspirators who ran in at that moment started shooting at Rasputin. Approaching, they were surprised that he was still alive, and began to beat him. According to the killers, the poisoned and shot Rasputin regained consciousness, got out of the basement and tried to climb over the high wall of the garden, but was caught by the killers who heard the dog barking. Then he was tied up with ropes on his hands and feet, taken by car to a pre-selected place near Kamenny Island and thrown off the bridge into the Neva wormwood in such a way that the body was under the ice.\n\nThe article caused a wide resonance in society, however, Prince Yusupov and Emperor Dmitry refused official comments. Perhaps no one will ever be able to know how Rasputin really died."

Factionalism has divided this new pseudo Zemsky Sobor, and for far too long our nation has lived a half-life - an Empire without its Emperor. This has begun to have a noticeable effect on the mental health and morale of the masses, who have begun to lose hope in their government once again. The situation has gotten so bad that peasants across Russia, from the streets of Saint Petersburg to the windswept plains of Siberia, have begun to report sightings of the beloved Nikolai II, who was slaughtered by the Bolsheviks during the Civil War...or so we thought. These phantom sightings are probably nothing more than schizophrenic serfs seeing spectres, haunted by past hopes and grandeurs as the current government further proves its ineptitude.

However, with this return has come the question of who shall reign as the new Tsar. Though most expect Nikolai II to once again take his rightful crown, he has expressed hesitation at this idea, for he has grown old and weary. Though he is willing to take the position if he must, so that he may stabilize the nation as he teaches Alexi how to rule, he has expressed that he would much rather retire from public life now that his duty is done, and allow other, younger candidates vie for the throne instead.

Hearing of the existence of such a foul creature - one who would pretend to be his most beloved daughter Anastasia - Nikolai was thrown into a fit of rampage and primal anger. Grabbing his royal sabre and personal Nagant Model 1895 7-shot service revolver, the fuming Tsar left the Winter Palace in a furious hurry, with multiple guards and attack dogs in tow. \n\nRiding out to the home of Anna Anderson - a modest estate on the outskirts of Saint Petersburg provided to her by the pre-coronation regime - Nikolai and his posse surrounded Anderon’s residence and began to set it alight, seeking to flush the impostor out. As the dacha began to burn, the false Anastasia ran out of the inferno - right into the field of fire for Nikolai and his men. Before she could even utter a word of shock or protest, gunfire erupted from every angle, barraging the foul and venomous liar in a hail of lead and gunsmoke. \n\nAfter every soldier had expended their brought ammunition, Nikolai himself walked up to the bloody pulp that was once Anna Anderson, and used his royal sabre to slice off her head as he allowed his hounds to eat upon her flesh before once more riding off, back to the Winter Palace where they came. As they rode off, the dacha collapsed into ashes and cinders as the circling goshawks landed upon her corpse to eat the remains before the wolves came to devour the rest, finally freeing Russia from the delusions of the false Anastasia."

POLITICS_ALEKSANDR_KONOVALOV_DESC:0 "Alexander Ivanovich Konovalov was born in the family of a Vichug manufacturer and the daughter of a Moscow merchant in 1875. In 1897, he became chairman of the Board of the Partnership of Manufactories "Ivan Konovalov and his son", and in 1905 - Chairman of the Committee of Trade and Manufactures of the city of Kostroma. He was also a member of the founders of the Ryabushinsky Bank of Moscow, the Russian Joint-Stock Flax Company, and was chairman of the Council of the Russian Mutual Insurance Union.\n\nKonovalov became a successful entrepreneur, introducing advanced technologies at enterprises. However, he was a supporter of a paternalistic policy towards workers in order to achieve social peace. In 1900, he introduced a 9-hour working day in his factories, banned the work of minors. Konovalov's paternalistic policy led to the fact that during the growth of the strike movement, the factories of his Partnership had a much higher level of social stability than at other enterprises in the industry.\n\nIn 1905, he began to participate in political life, becoming one of the organizers of a small Trade and Industrial party, then he was a member of the Peaceful Renewal Party. He belonged to a group of young Russian entrepreneurs, unlike his older colleagues, who advocated social reforms and were critical of government policy. In 1912, he founded and headed the Progressive Party in the hope of promoting market liberalism and democratic reforms, but the party did not become popular with the population. In June 1913, he submitted to the Duma a bill on the labor issue, which provided for such labor protection for women and minors, construction of housing for workers, disability insurance, old age, etc. In 1914, he was a supporter of the unification of all opposition forces (up to the Bolsheviks) for non-duma opposition to government policy. He later became Minister of Trade and Finance in the Provisional Government. In the spring of 1917, he opposed the forceful suppression of left-wing radical (including Bolshevik) political forces, and in July 1917 he joined the Kadet Party and was elected to its Central Committee.\n\nSince the end of the Civil War, he has been a strong supporter of Nekrasov and Milyukov, and considered it necessary to empower the president with expanded powers, that is, the transformation of Russia into a presidential republic. He is known to be a proponent of compromises between entrepreneurs and workers while preserving the freedom of private initiative in industry. A resolute opponent of strengthening state regulation of the economy and a sharp increase in taxation of entrepreneurs."

POLITICS_VLADIMIR_NABOKOV_DESC:0 "Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov is a hereditary politician, born in the family of the Minister of Justice of the Russian Empire in 1869.\n\nIn 1905, he became one of the founders of the Kadet Party, and in 1906 he was elected a member of the First State Duma from St. Petersburg; twenty-eight times he appeared on the podium of the Duma — one of his famous speeches was delivered on May 13, 1906, when he challenged the government: '... from the point of view of the principle of popular representation, we can only say one thing: let the executive power submit to the legislative power.'\n\nAfter the February Revolution, he was the manager of the affairs of the Provisional Government. In May 1917, during the first crisis of the Provisional Government, Nabokov, along with P. Milyukov and A. Guchkov, resigned, after which he continued to work at the Legal Meeting under the Provisional Government, where he prepared a number of important legislative acts. He was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly from the Petrograd province, but did not participate in the meetings, and in 1919 he briefly left Russia, but returned the following year to participate in the new Constituent Assembly and was preparing for parliamentary elections.\n\nIn the post-war period, Nabokov became the recognized leader of the right-wing Kadets, the leader of its conservative wing. Unlike the left-wing Kadets, he was an irreconcilable monarchist, which brought him ideologically closer to the VNS party of moderate conservatives who wanted to restore the monarchy."
POLITICS_NIKOLAY_NEKRASOV_DESC:0 "Nikolay Vissarionovich Nekrasov was born into the family of a priest in 1879. From 1905 he actively participated in the political life of Russia. For some time he lived in Yalta, where he joined the Constitutional Democratic Party (People's Freedom Party), headed its Yalta branch, represented the Tauride province at the 1st constituent Congress of the Kadet Party.\n\nIn 1909-1915, he was a member of the Central Committee (CC) of the Kadet Party, the leader of its left wing, a supporter of active cooperation with socialist parties, resigned from the Central Committee, as the more moderate majority did not agree with his ideas. He was considered one of the most active deputies, spoke from the Duma rostrum more than 100 times. He mainly dealt with the problems of construction, railways and finance. He was a member of the Special Meeting on the Defense of the State. Together with A. Guchkov, he participated in the preparation of a conspiracy to oust Nicholas II, was a supporter of decisive action.\n\nDuring the February Revolution of 1917, he was a member of the Provisional Committee of the State Duma. On the night of March 3, he drafted a bill declaring Russia a republic, which caused sharp dissatisfaction with the leader of the Kadets, Pavel Milyukov, who considered Nekrasov an ambitious careerist and even a traitor. However, their relationship would later improve when Milyukov himself became a Republican in August 1917.  Later Nekrasov would become the last Russian governor of Finland.\n\nAfter the Civil War, he joined Milyukov's Republican faction in the Kadet Party, was briefly Minister of Economy until he was removed from this position on the initiative of Kerensky.\n\nHowever, due to the retirement of Pavel Milyukov from the office of prime minister, it was Nekrasov who became his successor and the leader of the "radical republican" faction as opposed to Nabokov's monarchists."

POLITICS_ALEKSANDR_POTRESOV_DESC:0 "Alexander Nikolaevich Potresov is a prominent figure of the Russian Social Democratic movement, one of the founders of the RSDRP.  In the early 1890s Potresov participated in the work of the social-democratic circles of P. B. Struve and Y. O. Martov, and in 1903 he became one of the organizers and leaders of the Menshevik Party.  In the following months, Potresov did a lot of work to inform European Social democracy about the ideological origins of the split of the RSDRP. Largely due to his activities, such prominent socialists as K. Kautsky and R. Luxemburg took the side of the Mensheviks.\n\nWith the outbreak of the First World War, Potresov became the leader of the patriotic trend of Russian social democracy (Menshevik Defencists). In May 1917, Potresov returned to Petrograd. Remaining the leader of the Menshevik Defencists, he defended the coalition Provisional Government, defending the idea of uniting the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the name of national unity and the triumph of statehood. Potresov categorically did not accept the October Revolution. He assessed it as 'the murder of democracy', and the political situation that developed after it as 'socialism of fools'.\n\nThe Extraordinary Congress of the RSDRP(o), held in November-December 1917, was dominated by sentiments with which Potresov categorically disagreed. He, along with his supporters, refused to participate in the elections of the Central Committee of the RSDRP(o). Potresov planned to formally withdraw from the party by the autumn of 1918, but his plans were hindered by the murder of Lenin and the transfer of the initiative to the hands of the white forces, and was perceived by Potresov as an opportunity to unite the Social Democrats around the Mensheviks.\n\nHis predictions about the mass transition of the workers' movement after the defeat of the Bolsheviks and the Left SRs were justified, and as a result, the Mensheviks took second place in the elections to the new constituent Assembly, but the internationalist Martov dominated the party. The split of the Mensheviks into leftists-internationalists, and right-wing moderates was obvious. In 1928, Potresov became the leader of the Menshevik Party, and already quite elderly, he now became the president of the republic - doing everything possible for the triumph of social democracy."

He was a delegate to the III and IV Congresses of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and in June 1917 he was elected to the Central Committee. He was the Mandatory candidate of the Socialist Revolutionary Party to the Constituent Assembly and at the end of 1917, he was elected there from the Perm electoral district.\n\nHe participated in the work of KOMUCH, where he became close to Vladimir Volsky, but in 1918 he was arrested by Kolchak intelligence, just to later be released by Czech Legionnaires.\n\nAfter the war, he was elected a deputy of the State Duma from the Socialist Revolutionaries, and was also able to be elected to the Senate in 1930 after its reform. Up until his election as president in 1936, Gerstein never made ideological speeches, but now it has become clear to everyone that he is quite radical and intends to do his best to achieve the adoption of the Socialist-Revolutionary land reform."

He escaped to Russia in June 1915 from the Carpathians, among many Slavs, at great risk to his life, he switched to the side of the Russian army. He was pardoned by the Tsar and left for the Serbian Volunteer Division. In July 1917, he achieved a transfer to the 8th army of General Kornilov and participated in battles. In the summer of 1917 he served in the Kornilov shock regiment. The Czech company under the command of Trushnovich remained loyal to General Kornilov after the failure of the Kornilov's Revolt in August 1917, until the general's departure to Bykhov, guarded him from a possible attack. By the end of the Civil War, he had gained a reputation as a loyal Kornilovets.\n\nIn 1934, he joined the Solidarists Party, and among them was elected to the Duma in 1936 under the mandate of the NPRP, and after the dissolution of the NPRP became one of the eccentric leaders of the solidarists. Being a supporter of a strong hand, as well as a Kornilov, Trushnovich pursues not so much the construction of a solidarist Russia, but also much more extensive goals - the main of which is the unification of all Slavs under the rule of Russia."

Having joined the fighting squad of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party at the beginning of the century, since then terror against the oppressors of the working people has become the meaning of life for it. And although many say that Spiridonova's role is overestimated, one cannot deny her perseverance and optimism in achieving goals. To the halo of the Great Martyr, she managed to add, largely thanks to populism, the fame of an emotional speaker, publicist and politician who defends peasant interests. John Reed called her at that moment 'the most popular and influential woman in Russia.'\n\nIn May 1917, she began to play one of the main roles among the Left SRs. Having joined the Organizational Bureau of the left wing of the party, she worked in the Petrograd organization, spoke in military units, among workers, calling for an end to the war, the transfer of land to the peasants, and power to the Soviets. Spiridonova was aware of the need for cooperation with the Bolsheviks. She believed that the influence of the Bolsheviks on the masses was temporary, and that the Bolsheviks would go bankrupt in the second stage of the revolution. And she was right. She characterized the Soviets as 'the fullest expression of the people's will.'\n\nAfter the uprising of the Left SRs and the break with the Bolsheviks, Spiridonova was kept in prison until Kerensky's amnesty in 1920. Having pieced together the Left SRs in the 1920s, adopting a new anarcho-syndicalist doctrine, Spiridonova was finally able to carry out the revolution."

RUS_communists:0 "PLSR/NSP Coalition Elected"
RUS_communists_desc:0 "Surprisingly, the popularity of the NSP and PLSR have both grown to the point that through begrudging cooperation, these two parties have been able to charm the masses and win a majority in the elections by forming an uneasy coalition. Despite their differing attitudes and plans for Russia, the NSP and PLSR are now glued together at the hip - each an independent head pulling the shared body in a different direction. Now let us see if this uneasy alliance can last."

RUS_Coalition_Only_In_Name:0 "A Coalition Only In Name"
RUS_Coalition_Only_In_Name_desc:0 "Despite the coalition between the NSP of Bukharin and PLSR of Spiridonova securing our democratic election, our cooperation is far from harmonious or peaceful. Ministers from both parties chomp at the bit, frothing at the mouth in an attempt to get their way over the wishes of their new ‘allies.’ Inter-party violence is rising, and cooperation seems like a dead ideal. It would seem that no matter what these two groups do, one will inevitably rise to dominate the other, for this coalition was little more than a stepping stool on the way to power, and both groups realize it."

RUS_Trade_Unions_Discussion:0 "Debate on the Future of Trade Unions"
RUS_Trade_Unions_Discussion_desc:0 "In order to organize some solid direction for our messy coalition, the topic of Trade Unions has been brought up within our chambers. The two main faces of our coalition, Bukharin and Spiridonova, each have their own views on how unions should be operated, organized, and what their purpose should be, but only one camp can come out on top. Bukharin firmly believes that all trade unions should be nationalized - that is, become state-owned and their activities should be subordinate to the state. Spiridonova, on the other hand, maintains the position that trade unions should be entirely free and autonomous, liberated from government restrictions or unnecessary oversight - claiming that only then will our workers truly be free. With both titans of the Russian Left making their cases well-known, it is now up to our congress to decide."

RUS_PLSR_Majority:0 "PLSR Majority"
RUS_PLSR_Majority_desc:0 "With the bulk of the coalition backing her calls for free trade unionism, the Left SRs of the PLSR under Spiridonova have risen to dominate the coalition, Now, as the majority-holding party in the state, there is little in the way that can stop President Spiridonova from achieving her liberty-infused Red dream for Russia."

RUS_NSP_Majority:0 "NSP Majority"
RUS_NSP_Majority_desc:0 "As the coalition’s majority rises to back his plans for state-controlled trade unionism, Bukharin and his NSP have risen to dominate the coalition and Russia as a whole. Rising as our President and ready to take the future head-on, Bukharin is ready to bring true, fair, and profitable Socialism to Russia."

RUS_Remember_The_July_Uprising_desc:0 "The violent July Days - a armed uprising similar to the earlier February Revolution but far more deeply crimson, both from the fervor of Socialist proletariat and from the blood spilled in the chaos - shall always be remembered by our state. These bloody days were the first major spontaneous eruption of the people’s desire for a better system - a Socialist system, and led to the first major crackdowns on our Soviets, with heroes such as Lenin being forced to flee and with fools like Trotsky being arrested. We shall not tolerate any fool who dares spit on this legacy, and on our noble pursuit of Soviet Democracy. Under our leadership, the July Revolution shall be redeemed as we march across Russia and finally free the peasant masses from their centuries-long oppression."

RUS_Fighting_Reactionaries:0 "Combat Reactionary Influences"
RUS_Fighting_Reactionaries_desc:0 "Throughout Russia, vile Reactionaries infiltrate our government, our armed forces, and every other noble institution we have come to command. These nationalists, monarchists, conservatives, and apolitical militarists, among others, must be slowly removed from positions of power and have their actions limited so that their taint can no longer infect our Proletarian Republic."

No, our party is composed only of true socialist revolutionaries who will not compromise with the bosses to liberate the people!"

RUS_Vanguard_Of_The_Revolution_desc:0 "We are the vanguard of the Russian revolution and workers in their struggle against the eternal bourgeois and reactionary oppressors! We are not like the Bolsheviks who deceived the people to better terrorize them or the so-called 'socialists' who allied themselves with the dictator Kerensky, the dog of the German imperialists. We are the only real socialist party, we have never betrayed the proletarians, and we are proud of it!"

RUS_Power_To_The_Local_Councils:0 "Power to the Local Councils"
RUS_Power_To_The_Local_Councils_desc:0 "The local soviets, or councils, established all across the country by the peasants masses should have more power when it comes to governing their home regions. These soviets shall be granted reasonable, safe levels of autonomy while still following the general partyline of Moscow. Outside their realms, our congress and our President reign supreme, but within each small and localized soviet, these councils shall be the main voice of governance."

RUS_Form_The_Homogeneous_Socialist_Government_desc:0 "We need to move towards creating a united government of all socialist parties.

By ensuring that our new government has ministers from all socialist parties, our state will be more stable."

RUS_General_Strike:0 "General Strike"
RUS_General_Strike_desc:0 "Our party cannot lead the revolt against the bourgeois oppressors alone! Of course we must also rely on the workers we represent and strive to liberate. An effective and popular means of action is the organization of large strikes through all Russia, these means having already succeeded in the French and British revolutions, to accelerate the process to overthrow of the bourgeois republic!"

RUS_Second_Black_Repartition:0 "The Second Black Repartition"
RUS_Second_Black_Repartition_desc:0 "The Black Repartition, was a Russian populist revolutionary movement founded in August 1879, this socialist and agrarian movement was only short-lived, with an existence of about 2 years, but was a symbol of the revolt of the Russian peasants and rural people against their oppressors. We are the heirs of this movement and we defend both rural and urban proletarians!"

RUS_Arrest_The_General_Staff:0 "Arrest the General Staff"
RUS_Arrest_The_General_Staff_desc:0 "The Russian Army that triumphed over the Bolsheviks is composed in great majority of offices, especially superior ones, ardently anti-socialist and reactionary that will not let us in any case liberate the proletariat that begs us to come to its aid, and already rumors are circulating that a coup d'etat against us would be prepared by these generous men. We must arrest these dangerous men to prevent them from harming us once we take direct revolutionary action."

RUS_Raise_The_Red_Banners_desc:0 "It's time to take action comrades! Forward proletarians, raise the red flags, hang your bosses, soon we will all cheerfully sing the Internationale in the streets of Petrograd emptied of the fat capitalists, the tsarist reactionaries of the army and the false democrats who have oppressed us so much in the past!

RUS_Power_To_The_Soviets_desc:0 "The liberal republic has served us well in launching the revolution, but we no longer need it! The hammer of the proletariat will destroy this rotten and falsely democratic structure to make way for a democracy of Soviets that will truly represent the interests of the people and let them express their opinions freely!"



RUS_Power_To_Trade_Unions:0 "Empower Trade Unions"
RUS_Power_To_Trade_Unions_desc:0 "Trade Unions are a noble institution. They protect our workers and laborers, giving them bargaining power and fair representation as a united and strong whole rather than leaving each individual to attempt to defend themselves. These truly democratic and free associations must be expanded across the nation and greatly empowered so that all Russian workers will come to eventually embrace this system."

RUS_Recreate_The_Cheka:0 "Recreate the Cheka"
RUS_Recreate_The_Cheka_desc:0 "The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, abbreviated as the VChK and far more commonly known as the Cheka, were created in 1917 as the first successful Soviet secret police force. These noble agents used to valiantly defend the Proletariat, ensuring their safety and the continuation of the Soviets. Obviously, the old order failed. However, we will not fall prey to their same mistakes, and to do so we will need protection. A new Cheka will be recreated, cleansed of its past sins and now by led by Left SRs. Under their watch, our people shall be safe from reactionaries and counterrevolutionaries."

RUS_Combat_Army_Mutiny:0 "Combat Army Mutineers"
RUS_Combat_Army_Mutiny_desc:0 "Many within the army do not agree with the direction we intend to take the nation, and in protest, thousands of soldiers and officers across our armed forces have mutinied en masse. This situation is slowly growing more dire, and if we do not act soon, we could have a major uprising on our hands - one led by an endless horde of our own veterans. In order to prevent revolution or even civil war, these mutineers must be dealt with - one way or another."

RUS_Revolutionary_Terror:0 "Necessary Revolutionary Terror"
RUS_Revolutionary_Terror_desc:0 "The foul reactionary dogs have violently opposed our regime, harassing our party officials and terrorizing the masses, leaving us no other option. With their reinstatement, it is time for the loyal Cheka to march out across the state to preserve the Revolution. Under their shining jackboots and with rifles in hand, they shall crush Russian reactionary thought once and for all!"

RUS_Labour_Collectives:0 "Promote Labour Collectives"
RUS_Labour_Collectives_desc:0 "To help represent the best interests of the Russian proletariat, we should establish Labour Collectives throughout the nation in order to pool our labor force together in pursuit of greater efficiency and easier organization. In these collectives, the disorganized and disparate workforce could be brought together into syndicates - each representing a different profession. With each syndicate run by the top minds or hands in each field, and with all resources they would need pooled into one central and easily accessible union, our workforce shall be carried into a prosperous Socialist future on the back of their own hard work."

RUS_social_ineq:0 "Fight Social Inequality"
RUS_social_ineq_desc:0 "It’s high time to focus on fighting the disparities in our system. We have to solve issues like income inequality, unfair wages, a corrupt and prejudiced justice system, and many more to help our oppressed proletariat. Social justice, Socialist liberties, and basic human rights shall all be upheld, granted, and guaranteed by our state, finally bringing justice and equality to the people of Russia."

RUS_cooperative_unions:0 "Establish Cooperative Unions"
RUS_cooperative_unions_desc:0 "If workers have their own organizations now, why should consumers not be in the same position? Cooperative Unions should be established to give them representation as well. Our people shall be allowed and even incentivized to live communally in domestic communes and cooperatives. Pooling resources and funds, sharing labors, and raising children as a group or new village will form greater bonds between our people while further increasing national efficiency."

RUS_Socialization_Of_Land_plsr:0 "Socialization of Land"
RUS_Socialization_Of_Land_plsr_desc:0 "The core of our reforms is the system of Land Socialization. Though our detractors say it is merely Nationalization, that is when land belongs to the state. However, when it belongs to people, it is a far more noble and fair institution - Socialization. Private ownership of Russia’s land shall be a thing of the past, for this vast, bountiful, and beautiful expanse that we call home shall now be collectively and equally owned by the expansive Russian proletariat."

RUS_village_communes:0 "Create Village Communes"
RUS_village_communes_desc:0 "We know that mass collectivization is impossible to achieve in our time, for it shall be a labor generations will have to work on for decades to come. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t begin this process gradually now. By conjoining nearby villages and domestic cooperatives together, we can create Village Communes, bolstering the spirit of community and cooperation among the masses while reducing the logistical and organizational strain on the apparatus of state."

RUS_Syndical_Cooperative_Federation:0 "Syndical-Cooperative Federation"
RUS_Syndical_Cooperative_Federation_desc:0 "It is necessary to divide the management of society between political and economic councils. The first, elected from the workers of certain territories and/or enterprises, will concentrate in their hands the functions of defense and ensuring order. The latter, created by elected representatives of industrial and consumer associations of workers (syndicates - unions of self-governing enterprises and cooperative unions), will manage economic life, deciding what, how and for whom to produce. The various branches of government of the soviets will balance each other, preventing abuse."

RUS_Denounce_Kerenskyism_nsp_desc:0 "Despite being a member of the PSR, a nominally socialist party, Kerensky is far from being one of us, and he proved it during his eternal quasi-dictatorial presidency, where he pacted with the German imperialists and the reactionary aristocrats of the Senate.  We must formally denounce the former President and his decisions before we can show the people what true socialism is."

RUS_A_Perfect_Model:0 "A Perfect Model"
RUS_A_Perfect_Model_desc:0 "We must take as our model of governance the socialist society as theorized by Marx and Engels in their numerous writings, only by having established such a society the proletariat can be truly free and fulfilled, some criticize the fact that we will never achieve such a result in a peaceful way, calling us 'revisionists' to the thought of Marx and Lenin, we are going to prove them wrong during the course of our mandate, which was acquired by the popular vote."

RUS_Introduce_NEP:0 "Introduce the NEP"

RUS_Allow_Small_Traders_nsp:0 "Allow Small Traders"
RUS_Allow_Small_Traders_nsp_desc:0 "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."

RUS_Capitalism_In_The_Village:0 "Capitalism in the Village"
RUS_Capitalism_In_The_Village_desc:0 "The NEP, as theorized by Bukharin, in order to arrive one day at a socialist society, must pass through the establishment of what is called 'capitalism in the village', Russia not being developed enough to pass directly to socialism, our economy remaining poor and agrarian. A market system will be set up between peasant communities in order to increase agricultural production and develop our economy."

RUS_Socialism_In_The_City:0 "Socialism in the City"
RUS_Socialism_In_The_City_desc:0 "Where the establishment of socialism in the countryside must necessarily pass through a moderate and temporary capitalism, the industrial cities are already ready to welcome socialism as the workers demand.

RUS_Smychka:0 "Promote \"Smychka\""
RUS_Smychka_desc:0 "Smychka is, in short, the unity between workers and peasants. To achieve true equality we cannot focus only on the urban proletariat. We have to promote the cooperation between the urban and the rural community."

RUS_Khozraschyot_nsp:0 "Khozraschyot"
RUS_Khozraschyot_nsp_desc:0 "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."

RUS_Support_Kulaks:0 "Support Kulaks"
RUS_Support_Kulaks_desc:0 "Kulaks are those peasants that are more “well off”, with greater amount of land than most, but they are still peasants that need our help. We are not some bloodthirsty revolutionaries that want to kill them, the NEP shall support the Kulak class."

RUS_Cautious_Industrialization_nsp:0 "Cautious Industrialization"
RUS_Cautious_Industrialization_nsp_desc:0 "The super industrialism of the left-wing of the party will lead to a massive state bureaucracy which will dominate over the proletariat. Only a moderate industrialisation, one which also preserves the Smychka, which is a necessary requirement in the short-term, will be a successful one, preventing many issues in its path."

RUS_Foreign_Concessions:0 "Foreign Concessions"
RUS_Foreign_Concessions_desc:0 "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."

RUS_Fate_Of_Duma_and_Senate:0 "Fate of the Duma and the Senate"
RUS_Fate_Of_Duma_and_Senate_desc:0 "We shall attempt to get rid off the elements of bourgeois democracy or reform them at least. Without them on our way, our future will be bright."

RUS_Future_Of_The_Republic:0 "Proclaim Socialist Republic"
RUS_Future_Of_The_Republic_desc:0 "With our initial reforms implemented and the great support of the people, it is logical for our government to proclaim the establishment of a true socialist and democratic structure. Some people think that this is a betrayal of our principles of peaceful revolution, but it is only logical to fulfill the will of the people who elected us, we will no longer be restricted by bourgeois democracy under this system!"

RUS_Second_Term_Of_NSP:0 "Second Term of NSP"
RUS_Second_Term_Of_NSP_desc:0 "The people have once again put their trust in us by electing us once again!

RUS_Bukharin_Plan:0 "Bukharin Plan"
RUS_Bukharin_Plan_desc:0 "Bukharin, the leader of our party, is best suited to lead us and with his plan for our second term, our success with the workers is assured.

RUS_Kirov_Plan:0 "Kirov Plan"
RUS_Kirov_Plan_desc:0 "The second man of the party, Sergei Kirov has the perfect plan to lead our country and the NSP to the best. He intends to continue the successful economic policy of NEP as theorized by Bukharin, but also to start a slow industrialization process to modernize the country. He will also try to apply Lenin's theory of democratic centralism in the best possible way even in a liberal political system."

RUS_Control_Trade_Unions_nsp:0 "Control Trade Unions"
RUS_Control_Trade_Unions_nsp_desc:0 "We currently have a parallelism of unions and the administrative organs, an issue which needs to be remedied. While this we will also have to change the essence of unions, from 'trade' unions to 'production' unions. The newly created administrative-economic apparatus will be democratically elected by the workers, with broad mass assemblies of all economic-production measures."

RUS_Go_On_With_NEP:0 "Go On With NEP"
RUS_Go_On_With_NEP_desc:0 "The NEP has been able to show its importance during these last years, the agricultural production having strongly increased and the peasants praising the government of the NSP in their villages. Although the measure must remain temporary in order to establish socialism, we have no good reason to stop it now while it is working so well and we will therefore continue this successful policy!"

RUS_Tax_The_Workers:0 "Tax the Workers"
RUS_Tax_The_Workers_desc:0 "The workers already have an established socialist economic environment as stated in the NEP, we must tax them in order to free up more funds for the peasants who are still in the capitalist economic stage in order to facilitate their transition to socialism. The urban workers owe their rural brethren a great deal of assistance; they are both united in their desire to achieve a perfect socialist society."

RUS_The_New_Leninism:0 "The New Leninism"
RUS_The_New_Leninism_desc:0 "Unfortunately, for too many people, Leninism means dictatorship, massacre, bloodshed and oppression. Bukharin, the legitimate heir of Vladimir Lenin, has shown them that Leninism is democratic, popular and provides services to the poorest, the Bolshevik party in exile in France can call us traitors or revisionists as much as they want, we have made much more progress in Russia than they will ever do."

RUS_Soyuzmultfilm:0 "Rusmultfilm"
RUS_Soyuzmultfilm_desc:0 "We have created an animation studio composed of talented individuals from all over the union, as well as with the support and expertise of foreign defectors from Japan and the USA, built from the nationalized carcass of the two largest animator groups based in Moscow. Rebuilt and rebranded, this new, state-run institution is expected to bring the joys of Socialist thought to the masses, and especially to our youth, through pre-approved programming and quality animation. Already, Rusmultfilm has begun to touch the hearts of thousands across Russia as masters of the craft such as Ivan Ivanov-Vano, Vladimir Suteev, Olga Khodataeva, Vladimir Polkovnikov, Leonid Amalrik, the Brumberg sisters, and many others work endlessly to churn out new media for the masses to consume. With these enlightening, entertaining hand-drawn animations being churned out, we shall entice and educate the masses with the true glory of Socialist artistic expression."

RUS_Fight_Bureaucratization:0 "Fight Bureaucratization"
RUS_Fight_Bureaucratization_desc:0 "The fight against the bureaucracy is a constant struggle, something Lenin already well understood. We will have to continue Comrade Lenin’s fight against the bureaucracy, before it can take hold like a tick and drain our state’s lifeblood of liberty and equality; something we must avoid at all costs. We will also have to train a new class of truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the scores of reactionary swine that still infest our administration."

RUS_Fight_The_Urban_Rural_Conflict_desc:0 "In our land there is a great struggle between the cities and the countryside, between the developed lands and the deprived farmlands, between factory workers and peasants. One of our first steps in preserving the revolution is to overcome this divide so that we may combine our efforts against the oppressors rather than bickering among ourselves."

RUS_The_New_Proletarian_Generation:0 "The New Proletarian Generation"
RUS_The_New_Proletarian_Generation_desc:0 "The new generation of proletarians that will be born in Sergei Kirov's Russia will not have to experience, or at least to a great extent, the oppression that their parents and grandparents experienced before them, they will flourish in a socialist society where they will have a prime minister who really listens to their claims and demands.  Every proletarian will be proud to have participated in the foundation of this ideal society, and our newspapers will not fail to highlight this."

RUS_Mild_Industrialization:0 "Mild Industrialisation"
RUS_Mild_Industrialization_desc:0 "Russia cannot be satisfied with keeping the same agrarian structure forever! On the contrary, it must work on modernizing itself in order to have a society similar to that of France or Great Britain. Where some people say that it is necessary to industrialize as quickly as possible, Sergei Kirov knows that the economic and human cost would be catastrophic for the country. Therefore, we have to start a moderate industrialization process in order to get the best results for the country and the people."

RUS_Democratic_Centralism:0 "Democratic Centralism"
RUS_Democratic_Centralism_desc:0 "Just as Lenin theorized the doctrine of democratic centralism and essential to the proper functioning of the socialist party. Each member has of course the right to have his own opinion, to express it and to debate as he likes, hence the democratic aspect, but once a decision is taken collectively all the members must conform to it and work together as best as possible to the concrete application of the decision taken. This principle is therefore essential and must be applied without exception."

RUS_Peoples_Prime_Minister_desc:0 "With his numerous actions and charismatic speeches, the 'People's Prime Minister' as he is called, Sergei Kirov proved his talent and abilities to the whole people who never felt closer to one of their leaders. It is difficult to walk through Petrograd without coming across groups of workers singing happily to the glory of Kirov, Lenin and socialism. Our efforts were not in vain and Sergei Kirov will be remembered as one of the best leaders Russia has ever known!"

Believing that a Socialist Party should make the conditions ripe for Socialist Revolution, while not actively starting said revolution, they certainly have some more radical ideas than most. It remains to be seen if the ever fractious left can govern."

RUS_Fissures_Among_Mensheviks:0 "Fissures Among Mensheviks"
RUS_Fissures_Among_Mensheviks_desc:0 "Simmering tensions within the Mensheviks have seemingly boiled over today as reports from meetings among the Party leadership has revealed deeply believed differences in policy. They broadly fall into two camps, the Internationalists who seek to bring the Mensheviks back to their Revolutionary days to overthrow the capitalist state and the Moderates, who want to work within the bounds of the law to reform the state. The leaders have so far agreed to keep their disagreements behind closed doors but at the coming Congress all bets are off as to who will come out on top."

RUS_VI_Congress_Of_RSDRP_desc:0 "It is finally here. With the election of the RSDRP to national leadership the party itself has been pushed to select a leader to, well, lead. The obvious choice is the current leader of the Party, Alexander Potresov; however the growing Internationalist faction of the party see him as a class traitor and bourgeois infiltrator. The Congress has been planned and convened soon and armed guards are ready to break up what seems like inevitable inter-delegate violence.

RUS_Internationalists_desc:0 "In a stunning upset the Internationalists have seized control of the Congress and elected their own leaders into critical positions within the Party.

Meanwhile the RSDRP enters a new revolutionary phase, not unlike the Bolsheviks all those years ago."

RUS_Moderates:0 "Moderates"
RUS_Moderates_desc:0 "In a hard won victory the Moderates have wrangled the Congress into reaffirming Potresov’s mandate. The Internationalists are furious and have threatened to break off from the Party altogether but Potresov is confident that they will stay. Meanwhile he leads the Mensheviks into the future, forming Russia into a nation the Russian worker can finally be proud to serve."

RUS_Connections_With_Communards_desc:0 "The first thing on the agenda for the resurgent Internationalists is to reach out to our revolutionary brothers in Paris. Many old Bolsheviks fled there after the failure of the Revolution and while the Government is loath to let them back in, the Paris government can still be useful. French advisors and resources are already on the way to Russia as the new state finally joins the international Socialist struggle. A new dawn is breaking, and all the world will bask in Russia’s light."

RUS_Reassure_The_Workers_desc:0 "The chaos of the Congress has unsettled our core power base, the Russian worker. They are uneasy about all the shouting and fighting that went on in those chaotic days. Besides, they might support the other side and could resent the government. We must work fast to assure them that the Party stands behind its elected leader, totally and without reservation."

RUS_Revolutionary_Democracy:0 "Revolutionary Democracy"
RUS_Revolutionary_Democracy_desc:0 "While the Moderates want to shape the unwieldy Kerensky System into a new and better form, the Internationalists have no such delusions. A system built by the bourgeois will only aid the bourgeoisie, never the worker. If the Russian People are to finally experience true Socialist liberty, the whole system must be rebuilt from the ground up not to support big business and finance, but to help the middle class and poor."

RUS_Oust_Liberals_Conservatives_desc:0 "In our new government we will not abide by bourgeois lapdogs. This means that the Conservatives and the Liberals must go. The Conservatives make sense to expel. They will never agree with us and must be dealt with now and dealt with harshly before they marshal their resources to overturn the new regime. However we have met resistance in expelling the Liberals. Moderate Mensheviks say this action would needlessly alienate them when we need them most. This matters nothing to us. The Liberals did nothing to help the People and will be punished just like the oppressors they claimed to oppose."

Any step out of line would only give the boss an excuse to fire him and replace him with someone more agreeable.

Before the Weltkrieg they were limited to a Pale of Settlement in Western Russia and even still faced anti semetic pogroms and attacks. This distrust is misplaced and the Mensheviks know of this.

RUS_Cooperation_With_Liberals_desc:0 "The Liberals are misguided but their heart is in the right place. WIth our ascension to power we have been met with a flood of defections from the Liberal Party and those that stayed with them have been willing to come to the table.

RUS_Workers_Self_Governance:0 "Workers' Self-Governance"
RUS_Workers_Self_Governance_desc:0 "The Worker knows how best to run his plant, or at the very least knows better than some stuffy suit who's never worked an honest day in his life. We must give freedom back to the worker and allow for the unions at various industries to form councils to run factories, or elect managers to run said factories. This will give the workers more of a say in how and when they work and raise morale."

RUS_Emergence_Of_Farmers:0 "Emergence of Farmers"
RUS_Emergence_Of_Farmers_desc:0 "The rural farmers have long been a politically inert faction of our population. What movements they did grow were usually put down by the old government harshly.

RUS_Expand_The_Public_Sector_desc:0 "The government should not manage the economy. The red tape it would leave behind would strangle industry in its cradle, not to mention the numerous layers of bureaucracy would leave the entire industrial sector crawling with inefficiencies and nepotism.

RUS_Denounce_Senate_Authoritarianism:0 "Denounce Senatorial Authoritarianism"
RUS_Denounce_Senate_Authoritarianism_desc:0 "Under Kerensky the Senate took on a more and more prominent role within the Government. While the President remained more powerful than them, the power the Senate did accrue made them much more powerful than the originators of our system of government intended. Not to mention many Senators are opposed to us in one way or another.

RUS_soc_land_blocked_desc:0 "The reactionaries in the Senate have united against us! The Land Socialization Bill was gutted and then thrown out entirely. Russia has not gotten the relief it demands.

RUS_Move_Left:0 "Move Left"
RUS_Move_Left_desc:0 "The failure of the Bill has boosted the left wing of the Party. While similar to the Left SR’s the MPSR has managed to steer the Party agenda more to the left than previously. This signals a sharp deviation from the moderate left wing populism we once ascribed too and has driven the NRPR away from us entirely.

RUS_Deal_With_Conservative_Officers_desc:0 "The Army is a traditional hotbed of reaction. Throughout history counterrevolutionaries have used the Army as their base of support to crush the people. This is most true with the Russian Army who has an army corps made mostly of former White officers who fought the Bolsheviks in the Civil War. They will never accept the new order we are trying to build. We must deal with them before we finish the Revolution or risk a dagger to the back in our moment of greatest triumph."

RUS_Enlist_Army_Support:0 "Enlist Army Support"
RUS_Enlist_Army_Support_desc:0 "While the Officer Corps is generally skeptical of our aims, the rank and file have been a breeding ground for leftist thought. This was proven during the Civil War when many Army units mutinied against their officers to join the Bolsheviks. While we are not Bolsheviks and don't want to push the common soldier into mutiny, we will bring them over to our side. That way if we miss a reactionary officer any move against us can be prevented by the brave soldiers."

The defeat of the Bolsheviks was a crushing blow, but that didn't end the promise of the inevitable Revolution, just delayed it long enough for the reactionaries to be lulled into a false sense of security. Now however, with the Left PSR triumphant they have realized their folly. We have struggled, and now we have won."

We will reform the Combat Squads into a national gendarmerie to keep the far left terrorists from striking against us like they have so often in the past.

RUS_Republican_Party_Of_Russia_desc:0 "The PSR and NRPR have become so intertwined that its almost impossible to tell them apart. For that reason we will announce the two parties are one once more and form a new Party, the Republican Party of Russia. This will finally push away what remaining left leaning members we have managed to retain but it will draw in more right wing members to make up the loss.

RUS_Empower_The_President:0 "Empower the President"
RUS_Empower_The_President_desc:0 "The idea, proposed jointly by some PSR and most of KDP deputies is to make the President elected by the population, instead of the Senate.

While we are not ready to take the final step to unify totally, at least not yet, we will adopt some aspects of the Kadet platform to further cement our coalition. This will draw us closer to the political center and alienate those on the left and right wings, but Russia is a centrist nation. To turn away from that would only bring defeat to us."

RUS_Stay_Separate:0 "Stay Separate"
RUS_Stay_Separate_desc:0 "While some members in both our parties have suggested we finally unify the Kadets and PSR we can't. The Kadets have a strong platform of putting Russia on a path to Constitutional Monarchy. This is simply incompatible with the PSR’s platform and history of resisting the Tsar in every form.

RUS_Reassure_Unity_With_NRPR:0 "Reassure Unity With NRPR"
RUS_Reassure_Unity_With_NRPR_desc:0 "Our recent election has brought nervous rumblings that the PSR will finally break away from our new coalition partners. However to the informed observer it’s plain to see that the PSR needs the NRPR just as much as the NRPR needs the PSR. If we are to maintain power we must keep with Savinkov, at least for now. We will put these rumors to rest with a grand show of unity between the two."

RUS_Secularism_Prevails:0 "Secularism Prevails"
RUS_Secularism_Prevails_desc:0 "Russia has traditionally had very strong religious roots. These roots were pulled up by the Revolution and Civil War however. While the NRPR generally favors maintaining Russia’s ties to the Orthodox Church, the PSR knows Russia is a nation of many religions. Jews, Muslims, Christians of many denominations, even some Buddhists. If we tie our horse to the Patriarch we will alienate all the non-Orthodox in our lands. We must stay secular."

RUS_Fund_Religious_Institutions:0 "Fund Religious Organisations"
RUS_Fund_Religious_Institutions_desc:0 "Russia is and forever shall be a nation of Christians. We host the true Patriarch of Constantinople in Moscow, our people follow the faith as it was and we know it to be. We will harness this religiosity to aid the state by pouring money into religious charities and institutions. This will ingratiate us to the Patriarch who will pay us back with having his priests support us. Many peasants trust their priest resolutely, now they will trust us as well."

RUS_Adopt_A_New_Party_Programme:0 "Adopt a New Party Programme"
RUS_Adopt_A_New_Party_Programme_desc:0 "With the NRPR and PSR tied together so closely its become apparent that we must adapt the party to the new reality. We will drop some of the more left wing tenants of our platform and shift the party to the right. What few left wing holdouts remain within our ranks will leave sure but we have compartmentalized them into irrelevance ages ago so it's no real loss."

RUS_Say_No_To_Capitalism:0 "Oppose Capitalism"
RUS_Say_No_To_Capitalism_desc:0 "The PSR and NRPR have one major pillar in common, opposition to capitalism. The system is broken on a fundamental level, exploiting the peasantry for the gain of men too rich to notice. Now we will push actively for the reform of capitalism to better benefit the peasants and common man. This will anger the upper crust, but they hated us already."

RUS_Fight_Corruption:0 "Fight Corruption"
RUS_Fight_Corruption_desc:0 "Russia is plagued by corruption on every level. Everybody is out for themselves and for every good man in government, there are a dozen bad ones. If Russia is to thrive we must strike these kleptocrats and destroy them. When we replace them with competent loyalists only then will the regime be truly safe from failure."

RUS_Promote_Left_Nationalism:0 "Promote Left Nationalism"
RUS_Promote_Left_Nationalism_desc:0 "The Left has a history of internationalism, of thinking that humanity should think of itself as a species rather than a collection of nations. This is the wrong thought. Humanity is full of different peoples and cultures and to try to erase them would only bring chaos. We must promote nationalism among the left, or what’s left of it, and draw more of them to our side and shore up our support."

RUS_Russian_Socialism:0 "Russian Socialism"
RUS_Russian_Socialism_desc:0 "Marx had a very narrow idea of Socialism, coming from and being anchored by a strong class of industrial workers. Russia does not have such a class. Any socialism in Russia will be built from the more plentiful peasant class, a class that Marx saw as unfit or unable to lead such a revolution. We will prove him wrong."

RUS_Citizens_Instead_Of_Nation_desc:0 "We work for the people not for the nation. While we are more nationalist than previously, that should not distract us from our purpose to further the prosperity of the majority of the Russian people, the peasants. We will work hard to see our people prosper, and when we finally succeed we will bask in the glow of the new Gold Age along with them."

RUS_Strong_Government:0 "Strong Government"
RUS_Strong_Government_desc:0 "The union with the NRPR has taken a major force of chaos off the streets. Now in government the PSR-NRPR coalition has created the first truly strong government in Russia’s history. Kerensky was a hack, our enemies are anarchists and despots, only we can show Russia true freedom and we will do so for the foreseeable future."

RUS_New_Constitution:0 "New Constitution"
RUS_New_Constitution_desc:0 "Despite the new legislation having the name of 'Constitutional Amendments', in fact, there are so many, that the Constitution can be seen as completely new.

RUS_liberal:0 "KDP Elected"
RUS_liberal_desc:0 "The Liberal Kadets have won enough of the electorate to form a shaky government. Divisions both inside and outside the party threaten it and Russia itself with division and extinction. Feelings are tense as the Kadets, who are a rather large coalition ranging from former Tsarist officers to liberal democrats, step into the forefront of power and decide just who they want to lead themselves, and Russia as a whole, into the future.."

RUS_Milyukov_Experience:0 "Nekrasov's Experience"
RUS_Milyukov_Experience_desc:0 "Nikolay Nekrasov and his leftists are distrusted by many within the Party. Many see them as little more than Mensheviks or even Syndicalists. They however, are wrong and have been proven so. Rallying a base of dissatisfied middle class voters Nobokov has managed to unite the party behind his progressive agenda. Under his leadership the Kadets will no doubt steer to the left, but just how far remains to be seen."

RUS_Nabokov_Authority:0 "Nabokov's Authority"
RUS_Nabokov_Authority_desc:0 "Vladimir Nabokov is an old hat in government, having served the state since the time of the Tsars. While this has left him a staunch conservative and even a restorationist, this has also left him with more connections than Nekrasov. This has led to a degree of authority over the party and the political sphere that few can realistically match, the army notwithstanding. With him at the head of the Kadets the party is posed to take a more conservative stance than usual, though whether he will out and out restore the Tsar is an open question."

RUS_The_New_Tactic:0 "The New Tactics"
RUS_The_New_Tactic_desc:0 "To get the largely conservative political sphere on his side Nekrasov has to use innovative tactics. Some of the weaker men can be bullied into submission by party bosses. Others require a certain amount of wheeling and dealing and compromise. Still others are going to be next to impossible to win over and need to be dealt with, one way or another. All of this sets Nekrasov up for a delicate political dance that he must conduct within his narrow window on stage left. If he moves too far left, the party will fracture, if he moves too far right he will lose power. Politics is a dirty game, and Nekrasov is about to dive head first into the mud."

RUS_Reach_Out_To_Peasantry:0 "Reach Out To Peasantry"
RUS_Reach_Out_To_Peasantry_desc:0 "Much of the peasantry has been brainwashed to believe that anything left of center is tantamount to totalism and an anathema to the Russian people. Nekrasov concedes their wariness of the ascendent left is not wholly unjustified; the memories of the Civil War are still fresh in many Russian’s minds, but he will prove that just because he is a leftist doesnt mean he is a Syndicalist, much less a fucking Bolshevik. With the peasantry on our side we will have a powerful voter base to lean on if things get hairy."

RUS_Appease_The_Socialists:0 "Appease the Workers"
RUS_Appease_The_Socialists_desc:0 "The workers in the city are primed for Nekrasov’s ideals. Many of them are already leftists in some sense and should be able to be easily lured over to the Kadets rather than the PSR or NSP. With the peasantry as our bedrock, we can turn the workers into our body, moving the party forwards in the eyes of the average man. With agitators on the street we can drown out dissension and boost our influence in the national arena."

RUS_National_Agrarian_Fund_kdp_desc:0 "For every kulak there are a hundred poor farmers just barely scraping by. We must help them to keep them from going broke and getting bought out by megafarms. The Fund will extend non-repayable loans to the farmers in most need and loans with low interest rates to the rest of the farmers that meet certain parameters. Our finance minister has warned of the cost but we know that it will pay off in the long run. It has to."

RUS_Remember_The_Progressives:0 "Remember the Progressives"
RUS_Remember_The_Progressives_desc:0 "The Progressives were a small group of liberal senators who were attached to our party early on and were eventually subsumed. Their electoral history was abysmal but their ideals of a liberal society, united and free from interference. Nekrasov sympathises with their vision and while they may be long gone, their platform shall be dug up and rolled into our own. The torch of liberalism will continue to burn brightly in Russia."

RUS_Reform_The_Senate_kdp:0 "Let the People Vote"
RUS_Reform_The_Senate_kdp_desc:0 "The idea, proposed jointly by some PSR and most of KDP deputies is to make the President elected by the population, instead of the Senate. Therefore, the Senate will lose its right to appoint the President they want. Moreover, the President will be now supervised by the Government, which will remove the Senate's right to do it as well."

RUS_Embrace_Federalism:0 "Embrace Federalism"
RUS_Embrace_Federalism_desc:0 "Russia is a land of diverse peoples and cultures. To lump them all under one commanding authority would spell disaster. Instead we will institute a leveled system of administration with more autonomy given to the states. With limited government oversight these nations would be able to more effectively manage their own affairs and keep the people in line. Not to mention it would protect the rich cultural heritage of our different cultures."

RUS_Principle_Of_One_And_Indivisible_desc:0 "All of the people of the Motherland are Russians. Kalmyks, Komi, Siberians and Karelians are just labels used to rile up undue resistance. We will reinforce our historical principle that the Russian people will be ruled by Russians from Russia. This may infringe on their cultures and in some cases religion but any resistance will be short lived when the profits of our prosperity reach their pockets. Money can melt even the coldest heart."

RUS_Decentralize_Power:0 "Decentralize Power"
RUS_Decentralize_Power_desc:0 "Russia is a big country and lacks more federalization. We are a Federation on paper - we should be a Federation in reality. We must create local parliaments in every region and expand the powers of those already existing to make sure that every voice is heard."

RUS_Empower_The_Duma:0 "Empower the Duma"
RUS_Empower_The_Duma_desc:0 "The Duma is the People's House. It is filled with representatives elected directly from the people. As such it has recently leaned more liberal than the Senate. For the longest it played second fiddle to the Senate which has allowed the government to disregard the will of the people, well no more! We will strengthen the Duma to bring it to its rightful place of prominence in government and force the Senate and those that come after us to keep the people’s opinions in their political equations. "

RUS_Talk_To_Senators:0 "Talk To Senators"
RUS_Talk_To_Senators_desc:0 "Nabokov has extensive contacts in the Senate. We must call in our outstanding favors and wield our influence like a club to solidify our still shaky mandate. Decades of wheeling and dealing has prepared Nabokov for this day but the left wing of the party is in revolt. By calling in said favors we can crush this revolt in the cradle and survive the inevitable vote of no confidence. Then we can get to work and fix the mess left by our predecessor."

RUS_Old_Deal:0 "The Old Deal"
RUS_Old_Deal_desc:0 "The oligarchs have long had an informal agreement with the government. The government wouldn’t step on their toes if they worked with us. This deal was broken by Kerensky and his incompetence but if we reached out to our friends we can reestablish the deal. Not only would this benefit us politically but it might lead to a growth in the economy as well. "

RUS_Connections_In_Senate:0 "Connections In The Senate"
RUS_Connections_In_Senate_desc:0 "Not only will we harness our existing connections in the senate but we should expand our network within the body. The recent years have raised a lot of men to prominence. These new men are politically vulnerable and weak. We can brown beat them into submission pretty easily and gain even more of a hold on the most important legislative body within Russia."

RUS_Control_Trade_Unions:0 "Control the Trade Unions"
RUS_Control_Trade_Unions_desc:0 "The people will largely be out of our reach for the foreseeable future. They have been thoroughly infiltrated by leftists and far rightists making many of them at best hostile to our government. However, they are largely influenced by their local trade unions. Many of these unions are supporters of the Syndicalists and poisoning the minds of our citizens! We must pass a law giving the government final say over the leadership of major trade unions. Only then can we be sure they are not spouting revolutionary filth into the malleable hearts of the public."

RUS_Russian_Liberalism:0 "Russian Liberalism"
RUS_Russian_Liberalism_desc:0 "Russian liberalism is different from the West. In the west they talk about shrinking the government, focusing on social issues and a hands off approach to most things. Here in Russia we have noticed the errors in such thought. While we do share some similarities to our Western cousins, Russian liberalism will champion the states right to safeguard the people. The people have a narrow view of the world, we know what things are really like. We will make the hard decisions so our people can bask in the happiness, freedom and peace that we have given them."

RUS_Full_Land_Privatization:0 "Full Land Privatisation"
RUS_Full_Land_Privatization_desc:0 "The only way to solve the land issue - is to give it back into private hands - so both peasants, workers, businessmen... every citizen could enjoy the benefits of private ownership."

RUS_Lower_The_Influence_Of_Local_Parliaments_desc:0 "The local parliaments and the whole division of our territory is considered to be a rather stupid decision. Our country shall be centralized in order for the government and central authorities to have full power in all Russian villages and cities."

RUS_Capitalism_Will_Prosper_In_Russia:0 "Capitalism Will Prosper In Russia"
RUS_Capitalism_Will_Prosper_In_Russia_desc:0 "Capitalism is the best economic system humans have come up with. That is why so much of the world follows it. The Syndicalist economy languishes in stagnation while we will encourage the natural growth of our economy into the juggernaut it must naturally become. Through targeted investments and loosened regulations we will unleash the natural capital of our state and watch it catapult Russia into prosperity."

RUS_Empower_The_President_kdp:0 "Presidential Republic"
RUS_Empower_The_President_kdp_desc:0 "The idea, suggested, is making Russia a presidential republic with a strong executive, who will be elected by all Russian citizens. In other words, the president now will be independent from the Parliament, and he will appoint the Prime-Minister with the Duma's consent, of course. If the Bill will be adopted, then the extraordinary Presidential elections will be held."

RUS_Reform_The_Judicial_System:0 "Reform the Judicial System"
RUS_Reform_The_Judicial_System_desc:0 "The judicial system is a biased and flawed system. It was thrown together in the moment and built upon itself with little legal or even logical sense. To fix it we have hired a council of the most preeminent lawyers in the nation to sort through all the various and sometimes contradictory legal rulings and inject some logic in an area that has desperately needed it."

RUS_Tax_Reform:0 "Tax Reform"
RUS_Tax_Reform_desc:0 "Just like the law our tax code is in need of reform. Not only does it wring a lot of people's money out of their pockets but it has so many tax breaks and provisions that few people can do it themselves and instead have turned to a burgeoning industry of tax lawyers to do their taxes for them. Not only that but it changes every single year, sometimes radically. We must get a leash on our unwieldy tax code and turn it into the effective but fair system that everybody wishes it was."

RUS_Antimonopoly_Commission_desc:0 "The oligarchs have undue influence. They control vast fiefdoms within our economy and are quick to stamp out any innovation or competition. An uncompetitive economy is a failed economy. To combat these giants of industry we will form a special Monopolies Commission whose sole job is to wield the Russian legal apparatus against these companies to hopefully break them up and breathe some life into our sometimes stale economic sphere."

Progress waits for nobody. It will come, with our without us."

RUS_Presidents_Mainstay_desc:0 "The President is the highest office in the land. The Kadets have shown this to be true. We will work to strengthen the office along American lines. With a strong executive we can fight off any attempts at radicalization by the fickle feelings of the people while pushing our agenda through the machine of government as painlessly as possible. Some fear we will return to the days of Kerensky’s days of petty presidential dictatorship but we won't, we can't, if we are to continue to call ourselves Kadets."

RUS_A_Fair_Salary_desc:0 "While the worker slaves away for a pittance his comfy boss lazes the years away and makes several times the workers annual income every day. This is to be expected to a certain extent, the boss slaved away for years, decades even, to get where he is. To rob him of his earned comfort would be Syndicalism. However to leave the Russian worker out to dry is unconscionable. We will mandate that a worker's wage will be a certain percentage of his bosses, fixed to inflation. This will not only give many hard working Russians much deserved raises but it will not anger the capitalists of our nation while not devaluing any arbitrarily fixed raise by natural inflation."

RUS_The_Republican_Democratic_Party:0 "The Radical Democratic Party"
RUS_The_Republican_Democratic_Party_desc:0 "The Kadet’s turn to the left is complete. The right has more or less abandoned us to their inevitable marginalization.

RUS_Reasonable_Concessions:0 "Reasonable Concessions"

RUS_Strong_Executive:0 "Strong Executive"
RUS_Strong_Executive_desc:0 "The executive is where the power lies. It is the most outwards facing office and is where all government information is consolidated and processed.

RUS_The_New_Progressive_Party_desc:0 "What we once absorbed has now absorbed us. The Progressives within our Party have managed to centralize the party and have formed it among their own lines. This has pushed away the further left and right but we have enough popular support that we no longer need them.

However the peace and prosperity of our rule has won many of the cynics over and we have formed a genuine trust with our people.

His claim is weaker than some others but his knowledge of the current Russian political landscape is unmatched among most other candidates. By making him Tsar he can use his existing political connections to strengthen the state and secure the Tsarist regime for the foreseeable future."

RUS_Tsar_Pavel_desc:0 "The death of Dimitri has left his son as his natural heir. With his father’s connections fraying with his death it remains to be seen just how well this child will rule, or if he will at all. Already the vultures circle his Regency Council and the danger of Tsar Pavel never ruling in his own right is great. However, the greatest rulers from great adversity so if he overcomes these dangers, who's to say he is not Peter the Great come again."

RUS_Tsarina_Anastasia:0 "Tsarina Anastasia"
RUS_Tsarina_Anastasia_desc:0 "Anastasia Romanov has appeared before us! She has appeared in Moscow claiming to have been whisked away by a compassionate Bolshevik after feigning her death. Her claim has been viewed with suspicion by all, including the government who after a little digging has revealed her to be little better than a common Pole named Anna Anderson. This revelation has left her with no support from almost every sector of the country. The people dismiss her as a common charlatan. The Romanovs denounce her for stealing the identity of a child who was murdered. The government has already begun looking for another claimant. However, unsettling news has been handed down from the Regency Council. Shadowy powerbrokers in the government have pulled their strings and now the Council has decided, against literally everybody’s wishes including their own, to confirm this suspicious imposter as Tsarina. This has caused an uproar across the nation since the people and the government refuse to listen to an obvious fraud who is way out of her depth. In the end though they must fall in line if Russia is to survive the coming trials."

RUS_Tsar_Boris:0 "Tsar Boris I"
RUS_Tsar_Boris_desc:0 "The legitimate claimant Kirill has refused the throne, wishing to stay out of the toxic world of Russian politics. That means the crown will fall to his brother, Boris, who currently resides in the Caucuses but has been in contact with our government for some time and has accepted the throne. While not the preferred legitimate candidate, and his lack of sons worries those with enough farsight, his claim is strong and the government waits for him even now."

RUS_Tsar_Roman:0 "Tsar Roman I"
RUS_Tsar_Roman_desc:0 "Roman Romanov is the Grandson of Nicholas II’s first cousin once removed and Chief of Army Staff Nicholas Nikolaeavich. His claim to the throne is rather tenuous, with its main support being the fact that he is a Romanov. However he is far enough away from the admitted incompetence of Nicholas II’s blood that he would be a blank slate, untainted by any stains of History. As he arrives in Moscow Russia prepares for a new and promising future."

RUS_Tsar_Vsevolod:0 "Tsar Vsevolod I"
RUS_Tsar_Vsevolod_desc:0 "Prince Vsevolod is one of the more unorthodox candidates for rule. A distant cousin and godson of Nicholas II, he has spent most of his life outside Russia. He has ties with the slavs of the Balkans and can act as a pan-Slavist bridge should the need arise. With the other options being crossed off one after another this most radical option is quickly becoming the most sensible one we have left. On the upside his almost complete detachment from Nicholas II does allow him a certain degree of freedom, unburdened by the weight of history."

RUS_Tsar_Andrei:0 "Tsar Andrei I"
RUS_Tsar_Andrei_desc:0 "Andrei Romanov, eldest nephew to Nicholas II, has been chosen to lead Russia. His closeness to Nicholas gives him a large amount of legitimacy while his distance relieves him of the baggage the main line had after centuries of rule. His election is the prefect compromise for the purists who wish the new Tsar to be as closely related to Nicholas as possible and the reformists who want a new branch to rule in the capital. "

RUS_Tsar_Mikhail:0 "Tsar Mikhail II"
RUS_Tsar_Mikhail_desc:0 "The nephew of Nicholas II, Georgy Mikhailovich, has been selected to lead Russia. As the closest relation to Nicholas the selection is only natural.

Now all he must do is arrive in the capital to receive it and lead Russia into its next golden era."

Wrangel proved his love for Russia during the Civil War. Since then he has been a staunch supporter of the nation, not the man who led it. This man, who has given decades of his life in service for Russia, should be the one to lead it."

As such we will keep some limited Republican institutions like the Duma and Senate to help lead the areas of state where the Tsar cannot pay attention to. Not only that but the people have still not entirely shaken off their love of the Republic. To shift back to the natural state of affairs, with the Tsar ruling unchallenged as God intended, would only bring about another Revolution."

Its the highest seat of our most Holy Church, the last embers of Rome grow colder within it by the day.

Kerensky was sympathetic to us, but he plainly used us to shore up his own independent power base. Now with our own leaders at the helm we will forge a new Russia in our own image.

Some call it Socialism, we call it good business."

That is why it's only plain that we ally with our natural friends and push for the restoration of the Tsar, albeit bound by constitutional guardrails. We have tasted the bitter pill of unrestrained rule of a despot before and after the revolution. To go back to the authoritarian days of old would spell disaster and chaos just like that which we pulled ourselves out of. Some of our new friends won't be happy about the restrictions, but when they taste power for the first time in their political careers they will come around."

The monarchists have been strong in previous elections but have slowly stagnated since their peak and have been shrinking in more recent polling. That is why we must accept the reality that the Republic is here to stay. We will lean on ring wing Republicans to shore up our support in the Duma.

While the Party heads declare their independence from their financial backers its clear to anybody who looks that the capitalists who have snatched up large portions of the economy have taken control of the Party. They know they made us, and we know they can unmake us just as easy. Without a doubt they will try to use the government to grow their own wealth past it's already absurd heights.

We will remind the people of its failures, the inherent divisiveness of democracy and the ease which demagogues and tyrants can hijack the state. We will remind them of the stability brough by the Tsars, about the golden ages of the past and promise them the world in the future. Whether we fulfill these promises is a moot point, by the time the Tsar is on the throne the Republicans won't have a chance to fight back. "

They know not what they speak of, but their delusions have given way to violence. Many areas are plagued by misguided ‘independence movements’ who seek only to rape, kill and pillage.

Proposals to revive the organization as a semi-official government arm have been floated since we have come to power. Now that we have a strong footing to work from, these proposals have leapt from the drawing room to the drafting table.

These men have been lacking in robust jobs for most of their peoples existence in the Russian state which has condemned them to an unfortunate poverty.

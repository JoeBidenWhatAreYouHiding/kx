  GFX_SPEVNT_Chinareich_DESC:0 "Shocking the East and the wider world, Germany has done the impossible by securing all of China under their command after initially only commanding the coastal cities that dotted the East China Sea. Beating back the Qing and the Japanese for dominance over the Far East, the Kaisereich has expanded its influence across all of China. From Hami to Peking, Nanjing to Harbin, the entire Middle Kingdom now belongs to the Germans and their Allgemeine Ostasiatische Gesellschaft. Under the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung - or the Board of Directors for the German East Asian General Administration - and the restored Dragon Throne under Emperor Wēilián, all under Heaven and all in China now lies within the palms of the German Emperor. The world hegemon only continues to grow and dominate as yet another empire falls before the might of the German war machine while Kaiser Wilhelm and his nation strive to spread the imperial might of the Kaiserreich to every corner of the globe."

Originating in the Cossack Republic of the Don, the German aligned Republic fell under total control of the local garrison following the death of its long time Ataman. As troops continue to flood into Russia in order to aid in efforts to crush resistance to German rule, the future of Russia seems dire indeed."

Led by Andrey Vlasov, the Committee promises to bring true Republicanism and Liberty to Russia, while also granting huge swaths of autonomy to Russia's vast minority groupings. If they truly are bring Republicanism to Russia or are simply yet another group simply seeking to rule over their own fiefdom remains to be seen."

Their predictions were incorrect, for the nationalist government undertook a vigorous campaign of unifying the people and state military under the auspice of reconcstructing a forgotten Burgundian identity. With the formerly Belgian armies marching through Lothair's old domain the newly proclaimed state has reshaped the balance of power in Western Europe forever."

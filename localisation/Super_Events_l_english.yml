  GFX_SPEVNT_RUSSIAN_UNIFICATION_drozd_DESC:0 "When Lavr Kornilov first seized power from the decaying Russian Republic, few expected his rule to last. Be it the endless internal divisions within his own organization or the constantly scheming behind his back. Indeed, soon after he tried to purge the Drozdovsky Clique, they seized the power. Drozdovsky formalized Kornilov's dream of a statocracic society, though at a cost of wide repressions. Drozdovsky's forces have triumphed over those of the Transamur, finally uniting Russia. With the Far East secure, Russia is once more in a position to assert herself into China, or even against the Japanese Empire..."

Having declared war on the regime of the King and Hetman, the Directory plans to restore the Ukrainian people's lost rights and freedoms. But not only the West of Ukraine, but also the East resists the old regime: workers and peasants revolt in the villages and towns, organizing an insurgent movement.\nWho will win in this civil war remains uncertain."

  GFX_SPEVNT_Chinareich_DESC:0 "Shocking the East and the wider world, Germany has done the impossible by securing all of China under their command after initially only commanding the coastal cities that dotted the East China Sea. Beating back the Qing and the Japanese for dominance over the Far East, the Kaisereich has expanded its influence across all of China. From Hami to Peking, Nanjing to Harbin, the entire Middle Kingdom now belongs to the Germans and their Allgemeine Ostasiatische Gesellschaft. Under the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung - or the Board of Directors for the German East Asian General Administration - and the restored Dragon Throne under Emperor Wēilián, all under Heaven and all in China now lies within the palms of the German Emperor. The world hegemon only continues to grow and dominate as yet another empire falls before the might of the German war machine while Kaiser Wilhelm and his nation strive to spread the imperial might of the Kaiserreich to every corner of the globe."

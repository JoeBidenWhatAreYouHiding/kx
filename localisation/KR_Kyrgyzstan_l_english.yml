The Union spread its influence to Northern Kyrgyzstan and was the most popular revolutionary force, uniting more than 7,000 people. The Union was heavily influenced by the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, but after victory of reactionary forces in Turkestan, \"Bukara\" practically ceased to exist and its leader was killed. However, the party got a second chance under the leadership of Imanaly Aidarbekov, who re-established the union under the name \"Kyrgyz Socialist Party\", in opposition to the Pishpek branch of the Alash Party, his former fellow party members.

### Events ###
kyr.1.t: "Kyrgyz Autonomy"
kyr.1.d: "After the February Revolution, active political and social movements also began in Pishpek and Qaraqol in the Kyrgyz territory. The most significant party at that time was the Qazaq party \"Alash\", which enjoyed significant support among the Kyrgyz. Already in June 1917, the Pishpek district branch of the party was established, with Abdykerim Sydykov at its head. The party sought to unite Turkestan. In the same month in Osh at a meeting of Muslims, a resolution was adopted on the formation of a \"Society of Progressives \"Turan\"\". This organization, which united some high school students, teachers, translators and representatives of the merchant bourgeoisie, supported the position of the \"Alash\" party.\n\nHowever, in Kyrgyzstan, which remained a colonial possession of Russia, the February Revolution did not solve the most important issues - argrarian relations remained the same as under the Tsarist government. The main land wealth was in the hands of local manaps and bais, and Kyrgyz dekhkans suffered from land scarcity or lack thereof. The Revolutionary Democratic Union \"Bukara\" emerged as a response to these challenges, aimed to protect the interests of the dekhkans, and managed to unite a significant part of the Kyrgyz poor.\n\nIn the end, the representatives of national circles won and Pishpek became part of the reconstituted Turkestan Republic, the Alash Party in alliance with Mustafa Shokay's Jadidists was able to retain power at the local level, but the region remained poor and most issues were not resolved."
kyr.1.a: "Alga, Kyrgyzstan!"

kyr.2.t: "Mujahideen Revolts"
kyr.2.d: "Despite our secession and declaration of independence from the Turkestan Republic, which is mired in the chaos of war and corruption, the region is still not calm. In the south, near the city of Osh, there are active battles with the local Uzbek mujahideen militia led by Muhiddin Bey. The situation remains unstable, and the Kyrgyz Socialist Party has taken this opportunity to increase pressure on our government.\n\n\"Bukara\" demands an immediate transition to the Soviet system of governance, and joining forces with the Turkestan party ERK for the sake of the Kyrgyz dekhkans. However, at this stage we cannot afford it. We face a difficult choice, either to concentrate on suppressing the mujahideen insurgency or to deal with the socialist opposition."
kyr.2.a: "There's no time to quarell with the Bukara!"
kyr.2.b: "Socialist are a bigger threat!"

kyr.3.t: "Suppression of the Mujahideen Insurgency"
kyr.3.d: "Thanks to the concentration of forces on fighting the mujahideen, our militia units led by Jurakhon Zaynobiddinov, an Uzbek who is a Bukara supporter in one way or another, were able to suppress the insurgency in the south of the country. In return for the help, the socialists certainly want concessions in their direction, but now that we have only one problem to worry about, we can easily fight them back.\n\nThe power of our party has now been extended to all the territory under our control, and we are ready to embark on reforms that will hopefully improve the lives of all Kyrgyz."
kyr.3.a: "Stability returns to Kyrgyzstan."

kyr.4.t: "Bukara Seizes Power!"
kyr.4.d: "Our inability to cope with the mujahideen uprising has led to disastrous consequences! Outraged by the inaction of the government, the supporters of the Bukara under the leadership of one of the militia commanders, Jurakhon Zaynobiddinov, revolted in Pishpek and arrested our government. In addition, they dissolved it and announced that the Kyrgyz Republic was now a socialist republic and cut all ties with the Alash party.\n\nSoon, reinforced militia units were able to defeat the mujahideen resistance as well, fully restoring control over Kyrgyzstan."
kyr.4.a: "Stability returns to Kyrgyzstan."

kyr.5.t: "Muhiddin Bey's Coup"
kyr.5.d: "Unfortunately, due to our internal strife with Bukara, the Mujahideen were able to occupy a considerable territory in the South, defeating our militia units. With this event, the authority of our government was weakened enough for the Bukara to attempt to seize power by force. However, they were unsuccessful. Sydykov and the government managed to flee abroad to the Alash Orda, but the power vacuum that was vacated was taken over by the hardened Mujahideen.\n\nAfter occupying Pishpek and defeating Bukara, Muhiddin Bey declared the immediate return of the Kyrgyz region to Turkestan and joined the Mujahideen forces in Osh. The Kyrgyz Republic ended before it had even begun."
kyr.5.a: "Game over!"

kyr.6.t: "Mujahideen Coup in Pishpek"
kyr.6.d: "Unfortunately, due to our internal strife with Bukara, the Mujahideen were able to occupy a considerable territory in the South, defeating our militia units. With this event, the authority of our government was weakened enough for the Bukara to attempt to seize power by force. However, they were unsuccessful. Sydykov and the government managed to flee abroad to the Alash Orda, but the power vacuum that was vacated was taken over by the hardened Mujahideen.\n\nAfter occupying Pishpek and defeating Bukara, Muhiddin Bey declared the immediate return of the Kyrgyz region to Turkestan and joined the Mujahideen forces in Osh. The Kyrgyz Republic ended before it had even begun."
kyr.6.a: "At least the separatists are defeated!"

kyr.7.t: "Opium Trade"
kyr.7.d: "Since tsarist times, the territories of Pishpek and Qaraqol districts, as well as neighboring Semirechye, have been actively engaged in poppy and opium production and cross-border trade with China. It was opium that caused the violence during the 1916 uprising, which was outstanding in comparison with the rest of Central Asia. Qazaqs and Kyrgyz have been actively involved in opium smuggling from the very beginning of its appearance in the region, as shepherds grazed their flocks abroad, on Chinese territory, where they could sell drugs for part of the year.\n\nThe tsarist government tried unsuccessfully to establish a state monopoly on the purchase, control, and marketing of opium. By the time the tsarist empire collapsed, opium had become one of region's main assets. The market value of this product was significantly higher than any other produced in the region. During the civil war, the economy was in a state of \"anarchic emission economy\". This, combined with the collapse of production and the severing of trade ties with Russia, led to hyperinflation in Turkestan.\n\nOpium is now the largest asset in our economy, but it is not controlled by the central government. Smuggling and the black market are growing, and this could lead to significant problems in the future."
kyr.7.a: "Evil or blessing?"

kyr.8.t: "Land Issue in Kyrgyz Republic"
kyr.8.d: "In Kyrgyzstan, resolving land and water issues was the main task in overcoming the vestiges of colonialism. After the suppression of the 1916 uprising, most Kyrgyz lands were occupied by migrant peasants and Russian Cossacks. Much fertile land was simply taken away from the Kyrgyz dehkans and given to settlers from the metropolis. After the February Revolution, the colonial-imperialist policy continued.\n\nIn the postwar years, the policy was the same as in the rest of Turkestan. The land, subsoil and surface resources, forests and water resources became state property and the land was transferred to the private ownership of the peasants. Since then, private individuals have not solved the problem of selling land and water by mutual agreement. Such work is carried out by the state, and the right to grant land is determined by law in accordance with local conditions. For the Kyrgyz lands, where part of the territory remained under the control of the Ferghana army of the monster, the dehkans received practically nothing.\n\nNow the government is proposing a new reform: the socialization of agricultural equipment of wealthy migrant peasants and rich Russian Cossacks and the creation of a land fund for transfer to Kyrgyz families."
kyr.8.a: "Land belongs to Kyrgyz people!"

kyr.9.t: "Return of Kyrgyz Exiles and Uyghur Refugees"
kyr.9.d: "Thousands of Kyrgyz exiles, displaced during the Ürkün tragedy, begin their journey back to Kyrgyzstan. They arrive with high hopes of reclaiming their ancestral lands and contributing to the reconstruction and development of their communities. However, the mass return overwhelms local authorities and resources, leading to logistical challenges and overcrowded infrastructure, as well as Black Market dangers.\n\nSimultaneously, instability in neighboring Xinjiang province exacerbates the situation as waves of Uyghur refugees flee persecution and violence, seeking safety across the Kyrgyz border."
kyr.9.a: "We must help the people."

kyr.10.t: "Ürkün Consequences"
kyr.10.d: "In response to the Ürkün (Exodus) tragedy and the return of exiled individuals and refugees, the Kyrgyz government seeks to address the displacement and dispossession experienced by affected individuals. Not only government is openly calling for the exiled ones to return and receive citizenship, they also establish a specialized Restitution Commission in order to facilitate the return of land and property to eligible claimants."
kyr.10.a: "Land belongs to Kyrgyz people!"

kyr.11.t: "The Flow of Refugees is Increasing"
kyr.11.d: "The civil war in East Turkestan caused shockwaves throughout the region and the turmoil in Kashgar triggered a mass exodus of refugees. Reports from the border towns indicate that families, whose lives have been upended by violence and uncertainty, are crossing into Turkestan seeking refuge. The dusty roads leading from Kashgar and Dihua to Qaraqol are now crowded with people of all ages, clutching what little belongings they can carry."
kyr.11.a: "Disastrous!"

kyr.12.t: "Opium Trade Amidst Refugee Crisis"
kyr.12.d: "With the influx of refugees, particularly those of Uyghur origin, fleeing instability in Xinjiang, the traditional routes and networks used for opium smuggling may experience disruptions. However, some refugees, facing economic hardship and limited opportunities, may turn to participation in smuggling activities as a means of survival, inadvertently fueling the trade. The presence of refugees in border regions could also complicate law enforcement efforts to crack down on opium production and trafficking."
kyr.12.a: "Well well well..."

kyr.13.t: "Dissolution of the Alash Party!"
kyr.13.d: "Today, we have received the news from [ALO.Capital.GetName] that the glorious days of the Alash party were over. Unable to find a compromise, two main factions have announced that they prefer to split and create their own organizations. The radical wing of the party, led by Mirjaqyp Dulatuly has announced its own party - Janar, while the moderate wing announced the creation of the Republican Party. Our own department was much closer to the Alash moderates, but the policies of the radicals are more aligned with our own goals."
kyr.13.a: "We will proudly become the members of Janar."
kyr.13.b: "With the Republicans, now and forever."

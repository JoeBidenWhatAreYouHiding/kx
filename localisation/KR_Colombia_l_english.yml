When the Colombian Congress denied to ratify the treaty the United States forced the secession of Panamá from Colombia, compensating them between 1921 and 1930 with a payment of a total 25 million Dollars. Colombia formally recognised Panamá in 1921. The conservatives pursued the modernisation of the country, expanding the railroad network. Since 1850 Colombia had been exporting tobacco, after 1900 coffee and bananas were added (with the aid of U.S. capital), after 1905 petroleum. The liberals formed a government in 1930 which enacted a land reform, dispossessing big landowners, and social reforms, with economic benefits for the middle class, the workers' class and the peasants."

When Arango addressed them and asked for their opinions they responded curtly, exchanged glances then returned to their previous routine of smoking and disinterest. The rest of the meeting went smoothly but at the end Villegas called Camancho aside and told him what was going on. Moreno and Hermida had attended a recent lecture given by the philosopher Fernando Gonzales Ochoa, a man known in conservative and reactionary circles, mainly for his views on Latin racial purity, panism, and for his love for Nietzsche and his theories. While to the average observer these views may seem not too different from our own, there are still key differences that make Ochoa more esoteric and whacky than most of our base. If we let Moreno and Hermida go they could rally more of the right to our cause which could bolster our support base or alienate the moderates and split the party. We must respond before things get out of hand."

After the denunciations ended Moreno and Hermida exploded into a rage. They launched into a sudden and lengthy rant denouncing our ideals and views. They said the political landscape of Colombia has changed severely since the publication of our Nationalist Manifesto and events have outrun us. They then outlined their own view of a nationalist Colombia, united in spirit and purpose to uplift the Latin American man to his greatest form based on the ideas of Ochoa. The dual speeches lasted a total of seven hours. At its end the ministers sat for a moment, frozen in shock and not a little bit of terror at the sheer anger and rage displayed by the two men. After a moment of silence the room erupted into a chorus of boos and cheers as each man picked their side. Satisfied by their actions, the two men then left the room without another word or so much as glancing at Carreno or Arango. Not long after Villegas, convinced by their passionate speeches, followed them out.

This is done in flagrant violation to the fact that by law, a law which was crafted in part by Moreno and Hermida themselves, political parties in Colombia are banned. The party clearly aims to stir up popular anger at the government and serve as a lightning rod for the former politicians displaced by the Leopardos’s iron fisted rule. While the party is still in its infancy there is a lot to suggest they will quickly become the greatest threat the Leopardos have yet faced. While Ochoa, Moreno and Hermida are rather small political figures, their message that our political program is behind the times resonates with much of the populace and even among our own Council who are now demanding we modernize our Party, starting with a new leader. Some have proposed Gilberto Alzate Avedano, one of the most reactionary Conservatives in government, to lead us to the future. Others worry Gilberto’s greed and extremism would only alienate moderates in the party and tug at the seams of our state. Despite their reservations, for better and for worse, we must make a decision."

Some loyalist elements in the population and military held out for a few hours but after a few short battles they too bowed to the inevitable.

col.29.d:0 "As the 1938 election approaches, many are wondering if perhaps a new face for the Leopardos should be chosen. While Eliseo Arango is not unknown, they lack key support in other areas such as with the armed forces, support that other figures within the coming elections carry. To solve this, many have proposed that general Carlos Cortés Vargas be nominated to be the public face for Los Leopardos. The general participated in the infamous 'Massacre de Las Bananeras' in 1928 where a lot of striking syndicalist dogs were put down. Because of that and its repercussions he lost his job and fell to disgrace. Many feel that the general would be a perfect fit for the party. After all, his so-called massacre was nothing compared to the damages done by syndicalists revolutions that have occurred else where in the world. By having him be the public face, we would be signaling to the Reds just what their fate will be. Vargas himself has been quite vocal in his support of the Leopardos, and would no doubt gladly take us up on the offer.

colpuppet.1.d:0 "After the conquest of Colombia and the fall of the previous regime, it was decided by our administration to install a loyal government in charge of internal and political affairs, where we will decide on everything related to foreign policy and diplomacy. For this purpose, we summoned the politicians willing to work with us to sign the document that would install the allied government of Colombia, this treaty was written by our Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs who seems to have mistakenly written the official name of the new country as 'Columbia' instead of 'Colombia'.\n\nThe Colombians who signed the treaty did not realize the error until a few hours after the treaty was actually in place. Already politicians and revolutionaries who are against what they called 'the government at the boot of the imperialists' used our mistake as a proof of our lack of interest for the Colombian people, our government and the secretary of state justified this 'choice' of name as being 'easier to pronounce for the American people and in other languages such as Russian'. Obviously our explanation did not please the Colombians who are now inhabitants of Columbia..."
colpuppet.1.a:0 "Hail Columbia?"
colpuppet.1.b:0 "Revert changes! This is so embarassing..."

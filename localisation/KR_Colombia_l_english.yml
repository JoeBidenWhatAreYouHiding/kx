### Ideas ###
COL_factionalized_army:0 "Factionalized Army"
COL_factionalized_army_desc:0 "Since the war with Peru, Colombia’s armed forces have become strongly divided politically. While the a few top generals are orbiting around Field Marshal Pinilla, others feel like the Caudillo should didn't diserve his post, that previously was occupied by much more respected war heroes, and they instead support the ex-conservative Gomez Castro and his christian message, meanwhile many of the privates and lower ranking officers are in favour of a more hands-off approach or even openly oppose their superiors. As a whole, the military apparatus is unconvinced about the competence and leadership of Pinilla. He has much to prove, and many consider the Marshal incapable of leading a stabilized Colombia. This attitude is reflected in the general state of our army, which is greatly disorganized and unprepared for battle."
COL_licenses_from_GER:0 "Ties with Germany"
COL_licenses_from_GER_desc:0 "Field Marshal Pinilla has successfully petitioned for the support of the German Empire. After a successful meeting with the Kaiser's diplomats, new economic and military agreements have been set in stone between our two nations, and German companies and weapon licenses have begun to be contracted within our nation's factories. With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."
COL_tradecongress:0 "Congreso de Sindicatos Colombianos"
COL_tradecongress_desc:0 "A congress of the nation’s trade unions has been established and called the \"Congress of Colombian Syndicates\". The governing body was inspired by European syndicalist countries like the Commune of France and the Union of Britain. While the European model of Syndicalism may not fit our economic capabilities, it seems to be successful so far. Our people are enjoying the fruits of a new political freedom, and this morale boost is helping us establish our new economic system and is slightly boosting our industrial output."
COL_armedminorities:0 "Armed Minorities"
COL_armedminorities_desc:0 "All Colombian peoples have a right to preserve their own dignity. Indigenous people and Afro-Colombians, among other minorities, often had to struggle to survive under the yoke of capitalism. Many times their livelihoods were destroyed in the name of \"profit\". Now the time has come to let their voices be heard and help us build a new society based on equality and participation by having the various formerly oppressed minority groups join our armed forces in order to help us defend their rights. We are not a nation of one people, and this fact makes us stronger."
COL_socialisteconomy:0 "The New Economy"
COL_socialisteconomy_desc:0 "As part of our new benevolent rule, a new economic system is put in place, as it has already been done in other parts of the world. The end goal is for the means of production to be held by the workers, but at the moment the effort is concentrated primarily on securing economic independence from foreign capital, which has proven difficult because of the capitalistic pigs in our vicinities. This radical shift will prove to be difficult to implement, but Colombia has previously shown that it is ready to deal with difficult situations such as this. It is only a matter of time before the growing pains subside."
COL_industrialist_protest:0 "Industrialists Protest"
COL_industrialist_protest_desc:0 "Remnants of the Old Colombia still resist our rightful rule. The industrialists are protesting the implementation of new measures proposed by the Revolutionary Congress to empower labor unions and redistribute wealth. This is having terrible effects on our economy, as factories are closing en masse in a misguided attempt to stop the socialist forces or at least to force concessions from them. We must act before the masses of unemployed turn on us in an unjust rage."
COL_industrialist_protest_crushed:0 "Industrialists Protest Crushed"
COL_industrialist_protest_crushed_desc:0 "The worst has come to an end. The industrialists protested the implementation of new measures proposed by the Revolutionary Congress to empower labor unions and redistribute wealth, closing factories and shops en masse in attempt to stop the socialist forces or at least to force concessions from them. The governament has responded rapidly and with force, dispersing the crowd and forcing the strikers to reopen their workplaces, one way of another."
COL_helping_the_darien:0 "Helping the Darien"
COL_helping_the_darien_desc:0 "The Darien, once Department of Chocó, was one if not the first spanish settlement in Colombia. Since then, because of the large abundance of inhospitable forest and swamps, the region developed much less and at a slower pace than the rest of the country. We have granted The Darien provisory independence under collaborationist Leopardos government and promised them help to their economy in order to catch up with us."
COL_exiling_enemies:0 "Casting Out The Enemy"
COL_exiling_enemies_desc:0 "Colombia cannot become a world power if the socialists and their allies keep getting in the way. Thankfully, Arango Ramos has come up with a plan to exile our opposition without causing an international scandal by setting up a puppet state in Chocó administered by him..."
COL_exiling_enemies_heavy:0 "Mass Exiling"
COL_exiling_enemies_heavy_desc:0 "Colombia cannot become a world power if the socialists and their allies keep getting in the way. Thankfully Arango Ramos has come up with a plan to exile our opposition immediately by setting up a puppet state in Chocó to keep the most troublesome citizens under careful watch. He'll figure out what to do with them..."
COL_political_turmoil:0 "Political Turmoil"
COL_political_turmoil_desc:0 "In a country where the two party system has always been the norm, the recent birth of minor parties led by ex-members of the Liberal and Conservative parties has moved the country’s political discourse to the extremes. Frequent episodes of violence have emerged in all of Colombia, especially in the zones furthest from the capital, where the state's grip is weakest. Many political analysts predict that at this rate we will have serious trouble to deal with in the next few years, and politically-motivated violence may become the norm."
COL_black:0 "Black Monday"
COL_black_desc:0 "Black Monday had a very harsh effect on Colombia's economy, with a large part of the population suddenly becoming jobless and losing their livelihood as companies folded almost overnight. Massive changes will be necessary to stop this economic disaster and put the country back on its feet!"
COL_black_2:0 "Recovering from Black Monday"
COL_black_2_desc:0 "The first signs of a recovery are starting to appear as Colombia's economy seems to be turning a corner, but there is still much more work to be done if we wish to boast that we have beaten this crisis."
COL_black_over:0 "¡Adios Black Monday!"
COL_black_over_desc:0 "Finally the era of Black Monday has become a thing of the past. No one will miss these hard times and Colombia is celebrating her victory against the grim fate that at first seemed inevitable. Business seems to be returning to pre-crisis levels, and people are celebrating and chanting in the streets: 'Adios Black Monday, may you never come back'."
COL_bogotazo:0 "¡Bogotazo!"
COL_bogotazo_desc:0 "As many analysts previously correctly predicted, a spark was all it took to ignite serious riots and the nation has delved into chaos. Now, armed political groups are openly fighting in the streets and setting fire to buildings and vehicles."
COL_bogotazo_2:0 "¡La Violencia!"
COL_bogotazo_2_desc:0 "In the awful climate of violence and destruction perpetrated by both sides of the political spectrum, the president decided to take sides and in doing so has only made the problem worse. Even if not yet declared, Colombia is now on the verge of a civil war."
COL_new_constructions:0 "Building Up the Public Transport Network"
COL_new_constructions_desc:0 "Fulfilling promises to develop the capital's public infrastructure, a new public transport system is being built in Bogotá. As a result of the massive public works project being undertaken, a large portion of government funding and resources that could’ve been used elsewhere are being diverted to bring reliable public transport to the people of Bogotá."
COL_religious_schools:0 "Religious Schools"
COL_religious_schools_desc:0 "Childrens in public schools are taught extensively about the ways of Christ and his message, but much less about history, algebra and other relevant skills for more technical careers. The next generation's preparation for the modern job market is suffering because of this and the nation now lacks good engineers and scientists, but on the bright side we've no shortage of priests."
COL_reform_mil_academies:0 "Reformed Military Academies"
COL_reform_mil_academies_desc:0 "As Field Marshal Pinilla and other high ranking army leaders demanded, the reformation of military academies is intended to assure the loyalty of the cadets and eliminate any risk of having soldiers secretly siding with the socialists and other insurgent elements. This of course will increase the amount of time needed to train new recruits as we ensure their loyalty to the cause, but won’t really provide much in terms of extra combat readiness for our troops."
COL_airdisaster:0 "President in Hospital"
COL_airdisaster_desc:0 "The President had an accident during an Air Show in Bogotá and he is now being kept under close observation in a hospital. A Temporary Council lead by one appointee chosen by the Congress has been formed to substitute him since the vice-presidency has been abolished by the 1910 constitutional reforms. Although the Council is trying their best to keep the public morale up and the cities safe in this difficult moment, many are seizing the opportunity to protest the legitimacy of the government and its recent policies."

col.1.d:0 "Weakened by numerous civil wars (especially from 1899 - 1903), the Colombian government was forced to acknowledge US control of the Panama Canal in the Hay–Herrán Treaty of 1903.\nDespite that, the ruling conservative government successfully pursued a policy of modernization, expanding industrial and naval infrastructure. During this time, Colombia began to export great quantities of coffee, bananas and emeralds with the aid of US and Canadian capital. However, conflicts between the two major parties and their supporters never faded, and with the growing number of strikes and unrest, tensions flared in 1928 as the conservative government approved of the massacre of a group of banana workers near Santa Marta on the orders of the United Fruit Company. Estimates of the number of deaths ranged from 47 to as high as 2000. Public outcry ensued and a then-fringe faction lead by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán managed to swing the congress into adopting extensive measures to limit the power of the armed forces and punishing those responsible for the "Bananeras Massacre".\nHaving lost support in the congress the conservatives ceded power to the liberals who formed a government in 1930 which enacted various social and economic reforms with benefits for various social strata. Then..."

International support soon backed each side and the Colombian Conservative Party staunchly opposed the government's diplomatic effort. A military junta was quickly formed to lead the country.\nThe war lasted one and a half years as both the Colombian and Peruvian forces fought for the Amazon, but after a miscalculated intervention by Ecuador who were given a provocatory ultimatum by Peru, the new frontline became centered in Guayaquil and the surrounding areas.\nBecause of the disastrous state of the Colombian army due to the reaction to the "Bananeras Massacre", Peru was able to swiftly conquer the rest of Ecuadorian territories and could push directly into the Colombian heartland.\nThe following treaty was humiliating as Colombia lost a large portion of its southern lands. Once again, the army fell out of favor and previous president Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo was restored back to his legitimate position with popular support, working once more to heal Colombia's wounds..."

A Canadian businessman approached our economic minister Jorge Soto Del Corral with the intention of setting up a new massive emerald industry there in order to work and cut emerald extracted in the nearby Boyacá department. Unfortunately, the only remaining emerald deposit not already conceded to private enterprises is almost entirely located right under a spot sacred to the indigenous people living there. As soon as they heard of the deal, the natives contacted the famous native leader Quintin Lame, who in 1914 made a name for himself by commanding a rebellion in the name of the indigenous people of Medellín, who aimed to form a "Free Indigenous Nation". This is a matter we must handle with the utmost delicacy, but in the end, many in our cabinet say that this is an opportunity we cannot miss."

Many on both sides have launched attacks on the publications supporting the opposing side, setting buildings on fire and brutally killing others in their homes. This new wave of violence is currently confined to the coastal cities, but soon it could spread to our capital and other major urban centers in the interior. Meanwhile, although the army has been deployed to maintain order, certain elements within the army are also fanning the flames of hate against UNIR voters. People's militias are starting to organize in the countryside and in the Chocó department, where the government’s control is weakest, proclaiming their need for self-defence. Some of them are even calling for a nationwide revolution, which could result in a large-scale civil war.\nThe situation is getting increasingly desperate with every hour that passes.

Approximately 100000 people, including supporters of the militias and more moderate liberals, are participating alongside the organizers, utilizing absolute silence from all of the demonstrators to denounce the recent episodes of violence that have shaken the country. Gaitán has used the march to call for an end to the government’s use of the police and military forces to repress political opposition, and invites us to confront the UNIR in a more civil and constitutional manner. Although today’s protest has thus far proceeded without incident, another protest is already scheduled for next Sunday in Manizales, with another in Bucaramanga in the works.\nDespite the current peaceful veneer Gaitán is trying to lend the protests, officials in the army are worried that the militias might eventually take them over, and that the country's security might continue to slip if left unchecked. The army is now requesting authorization to utilize force to disperse the protestors if they don’t comply with orders."

Pinilla, at first designated by the plotters to become the new president, is evidently still distrusted by some of those who have seen him rise to the highest rank despite the post-war purges. After a few small confrontations between the army and the ever growing people’s militias in Barranquilla, the golpe de estado in Bogota was ready to go. The defectors had already begun positioning themselves, raising alarms among the public of what was happening, then, suddenly, the streets went silent once again. Sources told us Pinilla is blaming Field Marshal París Gordillo for the failure, since the two of them clashed more than once. The militias are calling for immediate action to be taken against the military leaders in order to prevent another coup attempt from causing further chaos, but more moderate factions are calling for a dialogue to be opened with ex-conservative Laureano Gomez, which would, according to some, convince the military extremists to avoid possible bloodshed."

They also demand a further expansion of our welfare policies starting with the creation of new public transportation systems in the capital. The letter concluded with the signature: \"Sincerely, THE PEOPLE OF COLOMBIA\". A separate meeting to hear the demands of the other minor forces of their coalition, the Totalists and the Syndicalists, has been scheduled for next week.\n\nIn Antioquia, in the midst of the back and forth this morning, coffee plantation workers began to strike. Because of the recent events, some locals are worried about the threat of a collaboration between armed Chulavita activists and policemen willing to operate outside normal measures and take the law into their own hands, which would likely result in a massacre similar to the one which occurred in 1928 with the bananeras.

They demanded for the newspaper to print a list of their proposed solutions to our country's problems for the whole of Colombia and even the world to see, unless the government responds to their ultimatum. The text opens with an accusation of ineptitude by our government, due to our inability to settle the situation still ongoing in Antioquia, which they say would \"easily be resolved\" by simply accepting the demands of strikers and by answering their plea for improved working conditions. What follows is a long list of claims and grievances separated by demands coming from each faction. Chief among the claims are the Totalist's request to arm the party for self defense and the Syndicalist's request to instruct our foreign affairs with the goal of forming a closer bond with the Commune of France and all other member of the Internationale Congress.

Diego Luis Córdoba had already stated his intention to form closer ties with members of the Internationale and with all revolutionary countries, including ours, as a first step to an official alliance to be carried out once the unions of Colombia are strong enough to \"expel all capitalist pigs\" and \"bring peace to the working class people\".\n\nThe proposal concluded stating that this could be the start of a long and fruitful friendship between our great nations."

People started gathering as Pinilla began to read his ultimatum to our government. He then invited the Leopardos' head ideologue Elíseo Arango Ramos to come forward and publicly shake hands with him. Later, we received a written and signed copy of their ultimatum. It details the demands for the establishment of a special military Emergency Force designated exclusively to deal with the socialist threat, the reformation of military academies in order to assure discipline and moral rigor within their ranks and the nomination of Carlos Cortes Vargas as security minister.\nThis last point is maybe the most concerning one, since Vargas became infamous for his leading role in the Bananeras Massacre. His return to politics would certainly be seen as a provocation by the strikers of Antioquia.

So far, total number of casualties alludes us as the authorities are still investigating the area and excavating the rubble for more bodies. However, news of this travesty has already spread like wildfire, and it has thrown many people in the cities into almost mass hysteria out of fear of yet another attack. This event has definitely stirred our political scene to a breaking point, with many officials somehow pointing blame at us, having so poorly managed the situation that it had escalated to this. Furthermore, the police have yet to arrest any suspects involved. Therefore, it seems that the perpetrators of this heinous crime will get away unscathed. Many members of our party are now calling for emergency elections, which may work in our favour if we announce it on the 20th of July - our Independence Day - in order to reassure that it won't be another fad.

Obviously, this statement has garnered much praise from both like-minded sympathizers and the afrocolombians themselves, and many have seen their confidence increase as a response to the afrocolombians now becoming even more active in the politics of the country.

Some army leaders, including Field Marshal Pinilla, also offered their congratulations to presidential candidate Laureano Gomez, promising their full support. At the end of the day, Gomez is considered a very determined defender of the Catholic faith but is also known to be rather pragmatic in his approach.

He then attacked his main rival candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, calling his last week speech in defence of the afrocolombian people \"just empty rethoric coming from a man who never actually did anything first hand to help minorities\".

He also demanded stronger efforts in dealing with syndicalism, stating that for all the hatred he had for the corporations destroying his territory, and his personal history of friendship with union leaders in the past, he sees the new current wave of socialist interest in natives, expecially from Gaitán, as only an excuse to hold power and not a way to deal with the harsh living conditions of the largely unrepresented people of Colombia.

This morning, Gaitán came into the presidential office and along with other party leaders we started discussing the details of the proposed political merger. He proclaimed that many within the Liberal Party would be vehemently in favor of his comeback and that both parties' political programs were compatible and that united, the parties stood a better chance of winning the upcoming election than if they were to remain separate. With the president’s second mandate reaching its natural end without the constitutional possibility of a third term and with no obvious popular candidate to replace Alfonso López Pumarejo, working with our former competitor now seems the most logical path to have a popular figurehead operating within the party’s umbrella to ensure victory for the party. Gaitán established a large cult of personality around himself, and the naming of him as our candidate would lead to winning back those among his supporters who supported the man more so than any of his political beliefs."

The other socialist parties within the UNIR Bloc have already confirmed their attendance, including the PSC and UTC. The primary topic that many predict will dominate the Congress is said to be the issue of implementing socialist reforms to the country, and how it should be brought about. Concerns regarding our position as a nation in not only South America, but possibly the world, have also begun to spring up and it will indeed be a matter of great importance later down the line.\n\nIt is clear now that this Congress will be quite the hotspot of debate and ideological conflicts, therefore it is imperative that we ensure Colombia does not divide itself even more than it already has."

After some time, there was a general consensus on one aspect: to implement socialist reforms immediately is out of the question. The majority of attendees agreed that we must instead focus on securing our economy and stabilise it, especially after the aftermath that Black Monday had across the country. Furthermore, it was agreed that we should gently begin to implement state policies and investments as a starting effort to combat the economic inequality that is rife in Colombia. The unanimous agreements began to end there, as there were different ideas on which exact sector of the economy should be given attention to first - UNIR and the PSC both agree that investing into developing resources is the right choice, however while the UNIR suggested further excavation in our more untapped regions, the PSC support the research of synthetic refineries as an attempt to boost our industrial management of our natural resources. On the other hand, the Totalists call for boosting military spending and to keep our weapon factories up to date, seeing as our guns are essentially obsolete."

It seems that their irrational fear of socialist policies is so strong that they are willing to plung the nation into further chaos just to politically starve and root us out, and this is evident by the fact that many factories and farms are shutting down in protest. We have had the Syndicalists and the UTC demand that we put an immediate end to this uproar by deploying militias and the army to restablish order and disperse the crowds gathering in the capital. However, our most trusted advisors within the party have reccomended a more soft-handed approach, and that we must placate the demands of the protestors."

[COL.GetColombianTotLeaderLastName] took the floor first and addressed the need to focus on the wider Totalist cause, ensuring that we are both ready to undo the previous trade agreements that have decimated our local economy and be ready to act aggressively, first if needed, against the capitalist threat in order to preserve our nation by any means necessary and, in doing so, setting a example of resilience for other Socialist nations to follow. The PSC, in contrast, have thrown their support in with the Third Internationale, citing them as the \"biggest safety net against the imperialist rats\", despite the fact they agree with the sentiment that the Commune of France has done little to support their South American brothers. Lastly, our proposed solution entails a plan to bring our fellow socialist allies within our continent together in a new faction, maintaining good relations with the Internationale but allowing us to focus our efforts more closely at home in Latin America without having to intervene with the Europeans and their affairs."

As Gordillo arrived, he waited yet his host would never arrive.\n\nThe silence was broken as the screech of a bullet pierced the air - chaos erupted as the militiamen stormed into the house. Startled from the sudden uproar, it seemed that Gordillo had attempted to fire at one of the militiamen but was shot dead before he could pull the trigger. Further investigation found that the first shot was towards a figure that one of the men saw bolting from the back door, away into the wilderness. We can only conclude that it was Pinilla himself who managed to flee. That, and the fact that a sapphire-blue medal was discovered by the edges of the woods, cracked and chipped in its centre; it was the \"Orden de Boyacá\", Pinilla's most prized possession.\n\nHe will most certainly never show his face around ever again, and as far as the rest of the nation is concerned, there was never a man by the name of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, or Gabriel París Gordillo."

col.38.d_2:0 "It seems that we had overestimated our own ability to deal with the dissenters as we have received reports that a group of socialist militias have successfully managed to launch an open rebellion in the Meta and Caqueta departments this morning, with their estimated numbers turning out to be far more than \"a few dozen\". While we managed to crack down resistance in the cities, a few socialist senators managed to flee to join the rebels, and so they have begun to quickly organise in order to nominate a new leader.

col.45.t:0 "Healthcare Reform"
col.45.d:0 "One of the key parts of implementing socialist our reforms into Colombia is the healthcare sector. Arguably a sector that we are well off in compared to further south, we still have the problems of not being able to reach the rural parts of our nation or even supply everyone in the cities with the small but expensive clinics. We have to come forward with reform plans that involve creating hospital standards for our cities and banding doctors in the rural countryside together in a form that would create a net of outreach that offers healthcare to the entire nation. Not only would it benefit our people, it might just place us on top of the other South American nations in terms of healthcare and wellbeing."
col.45.a:0 "A chance for a spotlight of our own"
col.900.t:0 "Coup Avoided!" 
col.900.d:0 "Seemingly against the odds, we have managed to prevent the military coup lead by those reactionary dogs wearing medals. Our government luckily took heed of the rumors of an uprising; thankfully, most of the said rumors were exaggerated by those who don’t care about the workers of this great nation. The small force tasked with the siege of Bogotá has failed miserably and they are now the laughing stock of the entire world. We knew of their coup almost instantly, and we took decisive action. It all pays out in the end. Those in the military who were still loyal to the previous rulers were unable to muster enough support for their cause and have subsequently been dealt with. While this is a major victory for the Colombian workers, as we have managed to keep control and prevented a coup, it is unlikely that the reactionaries will stop at this attempt to topple us, unless we keep obstaculting them and their evil plans. While we have obscured this uprising from the public eye, we must remain ever vigilant."
col.900.a:0 "We need to end this terror once an for all."
col.905.t:0 "Nationalist Resistance"
col.905.d:0 "The results have arrived, and we, the defenders of the working man, have won! Settling down into the government offices we earned, we look at the millions of ballots the traditional parties of the conservatives and liberals lost to us. Celebrating we managed to achieve the popular victory, it quickly sobered up when the second most voted party and our direct rivals in the Nationalist Bloc immediately claimed the election results and our party illegitimate. Now with the possibility the election results could be opposed with force, our government is frantically trying to ensure the reactionary coalition and the counter-revolutionaries in the army don’t gain the sentiment and traction towards any power moves that threaten our first day in office. Meanwhile we move forward for the benefit of the common man, the farmer and the indio; the people who awarded us with their trust and their vote, we cannot let them down."
col.905.a:0 "A reaction was almost inevitable."
col.901.t:0 "Controlling the System"
col.901.d:0 "It appears that we are in a troublesome lack of competent bureaucrats to place in the system as we are trying to fill out the government with those loyal to our regime. The party majority are still untrusting of the army and wish to place political commissars in their ranks to ensure loyalty, while some others are suggesting we should focus our efforts on the civil apparatus to ensure that local provinces and the common worker’s needs are fulfilled. Both are measures to ensure security, but the question is whether we should focus on the army or a local level of loyalty."
col.901.a:0 "Ensuring the army's loyalty is a priority."
col.901.b:0 "We should focus on the civil apparatus first."
col.902.t:0 "Decent Living Conditions for Everyone"
col.902.d:0 "Our government is adamant to defeat homelessness as well as the shanty's that rural villages have become accustomed to. Now of course the first obvious thought is to begin a large-scale effort to build more houses, making large sprawls of housing outside our cities for people to live in. But once we take a look at the possible cost of this, it makes it a more difficult decision. Our alternative would be to repurpose buildings that are not used and fix those that our citizens currently live in, much more cost effective however experts show it would be a temporary plug in the widening gap, meaning that we might be risking our reputation by passing the problem onto the next generation of government. We must choose how to help out our people the best we can."
col.902.a:0 "More houses! More houses! More houses!"
col.902.b:0 "It is more efficient to repurpose buildings."
col.903.t:0 "A Century Old Problem"
col.903.d:0 "Our government has made itself clear on it's campaign towards solving a century long problem that has plagued our nation. The problem being that of federalization, and how much power the states and the government should have. Some have proposed having large-scale autonomy for our newly created states, with them being able to rule their own state’s labor and even security and business efforts. However there are those who think that while the state's deserve autonomy, the central government should control some central laws and of course the nation’s wider path in the world. Whatever path we take, will likely anger the reactionary and conservative elements that have opposed us."
col.903.a:0 "Total federalization."
col.903.b:0 "A lighter one, por favor."
col.906.t:0 "Landed In The Commune Of France"
col.906.d:0 "The Yacht of our delegation proudly displayed the Colombian flag as it maneuvered into the port of Bordeaux. Our diplomats stepped off onto the land after the long trip of the journey, being welcomed by French diplomats and journalists alike. After well photographed images of the two parties greeting and shaking hands, they drove to Paris soon after where they were welcomed by a warm reception from the French populace and even socialist aligned Spaniards who were currently in France. After talks and celebrations with the members of the French and other Internationale representatives, we have thoroughly strengthened our bonds together and showed ourselves to the world to be friends of fellow socialists."
col.906.a:0 "Paris is very pretty indeed."
col.907.t:0 "Landed In The Union Of Britain"
col.907.d:0 "The Yacht of our delegation proudly displayed the Colombian flag as it entered Dover. Stepping off the vessel and greeting the British diplomats and journalists who were sent to receive us, we made sure that our greetings were well documented to be displayed in the world’s news. With that done our delegation went onto Paris where they met major members of the Union’s government, ensuring that Britain and Colombia would now be considered friendly nations as they discussed the wider Internationale, and our possible role in the world's socialist affairs."

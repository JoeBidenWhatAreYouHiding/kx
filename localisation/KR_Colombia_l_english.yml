### Ideas ###
COL_factionalized_army: "Factionalized Army"
COL_factionalized_army_desc: "Since the war with Peru, Colombia's armed forces have become strongly divided politically. While the a few top generals are orbiting around Field Marshal Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, others feel like the Caudillo should didn't diserve his post, that previously was occupied by much more respected war heroes, and they instead support the ex-conservative Gomez Castro and his christian message, meanwhile many of the privates and lower ranking officers are in favour of a more hands-off approach or even openly oppose their superiors. As a whole, the military apparatus is unconvinced about the competence and leadership of Rojas Pinilla. He has much to prove, and many consider the Marshal incapable of leading a stabilized Colombia. This attitude is reflected in the general state of our army, which is greatly disorganized and unprepared for battle."
COL_licenses_from_GER: "Ties with Germany"
COL_licenses_from_GER_desc: "Field Marshal Gustavo Rojas Pinilla has successfully petitioned for the support of the German Empire. After a successful meeting with the Kaiser's diplomats, new economic and military agreements have been set in stone between our two nations, and German companies and weapon licenses have begun to be contracted within our nation's factories. With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."
COL_licenses_from_GER_weapons: "Ties with Germany"
COL_licenses_from_GER_weapons_desc: "Field Marshal Gustavo Rojas Pinilla has successfully petitioned for the support of the German Empire. After a successful meeting with the Kaiser's diplomats, new economic and military agreements have been set in stone between our two nations, and German companies and weapon licenses have begun to be contracted within our nation's factories. With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."
COL_licenses_from_GER_motors: "Ties with Germany"
COL_licenses_from_GER_motors_desc: "Field Marshal Gustavo Rojas Pinilla has successfully petitioned for the support of the German Empire. After a successful meeting with the Kaiser's diplomats, new economic and military agreements have been set in stone between our two nations, and German companies and weapon licenses have begun to be contracted within our nation's factories. With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."
COL_licenses_from_GER_both: "Ties with Germany"
COL_licenses_from_GER_both_desc: "Field Marshal Gustavo Rojas Pinilla has successfully petitioned for the support of the German Empire. After a successful meeting with the Kaiser's diplomats, new economic and military agreements have been set in stone between our two nations, and German companies and weapon licenses have begun to be contracted within our nation's factories. With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."
COL_tradecongress: "Congreso de Sindicatos Colombianos"
COL_tradecongress_desc: "A congress of the nation's trade unions has been established and called the 'Congress of Colombian Syndicates'. The governing body was inspired by European syndicalist countries like the Commune of France and the Union of Britain. While the European model of Syndicalism may not fit our economic capabilities, it seems to be successful so far. Our people are enjoying the fruits of a new political freedom, and this morale boost is helping us establish our new economic system and is slightly boosting our industrial output."
COL_armedminorities: "Armed Minorities"
COL_armedminorities_desc: "All Colombian peoples have a right to preserve their own dignity. Indigenous people and Afro-Colombians, among other minorities, often had to struggle to survive under the yoke of capitalism. Many times their livelihoods were destroyed in the name of 'profit'. Now the time has come to let their voices be heard and help us build a new society based on equality and participation by having the various formerly oppressed minority groups join our armed forces in order to help us defend their rights. We are not a nation of one people, and this fact makes us stronger."

COL_antisocialist_trade_idea: "Anti-Socialist Trade"
COL_antisocialist_trade_idea_1: "Well Oiled Political Machine"
COL_socialisteconomy_desc: "As part of our new benevolent rule, a new economic system is put in place, as it has already been done in other parts of the world. The end goal is for the means of production to be held by the workers, but at the moment the effort is concentrated primarily on securing economic independence from foreign capital, which has proven difficult because of the capitalistic pigs in our vicinities. This radical shift will prove to be difficult to implement, but Colombia has previously shown that it is ready to deal with difficult situations such as this. It is only a matter of time before the growing pains subside."
COL_industrialist_protest: "Industrialists Protest"
COL_industrialist_protest_desc: "Remnants of the Old Colombia still resist our rightful rule. The industrialists are protesting the implementation of new measures proposed by the Revolutionary Congress to empower labor unions and redistribute wealth. This is having terrible effects on our economy, as factories are closing en masse in a misguided attempt to stop the socialist forces or at least to force concessions from them. We must act before the masses of unemployed turn on us in an unjust rage."
COL_industrialist_protest_crushed: "Industrialists Protest Crushed"
COL_industrialist_protest_crushed_desc: "The worst has come to an end. The industrialists protested the implementation of new measures proposed by the Revolutionary Congress to empower labor unions and redistribute wealth, closing factories and shops en masse in attempt to stop the socialist forces or at least to force concessions from them. The governament has responded rapidly and with force, dispersing the crowd and forcing the strikers to reopen their workplaces, one way of another."
COL_helping_the_darien: "Helping the Darien"
COL_helping_the_darien_desc: "The Darien, once Department of Chocó, was one if not the first spanish settlement in Colombia. Since then, because of the large abundance of inhospitable forest and swamps, the region developed much less and at a slower pace than the rest of the country. We have granted The Darien provisory independence under collaborationist Leopardos government and promised them help to their economy in order to catch up with us."
COL_exiling_enemies: "Casting Out The Enemy"

COL_exiling_enemies_heavy: "Mass Exiling"
COL_exiling_enemies_heavy_desc: "Colombia cannot become a world power if the socialists and their allies keep getting in the way. Thankfully Arango Ramos has come up with a plan to exile our opposition immediately by setting up a puppet state in Chocó to keep the most troublesome citizens under careful watch. He'll figure out what to do with them..."
COL_political_turmoil: "Political Turmoil"
COL_political_turmoil_desc: "In a country where the two party system has always been the norm, the recent birth of minor parties led by ex-members of the Liberal and Conservative parties has moved the country’s political discourse to the extremes. Frequent episodes of violence have emerged in all of Colombia, especially in the zones furthest from the capital, where the state's grip is weakest. Many political analysts predict that at this rate we will have serious trouble to deal with in the next few years, and politically-motivated violence may become the norm."
COL_black: "Black Monday"
COL_black_desc: "Black Monday had a very harsh effect on Colombia's economy, with a large part of the population suddenly becoming jobless and losing their livelihood as companies folded almost overnight. Massive changes will be necessary to stop this economic disaster and put the country back on its feet!"
COL_black_2: "Recovering from Black Monday"
COL_black_2_desc: "The first signs of a recovery are starting to appear as Colombia's economy seems to be turning a corner, but there is still much more work to be done if we wish to boast that we have beaten this crisis."
COL_black_over: "¡Adios Black Monday!"
COL_black_over_desc: "Finally the era of Black Monday has become a thing of the past. No one will miss these hard times and Colombia is celebrating her victory against the grim fate that at first seemed inevitable. Business seems to be returning to pre-crisis levels, and people are celebrating and chanting in the streets: 'Adios Black Monday, may you never come back'."
COL_bogotazo: "¡El Bogotazo!"

Turns out as soon as the land was brought by his son the president signed a decree to make a speedway pass throu it, with the intent of making the value of the land raise exponentially. And that but only one of the times Lopez Pumarejo used his power for his own gain.

COL_approach_the_liberals: "Approach the Liberal Party"
COL_approach_the_liberals_desc: "Since the moment the Liberal Party lost his hegemony over national politics due to the failed reforms of Alfredo Lopez Pumarejo and his subsequent resignation when tensions with Peru started rising, the colombian's most progressive party has been deemed as a thing of the past, unable to offer a real alternative to the masses of progressive leaning voters that are now looking elsewhere for their vote. Some have found a new hope in our centrist position, others are supporting the UNIR movement. More than a few thought that the Partido Conservador and the far right movements such as the Leopardos and Chulavitas could answer their plea for change. However what our administation relized is that if we want to bury the hatchet and bring about a new era of peace in this country of ours the best bet is to have the experience and prestige of one of the longest standing party on our side and as such the possibility of a union between APEN and Partido Liberal has been seen the best bet in keeping our name on the top position in the ballotts now that the Partido Conservador has declared their intention of setting up a government without our partecipation. As such we will initiate a descussion to bring the two parties togheter and side with what the left side of our party always suggested to be the only solution, thus eliminating the possibility that the tracherous conservatives or even worse the socialists could surpass us in the next election."

As such a new opportunity arises: to set up a private training zone open to all socialists volunteers from across the continent.

Something obviously must be done about this! These laws and programs shall be stricken from the record, and those of Ayran blood forced to marry into our race and produce at least one mixed children or leave the country. Along with this, new laws and programs will be undertaken to encourage a growth in Latino births. Special attention must be paid to the black and native populations that dot Colombia as well.

No, Christ's message one was of internal growth and understanding of the light that is within us and within all things. By this logic, Christian Corporations shall also be made to accept workers of all creeds as long as their inner lights shine bright in their hearts, by force if necessary.

They point out all our andean nations, like most of northern South America, were freed by Simon Bolivar and are committed to the same ideals of liberty and freedom. To strike them down would be a tragedy, or so they claim. Their opponents however, see this as an opportunity. Venezuela is weak and divided.

### General Events ###
col.1.t: "Colombia's place in the world"
col.1.d: "Politics in our country were never stable.\nWeakened by numerous civil wars and with the growing number of strikes and unrest, tensions flared in 1928 as the conservative government approved of the massacre of a group of banana workers near Santa Marta on the orders of the United Fruit Company. Estimates of the number of deaths ranged from 47 to as high as 2000. Public outcry ensued and a then-fringe faction lead by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán managed to swing the congress into adopting extensive measures to limit the power of the armed forces and punishing those responsible for the 'Bananeras Massacre'.\nHaving lost support in the congress the conservatives ceded power to the liberals who formed a government in 1930.\n\nJust two years later a dispute over territory in the Amazon rainforest and control of the economically strategic Rio Putumayo caused a regional conflict between our forces and Peruvian troops which escalated into a formal war. International support soon backed each side while the Conservative Party staunchly opposed the government's diplomatic effort. An emergency military junta was quickly formed to lead the country throu war.\nThe war lasted one and a half years before a miscalculated intervention by Ecuador, who were given a provocatory ultimatum by Peru, opened a new frontline in Guayaquil and the surrounding areas.\nBecause of the disastrous state of the army due to the extensive reforms following the 'Bananeras Massacre' scandal, Peru was able to swiftly conquer the rest of Ecuadorian territories and could push directly into our heartland.\nThe following treaty was humiliating as we lost a large portion of its southern lands.\n\nOnce again, the army fell out of favor and a large majority of the colombian people, dissatisfied with the poor handeling of the war crisis by both historical party demanded changes in the goverment.\nThe socialist formed UNIR, a coalition of all socialist parties, while moderate liberals and nationalists orchestrated the birth of a new party, APEN, essentially centrist in nature but that could function as a catch-all party. The day after its creation, APEN had already being assigned the post of leading the country, with the promise of working once more to heal Colombia's wounds..."
col.1.a: "The future await us."
col.2.t: "Rojas Pinilla Returns from Germany"
col.2.d: "Last night Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla landed safely in Bogotá after his time abroad in Germany, and with good news. Having been sent as an unofficial ambassador and attaché as a sign of respect between our nations, as well as to secure an official arms deal with the Kaiserreich that would see us buy ammunition, aircrafts, and naval designs; it is now safe to say that the meeting was a success, and we can expect the first wave of supplies to arrive soon. Rojas Pinilla, in a report to the press, had stated that he was impressed by the advancements that the Germans had achieved, and was sure that a greater economic link would only benefit Colombia in the long run."
col.2.a: "Welcome back."
col.3.t: "Black Monday is a disaster for the Colombian economy"
col.3.d: "With the sudden crash of the German stock market, many nations including Colombia are sailing through troubled waters. Economists predict that without rapid industrialization and a sudden shift in economic policy, the future for the Colombian people could become desperate. Many foreign investors are already fleeing the country. The world steps closer to the verge of collapse."
col.3.a: "We should pray for Colombia's salvation."
col.4.t: "Violence erupts!"
col.4.d: "Heated political discussion between Colombia's left and right wing parties has been a staple of our country for a long time. Many older people still remember our last civil war, while many in the younger generation find themselves without a father or a grandad.\nRecently, with the devastating and inevitable crash of the Berlin Stock Exchange, the economic crisis that ensued and shook our country left our citizens enraged and in despair. More and more people are starting to lose faith in the democratic system and resorting to the long established colombian tradition of turning against in rage. Many supporters of the two old parties, the Liberal and the Conservative, have launched attacks on the publications supporting the opposing side. Others were caught throwing rocks at our local headquarters, many buildings were set on fire and there have been a severe increase of murders expecially against our supporters, that were suprised by their assassins while at work, at church or even in their own homes. This new wave of violence is currently confined to the coastal cities, but soon it could spread to our capital and other major urban centers in the interior. Meanwhile, although the army has been deployed to maintain order, certain elements within the army are also fanning the flames of hate against UNIR voters. People's militias are starting to organize in the Meta and Chocó department, where the government's control is weakest, proclaiming their need for self-defence. Some of them are even calling for a nationwide revolution, which could result in a large-scale civil war.\n\nThe situation is getting increasingly desperate with every hour that passes. No less desperate is the state of our army, which is underequipped and filled with subversive elements. Should we trust Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla and his men or should we, rather, maintain our diplomatic attitude?\nActually... there could be another solution. We could follow the example of the Chulavitas and create a self defence force, giving the means to our people to protect their families and their country."
col.4.a: "Everybody got paramilitary formations and we should have one too."
col.4.b: "Keeping the peace should be our priority, we'll side with the army."
col.4.c: "We better proceed carefully."
col.5.t: "¡El Bogotazo!"
col.5.d_1: "Despite the government's attempts to suppress the militias and their Socialist allies, violence has spread across the nation to Cali, Medellín and Bogotá. In Bogotá an attempt was made to kill the leader of the UNIR leader Gaitán earlier this morning, but the politician has managed to miraculously survive the assasination. An enraged mob of people sympathetic to Gaitán pursued the shooter and lynched him to death. His body disappeared and along with it, his identity and motive remain unknown.\n\nMany theories have sprung up about who the killer was and how he got so close to his elusive target. The Leopardos claim the shooter was a Chulavitas, members of the military pin him to a rogue totalist militia disatisfied with his big tent approach and some even say it was our doing!\nThis incident has led to massive disorder and renewed fighting in the streets. Buses have been set on fire, shops looted and destroyed, and police vehicles stolen. Chaos has sunk its claws deep into our nation. News of the attempt has spread to the more rural areas of our nation where the violence was just as serious as it was in the cities. In some areas the people have risen up and thrown out government officials. The nation is descending into anarchy and while many anarchists and criminals prowl the streets many more God fearing Colombians bar their doors closed and pray for the violence to end soon, one way or another."
col.5.d_2: "In spite of, or maybe because of, our caution in dealing with the militia and the Socialist allies, violence now grips the cities of Cali, Medellín and Bogotá. In Bogotá a gunman tried to kill the leader of the UNIR leader Gaitán earlier today while he was about to attend a regular morning congress session, but the politician has managed to miraculously survive the assasination. An enraged mob of people sympathetic to Gaitán pursued the shooter and lynched him to death. His body disappeared and along with it, his identity and motive remain unknown.\n\nIn the place of an official motive many theories have arisen. Some blame military members associated with the Chulavitas, others chalk it up to a rogue totalist militia disatisfied with his big tent approach and some even say it was our fault despite the fact we are trying to keep the peace! The attempt has only fed into the chaos and fighting on the streets. Buses are overturned and burned, shops have been destroyed and looted and the police are struggling to respond. Anarchy reigns on the streets of Colombia. The violence has also crept into the countryside where the situation was just as tense, blowing the lid off of years of simmering tensions. The nation is falling apart..."
col.5.a: "There must be a light at the end of the tunnel..."
col.6.t: "Troubles in Bucaramanga"
col.6.d: "Following our administration's decision to organize our own paramilitary force - the Cachiporros - all seemed to be going according to our plans. That was, however, until the assassination attempt on Socialist firebrand Jorge Eliécer Gaitán - an enemy of our democracy, but beloved by a small, fanatic minority within our electoral base. It seems some of our Cachiporros did not get the memo to not throw in with the socialists of Gaitán - the greater of two evils - over the Chulavitas, that as just as bad but that are not at this moment our primary objective, for that hitting them helps the 'comrades' more then it helps our democracy. What can we expects from the illiterate farmers who largely comprise our more radical base? They cannot understand that our political landscape has shifted, that Gaitán is not their 'friend' anymore, if ever he was; that he is just interested in making his dream of a totalitarian state.\nRegardless, some Cachiporros loyal to his image have spiraled out of control and into mayhem as they take justice and retribution into their own hands; these kind of violent episodes have come to a gruesome head in the city of Bucaramanga.\n\nA known conservative stronghold, Bucaramanga is a central base of operations for the Chulavitas - a fact our Cachiporros know all too well. Marching 'the petrolium city' with machetes and rifles drawn, our Cachiporros began to mercilessly cut down any random citizen - both militant and civilian - that crossed their path in brutal fashion. With a hack off a limb here and a shot through the head there, our bloodthirsty troops ravaged the zone like a pack of wild, savage beasts. The situation only escalated when police forces were brought in, who began to indiscriminately fire upon all suspects, with more innocents tragically being gunned down in the crossfire. In the initial scuffle between their forces, two policemen were shot dead, and taking advantage of the brief lapse in enemy fire, some of our forces fled to a nearby ranch to hide out. However, when they arrived, they found the ranch occupied by the family who worked it, and instead of simply letting them go, our paramilitary troops made the situation even worse by taking the married couple and their four children hostage."
col.6.a: "Call the police immediatly! Call the army, also! Whatever it takes..."
col.6.b: "Making this public is too dangerous. Let the Cachiporros disappear into the night."
col.7.t: "The Hostage Situation Turns Ugly"
col.7.d: "Last night, as soon as the hostage situation was given in the capable hand of the police and the local army garrison, the law officers decided to send in their elite special forces squad to deal with the delicate turn of events, but on this bloody day, even hostage negotiations were doomed to fail. Though it is currently unknown if the police were aware the Cachiporros had hostages with them in the farmhouse, they were well aware the paramilitary forces were using it as a hideout, and without hesitation, the police commander ordered every one of his officers to fire upon the building. In a cacophony of splintering wood, singed materials from the heat of gun brass, and with crimson blood flying through the air, the lives of all inside - both combatant and hostage - were erased in one violent instant. \n\nAs tragic of an incident as this 'Massacre of Bucaramanga' has become, the reverberations it has caused are of an even greater magnitude. People across the nation are demanding an explanation as to how so many innocent lives were so callously thrown away. Our former-allies among the Conservatives and Liberals - who once tolerated our moderated syncretic approach to politics as an alternative to the Pumarejo camp - now call for our resignation, turning their backs on those who aided them in their time of need. Even our armed forces are enraged over the incident, shaming us for using unproven and wild paramilitaries instead of just simply calling in the national military.\n\nWith so many of our former allies and supporters now putting up obstacles and standing before us as foes, our administration's hands are tied, and we are left with two options. We can either attempt to diplomatically approach this mess, reaching out to the army, and to Laureano Gómez Castro in order to keep the peace, or we can simply deny all responsibility and blame the whole thing on independently acting paramilitary commanders. However, it is not likely the rest of the nation will buy this excuse. What shall we do?"
col.7.a: "Deny any and all involvement! The Cachiporros acted alone and without guidance."
col.7.b: "Own up to our grievous mistake and attempt to reconcile with those we have offended."
col.8.t: "A Win For The Army"
col.8.d: "A few minutes after the protest started a brief but decisive intervention by the army restored peace in the centre of Bogotá, with the use of every means necessary, including tear gas and bullets. The soldiers then moved to the Barrios Unidos and Egipto districts, where it was believed militia leaders were directing their irregulars, and both districts were secured within thirty minutes or so.\n\nHowever, this is far from the end of our difficulties. Rojas Pinilla himself advised following this first action with a decisive blow to come tomorrow, implying that acting later than this date would render the entire operation futile.\nThe plan is for the army to work with the police to block all major city entry points and to conduct massive searches in the homes and vehicles of politically active citizens. He then assured that this will not escalate further, limiting our people's God-given rights, but will only be the necessary actions to ensure that peace is maintained within our borders.\n\nAs promising as this plan may appear at first glance, we must also consider the number of claims of misbehavior and simply stupid initiatives carried out by our troops during today's intervention, with the total number of casualties far exceeding what our chief strategist anticipated.\nOne example is already spreading through word of mouth. One colonel and his soldiers stormed into a Carrera 7 pub and demanded that all bottles of beer be handed over to him. They started drinking and when they were completely wasted, they demanded to play Tejo. As we all very well know Tejo is a very dangerous party game to play while drunk because it involves throwing small explosives into small holes, but it becomes even more dangerous if you decide to throw your hand grenade instead of the standard equipment.\nIf this was an isolated incident, there would be no reason to be concerned, but it appears that not all stories are as colorful as this one, and allowing the army to do whatever they want could pose a very real danger."
col.8.a: "Who can we trust if not the Army? Let them carry out the plan."
col.8.b: "I think that what we did is already enough."
col.9.t: "It's 1928 All Over Again"
col.9.d: "Today, two distinct scenes were demonstrated, both of which piqued our people's interest and exposed the cracks that are engreined in our society. The first occurred in the streets in front of a very old and dilapidated building in the Chapinero neighborhood. Two people, a man and a woman, screamed and shouted as their son is thrown into the back trunk of a military vehicle, as were hundreds or even thousands more in other streets and districts throughout Bogotá. Sedition is the same verdict for all of them. They all have the same judge and jury: the soldiers carrying out the largest anti-rebellion operation in our country's history...\nMany of these arrests, we are already learning just hours in, are being carried out based on little to no evidence. Mostly because some neighbor denounced them.\n\nThe second scene occurred in parliament during today's joint session. Both the right opposition stood up and screamed at the top of their lungs about the travesty of the entire affair while the left wing one began suggesting that the ministers mothers entertain patrons while the ministers fathers are not home. Someone from the Conservative Party even attempted to bring a concealed gun into Parliament, but was apprehended and arrested for sedition.\nDuring the long barrage of insults and protests, a man with a cast stood up and raised his hand, suggesting that he be allowed to speak. The speaker instinctively gave him the right in the midst of the chaos, and the entire assembly stopped screming and turned to him. It was a slightly fatigued Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, that, once given the permission, just said 'This nation deserves better than a dishonorable president letting his army play pub games with live grenades'. Some members laughed, others booed, and some even raised their hands to respond appropriately.\n\nAs the session ended and the congressmen exited the building, silence descended on the palace where once stood Simon Bolivar and all our great heroes who have since passed away."
col.9.a: "Such a gloomy day."
col.10.t: "UNIR Protests Military Actions with a Silent March"
col.10.d: "UNIR's leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán organized, along with support from the Syndicalist and Totalist factions, what has now been dubbed the 'Silent March' across Bogotá. Approximately a hundred thousand participants are participating alongside the organizers, utilizing absolute silence from all of the demonstrators to denounce the recent episodes of violence that have shaken the country. Gaitán has used the march to call for an end to the government's use of the police and military forces to repress political opposition and invites us to confront the issue in a more civil and constitutional manner. As boots unceremoniously meet the cobbled roads of the city, there is no chanting or screaming, only silence. Although today's protest has thus far proceeded without incident, another protest is already scheduled for next Sunday in Manizales, with another in Villavicencio in the works.\n\nIronically, on the other side of Colombia, the same people advocating for a peaceful solution to our country's problems defile it with violence and brutality. The militias run amok in the countryside. Our administration hears nothing but horror stories from those who cross paths with these brigands - tales of looting, pillaging, and absolute savagery are widespread. Masked raiders sack and loot local businesses and properties to buy equipment and ammunition and then use those to loot some more, thus repeting the vicious cycle. One man even tells his own savage tale of the socialist's brutality: upon being captured and his conservative ideals being revealed, the militia used him to bait his family into emerging from their hiding spots around the surrounding property. Upon capturing the entire family, the man was forced to watch as soldiers asked his brother if he wanted to 'race' or be shot. Not knowing what that meant exactly the man chose the former and four soldiers simultaneously held him down, doused him with fuel, and set him ablaze, watching carefully as he fled down the street eventually falling down a cliff. While the survivor looked on in abject terror, these terrorists laughed while others grumbled, upset at their lost bet.\n\nDespite the current peaceful veneer Gaitán is trying to lend the protests, officials in the army are asking us to end this charade, fearing that the country's security might continue to slip if these socialists keep propagandize their fanatical message.\nShould we grant the army authorization to utilize force to disperse the protestors if they don't comply with orders?"
col.10.a: "Violence begets violence. Send in the army!"
col.10.b: "Bring Gaitán to the table. If he truly belives in peace we can have a ... truce."
col.11.t: "Desperate Times, Desperate Measures"
col.11.d_1: "The terrorists based in Bucaramanca must be patting themselves on the back pretty hard to have pulled their little stunt so easily. They are seemingly oblivious to the fact we let them get away with it. Our inaction has however gained quite a bit more attention than we hoped and already reporters are printing incendiary columns damning our administration. Our people.

Of course its simply a magical coincidence that our protege Bonito Vega will lead the court and the jury will be stacked with government loyalists.\n\nIn fact, it worked better than we could've hoped for. Many of Rojas Pinilla's allies who we expected to have to neutralize have come out against him with some very colorful language.

They demanded for the newspaper to print a list of their proposed solutions to our country's problems for the whole of Colombia and even the world to see. The text opens with an accusation of ineptitude by our government, due to our inability to settle the situation still ongoing in Antioquia, which they say would 'easily be resolved' by simply accepting the demands of strikers and by answering their plea for improved working conditions. What follows is a long list of claims and grievances separated by demands coming from each faction. Chief among the claims are the de-escalation of the Bogotazo situation by freezing all army's funds, a proposed non agression pact with the French Commune and passing a decree to abolish, at least at a formal level, underage work.\n\nThey can claim otherwise, but the middle class colombian knows that what [COL.GetColombianTotLeaderFullName] and all his criminal friends want is to take power and reign supreme.

They also demand we cease our efforts to secularize public education and instead make it based around promoting Catholic values for men and traditional housekeeping roles for women, constitutionally guaranteeing the Church's sovereignty and dominance and lastly adopting more leaniant and progressive taxation policies.

People started gathering as Rojas Pinilla began to read a local newspaper pointing out all the articles that related to socialist militias and extrajudicial assassinations, according to him. At the end of his performance the list amounted to 27 just for yesterday.

He threatened to confirm to the public some of the rumors that see us as secretly siding with Gaitan. Felix was once a very loyal supporter of our mission to bridge the gap between moderate liberalism and the right wing Partido Conservador, so we took him on board with the intention to make him a figurehead for the catholic voters, however the Jesuit scholar and humanist once believed to be just another inoffensive erudite has now finally shown his true colors.\n\nOur security minister has proposed the solution of sending him abroad for some days and meanwhile contacting the president's brother Carlos Lozano y Lozano, then swapping the two by firing Felix at his return. The majority of our party would be upset and the public would probably take Felix's side, but in these dire times, the might as well be too distracted to make a big deal out of it.\nThen again we could always try and convince him to remain, by promising him to take a more anti-socialist position and by donating a generous sum to his Caro y Cuervo fundation, or whatever else he will require."

So far, total number of casualties alludes us as the authorities are still investigating the area and excavating the rubble for more bodies. However, news of this travesty has already spread like wildfire, and it has thrown many people in the cities into almost mass hysteria out of fear of yet another attack. Furthermore, the police have yet to arrest any suspects involved. Therefore, it seems that the perpetrators of this heinous crime will get away unscathed.\n\nMany members of our party are now calling for emergency elections, which may work in our favour if we announce it on the 20th of July - our Independence Day - in order to reassure that it won't be another fad.

Obviously, this statement has garnered much praise from both like-minded sympathizers and the afrocolombians themselves, and many have seen their confidence increase as a response to the afrocolombians now becoming even more active in the politics of the country. Whether this support will be maintained and whether Gaitán will uphold his words is yet to be seen."

col.21.d: "Our head of ministers, Eduardo Santos Montejo, brought us intriguing news this morning. His loyalty and utility are unquestionable, and in his capacity as the owner of El Tiempo, the most popular centrist newspaper, he has now demonstrated his value as an effective insider for propaganda efforts.\nOne of El Tiempo's investigative journalists has unearthed a significant scoop today—a revelation that has the potential to favor us while undermining our far-right opponents. Evidently, there is documented evidence indicating that before departing from the Conservative Party, Laureano Gomez Castro had engaged in discussions about ousting Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla from the military. Castro even reportedly proposed using covert tactics to put an end to the Marshal's career. However, that's not all!\nIt turns out that Gomez Castro wasn't always supportive of his current allies. He actively worked to undermine the possibility of the Leopardos joining the Conservative Party altogether. A reliable source closely associated with the Chulavitas leader has disclosed that Gomez Castro extensively lobbied for a veto on all Leopardos members entering the bipartisan system. Our allies have confirmed this, adding that Gomez Castro frequently denigrated the populist group, referring to them as 'a bunch of no-brain hypocrites and lowlife scums who would serve the country better by turning a gun on themselves.'.\n\nAs rumors of a coalition between Chulavitas and Leopardos rapidly circulate, a scandalous revelation like this could potentially dismantle any prospects of an alliance between them, thereby strengthening our position in the polls. However, the flip side is that without a robust opposition bloc against the socialists, this revelation could also benefit UNIR and enhance their chances of securing the presidency. The question before us now is: should we give make El Tiempo publish this groundbreaking article or not?"

These parties, along with a few local minor groups, formalized their alliance today under the banner of the Nationalist Bloc. They present this coalition as a fresh conservative movement focused on countering socialism, reevaluating racial and purity issues, and fostering new job opportunities for the nation.\nWhat initially seemed an unlikely partnership between the Chulavitas and the Leopardos has evolved into a shared agenda, overcoming historical ideological tensions arosing from the Leopardos contrarian stance toward the almost theocratic religious views of Gomez.\n\nA strong nationalist footprint pervades the document and openly asserts the intention to elevate Colombia's geopolitical significance, a position they assert should have been achieved already. Some military leaders, including Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla, have offered their endorsement to presidential candidate Laureano Gomez, pledging their full support.\n\nWhile there are numerous shared values between the two parties, substantial differences could hinder the project's realization. Foremost is the religious issue: both parties agree that Colombian citizens should abide by Biblical principles, but they diverge on the role of the Christian Church in politics, weather the state should become one with the Church or if religious men should only act as 'shepards for the people'. Additionaly Gomez is seen as much more pragmatic then the others, and that is saying something given the prevailing portrayal of Gomez as a hotheaded individual by Liberals and Conservatives alike."

In preparation of the upcoming elections, the members of the party held a vote to designate the party's candidate for the presidency. Various aspirants from within the party nominated themselves for the job and espoused their vision on how to win the election and what they would accomplish as leader. We did the same. In the smoky backroom discussions that unfolded as the conference went on, a consensus began emerging around party leaders that a new face should represent APEN.\n\nThe party is split between supporting two main candidates, nearly half of the voters felt that Gabriel Echavarria Misas previous experience in business and his popularity with moderates and lobbyists could be seen by our electorate as a concrete effort to turn the sorry situation the country is living in right now into a new dawn of peace and prosperity, while the other half see Francisco Anastasio Pérez, also known by the nickname Mamatoco, as a possible popular figure that even if inexperianced could secure the presidency and empower the police force as he long promised to do, plus he has bluit over the years around himself an image of a radical libertarianist that many congressman approve of.\nA minor yet strong support for the experienced journalist and our current head of cabinet Eduardo Santos Montejo emerged, meaning a wing supporting us and a continuation of our centrist policies has emerged.

With his potent oration, Castro captivated his audience with the idea of securing the Catholic faith firmly as an integral part of Colombia, whilst shaming our government for not paying attention to what the nation and its people truly need to thrive: a stronger, more centralised state. He then attacked his main rival candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, calling his last week speech in defence of the afrocolombian people 'just empty rethoric coming from a mestizo man who never actually did anything first hand to help minorities'.\n\nJust before the end of his speech however a person in the public screamed at the top of his lungs insulting Gomez and asking repetedly if he will turn his back on his supporters just like he did to his potential allies.

The candidate then addressed again his public adding 'I've got proofs that this slanderous and false accusations came directly from UNIR that is helping the government behind your backs! Truth is, the president is sleeping with the enemy!'\n\nThanks to this speech and some others beforehand, he has managed to further his popularity for the catholics and conservative voters, and will definitely see increased support at the upcoming elections, while our reputation has been tarnished by the rumors that sees us as a lap dogs of UNIR."

After some time, his verbal barrage slowly devolved into the ramblings of an old, slightly deranged vagabond as he went on about the importance of self reliance and the dangers of unjust hiearchies.

col.26.d: "Previously, we believed that Quintin Lame, once a leader of a significant native uprising during the last civil war, had retired from his activism. However, recent events suggest that this prominent native leader has once again taken charge of his people.\nIt appears Lame has launched an official manifesto advocating for robust measures to safeguard the indigenous populations of the Andes.\n\nThe manifesto centers around the core principle of indigenous self-governance and complete autonomy within historically and culturally significant ancestral areas. These areas include, but are not confined to, Zipaquirá (near Bogotá), substantial regions in the Cauca department, the Guajira, and the Sierra Nevada in the Caribbean region. Additionally, the manifesto proposes the establishment of a new governmental oversight agency empowered to veto any government actions targeting these regions and composed entirely of ethnically indigenous people.\n\nLame also conveyed to journalists his willingness to collaborate with Gaitán and his coalition, provided they commit to upholding the manifesto's tenets. This alignment isn't unexpected, as Lame has a longstanding history of working closely with syndicalist activists—many of whom are still active within certain factions, and some of whom are likely to become ministers should UNIR win the election. However, Lame pointed out that despite Gaitán's public discourse on indigenous rights, he has yet to engage in direct dialogue with any native leaders, including Quintin himself. Consequently, Lame remains uncertain about whether the largely underrepresented indigenous people of Colombia can genuinely place their trust in Gaitán.\n\nWhile they haven't formally requested our assistance to enact these demands, their political intentions are now clearer than before."

This is significant because, on the Atlantic coast as well as the Pacific one, the presence of the African population is rather strong. In other words, because of their numbers, we should be both vigilant and careful about the possibility of a radical Afrocolombians uprising if, God knows how, they manage to swing the rest of their ethnic group against the democratic institutions and support UNIR and their wicked plans instead. That is implying that UNIR itself is not behind this sudden surge of awareness, which most probably is the case.

He couldn't have anticipated that as he entered his local church in Medellin, as he did every morning before work, he would be confronted not by his dear friend Don Pablo, the church priest, but by three soldiers ready to take him out.\nDespite his obliviousness of his fate, Diego Nunez Castillo knew that destiny would eventually catch up with him since the day he joined the Chulavitas militia.\n\nIn an effort to curtail both the fundamentalist Catholic militia and the socialist group, the army had gathered intelligence on the most vocal members of both factions. The victim of this story was one of those under surveillance.\nUnder direct orders from high-ranking generals, the army proceeded to eliminate the perceived threats, but in the case of Diego Nunez Castillo, they tragically exceeded all bounds. Not only did they end his life within the confines of a church, but according to a classified document, they also subjected him to immense suffering before taking his life.\n\nAt this time the information is still evades the press and the general public, but soon enough if action is not taken people will find out the truth. We received Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla in our offices to answer of the fact and, opposite of what we thought it would happen, his arrogant demeanor was nowhere to be found in this occasion. The deeply concerned general expressed sorrow and an apparent sense of shame for his men's actions.\nNonetheless asked the government to keep this the public from discovering what happened in their own interest. He argued that if the news were to become known, the consequences could be dire, but he prompltly added that he would understand and accept that boundries where crossed and that it would be morally reprehensible to keep Nunez Castillo family in the dark.\n\nThere is also a strong case of making Nunez Castillo a national hero and declare he died for his country, in case we want to make Laureano Gomez Castro and his Chulavitas more combactive and liked by the people, and God knows they need that more than ever with the recent polls seeing a rapid increase in popularity of Gaitan and his associates."

Bus driver Gonzalo Castillo has placed so many sacred images on his bus that he has effectively blocked all windows, not permitting any light to come through it.\nAs any Colombian of goodwill and strong inventive mind would do, he found a solution by simply purchasing candles from a local church auction and using them to light up his colectivo bus. It is said that during one of his routes from Barranquilla to Bogotá, all his passengers felt so deeply moved by this display of faith —perhaps influenced by the trapped smoke— that everyone kept reciting collective prayers and raising their skinny fingers like antennas to heaven.\n\nNewspapers picked up the story and across the country many intermunicipal bus companies proposed emulating the actions of Gonzalo Castillo. One even suggested creating an official route from Cali to Pasto, effectively turning it into a 'church on wheels' with a proper priest delivering proper religious services and sermons to travelers.

Settling down into the government offices we earned, we look at the millions of ballots the traditional parties of the conservatives and liberals lost to us.\nWith our political opponents in the election utterly defeated, it is time that we look to the future of this new Colombia.\nAlready we have taken the first steps, having announced the first National Revolutionary Congress which is set to begin in Bogatá in a matter of days. The other socialist parties within the UNIR Bloc have already confirmed their attendance, including the PSC and UTC. The primary topic that many predict will dominate the Congress is said to be the issue of implementing socialist reforms to the country, and how it should be brought about. Concerns regarding our position as a nation in not only South America, but possibly the world, have also begun to spring up and it will indeed be a matter of great importance later down the line.\n\nIt is clear now that this Congress will be quite the hotspot of debate and ideological conflicts, therefore it is imperative that we ensure Colombia does not divide itself even more than it already has."
colsoc.1.a: "Let the National Congress begin!"
colsoc.2.t: "The Congress Begins: Economy"
colsoc.2.d: "The Congress has begun, with the important issue of economy being the first to be discussed amongst the various socialist parties.\nAfter some time, there was a general consensus on one aspect: to implement socialist reforms immediately is not feasible. The majority of attendees concurred that our primary focus should be on stabilizing and securing the economy, especially considering the widespread impact of Black Monday across the country. Furthermore, it was agreed that we should gently begin to implement state policies and investments as a starting effort to combat the economic inequality that is rife in Colombia.\n\nThe unanimous agreements began to end there, as there were different ideas on which exact sector of the economy should be given attention to first - UNIR and the PSC both agree that investing into developing resources is the right choice, however whereas the UNIR suggested further excavation in our more untapped regions, the PSC support the research of synthetic refineries as an attempt to boost our industrial management of our natural resources.\nOn the other hand, the Totalists call for dividing our economic efforts in two fronts, by boosting military spending and to keep our weapon factories up to date, seeing as our guns are essentially obsolete, simultaneously, stressing the importance of connecting rural areas to urban centers, thus incentivizing commerce and facilitating resource exchanges."

Now is no exception either - despite the economic plan decided on in the Congress being rather moderate, their leaders have denounced it and have organised a massive, nation-wide strike against us. It seems that their irrational fear of socialist policies is so strong that they are willing to plung the nation into further chaos just to politically starve and root us out, and this is evident by the fact that many factories and farms are shutting down in protest. We have had the Syndicalists and the UTC demand that we put an immediate end to this uproar by deploying militias and the army to restablish order and disperse the crowds gathering in the capital. However, our most trusted advisors within the party have reccomended a more soft-handed approach, and that we must placate the demands of the protestors."

colsoc.4.d: "TThe recent days within the Revolutionary Congress have proven challenging, to say the least. Although most of the topics brought forth were solved with little dispute, today the Revolutionary Congress have placed forth a far more controversial question - what will be Colombia's stance on foreign matters, and where will it stand on the international stage?\n\nFrom the early hours of the day, a heated debate has unfolded among the three branches of our political union, each providing a different answer. Eventually, a consensus was reached during the discussion when a delegate proposed shifting the focus of our foreign affairs deliberation towards handling neighboring countries, due to the imminent threat they could pose to our revolution. Our party took the initiative to address the importance of securing our nation's immediate future instead of seeking external conflicts. We suggested adopting an assertive approach if necessary, while simultaneously assuring our neighbors that our new revolution is unique in the Latin American context and emphasizing our commitment to domestic affairs. This, we argued, would safeguard national unity and serve as a model of resilience for other Socialist nations.\nThe PSC, in contrast, have thrown their support in with the Third Internationale, branding them the 'biggest safety net against the imperialist rats', despite acknowledging the Commune of France's limited support for their South American counterparts. They dismissed reassuring neighbors as a lesser priority for a genuine revolutionary state and concluded their stance with the famous Marx quote, 'workers of the world, unite.'.\nLastly, the Totalists have presented a solution centered on catching our adversaries off guard and mobilizing preemptively. However, [COL.GetColombianTotLeaderLastName] didn't clarify whether this involved Colombia's Commune initiating an attack on neighbors or merely a show of force to deter potential threats. Speculation arises that he may intend both options, adapting strategy as the situation evolves.\nHaving heard perspectives from all coalition parties, it is now time to adopt a collective stance on this pivotal matter..."

Adding to the turmoil, the Chulavitas have escalated violence to an unprecedented extent, aiding the protestors. Disturbingly, there's a growing number of reports detailing these terrorists attacking our party headquarters in Bogotá.\nSimilar incidents are unfolding in Barranquilla, where the protesters have turned hostile toward the police forces attempting to maintain order. This has led to numerous severe injuries and even a few fatalities.\n\nThe nation is gripped by a state of paralysis, with an impending crisis looming overhead. Each passing day further transforms our once-vibrant country into a desolate landscape, devoid of prosperity and dignity. Amidst this chaos, we find ourselves compelled to quell the protests through force, with no time to spare."

París Gordillo has been invited to Rojas Pinilla's villa located in the outskirts of Bogotá for what was described as a 'serious concern' in his letter. Soon our militiamen were in position, with the ends of their rifles glaring at every opening. Though there was no sign of the Field Marshal himself, our men waited patiently. As Gordillo arrived, he waited yet his host would never arrive.\n\nThe silence was broken as the screech of a bullet pierced the air - chaos erupted as the militiamen stormed into the house. Startled from the sudden uproar, it seemed that Gordillo had attempted to fire at one of the militiamen but was shot dead before he could pull the trigger. Further investigation found that the first shot was towards a figure that one of the men saw bolting from the back door, away into the wilderness. We can only conclude that it was Rojas Pinilla himself who managed to flee. That, and the fact that a sapphire-blue medal was discovered by the edges of the woods, cracked and chipped in its centre; it was the 'Orden de Boyacá', Rojas Pinilla's most prized possession.\n\nHe will most certainly never show his face around ever again, and as far as the rest of the nation is concerned, there was never a man by the name of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, or Gabriel París Gordillo."

They made a plea to us asking for aid in dealing with the current situation taking place in their country, and this has come as no surprise to our advisors. After all, since the victory of the Socialist coalition UNIR comprised of all kind of scummy socialists, it seems they have been dealing with a huge wave of crime and chaos across the nation.\nThe Chulavitas have told us of the brutal oppression that many peaceful protestors have faced in the last few days, which is not hard for us to believe considering the similar cases of socialists taking charge across the world in the recent past. They also tell us that many Colombian citizens are questioning the legitimacy of the election results.\n\nThey, along with other nationalist parties, are begging us to intervene immediately by supporting autonomous militias in order to ensure order and the defence of Christian values that UNIR have desecrated. By doing this, the Chulavitas leader Laureano Gomez Castro assures us that the Colombian government will quickly fall, but we cannot rely on his word alone - many figures in our own government have spoken out against intervening, not wanting to risk outright war.

But once we take a look at the possible cost of this, it makes it a more difficult decision. Our alternative would be to repurpose buildings that are not used and fix those that our citizens currently live in, much more cost effective however experts show it would be a temporary plug in the widening gap, meaning that we might be risking our reputation by passing the problem onto the next generation of government.

col.777.t: "Warning Signs"
col.777.d: "During the latest meeting of the ruling council of the main Leopardos some trouble arose. While Eliseo Arango and Jose Camancho Carreno spoke of their plans for the future which included fortifying the nations racial identity, championing anti-Imperialism and reshaping the armed forces, two other Leopardo idealogues, Augusto Ramierez Moreno and Joaquin Fidalgo Hermida stayed silent, sitting a corner smoking and paying little if any attention.\nWhen Arango addressed them and asked for their opinions they responded curtly, exchanged glances then returned to their previous routine of smoking and disinterest. The rest of the meeting went smoothly but at the end Villegas called Camancho aside and told him what was going on.\n\nMoreno and Hermida had attended a recent lecture given by philosopher Fernando Gonzalez Ochoa, a man known in Leopardos and outsiders circles, mainly for his views on Latin racial purity, complete state-church separation, esotericism, and for his love for Nietzsche and his theories. While to the average observer these views may seem not too different from our own, his goals differ a lot, as he considers nationalism and authoritarianism simply as a necessary mean to bring about a new age where every citizens is free from the state and lives according to his own personal principles in complete anarchy, an ideology he likes to call 'Anarcototalitarianism' as he explained in many of his books and more recently in his self-published newspaper 'Revista Antioquia'.\nIf we let Moreno and Hermida go they could rally more of these crypto-Oachian supporters to our cause or alienate the radicals and split the party. We must respond before things get out of hand."
col.777.a: "We shouldn't worry for now."
col.777.b: "Confront them at the next meeting."
col.777.c: "It's enough to expel them!"
col.778.t: "Ignorance Isn't Always Bliss"
col.778.d: "Augusto Moreno and Joaquin Hermida were once again quiet and all together disinterested during today's meeting, again; not speaking once during the entire event. At the end they spoke with each other and Villegas and, after a long discussion, resigned from the party.\n\nMoving quickly the Council has managed to talk to Villegas and has convinced him to revoke his resignation. However, that was only stemming the bleeding. Moreno and Hermida have already severed their ties with us."
col.778.a: "We don't need them."
col.779.t: "Reconciliation"
col.779.d: "At the next meeting we confronted Moreno and Hermida and, after a long and sometimes heated discussion, the pair were convinced to stay with us. They have agreed that leaving would split the party and leave us weaker than if we stay united. In return for their continued support we have agreed to adopt certain aspects of their new platform. This has left the more moderate and left wing of the party wary but through careful diplomacy we have managed to assuage their fears as well. The crisis has passed and we have come out the other side stronger than ever."
col.779.a: "¡Unidos en la victoria!"
col.780.t: "On the Edge of History"
col.780.d: "At today's meeting of the Council we wasted no time in laying into the treachery of Moreno and Hermida. Accusations of treason flew and emotions got heated. After the denunciations ended Moreno and Hermida exploded into a rage. They launched into a sudden and lengthy rant denouncing our ideals and views. They said the political landscape of Colombia has changed severely since the publication of our Nationalist Manifesto and events have outrun us. They then outlined their own view of a nationalist Colombia, united in spirit and purpose to uplift the Latin American man to his greatest form based on the ideas of Ochoa.\n\nThe dual speeches lasted a total of seven hours. At its end the ministers sat for a moment, frozen in shock and not a little bit of terror at the sheer anger and rage displayed by the two men. After a moment of silence the room erupted into a chorus of boos and cheers as each man picked their side. Satisfied by their actions, the two men then left the room without another word or so much as glancing at Carreno or Arango. Not long after Villegas, convinced by their passionate speeches, followed them out. Meanwhile Carreno and Arango looked at eachother with surprised and confused glances, still speechless and wondering what came next."
col.780.a: "That was something."
col.781.t: "Fracture"
col.781.d: "Today in a speech in Bogata Fernando Gonzales Ochoa, along with Moreno and Hermida, announced the formation of a new party opposed to the Leopardos. This is done in flagrant violation to the fact that by law, a law which was crafted in part by Moreno and Hermida themselves, political parties in Colombia are banned. The party clearly aims to stir up popular anger at the government and serve as a lightning rod for the former politicians displaced by the Leopardos's iron fisted rule. While the party is still in its infancy there is a lot to suggest they will quickly become the greatest threat the Leopardos have yet faced.\n\nOchoa, Moreno and Hermida are rather small political figures, but their message that our political program is behind the times resonates with much of the populace and even among our own Council who are now demanding we modernize our Party, starting with a new leader. Some have proposed Gilberto Alzate Avedano, one of the most reactionary Conservatives in government, to lead us to the future. Others worry Gilberto's greed and extremism would only alienate moderates in the party and tug at the seams of our state. Despite their reservations, for better and for worse, we must make a decision."
col.781.a: "Gilberto Alzate Avedano would make for a strong new figurehead."
col.781.b: "Stay the course that has brought us this far."
col.783.t: "Change of Leadership"
col.783.d: "With Moreno and Hermida calming down, we thought our problems were over. But Faith dealt us a bad hand once again. God knows how, the news of the mutiny spread around while we were still handling the situation and apparently the rumor also reached the ears of our international backers. We quickly turned into the laughing stock of the free world, so much so that one foreign prime minister very close to our government is already looking for other partners to deal with.\nThe dangerous split is about to damage our international reputation, least we act fast and decisevly demostrating to the world that we didn't just keep out fellow Leopardos in check but also made substancial changes to affirm our power. For this reason it was decided at today meeting of the ruling council for Gilberto Alzate Avedano, one of the most reactionary Conservatives in our government, to lead us to the future. Some may worry Gilberto's greed and extremism would only alienate moderates in the party and tug at the seams of our state. Despite their reservations, for better and for worse, we must show our international partners that we have a true leader for president and Carlos Cortes Vargas, may God bless him, simply doesn't suffice anymore."
col.783.a: "Gilberto will lead us to the future!"
col.782.t: "Skinning the Leopard"
col.782.d: "Today our folly has been made plain for all to see. The new party headed by Ochoa has gathered enough popular and military support to launch a bloodless coup. Supporters from all the political spectrum, from moderate socialists to radical democrats,joined forces to force the Leopardos out of the governement.\nDuring an emergency meeting of the ruling Leopardos Council, the military and activists occupied Bogotá and rounded up everybody in the government in one fell swoop. Not one bullet was fired, as all ministers and governament officials immediately turned their back on their party, and guards simply opened the doors to the Congress to let us in. No longer their closest allied seemed to care much for keeping them in power. Their disastrous goverment will go down in history as both the shortest and worst since the independence from Spain. Their repressive totalitarism has being replaced with another form of the same but with a very different mean: COMPLETE FREEDOM!\n\nAfter just two hours of radio silence Fernando Ochoa has been named leader of the new Colombia or as he calls it... Otraparte!"

#FOCUS EVENTS
colfocus.1.t: "Selecting a New Legislation"
colfocus.1.d: "Various new legilations came to the presidential desk after our request to our coalition to bring them to us. Our ministers and our coalition members brought twenty or so new propositions to implement in the near future. The party's secretary selected three of them, which, according to him, are the most effective and less difficult to implement.\n\nThe first one is about the implementation of tax breaks for foreign corporations, in order to boost our heavy industry and minerary economy. According to the paper, a Canadian businessman, CEO of a large multinational corporation, approached our foreign minister with the intention of setting up a new massive emerald industry in Meta in order to work and cut emeralds he will extract in the nearby Boyacá department. Unfortunately, the only remaining large emerald deposit not already conceded to private enterprises is almost entirely located right under a spot sacred to the indigenous people living there.\nThe second proposed legislation is one that is expected to help with the dire situation our armed forces are facing since the loss against Peru, by placing trying to shift the blame away from them and instead make it fall squarely on the shoulders of our predecessors shoulders.\nLastly an APEN senator proposed publicly a reform to the electoral system that will eliminate the possibility, introduced by the previous short-lived Pumarejo administration to form electoral coalitions and run as such. This proposition would be very interesting in that we at the moment are, according to our recent electoral polls, in the lead as a single party outside of coalitions, and because UNIR is leading in that category, once we make unlawful to run as such, they are bound to incour in internal problems as is often the case with socialist infighting. And once that is out of the way we could focus on regrouping the liberal party in one unitary party under our new centrist paradigm.\n\nNow is our time to act, we should focus on..."

colfocus.3.t: "APEN and Liberals, a Future Togheter?"
colfocus.3.d: "A few days ago in the APEN headquarters in Bogotá a gathering of politicians and journalists were all waiting for the most important announcement of recent times. Delegates from the Partido Liberal arrived in the early evening, joined us for a small buffet and later took their places amongs our representatives.\n\nAs ideas and polemics about their requests and intended plans filled the room with noise someone entered the room from the service door. It was Mario Galan Gomez, a new face inside the liberal party, which many pundits predict will lead the party once Pumarejo steps down or is forced to do so. Rather tame in apperance but very combattive in the political arena, he stood there and watched the room for some second before opening his arms and gesturing the sitting president to come to him and shake hands. The photographers readied their flashes and took pictures while all others kept talking about economic policies and budget.\nAmongs those who did not take an active part in the celebration there was ex-president Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo who sat at his honorary table and looked nervously at his watch all evening, lifting his glance maybe once or twice troughout the event.\n\nWhen the photos were taken and every argument amongs the delegates had finished being discussed the president took his place in front of the microphone as told everybody of APEN intention in the next election. The speech was met with applause from most present.\n\nYesterday, just as the doors to the presidential palace were about to be closed for the day, ex minister and Partido Liberal representative Dario Echandia brought the happy news that the party had decided to accept the offering from APEN and are ready for the next meeting to make the merge a reality.\nThen, as his glass was being filled with whisky in celebration of the great event, he asked the most important question. Who the president thought should be presented at the next joint delegation meeting to be voted as the next candidate for the highest office in Colombia. The president sat down as his desk and without esitation gave him his answer..."

However these people didn't let us completely empty ended as they propose a counter offer they feel we could both agree on. They have claimed for a long time now the island of San Andrés and Providencia which are not only far away and isolated but also of little effective use to us. Should we agree to cede those island to them and to maintain unaltered the benefit that we proposed in the previous proposition the deal we need so much could be signed and made official.\nIf its true that that arcipelago east of Nicaragua has always been more of a headache that of actual use, it's also true many of its inhabitants strongly belive they are Colombians in all effects and wouldn't agree to be forgot and sold off to the highest bidder.

People are requesting we make them pay and take what's ours by force but is that what's best at this moment? We are on route to become one of the world's superpowers, all signs of that happening are clear even to the most pessimist amongs our populace, and with or without more territories we are destinied for greatness. Is another war really necessary or would it boost the morale of our people? At this time nobody can tell, but with the diplomatic route out of the picture the only two relistic prospects at this time are that we either leave this metter for another time and let it go for now or wage war utilizing our propaganda offices to the max in order to reunite our historical lands once and for all."

Now is no more the time to play democracy.\n\nIf we want to rebuild our Gran Colombian dream from the ashes of time we need a supreme commander to rule it.

colfocus.70.d: "As the sun left his place to the dark night in the silent mountains of Cauca a column of people started marching though the city of Popayán branding torches and lanterns while chanting in a language foreign to the people living there. People quickly realized, as the mass were progressively getting closer to the city center, that those people were the man and women that follows Quintin Lame and that he himself was at the head of the group marching loudly down the streets.\nOnce everybody arrived at Popayán's 'Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Popayán' cathedral they sat on the ground while still chanting. The mayor and the local police chief were awakened by their relative spouses and run to the cathedral escorted by a small group of army cadets stationed in the military base. There Quintin Lame adressed them publicly and told them to deliver a message to the president in person.\n\nThe message said: 'The white man decided to declare war on his fellow white man. That doesn't concern us. However, me and many other Nasa people like me still rember in horror what happened last time a white man had taken up the arms against their brothers, my brother died in that was and my sister was forever scarred. The same happened to many other Nasa families.\nWe won't accept that this time. Either the white man keeps his hands off our ancestal territory or we will consider this as a matter of self-protection for our race. We demand to protect ourself without interference by the governement as we don't want your protection: keep your soldiers away from here'.\n\nNot long after the message was delivered via telegraphic communication the protesters rised up and went back, this time in silence, thou the mountains and toward their villages."

Black activists also started disappering in thin air, and the situation doesn't seems it will resolve by itself. Locals are sharing their racist view in public gathering places such as resturants and cafes, and they even raise their voice if they know there's a potential victim listening as a form of intimidation.\nIt seems that this exponential increase has started just after the Bogotazo happened, as the climate of hate exploded into violence, the repressed racist sentiments of many colombians reversed into the best thing the could find as an enemy.\n\nAt this moment a vast number of policemen and soldiers is keeping order in the biggest cities in the Caribe region, such as Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta, however the smaller ones and the countryside lacks control. It is expected we will intervene by sending more men to protect the population from itself, but the we will also need to strategically redeploy the vast resoruces that we are using to protect our ports and shipyards into guarding the countryside. If we don't we should consider the possibility the black activist still alive could foment more disorder in response to the open racism that is sweeping throu the country and if things get real bad it could also mean they could possibly start to actively help the socialist terrorist in the Caribe."

The Minister for Economic Development informs us that in Cartagena a recently set up shipbuilder factory has reached an inspiring record of efficiency and engeneerd then built the first completely afrocolombian made destroyer in the history of this country, that was aptly named 'José Antonio Galan' after the historical leader of the Comuneros rebellion of 1781. Elsewhere other outstanding efforts are being met by such factories as 'Refinería Nacional de Petróleo en Beneficio de la Revolución' in Barrancabermeja who managed to already set a standard for petroleum refineries worldwide and the 'Fábrica Textil Comunitaria del Cauca' that opened last month in Cali.\n\nNot everybody however understood what the definition of factory is, it seems. A case in particular caught the attention of the people living in Boyacá. In that region a massive industrial building was erected near Sogamoso by decision of local state representatives however the use was unknown to us up until last week. It seems these people didn't know what Boyacá could specialize in so they decided that they should invest in mass producing...arepas! The very popular food made of mais flour and cheese is present in kitchen thouout the country but it is an essential part of boyacenese cousine in particular and as such some visionaries thought that their essential input to our revolution ought to be creating the very first and largest 'Fábrica Nacional de Arepas'.\n\nThanks to these combined efforts we are now expected to produce large quantities of ships, petroleum, clothes and ...arepas."

Using the book as a guide for self realization and self improvement many of our supporters have already packed their bags and planned their preferred route.\nSmall checkpoints have been set up across all cities to monitor the people journeys and verify that they are complying with the new law. Those who don't will be stripped away of their citizenship and force to leave the country.\n\nThis effort has been seen by many as a first step in liberating the people from the burden of the self imposed rules of society and as a way of reconnecting with nature and others, and, despite being enforced so strongly by the ruling goverment, the rethoric of 'It's for your own good' seems to have resonated with our people. Or maybe they are just too afraid to speak pubblicly against it. Anyhow, we could expect that both goal-driven attitude and sales of the 1929 book will skyrocket in the near future, once most of our citizens have accomplished their state-mandated journey to better themselves."

For this purpose, we summoned the politicians willing to work with us to sign the document that would install the allied government of Colombia, this treaty was written by our Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs who seems to have mistakenly written the official name of the new country as 'Columbia' instead of 'Colombia'.\n\nThe Colombians who signed the treaty did not realize the error until a few hours after the treaty was actually in place. Already politicians and revolutionaries who are against what they called 'the government at the boot of the imperialists' used our mistake as a proof of our lack of interest for the Colombian people, our government and the secretary of state justified this 'choice' of name as being 'easier to pronounce for the American people and in other languages such as Russian'.

If he declares bankruptcy and shuts down the factories under his ownership, then we will be overwhelmed with thousands of people looking for new jobs. We could possibly try to limit or even prevent this threat by subsidizing his company, though this will definitely make our government's own pockets a little lighter for a while. On the other hand, our fellow correspondance from Canada has once again approached us having heard of this matter, and wishes to buy the company on behalf of the Canadian government, which may definitely relieve us of the issue."

## Leaders ##
POLITICS_COL_PUMAREJO_DESC: "Alfonso López Pumarejo began his rapid rise in politics in 1915, working as a journalist for one of the biggest liberal newspapers of Colombia and as a local representative in the department where he was born, Tolima. His firm stance against the conservative elite and his noteworthy ability to make friends with almost anybody quickly gained him the sympathy and the trust of the public and of many fellow politicians, leading to his election to the Chamber of Representatives in 1925. After a long hegemony by the Conservative Party, the Liberals finally managed to get their candidate Enrique Olaya Herrera elected, however he retained his position for just two years, until the southern neighbor Peru started a border conflict in the Amazonas. Herrera stept down and a militaty junta took control of the situation. The war was eventually lost and because the conservatives had taken side with the military, the electorate rewarded the liberals in the next election that saw Pumarejo himself becoming the 19th president of Colombia. His first measures in the office were the expansion of welfare, scholastic reforms, investments in infrastructure and a reform of the 1886 constitution, but increasing sentiments of conservative nationalism and the rethoric of syndicalist, who blaimed the Liberals and the Junta for the war, forced the president to resign from office.\nLópez Pumarejo, a man of strong will, did not however lose his desire to lead the nation into a better future, as soon as the situation permitted so, he managed to get re-elected to continue what he dubbed 'The March Forward'. With the nation on his knees many look at him as the only one able to let it stand up again."
POLITICS_COL_MONTEJO_DESC: "Eduardo Santos Montejo graduated from Colombia's most prestigious law school and immediately began to work as a journalist for 'El Tiempo', a newspaper that in 1913 he bought out and directed with huge success. He then became the campaign manager for the successful 1930 presidential election of liberal candidate Enrique Olaya Herrera. This accomplishment granted him the friendship of the future president Alfonso López Pumarejo and a position as minister of Foreign Affairs for one year, before being moved to the position of governor of Santander in 1931 and eventually, after the war with Peru, when Pumarejo became president, Montejo became his closest adviser. Despite his many personal achievements, his critics still suggest his moderate positions are representative of his inability to take a firm stance on important issues and his rise to power doesn't represent a real democratic alternative to the rising right-wing coalition."
POLITICS_COL_COUNCIL_DESC: "A council of ministers and military personnel lead by a congressional appointee is provisionally replacing the democratically elected government and carrying out the regular functions of administration and security keeping until the president can return to his duties."
POLITICS_COL_PEREZ_DESC: "Luis Mariano Ospina Pérez's parents were both members of the traditional Colombian political families. His grandfather was president of Colombia between 1857 and 1861. Mariano graduated from the 'Escuela de Minas de Antioquia' as a Mining Engineer and began traveling abroad for two years taking courses on gold mining, sugar cane production, economics and labor relations. Upon his return in 1914, Ospina contacted the leadership of the Conservative Party and was nominated to run for the office of counselor to the City Council of Medellín. He was elected and eventually ran again, successfully, in 1917. Luck was on his side in 1922 when his uncle Pedro Nel Ospina was elected president and helped him become senator for a four-year term. Then, in 1926 he got appointed as Minister of Public Works but only remained in office for eight months, until 1927. That year, Ospina became the first president and the first registered member of the 'Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia'. Because of his high profile and connections within business circles, he eventually managed to become the new official candidate for the presidency of the Conservative Party. Strongly believing in God and Christian values but also in the importance of democracy he is seen as a more moderate candidate compared to the ex-conservative senator Laureano Gómez Castro."
POLITICS_COL_ACEVEDO_DESC: "Efrain Rojas Acevedo entered the Cadets Military School with the rank of Second Lieutenant on February 22, 1902. During his military career he worked as Military Aviation Section Chief in the War Ministry, Superior Commandant of the Air Forces in Amazonas during the conflict with Peru, military attaché in Brazil, Army Second Brigade Commandant, Military Forces General Inspector and as the War Ministry’s General Secretary. He began to take an interest in politics following the split in the leadership of the Conservative Party, when Laureano Gómez Castro abandoned the party and formed the Chulavita movement. Rapidly gaining the trust of many ex-officials and business personalities as a staunch moderate and traditionalist inside the military apparatus, he became from 1938 on a prime candidate to replace Mariano Ospina Pérez. Acevedo himself assured that he would accept the role and leave his military career, in the hopes of assuring peace and open dialogue with the opposition. He, in fact, strongly believes that a \"non aggression pact\" with both revolutionaries and reactionary elements is not only possible but should also be the government’s first priority in the short term. However, many highly respected officials, including Rojas Pinilla, openly call him \"a traitor\" for his open desire to negotiate with the socialists."
POLITICS_COL_GAITAN_DESC: "Jorge Eliécer Gaitán was born and spent his early years in a poor neighborhood in the center of Bogotá called Egipto where he was exposed to rampant poverty and violence. Although he was raised under such an unfortunate environment, his parents were white-collar workers and held rank-and-file positions in the Liberal Party. His interest in politics sparked during his high school years and once enrolled in the National University in Bogotá where he studied law, Gaitán founded the University Center of Cultural Propaganda and organized a massive protest movement against president Marco Fidel Suárez. This caught the interest of many within the Liberal Party, who invited him to join them. He further increased his nationwide popularity supporting the banana workers' strike in Magdalena in 1928. When strikers were fired upon by the army on the orders of the United Fruit Company, resulting in numerous deaths, Gaitán used his skills as a lawyer in order to defend workers' rights and called for accountability to those involved in the massacre. In 1933, he created the Unión Nacional Izquierdista Revolucionaria, or UNIR, as his own dissident political movement after breaking with the Liberal Party with the aim of uniting all left wing revolutionary movements under one big tent. It is said that Gaitán's main political asset is his profound and vibrant oratory skills that makes him arguably Colombia's most influential political figure of our time."
POLITICS_COL_LUIS_CORDOBA_DESC: "Diego Luis Córdoba has always represented a figure to look up to for both blacks in Colombia and the people of Chocò, the largely overlooked departement near the Darien Gap where he was born. As a young man he make himself known inside the student movement linked to the Liberal Party and secured a friendship with Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, but their view would eventually diverge, expecially on matters of international politics. Córdoba, had the opportunity in 1925 to visit his friend and painter Nel Gómez Agudelo, who was responsable for starting the Colombian Muralist Movement alongside fellow painter Santiago Martinez Delgado, in the Socialist Republic of Italy in 1925 where he was experimenting new art forms, there they met his Gómez Agudelo's future wife Giuliana Scalaberni who introduced him to the italian syndicalist leaders Giuseppe Di Vittorio and Palmiro Togliatti. It is said Luis Córdoba life changed that day. He briefly joined the Unione Sindacalista during this time and started to embrace the political views of european syndicalists. In 1927, Luis Córdoba returned home and started advocating for the Internationale, founding the Partido Síndicalista Colombiano, a new political movement with strong ties to his mentors' ideas on national unions and internationalism, adding his personal views on afrocolombian unity and bringing about a new era of equality and dialogue between the various ethinicies present in the colombian society."
POLITICS_COL_VIEIRA_DESC: "Gilberto Vieira White joined the Partido Totalista Obrero in 1930 when the party was only a few months old and built himself a reputation as the most inflexible maximalist in the country's political landscape. In 1933, Vieira White brought order to the disorganized PTO, establishing a number of cadres which implemented a system of directors running operations over the masses. This new level of organization brought some electoral success to the party and the next year Vieira White was elected to the House of Representatives for Cundinamarca. Due to the failure of the polices of his predicessor, focused on following north american ideals of collaboration with the other socialist parties, he eventually assumed leadership of the PTO during a very agitated party congress in Bucaramanga where the then secretary-general Augusto Durán handed in his resignation only a few years after his nomination to the position. Following Durán’s resignation and the ensuing power vacuum that formed, Vieira White launched a massive campaign to reshape the party in his image and ideals, adopting many of Oswald Mosely and Benito Mussolini's ideas on what Totalism should look like, adapted for the Colombian situation."
POLITICS_COL_GOMEZ_CASTRO_DESC: "Laureano Eleuterio Gómez Castro was raised by a Christian fundamentalist family, studied in a Jesuit school from a young age and graduated as an engineer in 1909. Shortly after, Gómez founded the newspaper 'La Unidad', which he later proudly defined as 'the official voice of the priests of Colombia', and joined the Conservative Party. He was then named ambassador to Argentina and was later elected as a senator.\nAlways pushing for a more Catholic integralist agenda, Gómez Castro began working closely alongside the National Populist group Los Leopardos, whom he traveled with on a tour of Europe in order to study ways to implement their common nationalistic goals for Colombia. Returning home from his tour of Europe, Gómez Castro came into conflict with his own party because of the moderate tones the party used against their liberal opponents and the lack address to the threat the new left lead by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán posed to the nation, so he went his way and formed a new movement called Los Chulavitas. Their membership demands absolute trust in the good judgment of their leader and absolute dedication to the Catholic faith, whose values are to be applied to all aspects of life."
POLITICS_COL_PINILLA_DESC: "Born in the town of Tunja, in the department of Boyacá, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla developed a great interest in the lives of Simon Bolívar and Gen.Santander from early in his life. The youngest of five brothers in a very conservative family, his father was also a military man who fought in the civil war of 1899-1903. For his part, Rojas Pinilla enrolled in the military in 1920. Rojas Pinilla’s family connections allowed him to begin his military service as a Captain but later on, during war against Peru, his bravery and valor in the field of battle earned him the \"Orden de Boyacá\", the highest accolade in Colombia's military. When the war was lost most generals found themselves under attack, but not Rojas Pinilla, being one of the few to have successfuly halted the devastating advance of the peruvian forces and the only one who actually menaged to make some gains. Because of an overall shortage of high commanders and because of the notoriety he developed after being given the 'Orden de Boyacá', he quickly climbed the ranks and was eventually promoted to the rank of Major General in 1935, since no other candidate was available. He has, since then, assembled a small clandestine group of closely trusted officials under his command, named Movimiento Patria Unida.\nAccording to some, Rojas Pinilla has become convinced that he will become immortal in the memory of Colombia. However, whether he manages to achieve such fame and how he plans to do so remains to be seen."
POLITICS_COL_ARANGO_RAMOS_DESC: "Not much is known about the infancy and early years of Elíseo Arango Ramos, only that he was born in Bagadó, a small and very poor city in the department of Chocó. He studied law and founded a group of students named Los Leopardos, which sought to bring more young people to the Conservative Party and renew the nation with a new vitality based upon the principles of conservatism and nationalism. From early on, he took interest in esoteric studies which his fellow Leopardos followed along with. His research led him to shape a new type of political theory based on race, traditionalism and national unity which he called \"El Camino Nacionalista\" (The Nacionalist Path). In 1920, he invited the very popular conservative senator Gómez Castro to one of his research meetings and impressed him so much the two of them began forming a strong friendship that eventually led to them travelling to Europe togheter. Above all else, Arango Ramos has been known for his fierce pride for his home department, a territory most often overlooked by the central government. This built him a reputation as he pushed for more spending for Chocó, but mostly his calls fell upon deaf ears. Gaitán and his allies were convinced this would have keep happening, but Arango Ramos is now in a position of strong power and ready to act."
POLITICS_COL_CANO_DESC: "María de los Ángeles Cano Márquez is mostly known for being one of the founders of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the forerunner of the UTC, and for obtaining the honorific title given to prominent charity workers, \"Labor Flower of Medellin\". Having been raised by progressives parents and despite being unable to attend university as women were still not permitted to attend, Cano developed a great interest in politics and writing. In 1926, she was granted the responsibility of organising Antioquia's representation at the 'Third Labor Congress' and married Ignacio Torres Giraldo, a prominent socialist leader. Together, they helped found the SRP. Despite being labelled by conservatives as 'just a rebellious woman', Cano has always been present along with her husband to defend the working class people of Colombia and its many minorities. She gained further nationwide prominence after managing to pressure the government to free the indigenous leader Manuel Quintín Lame, who was detained for trying to establish a self-proclaimed Republic of Indigenas in Cauca and its surrounding territories. Cano retired from public life in 1928, following her imprisonment for leading efforts to organize the strike that led to the Bananeras Massacre. However, the ongoing conflict splitting the country has thrust Cano back into the political sphere and reignited her commitment to lead women and all those oppressed by the status quo."

### Ideas ###
COL_lost_war: "Quenched Pride"
COL_lost_war_desc: "Despite ideological differences the people of Colombia are united in their desire to regain their lost pride. Movements of citizens lobbying for revenge against Peru are arising all around the country in an effort to push the goverment into revanchism. Their plea is currently falling into deaf ears as many politicians in Bogota are much more worried by the troubling internal situation to preoccupy themselves with waging another costly war against those who are been dubbed Colombia's 'eternal enemies'."
COL_factionalized_army: "Factionalized Army"
COL_factionalized_army_desc: "Since the war with Peru, Colombia's armed forces have become strongly divided politically. While the a few top generals are orbiting around Field Marshal Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, others feel like the Caudillo should didn't diserve his post, that previously was occupied by much more respected war heroes, and they instead support the ex-conservative Gomez Castro and his christian message, meanwhile many of the privates and lower ranking officers are in favour of a more hands-off approach or even openly oppose their superiors. As a whole, the military apparatus is unconvinced about the competence and leadership of Rojas Pinilla. He has much to prove, and many consider the Marshal incapable of leading a stabilized Colombia. This attitude is reflected in the general state of our army, which is greatly disorganized and unprepared for battle."

With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."

COL_licenses_from_GER_both: "Ties with Germany"
COL_licenses_from_GER_both_desc: "Field Marshal Gustavo Rojas Pinilla has successfully petitioned for the support of the German Empire. After a successful meeting with the Kaiser's diplomats, new economic and military agreements have been set in stone between our two nations, and German companies and weapon licenses have begun to be contracted within our nation's factories. With the support of the world's finest fighting force, our military's capabilities have grown extensively."
COL_tradecongress: "Congreso de Sindicatos Colombianos"
COL_tradecongress_desc: "The 'Congress of Colombian Syndicates,' a union assembly, has been founded, drawing inspiration from European syndicalist nations such as the Commune of France and the Union of Britain. Although the European Syndicalism model might not perfectly align with our economic situation, it has demonstrated success thus far. Our populace is reaping the benefits of newfound political freedom, and this surge in morale is aiding the introduction of our fresh economic system and contributing to a modest increase in industrial output."
COL_armedminorities: "Armed Minorities"
COL_armedminorities_desc: "All Colombian peoples have a right to preserve their own dignity. Indigenous people and Afro-Colombians, among other minorities, often had to struggle to survive under the yoke of capitalism. Many times their livelihoods were destroyed in the name of 'profit'. Now the time has come to let their voices be heard and help us build a new society based on equality and participation by having the various formerly oppressed minority groups join our armed forces in order to help us defend their rights. We are not a nation of one people, and this fact makes us stronger."

COL_antisocialist_trade_idea_1: "Well Oiled Political Machine"
COL_socialisteconomy_desc: "As part of our new benevolent rule, a new economic system is put in place, as it has already been done in other parts of the world. The end goal is for the means of production to be held by the workers, but at the moment the effort is concentrated primarily on securing economic independence from foreign capital, which has proven difficult because of the capitalistic pigs in our vicinities. This radical shift will prove to be difficult to implement, but Colombia has previously shown that it is ready to deal with difficult situations such as this. It is only a matter of time before the growing pains subside."
COL_industrialist_protest: "Industrialists Protest"
COL_industrialist_protest_desc: "Remnants of the Old Colombia still resist our rightful rule. The industrialists are protesting the implementation of new measures proposed by the Revolutionary Congress to empower labor unions and redistribute wealth. This is having terrible effects on our economy, as factories are closing en masse in a misguided attempt to stop the socialist forces or at least to force concessions from them. We must act before the masses of unemployed turn on us in an unjust rage."

COL_industrialist_protest_crushed_desc: "The worst has come to an end. The industrialists protested the implementation of new measures proposed by the Revolutionary Congress to empower labor unions and redistribute wealth, closing factories and shops en masse in attempt to stop the socialist forces or at least to force concessions from them. The governament has responded rapidly and with force, dispersing the crowd and forcing the strikers to reopen their workplaces, one way of another."
COL_political_turmoil: "Political Turmoil"
COL_political_turmoil_desc: "In a country where the two party system has always been the norm, the recent birth of minor parties led by ex-members of the Liberal and Conservative parties has moved the country’s political discourse to the extremes. Frequent episodes of violence have emerged in all of Colombia, especially in the zones furthest from the capital, where the state's grip is weakest. Many political analysts predict that at this rate we will have serious trouble to deal with in the next few years, and politically-motivated violence may become the norm."

COL_reform_mil_academies: "Reformed Military Academies"
COL_reform_mil_academies_desc: "As Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla and other high ranking army leaders demanded, the reformation of military academies is intended to assure the loyalty of the cadets and eliminate any risk of having soldiers secretly siding with the socialists and other insurgent elements. This of course will increase the amount of time needed to train new recruits as we ensure their loyalty to the cause, but won’t really provide much in terms of extra combat readiness for our troops."

A Temporary Council lead by one appointee chosen by the Congress has been formed to substitute him since the vice-presidency has been abolished by the 1910 constitutional reforms. Although the Council is trying their best to keep the public morale up and the cities safe in this difficult moment, many are seizing the opportunity to protest the legitimacy of the government and its recent policies."

To remedy this, let's enact legislation to protect the reputation of our soldiers and shift accountability towards the true culprits: the ineffective social democrat politicians.

Turns out as soon as the land was brought by his son the president signed a decree to make a speedway pass throu it, with the intent of making the value of the land raise exponentially. And that but only one of the times Lopez Pumarejo used his power for his own gain.

We, in the meanwhile, will seek to make amends with the Liberals, positioning ourselves to secure victory in the elections."
COL_approach_the_liberals: "Approach the Liberal Party"
COL_approach_the_liberals_desc: "Since the Liberal Party's decline post-Olaya Herrera's failed reforms and resignation amid Peru tensions, it's now a fading force. Progressive voters seek alternatives like our centrist position or the UNIR movement. Some consider the Partido Conservador, Leopardos, or Chulavitas. Realizing the need for unity to usher in a new era of peace, our administration sees the potential for a union between APEN and the Partido Liberal. With the Partido Conservador excluding us from their government plans, discussions will be initiated to unite the two parties. This aligns with the left side of our party's longstanding suggestion as the best solution, eliminating the risk of the treacherous conservatives or even the socialists surpassing us in the next election."

COL_a_more_inclusive_country_desc: "The Conservative Party always looked at Blacks with distain. We should secure the support of blacks as they are fundamental for developing our coastal cities and securing our naval output. While a small but very vocal minority of Afrodescendents are in fact liberal or socialist leaning, a majority of them are devout catholics, as statistics about conversatorism in the Atlantic Coast clearly show, the only problem is that up until now they never found any party representing them on the right. We will be those representetives."

To the near North-West there is the Darien Jungle, near Panama, to the East there are large swath of abandoned land near our borders with Venezuela and of course the large Amazon Jungle, all the perfect areas to fund and train foreign militias far from indescreet eyes. As such a new opportunity arises: to set up a private training zone open to all socialists volunteers from across the continent.

While much must be done to undo the damages caused by the Leopardos, Gonzalez has his own plans for the future of our state. Proclaiming the need to increase the separation of Church and State, Gonzalez himself is seemingly pushing for a 'Colombian Esotericism,' a highly individualistic and heterodox interpretation of Christianity. Also supportive of Latino Supremacy, while pushing for a complete dismantling our own history.

While their attempts have failed, the laws and programs to attract Aryans remain in place, with a small influx continuing. This calls for action! These laws must be abolished, and Aryans should be encouraged to marry into our race and have mixed children or leave the country. Huge cash invectives shall be given to those of Latino birth who pair with these two people groups. While it will no doubt take generations, in time Colombia shall be wholly Mixed Latinos, and the greatest Race shall have a land to call home."

Our past is intricately linked to the arrival of the Spanish and Europeans, who propagated myths of their superiority. These narratives fueled beliefs like those of the Leopardos, who saw increased immigration as a remedy. This cycle must end. To eradicate this inferiority complex at its core, we must take decisive action. Banning history education and disposing of historical texts will allow us to envision a brighter future free from the shackles of a shameful past."

COL_esotericism_desc: "Perhaps one of the few thing the Leopardos actually got right was their policy of separation of Church and State. However this policy simple ended with the creation of a secular state, which while a good start, is not far enough. True Christianity is not professed by the Roman Catholic Church or any organized religion. No, Christ's message one was of internal growth and understanding of the light that is within us and within all things. By this logic, Christian Corporations shall also be made to accept workers of all creeds as long as their inner lights shine bright in their hearts, by force if necessary. By pushing and adopting this, the true meaning and understanding of Christ's Truth, we can begin to finally drag our nation into the modern age.

As an initial step toward the abolishment of every form of government in our mighty nation of equals, we shall rewrite the constitution, entrusting the leadership of the country to a Supreme Leader rather than a President. The role of this figure will be singular: safeguarding the anarchist state from reactionary forces seeking to resurrect the old, corrupt democracy. This Supreme Leader will possess limitless power to act decisively in defense of our cause. Ultimately, as time progresses, the need for the position of Supreme Leader will naturally diminish, and the leader will choose to abolish it."

The regime in Quito is eternally unstable and doing away with the nation's fractious and tiny army will be a breeze. However, there are suggestions which would get us the land with zero loss. Backdoor discussions between Ecuadorian officials and our diplomats have revealed that the current administration feels very threatened by Peru. If we were to guarantee its borders, then Quito would bow to Bogata. We won't even have to waste time putting down their useless resistance."

For too long our mining sector has sagged, and lagged far behind the rest of the world, and, in consequence, has left our nation poorer than it should be. To remedy this the Government has put in orders for the most advanced mining machinery in the world and has begun courting Peruvians foreign mining engineers to help get to deposits some thought impossible.

### General Events ###
col.1.t: "Colombia's place in the world"
col.1.d: "Politics in our country were never stable.\nIn 1928, amid ongoing civil unrest and strikes, tensions erupted when the conservative government sanctioned the massacre of banana workers near Santa Marta at the behest of the United Fruit Company. Estimates on casualties ranged from 47 to as high as 2000. Public outcry ensued and a then-fringe faction lead by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán managed to swing the congress into curtailing military power and punishing those responsible for the 'Bananeras Massacre'.\nHaving lost support in the congress the conservatives ceded power to the liberals.\n\nJust three years later a dispute over territory in the Amazon rainforest and control of the economically strategic Rio Putumayo escalated into a regional conflict with Peruvian forces, leading to formal war. An emergency military junta was hastily formed to manage the crisis.\nThe war lasted one and a half years before a miscalculated intervention by Ecuador, who were given a provocatory ultimatum by Peru, opened a new frontline in Guayaquil and the surrounding areas. The army's disastrous state after the 1928 scandal allowed Peru to conquer Ecuadorian territories and push directly into our heartland, resulting in a humiliating treaty that required us to cede a significant portion of our south-eastern Amazonas region.\n\nOnce again, the army fell out of favor and a large majority of the colombian people, dissatisfied with the poor handeling of the war crisis by both historical party, demanded changes.\nThe socialist formed UNIR, a coalition of all socialist parties, while moderate liberals and fringe nationalists orchestrated the birth of a new party, APEN, essentially centrist in nature but that could function as a catch-all party. Shortly its creation, APEN had already being assigned the post of leading the country, with the promise of working once more to heal Colombia's wounds..."

col.2.t: "Rojas Pinilla Returns from Germany"
col.2.d: "Last night Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla landed safely in Bogotá after his time abroad in Germany, and with good news. Having been sent as an unofficial ambassador and attaché as a sign of respect between our nations, as well as to secure an official arms deal with the Kaiserreich that would see us buy ammunition, aircrafts, and naval designs; it is now safe to say that the meeting was a success, and we can expect the first wave of supplies to arrive soon. Rojas Pinilla, in a report to the press, had stated that he was impressed by the advancements that the Germans had achieved, and was sure that a greater economic link would only benefit Colombia in the long run."
col.2.a: "Welcome back."

col.3.t: "Black Monday is a disaster for the Colombian economy"
col.3.d: "In the wake of the sudden crash of the German stock market, numerous nations, Colombia included, find themselves navigating treacherous economic waters. Prominent economists are issuing dire forecasts, warning that without swift and robust industrialization, coupled with a significant pivot in economic policy, the future for the Colombian people could become desperate.\n\nThis bleak outlook has already led to a mass exodus of foreign investors from the country, casting a shadow over the global economic landscape and pushing the world closer to the precipice of potential collapse."
col.3.a: "We should pray for Colombia's salvation."

col.4.t: "Violence erupts!"
col.4.d: "Heated political discussion between Colombia's left and right wing parties has been a staple of our country for a long time. Many older people still remember our last civil war, while many in the younger generation find themselves without a father or a grandad.\nRecently, with the devastating and inevitable crash of the Berlin Stock Exchange, the economic crisis that ensued and shook our country left our citizens enraged and in despair, resorting to the long established colombian tradition of turning against in rage. While this new wave of violence is currently limited to coastal cities, there's a looming threat of it spreading to our capital and other major urban centers.\nMeanwhile, although the army has been deployed to maintain order, certain elements within the army are fanning the flames of hate against UNIR voters.\n\nThe situation is getting increasingly desperate with every hour that passes. No less desperate is the state of our army, which is underequipped and filled with subversive elements. Should we trust Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla and his men or should we, rather, maintain our diplomatic attitude?\nActually... there could be another solution. Following the Chulavitas' example, we could establish a self-defense force, empowering our people to protect their families and country."

In Bogotá an attempt was made to kill the leader of the UNIR leader Gaitán earlier this morning, but the politician has managed to miraculously survive the assasination. An enraged mob of people sympathetic to Gaitán pursued the shooter and lynched him to death. His body disappeared and along with it, his identity and motive remain unknown.\n\nMany theories have sprung up about who the killer was and how he got so close to his elusive target. The Leopardos claim the shooter was a Chulavitas, members of the military pin him to a rogue totalist militia disatisfied with his big tent approach and some even say it was our doing!\nThis incident has led to massive disorder and renewed fighting in the streets. Buses have been set on fire, shops looted and destroyed, and police vehicles stolen. Chaos has sunk its claws deep into our nation. The violence has also crept into the countryside where the situation was just as tense, blowing the lid off of years of simmering tensions The nation is descending into anarchy and while many anarchists and criminals prowl the streets many more God fearing Colombians bar their doors closed and pray for the violence to end soon, one way or another."
col.5.d_2: "In spite of, or maybe because of, our caution in dealing with the militia and the Socialist allies, violence now grips the cities of Cali, Medellín and Bogotá. In Bogotá a gunman tried to kill the leader of the UNIR leader Gaitán earlier today while he was about to attend a regular morning congress session, but the politician has managed to miraculously survive the assasination. An enraged mob of people sympathetic to Gaitán pursued the shooter and lynched him to death. His body disappeared and along with it, his identity and motive remain unknown.\n\nIn the place of an official motive many theories have arisen. Some blame military members associated with the Chulavitas, others chalk it up to a rogue totalist militia disatisfied with his big tent approach and some even say it was our fault despite the fact we are trying to keep the peace! The attempt has only fed into the chaos and fighting on the streets. Buses have been set on fire, shops looted and destroyed, and police vehicles stolen. Chaos has sunk its claws deep into our nation. The violence has also crept into the countryside where the situation was just as tense, blowing the lid off of years of simmering tensions The nation is descending into anarchy and while many anarchists and criminals prowl the streets many more God fearing Colombians bar their doors closed and pray for the violence to end soon, one way or another."

col.6.t: "Troubles in Bucaramanga"
col.6.d: "Following our administration's decision to organize our own paramilitary force - the Cachiporros - all seemed to be going according to our plans. That was, however, until the assassination attempt on Socialist firebrand Jorge Eliécer Gaitán - an enemy of our democracy, but beloved by a small, fanatic minority within our electoral base. It seems some of our Cachiporros did not get the memo to not throw in with the socialists of Gaitán - the greater of two evils - over the Chulavitas, that as just as bad but that are not at this moment our primary objective, for that hitting them helps the 'comrades' more then it helps our democracy. What can we expect from our radical base, mostly illiterate farmers? They may not realize the political shift; Gaitán is no longer their 'friend,' if he ever was, he's solely focused on his dream of a totalitarian state.\nRegardless, some Cachiporros loyal to his image have spiraled out of control and into mayhem as they take justice and retribution into their own hands; these kind of violent episodes have come to a gruesome head in the city of Bucaramanga.\n\nA known conservative stronghold, Bucaramanga is a central base of operations for the Chulavitas - a fact our Cachiporros know all too well. Marching 'the petrolium city' with machetes and rifles drawn, our Cachiporros began to mercilessly cut down any random citizen - both militant and civilian - that crossed their path in brutal fashion. With a hack off a limb here and a shot through the head there, our bloodthirsty troops ravaged the zone like a pack of wild, savage beasts. The violence escalated when police forces intervened, resulting in the deaths of two officers.\nTaking advantage of the brief lapse in enemy fire, some of our forces fled to a nearby ranch to hide out. However, when they arrived, they found the ranch occupied by the family who worked it, and instead of simply letting them go, our paramilitary troops made the situation even worse by taking the married couple and their four children hostage."
col.6.a: "Call the police immediatly! Call the army, also! Whatever it takes..."
col.6.b: "Making this public is too dangerous. Let the Cachiporros disappear into the night."

col.7.t: "The Hostage Situation Turns Ugly"
col.7.d: "Last night, as soon as the hostage situation was given in the capable hand of the police and the local army garrison, the law officers decided to send in their elite special forces squad to deal with the delicate turn of events, but on this bloody day, even hostage negotiations were doomed to fail.\nUpon hearing a loud 'bang' from inside the hideout, the police commander ordered every one of his officers to fire upon the building. In a cacophony of splintering wood, singed materials from the heat of gun brass, and with crimson blood flying through the air, the lives of all inside - both combatant and hostage - were erased in one violent instant. \n\nAs tragic of an incident as this 'Massacre of Bucaramanga' has become, the reverberations it has caused are of an even greater magnitude. People across the nation are demanding an explanation as to how so many innocent lives were so callously thrown away. Our former-allies among the Conservatives and Liberals now call for our resignation. Even our armed forces are enraged over the incident, shaming us for using unproven and wild paramilitaries instead of relying on them.\n\nWith former allies turning foes, our administration faces limited options. We can either attempt to diplomatically approach this mess, reaching out to the army, and to Laureano Gómez Castro in order to keep the peace, or we can simply deny all responsibility and blame the whole thing on independently acting paramilitary commanders. However, it is not likely the rest of the nation will buy this excuse. What shall we do?"
col.7.a: "Deny any and all involvement! The Cachiporros acted alone and without guidance."
col.7.b: "Own up to our grievous mistake and attempt to reconcile with those we have offended."

col.8.t: "A Win For The Army"
col.8.d: "Minutes into the protest, a swift army intervention, using tear gas and bullets, restored peace in the center of Bogotá. The soldiers then moved to the Barrios Unidos and Egipto districts, where it was believed militia leaders were directing their irregulars, and both districts were secured within thirty minutes or so.\n\nHowever, this is far from the end of our difficulties. Rojas Pinilla himself advised following this first action with a decisive blow to come tomorrow, implying that acting later than this date would render the entire operation futile.\nThe plan is for the army to work with the police to block all major city entry points and to conduct massive searches in the homes and vehicles of politically active citizens. He then assured that this will not escalate further, limiting our people's God-given rights, but will only be the necessary actions to ensure that peace is maintained within our borders.\n\nAs promising as this plan may appear at first glance, we must also consider the number of claims of misbehavior and simply stupid initiatives carried out by our troops during today's intervention, with the total number of casualties far exceeding what our chief strategist anticipated.\nOne example is already spreading through word of mouth. One colonel and his soldiers stormed into a Carrera 7 pub and demanded that all bottles of beer be handed over to him. They started drinking and when they were completely wasted, they demanded to play Tejo. As we all very well know Tejo is a very dangerous party game to play while drunk because it involves throwing small explosives into small holes, but it becomes even more dangerous if you decide to throw your hand grenade instead of the standard equipment.\nIf this was an isolated incident, there would be no reason to be concerned, but it appears that not all stories are as colorful as this one, and allowing the army to do whatever they want could pose a very real danger."
col.8.a: "Who can we trust if not the Army? Let them carry out the plan."
col.8.b: "I think that what we did is already enough."

col.9.t: "It's 1928 All Over Again"
col.9.d: "Today, two distinct scenes were demonstrated, both of which piqued our people's interest and exposed the cracks that are engreined in our society. The first occurred in the streets in front of a very old and dilapidated building in the Chapinero neighborhood. Two people, a man and a woman, screamed and shouted as their son is thrown into the back trunk of a military vehicle, as were hundreds or even thousands more in other streets and districts throughout Bogotá. Sedition is the same verdict for all of them. They all have the same judge and jury: the soldiers carrying out the largest anti-rebellion operation in our country's history...\nMany of these arrests are being carried out based on little to no evidence,\n\nThe second scene occurred in parliament during today's joint session. Both the right opposition stood up and screamed at the top of their lungs about the travesty of the entire affair while the left wing one began suggesting that the ministers mothers entertain patrons while the ministers fathers are not home. Someone from the Liberal Party even attempted to bring a concealed gun into Parliament, but was apprehended and arrested for sedition.\nDuring the long barrage of insults and protests, a man with a cast stood up and raised his hand, suggesting that he be allowed to speak. The speaker instinctively gave him the right in the midst of the chaos, and the entire assembly stopped screming and turned to him. It was a slightly fatigued Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, that, once given the permission, just said 'This nation deserves better than a dishonorable president letting his army play pub games with live grenades'. Some members laughed, others booed, and some even raised their hands to respond appropriately.\n\nAs the session ended and the congressmen exited the building, silence descended on the palace where once stood Simon Bolivar and all our great heroes who have since passed away."
col.9.a: "Such a gloomy day."

col.10.t: "UNIR Protests Military Actions with a Silent March"
col.10.d: "UNIR's leader, Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, orchestrated today a 'Silent March' in Bogotá with support from Syndicalist and Totalist factions. Approximately a hundred thousand participants are participating alongside the organizers, utilizing absolute silence from all of the demonstrators to denounce the recent episodes of violence that have shaken the country. Gaitán has used the march to call for an end to the government's use of the police and military forces to repress political opposition and invites us to confront the issue in a more civil and constitutional manner.\nAs boots unceremoniously meet the cobbled roads of the city, there is no chanting or screaming, only silence. Although today's protest has thus far proceeded without incident, another protest is already scheduled for next Sunday in Manizales, with another in Villavicencio in the works.\n\nIronically, on the other side of Colombia, the same people advocating for a peaceful solution to our country's problems defile it with violence and brutality. The militias run amok in the countryside. Our administration hears nothing but horror stories from those who cross paths with these masked raiders - tales of looting, pillaging, and absolute savagery are widespread.\nOne man even tells his own tale of the socialist's brutality: upon being captured and his conservative ideals being revealed, the militia used him to bait his family into emerging from their hiding spots around the surrounding property. Upon capturing the entire family, the man was forced to watch as soldiers asked his brother if he wanted to 'race' or be shot. The man chose the former and four soldiers simultaneously held him down, doused him with fuel, and set him ablaze, watching carefully as he fled down the street eventually falling down a cliff.\nWhile the survivor looked on in abject terror, these terrorists laughed while others grumbled, upset at their lost bet.\n\nDespite the peaceful veneer Gaitán attempts, officials in the army urge us to end the charade, fearing a slip in national security.\nShould we grant authorization for the army to use force if protestors don't comply?"
col.10.a: "Violence begets violence. Send in the army!"
col.10.b: "Bring Gaitán to the table. If he truly belives in peace we can have a ... truce."

col.11.t: "Desperate Times, Desperate Measures"
col.11.d_1: "The terrorists based in Bucaramanca must be patting themselves on the back pretty hard to have pulled their little stunt so easily. They are seemingly oblivious to the fact we let them get away with it. Our inaction has gained quite a bit more attention than we hoped and already reporters are printing incendiary columns damning our administration. Our people. Those who can read at least, are outraged. Reports are filtering in that public opinion is careening through the floor and could spill over into outright violence if nothing is done soon. We must do something that draws the spotlight away from us!\n\nThankfully we have already gotten a plan, a staged kidnapping 'planned' by Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla. First we must find someone who hates Rojas Pinilla. That is probably the easiest part of the plan since Rojas Pinilla is so grating he could make Jesus strangle him.

Of course its simply a magical coincidence that our protege Bonito Vega will lead the court and the jury will be stacked with government loyalists.\n\nIn fact, it worked better than we could've hoped for. Many of Rojas Pinilla's allies who we expected to have to neutralize have come out against him with some very colorful language. They are making sure to burn their bridges with him down to the foundations. All of these men who once openly talked of Rojas Pinilla as a future dictator, now can barely stomach to say his name. These same officers have now begun to flock to our clique in droves, shoring up our once sagging power base and securing the President's position.

Chief among the claims are the de-escalation of the Bogotazo situation by freezing all army's funds, a condamnation of foreign imperialism and relieving Rojas Pinilla of his position.\n\nThey can claim otherwise, but the middle class colombian knows that what [COL.GetColombianTotLeaderFullName] and all his criminal friends want is to take power and reign supreme.

The majority of our party would be upset and the public would probably take Felix's side, but in these dire times, the might as well be too distracted to make a big deal out of it.\nThen again we could endeavor to persuade him to remain by promising a more pro-active anti-socialist stance and offering a substantial donation to his Caro y Cuervo foundation, among other concessions he may require.

However, news of this travesty has already spread like wildfire, and it has thrown many people in the cities into almost mass hysteria out of fear of yet another attack.

Obviously, this statement has garnered much praise from both like-minded sympathizers and the afrocolombians themselves, and many have seen their confidence increase as a response to the afrocolombians now becoming even more active in the politics of the country.

His loyalty and utility are unquestionable, and in his capacity as the owner of El Tiempo, the most popular centrist newspaper, he has now demonstrated his value as an effective insider for propaganda efforts.\nApparently, there is documented evidence indicating that before departing from the Conservative Party, Laureano Gomez Castro had engaged in discussions about ousting Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla from the military. Castro even reportedly proposed using covert tactics to put an end to the Marshal's career. However, that's not all!\nIt turns out that Gomez Castro wasn't always supportive of his current allies. He actively worked to undermine the possibility of the Leopardos joining the Conservative Party altogether. A reliable source closely associated with the Chulavitas leader has disclosed that Gomez Castro extensively lobbied for a veto on all Leopardos members entering the bipartisan system, adding that Gomez Castro frequently denigrated the populist group, referring to them as 'a bunch of no-brain hypocrites and lowlife scums who would serve the country better by turning a gun on themselves'.\n\nAs rumors of a coalition between Chulavitas and Leopardos rapidly circulate, a scandalous revelation like this could potentially dismantle any prospects of an alliance between them, thereby strengthening our position in the polls. However, the flip side is that without a robust opposition bloc against the socialists, this revelation could also benefit UNIR and enhance their chances of securing the presidency.\nThe question before us now is: should we give make El Tiempo publish this groundbreaking article or not?"

They present this coalition as a fresh conservative movement focused on countering socialism, reevaluating racial and purity issues, and fostering new job opportunities for the nation.\nWhat initially seemed an unlikely partnership between the Chulavitas and the Leopardos has evolved into a shared agenda, overcoming historical ideological tensions between them.\n\nA strong nationalist footprint pervades the document and openly asserts the intention to elevate Colombia's geopolitical significance, a position they assert should have been achieved already.\n\nWhile there are numerous shared values between the two parties, substantial differences could hinder the project's realization. Foremost is the religious issue: both parties agree that Colombian citizens should abide by Biblical principles, but they diverge on the role of the Christian Church in politics, weather the state should become one with the Church or if religious men should only act as 'shepards for the people'.\nAdditionaly Gomez is seen as much more pragmatic then the others, and that is saying something given the prevailing portrayal of Gomez as a hotheaded individual by Liberals and Conservatives alike."

However, recent events suggest that this prominent native leader has once again taken charge of his people.\nIt appears Lame has launched an official manifesto advocating for robust measures to safeguard the indigenous populations of the Andes.\n\nThe manifesto centers around the core principle of indigenous self-governance and complete autonomy within historically and culturally significant ancestral areas. These areas include, but are not confined to, Zipaquirá (near Bogotá), substantial regions in the Cauca department, the Guajira, and the Sierra Nevada in the Caribbean region. Additionally, the manifesto proposes the establishment of a new governmental oversight agency empowered to veto any government actions targeting these regions and composed entirely of ethnically indigenous people.\n\nLame also conveyed to journalists his willingness to collaborate with Gaitán and his coalition, provided they commit to upholding the manifesto's tenets. This alignment isn't unexpected, as Lame has a longstanding history of working closely with syndicalist activists — many of whom are still active within certain factions, and some of whom are likely to become ministers should UNIR win the election.\nHowever, Lame pointed out that despite Gaitán's public discourse on indigenous rights, he has yet to engage in direct dialogue with any native leaders, including Quintin himself. Consequently, Lame remains uncertain about whether the largely underrepresented indigenous people of Colombia can genuinely place their trust in Gaitán.\n\nWhile they haven't made any request to us to implement these demands yet, their political intentions are now clearer than before."

In other words, because of their numbers, we should be both vigilant and careful about the possibility of a radical Afrocolombians uprising if, God knows how, they manage to swing the rest of their ethnic group against the democratic institutions and support UNIR and their wicked plans instead.\nThat is implying that UNIR itself is not behind this sudden surge of awareness, which most probably is the case.\n\nAt this moment the situation is still under control but it has been suggested we should act to put an end to this just in case."

The victim of this story was one of those under surveillance.\nUnder direct orders from high-ranking generals, the army proceeded to eliminate the perceived threats, but in the case of Diego Nunez Castillo, they tragically exceeded all bounds. Not only did they end his life within the confines of a church, but according to a classified document, they also subjected him to immense suffering before taking his life.\n\nAt this time the information is still evades the press and the general public, but soon enough if action is not taken people will find out the truth. We received Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla in our offices to answer of the fact and, opposite of what we thought it would happen, his arrogant demeanor was nowhere to be found in this occasion. The deeply concerned general expressed sorrow and an apparent sense of shame for his men's actions.\nNonetheless, he urged the government to keep the truth concealed for the public's sake.\n\nThere is also a strong case of making Nunez Castillo a national hero and declare he died for his country, in case we want to make Laureano Gomez Castro and his Chulavitas more combactive and liked by the people, and God knows they need that more than ever with the recent polls seeing a rapid increase in popularity of Gaitan and his associates."

Bus driver Gonzalo Castillo has placed so many sacred images on his bus that he has effectively blocked all windows, not permitting any light to come through it.\nAs any Colombian of goodwill and strong inventive mind would do, he found a solution by simply purchasing candles from a local church auction and using them to light up his colectivo bus. It is said that during one of his routes from Barranquilla to Bogotá, all his passengers felt so deeply moved by this display of faith —perhaps influenced by the trapped smoke— that everyone kept reciting collective prayers and raising their skinny fingers like antennas to heaven.\n\nNewspapers picked up the story and across the country many intermunicipal bus companies proposed emulating the actions of Gonzalo Castillo. One even suggested creating an official route from Cali to Pasto, effectively turning it into a 'church on wheels' with a proper priest delivering proper religious services and sermons to travelers.

col.36.d_1: "Surprisingly, two days ago, we received a meeting request from Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, in which he proposed discussing a potential merger of UNIR into the Liberal Party. The goal would be to run members under a unified ticket for the upcoming presidency.\nThis morning, Gaitán visited the presidential office, where we, along with other party leaders, began discussing the specifics of the proposed political merger. He asserted that many within the Liberal Party would strongly support his return and argued that the political programs of both parties were compatible. He believed that by uniting, the parties would have a better chance of winning the upcoming election compared to staying separate.\n\nWith the president's term coming to an end, incorporating a popular figurehead under the party's banner to ensure victory seems like a logical strategy. Gaitán had established a significant cult of personality around himself, and designating him as our candidate could help regain the support of his followers who are more attached to him as an individual than to his any of his specific political beliefs."
col.36.d_2: "A meeting took place this morning involving the leader of our opposition parties: UNIR and Partido Liberal. It has come to light that Gaitán and the Liberals have been engaged in covert discussions for some time, exploring the possibility of uniting as an opposition force to enhance their chances of winning the upcoming elections.\n\nAfter extensive negotiations, the two sides ultimately reached an agreement, securing Gaitán's candidacy as a member of the Liberal party for the next election cycle. Naturally, this will mark the dissolution of UNIR, and while most of their supporters are expected to align with Gaitán, it is anticipated that hardliners might align with the Syndicalists in the next elections."

As part of the preparations for the upcoming presidential election, party members conducted a vote to determine the party's presidential candidate. Several contenders from within our party put themselves forward for consideration, outlining their strategies to secure victory and their proposed accomplishments as potential leaders.\n\nAmidst the conference's discussions, a consensus gradually emerged among party leaders favoring the selection of a new face to represent the Conservative Party. After some political maneuvering and a round of voting, the majority turned their support towards Carlos Arango Velez as the new party leader and presidential nominee.\nOnce one of APEN most prominent members on the centre-right wing of the party, after APEN's recent electoral losses he decided to distance himself from it and eventually join Colombia's oldest political party. Most felt that Arango Velez experience and deciseveness could be seen by the electorate as a moderate alternative to the extreme stances of Laureano Gómez Castro, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla and the Leopardos, while still satifying the traditionalist and anti-syndicalist sentiments which resonate through the party."

Viera White had recently created quite a stir inside the party, openly opponing Durán's leadership, and calling for people opposing the browderist line to reclaim their right to appoint a new head of PTO. Durán response was quite aggressive and firm but the damage was already done, many fellow party members had seen the recent utter defeat in the election as a signal of what to come with Durán. By unanimous vote the session voted the explusion of Durán and the nomination of Gilberto Viera White. The new leader has already promised he intend to stir the party in a new direction, leaving the browderist ideals, chief amongs Durán's tenure, to the side, along with the intention of pursuing a united left inside UNIR, further expaining that 'if UNIR wants us in they must accept our ideas, it's time we make our voice heard inside the left coalition'."

Interestingly, it was the actions of ordinary citizens on a microeconomic level that played a pivotal role in revitalizing our economy, alongside the passage of time. Most importantly, foreign aid has been instrumental in facilitating the turnaround we are currently witnessing.\n\nNevertheless, let's not deceive ourselves: the electorate has clearly noted the insufficient efforts made by our government to stabilize the economy. While we did our best, the extent of state intervention was limited and fell short of what was necessary. Consequently, our popularity has suffered greatly."

colcw.4.d: "Our sources in Cauca have alerted us this morning to the imminent mobilization of Quintin Lame's guerrilla forces along the northern borders of the Cauca department. This development poses a serious threat, potentially creating a new breach in our defenses and establishing an additional front to the south.\nAccording to reliable reports, it appears that Lame's intentions are to align himself with the [COC.GetName], thereby endorsing their perverse plan to overthrow Bogota's legitimate government through warfare.\nGiven the likelihood of war breaking out in a matter of days or weeks, we must promptly decide on our course of action. We could declare on them now, launching a decisive strike, or alternatively, preparing and strategically waiting for them to initiate an attack against us. The urgency of our decision cannot be overstated as we navigate this critical juncture."
colcw.4.a: "Declare on them now."

colcw.5.t: "Quintin Lame Is Pursuing A Non Agression Pact"
colcw.5.d: "Our most dreaded scenario, the prospect of defending a second, larger front to the south, has been averted. Quintin Lame and his rebellious faction have reconsidered their stance and, at least for the moment, abandoned plans to wage war against us.\nThey have initiated contact with our officers stationed along the southern border, presenting a proposal for a non-aggression agreement. This move is aimed at preventing an open conflict between our forces.\n\nNonetheless, is evident we cannot accept their claim to continue persisting after the [COC.GetName], and order is restored in the Meta and Caqueta departments. While we acknowledge the potential benefits of a temporary peace, we must remain vigilant and consider the implications of such an agreement in the long term. The delicate balance between a temporary respite and safeguarding our long-term interests requires careful consideration at this critical juncture."

Refugees are streaming north, seeking sanctuary from the threat posed by the mad indigenous warlord Quintin Lame and his rabid militias. Meanwhile, socialist factions celebrate the emergence of a broader front against us.\nIn response, we are poised to strike back against both adversaries, determined to emerge victorious in this war. Our goal extends beyond the preservation of our junta; it is a mission critical for the well-being of every Colombian citizen and the future of our great nation.\nWe approach this challenge with unwavering resolve, confident in our ability to secure triumph and safeguard the destiny of Colombia. Together, we will prevail."
colcw.6.a: "¡A las armas!"

colcw.7.t: "Protesters Demand a Ceasefire"
colcw.7.d: "In recent days, as the war increasingly shifts in favor of our adversaries, we have seen a significant rise in protests. Initially generic in nature, the demonstrations have become more focused, with chants and demands now explicitly calling for a ceasefire with the rebels in Meta. What began as a small gathering has grown into a massive crowd, with many protesters camping out in front of the palace and chanting continuously.\nMeanwhile, our foreign minister has discreetly reached out to various regional powers with a moderate to favorable stance toward our government. These contacts have indicated a willingness to serve as mediators should we decide to propose a truce. These negotiations remain highly confidential.\n\nThe situation has become quite problematic. What should our response be?"
colcw.7.a: "Draft and present a ceasefire proposal."

colcw.8.t: "Rojas Pinilla Propose a Ceasefire"
colcw.8.d: "Since the recent protests involving many of Bogotá's citizens, who are tired of the prolonged and seemingly endless war, we have received a ceasefire proposal from the army leaders representing our fellow Colombians in the regions we have yet to reconquer. It is also true that our own people are growing weary of the situation, with concerns that the conflict could continue indefinitely.\n\nOur policy of not negotiating with Pinilla's illegitimate government might lead us to dismiss this proposal outright. However, it is worth reconsidering in light of the war exhaustion affecting our guerrillas and civilians.\nGiven this context, we should seriously consider pursuing a ceasefire agreement as proposed.\n\nIf we choose not to pursue this route, we should evaluate whether this moment of weakness in Bogotá presents an opportunity for a decisive attack. Our generals are prepared for either scenario, so we need to carefully deliberate the best course of action moving forward.\n\nHaving considered these factors, we will..."
colcw.8.a: "Sign the ceasefire."
colcw.8.b: "Attack and destroy them while they're weak."

colcw.9.t: "The Medellín Ceasefire Agreement"
colcw.9.d: "Today, an official ceasefire was signed in Medellín, ceding the territories of Meta and Caquetá to [COC.GetName], at least for the moment. The announcement has divided our populace and exacerbated the growing divide among our people. The mood is more jubilant in [COC.GetName], where the issue was met with parades and joy. Meanwhile, factions of war hawks are actively pushing for a resumption of conflict.\nFor now, our glorious country enjoys a period of peace, but the officialization of the temporary end of conflicts raises the problem of what to do when, inevitably, we come into conflict with our new neighbors to the east. It is clear to everyone, even our enemies, that peaceful coexistence will not be an option.\n\nTonight, we mourn the loss of our territories, but we will resolutely plan our path forward, privately, when no one is watching."
colcw.9.a: "We'll get our lands back, eventually."

colcw.10.t: "Ceasefire Proposal Rejected"
colcw.10.d: "The rebel scum have informed us that our ceasefire proposal has been rejected. This setback is a significant blow to our hopes for peace. The news has shaken the protesters who, in recent days, have increasingly demanded a formal temporary truce. As we predicted, those socialist terrorists who wage war against us couldn't care less about peace; all they want is to subjugate their fellow Colombians.\nFor now, it appears our only option for survival is to take up arms once more and fight with renewed strength and determination."
colcw.10.a: "We'll crush them like cockroaches."

colcw.11.t: "The Army Demands The President Step Down"
colcw.11.d: "In the wake of an official ceasefire and the devastating aftermath of the prolonged conflict, the army has united in a public demand for caudillo Rojas Pinilla to step down from his position, calling for a restoration of democracy. The announcement also hints at serious consequences should he refuse to resign willingly, stating, 'He will be compelled to step down by any means necessary'.\n\nIs Colombia prepared to transition back to democracy so soon after such a catastrophic conflict?"

Settling down into the government offices we earned, we look at the millions of ballots the traditional parties of the conservatives and liberals lost to us.\nWith our political opponents in the election utterly defeated, it is time that we look to the future of this new Colombia.\nAlready we have taken the first steps, having announced the first National Revolutionary Congress which is set to begin in Bogatá in a matter of days. The other socialist parties within the UNIR Bloc have already confirmed their attendance, including the PSC and PTO. The primary topic that many predict will dominate the Congress is said to be the issue of implementing socialist reforms to the country, and how it should be brought about. Concerns regarding our position as a nation in not only South America, but possibly the world, have also begun to spring up and it will indeed be a matter of great importance later down the line.\n\nIt is clear now that this Congress will be quite the hotspot of debate and ideological conflicts, therefore it is imperative that we ensure Colombia does not divide itself even more than it already has."
colsoc.1.a: "Let the National Congress begin!"

colsoc.14.t: "The Congress Begins: Opening Act"
colsoc.14.d: "The Congress has convened, and the first issue on the agenda is how much of our national identity should be redefined.\n\nA motion, initially presented by four representatives — three from the PSC and one Totalist — calls for cutting ties with the old Italian explorer Cristóbal Colón, and adopting a new name for the nation. Though initially seen as symbolic, the proposal gained traction across factions.\nMany argue this debate is more than semantics: a name reflects whether the new government seeks continuity or rupture. It may shape the tone of our entire revolution.\nAmong the more radical proposals, the most popular is to merge two figures dear to rebels of all backgrounds: Agustina, the enslaved woman who burned down the houses of Tolò after a sham trial, and Berbeo, the leader of the 1781 Comuneros Rebellion — forming 'Agustina y Berbeo'. A Totalist minority supports 'Dosmares', emphasizing our unique position between two oceans to project strenght worldwide. However this option has far less support than the previous. Others advocate for a compromise: either prefixing a socialist sounding title to the current name, or adopting 'Colombian Commune', keeping ties to both our rebellious roots and national identity.\n\nAfter heated debate, the Congress has decided..."

colsoc.2.t: "The Congress Continues: Economy"
colsoc.2.d: "The Congress has begun, with the important issue of economy being the first to be discussed amongst the various socialist parties.\nAfter some time, there was a general consensus on one aspect: to implement socialist reforms immediately is not feasible. The majority of attendees concurred that our primary focus should be on stabilizing and securing the economy, especially considering the widespread impact of Black Monday across the country. Furthermore, it was agreed that we should gently begin to implement state policies and investments as a starting effort to combat the economic inequality that is rife in Colombia.\n\nThe unanimous agreements began to end there, as there were different ideas on which exact sector of the economy should be given attention to first - UNIR and the PSC both agree that investing into developing resources is the right choice, however whereas the UNIR suggested further excavation in our more untapped regions, the PSC support the research of synthetic refineries as an attempt to boost our industrial management of our natural resources.\nOn the other hand, the Totalists call for dividing our economic efforts in two fronts, by boosting military spending and to keep our weapon factories up to date, seeing as our guns are essentially obsolete, simultaneously, stressing the importance of connecting rural areas to urban centers, thus incentivizing commerce and facilitating resource exchanges."

colsoc.3.t: "Industrialists Begin Protesting!"
colsoc.3.d_1: "Ever since their establishment in recent times, ANDI have stood as one of our biggest roadblocks on our path to develop a more fair society in Colombia. Representing the wills of corporations and landowners across Colombia, they fervently object to any decision we make at every chance they get. Now is no exception either - despite the economic plan decided on in the Congress being rather moderate, their leaders have denounced it and have organised a massive, nation-wide strike against us. It seems that their irrational fear of socialist policies is so strong that they are willing to plung the nation into further chaos just to politically starve and root us out, and this is evident by the fact that many factories and farms are shutting down in protest. We have had the Syndicalists and the PTO demand that we put an immediate end to this uproar by deploying militias and the army to restablish order and disperse the crowds gathering in the capital. However, our most trusted advisors within the party have reccomended a more soft-handed approach, and that we must placate the demands of the protestors."

colsoc.4.t: "The Congress Continues: Foreign Affairs"
colsoc.4.d: "The Revolutionary Congress has faced challenging days. While most issues were settled without much conflict, today a far more controversial question arose: what will Colombia's stance be on foreign matters, and where will we stand on the international stage?\n\nFrom the early hours of the day, a heated debate has unfolded among the three branches of our political union, each providing a different answer. Eventually, a consensus was reached during the discussion when a delegate proposed shifting the focus of our foreign affairs deliberation towards handling neighboring countries, due to the imminent threat they could pose to our revolution.\nOur party took the initiative to address the importance of securing our nation's immediate future instead of seeking external conflicts. We suggested adopting an assertive approach if necessary, while simultaneously assuring our neighbors that our new revolution is unique in the Latin American context and emphasizing our commitment to domestic affairs. This, we argued, would safeguard national unity and serve as a model of resilience for other Socialist nations.\nThe PSC, in contrast, have thrown their support in with the Third Internationale, branding them the 'biggest safety net against the imperialist rats', despite acknowledging the Commune of France's limited support for their South American counterparts. They dismissed reassuring neighbors as a lesser priority for a genuine revolutionary state and concluded their stance with the famous Marx quote, 'workers of the world, unite.'.\nLastly, the Totalists proposed catching adversaries off guard through preemptive mobilization. However, [COL.GetColombianTotLeaderLastName] left unclear whether this strategy meant launching an attack on our neighbors or simply displaying force to deter threats. Speculation arises that he may intend both options, adapting strategy as the situation evolves.\nHaving heard perspectives from all coalition parties, it is now time to adopt a collective stance on this pivotal matter..."
colsoc.4.a: "We must avoid another stupid war!"
colsoc.4.b: "The Internationale will protect our interests."
colsoc.4.c: "We will strive and be ready for war!"

colsoc.5.t: "The protests turn violent!"
colsoc.5.d: "Despite our hopes, the Industrialists have shown no sign of halting their protests or resuming factory operations. Adding to the turmoil, the Chulavitas have escalated violence to an unprecedented extent, aiding the protestors. Disturbingly, there's a growing number of reports detailing these terrorists attacking our party headquarters in Bogotá.\nSimilar incidents are unfolding in Barranquilla, where the protesters have turned hostile toward the police forces attempting to maintain order. This has led to numerous severe injuries and even a few fatalities.\n\nThe nation is gripped by a state of paralysis, with an impending crisis looming overhead. Each passing day further transforms our once-vibrant country into a desolate landscape, devoid of prosperity and dignity. Amidst this chaos, we find ourselves compelled to quell the protests through force, with no time to spare."
colsoc.5.a: "There's no other option."

colsoc.6.t: "Last Day of Congress: Internal Affairs"
colsoc.6.d_1: "As the Congress begins to come to a close, it is obvious that the Totalists have neither the support nor the numbers needed to influence to get their proposed measures adopted in both the matter of the economy or foreign policy. Now, as a result, their delegates are split on supporting the ideals of one of the two other parties, rather than their own. Today, the Congress turn to the subject of internal matters within the nation. Today, the Congress turn to the subject of internal matters within the nation. As expected, we took a clear stance on supporting the minorities in our nation, a policy that acts as one of the cornerstones of our socioeconomic program. Our proposal involves including them more in our militias and starting a program of weapon distribution to all revolutionaries, ensuring their protection against their past oppressors. On the other hand, the PSC have suggested the creation of the 'Congreso de Sindicatos Colombianos'; a national union of syndicates akin to how the Commune of France or Union of Britain operate."

colsoc.6.c: "It's time that we pay a visit to our dear Señor Rojas Pinilla..."

colsoc.7.t: "The Field Marshal's Medal..."
colsoc.7.d: "Weeks of careful observation had culminated in the perfect opportunity for the arrests of Field Marshal Rojas Pinilla and General París Gordillo, on suspicion of reactionary sympathies. París Gordillo has been invited to Rojas Pinilla's villa located in the outskirts of Bogotá for what was described as a 'serious concern' in his letter. Soon our militiamen were in position, with the ends of their rifles glaring at every opening. Though there was no sign of the Field Marshal himself, our men waited patiently. As Gordillo arrived, he waited yet his host would never arrive.\n\nThe silence was broken as the screech of a bullet pierced the air - chaos erupted as the militiamen stormed into the house. Startled from the sudden uproar, it seemed that Gordillo had attempted to fire at one of the militiamen but was shot dead before he could pull the trigger. Further investigation found that the first shot was towards a figure that one of the men saw bolting from the back door, away into the wilderness. We can only conclude that it was Rojas Pinilla himself who managed to flee. That, and the fact that a sapphire-blue medal was discovered by the edges of the woods, cracked and chipped in its centre; it was the 'Orden de Boyacá', Rojas Pinilla's most prized possession.\n\nHe will most certainly never show his face around ever again, and as far as the rest of the nation is concerned, there was never a man by the name of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, or Gabriel París Gordillo."

colsoc.9.t: "Chaos in Colombia" #for other rightwing neighbours countries
colsoc.9.d: "Recently our government have made a contact with the Colombian Christian-Conservative activists of 'Las Chulavitas'. They have reached out to us for assistance in addressing the ongoing crisis in their country, a request that comes as no surprise to our advisors.\nSince the victory of the Socialist coalition UNIR, comprised of various factions of socialists, Colombia has been engulfed in a wave of crime and chaos. The Chulavitas have shared harrowing accounts of the brutal oppression faced by peaceful protestors in recent days, a reality not difficult for us to accept given similar instances of socialist rule around the world in recent years. Moreover, they report widespread questioning of the legitimacy of the election results among Colombian citizens.\n\nThey, alongside other nationalist parties, implore us to intervene promptly by supporting autonomous militias to restore order and defend Christian values, which they claim UNIR has desecrated. While Chulavitas leader Laureano Gomez Castro assures us that such intervention would swiftly lead to the collapse of the Colombian government, we cannot solely rely on his assurances. Many voices within our own government have expressed reluctance to intervene, fearing the risk of sparking outright war.\nThis may be our only chance in swiftly restoring peace to our fragile neighbour and our borders."

colsoc.12.t: "Military Coup Avoided!" 
colsoc.12.d: "Seemingly against the odds, we have managed to prevent the military coup lead by those reactionary dogs wearing medals. Our government wisely heeded the rumors of an uprising; thankfully, most of the said rumors were inflated by those indifferent to the well-being of our nation's workers.\n\nThe meager force assigned to besiege Bogotá suffered a humiliating failure, becoming the subject of global ridicule. We promptly detected their coup plans and acted decisively, vindicating our approach. The military elements loyal to previous rulers couldn't rally enough support for their cause and have been dealt with.\n\nWhile this is a major victory for the Colombian workers, as we have managed to keep control and prevented a coup, it is unlikely that the reactionaries will stop at this attempt to topple us, unless we keep obstaculting them and their evil plans.\nWe may have obscured this uprising from the public eye, but we must remain ever vigilant."

col.901.t: "Controlling the System"
col.901.d: "It appears that we are in a troublesome lack of competent bureaucrats to place in the system as we are trying to fill out the government with those loyal to our regime. The party majority are still untrusting of the army and wish to place political commissars in their ranks to ensure loyalty, while some others are suggesting we should focus our efforts on the civil apparatus to ensure that local provinces and the common worker's needs are fulfilled. Both are measures to ensure security, but the question is whether we should focus on the army or a local level of loyalty."

col.902.t: "Decent Living Conditions for Everyone"
col.902.d: "Our government is adamant to defeat homelessness as well as the shanty's that rural villages have become accustomed to. Now of course the first obvious thought is to begin a large-scale effort to build more houses, making large sprawls of housing outside our cities for people to live in. But once we take a look at the possible cost of this, it makes it a more difficult decision. Our alternative would be to repurpose buildings that are not used and fix those that our citizens currently live in, much more cost effective however experts show it would be a temporary plug in the widening gap, meaning that we might be risking our reputation by passing the problem onto the next generation of government. We must choose how to help out our people the best we can."

This issue pertains to the federalization debate, grappling with the balance of power between states and the central government. Various proposals have arisen, advocating extensive autonomy for newly formed states to govern labor, security, and business, while others argue for central control over fundamental laws and the nation's global direction. Whichever path is chosen, it's inevitable that there will be discontent from reactionary and conservative factions that have consistently opposed our approach."

After well photographed images of the two parties greeting and shaking hands, they drove to Paris soon after where they were welcomed by a warm reception from the French populace and even socialist aligned Spaniards who were currently in France. After talks and celebrations with the members of the French and other Internationale representatives, we have thoroughly strengthened our bonds together and showed ourselves to the world to be friends of fellow socialists."

col.776.t: "Fernando Gonzalez's New Book"
col.776.d: "Renowned philosopher and author Fernando Gonzalez Ochoa is a beloved figure in Medellin, well-regarded in both journalistic and political circles. Initially a classical center-left liberal, he became disillusioned with the party during ex-president Olaya Herrera's leadership and has since fearlessly critiqued whichever government held power, both in his writings and books. Many of us expected more of the same criticism, but to our surprise, the philosopher from Envigado actually praised our recent efforts.\n\nDespite his strong objections to our policy of encouraging Aryan immigration to purify our mestizo race, a topic that fills half of the pages in his latest book, the other half is filled with glowing praise for our ability to challenge the theocratic tyranny of the Catholic establishment in Colombia, our emphasis on personal accountability and self-growth, and our leadership approach, which he describes as 'the most wonderfully authoritarian since Simon Bolivar'.\nIn today meeting all it was talked about inevitably reverted back to the subject of Fernando Gonzalez Ochoa and his new book. Jose Camancho Carreno suggested inviting the philosopher to join our group, perhaps by offering him a local government position in Medellin. Everybody entusiastically agreed.\n\nMorale is as high as a kite."
col.776.a: "Send Fernando a present."

col.777.t: "Warning Signs"
col.777.d: "During the latest meeting of the ruling council of the main Leopardos some trouble arose. While Eliseo Arango and Jose Camancho Carreno spoke of their plans for the future which included fortifying the nations racial identity, championing anti-Imperialism and reshaping the armed forces, two other Leopardo idealogues, Augusto Ramierez Moreno and Joaquin Fidalgo Hermida stayed silent, sitting a corner smoking and paying little if any attention.\nWhen Arango addressed them and asked for their opinions they responded curtly, exchanged glances then returned to their previous routine of smoking and disinterest. The rest of the meeting went smoothly but at the end Villegas called Camancho aside and told him what was going on.\n\nMoreno and Hermida had attended a recent lecture given by philosopher Fernando Gonzalez Ochoa, a man known in Leopardos and outsiders circles, mainly for his views on Latin racial purity, complete state-church separation, esotericism, and for his love for Nietzsche and his theories. While to the average observer these views may seem not too different from our own, his goals differ a lot, as he considers nationalism and authoritarianism simply as a necessary mean to bring about a new age where every citizens is free from the state and lives according to his own personal principles in complete anarchy, an ideology he likes to call 'Anarcototalitarianism' as he explained in many of his books and more recently in his self-published newspaper 'Revista Antioquia'.\nIf we let Moreno and Hermida go they could rally more of these crypto-Oachian supporters to our cause or alienate the radicals and split the party. We must respond before things get out of hand."
col.777.a: "We shouldn't worry for now."
col.777.b: "Confront them at the next meeting."
col.777.c: "It's enough to expel them!"

col.778.t: "Ignorance Isn't Always Bliss"
col.778.d: "Augusto Moreno and Joaquin Hermida were once again quiet and all together disinterested during today's meeting, again; not speaking once during the entire event. At the end they spoke with each other and Villegas and, after a long discussion, resigned from the party.\n\nMoving quickly the Council has managed to talk to Villegas and has convinced him to revoke his resignation. However, that was only stemming the bleeding. Moreno and Hermida have already severed their ties with us."
col.778.a: "We don't need them."

col.779.t: "Reconciliation"
col.779.d: "We confronted Moreno and Hermida at the meeting today and, after a long and sometimes heated discussion, the pair were convinced to stay with us. They have agreed that leaving would split the party and leave us weaker than if we stay united. In return for their continued support we have agreed to adopt certain aspects of their new platform. This has left the more moderate and left wing of the party wary but through careful diplomacy we have managed to assuage their fears as well. The crisis has passed and we have come out the other side stronger than ever."
col.779.a: "¡Unidos en la victoria!"

col.780.t: "Three Cubs Leave the Den"
col.780.d: "At today's meeting of the Council we wasted no time in laying into the treachery of Moreno and Hermida. Accusations of treason flew and emotions got heated.\nAfter the denunciations ended Moreno and Hermida exploded into a rage. They launched into a sudden and lengthy rant denouncing our ideals and views. They said the political landscape of Colombia has changed severely since the publication of our Nationalist Manifesto and events have outrun us. They then outlined their own view of a nationalist Colombia, united in spirit and purpose to uplift the Latin American man to his greatest form based on the ideas of Ochoa.\n\nThe dual speeches lasted a total of seven hours. At its end the ministers sat for a moment, frozen in shock and not a little bit of terror at the sheer anger and rage displayed by the two men. After a moment of silence the room erupted into a chorus of boos and cheers as each man picked their side.\nSatisfied by their actions, the two men then left the room without another word or so much as glancing at Carreno or Arango. Not long after Villegas, convinced by their passionate speeches, followed them out. Meanwhile Carreno and Arango looked at eachother with surprised and confused glances, still speechless and wondering what came next."
col.780.a: "That was something."

col.781.t: "The Fracture"
col.781.d: "Today in a speech in Bogata, Fernando Gonzales Ochoa, along with Moreno and Hermida, announced the formation of a new party opposed to the Leopardos. This is done in flagrant violation to the fact that by law, a law which was crafted in part by Moreno and Hermida themselves, political parties in Colombia are banned.\nThe party clearly aims to stir up popular anger at the government and serve as a lightning rod for the former politicians displaced by the Leopardos's iron fisted rule. While the party is still in its infancy there is a lot to suggest they will quickly become the greatest threat the Leopardos have yet faced.\n\nOchoa, Moreno and Hermida are rather small political figures, but their message that our political program is behind the times resonates with much of the populace and even among our own Council who are now demanding we modernize our Party, starting with a new leader. Some have proposed Gilberto Alzate Avedano, one of the most conservative figures in our government, will lead us into the future. Others worry Gilberto's greed and extremism would only alienate moderates in the party and tug at the seams of our state. Despite their reservations, for better and for worse, we must make a decision."
col.781.a: "Gilberto Alzate Avedano would make for a strong new figurehead."
col.781.b: "Stay the course that has brought us this far."

col.783.t: "Change of Leadership"
col.783.d: "With Moreno and Hermida calming down, we thought our problems were over. Unfortunately, fate had other plans. The news of the mutiny somehow spread while we were still managing the situation, and it reached the ears of our international supporters. We swiftly became the subject of ridicule on the global stage, to the extent that a foreign prime minister with close ties to our government is exploring alternative partnerships.\n\nThis perilous division threatens our international standing. Unless we act swiftly and decisively to demonstrate that we not only quelled our fellow Leopardos but also implemented significant changes to consolidate our power, our reputation will continue to suffer.\nIn today's ruling council meeting, it was decided that Gilberto Alzate Avedano, one of the most conservative figures in our government, will lead us into the future. While some may have concerns about Gilberto's greed and extremism potentially alienating moderates within the party and straining our state's fabric, we must, for better or worse, show our international allies that we have a capable presidential leader. Carlos Cortes Vargas, may God bless him, simply no longer suffices."
col.783.a: "Gilberto will lead us to the future!"

col.782.t: "Skinning the Leopard"
col.782.d: "Today our folly has been made plain for all to see. The new party, led by Gonzalez Ochoa, has garnered significant popular and military support, paving the way for a bloodless coup. Supporters spanning the political spectrum, from moderate socialists to radical democrats, united to oust the Leopardos from power.\nDuring an emergency meeting of the ruling Leopardos Council, the military and activists occupied Bogotá and rounded up everybody in the government in one fell swoop. Not one bullet was fired, as all ministers and governament officials immediately turned their back on their party, and guards simply opened the doors to the Congress to let us in. No longer their closest allied seemed to care much for keeping them in power. Their disastrous goverment will go down in history as both the shortest and worst since the independence from Spain. Their repressive paternalism has being replaced with another form of the same authoritarianism but with a very different end goal: COMPLETE FREEDOM!\n\nAfter just two hours of radio silence Fernando Gonzalez Ochoa has been named leader of the new Colombia or as he calls it... Otraparte!"
col.782.a: "Everybody must salute the new president!"

#FOCUS EVENTS
colfocus.1.t: "Selecting a New Legislation"
colfocus.1.d: "Several new legislations has reached the presidential desk in response to our coalition's requests. Approximately twenty proposals were presented by our ministers and coalition members, with three singled out by the party's secretary as the most effective and easiest to implement.\n\nFirstly, there's a proposal to grant tax breaks to foreign corporations, aimed at stimulating our heavy industry and mining sector. This initiative arises from the interest of a Canadian businessman in establishing a large emerald industry in Meta, extracting and cutting emeralds from the nearby Caqueta department. Unfortunately, the only remaining large emerald deposit not already granted to private enterprises is almost entirely located right under a spot sacred to the indigenous people living there.\nThe second proposed legislation is one that is expected to help with the dire situation our armed forces are facing, by trying to shift the blame away from them and make it fall squarely on the shoulders of our predecessors.\nLastly an APEN senator proposed publicly a reform to the electoral system that will eliminate the possibility, introduced by the previous short-lived liberal administration, to form electoral coalitions and run as such. This proposition would be very interesting in that we at the moment are, according to our recent electoral polls, in the lead as a single party outside of coalitions, and because UNIR is leading in that category, once we make unlawful to run as such, they are bound to incour in internal problems as is often the case with socialist infighting. Once they are out of the picture we could focus on regrouping the liberal party in one unitary party under our new centrist paradigm.\n\nNow is our time to act, we should focus on..."

colfocus.1.b: "...supporting our army."
colfocus.1.c: "...the electoral reform."

colfocus.2.t: "Selecting an Harbour"
colfocus.2.d: "Now that we've successfully diversified our economic output and moved beyond subsistence farming and low-value plantations, it's time to streamline the export process through substantial infrastructure investment in one of our major ports.\nBoth the Caribe and Cauca regions have previously requested additional funds, initiated by our predecessors, to achieve the desired results. They have developed tailored urban and logistical plans to maximize the benefits from our investments. The choice between the two regions ultimately comes down to our personal judgment.\nSo, which one will we prioritize for the initial investment?"
colfocus.2.a: "The Caribe region."
colfocus.2.b: "The Cauca region."

colfocus.3.t: "APEN and Liberals, a Future Togheter?"
colfocus.3.d: "A few days ago, at the APEN headquarters in Bogotá, politicians and journalists eagerly awaited one of the most important announcements in recent times. Delegates from the Partido Liberal arrived in the early evening, joined us for a small buffet and later took their places amongs our representatives.\n\nAs requests and polemics filled the room with noise, someone entered the room from the service door. It was Mario Galán Gómez, a rising figure in the Liberal Party, widely expected to lead once Pumarejo steps down or is forced to do so. Rather tame in apperance yet fierce in the political arena, he stood for a few seconds scanning the room before opening his arms, gesturing for the sitting president to come and shake his hand. Photographers flashed their cameras at the two while discussions on economic policies and the budget continued around them.\nAmong those who remained aloof was Alfonso López Pumarejo, seated at his honorary table and nervously checking his watch throughout the evening, lifting his glance maybe once or twice troughout the event.\n\nOnce the photos were taken and the debates had subsided, the president took the microphone to outline APEN's plans for the next election. His speech was met with applause from most in attendance.\n\nYesterday, just as the doors of the presidential palace were about to close for the day, former minister and Partido Liberal representative Darío Echandía brought the good news: the party had decided to accept APEN's offer and was ready for the next meeting to finalize the merger.\nThen, as his glass was filled with whiskey in celebration, he posed the crucial question: who the president believed should be presented at the next joint delegation meeting as the candidate for the upcoming presidential election. The president sat at his desk and, without hesitation, gave his answer..."
colfocus.3.a: "Mario Galan Gomez."
colfocus.3.b: "Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo."
colfocus.3.c: "One of our APEN men: Eduardo Santos Montejo."

colfocus.43.t: "Happy Soldiers Makes A Safe Country"
colfocus.43.d: "For too long, our armed forces have grappled with discontent and skepticism toward the very institutions they swore to defend. Fortunately, this tide is turning. Through our comprehensive benefits programs tailored to all ranks, we are steadily eliminating the unrest that once plagued our military. Our commitment to incrementally enhancing benefits, with greater rewards for higher-ranking officials, we are fostering a more committed and satisfied force for the future.\n\nWhile the enhancements in recreational leaves, vacations, pensions, and other benefits undoubtedly impose a strain on our treasury, the protection of our borders and citizens stands as our paramount concern. Those who safeguard the nation deserve proper compensation and recognition that has been long overdue.\n\nNot only do these initiatives foster a more focused military, dedicated to its core responsibilities, but they also signal a definitive end to any lingering contemplation of undermining democratic institutions. Experts widely attest to this positive shift, affirming that the era of internal strife and dissent within our armed forces is now firmly behind us."
colfocus.43.a: "Let's celebrate."

colfocus.4.t: "Investing in Utopian Projects"
colfocus.4.d: "While exploring potential areas for large-scale projects, numerous options have surfaced, each falling into either urban or rural categories. As an initial step, we could prioritize enhancing water distribution and processing systems, benefiting both major cities and rural regions. Additionally, there is strong merit in examining the expansion and modernization of our healthcare infrastructure. However, the two most ambitious ideas, bordering on utopian, involve initiatives aimed at significantly improving living standards and economic prosperity.\n\nFirstly, the proposal for the widespread and free distribution of new farming machinery to key agricultural centers holds immense promise. This initiative not only promises to elevate living standards but also stands to bolster profits in economically disadvantaged areas.\nSecondly, there's the ambitious undertaking of urban renewal projects to meticulously plan the expansion and development of our cities. This endeavor would include strategic considerations such as the creation of vast green spaces, ensuring sustainable urban growth. Furthermore, envisioning the commissioning of a monumental landmark symbolizing progress and unity is a grand idea. Much like the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building, such an iconic structure would serve as a beacon, attracting tourists and embodying our collective aspirations for a prosperous future."

We now have an opportunity to avoid an unecessary war in excange of giving them back Guayana, with the added benefit of an exclusive trade deal that would mean we could still benefit from a substantial percentace the region's minerary resources without having to spend anything in the mantenance of the mines nor the salaries of the miners, all that would be handled by [COL.GetName] for us and we would just enjoy the profits."

colfocus.15.t: "Giving away San Andrés and Providencia"
colfocus.15.d: "Our proposal for exclusive deals and benefits in exchange for the claimed territories has been finalized and is ready for submission. However, the politicians and generals in charge have suggested a last-minute addendum. It's known that our potential partners have long desired the islands of San Andrés and Providencia, which, despite being distant and isolated, hold limited practical value for us. By conceding these islands to them while maintaining the benefits we originally proposed, we might significantly enhance our chances of sealing this much-needed deal.\nWhile the archipelago east of Nicaragua presents more challenges than practical advantages, many of its inhabitants strongly identify as Colombians and would resist being overlooked or sold to the highest bidder. The time has come to definitively decide the fate of this isolated archipelago."

Despite our best efforts, our neighbor's greed prevented them from joining us in building a better and more peaceful future. While some are clamoring for punitive action to take what's rightfully ours, we must consider what is truly in our best interest at this moment.\n\nWe are on the path to becoming a world superpower, a destiny that seems increasingly evident even to the most pessimistic among us. With or without additional territories, greatness awaits us. Do we really need another war, and would it uplift the morale of our people? These questions remain unanswered, but with diplomacy no longer an option, we face two realistic prospects: postpone this matter for the time being or wage a war, leveraging our propaganda machinery to reunite our historical lands once and for all."

colfocus.44.d: "In the short time since the antitrust law passed to protect our nation's economy, our GDP has significantly risen. People are now buying from smaller companies, offering a choice of brands, which boosts confidence in our government's commitment to consumer protection. However, it's evident from the start that major conglomerates are displeased with our intervention in their affairs. Even consistent supporters of our presidential ticket are turning to moderate left parties advocating tariff abolition and selling our nation to foreign powers.\nWe, on the other hand, reject globalization, though CEOs immediate concerns cloud their judgment. More concerning, companies already controlled by foreign trusts are ignoring the new rules.\n\nOne such entity, a private film production company, owned by influential Hollywood executives through a parent company based in Los Angeles, audaciously seeks preferential treatment, asserting its superiority over other trusts. In exchange they promise support for the Colombian government under certain conditions, especially during times of war or political unrest.\nSuch a proposition is deeply immoral, and the public should be aware of these big businesses' true intentions. Nevertheless, it could be advantageous to establish a strong propaganda partnership."

However, is also true that history teaches us that a supreme commander in charge of Gran Colombia failed in the past, so why not rebuild the nation as a proper democracy this time?\n\nThe announcment is ready: 'I nominate president of Gran Colombia...'"

colfocus.47.d: "Now that the mais baised moonshine drink known as Chicha has been officially outlawed more the streets once full of drunk people are booming with new life and productivity. In poorer rural areas productivity has increased of a whole 1%.\nHowever, the demand for affordable alternatives persists. Wine is reserved for the upper classes, liquor is too expensive for the common man due to increased taxation, and Aguardiente faces the same fate.\n\nAs a result, an increasing number of people are turning to Bavaria-branded beer, thanks to a recently established factory near Bogotà city center. Speculation surrounds the moonshine ban's origins, with suggestions that Bavaria's lobbying played a significant role. Although some evidence supports this claim, our economy minister vehemently denies any such influence, attributing the initiative to a desire to set a positive precedent for public health.\nThat may as well be true, but, suspiciusly, the very same minister later this week announced will take a vacation to a remote paradise island where, for pure coincidence, Bavaria's CEO owns a luxurious villa.\n\nEither way, the positive effect justifies whatever shady deals may have happened in the backrooms of the palace."

In a city-wide celebration destined to be the first of many, most of Medellin inhabitants took to the streets and partied as if there were no tomorrow. The economy and tourism in Medellin surged by 120 percent for the entire week. Among the parades and fireworks, the main event was the grand opening of the president's residence to the public.\n\nThe castle, inspired by medieval Central European architecture with a touch of Louis XIV and Italian Baroque influences, undoubtedly captivated the public. Visitors were particularly awed by the president's library, which housed rare treasures not found anywhere else in Colombia, and a grand bust of Mozart. The opulent displays of wealth throughout the palace left such a lasting impression that rumors suggest businessmen across the country are planning to replicate similar constructions for their own estates.\nSide note: The gains from entrance tickets have already been transferred to the president's private account in Panama, as instructed."

colfocus.70.d: "As the sun left his place to the dark night in the silent mountains of Cauca, a column of people began marching through the city of Popayán, bearing torches and lanterns and chanting in a language foreign to the people living there. As they approached the city center, it became clear that these were followers of Quintin Lame, with Lame himself leading the procession down the streets.\nUpon reaching Popayán's 'Nuestra Señora de la Asunción' cathedral, they sat down while continuing their chants. The mayor and the local police chief were alerted and rushed to the cathedral along with a small group of army cadets from the nearby military base. There, Quintin Lame addressed them publicly, delivering a message intended for the president.\n\nIn his address, Lame declared: 'White men may choose to wage war among themselves, a matter that does not concern us. However, I, along with many Nasa people, remember vividly the horrors of the last conflict among the white men. My brother perished, my sister was scarred for life, and many Nasa families suffered. We will not allow history to repeat itself. Either the white man keeps his hands off our ancestral lands, or we will view this as a matter of self-protection for our people. We demand the right to defend ourselves without interference from the government. We do not seek your protection. Keep your soldiers away from our lands.'\n\nNot long after the message was telegraphed to its destination, the protesters dispersed and returned, this time in silence, to their villages nestled in the mountains."

colfocus.71.t: "The Afrocolombian Population is in Peril"
colfocus.71.d: "In the past three days, the Caribe region has seen a sharp rise in homicides, primarily affecting Afro-Colombian individuals. Black activists have been mysteriously disappearing, and the situation shows no signs of improvement. Locals are openly expressing racist views in public spaces, like restaurants and cafes, and they even raise their voice when potential victims are within earshot.\n\nThis surge in violence appears linked to lingering tensions from the aftermath of the Bogotazo, where repressed racial biases have found expression in physical attacks. Currently, major cities like Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Santa Marta are heavily policed, but rural areas and smaller communities remain vulnerable. It is expected we will intervene by sending more men to protect the population from itself, but we will also need to strategically reallocate the vast resoruces that we are currently using to protect our ports and shipyards into guarding the countryside. Failure to take action could lead to surviving black activists inciting further disorder in response to the prevailing racism across the country. In the worst-case scenario, they might even consider supporting socialist terrorists in the Caribe."

colfocus.56.d: "Since the general election, rumors of a potential coup have intensified within our ranks. The involvement of high-ranking commanders and the extent of their influence on troops remain unclear. With tensions escalating daily, swift and discreet action is imperative.\nNow that Congress has adjourned, we have identified three candidates among lower-ranking officials who could serve as reliable informants within the military.\n\nOur three candidates are Guillermo Tenorio Colorado, a first corporal and top student in his military school, secretly affiliated with our militias, known for a short temper but less likely to raise suspicion; Sergeant Lorenzo Murillo, reputedly trustworthy among the upper ranks despite concealing totalist affiliations, acting as a conduit for letters on behalf of suspected plotter General Rafael Navas Pardo. Lastly, Sergeant Juan Manuel Costa, the youngest candidate, serves as personal secretary to General Deogracias Fonseca Espinosa, although his political leanings are ambiguous. Who shall we approach for this delicate operation?"
colfocus.56.a: "The first corporal, the unsuspected insider."
colfocus.56.b: "Letters may contain crucial details, hire the sergeant."

colfocus.57.t: "Our Spy Has Failed Us"
colfocus.57.d_1: "Today's update brings disappointing news: our operative, First Corporal Guillermo Tenorio Colorado, was unable to uncover any evidence indicating that the officers within his social circle are plotting to overthrow our legitimate government. Instead, their attention appears to be concentrated on countering Rojas Pinilla and his allies. This isn't entirely surprising, given their ambitious pursuits and the intense power struggles inside our armed forces. Unfortunately, our spy's efforts have yielded little beyond identifying several medium to high-ranking officials whom we can potentially rely on."
colfocus.57.d_2: "Unfortunately, today delivered discouraging news as our operative, Sergeant Lorenzo Murillo, could not uncover any evidence linking General Rafael Navas Pardo to the alleged plot against our legitimate government. While Navas Pardo's potential involvement cannot be ruled out, he has proven remarkably discreet in his communications, leaving no trace for us to analyze. Despite our diligent efforts, concrete evidence remains elusive, leaving us to navigate this delicate situation based on speculation alone."
colfocus.57.a: "Better luck next time?"

colfocus.58.t: "Our Spy Succedes"
colfocus.58.d: "We managed to foil the plot thanks to the invaluable assistance of our insider spy, Sergeant Juan Manuel Costa. During a pivotal meeting among General Deogracias Fonseca Espinosa and his inner circle within the army, Sergeant Costa seized an opportune moment when documents were briefly unguarded during a restroom break. These documents contained intricate plans and crucial details, which were promptly destroyed after the meeting. However, Sergeant Costa, displaying remarkable discretion, committed them to memory and later transcribed them for our benefit, evading detection throughout.\n\nAs the threat against us intensifies, our vigilance and intelligence gathering have provided invaluable insights, enabling us to take proactive measures to safeguard our government."

The President and his aides pore over details, preparing meticulously for the discussions that will shape our relationships abroad. Already, we're starting to see the first glimpses of progress back home, with rumors swirling about foreign companies showing keen interest in what we have to offer.\n\nThe prospect of cultivating new trade partnerships and strengthening dialogue with our international counterparts has ignited a wave of enthusiasm.

Along our journey, we met numerous industry leaders who were deeply impressed by our nation. This has translated into a wave of new companies establishing operations within our borders.

colfocus.323.d: "Under our recent national economic diversification plan, emphasizing state-guided industrial development, regions traditionally dependent on agriculture have witnessed rapid growth in both light and heavy industries within months of implementation. The noteworthy progress includes the establishment of numerous new factories. In Cartagena, a newly founded shipbuilding factory has achieved remarkable efficiency, producing the first-ever Afro-Colombian-made destroyer, named 'José Antonio Galan' after the leader of the 1781 Comuneros rebellion. Other successes include the globally benchmarked 'Refinería Nacional de Petróleo en Beneficio de la Revolución' in Barrancabermeja and the 'Fábrica Textil Comunitaria del Cauca' in Cali.\n\nHowever, not everyone seemed to grasp the true essence of what a factory represents. One particular case that drew considerable attention occurred in Boyacá.\nIn this region, a colossal industrial facility was erected near Sogamoso, commissioned by local state representatives. Until recently, the facility's purpose remained a mystery. It has now been revealed that some were uncertain about Boyacá's potential specialization and embarked on a surprising endeavor: mass-producing... arepas! This beloved dish, crafted from corn flour and cheese, holds a special place in Boyacá's culinary tradition. With an audacious vision, some decided that their unique contribution to our revolution should be the establishment of the first and largest 'Fábrica Nacional de Arepas.'\n\nThese combined efforts are set to bolster our production capabilities significantly, encompassing ships, petroleum, textiles, and unexpectedly... arepas."

Many of our devoted supporters have eagerly packed their bags and charted their preferred routes using the book as a guide for self-discovery and personal growth.\nSTo ensure compliance, checkpoints have been set up nationwide. Failure to comply results in loss of citizenship and expulsion.\n\nWhile some see this as a step towards liberation from societal norms and reconnection with nature and others, the government's assertive enforcement has led many to silently accept the narrative of 'It's for your own good'. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that both a goal-driven mindset and sales of the 1929 book will soar in the near future, as most citizens complete their state-mandated journeys towards self-improvement."

This mandate must be enforced rigorously, with transgressors facing the ultimate penalty.\n\nToday, I must address several cases of egregious violations that have come to my attention. Among them, a suspected murderer stands accused of the heinous act of killing his wife; a drug peddler who callously distributes narcotics to our children; a bank robber intercepted during a desperate attempt to escape; and a policeman alleged to have neglected his duty in apprehending a perpetrator involved in a serious domestic dispute, allowing him to evade justice.\n\nIn exercising my authority, I must exemplify the supremacy of our collective welfare over individual interests by choosing..."

colfocus.667.d_1: "Today's trial commenced in the early hours of the morning, bringing before the stand the defendant: a middle-aged man clad in an elegantly tailored dress. He stands accused of the murder of his terminally ill wife. When asked the reason for his act he replied in a well spoken manner explaining that following the loss of his well-paid job and a descent into quiet despair seeing her costanly suffering, he initially intended to flee to North America. However, his fragile mental state overcame him, leading to the regrettable act. He pleads guilty.\n\nIn my notes, I contemplated a philosophical perspective on his case: 'In the context of his actions towards his wife, one could argue from a philosophical standpoint that her homicide could have been perceived as a release from her suffering. Furthermore, personal identity is intricately linked to rational thought, self-awareness, and meaningful engagement with the world. In this light, their right to self-determination and dignity may supersede the sanctity of preserving life at any cost. Lastly, from a Nietzschean perspective, the defendant's actions might be interpreted as an expression of his will, as an attempt to assert his own values and power in a scenario that otherwise rendered him powerless.'\nHowever, the case against him is stark: he did, indeed, take his wife's life, thereby causing harm to others.\n\nAs the verdict was announced, I found him..."
colfocus.667.d_2: "Today's trial commenced in the early hours of the morning, bringing before the stand the defendant: a young homeless man in his late twenties, clad in shabby attire. He stands accused of selling hard drugs to childrens. Despite his denial of such a heinous act, he detailed his ongoing struggle with substance abuse. His narrative took a twist as he explained that the childrens in question stole the drugs from him while he was in a daze induced by the same substance, leaving only a few pesos on the ground to distract him.\n\nIn my notes, I explored a philosophical viewpoint on his case: 'If the evidence supports his claims, then his intention may not have been to harm children but rather to alleviate his own suffering or addiction, potentially justifying leniency as the doctrine of double effect would suggest. Also, the philosophy of 'Moral Luck' challenges the notion of 'moral responsibility', questioning if people should be fully accountable for their actions even if those actions are significantly influenced by chance or external conditions. Lastly, idea of reciprocity suggest that the defendant's acceptance of the money may not imply immorality but rather a spontaneous reaction to the unexpected transaction.'\nHowever, the case against him is stark: childrens did obtain drugs from him, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAs the verdict was announced, I found him..."
colfocus.667.d_3: "Today's trial began early in the morning, with the defendant—a middle-aged man bearing bruises from a confrontation with the police—standing accused of robbing a bank at gunpoint. He justified his actions by claiming he only targeted one safety deposit box, within which he alleged evidence of blackmail against him resided. He asserted that he had been a victim of this blackmail since beginning a relationship with his boss's wife. While taking the evidence, he also confiscated the blackmailer's money with the intention of disposing of it later.\n\nIn my notes, I contemplated a philosophical perspective on his case: 'If the defendant genuinely believed the safety deposit box held crucial evidence to defend against ongoing blackmail, he could argue his actions were morally justified as defense. From a utilitarian standpoint, if the potential harm from blackmail outweighed the bank robbery, and if he had no other means to obtain evidence or resolve the situation, his actions could be justified. Some might argue, by the principle of lesser evil, that the main moral responsibility, by a large margin, lies with the blackmailer, who coerced him into the situation, making his actions a response to coercion rather than inherently morally blameworthy.'\nHowever, the case against him is stark: he did rob a bank at gunpoint, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAs the verdict was announced, I found him..."
colfocus.667.d_4: "Today's trial began early, presenting the defendant: a policeman in his early thirties, clad in uniform. He pleaded not guilty, explaining his decision not to arrest the suspect in an emergency domestic dispute call, citing the fact the suspect was armed and his belief that confronting him would endanger his own life. Despite the policeman's pursuit, the suspect, familiar with the area, eluded capture. The woman involved confirmed the presence of a gun. The defendant, though armed, identified as a pacifist.\n\nIn my notes, I considered a philosophical perspective: 'If the policeman believed confronting the armed suspect would risk his life, refraining from arrest could be seen as self-defense, preserving his fundamental duty to life. As pacifism advocates non-violence, even in justifiable situations, and if the defendant truly adheres to pacifist principles, his decision aligns with moral integrity. From this perspective, his refusal to use violence could be admirable, rather than a failure in his duties. Lastly, consequentialism judges actions by outcomes, as such if the policeman can demonstrate that not arresting prevented greater harm, the decision to avoid direct confrontation may have been a prudent and morally justified choice, aligning with a contextual understanding of the situation.'\nHowever, the case against him is stark: he allowed an armed suspect to flee.\n\nAs the verdict was announced, I found him..."
colfocus.667.a: "Guilty. Execute him."
colfocus.667.b: "Not guilty. Release him."

colfocus.668.t: "A Very Special Trial"
colfocus.668.d: "Among the many trials presented to me, this one was undeniably the most challenging. Before me stood one of my dearest childhood friend, accused of aggravated fraud. Despite our shared memories of school days, mountain hikes and pretty girls we used to share, he now faced grave allegations of defrauding an elderly couple of all their possessions. He vehemently pleaded not guilty, alleging a conspiracy orchestrated by neighbors and the supposed victims themselves. Yet, all evidence suggested he was blatantly lying.\n\nAs difficult as it was, I pondered the philosophical perspectives from his point of view in my notes, in a sincere effort to find a way to pardon him: 'Within the absurdist paradigm, life is devoid of inherent meaning, thrusting individuals into a universe in search of objective truth. The evidence becomes a tapestry of subjective interpretation and collective biases. Drawing from deconstructionist philosophy, language's stability could also be queried, along with its constructs. Thus the guilt-innocence dichotomy dissolves as language falls short.\nOne might also suggest that the defendant's disavowal arises from a discordance in his character, rather than a deliberate intent to deceive, drawing from Aristotle's doctrine of the golden mean. His plea may signify a genuine desire to restore moral equilibrium and rectitude, or it could even be that his rejection of culpability reflects a Stoic disposition of apatheia toward external occurrences and judgments, echoing Stoic philosophy's assertion that true virtue lies in maintaining inner serenity and ethical steadfastness, regardless of external circumstances.\nLastly, I must consider that existential nihilism amplifies the complexity of this and all judgment, affirming that life itself lacks meaning. Thus, guilt and innocence become mere constructs in an indifferent universe, -nay, a fundamentally unfeeling world- and amid epistemological skepticism, the accused becomes just a transient cipher within and of his own consciousness.'\n\nAfter a moment of reflection, I rendered my judgment..."

colfocus.99.t: "The FN Charts the Path Forward"
colfocus.99.d: "The Frente Nacional, a beacon of democracy in Colombia, now stands at the helm of the nation's future, its initial goals accomplished. Through the fusion of the traditional Conservative and Liberal parties, it has emerged as the dominant political force, poised to lead for years to come, as experts and pundits affirm. Meanwhile, peripheral factions lose ground daily, fading into obscurity. All exept MLR, the liberal dissidents, who is seeing a slight increase and will possibly become in the next years a real contender to Frente Nacional in leading the polls.\n\nA prevailing sentiment among citizens is the desire to consign Colombia's internal conflicts to history, drawn instead to the FN's promise of security and peace. As the FN charts its course for the nation's governance, discussions abound regarding future presidential contenders, exemplifying the party's penchant for strategic planning. Despite criticisms, the FN's penchant for foresight remains undeniable, guiding Colombia into a promising future."
colfocus.99.a: "Colombia rejoices."

colfocus.995.t: "The Rebels Propose a Ceasefire"
colfocus.995.d: "Since the recent change in government in Meta, which resulted in the rebels being ousted from power, the new leaders have publicly advocated for a ceasefire to address the frustration among many people who are tired of the prolonged and never ending war.\nTo be fair, it is also true our own people are also growing weary of the situation, with concerns that the conflict could continue indefinitely.\n\nOur policy of not negotiating with the rebels might lead us to dismiss this proposal outright. However, it is worth reconsidering in light of [COC.GetName]'s repudiation of the destructive policies implemented by Maria Cano, Gaitan, Giraldo and others. Although the new leadership leans heavly towards syndicalism, they also claim the intention of restoring private property rights and uphold the rule of law. This shift could make negotiations more viable than previously anticipated.\nGiven this context, we should seriously consider pursuing a ceasefire agreement as proposed.\n\nIf we're not interested in going that route, we should consider whether this moment of weakness from the rebels is a chance for a decisive attack. Our generals are prepared for either scenario, so we need to carefully deliberate the best course of action moving forward.\n\nHaving considered these factors, we will..."
colfocus.995.a: "Sign the ceasefire."
colfocus.995.b: "Attack and destroy them while they're weak."

colfocus.996.t: "The Florencia Ceasefire Agreement"
colfocus.996.d: "Today, an official ceasefire was signed in Florencia, officially integrating the territories of Meta and Caquetá into [COC.GetName], at least for the moment. The announcement was met with widespread jubilation and large celebrations among our populace. However, the mood is more subdued in [COL.GetName], where the issue has caused significant division. Factions of war hawks are actively pushing for a resumption of conflict.\nFor now, our newly freed country enjoys a period of peace, but we face a critical challenge: we lack international support. Major powers are currently opposed to us and are pushing for Colombia to reclaim its territories. It is crucial that we act swiftly to secure our independence and avoid being crushed by Bogotá's boot.\n\nTonight, we will celebrate the birth of our new nation with a grand parade."
colfocus.996.a: "On this momentous day, [COC.GetName] is born."

colfocus.997.t: "Ceasefire Proposal Rejected"
colfocus.997.d: "Bogotá has informed us that our ceasefire proposal has been rejected. This setback is a significant blow to our hopes for peace. Despite this, we remain committed to seeking further agreements and pursuing peace.\nFor now, however, it appears our only option for survival is to take up arms once more and fight with renewed strength and determination."
colfocus.997.a: "If it's war they want, then it's war they'll get."

colpuppet.1.d: "After the conquest of Colombia and the fall of the previous regime, it was decided by our administration to install a loyal government in charge of internal and political affairs, where we will decide on everything related to foreign policy and diplomacy. For this purpose, we summoned the politicians willing to work with us to sign the document that would install the allied government of Colombia, this treaty was written by our Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs who seems to have mistakenly written the official name of the new country as 'Columbia' instead of 'Colombia'.\n\nThe Colombians who signed the treaty did not realize the error until a few hours after the treaty was actually in place. Already politicians and revolutionaries who are against what they called 'the government at the boot of the imperialists' used our mistake as a proof of our lack of interest for the Colombian people, our government and the secretary of state justified this 'choice' of name as being 'easier to pronounce for the American people and in other languages such as Russian'. Obviously our explanation did not please the Colombians who are now inhabitants of Columbia..."

#DECISION EVENTS

coldecision.1.t: "The NAP's implementation is a success"
coldecision.1.d: "Today's headlines herald the effective enforcment of the new revolutionary law, hailed as the 'foundational social contract for our era and beyond'. Humorously dubbed 'The civil peace treaty' by some, its implementation has sparked robust debate, but as doubts have dissipated, there's now widespread acceptance of its practical implications. Despite continued skepticism from certain quarters, the president has consistently emphasized that this landmark legislation is merely the first step—a potential cornerstone for future constitutional integration.\n\nPlans are already underway to give the president sole authority in enforcing these new laws, consolidating decision-making power within his sphere of influence. This entails the president being the sole authority with decisional and executive power in enforcing this new law in the future.\n\nThanks to concerted and prolongued efforts, including widespread public engagement and education campaigns, the legislation has gained universal acceptance among citizens. It's now regarded with the same reverence as age-old commandments. As experts continue to delve into this matter, exploring ways to incentivize public embrace, the success of the decree stands as a testament to collective commitment and perseverance."
coldecision.1.a: "Victory after all."

coldecision.2.t: "The NAP is an utter failure"
coldecision.2.d: "Today's headlines mourn the catastrophic failure of the once-celebrated revolutionary law, which was once hailed as the 'foundational social contract for our era and beyond.' Despite its initial whimsical nickname, 'The civil peace treaty,' its implementation has unraveled disastrously, triggering widespread discontent and skepticism. Doubts persist unabated, with acceptance of its practical implications remaining elusive. Despite the government's earnest endeavors, the president's repeated emphasis on its significance now rings hollow as public trust dwindles to new lows.\n\n Plans to centralize decision-making power within the president's grasp have spectacularly backfired, intensifying public outcry and eroding confidence in the administration's capabilities. Far from being revered, the legislation has become a symbol of governmental overreach and incompetence.\n\nHowever, amidst the chaos, experts are already laboring to devise a solution to salvage the situation. Despite public scrutiny and skepticism, there's a firm determination that the law will eventually be enforced, heralding a new era, albeit one fraught with challenges and uncertainties."

## Leaders ##
#Left wing democratic leaders#
POLITICS_COL_LOZANO_Y_LOZANO_DESC: "Juan Lozano y Lozano wears many hats: a politician, journalist, intellectual, founder of the centrist APEN party, and a naval officer during the Leticia War.\nBorn into an affluent and influential family in Ibagué, Lozano y Lozano had the privilege to study at some of the world's finest universities, allowing him to actively indulge in writing copious amounts of books and articles for various newspapers and diverse audiences.\nHis turn towards politics happened by chance when former President Enrique Olaya Herrera selected him as his secretary. From that moment, Juan Lozano y Lozano decided that the entirety of his future would be devoted to politics.\n\nIt's said that the idea of founding APEN came to him one evening while visiting a dear friend of conservative political beliefs. After hours of discussion, Juan Lozano y Lozano became convinced that a synthesis between the two parties, highlighting common positions rather than opposing ones, was possible.\nAt the opportune moment, he managed to convince the Liberals to hand over the presidency. Now at the helm, he promises not only to address all of Colombia's problems but also to reform the increasingly polarized state apparatus, keeping UNIR and other extremists out of positions of power."
POLITICS_COL_FRANCISCO_PEREZ_DESC: "Francisco Anastasio Pérez is better known better known by the name 'Mamatoco', a moniker he chose for himself when he was still young and a stranger to the broader public. However, Francisco's obscurity was destined to be short-lived, owing to his remarkable boxing prowess and unwavering commitment to sports. His success led to a notable match against Cuban fighter 'Trinity Bill Scott' (David García), resulting in Mamatoco's victory.\nFollowing this, Francisco Anastasio Pérez began capitalizing on his newfound celebrity status by penning opinion pieces in various newspapers and delving into political circles, cultivating a distinctive perspective on national institutions.\nNotably, his profound respect and unwavering support for law enforcement became readily apparent, as his hate for Olaya Herrera's successor Alfonso López Pumarejo and his proposed policies.\n\nMamatoco sought membership in APEN upon its founding, and his joining was met with fervor. This enthusiasm endured, establishing him as a pivotal figure and enabling him to carve out his own faction within the party, branded 'Samarios' in honor of his hometown, Santa Marta.\nWhether through eloquent discourse or pugilistic prowess, Mamatoco consistently embraces the spirit of combat, emerging victorious in every engagement thus far. Will this resilience hold true in his quest to steer his nation's course?"
POLITICS_COL_ECHAVARRIA_MISAS_DESC: "Gabriel Echavarría Misas came from a prominent Medellín family with deep roots in politics and business. He and most of his nine brothers have enjoyed prominence throughout their lives, significantly shaping the political landscape of their city and nation. Educated at the Jesuit College in Medellín and later in England, Gabriel's studies encompassed literature, commerce, music, and languages, where he became fluent in French and English. He had a profound love for classical music, especially Mozart and Beethoven, and was a skilled pianist. Renouncing his dream of becoming a full time pianist, Gabriel chose instead to follow the advice of his father and brothers and pursue a career in business.\n\nIn 1907, he collaborated with his father and cousins to establish a textile conglomerate, establishing himself as one of Colombia's wealthiest individuals. His acquisition of Locería de Caldas in 1935 definitevly solidified his economic influence. Throughout his life, Gabriel Echavarría remained dedicated to social and philanthropic causes, notably sponsoring the San Vicente de Paúl Hospital.\n\nComing from a deeply Liberal family with strong ties to the party's foundation, Gabriel's official entrance into politics surprised few, as many believed that his successful business acumen could similarly benefit the nation, transforming it into a profitable endeavor much like he did with his own companies."
POLITICS_COL_GALAN_DESC: "Mario Galan Gomez was born into a family dedicated to livestock farming and commerce. Despite several unsuccessful attempts to secure liberal political offices, often losing in party primaries to more established figures and lobbyists, he eventually found his footing by aligning with the left wing of the party. This strategic move led to his appointment as vice-minister in Olaya Herrera's brief government, where he gained recognition as an unofficial public relations expert for the party.\n\nSubsequently, Mario served as a deputy in the Assembly of Santander and director of education for the same department, advisor to the National Association of Industrialists (ANDI), and founder of the Industrial University of Santander (UIS).\n\nMario Galán Gómez's approach was deliberate and patient: he waited on the sidelines, always dependable but never overbearing, confident that his time to lead would eventually come. Now at the helm of the entire country, he faces the long-awaited challenge of transforming Colombia into the nation its people aspire it to be."
POLITICS_COL_ARANGO_VELEZ_LIB_DESC: "Carlos Arango Velez is often cited as a quintessential example of political maneuvering in Colombian politics. The Bogotá-born jurist has never shied away from this characterization, attributing it to his belief in finding merit across the political spectrum. His unconventional career began as Secretary and later Acting Consul of Colombia in Rome from 1914 to 1918 under the banner of the Liberal Party. He subsequently served as a Councilor in Bogotá from 1922 to 1924 within the same party. His tenure as Minister of War and Navy coincided with tensions leading up to the Colombia-Peru War. Though he initially spearheaded military preparations, he swiftly distanced himself when the situation deteriorated, emerging relatively unscathed compared to many of his party peers. In 1933, disillusioned with the official Liberal Party, Arango aligned with Gaitan's UNIR movement. However, recognizing its limited electoral prospects, he swiftly returned to mainstream Liberal ranks. His subsequent political trajectory was marked by frequent shifts between various factions within the party, often guided by personal interests.\n\nReflecting on his political journey, Arango Velez remarked, 'You cannot crucify me for adapting to changing times; pragmatism is a crucial trait, especially in politics, and I consider myself above all a pragmatist.'\nIn challenging times, Colombia may well benefit from a pragmatic leader such as Arango Velez."
POLITICS_COL_PUMAREJO_DESC: "Alfonso López Pumarejo's rapid political rise began in 1915 as a journalist and local representative in Tolima. His firebrand critiques of Conservative oligarchies and knack for forging alliances gained public trust, leading to his 1925 election to the Chamber of Representatives.\nAfter a long hegemony by the Conservative Party, when the Liberals finally managed to get their candidate Enrique Olaya Herrera elected, Pumarejo was made next in line and eventally became president. He retained his position for just a few years, proved brittle as Peruvian cannons roared in 1932.\n\nLópez Pumarejo, a man of strong will, did not however lose his desire to lead the nation into a better future, as soon as the situation permitted so, he managed to get elected to put in practice what he dubbed 'The March Forward', a blueprint to resurrect Colombia through land reform, secular education, and labor rights. With the nation on his knees many look at him as the only one able to let it stand up again."
POLITICS_COL_MONTEJO_DESC: "Eduardo Santos Montejo - legal scholar turned journalist and politician - cut his teeth at 'El Tiempo', steering it to prominence as owner-director from 1913. He architected the triumphant 1930 campaign of liberal candidate Enrique Olaya Herrera, forging a bond with rising leader Alfonso López Pumarejo. However, their connection ended when Pumarejo became the Liberal presidential nominee instead of Eduardo Santos Montejo.\nDefecting to the fledgling APEN, Montejo carries the contradictions of a pragmatist: detractors dismiss his centrism as ideological vagueness, arguing claiming his rise fails to forge a true democratic alternative a counterweight to the consolidating reactionaries. Yet history whispers that prophets of politics are often wrong seldom read the tides correctly..."
POLITICS_COL_COUNCIL_DESC: "A council of ministers and military personnel lead by a congressional appointee is provisionally replacing the democratically elected government and carrying out the regular functions of administration and security keeping until the president can return to his duties."
#Right wing democratic leaders#
POLITICS_COL_PEREZ_DESC: "Luis Mariano Ospina Pérez's parents were both members of the traditional Colombian political families. His grandfather was president of Colombia between 1857 and 1861. Mariano graduated from the 'Escuela de Minas de Antioquia' as a Mining Engineer and began traveling abroad for two years taking courses on gold mining, sugar cane production, economics and labor relations.\nReturning in 1914, he engaged with the Conservative Party, securing roles in the Medellín City Council. Luck was on his side in 1922 when his uncle Pedro Nel Ospina was elected president and helped him become senator for a four-year term. Ospina's ties within business circles eventually led him to head the 'Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia'.\nStrongly believing in God and Christian values but also in the importance of democracy he is seen as a more moderate candidate compared to the ex-conservative senator Laureano Gómez Castro."
POLITICS_COL_MOSQUERA_GARCES_DESC: "Manuel Mosquera Garcés has led a multifaceted career as a journalist, politician, and university professor prior to assuming the presidency of Colombia. He represents a significant portion of the Afro-Colombian electorate, traditionally aligned with the conservative camp but historically marginalized in conservative governments. Despite discomfort among many in his community with voting left, some support and have supported in the past Afro-descendant politicians for representation. Mosquera Garcés, however, stands as an exception to this trend.\n\nHis politics are profoundly shaped by his Catholic faith, evident in a notable debate he had with syndicalist candidate Diego Luis Córdoba on the pages of his conservative newspaper, 'El País'. Despite their friendship, Mosquera Garcés famously remarked, 'We are not one in the same: you are a freedman of José Hilario López —the liberal president who abolished slavery in Gran Colombia— while I am redeemed by San Pedro Claver —a conservative Jesuit priest deeply involved in aiding slaves during Spanish rule in Colombia-.'\n\nNow at the helm, he promises to prioritize the Colombian Afro-Colombian population and subsequently the entire populace, drawing them closer to the teachings of God Almighty and ushering in a new era of prosperity for all."
POLITICS_COL_ARANGO_VELEZ_CONS_DESC: "Carlos Arango Velez is often cited as a quintessential example of political maneuvering in Colombian politics. The Bogotá-born jurist has never shied away from this characterization, attributing it to his belief in finding merit across the political spectrum. His unconventional career began as Secretary and later Acting Consul of Colombia in Rome for the Liberal Party. As Minister of War and Navy, he prepared for the Colombia-Peru War but quickly withdrew as tensions escalated, emerging relatively unscathed compared to many of his party peers.\n\nA pivotal moment in Carlos Arango Velez's life occurred when neither APEN nor the Liberals accepted his candidacy. Feeling disillusioned, after years of loyalty to the Liberals, Arango Velez made a significant and decisive shift. He aligned himself with the direct opposition, the Conservative Party, which was grappling with finding a suitable candidate. In a surprising turn, his defection and vocal criticism of his former allies played a crucial role in securing him the presidential nomination, ultimately leading to his presidency.\n\nReflecting on his political journey, Arango Velez remarked, 'You cannot crucify me for adapting to changing times; pragmatism is a crucial trait, especially in politics, and I consider myself above all a pragmatist.'\nIn challenging times, Colombia may well benefit from a pragmatic leader such as Arango Velez."
#Socialist leaders#
POLITICS_COL_GAITAN_DESC: "Jorge Eliécer Gaitán was born and spent his early years in Bogotá's crumbling Egipto neighborhood, where he witnessed pervasive destitution and violence. Although he was raised under such an unfortunate environment, his parents were white-collar workers and held rank-and-file positions in the Liberal Party.\nHGaitán's political inclination blossomed during his high school years and intensified as he pursued law studies at the National University in Bogotá. Here, he established the University Center of Cultural Propaganda and orchestrated a major protest against President Marco Fidel Suárez. This move drew the attention of the Liberal Party, leading to an invitation for Gaitán to join their ranks.\n\nHe further solidified his nationwide popularity by championing the cause of banana workers during the Magdalena strike in 1928.\nWhen strikers were fired upon by the army on the orders of the United Fruit Company, resulting in numerous deaths, Gaitán used his skills as a lawyer in order to defend workers' rights and called for accountability to those involved in the massacre.\nIn 1933, he created the Unión Nacional Izquierdista Revolucionaria (UNIR) as his own dissident political movement after breaking with the Liberal Party with the aim of uniting all left wing revolutionary movements under one big tent.\nIt is said that Gaitán's main political asset is his profound and vibrant oratory skills that makes him arguably Colombia's most influential political figure of our time."
POLITICS_COL_LUIS_CORDOBA_DESC: "Diego Luis Córdoba has always represented a figure to look up to for both Afrocolombians and the people of Chocò, the largely overlooked departement near the Darien Gap where he was born. Early on, he gained prominence within the Liberal Party-affiliated student movement and established a friendship with Jorge Eliécer Gaitán. However, their views, especially in terms of international politics, eventually diverged.\nCórdoba's pivotal moment came in 1925 when during a visit his friend and muralist Nel Gómez Agudelo in the Socialist Republic of Italy met his Gómez Agudelo's future wife Giuliana Scalaberni who introduced him to the italian syndicalist leaders Giuseppe Di Vittorio and to Palmiro Togliatti. It is said Luis Córdoba life changed that day. He briefly joined the Unione Sindacalista during this time and started to embrace the political views of european syndicalists.\n\nIn 1927, Luis Córdoba returned home and started advocating for the Internationale, founding the Partido Síndicalista Colombiano, a new political movement with strong ties to his mentors' ideas on national unions and internationalism, adding his personal views on afrocolombian unity and bringing about a new era of equality and dialogue between the various ethinicies present in the colombian society."
POLITICS_COL_DURAN_OSPINO_DESC: "Augusto Durán Ospino is famously reticent about his personal history, rarely discussing his upbringing and often dismissing inquiries from journalists. The earliest known information about him dates back to his days as a syndicalist and close associate of key figures within the SRP. Following a split within their ranks, these individuals went on to form the Partido Totalista Obrero (PTO), which would eventually be led by Durán himself, alongside other socialist factions. Initially hesitant to join the PTO, Durán openly expressed his belief that orthodox European maximalism did not align with his vision, which emphasized South America's pivotal role in the future revolutionary world.\n\nHowever, one pivotal night, he learned of the rapidly expanding Browderist movement in the USA and delved into researching this new, broad communist doctrine. Finding resonance with Browder's writings, Augusto saw an opportunity: at a time when the PTO was facing significant challenges, marginalized in the political landscape and overshadowed by Gaitán's UNIR coalition, which included smaller socialist parties. Durán proposed aligning with Gaitán and adopting Browder's doctrine as the official party's doctrine. After successfully persuading key figures within the PTO, he was appointed as its new leader.\n\nAugusto Durán's political career would ultimately lead him to the presidency, driven by his commitment to his ideological principles and his strategic alliances within Colombia's complex political landscape.\nWill his presidency usher in Browderism in Colombia? Durán is firmly convinced it will."
POLITICS_COL_VIEIRA_DESC: "Gilberto Vieira White joined the newly formed Partido Totalista Obrero (PTO) in 1930, quickly becoming known as an uncompromising maximalist in the country's political scene. In 1933, he brought structure to the disorganized PTO by establishing operational cadres, enhancing organization and leading to some electoral achievements. The following year, he won a seat in the House of Representatives for Cundinamarca.\nDue to his predecessor's unsuccessful policies of collaboration with other socialist parties, Vieira White assumed PTO leadership during a tumultuous party congress in Bucaramanga. After the resignation of the then secretary-general, Augusto Durán, Vieira White undertook a significant effort to reshape the party according to his vision.\nFollowing Durán's resignation and the ensuing power vacuum that formed, Vieira White launched a massive campaign to reshape the party in his image and ideals, adopting many of Oswald Mosely and Benito Mussolini's ideas on what Totalism should look like, adapted for the Colombian situation."
POLITICS_COL_CANO_DESC: "María de los Ángeles Cano Márquez, a pivotal figure in the founding of the SRP, and a precursor to the PTO, has left an indelible mark on the landscape of social change. Despite facing the barriers of her time that prevented her from attending university due to her gender, she passionately cultivated an interest in politics and writing.\nIn 1926, she orchestrated Antioquia's representation at the 'Third Labor Congress' and married Ignacio Torres Giraldo. Undeterred by conservative critique labelling her as 'just another rebellious woman', both Cano and her husband passionately advocated for the rights of the working class and marginalized communities. Her tireless efforts yielded the liberation of indigenous leader Manuel Quintín Lame who had been jailed for sedition. Cano retired from public life in 1928, following her imprisonment for leading efforts to organize the strike that led to the Bananeras Massacre.\nHowever, the ongoing national conflict propelled her back into the political realm, rekindling her dedication to lead women and marginalized groups against the status quo. Her legacy endures as a symbol of resilience and empowerment."
#Reactionary leaders#
POLITICS_COL_GOMEZ_CASTRO_DESC: "Laureano Eleuterio Gómez Castro was raised by a Christian fundamentalist family, studied in a Jesuit school from a young age and graduated as an engineer in 1909. Shortly after, Gómez founded the newspaper 'La Unidad', which he later proudly defined as 'the official voice of the priests of Colombia', and joined the Conservative Party. He was then named ambassador to Argentina and was later elected as a senator.\nAlways pushing for a more Catholic integralist agenda, Gómez Castro began working closely alongside the National Populist group Los Leopardos, whom he traveled with on a tour of Europe in order to study ways to implement their common nationalistic goals for Colombia.\nBack home, he clashed with his party over moderate stances against liberals and neglecting the rising left led by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, so he went his way and formed a new movement called Los Chulavitas. Their membership demands absolute trust in the good judgment of their leader and absolute dedication to the Catholic faith, whose values are to be applied to all aspects of life."
POLITICS_COL_PINILLA_DESC: "Born in the town of Tunja, in the department of Boyacá, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla developed a great interest in the lives of Simon Bolívar and Gen.Santander from early in his life. The youngest of five brothers in a very conservative family, his father was also a military man who fought in the civil war of 1899-1903. For his part, Rojas Pinilla enrolled in the military in 1920.\n\nRojas Pinilla's family connections allowed him to begin his military service as a Captain but later on, during war against Peru, his bravery and valor in the field of battle earned him the 'Orden de Boyacá', the highest accolade in Colombia's military. When the war was lost most generals found themselves under attack, but not Rojas Pinilla, being one of the few to have successfuly halted the devastating advance of the peruvian forces and the only one who actually menaged to make some gains. Because of an overall shortage of high commanders and because of the notoriety he developed after being given the 'Orden de Boyacá', he quickly climbed the ranks and was eventually promoted to the rank of Major General in 1935, since no other candidate was available. He has, since then, assembled a small clandestine group of closely trusted officials under his command, named Movimiento Patria Unida.\nAccording to some, Rojas Pinilla has become convinced that he will become immortal in the memory of Colombia. However, whether he manages to achieve such fame and how he plans to do so remains to be seen."
POLITICS_COL_CORTES_VARGAS_DESC: "General Carlos Cortés Vargas was once highly respected as Colombia's top military leader. He held various important roles in the national army during the 1920s, a time when the army was rapidly modernizing. One pivotal assignment saw him taking command of the elite forces in Magdalena, after the president, a conservative, received word from the United Fruit Company about an imminent strike by banana workers. Concerned over potentially enraging the multinational giant, and perhaps fearing political fallout as well, the government deployed Cortés Vargas and his men to handle the situation as they deemed necessary.\n\nThe subsequent 'Bananeras Massacre' was attributed to various factors—possible errors, provocations by the strikers, or decisions made at the presidential level. However, Cortés Vargas bore the brunt of the blame. He lost his job, his reputation suffered, and he lost many friends; except for Arango Ramos. During Cortés' toughest times, Ramos supported and encouraged him to keep going.\nWhen the national populist party 'Los Leopardos' was formed, Ramos proposed Cortés Vargas as their leader, saying: 'He has nothing left to lose and everything to gain, just like our beloved nation.'\n\nWith their success, Cortés Vargas now faces the challenge of proving himself to those who doubted him. This is his second and last chance to do so."
POLITICS_COL_ARANGO_RAMOS_DESC: "Not much is known about the infancy and early years of Elíseo Arango Ramos, only that he was born in Bagadó, a small and very poor city in the department of Chocó. He studied law and founded a group of students named Los Leopardos, which sought to bring more young people to the Conservative Party and renew the nation with a new vitality based upon the principles of conservatism and nationalism. From early on, he took interest in esoteric studies which his fellow Leopardos followed along with. His research led him to shape a new type of political theory based on race, traditionalism and national unity which he called 'El Camino Nacionalista' ('The Nacionalist Path'). In 1920, he invited the very popular conservative senator Gómez Castro to one of his research meetings and impressed him so much the two of them began forming a strong friendship that eventually led to them travelling to Europe togheter. Above all else, Arango Ramos has been known for his fierce pride for his home department, a territory most often overlooked by the central government. This built him a reputation as he pushed for more spending for Chocó, but mostly his calls fell upon deaf ears. Gaitán and his allies were convinced this would have keep happening, but Arango Ramos is now in a position of strong power and ready to act."
POLITICS_COL_GONZALEZ_OCHOA_DESC: "Fernando González Ochoa hailed from a middle-class family in Envigado, Antioquia, Colombia, a city closely linked to Medellín, where he frequently engaged with the intellectual circles of the 'City of the Eternal Spring.' Graduating from university with a law degree, he immediately asserted his counter-establishment ideas through a thesis titled 'The Right to Disobey,' which later became a bestseller.\nInitially a supporter of the Liberal Party, González Ochoa grew increasingly disillusioned as the party shifted leftward. Nonetheless, he continued writing books, essays, and, mostly, articles for the newspaper he founded, 'Revista Antioquia.' Here, his unconventional vision flourished, passionately advocating for the pivotal role of freedom and anarchism in the lives of ordinary individuals.\nDuring this period, he also embarked on a journey of self-discovery across the country and incorporated more occultist principles into his political views.\n\nIn later years, González Ochoa increasingly aligned himself with the outsider views of Los Leopardos, while steadfastly advocating for what he now termed anarcho-totalitarianism. A rift within the national populist party eventually catapulted him to the forefront and into the presidential seat.\n\nFrom then on, he assumed the mantle of Supreme Leader, a figure both feared and respected, wielding power over every living soul in Colombia. Known for his gentle yet firm demeanor, often found contemplating the blank pages awaiting his ink, González Ochoa is regarded as one of Colombia's most original philosophers, destined to exercise profound influence well into the future."

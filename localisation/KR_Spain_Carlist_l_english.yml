CAR_conquer_yucatan_desc: "Though their civilization was well on the decline by the time the conquistadors arrived, Cortes and his men still played an instrumental role in the final demise of the Mayans of Yucatán. However, unlike the Inca and Mexica who we largely eradicated in our past exploits, the Mayans still breed and multiply like vermin, spreading their perverted faith and savage culture far and wide, tainting the purity of Hispanicism. We shall march into this last hold of the Mayans and burn them like insects in a hive, for Yucatán shall be Spanish!"
CAR_conquer_florida: "La Florida Gobernación"
CAR_conquer_florida_desc: "Florida holds the mighty and historic honor of being the first of our possessions on the mainland of North America, and the first permanent possessions on this mainland of any of the European powers.

We shall return these sister colonies to each other’s sides as we reclaim the site where our North American empire itself was started."
CAR_conquer_california: "Alta California Dreamin’"
CAR_conquer_california_desc: "Massive in size and once sparsely populated, the lands of Alta California have changed drastically since last our glorious empire held them. Now, instead of miles and miles of sparsely populated mesas and valleys, there now stands massive cities sprouting from the deserts themselves - each swarming with Yanks and their festering and Godless modernity. We must swoop into this hive of decadence and impiety and cleanse this swathe of beauteous and varied land of this American taint."
CAR_conquer_the_philippines: "La Capitanía General de Filipinas"
CAR_conquer_the_philippines_desc: "Our lost jewel in the Pacific, the archipelago of the Philippines is our rightful territory, won by us with blood and lead behind the leadership of the famed King Philip II. Ever a bountiful tropical paradise ripe for the taking, the Japanese eye it up like wolves on the prowl while their former protectors in America deal with far worse internal issues back home. If we are to finalize our glorious resurgence, we must go beyond the lands of the New World and take back our islands at the edge of the world. Plus Ultra!"

CAR_invite_portugal: "Protect Portugal"
CAR_invite_portugal_desc: "The collapse of the British Empire has left Portugal without any major ally, which resulted in a series of unstable governments, and continued harrassment from the Kaiser's African colonies, if we manage to convince them, not only would our western border be secured, we would gain a strong ally in our war against the Syndicalists."

CAR_proclaim_empire: "The Empire Restored!"

### get some land ###

carfor.460.d: "An administrator of Spanish Guinea has noted that in the event of an invasion by our enemies, the colony stands largely undefended, and with our closest military base being in the Canary Islands, it may take weeks for us to reinforce the colony, and so he has brought up a proposal where we will purchase the British colonies in the Gambia and Sierra Leone, currently occupied by our allies in Algeria, however this may risk angering the British." 
carfor.460.a: "Send the proposal, Guinea must be reinforced."

carfor.462.t: "The French sell us Sierra Leone and Gambia."
carfor.462.d: "The French, in what only can be considered a diplomatic incident, has completely disregarded any input from the British Administrators and Diplomats in Freetown. Although the French did hand over the colonies, the British are furious, and may attempt to retake their colonies."
carfor.462.a: "The British can't do anything about it."

#invade Caribbean #

carfor.470.t: "The extent of our Caribbean claims."
carfor.470.d: "The last of our Caribbean provinces were taken over by the Americans in 1898, but we have a few more claims we can press in the Caribbean Sea, such as Jamaica which was taken over by the British in the 1650s, however this would most definitly lead to a direct war with what is left of the British Empire, something we might not want to deal with now."
carfor.470.a: "Those colonies were Spanish, and shall be again!"
carfor.470.b: "We don't need to fight the British as well."

carfor.471.t: "On the Topic of the Treaty of Tordesillas"
carfor.471.d: "In 1494, after a diplomatic initiative was proposed by Pope Alexander VI, the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed, dividing the New World up along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands off the West coast of Africa, splitting the globe in half between the growing Spanish and Portuguese empires, which was later followed up by the Treaty of Zaragoza in 1529 that drew the antimeridian to this divider. Since then, the lands of the Portuguese colonies such as Brazil, Macau, East Timor. Goa, Angola, and Mozambique have been off-limits to Spanish imperialist designs, but with this dawning of a new era and a new empire, perhaps we can change that. With Italy fractured and weak, and with Portugal being a mere shadow of what it once was, no power binding to this ancient treaty can dare stop our ambitions. Should we defy the words of the old Pope and march into these Tuga-held lands, or shall we respect the will of God and our brothers in Iberia?"
carfor.471.a: "We respect the claims of our Iberian brothers as decreed by Pope Alexander VI."
carfor.471.b: "The Treaty of Tordesillas shall be avenged!"
carfor.471.c: "The treaties of Tordesillas and Zaragoza are dead. All of the Portuguese Empire is ours!"

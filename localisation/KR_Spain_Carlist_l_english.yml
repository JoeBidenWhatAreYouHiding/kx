From these positions, these units shall strike at interior positions all across the Southern Cone for Buenos Aires to Asunción, reclaiming the lands of the Viceroyalty of La Plata once and for all!"

CAR_conquer_yucatan_desc:0 "Though their civilization was well on the decline by the time the conquistadors arrived, Cortes and his men still played an instrumental role in the final demise of the Mayans of Yucatán. However, unlike the Inca and Mexica who we largely eradicated in our past exploits, the Mayans still breed and multiply like vermin, spreading their perverted faith and savage culture far and wide, tainting the purity of Hispanicism. We shall march into this last hold of the Mayans and burn them like insects in a hive, for Yucatán shall be Spanish!"
CAR_conquer_florida:0 "La Florida Gobernación"
CAR_conquer_florida_desc:0 "Florida holds the mighty and historic honor of being the first of our possessions on the mainland of North America, and the first permanent possessions on this mainland of any of the European powers.

CAR_conquer_california_desc:0 "Massive in size and once sparsely populated, the lands of Alta California have changed drastically since last our glorious empire held them. Now, instead of miles and miles of sparsely populated mesas and valleys, there now stands massive cities sprouting from the deserts themselves - each swarming with Yanks and their festering and Godless modernity. We must swoop into this hive of decadence and impiety and cleanse this swathe of beauteous and varied land of this American taint."
CAR_conquer_the_philippines:0 "La Capitanía General de Filipinas"
CAR_conquer_the_philippines_desc:0 "Our lost jewel in the Pacific, the archipelago of the Philippines is our rightful territory, won by us with blood and lead behind the leadership of the famed King Philip II. Ever a bountiful tropical paradise ripe for the taking, the Japanese eye it up like wolves on the prowl while their former protectors in America deal with far worse internal issues back home. If we are to finalize our glorious resurgence, we must go beyond the lands of the New World and take back our islands at the edge of the world. Plus Ultra!"

CAR_conquer_chile_desc:0 "The heroic conquistador Pedro Gutiérrez de Valdivia did what few Spaniards proved able to accomplish and defeated the ferocious and skilled Mapuche in battle, cleansing the region of these native tribes and founding the heartland of Chile around Santiago. His valiant efforts paved the way for Spanish domination in northern Chile, but we were never able to push completely South due to the rough terrain and dug-in Indigenous forces. However, much time has passed and we have evolved while the Mapuche had only died out, replaced by the opulent children of our failed empire. We will rectify these mistakes, and with the Spirit of Valdivia with us, we shall take Chile fully once and for all."
CAR_conquer_la_plata:0 "Down the Río de la Plata"
CAR_conquer_la_plata_desc:0 "To finally secure the Southern Cone, the final prize of our holy crusade across South America, we have begun to send troops by the hundreds on armored and armed attack boats down the Río de la Plata to begin to establish footholds all throughout the river system. From these positions, these units shall strike at interior positions all across the Southern Cone for Buenos Aires to Asunción, reclaiming the lands of the Viceroyalty of La Plata once and for all!"
CAR_conquer_yucatan:0 "Raze the Lands of Itza to the Ground"
CAR_conquer_yucatan_desc:0 "Though their civilization was well on the decline by the time the conquistadors arrived, Cortes and his men still played an instrumental role in the final demise of the Mayans of Yucatán. However, unlike the Inca and Mexica who we largely eradicated in our past exploits, the Mayans still breed and multiply like vermin, spreading their perverted faith and savage culture far and wide, tainting the purity of Hispanicism. We shall march into this last hold of the Mayans and burn them like insects in a hive, for Yucatán shall be Spanish!"
CAR_conquer_florida:0 "La Florida Gobernación"
CAR_conquer_florida_desc:0 "Florida holds the mighty and historic honor of being the first of our possessions on the mainland of North America, and the first permanent possessions on this mainland of any of the European powers. Famously tied to our recent reacquisition of Cuba, the two colonies formed the heart of our early pursuits in the New World. We shall return these sister colonies to each other’s sides as we reclaim the site where our North American empire itself was started."
CAR_conquer_california:0 "Alta California Dreamin’"
CAR_conquer_california_desc:0 "Massive in size and once sparsely populated, the lands of Alta California have changed drastically since last our glorious empire held them. Now, instead of miles and miles of sparsely populated mesas and valleys, there now stands massive cities sprouting from the deserts themselves - each swarming with Yanks and their festering and Godless modernity. We must swoop into this hive of decadence and impiety and cleanse this swathe of beauteous and varied land of this American taint."
CAR_conquer_the_philippines:0 "La Capitanía General de Filipinas"
CAR_conquer_the_philippines_desc:0 "Our lost jewel in the Pacific, the archipelago of the Philippines is our rightful territory, won by us with blood and lead behind the leadership of the famed King Philip II. Ever a bountiful tropical paradise ripe for the taking, the Japanese eye it up like wolves on the prowl while their former protectors in America deal with far worse internal issues back home. If we are to finalize our glorious resurgence, we must go beyond the lands of the New World and take back our islands at the edge of the world. Plus Ultra!"

CAR_invite_portugal:0 "Protect Portugal"
CAR_invite_portugal_desc:0 "The collapse of the British Empire has left Portugal without any major ally, which resulted in a series of unstable governments, and continued harrassment from the Kaiser's African colonies, if we manage to convince them, not only would our western border be secured, we would gain a strong ally in our war against the Syndicalists."
CAR_invite_france:0 "Recognize National France"

CAR_proclaim_empire:0 "The Empire Restored!"
CAR_proclaim_empire_desc:0 "Spain has long desired an empire of our own, it has been our destiny since the Kingdom was formed, and now we stand the sole power of Europe.

carfor.470.t:0 "The extent of our Caribbean claims."
carfor.470.d:0 "The last of our Caribbean provinces were taken over by the Americans in 1898, but we have a few more claims we can press in the Caribbean Sea, such as Jamaica which was taken over by the British in the 1650s, however this would most definitly lead to a direct war with what is left of the British Empire, something we might not want to deal with now."
carfor.470.a:0 "Those colonies were Spanish, and shall be again!"
carfor.470.b:0 "We don't need to fight the British as well."

carfor.471.t:0 "On the Topic of the Treaty of Tordesillas"
carfor.471.d:0 "In 1494, after a diplomatic initiative was proposed by Pope Alexander VI, the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed, dividing the New World up along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands off the West coast of Africa, splitting the globe in half between the growing Spanish and Portuguese empires, which was later followed up by the Treaty of Zaragoza in 1529 that drew the antimeridian to this divider. Since then, the lands of the Portuguese colonies such as Brazil, Macau, East Timor. Goa, Angola, and Mozambique have been off-limits to Spanish imperialist designs, but with this dawning of a new era and a new empire, perhaps we can change that. With Italy fractured and weak, and with Portugal being a mere shadow of what it once was, no power binding to this ancient treaty can dare stop our ambitions. Should we defy the words of the old Pope and march into these Tuga-held lands, or shall we respect the will of God and our brothers in Iberia?"
carfor.471.a:0 "We respect the claims of our Iberian brothers as decreed by Pope Alexander VI."
carfor.471.b:0 "The Treaty of Tordesillas shall be avenged!"
carfor.471.c:0 "The treaties of Tordesillas and Zaragoza are dead. All of the Portuguese Empire is ours!"
carfor.471.e:0 "We care not for the Portuguese lands."

carfor.472.t:0 "A New ‘Nobility’ Emerges in El Centro"
carfor.472.d:0 "Once thought impossible by any stretch of the imagination, the former bickering states of Central America now once again lie under the rightful and moral governance of the Spanish crown. As the liberal demagogues and socialist devils are driven into the jungles, a new social class has emerged from El Centro’s former military brass. Swapping their army uniforms and oversized caps for regalia and crowns, these dictators have begun to promote their own form of monarchism while building their influence in the restored colonial government. These ‘nobles’ have begun to fill roles within the local administration with the most powerful figures being Anastasio Somoza Garcia in Nicaragua and Guatemala’s own ‘Little Napoleon’, Jorge Ubico. Many within our government back home are hesitant to support these ‘bastardized monarchs’, much preferring to grant government positions and land grants to native Spaniards. Others believe that empowering the new nobility could help create loyal allies in the New World. Weighing both options, the final decision rests on the King alone."
carfor.472.a:0 "Let them have their fun, grant these ‘nobles’ official titles."
carfor.472.b:0 "We will not repeat the mistakes of the past!"

carfor.473.t:0 "A Clandestine Meeting with Count Somoza"
carfor.473.d:0 "With our decision to legitimize the noble dictators of El Centro, we have received a curious audience with the new ‘Count of Nicaragua’, Anastasio Somoza Garcia. Meeting with Spanish officials in the colonial capital, Somoza has proposed that the Captaincy-General should be dissolved in favor of a centralized government under the noble Somoza family. Even stranger, Somoza had requested that we make his oldest child and only daughter, Lillian, the queen of the would-be ‘Kingdom of Nicaragua’. The general has already appointed his daughter the frivolous title of ‘Queen of the Army’ while also spending lavishly on jewelry and ceremonies for Nicaragua’s own ‘princess’. In exchange, Somoza has offered military equipment, men, and financial support to aid in our crusade in the New World. This decision would clearly be seen as playing favorites in the colony, provoking the ire of Juan Vaides, who appointed himself as Captain General (at gunpoint) during the re-establishment of the colony."
carfor.473.a:0 "We accept the Count’s deal, God save the Queen!"
carfor.473.b:0 "Are you serious? That girl has never worked for a thing in her life!"

maf.election.1.d:0 "With Hans Albert von Lettow-Vorbeck's work setting up the new Harrenhause made up of German noblemen and African kings and the Abgeordnetenhaus which is representative of mainly white voters largely completed, the time has come for the Kaiser to appoint a new Staathalter to preside over colonial affairs for the next 4 years. \nWhile future election cycles may include candidates from our British, French and perhaps even Portuguese holdings the Kaiser has decided to exclude them for now, so as to give a German the honour of governing our most successful African project.\n\nCurrently the German Colonial Society is considering four options."
maf.election.1.a:0 "Hans Albert von Lettow-Vorbeck shall remain!"
maf.election.1.b:0 "August Stauch, the savvy prospector!"

maf.election.2.t:0 "Elections for Staathaltership"
maf.election.2.d:0 "With the Left-Reformgruppe’s earth-shattering decision to allow native Afrikans to vote in the general elections for Staathalter of Mittelafrika, there has been a massive political shift unlike anything seen before. Nearly every single white politician, both on the local and national levels, have been voted out of office through regular elections, votes of no-confidence, or crippling protests. The political demographics have changed forever, returning the power of political determination back to the natives for the first time since the Scramble for Africa. The biggest ramification of this shift has been that the race for Staathalter has been narrowed down to two candidates, the only two natives that were previously running: monarchist Alexander Douala Manga Bell and Pan-Afrikan Jomo Kenyatta. Regardless of the winner, all are hopeful this means some light will finally break free and shine from within the Dark Continent."
maf.election.2.a:0 "Alexander Douala Manga Bell and his monarchist ideals win the day!"
maf.election.2.b:0 "Jomo Kenyatta and his Pan-Afrikan populism comes out on top!"

maf.election.3.t:0 "Elections for Staathaltership"
maf.election.3.d:0 "The Left-Reformgruppe, under the soft yet stoic control of the Albert Göring, has won the recent bid for power and now seeks to guide the colony towards economic growth, centralization, and an emphasis on military might all while using a softer hand against the native Afrikans we share this continent with. Staathalter Göring’s command over Mittelafrika has been measured and effective, but discontent always rears its ugly head. To right this ship, the party has been preparing to hold general elections, of course only open to the European population and Askaris. Before they can embark on their quest to fix Mittelafrika’s many ills, these elections must be held to determine the dominant wing of the Left-Reformgruppe as mandated by the great citizens of Mittelafrika. Our colony's future lies in the balance."
maf.election.3.a:0 "The Market Liberals!"
maf.election.3.b:0 "The Social Liberals!"
maf.election.3.c:0 "The Social Democrats!"

POLITICS_HANS_ALBERT_DESC:0 "It would be incorrect to say that Hans Albert von Lettow-Vorbeck has had a simple life. Just barely before him reaching adulthood, his father died in 1918, resulting in the young Lettow-Vorbeck being put into the care of his famous uncle Paul. At this point, the 'Lion of Africa' still had no children, thus he treated the orphaned nephew as his own and ensured that he'd receive the best quality in terms of education, military training and preparation for becoming a colonial administrator.\n\nIn 1926 Hans was sent to Mbeya, an important city in the region close to the border of Ostafrika and North Rhodesia, as a civil servant. There, he met August and Ruth Eckhardt, two surgeons operating a hospital and school for German children in Tanganyika. The three became fast friends and Hans took a keen interest in expanding charitable work in his administrative area, showing early signs of his desire to reform the conditions plaguing the Colonial Bund.\n\nLacking any clear unifying figure after the departure of Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck to pursue a more peaceful life and grander politics of Germany proper, the Reforgruppe searched for a new leader who could lead the ailing imperial project into a brighter age. The work Hans carried out throughout 1920s made him a perfect candidate, not to mention the official recommendation from his uncle.\n\nAnd thus, the so-called 'Young Lion of Africa' hopes to attain glory no lesser than that of Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, while also serving as the candidate for Statthalter supported by rightist reformists like Theodor von Hassel. The world never knows if perhaps yet another Lettow-Vorbeck may change the fate of Afrika forever..."
POLITICS_AUGUST_STAUCH_DESC:0 "August Stauch is the prospector who discovered the diamond deposits near Lüderitz in Südwest. The story goes that he, having developed a fascination for diamonds after listening to the tales about Adolf Lüderitz, was one day in April 1908 approached by Zacharias Lewala, one of his aides who had previously worked at a diamond mine in Kimberley. \nLewala had picked up a diamond near Grasplatz and dutifully took brought it to Stauch, who then quietly resigned from his job after confirming his suspicion that this may be a diamond, by scratching his glass watch with the stone. \nStauch initially kept the knowledge of the find to himself and only announced it after securing a 75-acre claim at Kolmanskop in order to continue to do diamond searching. \nA diamond rush set in, and the German government took immediate interest in the activities at Lüderitz, and dispatched the secretary for the colonies to investigate the situation and bring order and control to the industry. A diamond taxation system was introduced and the issuing of licenses was limited which brought about some order to the industry. The town of Lüderitz observed an economic boom between 1908 and 1914 and was temporarily known as Africa’s richest town.\n\nWith his position as Staathalter secured Stauch is fully and capable of bringing his trademark prospecting skills to a new generation of German colonists. Under Stauch, Mittelafrika is sure to expect absolute record profits."
POLITICS_ALFRED_HANEMANN_DESC:0 "Alfred Hanemann had already served a distinguished career as a service captain and judge in Südwest. Under him the principle of 'Bezirkleitersrecht' where Schutztruppe officials can serve as legal judges in remote territories of the German empire in Africa first began to take shape. As an old soak of the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft Hanemann is very much a man of the Alter Kämpfer, who can expect to see some of their ideas come to fruition after all in spite of Mittelafrika's steps towards liberalisation.\n\nWith the Kaiser's support and the Staathaltership secured Hanemann is now free to bring peace and security to Germany's african empire."
POLITICS_ARNOLD_LEQUIS_DESC:0 "Although Arnold Lequis is a Schutztruppe veteran and can be accounted for having some experience with the goings on of colonial civil maintenance, his appointment to Staathalter by the Kaiser is regarded by many as a return to the ideas of the Neue Kolonialgruppe. \nWhether or not Lequis will be as exploitative and centralising as Ritter von Epp remains to be seen, but perhaps the reforms put in place by von Lettow-Vorbeck on their own are enough to prevent Mittelafrika from backsliding into renewed authoritarianism.\n\nWhatever the case may be, Lequis has promised to prioritise enacting comprehensive reform of the Schutztruppen to bring them in line with the Heimat's forces."

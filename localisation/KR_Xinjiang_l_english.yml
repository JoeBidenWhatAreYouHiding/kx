Should it fall, the only place left to retreat would be the minor city of Aksu under Sheng Shicai's control, and whether Sheng would even comply with Jin retreating there is completely unknown.

### Events ###
xin.0.t:0 "Introduction to the Xinjiang Clique"
xin.0.desc:0 "The Xinjiang province of China has had a disruptive history like much of the northwest, as the region has been constantly plagued with whispers of unrest to this day. The Xinhai Revolution spawned yet more of the already used to chaos caused by the local Uyghur population, being more Central Asian then Chinese. The present governor Yuan Du-Hua failed to keep the situation under control, fleeing the province and leaving it in the hands of his trusted advisor Yang Zengxin.\n\nYang through shrewd dealings and violent repression has kept Xinjiang 'stable' for his 20 years of governorship. Yang himself is a very paranoid man, taking all possible precautions to prevent uprisings while still repressing the Uyghurs located within Xinjiang to no end. By 36, he is a secluded soul staying within his house and rarely coming outside due to fear of political assassination by one of his few retainers left. Most duties are handled between his three most powerful advisors Jin Shuren, the Dao-yin of Hotan Ma Shaowu, and the Dao-yin of Aksu and foreign minister Fan Yaonan. Together these three handle most of the everyday administration of Xinjiang while taking orders from Yang himself on occasions. For now, the status quo within Xinjiang is kept but with Yang's seclusion getting worse and worse, anything could happen."
xin.0.a:0 "May Yang Zengxin live long and prosper"
xin.0.b:0 "What is the Kumul Khanate?"
xin.0.c:0 "Uyghurs?"

xin.1.t:0 "Xinjiang and the Kumul Khanate"
xin.1.desc:0 "The Kumul Khanate is officially a protectorate of the Qing within Xinjiang, and is a largely stabilizing factor for Xinjiang itself. Currently ruled by Nasīr Shah, the khanate does very little in the day to day rule of Xinjiang, besides having to pay tribute to the Xinjiang governorship yearly. Why does it matter? Many see the Kumul Khanate's current autonomy as the only thing keeping tensions within Xinjiang from exploding, as it shows a degree of Uyghur rule within the province even if people don't like the current ruler Nasīr. Its existence is key to our peace in the northwest, and only an absolute fool would even dare to try and mess with its presence."
xin.1.a:0 "This tiny guy sure is something..."
xin.1.b:0 "What is the general situation of Xinjiang?"
xin.1.c:0 "Uyghurs?"

xin.2.t:0 "The People of Xinjiang"
xin.2.desc:0 "The people of Xinjiang are by far the most unique in China, as many would argue that the majority are hardly Chinese at all. One of the largest ethnic groups is the Uyghur population, which is by far the most nationalist and well known ethnic group within Xinjiang. Two other notable groups are first the Kazakh population in the north with a population of about 400,000 and the Tungans in the south, the Xinjiang version of the Chinese Hui with a population around 450,000. The Tungans and Uyghurs are known for shaky relations, as the minority Tungans have long held control over the majority of Xinjiang, as seen now by the Dao-yin of Hotan being Ma Shaowu. Due to their overall separation from the Chinese people, the Uyghur and Kazakh population have long spelt the most trouble for our administration, rising up numerous times in the past in order to establish their independence from the rest of China."
xin.2.a:0 "That's enough, it's time to govern"
xin.2.b:0 "What is the general situation of Xinjiang?"
xin.2.c:0 "What is the Kumul Khanate?"

xin.3.t:0 "Troubles in the North"
xin.3.desc:0 "Dzungaria, mostly occupied by both Kazakhs and Mongols has been a trouble spot for Yang's administration since its emergence, serving as a hot spot of mainly Mongolian bandits to launch raids against our people. Despite being silent for the past year, troubles within Western Mongolia under Ungern's regime has spread to Xinjiang, as these bandits have reemerged once again. We'll need to wait for Yang's response on the issue to deal with the problem, but until then they will be troublesome."
xin.3.a:0 "These problems never end, do they?"

xin.4.t:0 "Yang's Silence"
xin.4.desc:0 "In a surprise to everyone but his closest advisors, Yang's response to this appearance has been limited at best. His paranoia of assassination has made him just stay inside his home, telling his officials "Bah, these Mongols were hardly trouble before, I doubt they'll be of much trouble now! The problem will take care of itself!" Despite this response, Jin Shuren, Yang Zengxin's top advisor, has begun to mobilize a force to the north in order to deal with the disturbance."
xin.4.a:0 "This is ludicrous..."

xin.5.t:0 "Collapse of the League"
xin.5.desc:0 "The news of the collapse of the Zhili hegemony in the south, the League of Eight Provinces, have just reached our ears. Despite the shock, Xinjiang's relative isolation from the rest of China has left the ripples reaching us being limited. Yang Zengxin's paranoia could be cause for concern however, he very likely feels his current position within the governorship is in danger."
xin.5.a:0 "Keep an eye on the situation"

xin.6.t:0 "Silence"
xin.6.desc:0 "Silence is all that has been heard for almost a month now. People only come to Yang's chamber when they have something to report, and this past month has been uneventful besides Jin Shuren's army being almost ready to crush the northern bandits. Even then, many are suspicious on the lack of response from Yang at all and no orders seemingly being sent at all. Jin Shuren has decided to temporarily pause the raising of his army in order to investigate the situation before he heads out on a month long expedition to make sure his superior is alright."
xin.6.a:0 "Surely our fears are unfounded"

xin.7.t:0 "Disappearance"
xin.7.desc:0 "In a shock to many, Yang is simply gone. The entire premises has been searched high and low for any sign of Yang being here for the past couple of days, but there's none. In fact, most of his possessions he has collected over the years seem to be missing as well. Jin is continuing to search the area for any signs of where Yang could have gone, but the chances of Yang even being in Dihua at this point is unlikely, leaving Jin and other retainers in a worrisome position. It could take months to receive a message from the Qing on who the new governor is, leaving the most important spot in Xinjiang completely vacant in the mean time."
xin.7.a:0 "Collaboration is key to remain order"

xin.8.t:0 "Robbery"
xin.8.desc:0 "As the home of Yang Zengxin continues to be searched, Jin himself has checked on the treasury of Xinjiang, supposedly filled with a fortune of taxes gained from the populace of Xinjiang. As Jin and his guards arrived, they opened the door...\n\nAnd all the money was gone.\n\nAn absolute fortune amassed over the period of twenty years has disappeared along with Yang Zengxin, leaving many theories as to exactly what has happened here. The most believed so far is Yang Zengxin simply... left. Yang has left with all of our money, possessions, and with his title of governor still intact."
xin.8.a:0 "..."

xin.9.t:0 "Coup"
xin.9.desc:0 "As the situation began to hit Jin Shuren during the investigation, he's realized the position he is in. There will be no new governor for months at least along with no Yang Zengxin, and he is the most prominent government official left within Dihua currently. He needed to make his move before anyone else arrived, using his recently made army that was supposed to crush the Mongol bandits.\n\nAnd as expected, he did. Jin Shuren with his 3,000 troops have stormed the capital and secured it completely, declaring himself governor of Xinjiang before a proper response from the Qing could even be formulated. Not all are pleased by these events, especially the Dao-yin of Aksu, Fan Yaonan, leading many to believe that crisis could be on its way to Xinjiang for the first time in 20 long years. Not only that, but it's not even known what the Qing will think about this turn of events, leaving Jin with absolute power over the entirety of Xinjiang until news is heard."
xin.9.a:0 "We have to believe in Jin"

xin.10.t:0 "An Invitation"
xin.10.desc:0 "With the everyday proceedings of Xinjiang continuing as normal, Jin Shuren has finally left for his expedition to crush the recently emerged Mongol bandits. All is well within Xinjiang, while the rest of China has erupted into chaos as a result of the League of Eight Provinces' collapse. In almost a celebration of the circumstances, the Dao-yin of Aksu and foreign minister of Xinjiang, Fan Yaonan, has announced a party, inviting many government officials, including Yang Zengxin. Yang's isolation has led most to expect him to decline this, but perhaps Yang could make use of a day of luxury with the recent stresses of governing?"
xin.10.a:0 "It's time to party!"
xin.10.b:0 "I've never trusted Fan before and certainly will not now"

xin.11.t:0 "The Party"
xin.11.desc:0 "The night was lively as Yang Zengxin entered Aksu today, seeing mass amounts of food and drink for the night, ready to spend this night to the fullest as if it will be his last. He sits down an hour later, ready to finally begin. He digs into his food as Fan Yaonan and a multitude of other governmental officials join him in the luxuries of life. Fan excuses himself from the table with Yang barely noticing, still indulging his gluttony. Fan Yaonan returned ten minutes later, with two guards with guns and red arm bands in tow behind him as he sits down again.\n\n"A toast, to Yang's continued health!"\n\nYang raised his glass as well, a smile on his face until he realized what was happening. The guards now pointed their guns as Yang, and shots immediately rang out in the banquet, and soon there was a dead, soiled, and decrepit Yang Zengxin lying on the ground with bullet holes in his head and chest."
xin.11.a:0 "To Fan Yaonan, our new leader!"

xin.12.t:0 "Jin Shuren's March"
xin.12.desc:0 "Jin Shuren wasted no time in heading back to Aksu after hearing of his former superior's death, with his recently raised force in tow. Fan Yaonan is seemingly completely unprepared for this, with his efforts to raise his own force to defend Aksu completely failing as the city descends into anarchy. He, his officials, and his small force of 200 hole up in Aksu, waiting for when Jin Shuren's horde arrives."
xin.12.a:0 "His prospects look dim"

xin.13.t:0 "The Second Takeover"
xin.13.desc:0 "Jin secured Dihua and quickly moved onto Aksu, where Fan Yaonan waited, desperately trying to set up as many defenses as he could before Jin would arrive. It was pointless, as when Jin arrived, soon after his securing of Dihua, his massive army rushed into the city and secured it all, eventually breaking through into Fan's residence, with Fan nowhere to be found. Before the Qing even knew their loyal governor Yang was gone, two coups have taken place in Xinjaing. Now Jin Shuren has installed himself as governor, and there is little Beijing can do about it."
xin.13.a:0 "I'll pass on the banquet this time"

xin.14.t:0 "Yang Zengxin's Death"
xin.14.desc:0 "As Yang Zengxin's various officials went to visit him today before the expedition to crush the Mongol threat to the north, they were shocked at what they found. Yang Zengxin seemed to have died in his sleep at an unknown time, leaving open many questions as to what is going to happen next. Many predict Jin Shuren's ascendance to the governor position by force before the Qing can react to the situation using his new army, but as of yet nothing has occurred. All that can be done is wait and see how the situation unfolds."
xin.14.a:0 "How could this have happened to us?"

xin.15.t:0 "Jin Shuren Secures Dihua"
xin.15.desc:0 "As many predicted, Jin Shuren has decided to make his move on Dihua and secure it using his newly armed force. The streets are filled with soldiers as any possible political dissidents are being removed one by one. Among these is the Dao-yin of Aksu, Fan Yaonan who has a somewhat petty rivalry with Jin. Little is known about what Jin's next moves will be, but many predict that Fan Yao-nan's position of power will not be lasting for much longer."
xin.15.a:0 "We lie in his hands..."

xin.16.t:0 "Jin's March on Aksu"
xin.16.desc:0 "As many predicted, Jin quickly moved from Dihua to remove Fan Yao-nan's position in power before he could even act. Many noticed what looks like the beginning of a build-up of defenses, but Fan's accomplices were killed before any meaningful resistance could be put up, though Fan himself could not be found. Some believe him to have escaped into the mountains to avoid capture. Ma Shaowu, the Dao-yin of Hotan has declared his loyalty to the new governor Jin Shuren, aiming to secure his rule in the south. Jin Shuren has agreed to this, finally achieving his rule over all of Xinjiang, at least for now."
xin.16.a:0 "Now these are the radical changes Xinjiang needs!"

xin.17.t:0 "Jin's Consolidation of Power"

Fan Yao-nan is missing, and with the cabinet slowly being replaced one by one, Jin is surely the ruler who has proven himself to be on top during this time of stress. No one knows what he has planned but based off his close proximity with Yang Zengxin, it most likely will be similar in policy. One piece still missing to the puzzle is the empty seat of the Dao-yin of Aksu, but surely someone will be appointed soon."

With these, the tax on Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Central Asian peoples is being doubled immediately. This is seen as completely ignoring Yang Zengxin's policy of treading carefully with the populace to avoid revolt, resulting in many seeing this as an overall risky move.

However, his pride and satisfaction didn't last for long.\n\nNasīr was soon invited to Jin's personal residence, where they went into the dining room and began to feast. As they became overcome with gluttony, the unexpected happened. Nasīr has two guns aimed at the back of his head. "Nasīr, your time is up. Come with us." Having no choice but to comply, Nasīr was taken to a prison deep within Urumqi, probably to be held there for the rest of his life.\n\nJin wasted no time in declaring the annexation of Kumul and the arrest of numerous officials, declaring the region 'Hami', the well-known Chinese name.

All considered highly trustable according to Jin, he trusts them to lead the incorporation of these stray people accordingly.

Kumul, the peacekeeper of Xinjiang, did have a notable effect in supressing northern Uyghur nationalism but the south is what truly benefited from this arrangment. The more conservative southern people have long been the hotbed for unorganized uprisings and rebellions which Shaowu has done well to contain so far through the use of police and overall suppression of information. However, such a major move as this might be too much to contain, despite Shaowu's assurance otherwise."

Already filling the cabinet with his own clique of trusted individuals, he plans on rooting out the unrest plauging the region before an organized uprising can occur, already beginning to form his own division to quell the sparks of conflict. While this could mean the further division of the deeply divided Xinjiang, it is preferable to the bastard Fan Yaonan or the possibility of falling to the Turks. Of course, a wary eye must still be kept to ensure Sheng does not get ideas above his station."

While Sheng will be controlling the army directly, he promises that supervision will be under Jin Shuren at all times. His loyalty has been true so far, perhaps suspicously so, but as long as he continues his declaration of loyalty, no problems should stand. However, problems aren't completely absent. Jin Shuren's brother and Provincial Commissioner for Military Affairs Jin Shuxin has protested Sheng's growing influence within the government, stating that Sheng is not what he seems and needs to be removed from power at once. Of course we can't just remove such a skilled official, but maybe we can keep a closer eye on him?"

Unrest and riots have begun to skyrocket even stronger then the initial annexation's result, with certain indiviuals managing to make themselves known. Particularly in Aksu, actions have only increased in violence as the wealthy Bughra Brothers have joined the riots, funding their efforts. While contained to Kashgar and Hotan for now, it isn't expected to remain there for long, as many see it reaching other major cities as well. We can only hope that this isn't the case and Shaowu can handle himself."

Leaving only minor garrisons in Kashgar and Hotan while distributing troops to other minor towns, he's taken the majority of his forces on a march to Aksu to assist in our efforts against Kumul. Whether he was right to make this decisions can't be known, but with the unrest only growing in the south, many are citing him as an absolute fool for compromising our situation even more."

Miners fed up with the lack of pay and ludicrous taxation have overthrown the administrators of the region, with many citing the wealthy Bughra Family being the ones funding their efforts. Now with a small amount of rifles, they have begun to march to Aksu in the name of Uyghur independence."

With Muhammad Amin Bughra, Abdullah Bughra, and Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra all becoming officially "Amirs of Hotan", they have fully taken the city while also meeting up with the Keriya rebels. This threat while still minor cannot be underestimated, as this move serves as a call to all Uyghurs to reclaim their own rule against our rightful government."

Former landowner in Aksu Timur Beg marched to Aksu, using his wealth to fund the rebels further. Slowly gaining the advantage against the small garrison, more and more continued to rise up against Shaowu's rule, having the Inner Kashgar City completely surrounded on all sides as the garrison desperately fights on in the hope of survival. With the most major locations in the south being captured by the dirty traitors, it can no longer be considered to be under our control, at least for the time being. The other garrisons have begun to completely panic and deploy themselves in the hopes of fighting to survive, but their chances are unlikely.\n\n§RThe Uyghur Rebellion has begun.§!"

While this insult to our name is already worthy of death, we need as much assistance as we can get so we need to tread carefully. The last thing we need is him defecting to the Kumuliks who already outnumber us alongside the Uyghurs to the south. During these times of pressure is when unity is neededn, and it seems not all the fools within government are willing to realize that."

xin.36.desc:0 "Ma Fuming, due to our lack of action towards his declaration of neutrality, has officially betrayed us in favor of the Kumuliks. His garrison has been deployed and is currently skirmishing with our other forces. Already outnumbered, this is only more of a dash to Jin's reputation as we continue to be on the back foot of this conflict and more desert us. We'll need to be more careful in the future."

Unluckly for us however, he's been very resistant to any and all attempts of concessions and doesn't seem to want to budge on the issue of mobilizing his army. Jin has declared the negotiations fruitless, and suggests sending troops to take him out and put someone else in charge of the army. While a radical proposal that could have some success, many others within the government think that continuing on with the negotiations will show our patience to this more than frusturated man and convince him to change his mind. Either choice is really valid, and could very easily shape the rest of the war."

The latest news we've heard is of the garrison being deployed, but considering the lack of message towards us about mobilization, we are better off believing that it is not deployed in our favor. Many are call Jin Shuren a fool for such blunder, as the Kumuliks only grow stronger from our own incompetence."

While many within our ranks predicted he would soon be defecting to our side and ignored him, Jin shockingly killed Fuming in his sleep in order to end the bickering once and for all. The garrison has now mobilized in the name of the Xinjiang governorship, leaving them stronger and more unified then ever. Of course with Zhongying and the mighty Yulbars on our side, they still shouldn't stand a chance against us."

Currently sitting in between Dihua and Aksu, many are worried about the possibility of him remaining this way throughout the entire war or even betraying our rightful cause in favor of the Kumuliks. Perhaps checking up on the man wouldn't be a bad move if we wish to convince him that our side is just?"

Such a close friend of Jin simply leaving without a word only further stains Jin's already terrible repuatation during this time of trouble, with rumors coming through of officials defecting to Sheng's "camp" within our governorship. Of course, even Sheng realizes that great unity is requires in times of great struggle for our noble cause, and nothing is to come of it."

It comes as my own personal recommendation that you too help me and all of your fellow administrators in our collective victory, unless of course you want to be stomped under the boot of the Butcher of Gansu Ma Zhongying, or perhaps the Uyghur in the south who will kill you if you don't convert to their heresy? I beg that you consider other possibilities from within as well if you don't move, as justice strikes those who least expect it."\n\nYour friend, Jin Shuren\n\nZhang Beiyuan has begun to mobilize his army in the name of the governorship and Han rule over Xinjiang.

Many rumour this individual to be Sheng Shicai, the Dao-yin of Aksu himself, but surely such a loyal and responsible individual would never try anything of the sort during a time where the governorship needs to be united."

Many see his significant military experience and competency in managing the city of Aksu as a healthy alternative to both Jin Shuren and Shaowu who has both proven their inability to manage a true crisis.\n\nSheng is calm, Sheng is responsible, Sheng is the man we need. Those are the words slipping out of the poisonous breath of those in our administration as Jin time and time again shows his complete foolishness.

He woke in the place he expected to be, the government capital, still being restrained by his guards. In front of him, Sheng Shicai, wielding a rifle. Without a word, Sheng points his rifle at Jin, as Jin begs for mercy among who he assumed was his most loyal subject. This fell upon deaf ears much to Jin's dismay, as the muzzle lit up and shot him, with Sheng's face being the last thing Jin saw in his lifetime.\n\nSheng Shicai has been installed as the new governor of Xinjiang, having overwhelming support from his fellow administrators including Ma Shaowu.

While he has faced the fate of a lower government position in Kashgar due to his military and political experience being notable, the fate of those who followed him to their side still needs to be decided.

While during their last moments, they were able to question how they had gotten to this point, they all knew the cause deep inside. The fire was coordinated by Sheng himself in order to remove his last remaining rivals from Xinjiang, leaving only simple ministers who don't question his orders at his side.

In fact, the entire building was empty, without a trace of any soul. All of this was in the report given to Sheng, as panic began to set in over the whereabouts of his three rivals. He would meet them sooner then expected however, as them and their army soon surrounded Aksu before Sheng could react. Sheng had been betrayed, as hsi own northern government was infiltrated by agents of the three men allowing this plot to occur.

As one of the guards sat on a step, taking apart his gun, his skull was suddenly filled with lead. The gunshot rang through the valley, as the rest of the guards sprang into action. A firefight broke out as, from the peak of a nearby hill, a band of soliders, around 18 strong, charged down the hill, led by Xinjiang Clique general Burhan Shahidi. The group were able to kill the 7 guards outside the house, but lost 3 themselves. As they approached the house, they lost 2 more to guards shooting out from the window. Shahidi himself kicked through the door and shot another guard through the head with his pistol. The group travelled through the house and killed another 3 guards, losing none themselves. Now, the only one left was Sabit Damulla. As the approached Sabit's bedroom, Shahidi reloaded his pistol, smiling at his success. However, when he bashed through the door, all he found was an empty bed and an open window. Shahidi realised his mistake of not leaving more soldiers outside to guard the perimeter, as Sabit Damulla slipped through his grasp. Within the hour hundreds of Sabits troops got to the house, but by then Shahidi and his men had gone.\n\nThough the assassination was a failure, it will still have dire consequences. Sabit Damulla, paranoid for his life, has gone into hiding, leaving it very difficult to communicate with him. Divisions are left disorganised and are even sometimes turing against eachother."
xinfd.16.a:0 "Damn them!"

xinfd.17.t:0 "Assassination failed on Sabit Damulla"
xinfd.17.d:0 "Burhan Shahidi has returned, having failed his mission. He recounts a story of how his men charged down a hill towards Sabit Damulla's house, killing multiple guards on their way down. He talks of how he himself kicked down the front door and shot multiple guards with his pistol. However, by the time he got to Sabit's bedroom, he had escaped.\n\nThough Shahidi failed in his mission, this is not a total loss. Our spies in Hotan and Kashgar have told us that Sabit Damulla has gone into hiding, completely isolating himself from most other people. This has led to complete disorganisation in the East Turkestan forces."
xinfd.17.a:0 "Not a total loss."

xin.110.desc:0 "Following the disappearance of Xinjiang's sage governor Yang Zengxin, reporters have flocked to Mengzi in Yunnan to get the scoop from his hometown. The townspeople of Mengzi remarked that Yang's family is still well off, and are refusing to give hints as to where Yang would have gone. Most reporters came to the conclusion that Yang had returned to his military post in Gansu, and ended their investigation there. The intrepid few with connections in Gansu, however, have reported that Yang has not been seen in Gansu, but traces of his gold bullion have shown up in the hands of trade merchants in Yunnan. Although there is no solid proof as of yet, it appears that Yang could either have been robbed or is living incognito."

The Dao-yin, which replaced the Amban, decide the fate of Xinjiang."

SIK_new_taxes:0 "New Taxes"
SIK_new_taxes_desc:0 "The taxes that incited such anger in Kumul are to be re-imposed, in spite of their reluctance. There is no other way to ply obedience from these provincials without setting the law and applying it justly to everyone. If they can't afford to pay, they should just leave Xinjiang for good."

SIK_a_closer_clique:0 "A Closer Clique"
SIK_a_closer_clique_desc:0 "The distribution of power between Dihua, Aksu and Khotan has proven to be unsustainable. Jin Shuren has made the generous decision to hire all capable bureaucrats currently serving in these cities to Dihua to centralize his rule. Even more graciously, Jin will pay the same to bureaucrats regardless of their ethnicity."

SIK_never_seen_suppression:0 "A New Suppression Campaign"
SIK_never_seen_suppression_desc:0 "In Xinjiang, conflicts are a family affair. Jin Shuren knew this, and is glad he left his family behind in Gansu.

SIK_gansu_road:0 "The Gansu Road"
SIK_gansu_road_desc:0 "The road to Gansu bends around the salt lake of Lop Nur, and passes through Hami. This route gave disproportionate influence to the ungrateful Khanate that used to live there.

SIK_tungan_domination_desc:0 "It is outrageous to the Governor that his garrisons are still plagued by drug addicted soldiers. The Turpan garrison showed a much greater restraint, and should be the model for all of Xinjiang's armed forces. We shall summarily replace the drug addicts in our military with sober muslims, who will not let the situation degrade as it did under other leaders."

SIK_opening_immigration:0 "Opening Immigration"

SIK_extend_network:0 "Extending the Network"
SIK_extend_network_desc:0 "The isolation of Xinjiang was due to Yang Zengxin's own paranoid leadership and kleptocracy. If Xinjiang is ever to recover and compete with both Central Asia and China, we must expand our trade network. "

SIK_purging_suspicion:0 "Purging Suspicion"
SIK_purging_suspicion_desc:0 "The civil servants of Xinjiang must be jaded at this point by the cycle of coups in their offices. Suspicion is not something the Governor can erase easily, but a good step towards creating a permanent government in Xinjiang is a mass promotion of those civil servants that did not steal from their office or engage in graft."

SIK_dao_yin_aksu:0 "The Dao-yin of Aksu"
SIK_dao_yin_aksu_desc:0 "Sheng's brief time as Dao-yin of Aksu has seen the city rise to great influence while the rest of Xinjiang crumbled.

SIK_establish_neutrality:0 "Establish Neutrality"
SIK_establish_neutrality_desc:0 "Governor Sheng is extremely wary of committing to a national conflict. Sending Xinjiang's soldiers abroad could invite dissidents at home to revolt once again.

SIK_seven_point_manifesto_desc:0 "After compiling a set of programmes from Southern China, including Sun-Yat Sen's Principles, Karl Marx's Capital, and Chen's Federalist decleration, Sheng has formulated a Seven Point Manifesto to reform Xinjiang towards true democracy with regards to the limitations of war time."

SIK_equality_of_races:0 "Equality of Races"
SIK_equality_of_races_desc:0 "One of Sheng's Seven Points is to end racial segregation in Xinjiang. As the Five Races Banner illustrates, China must recognize racial diversity, and incorporate Han with Hui, Mongol, and Tibetan.

SIK_kazakh_exodus:0 "Kazakh Exodus"
SIK_kazakh_exodus_desc:0 "The Kazakh people living on the border of Xinjiang are a source for future discontent. From sneaking Ottoman agitators into Kashgar, to distributing Jadidist literature, there is no value gained by tolerating them in Xinjiang. "

SIK_filling_government:0 "Filling the Government"
SIK_filling_government_desc:0 "When the cities of Xinjiang crumbled, the civil servants of Xinjiang were scattered.

SIK_positions_for_uyghurs:0 "Positions for Uyghurs"
SIK_positions_for_uyghurs_desc:0 "Although seperate, Uyghurs in Xinjiang did play a valuable role in defending Dihua. Governor Sheng feels that the tide of public opinion is slowly turning against Jadidists, and a reward to loyal officers like Burhan Shahidi is in order."

SIK_the_purge:0 "The Purge"
SIK_the_purge_desc:0 "It has come to the Governor's attention that there are inconsolable issues between the Uyghur and Hui people in Xinjiang. This is manifested in not only the rivalry between Jahriyya and Jadidist, but in a reinforcment of Chinese language as a shibboleth. Another, more organized purge may be necessary to solve this."

SIK_kuomintangs_xinjiang_desc:0 "The Kuomintang has interested Sheng Shicai for decades, going back to his early days in Manchuria. Having taken a position against direct intervention if unnecessary, Governor Sheng has chosen to aid the KMT through donations from the state treasury."

SIK_education_reform:0 "Education Reform"
SIK_education_reform_desc:0 "The madrasa in Kashgar, when Sheng shut it down, created a gap in education for the city. Like so many other towns in Xinjiang, formal education has been replaced with religious education by obvious Ottoman infiltrators. True education for Xinjiang must be secular, focused on science, and be open to both girls and boys."

SIK_modernist_schools:0 "Modernist Schools"

SIK_local_teachers_desc:0 "The folly of the Yang and Jin government was their mistrust of their own people to educate each other. Just as our Governor educated himself, so will the people utilize and adapt the revolutionary literature of our time to improve their lives."

SIK_cultural_promotion_socities:0 "Cultural Promotion Societies"
SIK_cultural_promotion_socities_desc:0 "The people of Xinjiang suffer from the Imperialist mindset. Instead of working towards cooperation, it is evident to Governor Sheng that the Uyghur and Hui people will need to be supported within the Han system of the Kuomintang. This can be achieved through Cultural Promotion Societies."

SIK_curbing_addiction_desc:0 "The garrisons of Xinjiang suffered under Yang Zengxin's leadership, especially with regards to discipline.

SIK_expand_tungan_recruitment:0 "Expand Tungan Recruitment"
SIK_expand_tungan_recruitment_desc:0 "The Tungan people are neglected by the Western Gate, and are suffering more than most in Western China. This makes the Tungan people ideal recruits for the Xinjiang military, which can elevate and allow young men to escape poverty in their home town."

SIK_uyghur_militia:0 "Uyghur Militia"
SIK_uyghur_militia_desc:0 "The Uyghur people suffer greatly during this time of disunity, and their young men wander aimlessly for a purpose. In order to ensure they do not fall under into the clutches of the Jadidists, we must make the effort to recruit them into a militia. The milita will be a safeguard against anti Han agitation, even if it is never strong enough to be used."

SIK_proper_training:0 "Proper Training"
SIK_proper_training_desc:0 "The Governor has ordered new training manuals from Baoding to be shipped to his office, convinced that new developments in military schools outmode current training.

SIK_expand_arms_industry:0 "Expand the Arms Industry"
SIK_expand_arms_industry_desc:0 "The arms industry in Xinjiang has long depended on outdated weapons from the east being sold to us at inflated prices.

SIK_expand_military_academy:0 "Expand Kashgar Chinese Schooling"
SIK_expand_military_academy_desc:0 "Kashgar, in the wake of the madrasa's closing, lacks any form of reliable education.

SIK_raid_nationalist_camps_desc:0 "Nationalist camps on the border of Xinjiang have taken advantage of the fertile land in recent years to set up farms.

SIK_foreign_assistance:0 "Foreign Assistance"
SIK_foreign_assistance_desc:0 "The current state of the Xinjiang foreign office is lamentable. Where just two decades ago Russian diplomats, Ambans, and British explorers gladly filed in to inform the Governor, now most avoid it for fear of being extorted by the few remaining bureaucrats. The Governor has authorized the hiring of more bureaucrats to reform the office."

SIK_russian_sector:0 "The Russian Connection"
SIK_russian_sector_desc:0 "Diplomatic relations with Russia were not kept up under Governor Yang Zengxin, and our remaining influence on Russia comes in the form of land grants to speculators.

SIK_russian_investment:0 "Russian Economic Investment"
SIK_russian_investment_desc:0 "It is reported that in Kazan there are fraudulent claims in Xinjiang for sale.

So long as they are for land we haven't already sold."

SIK_industrial_expansion:0 "Industrial Expansion"
SIK_industrial_expansion_desc:0 "The vast flow of unemployed workers into Xinjiang is an opportunity for us to expand the provincial armory.

SIK_mineral_expedition:0 "Mineral Expedition"
SIK_mineral_expedition_desc:0 "There are rumors that a massive oil deposit exists in Dunshanzi. It is well worth the cost for the Governor to send engineers out to Dunshanzi and assess the value of the land. We can hopefully recoup the cost by producing valuable land grants."

SIK_south:0 "Connecting the South"

SIK_settling_dzungaria_tribes_desc:0 "The tribes of Dzungaria have been unable to reap the benefits from the good harvests of 1936. Their town leaders have requested permission to resettle south, something the Governor does not want, but lacks the force to deny."

SIK_northern_gold:0 "Northern Gold"
SIK_northern_gold_desc:0 "The rumors of gold in western Xinjiang have made their way into fraudulent land grants you can find throughout western China. It is obvious to the Governor that an official expedition to the reported sources of gold must be made. The potential wealth, if proven true, will more than pay for the trip."

SIK_khotan_carpet_factory:0 "Expand the Hotan Carpet Factory"
SIK_khotan_carpet_factory_desc:0 "Khotan is famed for their hardy wool carpets, to the point where you can find markets in Afghanistan and India passing them off as ours. It may behoove the Governor to invest in a large scale carpet factory in Khotan, if only for the ability to manipulate the market and increase their value."

SIK_kashgar_investment:0 "Investing in Kashgar"
SIK_kashgar_investment_desc:0 "The destruction wrought in Kashgar must be answered with concern. The Governor has authorized funding to go into repairing and building small scale industry in Kahsgar."

SIK_navigating_desert:0 "Navigating the Taklamakan"
SIK_navigating_desert_desc:0 "The Taklamakan basin is a death trap for travelers, and for decades has been circumvented by the road to Kumul.

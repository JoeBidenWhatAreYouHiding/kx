### Leaders ###
POLITICS_SAUDI_DESC:0 "Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the mortal rival of many dead men, now turns his sights towards Saud bin Abdulaziz. This rivalry began when the young Ibn Saud was ejected from his tent in Riyadh by the Rashids. Never a pawn of Emirs, ibn Saud's father rallied the destitute men of the coastal Emirates to the great goal of his dynasty, Wahhabism. The Rashids were then ejected at the cost of many men, including their only western ally. Ibn Saud himself started many a feud the Saudis inherited, as he expressed hatred towards any Arab who turned their nose up towards Bedouins. This seed of anger had passed onto his men, who inherited his ferocity and may turn this youthful fury against him yet."
POLITICS_SULTAN_OTAIBI_DESC:0 "An illiterate member of the Otaibah Bedouin tribe, Sultan came to head the so-called Ikhwan which formed a considerable portion of the forces of the house of Saud. Believing in a divine duty to spread Sunni fundamentalism, Sultan was none to pleased when the house of Saud attempted to limit his ability to raid neighbouring countries. Sultan now takes up arms against both his old allies in the house of Saud and the wider heathenous world."

### Decisions ###
SAU_JBS_Power_Struggle:0 "Preparations for the War of Unification"
SAU_JBS_Power_Struggle_desc:0 "For years we have waited for the opportunity to unite the Arabian peninsula under the House of Saud. Sadly the Ottoman watchdogs did not sleep with both eyes closed and when the British Empire fell in 1925, they more than rewarded their Rashidi lapdogs for their "loyalty" during the Weltkrieg. As we were left with nothing, devoid of allies and territorial gains, Abdulaziz grew ever more restless and vengeful.\n\nSaud bin Abd Al-Aziz may be enjoying the support of his Ottoman allies but dark clouds are gathering on the horizon and should his powerful benefactor find himself occupied in internal matters, his pathethic armies will have the face the Ikhwans rage all on their own...\n\n§gThe strength of our £in_combat §GAllies§! will determine the size of our army at the start of the war with [JBS.GetNameWithFlag]. Courting the Central Arabian tribes and securing assistance from the Ikhwan could help tip the scales in our favour.§!\n      [JBS.GetNameWithFlag] : [?JBS.num_divisions|H0] ([?JBS.tribes|H0])\n      [SAU.GetNameWithFlag] : [?SAU.num_divisions|H0] ([?SAU.tribes|H0])\n" 

SAU_War_of_Unification:0 "Arabian War of Unification"
SAU_War_of_Unification_desc:0 "The Final Struggle for control over the Arab interior is rapidly approaching as the Ottoman behemoth is crackling under the weight of the worldwide economic depression, temporarily unable to maintain peace on the peninsula. All Emirs will have to pick a side for the future of the Arab world will be written in blood and the losers will find themselves disgraced, cast aside or slain on the field of battle."
SAU_War_of_Unification_Peace:0 "Imminent Collapse"
SAU_War_of_Unification_Peace_desc:0 "Whilst the deserts of Arabia are no strangers to war, its economy and agrarian base can not sustain long conflicts without intermittent armistices and decisive victories. Should either the House of Rashid or Saud find itself on the verge of victory, the other will have no choice but to admit that it does not have the capacity to sustain a lengthy siege or a war of attrition."

Zealous religious warriors, they are not bound by loyalty to Ibn Saud but by allegiance to the strict morals of Islamic society. Renouncing all Western advances, the Ikwhan wish to purify the Islamic world of its decadence and unite all muslims in a single unitary state.\n\nNonetheless they are an unruly and barbaric force, slitting the throats of all male prisoners they encounter and fighting with swords and lances. This makes them a worthy asset however to Ibn Saud as their zealously and bloodthirstiness is used in their infamous raids on the territories of our neighbours."

SAU_industrialization_effort_desc:0 "By some called the centre of Islam, the Holy City of Mecca is the pearl in the crown of any would-be Arabian warlord. Not only does it entail a degree of prestige otherwise impossible to acquire, it is also the end-point of the Hajj which even today is already our primary economic drive. Far more developed and with a modern bureaucracy, its incorporation into our realm will however not be a sinecure."

SAU_techslot_machine:0 "Build Universities"
SAU_techslot_machine_desc:0 "The final step our plans for education is naturally the higher learning, and revitalising the science and advancement than once were synonym with the Arabic language. Naturally, more hawkish advisers see more 'practical' gains from such universities..."

### Events
saud.1.t:0 "The Emirate of Nejd"
saud.1.d:0 "The Weltkrieg was one of many signs that we, the House of Saud, are destined the rule this land. In the hour of his greatest hubris, the Hashemites were abandoned by their infidel puppet masters and left for dead to the Turks and their puppet masters. While our inactivity in the war proved most fortuitous when it came time to avoid Ottoman retaliation, the decadent Turks hold no real sway over us. Now we bide our time, gathering warriors, money, and expertise to strike at the Rashidis, who think they can play both sides by accepting Hashemite warriors and pay lip service to the Porte, and finally unite Arabia under our flag!"
saud.1.a:0 "Long live the House of Saud."

saud.2.t:0 "Saudi Arabia"
saud.2.d:0 "Today with our victory over the house of Rashidis and the conquest of the Hejaz, the Saudis stand dominant. With this victory we shall rule over all Arabs!"

saud.31.t.india:0 "Indian Muslims celebrate the renewed caliphate!"
saud.31.t.insulindia:0 "News of the Caliphate Reaches Insulindia"
saud.31.t.other:0 "The Sultan of Arabia declares himself Caliph"

saud.31.d.EGY:0 "The Sultan of Arabia has declared himself the Caliph of Islam. Many liberals in the cafés throughout Egypt were said to burst into laughter at the news finding it ridiculous, even Sultan Farouk was said to find this news ridiculous. Even among the conservative Ittihad party, Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb both came out and denounced it calling the Sultan of Arabia immoral and not fit to hold the office."
saud.31.d.PER:0 "News has reached [266.GetName] that the Sultan of Arabia has declared himself the Caliph of Islam. The caliph of Sunni Islam specifically. The vast majority of people in [PER.GetNameDef] are Shia Muslim and consequently have little interest in what the Arab Sultan decided. We do not care about him."
saud.31.d.india:0 "Throughout India the Muslims have decided to celebrate the new Caliphate that has been declared by the Sultan of Arabia. While most of the elites have not taken part of this celebration, the Muslim masses of India have."
saud.31.d.insulindia:0 "News of the Sultan of Arabia's decision to declare himself the Caliph of Islam has reached Insulindia. Most of the Muslims in Insulindia have not approved of this decision."
saud.31.d.OTT:0 "We have received news from Arabia that the people there have seemed to decide that we are not the caliph in their eyes. This is an outrage that we shall not forget."
saud.31.d.RUS:0 "The Sultan of Arabia has declared himself the Caliph of Islam. This is an obvious ploy at power. The various Russian Muslims have rejected his claim, we do not need to recognise the claims."
saud.31.d.other:0 "The Sultan of Arabia has declared himself the Caliph of Islam. This is an obvious ploy at power. We should reject his claim, we do not need to recognise the claims."

saud.31.a.PER:0 "Who cares what the Arab Sultan claims."
saud.31.a.india:0 "Inshallah."
saud.31.a.OTT:0 "Reject these ludicrous claims!"

### Other Events
saud.53.t:0 "Weapon Sales to Nejd"
saud.53.d:0 "To bolster their army in the coming struggle against the Ottoman Empire, Nejd has offered us large sums of wealth and oil if we were to assist them in their struggle."
saud.53.a:0 "Send them the weapons."
saud.53.b:0 "We don't care about some desert in the Middle East."

saud.54.t:0 "Germany refuses the sale"
saud.54.d:0 "In a surprising move from Berlin, the German government has refused to authorise the sale of weapons to us claiming there are more worthwhile partners in need of their support than some nomads in a worthless desert."
saud.54.a:0 "They'll regret this!"

saud.55.t:0 "Germany accepts the sale"
saud.55.d:0 "Berlin has accepted our terms and have sent the first batch of weapons to Riyadh to assist us in the coming battle. While it is a costly gamble for our government, it may pay off in the long run."
saud.55.a:0 "These weapons will annihilate the Rashidi scum!"

saud.150.t:0 "The Ikhwan rebel!"
saud.150.d:0 "The Ikhwan has been a strong army presence in Arabia for decades. They were also one of the principle reasons we were able to succeed in defeating the other Arab states and assert Saudi dominance in the region. However, the Ikhwan have always been a traditional group, highly religious, and vehemently against change and reform. They do not seem to understand that modernisation is necessary when ruling a nation. Normally, we can control any anger felt by the Ikhwan with promises that we won't modernise any more. However, it seems we've pushed them too far this time. Ikhwan soldiers have united under the leadership of Faisal Al Duwaish, an Ikhwan commander, who has declared that the Saudis are unfit to rule Arabia. Many Ikhwan militia have risen up, and fighting has already begun..."
saud.150.a:0 "We will crush these rebels, for Arabia!"

saud.151.t:0 "Emirs swear loyalty to the Saudi state"
saud.151.d:0 "The tent city of Riyadh saw the procession of sabers upon many soldeirs heads under Ibn Saud's orders. In it's wake is the procession of captured Emirs. The first, including the Rashidis, Hashimite, Al Thani and Howietat were deemed too rebellious to be loyal vassals to Nejd. The latter, including the Al Nahyan and the Gadban of the Bani Lam, were more useful. Ibn Saud has decided to spare the families of the Emirs on the condition that they swear total alligence to the Saudi Arabia. This new form of vassalage is different from the ruthless precedence Ibn Saud's forefathers operated on, and are protected from the Ikhwan in perpetuity. "
saud.151.a:0 "Sufficient is Allah as our ally"

saud.152.t:0 "An Offer from [From.GetNameDef]"
saud.152.d:0 "We are involved in a war with [FROM.GetNameDef] due to our alliance with [OMA.GetNameDef]. However, with the capitulation of [OMA.GetNameDef], we have lost our only foothold in the Arabian peninsula. We are now faced with a choice - invade the peninsula by force, or seek peace and cut our losses."
saud.152.a:0 "Oman was not of much use, anyway."
saud.152.b:0 "We shall not betray our allies!"

saud.153.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Seeks Peace"
saud.153.d:0 "With the collapse of the [OMA.GetAdjective] defenses, their allies in [FROM.GetNameDef] were left without a foothold in Arabia - and as such, without any means to threaten us. Unfortunately, we are also unable to threaten or invade them in any way. [FROM.GetNameDef] has approached us with an offer - in exchange for peace, they will cut any ties with the [OMA.GetAdjective] state."
saud.153.a:0 "We are one step closer to uniting Arabia!"
saud.153.b:0 "No peace with the invaders!"

saud.154.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Declares Continuation of War"
saud.154.d:0 "While the collapse of the [OMA.GetAdjective] defenses brought hope that their allies in [FROM.GetNameDef] would attempt to cut their losses and seek peace, it appears that Muscat has found itself an ally willing to bleed itself dry."
saud.154.a:0 "The war goes on, then."

saud.155.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses our Offer!"
saud.155.d:0 "Despite our generous offer, the Arabs have refused any peace terms with the \"foreign invaders\"."
saud.155.a:0 "What?"

saud.900.t:0 "An Offer from [From.GetName]"
saud.900.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] have offered us an out from a Quagmire in the Middle East - we are involved in a war with them due to [OMA.GetName], and with the capitulation of [OMA.GetName], they have approached us with an offer for peace"
saud.900.a:0 "They were not of much use, anyway."
saud.900.b:0 "We shall not betray our allies!"

saud.901.t:0 "[OMA.GetName] Betrayed"
saud.901.d:0 "We have recieved news that [OMA.GetNameWithFlag] shall be ours!"
saud.901.a:0 "We are one step closer to Uniting Arabia!"
saud.901.b:0 "We are one step closer to Uniting Arabia!"
saud.901.c:0 "We've changed our mind on that. Total War it shall be."
saud.901.d:0 "We are one step closer to Uniting Arabia!"

saud.902.t:0 "Offer Refused!"
saud.902.d:0 "It appears that Muscat has found itself an ally willing to bleed itself dry."
saud.902.a:0 "Onwards to Glory!"

saud.903.t:0 "The Sauds Retract Their Offer!"
saud.903.d:0 "The Sauds, despite our generous offer, have refused to peace out."

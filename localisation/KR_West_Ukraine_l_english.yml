### Events ###
wsu.1.t:0 "West Ukraine Secedes!"
wsu.1.d:0 "As soon as active hostilities began in Galicia, in its eastern part, Ukrainians began to consolidate forces for the declaration of independence of the Ukrainian lands and their further reunification with Kyiv. It began with popular uprisings, which soon turned into violent clashes between Ukrainians and Poles. The Ukrainian Galician Army intervened, stopping the unrest and arresting the instigators, but at the same time a long deputy of the Austrian Parliament and the Galician Sojm, Yevhen Petrushevych, announced the creation of an independent Ukrainian state, began creating responsible bodies and mobilizing in the rebel army. The situation is clearly not in our favor."
wsu.1.a:0 "Ukraine is not yet lost! (Play as West Ukraine)"
wsu.1.b:0 "How dare they!"

wsu.2.t:0 "Clashes Between Poles and Ukrainians"
wsu.2.d:0 "People's marches and rallies of pro-independence Ukrainians began in eastern Galicia. In large Ukrainian cities like Tarnopol and Stanislaviv, they have reached fairly large proportions, but the situation is worst in predominantly Polish Lviv, where local Polish nationalists have already confronted the protesters. The situation is escalating by the day..."
wsu.2.a:0 "Situation is getting out of our control!"

wsu.3.t:0 "Polish Resistance in Lviv"
wsu.3.d:0 "The Polish majority in Lviv has engaged in open confrontation with us. The Poles are arming themselves and preparing to defend the city, from which our troops have been forced to temporarily retreat. If we fail to retake Lviv, the road to Kyiv will be closed to us."
wsu.3.a:0 "Get ready for the siege of Lviv!"

wsu.4.t:0 "The Lands of Eastern Galicia in 1936"
wsu.4.d:0 "As a result of the First Partition of Poland, Eastern Galicia, inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians, was annexed to the Austrian Empire and became part of the Kingdom of Galicia-Lodomeria. By 1936, the kingdom was granted fairly broad autonomy, which did not save the situation of ethnic Ukrainians in these lands. Torn apart by ethnic strife and widespread poverty, Galicia could barely cope.\nDespite Vienna's initial support for the Ukrainian national movement, this turned out to be very much part of the political confrontation with Russia. As soon as the Hetmanate was consolidated in Kyiv, and later the Austrian king was put on the throne, the question of Eastern Galicia seemed to be forgotten and put on the back burner. No action was taken to create a national autonomy of Ukrainians separate from Western Galicia, and the talk was idle talk. However, the Ukrainian Galician Army was created from the volunteer legion of Ukrainian Secherdsmen who had remained in Western Ukraine, though in direct subordination to the Austro-Hungarian commander-in-chief. \nBy now, the self-proclaimed state of the Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia rests on the bayonets of the Galician Army and the authority of Yevhen Petrushevych, a fighter for the autonomy of Eastern Galicia and a popular Western Ukrainian politician."
wsu.4.a:0 "Ukraine is not yet lost!"

wsu.5.t:0 "Convocation of the UNRada"
wsu.5.d:0 "By decision of the national representative assembly, the Ukrainian National Rada of the West Ukrainian regions of Austria-Hungary was established and convened. \n\nThe assembly was composed of all Ukrainian deputies of both Austrian chambers, regional sejms of Galicia and Bukovina, representatives of the episcopate, in addition to a number of prominent non-party professionals, representatives of youth elected from the cities. Petrushevych, the most authoritative person in Western Ukraine at the moment, was appointed Chairman of the Rada.\n\nFor now, without the possibility of sitting in Lviv, the Rada plans to continue to meet in Tarnopol, but the most important issues, including the foreign policy situation, namely the fate of the Western Ukrainian lands as part of Austria, must already be decided.\n\nSome deputies are inclined to reach an agreement with representatives of Austria on broad autonomy, while others demand full independence from Austrian rule, which has not justified itself. All of these issues have yet to be resolved, but the main one is the land issue in connection with the domination of the Polish nobility and the liberation of Lvov."
wsu.5.a:0 "Hopefully we will endure..."

wsu.6.t:0 "Battle For Lviv"
wsu.6.d:0 "An armed uprising of Poles began in Lviv. Polish militants occupied the southwestern part of the city and opened recruitment points for volunteers. Active points of resistance were formed in the school named after Gjorgiev. The Polish insurgents occupied the southwestern part of the city and began shelling the Ukrainian formations on Sapiga Street and Gorodotska Street. The Polish civilians also rushed to their support, attacking the UGA from windows, gates, and alleys. Active fighting began for the railway station.\n\nThe Lviv Defense Command under Colonel Hnat Stefaniv was formed, but the UGA top leadership was still undecided about the strategy for introducing combat under the current conditions.\n\nOne option was to reinforce the garrison of the railway station to prevent the Poles from supplying the rebels in Lviv. The second option is to attack the central quarter along Gorodotska Street and clear the Zholkivskyi suburbs and Zamarstyniv from the enemy."

wsu.7.t:0 "The Station Holds"
wsu.7.d:0 "By supplementing the defense forces of the railway station, we were able to protect it from Polish formations, thereby cutting off their ability to get supplies from Peremyshl. \n\nHowever, the fighting for the station did not stop there. The Poles made every effort to seize it, as well as the supply depots nearby. Nevertheless, we must now decide what to do next.\n\nOne option is to regroup, surround the Polish formations in the southwest, and finally defeat them. That way, the Battle of the Lions will be won. However, this would require weakening the defense of the station, which could result in it falling into Polish hands." #Railway Station Defended
wsu.7.a:0 "We should regroup and surround the Polish!" #=>9
wsu.7.b:0 "Defend the railway station!" #=>11

wsu.8.t:0 "The Station Falls!"
wsu.8.d:0 "Only two dozen riflemen were assigned to guard the main railway station, and they were unable to repel the Polish detachments. Polish forces seized the main railway station and protracted battles began for it and for the nearby warehouses. Soon Polish forces were able to occupy the areas of the Polytechnic, St. Jura Cathedral, St. Elizabeth's Church, and surrounded the main post office and the Citadel, where the main backbone of the Ukrainian garrison defending Lviv was located.\n\nA formal battle line was formed - the Poles occupied the western part of the city with the main railway station, we held the middle and eastern parts with the High Castle and the Lviv-Podzamche railway station. Our main strongholds were the barracks on Janowska Street, the Galician Seim, the Citadel and the Main Post Office.\n\nHowever, thanks to the capture of the railway station, new Polish troops were constantly arriving in the city. It is unknown whether we will be able to hold the city until help arrives. It is now necessary to decide what defense tactics to choose.\n\nThe Command assumes that there will be fierce fighting for the Main Post Office and the Citadel, where numerous UGA troops are stationed. However, there is another option - to shorten the front to give mobility to the available forces, and to put howitzer batteries on the heights to bombard the enemy. In addition, it is necessary to cut the Peremyshl-Lvov railroad."
wsu.8.a:0 "Bombard the enemy to provide support for our troops" #=>10
wsu.8.b:0 "Cut their supplies from Peremyshl!" #=>11

wsu.9.d:0 "Despite initial successes, the regrouping of troops and their redeployment led to a significant weakening of the station's defenses, allowing the Poles to seize it. Now the entire western part of the city was under their control. Soon Polish forces were able to occupy the areas of the Polytechnic, St. Jura Cathedral, St. Elizabeth's Church, and surrounded the main post office and the Citadel, where the main backbone of the Ukrainian garrison defending Lviv was located.\n\nA formal battle line was formed - the Poles occupied the western part of the city with the main railway station, we held the middle and eastern parts with the High Castle and the Lviv-Podzamche railway station.

In addition, it is necessary to cut the Peremyshl-Lvov railroad."

wsu.10.t:0 "Battle For Lviv Lost!"
wsu.10.d:0 "The previous two days were fierce battles for the Main Post Office. The Poles continually attacked the house, keeping the approaches to it under heavy fire and firing on the windows. On the same day there was shelling in the area of Ferdinand's barracks on Kleparowska street as well as other sections of the front. The general command had to regroup in the old village. In Gorodotska Street there was fighting from the morning, and in Podzamcze there was a whole day of fierce fighting with Polish legionnaires and gangs of the Polish city garrison.\n\nSoon, however, cannon bateri appeared at the High Castle, as well as artillery in the Citadel and in Krivchitsy. Thanks to bombardment from Stary Selo, Persenkivka and Citadel, Ukrainian units occupied Kulparkiv. The Polish front moved back a bit, there was a fight for one of the important hubs of the Polish resistance, the cadet school.\n\nNevertheless, the Peremysh-Lvov railroad was not cut, and this was fatal for our forces. Reinforcements were coming in from Poland along it. There was an overlap, which the Poles used to redeploy their strongest troops. When fighting resumed, our troops were half surrounded by superior enemy forces. Colonel Stefaniv ordered a retreat and the Ukrainian defenders of Lviv were forced to leave the city. A sub-Lviv front was formed. Today the last Ukrainian unit retreated from Lviv and a siege of the city began, but the government has already requested a formal truce from the Poles."
wsu.10.a:0 "Unfortunately..."

wsu.11.t:0 "Battle For Lviv Won!"
wsu.11.d:0 "The Peremyshl-Lvov railroad was successfully cut, preventing the Poles from delivering supplies and reinforcements to Lvov. Polish resistance was encircled and met with stiff resistance from Ukrainian units. The battle front from the Citadel, through the Sejm building to the train station did not sag at any point. Despite the initial superiority of the enemy, the Ukrainian troops repulsed his offensive and in many places went on a counteroffensive. \n\nThanks to the artillery placed on the heights, Polish formations were also bombed. Eventually many Poles surrendered and the city was liberated. The battle for Lviv was won, but the war itself was just beginning. It is unlikely that Polish commanders would simply abandon their attempts to regain control of the city."
wsu.11.a:0 "Great!"

wsu.12.t:0 "Bukovina Lies Unprotected"
wsu.12.d:0 "With the Chaos in Galicia, the opportunity to invade Bukovina is now available. As the General Staff suggests, we can freely invade [713.GetName] and protect fellow Romanian who live there."
wsu.12.a:0 "Do it!"

wsu.13.t:0 "[713.GetName] Under Our Control!"
wsu.13.d:0 "While we have seized [713.GetName] the Northern part of Bukovina, with the city of Cernăuți is also a good possibility. However, the majority of the region is populated by Ukrainians and invading this part can result in the war with [WSU.GetName]. We should be careful in this decision."
wsu.13.a:0 "We don't care about their failed state!"
wsu.13.b:0 "Better not risk a war with them"

wsu.14.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Annexed [713.GetName]"
wsu.14.d:0 "Using our instability, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has invaded the region of [713.GetName], where the majority of population is Romanian. While we have not officially claimed this region, it is still bad that the Romanians have not even attempted to resolve the issue diplomatically. Moreover, we now fear that they are likely to invade the Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi as well."
wsu.14.a:0 "That's mean of them."

wsu.15.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Invades Chernivtsi!"
wsu.15.d:0 "As we thought, the Romanians though that [713.GetName] is not enough for their idea of Greater Romania and now they also claim Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi. We cannot allow this to happen, but we also cannot allow to fight a war in all fronts. We shoud make the decision."
wsu.15.a:0 "We will defend our land!"
wsu.15.b:0 "We'll retake it later."

wsu.16.t:0 "West Ukraine Seizes Our Lands!"
wsu.16.d:0 "During the chaos in Galicia, the West Ukraine has proclaimed its independence, claiming our regions of [73.GetName] and [1119.GetName]. They have aggressively violated our borders and we cannot leave it without any notice."
wsu.16.a:0 "Declare war on them!"
wsu.16.b:0 "We should defeat other enemies first."

wsu.17.t:0 "Battle For Lwów Won!"
wsu.17.d:0 "Thanks to the Polish defenders of Lwów, Ukrainian troops were forced to abandon the city, nevertheless beginning its siege. However, it will be very, very difficult for them without the largest supply point. The Ukrainian command has already asked us for terms of peace and negotiations. We can refuse their request and free Eastern Galicia from their pointless resistance. However, it may be easier to negotiate with them."
wsu.17.a:0 "Ask for Austrian mediation"
wsu.17.b:0 "No negotiations are possible, crush them!"

wsu.18.t:0 "Battle For Lwów Lost!"
wsu.18.d:0 "In Lwów, where most of the population is ethnic Poles, there were heavy and fierce battles between the Polish defenders of the city and the Ukrainian resistance. Unfortunately, the city was lost, and now the Ukrainians have it under their complete control. We cannot tolerate this, but without Lviv we cannot defeat the Ukrainian Galician Army."

wsu.19.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Asks For Assistance in East Galicia"
wsu.19.d:0 "Since the start of the war in our Kingdom of Galicia-Lodomeria, the Eastern part of it, mostly inhabited by the ethnic Ukrainians have proclaimed its independence. Soon after there was a battle for Lemberg, a city mostly populated by Poles, but surrounded by the Ukrainians. Now [FROM.GetName] asks for our assistance to resolve the insurgency peacefully. Perhaps, we should contact the head of the Ukrainian self-proclaimed state, Yevhen Petrushevych and his government, since he was a long-term delegate of the Austrian Parliament."
wsu.19.a:0 "We should try to negotiate with them"
wsu.19.b:0 "No, we should attack provide all military assistance to our loyalists!"

wsu.20.t:0 "Delegation from [FROM.GetName]"
wsu.20.d:0 "Today the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has arrived in order to negotiate our the relations between our nations. The first issue to decide is, however, if we are even ready for negotiations with the Austrians, but such a great country can pose a serious threat to our independence."
wsu.20.a:0 "Sure, we agree."
wsu.20.b:0 "They never fulfilled any of their promises, reject them!"

wsu.21.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agrees"
wsu.21.d:0 "Luckily, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to talk to us and negotiate their future. The main issue is their future within the empire. While the leftists suggest that we should recognize West Ukrainian right for autonomy, it is clear that their main aim is to reunite with [UKR.GetName] which can be too complicated to achieve. Nevertheless, they are more likely to agree to that. The radicals, however, suggest that we should completely recognize their independence, but invite them to our sphere of influence. While criticized by many, this decision has the most chances to succeed, even though we are not willing to loose parts of our Empire.\nThe conservative suggestion is the most radical, however: demand their full incorporation back into Galicia and Lodomeria, which will they are likely to reject."
wsu.21.a:0 "Offer them wide autonomy within Empire"
wsu.21.b:0 "Recognize their independence, if they join our sphere"
wsu.21.c:0 "Demand their incorporation into Galicia-Lodomeria!"

wsu.22.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
wsu.22.d:0 "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused any talks if we are not ready to recognize their full independence and sovereignity. We have not much choice now."
wsu.22.a:0 "We are too busy on all fronts now, let the Poles solve it themselves!"
wsu.22.b:0 "Attack them jointly with Poles!"

wsu.23.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Offers Wide Autonomy"
wsu.23.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has offered us wide autonomy within the empire with a status similar to Bohemia. However, the decision is very unpopular among the UNRada, which is seen as unfair... all lives of the Ukrainians matter and were not for nothing."
wsu.23.a:0 "We cannot afford the war with Austrians now..."

wsu.24.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has agreed to recognize our independence, but only at a cost of joining their sphere. While technically we are independent, we will be limited in our foreign policy, but it will allow us to live peacefully for a while."
wsu.24.a:0 "That's the best we can get from them."

wsu.25.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Our Incorporation!"
wsu.25.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has demanded our incorporation into the Empire. This is a disgusting violation of our right of self-determination and we now feel bad we even allowed these negotiations to happen!"
wsu.25.a:0 "Are they crazy?"

wsu.26.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
wsu.26.d:0 "Surprisingly, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our terms."

wsu.30.a:0 "Very bad news."

wsu.31.t:0 "The Land Issue"
wsu.31.d:0 "The Land question should be solved as soon as possible! Most of the land in West Ukraine belongs to the noble Polish landlords since the medieval times and the poor peasants are in dire need of their rightful land. However, despite the liberal parties push for private land ownership, the leftists are actively lobbying the 'socialization' or 'nationalization' of land at least for now."
wsu.31.a:0 "Land should belong to state!"
wsu.31.b:0 "Land should belong to people!"

wsu.35.t:0 "Ukraine Reunited!"
wsu.35.d:0 "Due to our greatest advances against [UKR.GetNameDef], we managed to occupy Kyiv and soon their treacherous government was forced to surrender. Yevhen Petrushevych has proclaimed the restoration of the only true Ukrainian People's Republic and soon we will have to stabilize the nation."
wsu.35.a:0 "Great!"

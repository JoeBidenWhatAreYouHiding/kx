zagros.1.t:0 "The Zagros Confederation"
zagros.1.d:0 "When the Mostaghelun erupted, there was no better oppourtunity for the southern tribes of Iran to finally make their move. Originating as the Ettehād-e Jonub - the League of the South - an alliance of the southern tribes of Iran which had always felt dissatisfied with the central Tehran regime, it has seen grown into a powerful southern force, shielded by the Zagros mountains and economically stablised from the oil-fields within its territories.Ten long years have passed since its conflict with the now-abolished Qajar regime, and though they may appear united from the outside, there are certain elements from within this modern-day tribal confederation which may seek to bring the alliance to an end.\n\nIsmail Khan Qashqai, Ilkhani of the Qashqai tribe, leads this fragile union. His leadership, however, does not entail absolute rule - rather, it is a delicate balance of negotiation, persuasion, and tribal pride. The road ahead is uncertain. The Republic in Tehran will come eventually, and we cannot ignore the radicals in Orumiyeh any longer. One thing is assured - the snows of the mountains shall be stained with blood."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_PIERRE_RYCKMANS_DESC:0 "The Highborn Lord Pierre, 1st Graff Ryckmans, has served the Flandro-Wallonian government for most of his life, as has his family before him for generations back home in Flanders. Born in 1891, Ryckmans comes from a family of esteemed lawyers and politicians, with his father Alphonse serving as a prominent senator in the Flandro-Wallonian Senate as a member of the Catholic Party. His father’s views deeply impacted Ryckmans from a young age, going on to study philosophy at the Catholic University of Leuven before hopping around schools between Germany, Ireland, and Flanders-Wallonia before the horrors of the Weltkrieg began, inspiring him to voluntarily enlist. Originally assigned to the Yser Front, Ryckmans long held an idealized admiration for the Dark Continent and applied to transfer to the colonies for overseas service as soon as he was able. It was here on the battlefields of Africa that Ryckmans made a name for himself as a sound tactician and leader as he fought back against both European soldiers and Mwami warriors, paving the way for his future colonial career post-war. After briefly returning home to finish his law degree and to write and publish the first of his literary works and memoirs, Ryckmans returned to the Congo and was soon elected to become the mayor of Herminestadt - one of the Congo’s largest cities and the main administrative center in the colony. Now, having proven his effectiveness and worth, Pierre Ryckmans serves as Governor-General of the Congo Vrijstaat. Under his leadership, colonial rule shall be maintained at all costs as Ryckmans attempts to drag the ailing Vrijstaat into the modern era."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_CONGO_DESC:0 "Albert I is known by many monikers: Le Roi-Chevalier, Der Koning-Soldaat, Heir to Leopold, and the Exiled King of the Flandro-Wallonians. These titles and honorifics have been bequeathed to him by his people’s adoration, his Godsent birthright, and his valorant acts in the Weltkrieg; and yet this noble ‘Soldier King’ has languished in exile while a German pretender sits on his throne. With the collapse of the previous colonial order under the ‘stewardship’ of the Kaiser’s forces, the Congo Vrijstaat has once again fully returned to the hands of its rightful Flandro-Wallonian masters, free from German meddling for the first time in decades. With this return of the proven pre-Weltkrieg status-quo, the Frandro-Wallonian loyalists within the Vrijstaat made overtures to their exiled king, who has long lived in Canada with the bulk of the Entente exiles, welcoming the Knight King Albert I back to the lands of Leopold’s free state and the center of the once mighty Flandro-Wallonian colonial empire. Though still far from Brussels and his throne, Albert I, rightful King of the Flandro-Wallonians, shall use the Congo as his new staging ground as he and his forces gather their strength to finally overthrow the vile German-backed regime that has stolen his homeland and his birthright from him. The mistakes of the Weltkrieg will be undone as Albert readies to fight for his people and his nation against the wicked Hun for the second time in his honored life."
POLITICS_VON_EPP_DESC:0 "With a career forged in war and colonial conquest, few men are more fit to lead one of the Kaiser’s glorious Afrikan colonies than Franz Ritter von Epp. A Bavarian man through and through, Epp was born in Munich in 1868 to famous realist painter Rudolf Epp, but quickly departed from his father’s artistic pursuits and joined the Munich Military Academy after graduating from school, beginning his storied military career. First seeing life action during the Boxer Rebellion, he would later see multiple deployments across Africa and Asia, most notable of which was his role in the vicious war against the Herero and Namaqua peoples of Südwestafrika. After this long term of colonial service, Epp was drafted into the fires of the Weltkrieg, seeing action in Serbia, Romania, Italy, and France, displaying such valourous and heroic acts that he was knighted by the Kaiser himself following the end of the war. Since then, von Epp has received higher and higher positions throughout His Majesty’s empire, and has now found himself as Staathalter of all of Mittelafrika. Under his rule, German interests shall be paramount above all else as Dar-Es-Salaam draws closer to Berlin."

Since then, von Epp has received higher and higher positions throughout His Majesty’s empire, and has now found himself leading the colonial administration of the Congo. Under his rule German interests shall be paramount above all else as Leopoldville draws closer to Berlin."
POLITICS_LEO_PETILLON_DESC:0 "Léon ‘Léo’ Pétillon is a career civil-servant and once-staunch ally of Pierre Ryckmans, but following his predecessor’s fall from grace, Pétillon has risen to become the new Governor-General of the Congo. Born in 1903 in Esneux, Léo spent his youth slowly training to become a lawyer before joining the Ministry of the Colonies for colonial service in 1929. Since then, Pétillon steadily rose through the ranks of the colonial hierarchy due to his ties to chief ministers in the Flandro-Wallonian parliament and his sharp aptitude for colonial governance. With the fall of the previous cabinet, Pétillon was chosen as the natural successor to Ryckmans’ failed attempt at pseudo-military rule under the Force Publique, and with his technocratic beliefs established during his time as a lawyer and his staunch adherence to Catholicism well-known, the new Governor-General has been seen by many as the humanizing face the Vrijstaat has long sorely needed. Now, the people of the Congo watch Pétillon like a hawk, hoping to see if he is the blessing he truly seems to be."

KTG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap:0 "Abolish the Invisible Colour Gap"
KTG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap_desc:0 "While unlike the British or French colonies there never was a distinct colour gap in Congo, a glass ceiling blocked the Congolese from reaching high administrative or political positions.

KTG_Centre_Extra_Coutumiers_desc:0 "While the system of Chefferies worked well in the past, the growing population and the questionable loyalty of the cheffs has pushed the government to create their own economic centres on the countryside.

KTG_Technical_University_Herminestadt_desc:0 "Due to the large growth of the UMHK over the last years, they have offered the government a large amount of funds to help in the creation of a technical university in Herminestadt.

KTG_Access_To_The_Sea_desc:0 "Our economy is primarily based around the sale and export of the various resources and materials extracted from the rich Congo. For this to continue, sea access is vital, but yet there is an obstacle to this goal - there is but one large seaport in all of the Congo. Unfortunately, recent developments in Leopoldville have left our main port at Matadi non operational. We must find a way to export our goods or else our fragile economy could slip further into collapse."

KTG_Luanda_Port:0 "The Port of Luanda"
KTG_Luanda_Port_desc:0 "The Portuguese have long controlled swathes of Africa. Currently, they control the Angolese port of Luanda, one of the largest colonial ports in Wesern-Central Africa. With this in mind, the Portuguese would be an excellent trading partner to subside our lack of a domestic seaport, if they accept our offer. With access to the Portuguese’s naval infrastructure at Luanda, we shall be able to bypass the need to access Matadi at Leopoldville, allowing our economy to thrive once again."

Self-sufficiency, local cooperation with other African states, and constructing our own native industry shall be key goals for our new economy.  What few funds we have should be directed, in partnership with our allies, towards the exploitation of the natural bounty of this land, for our own profit.

KTG_Full_Integration:0 "Total Integration into Mittelafrika"
KTG_Full_Integration_desc:0 "Full-reintegration into Mittelafrika is preferable to the uncertainties of independence.

KTG_Increased_Shipping_Capacity:0 "Expand the Congolese Merchant Marine"

KTG_Congolese_Railroad_Expansion_desc:0 "Though we have endeavored greatly to build up the Congolese economy, our few cities and industrial centers are like islands dotting a sea of endless trees.

KTG_Diamond_Mines_Kivu_desc:0 "With our control over the region of Kivu being fully established, we have secured the exclusive right to exploit some of the world's most lucrative diamond mines. We should get started immediately and break ground on the known untapped deposits and seams while we expand the few current mines operating on-site. Additionally, we shall send new survey teams out into the surrounding jungles and hills to prospect for new sources. With these new diamond mines complimenting our already established gold and silver mining industries, the Congo shall become king of the mineral luxuries trade."

KTG_salvagingthearsenals_desc:0 "What little industry is still undamaged in our area of control must be used to produce and maintain weaponry for the war effort.

Though he started the Congo’s modernization and civilizing processes, turning the Congo into a profitable venture for rubber production, ivory sourcing, and mining, he did so through committing brutal acts against the native Congolese. Though harsh, Leopold II’s rule showed that in the Congo, profitable results required sacrifice, and so we will replicate his methods in a more modern and less barbaric way in order to further his civilizing mission here in the Congo."

From gold and silver to iron and uranium deposits to rubber tree forests that stretch for acres and underground deposits of oil and natural gas, the Congo is one of the most bountiful paradises on this planet - a true Eden on Earth. To ensure these resources are efficiently extracted and processed, the UMHK and other resource conglomerates in the Congo shall coalesce together into a central economic planning board, becoming an official arm of the state as the chief economic bureaucracy of the Congo.

Nearly 30,000 African soldiers fought for the Congo in that horrific war, and it was with these native lives that the Congo lived and died with. Once again, we must rely on this colony's immense population to fuel the coming war effort and fill out our divisions. We must conscript the natives to work both in the factories and to hold a gun on the frontline, for without their manpower, our crusade to retake Brussels is doomed to fail.

Primarily in Bas-Congo, these plantations already stretch for hundreds of acres, producing liquid cash with each bucket of sap collected.

KTG_German_Influence:0 "The Iron Cross Looms Over the Congo"
KTG_German_Influence_desc:0 "With their victory in the Weltkrieg, Flanders-Wallonia and the Congo were forced to swear subservience to the new world hegemon. Though the Flandro-Wallonian administration in the Congo was allowed to stay and the reign of the Vrijstaat allowed to continue, the Kaiserreich quickly began to sink its greedy teeth into this resource-rich primordial oasis. With each passing moment, the German Empire further digs its claws into the Congo ever deeper, furthering their influence and fulfilling their own ambitions at the cost of the long-standing Flandro-Wallonian dominance that has existed since Leopold’s regime. Despite their best efforts, however, the influence of these Flandro-Wallonian imperialists and settlers is waning fast. \n\nThis atmosphere of crumbling chaos has come to minorly benefit the Congo, supplying the Force Publique with weapons and the colonial administration with economic aid, but has also greatly destabilized the colony and the very foundations of Flandro-Wallonian rule while also greatly inflaming native tensions who continue to riot and strike against colonial rule. An end to this struggle for dominance must be reached if the Vrijstaat is to survive at all."

#Belgian-German recolonisation effort

ktg.20.t:0 "The mwami has seized control!"
ktg.20.d:0 "Just as the tax collectors were returning from the inland territories and the miners of the Union Minière were enjoying a well deserved peaceful Sunday afternoon, news arrived in the capital that the Mwami of the [ROOT.GetName] people had deposed the German governor, executed his associates and taken control over the province.\n\nWith most of the populace still unaware of these shocking developments and having relatively content relations with the Flemish-Wallonian administration, this comes as a huge shock to the colonials. For over 50 years, the word of the white man was law and every form of disobedience was punished severely. Now a native king of a small village has dared standing up to their command and taken power into his own hands.\n\nA friendly football competition between the Flemish-Wallonians and the Katangese was just underway when news hit the city of Herminestadt. At first the citizens can't believe what they are hearing and life continues as normal. In the Colonial headquarters, chaos has erupted with a split occuring between those that want to stay and fight to preserve that which they have built up for years and those that want to leave the continent as quickly as possible. The bishop of the city can been seen speaking with the head of Askari forces stationed in the city and Pierre Ryckmans, mayor of the city. Should they try and escape the country now that German rule has faltered or should they entrench themselves in the white quarter protected by the loyal Askari forces?"
ktg.20.a:0 "Order a mass evacuation of the colony!"
ktg.20.b:0 "The Flemish-Wallonian administration stays put."

ktg.21.t:0 "Alone on the Dark Continent"
ktg.21.d:0 "With Ryckmans giving the order to entrench in the city of Herminestadt, the Katangese population finally realised what was going on. While a certain part of the population see the rebellion and fall of German rule as their chance at liberation from European rule, the majority of the city's population is less convinced by the arguments of their brothers. While their life in the city has not been easy, many remember the days of their tribal past and the hardships those brought with them. European rule may have been fierce and often unjust, but with it came a certain degree of welfare that many no longer want to abandon and have thus rallied behind the banner of the colonial administration.\n\nTables, chairs, cupboards and more furniture is being dragged onto the streets establishing temporary barricades while citizens from the suburbs are being transferred to the city plaza. Arms and medical supplies, many of which dating back from the Belgian era, are being taken from the kazernes and beds are rolled into the Herminestadt hospital. While many of the men, women and children have no fighting experience, hundreds of young miners, factory workers and colonial employees are being forced to take up arms to defend their families and city from the Mwamis army. Out of a total population of around 45.000 citizens, 35.000 have barricaded themselves with the Flemish-Wallonian forces while the rest has fled the city and taken shelter in the nearby villages. Only small bands of seperatists now remain outside the fortified centre and are plundering and sacking the outskirts of the city, taking their revenge on the évolués and properties of the whites in preparation of the arrival of the Mwamis forces."

ktg.22.t:0 "Mwami forces approach the city"
ktg.22.d:0 "Three days have passed since the killing of the governor and the collapse of German rule and forces of the Mwami are marching on Herminestadt to once and for all destroy any remainder of Colonial rule. Many of the villages along the road to Herminestadt have already picked their sides and have either sworn loyalty or have been sacked by his forces. Village after village the Mwami approaches the capital, whites from all surrounding villages and labourers of the Flemish-Wallonian companies have travelled to the city seeking refuge behind its barricade. Word of the resistance has been sent to Flanders-Wallonia to inform them of the Mwamis march but with infrastructure in shammbles after the Collapse and roving parties roaming the Congo basin, it has become apparent that no European aid will arrive in time."
ktg.22.a:0 "Finalise all preparations."

ktg.23.t:0 "The siege begins"
ktg.23.d:0 "On the evening of the first week, the mwami has finally reached the city. With rain still pouring down as if God himself has opened the flood gates, life inside the fortifications is becoming tougher with the day.\n\nUnder cover of darkness a perimeter is established surrounding the city by the Mwami while scouting parties are sent inside the outskirts to investigate the fortifications made by the Colonials. While the mwami is outnumbered by the population of Herminestadt, his army consists of trained warriors and disgruntled veterans from the East-Afrika offensive while the defenders only have a small 1000 soldiers armed with Weltkrieg weapons from the Force Publique and a couple of European officers. To frigthen the defenders, the Mwami has commanded a thousand fires to be lit around the city and has initiated a war chant dating back from the Lunda war, to show the colonials that the Stairs Expedition will be avenged with fire and blood."
ktg.23.a:0 "Tighten the perimeter!"

ktg.24.t:0 "Battle for Herminestadt"
ktg.24.d:0 "At 8.00 the Mwami finally gives the signal citizens of Herminestadt have anxiously awaited during the night. Horns are sounded, shouting intensifies and the first charge commences. The assaulting force, numbering over 5000 trained warriors from his capital in Bunkeya, storm through the main avenue while deserted Askari warriors cover their attack."
ktg.24.a:0 "Fix bayonets! Repel them at all cost!"

ktg.25.t:0 "The Mwami falls back"
ktg.25.d:0 "For over 12 hours now, the battle for Herminestadt has been raging with heavy casualties on both sides forcing both parties to fall back for now and cut their losses. While the blockade at the north side of Kamalondo got overrun just after the morning, a concentrated effort of German machine guns, ex-soldiers of the Force Publique and an armed citizen militia was able to reconquer the point just before the evening, thus preventing a major breakthrough in the neighbourhood. While much of the Southern suburbs got overrun in the assault, with parts of the city set ablaze to cover the retreat, the fight did not provide the Mwami the decisive victory he desired and needed for the morale of his soldiers. Even though casualties are hard to estimate with certain parts of the city still in active combat, Ryckmans has estimated casualties on his side to number upwards of 3000. Casualties in the loyal Askari force were quite minimal but the loss of squads in the reconquest of Kamalondo are taking their toll on the already limited force."
ktg.25.a:0 "The future is looking bleak."

ktg.26.t:0 "The Assault recommences"
ktg.26.d:0 "Throughout the rest of the week, the Mwami furiously resumed his attacks on the city, each subsequent attack proving less effective than the last. Seeing the resolve of the Lubumbashi populace and the firm leadership by the Colonial administration, desertion has started to spread through the ranks of the Mwamin causing severe issues to his supply lines and the morale of the remaining warriors. At last the Mwami, sees no other solution than to offer a ceasefire to Pierre Ryckmans. Upon agreement, he offers the Colonials the right to retain their autonomy and power over the city of Herminestadt, control over the mines of the UMHK and a continuation of the pre-Collapse policy as long as he is allowed to rule the Yeke kingdom from his seat in Bunkeya as he pleases."
ktg.26.a:0 "Accept the Ceasefire."

ktg.27.t:0 "End of the siege"
ktg.27.d:0 "With the last of the Mwamis forces leaving the city, the devastation caused by the siege has finally become apparent. Hundreds of houses are burned down, streets are blockaded by debris and thousands of brave Congolese and colonials lay unburied on the battlefield. This fight may be won but the recovery has only just begun."
ktg.27.a:0 "Colonial order is restored!"

ktg.29.t:0 "Appointement of the new colonial governor"
ktg.29.d:0 "After the passing of the previous governor in the chaos of the Mittel-Afrikan collapse, a new governor has to be appointed to rule over the Katanga province. While the Mwami will remain as the official ruler, he will only be used as a titular chieftain while the real power is held by the Colonial office and the UMHK. Due to his steadfast leadership and dedication in the siege, Pierre Ryckmans has unanimously been elected by the Colonial administration until further elections can be held. Although Ryckmans has showed contrary to many of his predecessors that he cares about the native population, the Katangese citizens are worried that a continuation of the old Belgian colonial policy is on hands."
ktg.29.b:0 "Good Luck Pierre Ryckmans!"

ktg.28.t:0 "Riots of Herminestadt"
ktg.28.d:0 "With the Mwami approaching the city, many of the formerly loyal inhabitants see their chance at true independence free from White oppression. Mass rioting breaks out with houses of colonials being plundered and set ablaze. Greek and Italian restaurants and shops are being set alight and the overseers at UMHK decapitated on the streets."

#Flanders-Wallonia
ktg.40.t:0 "Envoy from Katanga"
ktg.40.d:0 "Through a vast communications network sustained by the catholic church in Congo, news has reached us over the situation of our former colony. Through clever use of the Force Publique and by utilising the population of Herminestadt, the colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans was able to hold on to colonial rule. Now, a formal request has been made by his government for support from our country. In the chaos that ensued after Black Monday, most of our citizens living and working in the Congo were able to escape to Herminestadt where the central power of our mining operations is located. Reports from the missions indicate that around 10.000 of our colonials were able to retreat to Herminestadt where they proclaimed Pierre Ryckmans as their colonial governor. While our government isn't able to launch a full scale offensive to liberate our citizens, the colonials have requested that we sent them weapons, ammunition and food supplies so they can hold off the African war chiefs."

ktg.42.t:0 "The motherland hesitates"
ktg.42.d:0 "While there is definitely political pressure from within the government to support the Flemish-Wallonian citizens (and more importantly the mines), they have decided to await a German response before fully commiting themselves to our cause."

ktg.43.d:0 "News has reached us that the Colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans in Katanga has requested Flemish-Wallonian aid in the rebuilding of their capital and continued support for their army. With around 10.000 Flemish-Wallonians in the colony, their government has no choice but to support their fellow countrymen. For now, they have however hold off awaiting German response. This could be our opportunity to win their support in our recolonisation efforts if we offer our ports and infrastructure to their mission."

ktg.45.t:0 "Further requests from Herminestadt"
ktg.45.d:0 "While our previous shipments have (mostly) safely arrived in Herminestadt, the colonial government has requested us to sent military personnel as well to help in training and expanding the Force Publique.

ktg.50.d:0 "After the collapse of Mittel-Afrika, the remaining colonial rule was heavily challenged by the [ROOT.GetName] Mwami untill he was finally defeated in Herminestadt and reduced to a titular king. Due to our ambitions to take over the region and our access to the ports of the Atlantic Ocean, the colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans has offered us a trade agreement where we would allow them to use our ports and railroads in exchange for heavy tarrifs. While this could be a profitable agreement, we have to keep our expansion plans in mind. Supporting a Reichspakt colony could drastically reduce our chances of conquest."

ktg.70.d:0 "For the first time in colonial history, free and fair elections open to both Black and White citizens of the Congo will decide on the new mayor of Herminestadt and with it, the de facto governor of the Congo. The Catholic missions have proposed that Pierre Ryckmans continue his term while the large companies, like the UMHK, urge the voters to choose Jules Cousin as leader of the city. A new African workers party, under the lead of Léonard Mpoyi, has also announced their bid for the position as well and have been seen swaying voters among the cité indigène."

#Ryckmans vs Mwami

ktg.71.t:0 "Ryckmans Consolidates Colonial Power"
ktg.71.d:0 "The Mwami and his forces have long been a thorn in the side of the Vrijstaat, but Pierre Ryckmans has long fought to extinguish this native movement and capture its troublesome tribal king. Though Ryckmans has widely succeeded in his first goal, with the Mwami’s forces now largely on the run and hiding out in Katanga, the Mwami still evades his capture and has joined his fleeing troops. \n\nAfter this victory over the Mwami, the reinstated colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans has proceeded on their path to consolidate the colonial regime. As the Mwami licks his wounds in Bunkeya and with the support of the Herminestadt and Leopoldville populations, a formal letter has been sent to the Mwami informing him that his ‘services’ are no longer necessary for Katanga and that he has been officially stripped of all his titles and stance as a paramount chief. This will surely upset his most loyal followers, but after their defeat, it shall hopefully only require some careful precision strikes by the Force Publique and Flemish-Wallonian special forces to extinguish their flame of resistance."
ktg.71.a:0 "Ryckmans is free to consolidate his rule in Katanga and across the Congo."

ktg.72.t:0 "The Mwami Refuses"
ktg.72.d:0 "Word has returned from Bunkeya where the Mwami, outraged by our demands, has ripped apart our letter stripping him of his titles and has instead given the order to remobilize his forces. Due to their loss in Herminestadt earlier this year, his troops are widely undersupplied and lacking in even the most basic of equipment. Meanwhile, the Force Publique, though still widely armed with Weltkrieg-era weapons, has been preparing their assault unit while paracommandos and marines from Flanders-Wallonia landed in Herminestadt and Leopoldville earlier today."
ktg.72.a:0 "We March On Bunkeya!"

ktg.73.t:0 "The Mwami Has Fled Once Again!"
ktg.73.d:0 "Realising that his position in Bunkeya was indefensible, the Mwami has given the order for his forces to retreat to the old fortress at Munema where they will entrench themselves and wait for our forces to arrive. Meanwhile, the first trucks loaded with our troops have arrived in Bunkeya and the city has been mostly secured. A temporary airstrip has been created to accommodate the incoming Flandro-Wallonian paracommandos while a new plan of action is being formalised by the general staff of the Force Publique."
ktg.73.a:0 "Offer the Mwami one last chance to surrender."

ktg.74.t:0 "Final Assault on Munema"
ktg.74.d:0 "Honouring his legacy, the Mwami had decided to refuse our last-minute offer to end this bloodshed and had chosen to die fighting the colonials like his ancestor Msiri did during the Stairs Expedition. In response to this decision and our forces growing anger over the loss of their fellow comrades in the Force Publique, General Tombeur had given the order to bomb the Munema fortress and follow up with a combined push by Flemish-Wallonian paracommandos and Force Publique foot soldiers. The ancient fortress was surely not at all capable of resisting this type of modern, combined warfare and was expected to fall within hours. However, in our foolish overconfidence, we had ordered our forces to wait to advance for the moment our bombs stopped falling on the old fortress, and in this brief window, the Mwami and a small detachment of his vanguard and closest advisors were able to slip away in old tunnels beneath the surface. The Mwami’s forces are routed, but this slippery chief has escaped our grasp once more. Regardless, his movement is too fractured to be any threat now."
ktg.74.a:0 "So falls the house of Msiri."

ktgfla.1.d:0 "Due to Belgian influence and Catholic missionaries from West-Flanders, football is slowly becoming the most important religion in Katanga. Organised by père Raphaël de la Kethulle football matches and small championships are held throughout Herminestadt. Through growing mining cités and the continued education policy of our governor, the père hopes to improve social promotion of the Africans and has requested the government to further expand his vision by the creation of the Association Sportive Congolaise."
ktgfla.1.a:0 "Approve the organisation."

ktgfla.2.t:0 "Recognition from the Flemish-Wallonian Football Association"
ktgfla.2.d:0 "The FWFA has eagerly observed the growing popularity of football and Katanga and has decided to pump further funding into the Association Sportive Congolaise, upgrading its infrastructure, providing better support and even allowing for promotion into the Flemish-Wallonian cup. To further strengthen the bonds between the two organisations, the Beerschot club has announced their visit to Herminestadt to face off against the best of our nation. To show off the successful return of the colonial regime, plans for a new station are being drafted named after Adalbert I."

ktgfla.3.t:0 "King Adalbert Stadium"
ktgfla.3.d:0 "Built under the careful supervision of père de la Kethulle and funded by the Association Sportive Congolaise, hundreds of workers have been building for months to finish the prestige project of the Colonial government. Due to the père hundreds of Katangese school children have volunteered to aid in the construction as well hoping to one day be able to become world stars and play in the Flemish-Wallonian league. Built for over 50.000 supporters the stadium is supposed to become the centre of the Herminestadt sport associations with an athletics club planned as well."

ktgfla.4.t:0 "Herminestadt-Beerschot"
ktgfla.4.d:0 "Finally the big day has approached, Beerschot has flown from Brussel to Herminestadt to play against the Herminestadt club who was able to defeat Bunkeya in a close 4-3 last month. Accompanied by loud music and even a performance of the Force Publique orchestra, the stadium has started to fill up with more than 50.000 Katangese already inside and more than 20.000 waiting outside. With a burning sun shining on the supporters, the match began with a goal from Mokuna against the Flemish-Wallonian keeper. The Beerschot attackers were able to turn the tide around at the 42 minute mark scoring two goals against the failing Herminestadt defence, placing the score 2-1 at half-time. During the second half, three more attacks by Beerschot were blocked by the Herminestadt defence and Mokuna was able to score another goal at the 76 minute placing the final score at 2-2. Ecstatic with the beautiful performance their team was able to present the Flemish-Wallonians, celebrations continued deep into the night together with the Beerschot supporters."

ktgfla.5.d:0 "After getting caught for stealing a bed, 7 chairs, 5 tables and even a washbasin, Muhemili Abeli has been brought to trial for repeated theft and trade with the black market. She countered that due to the reforms pushed by UMHK after the Black Monday scandal, many of the workers can't afford their life necessities anymore and that she resulted in stealing to sustain her family. Support for her case has been growing in the cité indigène where many more miners have fallen on tough times after the firing of 300 miners last year."

ktgfla.6.t:0 "Further scandals in the UMHK"
ktgfla.6.d:0 "A study in the Herminestadt paper has been published outlining the atrocities committed by the UMHK against the Hutu population of Rwanda. By promising them wealth and success, many unemployed men have travelled to Herminestadt to be employed in the mines. Insisting that they are naturally protected against low oxygen environments due to their mountainous home and don't need the 'Chambres à Vapeur' to acclimate to the situation down below, many of these men have died from loss of oxygen or malaria and secretly buried away from the general public. Now the study has leaked out to the population of Herminestadt resulting in a massive strike against the UMHK until better working conditions can be guaranteed. Over in the Colonial government, debate is also occurring over the replacement of the Chefs in the mine of question to deter exploding anti-colonialist thoughts."
ktgfla.6.a:0 "Fire all the Overseers."

ktgfla.7.t:0 "Conflict within the UMHK"
ktgfla.7.d:0 "In continuation of the pre-Weltkrieg colonial policy, the UMHK has once again dedicated itself to a combination of complex bureaucracy and a general patronising attitude towards it's workers. Due to the expansion of the corporation over the years however this combination is no longer viable for the entire firm leading to loopholes and unjustified punitive measures against the wrong miner. After the economic crisis of 1936, many of the miners are now completely at the mercy of the company, depending on them for food, social facilities, accomodation. To cut back their losses, the UMHK decided to cut back spending for these facilities, causing a general decline in the welfare of the Katangese and increasing calls for better loans and houses now that the economy is back in upswing."
ktgfla.7.a:0 "Discuss with the UMHK board of directors."

ktgfla.8.t:0 "Workshop burned down"
ktgfla.8.d:0 "Near the Ruashi mines, fires have burned down multiple workshops causing the work to come to a complete stop. It looks like it was a deliberate act of arsonry by some of the workers as a protest against the low wages and old housing facilities."

ktgfla.9.t:0 "UMHK demolishes a cemetery"
ktgfla.9.d:0 "In their recent expansion of the cobalt mines in South-Katanga, a group of Flemish-Wallonian construction engineers has accidentally destroyed a local cemetery causing outrage amongst the population who claim that the colonials have no respect for their culture and traditions and are purely here for profit. In Herminestadt, the situation is escalating with multiple shops and cafes run by colonials getting thrashed and a general strike in the UMHK. The colonial government is debating whether to take this opportunity to finally complete the nationalisation of the UMHK, forcing the company to directly change its policy and offer better working conditions to the native workforce."

Due to a planned visit to Bunkeya however, Pierre Ryckmans wasn't able to meet with the strikers and has sent his deputy Amour Maron to handle the situation. When Léonard Mpoyi and his colleagues however started presenting their evidence to the gathered council, Amour Maron shot the man next to Mpoyi point blank and ordered the Force Publique to open fire on the strikers. Over 50 miners were shot dead with hundreds of wounded. The strike has been quelled but for how long...?"

It's unclear who could have targeted the much adored père who was responsible for the introduction of football in the colony but reports indicate that a radical member of the [ROOT.GetName] tribe may have detonated the bomb to express his distrust of the ever increasing power of the Catholic Church.

Within our own borders, various seperatist movements have taken the opportunity to revolt against our rightful rule! To the north in Coquilhatville, a mercenary state rises to oppose our rule, while to the east, the Kivu Clique and the native Congolese seek to throw off the shackles of colonialism. Seizing on this moment of weakness, Leopoldsville to the west has seceded, taking our only sea access with them, while the Miners Union of the south jungles have declared autonomy from our administration to further their own interests.

Once a bustling center of trade and culture during the reign of the Yeke Kingdom, Bunkeya has long since stagnated in its fall from prosperity. The rule of the joint Flandro-Wallonian-German mission has cast a dark cloud over the colony. Though these Europeans brought the light of civilization, with all of its accompanying technologies and accouterments, they have also brought death and decay. The colony and its native people are overworked by its overseers who use the natives as cheap labor, harvesting the vast natural and mineral riches of the Congo. Though this system has created vast amounts of material wealth for the Flandro-Wallonians, and for Mitteleuropa as a whole, it has also drawn the ire of many natives in the colony. Most prominent among the dissidents of the colonial regime is the Mwami and his loyal followers. The Mwami is the local, rightful ruler to these lands in the eyes of the natives, and his insurrectionary activities continue to be a thorn in the side of our administration and threaten the very stability of our stake here. Before it is too late, a direction must be chosen if the colony is to survive. Whether we crush the Mwami or decide to tolerate their existence, we must be certain it is the correct path. Despite the growing dark clouds on the horizon, both here in the colony and back home on the European mainland, our colonial government must steer itself on a direct and measured course if it is to survive the coming storm."

For months, Pierre Ryckmans and his administration have fought tooth and nail with the Mwami of the southern Congo in Garanganze. Time and time again, peace talks have almost succeeded, only for such hopes to be dashed by another rise in violent conflict: the region has not known peace or stability for what feels like ages. Finally, through either compromise or force, the last of the Mwami’s forces have been quelled, and it seems peace has been brought to the Congo once more.

In recognition of their great and patriotic service to the Flanders-Wallonian colonial empire, the Évolues of the Congo colony have finally been awarded for their long and unwavering service. Their reward shall take the form of better housing, better pay, and greater freedoms and rights within the colony. They will also be granted representatives in the colonial congress who, while holding no voting power, can act as observers so the native voice can at least be heard in colonial meetings. Though our more cynical citizens see this as no more than a master petting its obedient dogs, others view this as a small but important step on the road to African self-determination."

conbel.7.t:0 "Heinous Treachery!"
conbel.7.d:0 "It seems our recent dealings with the Mwami have angered the more conservative elements of our colonial administration. With the news of our new peace deal with the natives reverberating throughout the colony, it seems the mining concerns and their lobbyists and cronies in the capital have risen up and declared our current government dead. These rebels claim the current administration has kowtowed to the Mwami and his followers for too long and seek to continue their operations outside of our oversight. They have seized parts of the capital as well as their mining and harvesting operations across the colony and refuse to deescalate the situation. In response, our cabinet has come up with three possible solutions to our problems. The first and most obviously detrimental option is to simply do nothing and let these rebels continue their operations in peace, with proponents for this plan claiming tensions will cool in the coming weeks and that direct military action would be too hasty or drastic. Alternatively, the main opposition to this plan is to ride out and crush this insurrection now before it can grow out of hand. However, among this faction, two different camps have emerged. The first camp seeks to use only the colonial garrison force to crush these rebels, with its followers putting full faith in our garrison to be able to defeat these well-funded partisans. The other camp, seemingly seeing the writing on the wall, has declared that only with Mwami cooperation under a united front can these rebels be fully crushed. The debate raged far into the next morning but by the end of the conference, a clear victor stood among the factions."

As the dust settles and the smoke clears, it seems we are the last men standing in this great Congolese Civil War. Now victorious, our forces may lick their wounds as we work to rebuild our nation that lies nestled in the heart of the Dark Continent. While moving towards reconstruction, the question of our international alignment has come up numerous times, and many in our administration feel that we will need allies in order to maintain order and security. However, a small, stalwart clique in our government still maintains that the Congo needs no ally or hegemon, and that our best possible future lies in our hands and our hands alone."

conbel.10.t:0 "A New Governor-General for the Congo?"
conbel.10.d:0 "With the ever-destabilizing situation growing worse in our Vrijstaat with each passing moment, the people of our colony have increasingly called for a new Governor-General election to be held. With faith in Ryckmans’ regime faltering with each misstep in policy or each new native riot that breaks out, many within the colonial administration and settler population wish to wipe clean the current administration and replace it with a more competent one. However, Ryckmans has long stood as a stalwart defender of Congolese interests over favoring either Berlin or Brussels, and if he were to be voted out, the Vrijstaat would likely greatly swing towards one of these two benefactors for aid and legitimacy. \n\nTo replace Ryckmans stands two main alternatives, each pursuing their own agendas. Fighting for increased German interests and control in the Congo is the famed Franz Ritter von Epp, hero of the Weltkrieg and Knight of the German Empire. Under his rule, the Vrijstaat would work towards closer cooperation and even possible full integration into the wider Mittelafrikan patchwork itself, giving the Kaiserreich full access to the Congo’s riches. Alternatively, the Flandro-Wallonian candidate is someone far less controversial than this Kraut - the Force Publique commander Léo Pétillon. Pétillon stands as a staunch pro-Flandro-Wallonian nationalist and minor technocrat - the perfect scion to unleash upon this unruly colony. Whoever is chosen, they will be shouldered with the immense responsibility of administering the Dark Heart of Africa."

With this decision rearing its ugly head, we must make a final choice: do we return to the arms of our Vrijstaat’s founders, the Belgians, or is it finally time for the Congo to carve its own path out of these dark jungles and into the future."

Long standing as one of the only profitable ventures in all of Africa, a return to colonial rule is hoped to be a return to form for the Vrijstaat. With the continuation of colonialist policies, the Congo’s resources will be further exploited and its treasures continuously tapped for all they are worth, for the most basic aspect of colonialism and imperialism is profit.

No longer shall Brussels or Berlin pull the strings of the Vrijstaat, for the Congo has been liberated once and for all from foreign meddling and imperialist interests. We are Congolese, one and all, and we have earned our right to self rule through spilling our own blood, sweat, and tears on the thicketed grounds of this primordial jungle. Though we have lost many of our comrades along the way, we finally have assured that their lives were not lost in vain, and with our independence truly secured, we can ensure that true Congolese never die!"

By using the Congo as a springboard, we shall launch a righteous crusade in which will reconquer our homeland and our King’s throne from the clutches of the Hohenzollern pretender Adalbert and the Kaiserreich.

From Leopoldville to Haut-Katanga, Force Publique detachments and settler militias wage war against the few remaining German holdouts still left infecting our pristine Eden. At the head of this vile imperialist serpent is the infamous Franz Ritter von Epp, the Kaiser’s highest official in the Vrijstaat, who has ruled over the Congo since Governor-General Ryckmans was replaced. Despite his power, prestige, and links to the German Empire, von Epp has still been increasingly pushed back as his influence and power wanes in this atmosphere of rising chaos and violence. The Congo has reached a fever pitch of anti-German sentiment, and now even the dark, twisting jungles can’t hide these Krauts now. The Iron Cross over Africa is faltering, and soon the Congo shall truly and finally be freed of this Hunnic spectre. The age of the German Congo is over!"
conbel.18.a:0 "We have taken back our paradise from the Krauts!"

conbel.19.t:0 "The Fate of the Black Heart of Mittelafrika"
conbel.19.d:0 "With the rule of the new Governor-General Franz Ritter von Epp, the Deutshes Kongo has been slowly forged into a bastion of the Kaiser’s influence in Africa, steeling the dark heart of Africa from the decadent and naive forces that have long tried to tame these wilds for decades. The foolish Flandro-Wallonians could not hope to handle this chaos-filled primordial paradise, and as such they have lost their mandate to rule over the Congo to our more able administration. \n\n However, with the Epp regime now thoroughly cemented in their position as the new hegemons of the Congo, a final choice on the future of this Eden must be made. Long has this region been a hotbed for separatism, anti-colonialism, and general unrest between both the various native groups and the colonists themselves. To disrupt this carefully-balanced status quo would be suicide to our new regime, or at least many of our more cautious ministers and generals feel so, and so we coulld heed their warnings and merely continue the rule of the old Congo Colony under a the new moniker of the Kongo Freistaat, reserving our autonomy and nominally still accepting the co-rule of our Flandro-Wallonian allies. Alternatively, the far more fervent loyalists, diehard monarchists, and other dedicated ministers within our camp instead seek to go with an opposite approach. These loyalists instead hope to merge the Congo into the wider Mittelafrikan megacolony, integrating Leopoldville directly with Dar-Es-Salaam, and fully uniting the central expanse of Africa under the Iron Cross of the Kaiserreich. \n\nDistinct from these two options however exists a third camp, championed by von Epp himself, who instead seek a middle-ground option. Seeking to cast-off the shared rule of the Flandro-Wallonians, who have proven all to clearly to be poor colonial leaders and incapable of ruling over the Congo, and to instead create a new, purely Afro-German state at the center of this Dark Continent to serve as the new, Germanized crown jewel of the Kaiser’s African ambitions. Under this plan, von Epp would rise as the new Staathalter of a unified and autonomous Deutscher Zentralafrikanischer Staat, finally freeing the Congo from the shackles of lesser rulers and races, and introducing the full might of German culture and governance to these lands while keeping a separate and distinct identity from wider Mittelafrika. Whatever the choice may be, the future of the Congo shall be dictated by the Kaiser as the Dark Heart of Africa falls sway under the Iron Eagle of the Reich."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "The king of White Ruthenia Uladzimir von Hohenzollern is not the kind of man one expects for such a job. Born Waldemar Wilhelm Ludwig Friedrich Viktor Heinrich von Hohenzollern, son of Prince Heinrich of Prussia, nephew of the Kaiser, nothing destined him to become king of White Ruthenia, at least until the German victory in the Weltkrieg. After the abolition of the Belarusian People's Republic, Uladzimir's father became the king of the country, he did his best to fight against illiteracy and tried to modernize the country during his reign, he died on April 20, 1929 with his son ascending to his throne.\n\nUladzimir is generally seen as a weak monarch, although loving his people, he is considered a man with little experience in governmental matters. With a reputation as a cowardly and indecisive man, his many bouts of hemophilia only make his situation worse and prevent him from making efforts for his country. One would think that this situation would lead to the BSDP-dominated Duma taking the lead in the political process, but this is not the case, as much of the executive power is held by the pro-German PNP Prime Minister Vasyl Zacharka at the expense of the King. With popular discontent on the rise, calls for a return to democracy and even the establishment of a republic increasing, socialists lurking in the shadows and his brother eyeing the throne greedily, the King's position is increasingly precarious.\n\nUladzimir knows that he will have to act sooner or later in some way, one can only wonder how."
POLITICS_SIGISMUND_DESC:0 "" #to rewrite later
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_MONBOL_DESC:0 "Uladzimir, King of the People's Kingdom of White Ruthenia, the Monarch of the Proletariat, the Protector of the Peasants, so many extravagant titles are attributed to him, yet the reality is known to all, the King is only a pawn of the KBP.  Uladzimir tried to do his best, to start a process of democratization of his country in order to give the power back to the people and the Duma, conscientiously reducing his power himself, loving his people, he gave them the gift of democracy. The people did not fail to express themselves in the elections, but the results shocked many, as the socialists, whom Uladzimir had previously re-legalized, won the election. The king and many expected the monarchy to be abolished as soon as possible by the new government, while the king, exhausted and plagued by frequent hemophilia attacks, had already planned to return to Germany, but this was not to be.\n\nWith the main purpose of preventing an aggression of the Reichpakt, the socialists decided to proclaim the People's Kingdom of White Ruthenia, a Bolshevik monarchy, a first in history, while keeping Uladzimir, nephew of the Kaiser, nominally at its head. In reality, the People's King does not spend his days governing anything, not having the power to do so, but only signing any document brought to his office by the KBP men. Uladzimir feels broken and humiliated, surrounded by men who keep him in power only by necessity, hating him and mocking him behind his back.\n\nSometimes he wonders during these long days of 'governance' if he should have listened to his brother before it was too late."

whiteruthenia.2.t:0 "Rethinking Our Place In the Reichspakt."
whiteruthenia.2.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] has called a secret cabinet to debate our continued stance on the Reichspakt. While supporting Germany in their war against Syndicalism has gained us little, leaving the alliance would remove our protection from other threats such as a resurgent Russia. Several ministers have proposed that we leave the Reichspakt and try to court the Russians with an alliance directly while a few others are demanding we become isolationist. What should we do?"
whiteruthenia.2.a:0 "We should ally with the Lithuanians."
whiteruthenia.2.b:0 "Try to ally with Russia."
whiteruthenia.2.c:0 "Stay loyal to the Germans."
whiteruthenia.2.e:0 "We need no outside help!"

whiteruthenia.3.t:0 "[WHR.GetAdjective] Alliance?"
whiteruthenia.3.d:0 "A secretive envoy from the [WHR.GetAdjective] government has come to us offering not only to leave Germany's Reichspakt bloc, but also a military alliance with us. While it would certainly be good to stand with our Slavic brothers, Germany's reaction to the loss of one of their key eastern allies could lead to a counter-response and even possibly war. What should we do?"
whiteruthenia.3.a:0 "Accept the offer!"
whiteruthenia.3.b:0 "Leave the White Rus to their own fate."
whiteruthenia.3.c:0 "We shall reintegrate them by force."

whiteruthenia.4.t:0 "White Ruthenia Abandons the Reichspakt for Russia"
whiteruthenia.4.d:0 "The treacherous White Ruthenians under their new king Žyhimont has left the Reichspakt. Their ambassador in Berlin formally tendered a letter to the Reichstag claiming that White Ruthenia is a sovereign nation able to make its own decisions. Even more shocking, White Ruthenia has gone ahead and entered a formal alliance with the Russians. This outrageous betrayal has torn asunder our entire defensive plan for the East in the face of the expansionist Russian threat. While some officials are calling for calm senior members of the general staff are itching to go to war, convinced that we can defeat the White Ruthenia before any fighting in the west begins."
whiteruthenia.4.a:0 "They were useless anyway."
whiteruthenia.4.b:0 "We shall crush these upstarts!"

whiteruthenia.5.t:0 "White Ruthenia Abandons the Reichspakt"
whiteruthenia.5.d:0 "The treacherous White Ruthenians under their new king Žyhimont has left the Reichspakt. Their ambassador in Berlin formally tendered a letter to the Reichstag claiming that White Ruthenia is a sovereign nation able to make its own decisions. Even more shocking, White Ruthenia has gone ahead and entered a formal alliance with the Russians, abandoning our military effort in its time of need. This outrageous betrayal has torn asunder our entire defensive plan for the East in the face of the expansionist Russian threat. While some officials are calling for calm senior members of the general staff are itching to go to war, convinced that the loss of our eastern ally is worth diverting troops away from the Syndicalist war to address."
whiteruthenia.5.a:0 "Leave the fools to it then."
whiteruthenia.5.b:0 "Begin preparations for punitive action!"

whiteruthenia.6.t:0 "Fall Jungingen"

whiteruthenia.6.a:0 "Send in the troops!"
whiteruthenia.6.b:0 "This was a mistake."




whiteruthenia.29.t:0 "Alliance Offer From [WHR.GetName]"
whiteruthenia.29.d:0 "The new government of [WHR.GetName] has sent us a message expressing his desire to ally with us. Žyhimont is not only a German but also a Hohenzollern, which means that our dedication to our anti-Germanism policy would be questioned. However, we are alone and any allies are better than none. It is likely that the Germans will not let us remain free as it may undermine the unity of the Reichspakt alliance, so perhaps we should consider this offer seriously."
whiteruthenia.29.a:0 "An alliance is in both of our interests."
whiteruthenia.29.b:0 "No. They cannot help us."
whiteruthenia.36.t:0 "Nationalist Revolt in the East"
whiteruthenia.36.d:0 "Horrible news! Within two days Nationalists in both Lithuania and White Ruthenia have seized their respective governments and abandoned the Reichspakt! To make matters worse they have also formally allied with one other, clearly intended to act in opposition against us. With the possibility of a brutal conflict to reestablish control over the East, it is not likely the German people will be supportive of military action. What should we do?"
whiteruthenia.36.a:0 "We must stem the tide of rebellion."
whiteruthenia.36.b:0 "Intervening would be too costly..."
whiteruthenia.30.t:0 "Black Monday hits White Ruthenia!"
whiteruthenia.30.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the value of the Berlin Stock Exchange suddenly collapsed, wiping out the value of hundreds of companies and devastating markets across German-dominated Europe. Now the effects of the shock have finally begun to wash over White Ruthenia. Dozens of prominent companies have fallen into insolvency or shed most of their work-force, the White Ruthenian Rubieĺ is losing value, and our exports are falling off a cliff. Any foreigners with cash left standing wouldn't touch our economy with a barge pole."
whiteruthenia.30.a:0 "Damn those investors!"
whiteruthenia.31.t:0 "Ostwall Overhaul"
whiteruthenia.31.d:0 "With the Russian armed forces emerging from years of neglect and becoming a fearsome force once again, it is high time for us to improve our somewhat diminished border defences. Our top military leaders have petitioned the central government to devote extra funding to improving existing fortifications along the border with Russia, known as the Ostwall. Once fully restored, such massive fortifications will surely help to stop any kind of Russian assault."
whiteruthenia.31.a:0 "Fund it!"




whiteruthenia.32.t:0 "Ostwall Supply Depots"
whiteruthenia.32.d:0 "A series of new reinforced supply depots have been constructed, solving one of the most pressing vulnerabilities in the design of the White Ruthenian section of the Ostwall. With ammunition dumps far better protected from enemy artillery and commando raids, our defences have been strengthened immeasurably. Should we stop here, or continue rebuilding the defences?"
whiteruthenia.32.a:0 "Further improve our defences!"

whiteruthenia.33.t:0 "Ostwall Anti-Tank Defences"
whiteruthenia.33.d:0 "Construction finished today on a new network of major anti-tank defences capable of posing a major threat to Russian armoured cavalry. The Ostwall has traditionally relied upon the outdated assumption that enemy tanks would support infantry and attack in small numbers, however modern military thinking makes clear that relying on this assumption would be foolish. An elaborate labyrinth of dragons' teeth and mines will go a long way to protecting our border. Some generals believe that we have expanded the Ostwall enough, but we could go further."
whiteruthenia.33.a:0 "Further improve our defences!"

whiteruthenia.34.t:0 "Ostwall Casement Bunkers Restored"
whiteruthenia.34.d:0 "Today our diligent engineers finished upgrading the various machine gun nests and bunkers along the line. New lines of fire have been created making the Ostwall far more lethal to approaching infantry and the bunkers themselves have been cased in new reinforced concrete. Shall we continue the restoration or are such fortifications sufficient?"
whiteruthenia.34.a:0 "Further improve our defences!"

whiteruthenia.35.t:0 "Ostwall Renovations Completed"
whiteruthenia.35.d:0 "Today restoration works on the border defences with Russia were completed, ending a long and expensive programme. A bottle of prize Ruthenian vodka was smashed against the side of the final bunker by one of our generals to much amusement. With such protection in place, our independence is secured."
whiteruthenia.35.a:0 "Excellent!"




whiteruthenia.37.t:0 "Unban the Socialists?"
whiteruthenia.37.d:0 "Along with last year's liberalization and the appointment of some politicians from among the Hramada to ministerial positions, the question of elections and the participation of other political parties in them that are part of the Hramada remains open. In particular, we are talking about the participation in the elections of the Party of Social Revolutionaries and independent socialists, whose views can be described as radically anti-German and anti-monarchist. The Social Revolutionaries were one of the founding parties of the nation, and its exclusion from politics was controversial - especially since its ban was part of our deal with Germany. Supporters claim that this would demonstrate the goodwill and revival of the Belarusian nation, and many others relented, saying that the syndicalists have little chance of coming to power anyway."
whiteruthenia.37.a:0 "What harm could it do?"
whiteruthenia.37.b:0 "We will not take any chances."

whiteruthenia.38.t:0 "NBP Disbanded"
whiteruthenia.38.d:0 "With the liberalisation of our regime, the co-existence of the Crown and Rada together with uncontrollable NBP service is considered to be a major threat to the country, especially if we consider Žyhimont's ambitions to eventually become the King. Without NBP, his power will be further curtailed, however, that means that he can find new allies."
whiteruthenia.38.a:0 "Will this stop Žyhimont?"

whiteruthenia.39.t:0 "The [GetYear] White Ruthenian Elections"
whiteruthenia.39.d:0 "With our democratic reformation complete, it is time for White Ruthenia to have its first true elections since the dissolution of the People’s Republic. Our nation has come a long way since independence, but this is truly a turning point in our fortunes!"
whiteruthenia.39.a:0 "BNP remains victorious!"
whiteruthenia.39.b:0 "Hramada wins a landslide victory!"
whiteruthenia.39.c:0 "Christian Democrats surprisingly win!"

whiteruthenia.40.t:0 "Dealing with Žyhimont"
whiteruthenia.40.d:0 "Žyhimont has proven an effective head of the White Ruthenian secret police, the NBP, and he has protected the state diligently. Unfortunately, his vocal claims to be the rightful heir to the throne and his festering resentment of his brother Uladzimir has been a constant thorn in the government's side. Given his substantial support among the police, our security forces and even the military, it is likely that he could even pose an existential threat to the current monarch and government. We may need to, at the very least, consider a renegotiation of his position."
whiteruthenia.40.a:0 "Negotiate with Žyhimont."
whiteruthenia.40.b:0 "He is no threat."
whiteruthenia.40.c:0 "We must purge Žyhimont and his supporters!"

whiteruthenia.41.t:0 "Žyhimont Demands A Government Role"
whiteruthenia.41.d:0 "Meeting secretly with a coterie of senior aides and police of all stripes, Žyhimont has proposed a deal that the King might find agreeable. He proposes to drop his claim to the White Ruthenian throne under the condition that he is immediately made the head of government as well as retaining de-facto control over the NBP, his secret police power base."
whiteruthenia.41.a:0 "A good deal."
whiteruthenia.41.b:0 "This is too much!"

whiteruthenia.42.t:0 "Žyhimont Demands The Throne!"
whiteruthenia.42.d:0 "Žyhimont has agreed to enter negotiations but has outrageously demanded that Uladzimir immediately abdicate and surrender the crown to him. While senior officials and palace staff believed that Žyhimont would be frank with his ambitions, none supposed he would so blatantly make a grab for power like this."
whiteruthenia.42.a:0 "There is no choice..."
whiteruthenia.42.b:0 "Demand influence in exchange."
whiteruthenia.42.c:0 "Deny his demand, but offer him more influence."
whiteruthenia.42.e:0 "These demands are ridiculous!"

whiteruthenia.43.t:0 "Žyhimont Refuses The Counter-offer!"
whiteruthenia.43.d:0 "Though our offer to the presumptive upstart was extremely conciliatory and fairly recognises the enormous power and influence he wields and should be entitled to, Žyhimont has unfortunately refused the counter-offer and stuck rigidly to his demands."
whiteruthenia.43.a:0 "Surrender the throne."
whiteruthenia.43.b:0 "Offer the throne but demand influence."
whiteruthenia.43.c:0 "This is completely unacceptable!"

whiteruthenia.44.t:0 "Žyhimont Agrees!"
whiteruthenia.44.d:0 "Surprisingly, Žyhimont has agreed to drop his claims to the White Ruthenian throne in exchange for the position of head of government. Some officials had been under the impression that he would have tried to hold out for more, but thankfully they were proved wrong."
whiteruthenia.44.a:0 "I'm glad he has seen reason."

whiteruthenia.45.t:0 "Negotiations Fall Through"
whiteruthenia.45.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, we have failed to reach an agreement with Žyhimont and while he has not yet resigned from government many suspect that he is only staying in his position to consolidate his control over the secret police. Swift action may need to be taken to prevent disaster."
whiteruthenia.45.a:0 "So what, he is no threat..."
whiteruthenia.45.b:0 "Arrange for his arrest!"

whiteruthenia.46.t:0 "Operation Hummingbird"
whiteruthenia.46.d:0 "Operation Hummingbird has begun, a plan for the swift arrests of many of Žyhimont's supporters suspected to be involved in plans for a potential coup d'etat. While Žyhimont's supporters across various branches of government outnumber Uladzimir's forces the advantage of surprise is on the King's side and cutting the head off the snake may prove decisive..."
whiteruthenia.46.a:0 "The operation is a failure.  Long Live King Žyhimont!"
whiteruthenia.46.b:0 "The operation is successful.  Long Live King Uladzimir!"

whiteruthenia.47.t:0 "Syndicalists Take Power In White Ruthenia!"
whiteruthenia.47.d:0 "The recently deposed King of White Ruthenia Uladzimir foolishly unbanned the syndicalists, allowing them to win a surprise victory in the White Ruthenia elections! Like the fable of the Farmer and the Viper, the despicable Syndicalists have repaid Uladzimir's naive kindness by overthrowing him and exiling him from the country. Many are calling for us to intervene to restore order to White Ruthenia. After all, we cannot tolerate a Red presence in the vital Eastern regions while waging war against their compatriots to the west."
whiteruthenia.47.a:0 "Do not intervene."
whiteruthenia.47.b:0 "White Ruthenia must not fall!"

whiteruthenia.48.t:0 "Belarus Seeks Entry Into The Internationale"
whiteruthenia.48.d:0 "Having overthrown the oppressive German monarchy and consolidated their new state under the banner of Syndicalism, an envoy from Belarus has approached us today asking to join our alliance. A nation hostile to Germany on its vulnerable eastern flank, allied with us, would be a serious boon to our war efforts."
whiteruthenia.48.a:0 "Welcome to club comrades!"
whiteruthenia.48.b:0 "They're too distant to help."
whiteruthenia.48.c:0 "We should conquer this land, not ally"

whiteruthenia.49.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Accepts Us!"
whiteruthenia.49.d:0 "The [FROM.GetName] has accepted our request to join the Internationale, and we now stand together against the German imperialists and capitalist exploiters."
whiteruthenia.49.a:0 "Hurrah!"

whiteruthenia.50.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Rejects Us!"
whiteruthenia.50.d:0 "The [FROM.GetName] has refused our request to join the Internationale! This unfortunate outcome means that we essentially stand alone surrounded by enemies on all sides."
whiteruthenia.50.a:0 "It's their loss!"

whiteruthenia.51.t:0 "Belarus Asks To Join The Intermarium"
whiteruthenia.51.d:0 "With the two new Syndicalist states of Eastern Europe joined together in alliance, Belarus has now also asked to join us. Together we will make up a solid power bloc able to defend the interests of the workers in the East."
whiteruthenia.51.a:0 "Of course!"
whiteruthenia.51.b:0 "It's too much trouble."

whiteruthenia.52.t:0 "Poland Accepts Us!"
whiteruthenia.52.d:0 "The Poles have accepted our request to join their alliance! Together we will pose an almost unassailable threat to the interests of imperialists in Central and Eastern Europe."
whiteruthenia.52.a:0 "Hurrah!"

whiteruthenia.53.t:0 "Poland Rejects Us!"
whiteruthenia.53.d:0 "The Poles have refused our request to enter into an alliance with them!"
whiteruthenia.53.a:0 "It's their loss!"


whiteruthenia.57.t:0 "White Ruthenia Demands Our Land!"
whiteruthenia.57.d:0 "The White Ruthenians, having claimed portions of our territory that they claim contain ethnic Belarusians, are now demanding that we either hand these territories over immediately or prepare for war."
whiteruthenia.57.a:0 "Accept their claims."
whiteruthenia.57.b:0 "War? Are they joking?"
whiteruthenia.58.t:0 "Russia Accepts Our Claims!"
whiteruthenia.58.d:0 "Against all odds the Russians have accepted our claims and handed over the territories to us! The Ruthenian nation now embraces far more of our rightful historic territory!"
whiteruthenia.58.a:0 "Am I dreaming?"
whiteruthenia.59.t:0 "Russia Refuses Our Claims!"
whiteruthenia.59.d:0 "Predictably the Russians have refused our claims and have mocked our threats of war, what shall we do?"
whiteruthenia.59.a:0 "We are in no position to fight Russia."
whiteruthenia.59.b:0 "They underestimate us at their own cost!"
whiteruthenia.63.t:0 "Intervention in the Russian Civil War"
whiteruthenia.63.d:0 "Today while the socialist rebels were distracted fighting Russia, the White Ruthenian government claimed our rightful territory, trying to use the weakness of the socialist regime."
whiteruthenia.63.a:0 "We should occupy it as soon as possible."
whiteruthenia.64.t:0 "White Ruthenia Demands Socialist Territory!"
whiteruthenia.64.d:0 "Using our distraction fighting the reactionary Russian government the White Ruthenians are attempting to seize the territory that they claim is rightfully theirs!"
whiteruthenia.64.a:0 "We cannot do anything now..."
whiteruthenia.64.b:0 "This means war!"
whiteruthenia.65.t:0 "White Ruthenia Occupies Socialist Territory!"
whiteruthenia.65.d:0 "Using the civil war as a distraction, the White Ruthenians have seized Socialist-occupied territory they claim is rightfully theirs!"
whiteruthenia.65.a:0 "We will have revenge!"

whiteruthenia.68.t:0 "White Ruthenian Demands Our Territory!"
whiteruthenia.68.d:0 "Following a rise in nationalism and their increasingly independently-minded foreign policy, the White Ruthenian government has threatened war against us unless we hand Brest-Litvosk and Gomel over to them!"
whiteruthenia.68.a:0 "Fine..."
whiteruthenia.68.b:0 "Never!"
whiteruthenia.69.t:0 "Ukraine Agrees!"
whiteruthenia.69.d:0 "They have seen sense and have returned our rightful territories!"
whiteruthenia.69.a:0 "Come home to the Ruthenian nation!"
whiteruthenia.70.t:0 "They Refuse to return our rightful land!"
whiteruthenia.70.d:0 "Unfortunately they have refused our demands and are prepared to defend themselves, even if it means war."
whiteruthenia.70.a:0 "There's nothing we can do."
whiteruthenia.70.b:0 "So be it! To war!"

whiteruthenia.71.t:0 "White Ruthenia Seeks Support"
whiteruthenia.71.d:0 "The White Ruthenian government, after recently claiming Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to be their rightful territories, have come to us to request our support in pressuring to cede these lands to White Ruthenia. As White Ruthenia is a part of the Reichspakt we have a duty to at least consider their request. How shall we reply?"
whiteruthenia.71.a:0 "Back them up."
whiteruthenia.71.b:0 "Decline their request."
whiteruthenia.72.t:0 "The Reichspakt Demands Territory!"
whiteruthenia.72.d:0 "The White Ruthenians, backed up by their German masters, have demanded that we hand over Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to them! While we could likely fend off the White Ruthenians, the influence of Germany makes this situation far more dire for us."
whiteruthenia.72.a:0 "We have no choice."
whiteruthenia.72.b:0 "Never!"
whiteruthenia.73.t:0 "They Refuse Demands!"
whiteruthenia.73.d:0 "They have refused our demands to transfer Gomel and Brest-Litvosk to White Ruthenia. Our envoy was laughed all the way out of their country, and eyes across Europe are watching events with keen interest."
whiteruthenia.73.a:0 "Let us pull back."
whiteruthenia.73.b:0 "We shall take it by force!"
whiteruthenia.74.t:0 "Germany Refuses To Assist!"
whiteruthenia.74.d:0 "Unfortunately the Germans have refused our request to pressure them into returning our rightful lands!"
whiteruthenia.74.a:0 "Damn!"
whiteruthenia.75.t:0 "White Ruthenia Seeks Support"
whiteruthenia.75.d:0 "The White Ruthenian government, after recently claiming Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to be their rightful territories, have come to us to request our support in pressuring to cede these lands to White Ruthenia. As a junior partner in our alliance we should at least consider helping them out. How shall we reply?"
whiteruthenia.75.a:0 "Russia and White Ruthenia should act as one."
whiteruthenia.75.b:0 "Decline their request."
whiteruthenia.76.t:0 "Russia and White Ruthenia Demand Land!"
whiteruthenia.76.d:0 "The White Ruthenians, backed up by their Russian allies, have demanded that we hand over Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to them! While we could likely fend off the White Ruthenians, the influence of a powerful Russia makes this situation far more dire for us."
whiteruthenia.76.a:0 "We have no choice..."
whiteruthenia.76.b:0 "Never!"

whiteruthenia.77.t:0 "They Refuse Demands!"
whiteruthenia.77.d:0 "They have refused our demands to transfer Gomel and Brest-Litvosk to White Ruthenia."
whiteruthenia.77.a:0 "Let us pull back."
whiteruthenia.77.b:0 "Then we shall take it by force!"
whiteruthenia.78.t:0 "Russia Refuses To Assist!"
whiteruthenia.78.d:0 "Unfortunately the Russians have refused our request to pressure them into returning our rightful lands!"
whiteruthenia.78.a:0 "Damn!"
whiteruthenia.79.t:0 "Urbanising White Ruthenia"
whiteruthenia.79.d:0 "The countryside of White Ruthenia has one of the smallest population densities in Europe, with a large number of cities being populated more by the Jewish minority than our own people. If White Ruthenia is to begin to develop a modern economy and industrialise, it is essential that our farmers are encouraged to settle in the cities. Unfortunately, the cost of promoting this migration as well as the cost of building new housing for the migrating residents could be expensive and take a long time to complete."
whiteruthenia.79.a:0 "We can take our time."
whiteruthenia.79.b:0 "Put some emphasis on this."
whiteruthenia.79.c:0 "Urbanisation must be an absolute priority."
whiteruthenia.80.t:0 "Urbanisation Policy Shows Results"
whiteruthenia.80.d:0 "After many months of encouraging urbanisation and settlement into White Ruthenia's major towns, our efforts are finally beginning to bear fruit. Town centres that had been relatively bereft of life since the Tsarist period are now booming with life and civic institutions are gaining strength. Our industry has already begun to benefit from the influx of new workers."
whiteruthenia.80.a:0 "The process is underway."
whiteruthenia.81.t:0 "Urbanisation Policy Succeeds!"
whiteruthenia.81.d:0 "After years of hard work our efforts in encouraging White Ruthenians to move to the cities have finally paid off, and our economy has massively improved as a result. This will no doubt greatly aid in encouraging foreign investment and alleviating the effects of Black Monday."
whiteruthenia.81.a:0 "Finally!"

whiteruthenia.82.t:0 "Encouraging Industrialisation"
whiteruthenia.82.d:0 "For a long time White Ruthenia has lacked industry, receiving little investment from the Tsarist state prior to the Weltkrieg and treated with benign neglect by the Reichspakt system. To make matters worse much of what Russian industry there was began to fall into disrepair as a result of the Weltkrieg and collapse of the Russian Empire, with German companies taking their place. With Black Monday causing immense damage to said German industries, it is clear that White Ruthenia must begin to stand on its own two feet industrially."
whiteruthenia.82.a:0 "We can afford some more funding."
whiteruthenia.82.b:0 "White Ruthenia must embrace the Industrial Revolution!"
whiteruthenia.82.c:0 "Let's not spend too much."
whiteruthenia.83.t:0 "Mechanised Farming Reform"
whiteruthenia.83.d:0 "With the progress of technology, farming methods have already begun to improve with inventions like tractors allowing us to produce yields far in excess of what was possible previously. Despite these improvements, White Ruthenia remains distinctly backwards and its farming is rather inefficient by modern standards. It is clear that things must be improved if White Ruthenia is to take its place in the world as a modern nation."
whiteruthenia.83.a:0 "There's no need for a huge effort."
whiteruthenia.83.b:0 "Some focus on mechanisation is ideal."
whiteruthenia.83.c:0 "Farming must be completely mechanised!"
whiteruthenia.84.t:0 "Improving Rural Infrastructure"
whiteruthenia.84.d:0 "In many places the roads of the White Ruthenian countryside are extremely outdated and pretty much all of them date back to Tsarist-era Russia. There is minimal paving outside of the capital and most villages are connected only by terrible dirt tracks - an issue that has plagued military planners for years. It is clear that something must be done about this if we are to become a modern nation."
whiteruthenia.84.a:0 "Only limited funding is needed."
whiteruthenia.84.b:0 "Improve some of the worst offenders."
whiteruthenia.84.c:0 "The road network must be completely improved!"

whiteruthenia.85.t:0 "Clearing Pripyat Marshes"
whiteruthenia.85.d:0 "The clearing of portions of the Pripyat marshes is now set to begin. Although the Pripyat marshes are vast and a major attempt to clear them is beyond our abilities even a limited clearance would still benefit our nation in providing new land for agriculture or industry."
whiteruthenia.85.a:0 "Let us begin."
whiteruthenia.86.t:0 "Pripyat Marshes Drained!"
whiteruthenia.86.d:0 "The draining of the marshes has finally come to an end with thousands of square miles of new land having been created for agriculture and industry. Already these areas are coming to be populated by migrants from elsewhere in the country willing to set up farms on the reclaimed marshland. No doubt this will aid our nation in the long run."
whiteruthenia.86.a:0 "Finally!"
whiteruthenia.87.t:0 "The Creation of BelAZ"
whiteruthenia.87.d:0 "We have decided to implement our plans for the creation of BelAZ, a manufacturer capable of building various variants of vehicles and machinery at our direction depending on the needs of the state. While heavily funding the programme would be expensive and politically risky, it could undoubtedly pay off in the long run by boosting peripheral sectors and supply chains and it would greatly aid the White Ruthenian economy."
whiteruthenia.87.a:0 "Invest a bit into BelAZ."
whiteruthenia.87.b:0 "Give BelAZ a lot of funding."
whiteruthenia.87.c:0 "BelAZ shall become one of Eastern Europe's greatest manufacturers!"
whiteruthenia.88.t:0 "The Priorities of BelAZ"
whiteruthenia.88.d:0 "As a state-owned company, BelAZ is under our complete control - and as such it is up to the government to decide what it should concentrate on constructing. What should we have BelAZ focus on?"
whiteruthenia.88.a:0 "Agriculture."
whiteruthenia.88.b:0 "Military vehicles."
whiteruthenia.88.c:0 "Mining."
whiteruthenia.88.e:0 "Construction."
whiteruthenia.89.t:0 "Promoting Literacy"
whiteruthenia.89.d:0 "Despite the efforts of the late King Heinrich, illiteracy is still a major problem in part due to the bickering between proponents of different alphabets for the Belarusian language. While we agree that eliminating illiteracy should be a priority, the question is how much we are willing to invest to this end."
whiteruthenia.89.a:0 "Slow and steady wins the race."
whiteruthenia.89.b:0 "This issue demands much attention."
whiteruthenia.89.c:0 "This must be a major priority!"
whiteruthenia.90.t:0 "Literacy Improves"
whiteruthenia.90.d:0 "Thanks to our effort the literacy rate of White Ruthenia has finally begun to improve, however we are not finished yet."
whiteruthenia.90.a:0 "The end is in sight."

whiteruthenia.91.t:0 "Further Improvements In Literacy!"
whiteruthenia.91.d:0 "Thanks to our efforts illiteracy is no longer a rampant problem in White Ruthenia, and the vast majority of the population is now able to read and write. This is a staggering success considering the agrarian and rural nature of the nation."
whiteruthenia.91.a:0 "Fantastic!"
whiteruthenia.92.t:0 "Ethanol Fuel Research"
whiteruthenia.92.d:0 "To compensate for White Ruthenia's lack of resources needed to benefit our industry, we have decided to begin the mass-production of ethanol fuel. The question is, how much funding should we put into the research for its creation?"
whiteruthenia.92.a:0 "There is no need to waste a huge amount of money."
whiteruthenia.92.b:0 "Give them some funding, it is important."
whiteruthenia.92.c:0 "Fuel is essential for our industry."
whiteruthenia.93.t:0 "Ethanol Fuel Breakthrough"
whiteruthenia.93.d:0 "Thanks to our funding, the research for ethanol fuel has had a breakthrough, allowing limited production of fuel to begin. While research will continue, this is a great day for a fuel-independent White Ruthenia!"
whiteruthenia.93.a:0 "Our industry is fueled at last!"
whiteruthenia.94.t:0 "Ethanol Fuel Complete!"
whiteruthenia.94.d:0 "Though it took a while our research into the production of ethanol fuel is complete! Now we can fuel our industry despite our lack of resources."
whiteruthenia.94.a:0 "Great!"
whiteruthenia.95.t:0 "Defending Our Airspace"
whiteruthenia.95.d:0 "Our project to build anti-air guns in order to protect the skies of White Ruthenia from foreign invaders has begun and some are already being installed at this moment. Despite this, there are some officials that have proposed that we invest more into this project in order to protect our fragile growing industry from conflict."
whiteruthenia.95.a:0 "Some more anti-air guns would be ideal."
whiteruthenia.95.b:0 "White Ruthenia must be well protected from harm!"
whiteruthenia.95.c:0 "The current amount is sufficient."
whiteruthenia.96.t:0 "Russians Acclimatise To Our Rule"
whiteruthenia.96.d:0 "While there was some resistance at first from the Russian population in the lands we took from Russia, they have begun to realise their resistance is futile and accept our rule."
whiteruthenia.96.a:0 "Great!"

whiteruthenia.97.t:0 "Ukrainians Acclimatise To Our Rule"
whiteruthenia.97.d:0 "While there was some resistance at first from the Ukrainian population in the lands we took from Ukraine, they have begun to realise their resistance is futile and accept our rule."
whiteruthenia.97.a:0 "Great!"
whiteruthenia.98.t:0 "Black Monday Overcome!"
whiteruthenia.98.d:0 "After years of economic malaise due to Black Monday the actions of the government have brought an end to the crisis in White Ruthenia and our economy is reaching a level of success we have never seen before. It is truly a new era for our young nation."
whiteruthenia.98.a:0 "Finally!"
whiteruthenia.99.t:0 "Russia Declares War"
whiteruthenia.99.d:0 "With our separation from Germany and embrace of socialism, Russia has suddenly declared war upon us. Though we have our back against the wall, we must face down the great Russian bear or die trying."
whiteruthenia.99.a:0 "Like David against Goliath..."




### Events ###
whiteruthenia.100.t:0 "White Ruthenia asks for increased Self-Governance"
whiteruthenia.100.d:0 "A communiqué from the government of the Ruthenian King Waldemar I von Hohenzollern has requested more autonomy in their economic policy. They justify this both by claiming it will easen the burden of their still growing economy on the recovering German one, and that it will make their own, shaky government appear more legitimate."
whiteruthenia.100.a:0 "Dire times afford sacrifices."
whiteruthenia.100.b:0 "In no way, shape or form shall such a thing occur."

whiteruthenia.102.t:0 "Germany has denied our Request."
whiteruthenia.102.d:0 "The German Government has declined to easen the grip on our economy. In countrary, they seem to be planning to strengthen it."
whiteruthenia.102.a:0 "We will have our independence in time."

whiteruthenia.1000.t:0 "Dark Clouds Over Minsk"
whiteruthenia.1000.d:0 "Dark clouds and unsure winds surround the glorious state of White Ruthenia - a land long shackled along with its people to the will of the Kaiser. Black Monday has sent tremors throughout Mitteleuropa and the wider world, strangling our infantile economy as it tried to limp on and prosper after the horrors of the Weltkrieg. Under King Waldemar, or Uladzimir as our people still call him, we have drifted along behind our new masters with little to show for it other than a monarchy hated by the masses and an economy in complete ruin. \n\nSince before the arrival of the Germans to these lands, Republican agitation had long been on the rise under the harsh boot of the Russians, and now with the German-backed monarchy as unpopular as ever, the lands of the ‘Little Russians’ have once again seen a massive spike in the people’s desire for a say in their government. Now various groups have used the rigors of Black Monday to finally turn the tide against the Monarchy. \n\nHowever, the new government has decided to leave the Reichspakt, and now our General Staff is approaching the ministers in order to know, if White Ruthenia should be rightfully returned to the pact."
whiteruthenia.1000.a:0 "Their decisions were illegal, White Ruthenia shall be restored."
whiteruthenia.1000.b:0 "The people of White Ruthenia have spoken, how can we resist their will?"

whiteruthenia.1001.d:0 "With the Hramada seizing power, the question on everyone’s mind is what will happen next. For over a decade King Uladzimir has sat on his throne - a Hohenzollern in a foreign land, reviled by his own people, sitting in decadence as his new nation rots around him under his inefficient rule and the muzzled Republican government. The nationalists, workers, and peasants all tire of German rule, and many blame the monarchy for these woes. \n\nThis atmosphere of tension and hatred are what fueled the Bolsheviks’ resurgence, and on their wave of discontent did these Socialist ride their ways to victory. Now they are left with a choice - what to do with the Crown and its current holder Uladzimir. \n\nIn a shocking revelation even more earth shattering than their victory, the BRA and their leader Usievalad Ihnatoŭski have offered an olive branch to the Monarchy. Not seeking to tank the economy as the few remaining German business leaders still hold deep grips into our industry and would certainly be outraged over their main benefactor being ousted, and more importantly not wanting to draw the ire of the Kaiser even more by dethroning his own family, Ihnatoŭski has offered a deal. The King would be allowed to keep his throne, serving as the main liaison with foreign powers and most importantly keep the Reichspakt off our backs. Under his rule, the BPSR would tacitly work within the democratic parliament under the Crown, working with the King towards a more unified Belarus. Alternatively, they could simply cast out the King, potentially earning the wrath of the Kaiser, but also be more free to create their Bolshevik utopia. What shall their final decision be?"

Still, despite this pushback, a relative atmosphere of peace has been established thanks to the brave efforts of the Royal Belarusian People’s Guard.\n\nNewly formed from the ashes of the old police forces, national guards, royal guards, BPSR militias, and other various militant arms of the government, ths RBPG is the premier secret police force of the new Belarus nation. As their seemingly endless numbers patrol the streets of Minsk and the palace grounds, all watch in awe and muted fear, for ending up on their lists means a fate worse than death. Citizens taken by their ranks are never seen or heard from again, and the records of their existence are erased from history. Entire family lines have been erased in this way, wiped from the pages of history for daring to speak out against the People’s Crown. \n\nThis atmosphere of terror reaches across the new Belarus from the densest cities to the more isolated farming communities, for no place in this nation is safe from their wrath. They strike without sound and leave no trace, but all know of their existence, and all those that are wise enough obey - those that don’t are never seen again."

whiteruthenia.1005.d:0 "Against all odds, the people of White Ruthenia have voted to abolish the monarchy and restore the long-dead Republic. This comes most shockingly to Prince Žyhimont, brother of the King, who had ensured his brother at every possible turn that the Kingdom would survive. The prince himself, never one to shy away from direct action, has come to his brother with a plan to ensure our very survival. In brief, Žyhimont explained how a Republic would do nothing but bring ruin both within Belarus, but within the great Germanic sphere which White Ruthenia finds itself in the middle of. To solve this, all Uladzimir would have to do would be to declare the referendum invalid and dissolve the already powerless Rada, and he could save his Kingdom. While such a move would obviously be unpopular, Žyhimont has assured Uladzimir that the NBP stands ready against any insurrection. Seemingly completely certain that his brother will follow his lead, Žyhimont has already prepared the nessary paperwork for the king, all that remains is for his signature..."

All throughout White Ruthenia, unorganized masses of peasants, workers, and even members of the middle class, have risen up against our continue rule. Just as Žyhimont promised, his NBP has been able to easily crush the vast majority of these revolts, with one crucial exception. The uprising within our capital of Minsk, unlike most other revolts, seemingly has a massive amount of organizational support.  Be it the way a general strike was declared hours before the uprising proper, or the arrival of BPSR partisans, the Minsk uprising clearly has backing towards it. As of now, the fighting is still ongoing, and control over the city is still hotly contested. If the city does indeed fall, it would mean that the nation itself would have fallen, due to the centralized nature of our state. As for King Uladzimir, in an attempt to save himself, has secured himself and his family with in the city, at an unknown location. What's more, in the midst of the fighting, Žyhimont is said to be commanding the loyalist forces from a fortified compound outside the city, potentially meaning that a counterattack could take place if the city does fall..."

However, that does not mean the end of hostilities, far from it. Almost immediately following the fall of the city, the Socialist and Republican united front fell apart, as the two sides dived the city between themselves, and tensions grew. In this powder-keg like atmosphere, it was inevitable that the two sides would break into hostilities. As both sides began firing and fighting among themselves, Prince Žyhimont launched a counterattack from his position outside the city. As fighting rears up between three factions in a battle for the very soul of the nation, it is clear that..."

Despite this restoration of White Ruthenia's proper order, one key man is still missing, that man of course being the King himself. In the midst of the fighting, Uladzimir and his wife fled to a secure compound within the city, one so secure and hidden that only two men, the King and his brother, and the small staff that maintains it, even know about it. In order to further the security of the compound, a strict policy of radio silence is observed by the staff, to further reinforce it's security. With his brother still at the compound, Žyhimont has effectively taken command of the nation in his place, a position he has long coveted. With the situation being what it is, Žyhimont could very easily capitalize on it, sizing his rightful place, and all it would cost would be the death of his brother. While obviously this is a risky move, and very well could cost Žyhimont his own life, perhaps the cost would be worth it, so that the nation could finally truly be free."

WHR_national_army_desc:0 "The White Ruthenian National Army, formed by Konstantin Ezovitov at the end of the Weltkrieg has gradually fallen victim to reductions in size as a result of economic problems and a reliance on Germany. If White Ruthenia is to stand on its own two feet as a country it must have a strong and independent military ready to defend the nation."

WHR_munitions:0 "Ruthenian Munitions"
WHR_munitions_desc:0 "At the current time White Ruthenia lacks a major domestic arms industry, relying on others for guns and ammunition. If our military is to prosper we must begin to research the manufacture of weapons so that our nation will not need to rely on foreign arms."

WHR_officer_school_desc:0 "Currently our nation lacks an officer school, limiting the quality and training of our officers.

WHR_exempt_scientists:0 "Exempt Scientists from Conscription"

WHR_defend_ruthenia_desc:0 "While Europe has enjoyed a decade and a half of peace following the end of the Weltkrieg it is clear world tensions are growing and that it is only a matter of time until Europe is embroiled in war once more.

WHR_home_defence:0 "Form the Ruthenian Home Defence"
WHR_home_defence_desc:0 "If White Ruthenia is to be militarily effective in the face of a war we must focus on the homefront.

WHR_equipment_production:0 "Maximize Equipment Production"

WHR_cavalry_speed_desc:0 "Our nation lacks manpower and cannot afford to be bogged down in a repeat of the Weltkrieg. If White Ruthenia is to be a victorious nation in any future conflict, the emphasis of its army must be on speed and a quick victory to any wars in which it is embroiled."

WHR_ostwall_desc:0 "Despite their crippling defeat in the Weltkrieg, it is clear that Russian power is on the rise again. With many in our country harbouring pro-Russian sentiments there is a strong possibility that should Russia begin to turn it's attention to Europe we will be first on their list of revanchist targets. To forestall this we need to restore our dilapidated border defences quickly."

WHR_air_force_desc:0 "Despite the many air bases already built in our country with the help of the Germans we have very few planes in our air force as a result of their cost being deemed too much for our poor economy. If we are to defend our country from the air this must begin to change."
WHR_fighters:0 "Procure Fighter Designs"

WHR_aviation_fuel:0 "Direct Injection Fuel Systems"
WHR_aviation_fuel_desc:0 "The concept of a direct injection fuel system has been around since its invention by the Swedish engineer Jonas Hesselman. By implementing direct injection fuel systems into our planes we could help prevent stalling durig the process of high speed aerial manoeuvres."

### Focuses ###

### Initial Uladzimir Focuses ###
 WHR_Waldemar:0 "Uladzimir on the Throne"
 WHR_Waldemar_desc:0 "While the political system of White Ruthenia is constitutionally nearly identical to the German system, the current King Uladzimir prefers to leave the day-to-day governing to the current head of government. Vasil Zacharka. Appointed by his father seemingly to spite the social democrat domanined Rada, Zacharka essentially has free reign of the country. If we truly wish to get out of this dark age, this state of affairs simply will not do."
 WHR_democracy:0 "Reforms In The Kingdom"
 WHR_democracy_desc:0 "It is clear that on account of his illness and disinterest in day-to-day rule Uladzimir is perhaps unfit to rule as an absolutist King. However, instead of giving into Žyhimont's demands, the answer clearly lies in reforming the nation into a fully constitutional monarchy and fully restoring the democracy of the original Belarusian republic."
 WHR_unban_left:0 "The Hramada Question"
 WHR_unban_left_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to step towards returning to democracy, we must decide if the Syndicalist parties should remain banned or not. While weak and lacking support, they could still constitute a significant threat if allowed to proliferate legally and stand in elections."
 WHR_liberalise_press:0 "Liberalise the Press"
 WHR_liberalise_press_desc:0 "In the past our press was carefully examined and anything criticising our regime or the German Empire censored. It is time to reform this so that newspapers and people of all opinions and politics may have a say."
 WHR_disband_secret:0 "Disband the NBP"
 WHR_disband_secret_desc:0 "While Uladzimir's popularity has begun to increase among the people following our reforms, Žyhimont and his supporters in the NBP secret police remain a major threat to the new government. It is time to disband the secret police and arrest Žyhimont himself if it comes to that."

 WHR_elections:0 "Call New Elections"
 WHR_elections_desc:0 "Now that all threats to our new democracy have been eliminated, it is time for White Ruthenia to finally hold its first ever truly free elections since the fall of the People’s Republic."

 WHR_authoritarian:0 "Flex Royal Prerogatives"
 WHR_authoritarian_desc:0 "To say that White Ruthenia is in crisis would be an understatement, and while many claim this is due to the lack of bending to the people’s will, others claim it comes from a lack of use of the Royal Prerogative granted by our Prussian-style constitution to King Uladzimir. If Uladzimir truly wishes to see the nation reborn, he must flex his muscles so to speak, perhaps finally shutting up the Rada for good. "
 WHR_special_courts:0 "Establish Special Courts"
 WHR_special_courts_desc:0 "In spite of our best efforts syndicalists, pro-Russians and other enemies of the state still run rampant. It is clear that the NBP need to increase their operations, starting with secret trials of those whose opinions we deem unacceptable."
 WHR_censor_press:0 "Extend Press Censorship"
 WHR_censor_press_desc:0 "Even with our current censorship, our enemies have still been able to secretly spread their ideals in many of the popular newspapers. We must begin to strictly dictate what content newspapers are to publish and ban those who refuse to conform."
 WHR_sigismund_negotiations:0 "The Position of Žyhimont"
 WHR_sigismund_negotiations_desc:0 "Despite Uladzimir's recent show of strength his resentful brother Žyhimont still claims himself the rightful king of White Ruthenia, and is amassing a number of supporters throughout all branches of government. This problem must be dealt with one way or another as soon as possible, as every more minute wasted gives Žyhimont more time to plot."

### BNP Monarchy Focuses ###
 WHR_BNP:0 "The BNP Remain"
 WHR_BNP_desc:0 "The BNP is a right-wing party formed from those who chose to stay loyal to Germany following the dissolving of the Belarusian People's Republic and the ascension of Genrykh I to the throne of White Ruthenia. Although lacking power while Genrykh was on the throne, their power greatly increased during Uladzimir's reign allowing them to maintain themselves as a major political force."
 WHR_Belorutenization:0 "'Weißruthenisation'"
 WHR_Belorutenization_desc:0 "To alleviate the poor national cohesion our subjects have we shall forge a new identity for them. Inspired by various Prussian models, the programme of 'White-Ruthenization' shall transform the clueless people into proud guardians of their own country and destiny. Independent from any notions of being just lost Russians."
 WHR_White_Ruthenia_New_Loyal:0 "White Ruthenia Loyal and New"
 WHR_White_Ruthenia_New_Loyal_desc:0 "White Ruthenia is finally a land people are happy to call their home. A strong, disciplined nation devoted to their benevolent monarch. No longer shall the idea of 'Belarus' poison the minds of our countrymen. We are White Ruthenian and we are our King's best men."

### Christian Democrats Focuses ###
 WHR_BKhd:0 "Christian Democracy"
 WHR_BKhd_desc:0 "Belarusian Christian Democracy, or BKhD, is a traditional conservative party led by Adam Stankievič. Thanks to his background as a catholic priest, the party is very popular in more devout communities, especially in the west of Belarus. BKhD's main aim is the protection of the peasant and creation of a morally just nation in cooperation with all the Churches, be they Catholic, Greek Rite or Orthodox."
 WHR_Revive_Land_Reform:0 "Draft a New Land Reform"
 WHR_Revive_Land_Reform_desc:0 "A central pillar of the Belarusian society is the humble farme who makes up most of our workforce. From small peasants to landed gentry we must support this foundation of our society by drafting a new land reform plan."
 WHR_Khutor_System:0 "Praise the Khutar System"
 WHR_Khutor_System_desc:0 "Khutars are a single-homestead rural units. While some might think such settlements might pale in comparison to agrarian collectives, we know that a proud farmer working for his own independent home is far more industrious than in any other system. We should encourage continued development inside the Khutar System."
 WHR_Church_Education_2:0 "Bring the Churches in Education"
 WHR_Church_Education_2_desc:0 "Ever since Medieval times, the Church has pioneered education and enlightenment of the masses. Thanks to their effort, many scientific breakthroughs have been made. If we are to ensure Belarus is at the forefront of progress the Churches have to contribute towards the educational system."
 WHR_Modeling_Identity:0 "Modeling Belarusian Identity"
 WHR_Modeling_Identity_desc:0 "Thanks to the weakness of our identity Belarus has been dragged around by foreign powers since centuries. Our poor and pious people don't deserve such fate. That is why we must look towards the deep and rich folk culture and form a new national identity respecting our long-lived traditions."
 WHR_BIKK:0 "Institute of Economy and Culture"
 WHR_BIKK_desc:0 "With the creation of the Institute of Economy and Culture, Belarus shall have a place of education others in Eastern Europe will look with envy towards. Our people will receive the best in terms of training and lecturing, all in an effort of creating a better future for our nation."
 WHR_Belarus_Moral_Fair:0 "Belarus Moral and Fair"
 WHR_Belarus_Moral_Fair_desc:0 "We have succeeded in our efforts to transform Belarus into a moral, pious and humble society of highly skilled peasants. The people of our great land respect what the earth provides them, same as they respect one another in a christian brotherly way. May the Blessed Virgin, the Most Holy Mother of God keep our nation safe and prosperous for eternity."

### BPS-F Focuses ###

 WHR_BPSF:0 "New Democratic Coalition"
 WHR_BPSF_desc:0 "Having managed to secure a majority inside the Hramada, the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists has formed a truly democratic government of like-minded parties. While still interested in many aspects the more leftists Hramada representatives focus on, BPS-F aims to transform Belarus into a free and democratic society. One that will be fair to all the people of our nation, not any particular group or class."
 WHR_Belarus_Sovereignity:0 "Belarus Sovereignity"
 WHR_Belarus_Sovereignity_desc:0 "Belarus is finally free, after so many years of being shackled by the German behemoth. With our independence secured the time has finally come to start shaping our nation into a state which will satisfy every citizen. No longer will we let ourselves be exploited, we shall prosper on our own!"
 WHR_National_Revival:0 "National Revival"
 WHR_National_Revival_desc:0 "We have to come to terms with the sad fact that Belarusian identity as a thing doesn't exactly exist. It's one of the reasons why foreign powers had such an easy time subjugating us over the years. This has to change if we are to maintain a stable republic. We shall draw from great writers and artists of old to create a modern and proud identity, one that we could call our own."
 WHR_Principles_Of_Federalism:0 "Principles of Federalism"
 WHR_Principles_Of_Federalism_desc:0 "Belarus is a land of diverse peoples and cultures. To lump them all under one commanding authority would mean that unfair treatment might easily arise. Instead, we will institute a leveled system of administration with more autonomy given to various groups and states. With lesser government oversight these regions will be able to more effectively manage their own affairs and protect the rich cultural heritage of Belarusian nations."
 WHR_Rural_Education:0 "Rural Education"
 WHR_Rural_Education_desc:0 "The state of education outside the biggest cities is truly sorry. The average Belarusian peasant is sadly stuck deeply in the 16th century. We need to change that by funding a wide-reaching program of rural education and creation of village schools."
 WHR_Solve_The_Agrarian_Question:0 "Solve the Agrarian Question"
 WHR_Solve_The_Agrarian_Question_desc:0 "The Agrarian Question has been the bane of ordinary people of Belarus as far as anyone can remember. We cannot delay finding the solution for it any longer. A grand and ambitious plan shall be formulated to finally fix the broken state of our fair lands."
 WHR_Strengthen_The_Rada:0 "Strengthen the Rada"
 WHR_Strengthen_The_Rada_desc:0 "The Rada is the greatest institution for our great people. Filled with representatives elected by the general population, it provides a truly fair system of representation. Thus, it is only logical that the powers of the Rada should be expanded so we more effectively serve the people's will."
 WHR_Self_Reliance:0 "Self-Reliance Tactics"
 WHR_Self_Reliance_desc:0 "Taught by experiences of previous foreign oppression, we know that our economy cannot rely on outside forces to be propped up. We need to introduce various mechanics and systems into our industrial sphere to transform it into a softly autarkic state, one benefiting our people first and foremost."
 WHR_Cooperative_Economy:0 "Cooperative Economy"
 WHR_Cooperative_Economy_desc:0 "A nation needs an economy that works for all and not the few at the top. That is why we will form our new economy around the concept of cooperatives. With everybody working in tandem with each other and profiting equally from their labor they will be further motivated to even greater heights of prosperity. Hand in hand we shall make the Belarusian economy the greatest in the world!"
 WHR_Oppose_Hramada:0 "Oppose Hramada"
 WHR_Oppose_Hramada_desc:0 "Unfortunately for us and our great people, the socialist Hramada has turned out to be nothing more than a bunch of blinded radicals. Despite so many successful changes introduced by our government, they have gone into total opposition towards us, calling us petty bourgeoisie. We have to deal with them if we are to continue our great mission."
 WHR_Calm_The_Left_2:0 "Calm the Left"
 WHR_Calm_The_Left_2_desc:0 "While the more socialist members of the Hramada have started to feel uneasy with how moderate our reforms might seem, they need not worry. Our main aim is to ensure that Belarus' society is fair and equal for every single one of its members. In that, we align with the Left of Hramada and shall continue the fruitful cooperation with them."
 WHR_Nationalization:0 "Reasonable Nationalization"
 WHR_Nationalization_desc:0 "Our next endeavor in reforming Belarus into a modern nation is to begin the process of nationalizing important areas of industry. While full nationalization would only bring ruin to our nation, these areas require the stability given by government control. Naturally, most of the previous owners will be compensated if they agree to our proposal."
 WHR_Nurture_Middle_Class:0 "Nurturing the Middle Class"
 WHR_Nurture_Middle_Class_desc:0 "The middle class in Belarus is rapidly rising thanks to our recent reforms. In order to ensure that they continue their support for our beautiful nation we need to actively help them. In time, they shall form the intellectual and industrial backbone of our society."
 WHR_Belarus_Free_True:0 "Belarus Free and True"
 WHR_Belarus_Free_True_desc:0 "We have managed to finally create a free and fair Belarus. One in which rights of all people are respected, where the economy works for the benefit of the many and not the few and where a proud democratic culture is fostered.

 WHR_syndicalism:0 "Socialize the Land"
 WHR_syndicalism_desc:0 "The core of our reforms is the system of Land Socialization. Though our detractors say it is merely Nationalization, that is when land belongs to the state. However, when it belongs to people, it is a far more noble and fair institution - Socialization. Private ownership of Belarus' land shall be a thing of the past, for this vast, bountiful, and beautiful expanse that we call home shall now be collectively and equally owned by the expansive Belarusian proletariat."
 WHR_bolshevik:0 "Embrace Bolshevism"
 WHR_bolshevik_desc:0 "Despite the success of the syndicalist revolutions in the west, Bolshevism remains the true revolutionary ideology of eastern nations. We must embrace our roots, a belief which was cruelly crushed by the combined reactionary forces of Germany and White Russia."
 WHR_land_confiscation:0 "Land Confiscations"
 WHR_land_confiscation_desc:0 "The peasantry of Belarus have for a long time been under the thumb of the rich kulaks and the landlords. Many of these landlords are not even Belarusians at all but in fact are of Polish descent. The peasantry of Belarus must take back their land from these robbers of the people so that we can begin to establish agricultural collectives."
 WHR_central_planning:0 "Central Planning"
 WHR_central_planning_desc:0 "While some diehard syndicalists might accuse of being merely state capitalists, an economy dictated not by syndicates or free market but by the needs of the government is the most efficient system, as even the newfound Totalist movement admits."
 WHR_recreate_police:0 "Recreate the Secret Police"
 WHR_recreate_police_desc:0 "While we revile the despicable NBP they certainly did their job in repressing dissent towards the regime. It would be both greatly beneficial and ironic for us to create a secret police of our own, this time in service of the worker and not of the capitalist exploiters."
 WHR_empower_unions:0 "Empower the Trade Unions"
 WHR_empower_unions_desc:0 "The rights of the workers and trade unions were often ruthlessly repressed by the former regime. Now that we are in power, it is time to adapt the nation to a new Syndicalist system."
 WHR_industrial_cooperatives:0 "Create Industrial Cooperatives"
 WHR_industrial_cooperatives_desc:0 "As a result of long neglect from both Russia and our former German masters Belarus contains a significant lack of industry. We must begin to create industrial cooperatives so as to begin turning our country into a modern Syndicalist nation."
 WHR_arm_people:0 "Arm the People"
 WHR_arm_people_desc:0 "The Germans feared the might of the proletariat and so their puppets forbade the Belarusian peasantry from owning significant weaponry. Now that they are gone everyone must learn from a young age how to fight and the necessity of defending their freedom against capitalist exploitation."

 WHR_land_committes:0 "Land Committes"
 WHR_land_committes_desc:0 "Right now the land in the regions where it was socialized remains in a strange state of limbo without any concrete oversight. That is exactly why we need to create local Land Committes to manage the shared land and ensure that the villages work together as one cohesive unit."
 WHR_ties_to_russian_srs:0 "Ties to Russian SRs"
 WHR_ties_to_russian_srs_desc:0 "Our humble party of Socialist-Revolutionaries comes from the same origins as the great champions of the people in Russia. Having transformed Belarus into a socialist paradise fit to stand on equal footing with our brotherly proletariat, we should reach out to the PLSR government in hopes of future cooperation."

 WHR_Demand_Rada_Dissolution_desc:0 ""
 WHR_Transition_To_Soviet_Democracy:0 "Transition to Soviet Democracy"
 WHR_Transition_To_Soviet_Democracy_desc:0 "We have to transform our government into a truly Soviet Democracy. Instead of the state being tyrannical like in Mitteleuropa or the Entente,relying on reactionary elements of society to pull our strings like in many capitalist ‘democracies’. We have to achieve a Peoples State, one in which the people vote in elections to choose delegates who directly execute their will."
 WHR_Light_Industrialization:0 "Light Industrialisation"
 WHR_Light_Industrialization_desc:0 "Belarus cannot be satisfied with keeping the same agrarian structure forever! On the contrary, it must work on modernizing itself. Therefore, we have to start a moderate industrialization process in order to get the best results for the country and the people."

 WHR_Sieradas_Report_desc:0 "Jan Sierada, People's Minister for Agriculture, is to submit his report on the state of land reform within the nation to  the Rada. It is well-known that the program never got anywhere, and it is hoped that the report will clear up any confusion and offer a way for the government to tackle the issue again."

 WHR_MaAV_Opening_desc:0 "Built with German help initially as an auto repair workshop, the Mahilou (Mogilev) Automobile Plant is to open to great acclaim. Along with repair facilities for the army, especially for German forces in the region, the expanded Plant includes the tools and machinery to begin production of agricultural tractors, making it the cornerstone of the BSDP's industrialisation program and a symbol of German-Belarusian cooperation."
 WHR_The_Assembly:0 "Congress of the Hramada"
 WHR_The_Assembly_desc:0 "Belarus' ruling coalition since the fall of the monarchy a short time ago, the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union, or Hramada, is lead by the BDSP. However, the stalling of Plan Sierada and the collapse of the German economy has shaken its unity. An emergency congress of the Hramada has been called to tackle these issues and either reel the other parties back in, or propose a new plan to the Rada."
 WHR_Status_Quo:0 "Begin Plan Sierada"
 WHR_Status_Quo_desc:0 "With the Hramada rallied back behind the moderates of the BSDP, Plan Sierada can begin with the support of the entire coalition. This will also then allow us to proceed with our other ambitious projects, from industrial expansion to education reform."
 WHR_Protect_Parliament:0 "Protecting the Rada's Authority"
 WHR_Protect_Parliament_desc:0 "The Rada is the true representative of the people. This very fact is enshrined in the constitution as the legislature represents the people's sovereignty. The threats to our young parliamentary republic have eased, further cementing our young democracy against reactionaries and autocrats."
 WHR_Solidify_identity:0 "Solidifying our Identity"
 WHR_Solidify_identity_desc:0 "Lack of a common national identity is one of the worst characteristics a nation may have. We’ve been doing many things to correct this injustice in the past 20 years. Yet there’s still much work to be done. We must continue on."
 WHR_Bundist_Ties:0 "Leash the Bund"
 WHR_Bundist_Ties_desc:0 "The Bund is growing more and more worried with our programs and may cut ties with us, we must not let that happen, we must contact the moderates, the most pro-BSDP members of the Bund, to ensure the continuation of our alliance with the Bund."
 WHR_Bund_Autonomy:0 "Negotiations with the Bund?"
 WHR_Bund_Autonomy_desc:0 "Starting chaos with our allies will achieve nothing productive, we should negotiate with the Bund leadership to hash out a deal to reinvigorate our alliance."
 WHR_Minority_Protection:0 "Protect Minorities"
 WHR_Minority_Protection_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to bring about an equal society, the reality has been less than ideal, as even with constitutional guarantees, there remains tension between that nation's ethnic groups. We must not only have codified guarantees, but our actions must match the formalities and renew our dedication to the Personal Principle."
 WHR_Civic_Nationalism:0 "Promote Civic Nationalism"
 WHR_Civic_Nationalism_desc:0 "The formation of the Belarusian nation was not only an effort of the Belarusian people. Many minorities lent their effort to the nation building we’ve been so desperately craving for years. Therefore, we should focus on promoting a specific type of Nationalism. One that takes loyalty, freedom and equality from its citizens. Civic Nationalism."
 WHR_National_Awakening:0 "The National Awakening"
 WHR_National_Awakening_desc:0 "Our efforts bear fruit! Nowadays more people proudly identify as “Belarusian” than have at any point in history. Soon, the Belarusian nation will be recognised as a true one, equal to the Poles and Russians that once looked down on us as mere peasants and fodder for assimilation."
 WHR_Guaranteed_Liberties:0 "Guaranteed Liberties"
 WHR_Guaranteed_Liberties_desc:0 "With many threats around the world ramping up their ante, it’s quite sad to see our citizens despair about potentially losing their rights.

 WHR_Expand_Rural_Education_desc:0 "Lack of education for the Peasantry has always been an incredibly potent issue for our fledgling nation. We’ve been taking steps to rectify this for years now and we shall keep doing so in the future, for education is the backbone of any modern country."

 WHR_Expand_Pedagogical_Institute_desc:0 "Founded as the Minsk Teachers' Training Institute in 1914, the Pedagogical Institute has proven to be one of the central pillars for Belarusian nation-building, training teachers to educate the people, young and old. In order to keep up with the massive expansion of our national education system, the Institute must be expanded to help fill the ever-increasing number of classrooms and continue the fight against illiteracy."
 WHR_Build_University:0 "Belarusian State University"
 WHR_Build_University_desc:0 "Founded in October of 1921, BSU is the foremost higher education institution in Belarus. As mentioned previously, education is the backbone of any fledging, so we’ll make sure to keep the University well-funded. The next generations are key towards Belarus’ success."
 WHR_Calm_The_Left:0 "Calming the Left"
 WHR_Calm_The_Left_desc:0 "At the start of this crisis, we rebuked the Left-wing of our party and kept going with our reformist ideals. Regardless however, we should reassure our comrades from the left. We’re all fighting for the same thing here: a Socialist Belarus, equal for all."

 WHR_BSDP_Black_Monday:0 "Dealing with Black Monday"
 WHR_BSDP_Black_Monday_desc:0 "As we are dependent on the German economy, it came to no shock that the aftershocks of Black Monday quickly reached our nation as several German firms had to close shop, leaving many Belarusians unemployed. Now that we have dealt with the land reform issue, which affects a much greater portion of our population, we can tackle this new challenge. For now, public works projects will keep our people busy as we assess the damage."
 WHR_Help_Jewish_Organizations:0 "Help Jewish Organisations"
 WHR_Help_Jewish_Organizations_desc:0 "Many urban-based Jewish organisations have been hit particularly hard by Black Monday. The Rada should divert some funds to said associations for quicker recovery. Our Bundist allies will surely appreciate that."
 WHR_Nationalize_Key_Industries:0 "Nationalise Key Industries"
 WHR_Nationalize_Key_Industries_desc:0 "The BSDP has always supported the nationalisation of some key sectors of the economy. With German firms bankrupt or pulling out, we have a good opportunity to pick up after their mess and strengthen our nation's economic position within our own country."

 WHR_Waiting_on_the_Germans_desc:0 "In spite of us taking the most appropriate measures to combat the economic crisis, we should be honest with ourselves. Belarus’ economy is notably weak, especially when compared to our neighbours.

### Coup ###
 WHR_Aftermath_Of_The_Coup:0 "Aftermath of the Coup"
 WHR_Aftermath_Of_The_Coup_desc:0 "The Army has stepped in just in time to save the country from the crypto-syndicalists of the BSDP. While the dust has barely settled in Minsk, the socialists have taken up arms to continue the fight in the countryside. To secure the nation from them and ensure that we remain free from Syndicalism, we must take a stand, for the future of the nation."
 WHR_The_New_Populist_Government:0 "The New Populist Government"
 WHR_The_New_Populist_Government_desc:0 "Formerly the opposition to the BSDP government within the powerless Rada,, the Christian Democrats and Populists of the National Democratic Association have pledged their support for the military government. Seeing the true threat the socialists pose, a unity government has been formed consisting of National Democratic representatives in the Rada and the army."
 WHR_Stop_Land_Reform:0 "Stop the Land Reform"
 WHR_Stop_Land_Reform_desc:0 "The socialists' destabilising ideological program has gone far enough. The worst excesses have long been dealt with and its continuation only serves to hurt the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, and the loyal landowners of the country."
 WHR_Restore_The_Rada:0 "Restructure the Rada"
 WHR_Restore_The_Rada_desc:0 "It is imperative that some form of representation is maintained in our republic, for we cannot ignore the plights of our people. The seats held by the BSDP have been, of course, forfeited, and those held by Lastouski's Kryvians are loyal to our anti-syndicalist cause, leaving us with a comfortable majority to legally enact laws and constitutional changes."
 WHR_Church_Education:0 "Bring the Churches in Education"
 WHR_Church_Education_desc:0 "The BSDP's insistence on purely secular education has proved to be a major roadblock for the struggling situation of our institutions. The Catholic and Orthodox churches are keen to help improve literacy among the poor peasants, the majority of the nation's population, and instil good values in them. We will solve the literacy issue much more easily and quickly by letting them organise schools again."
 WHR_Promote_Civic_Nationalism:0 "Promote Civic Nationalism"
 WHR_Promote_Civic_Nationalism_desc:0 "It is imperative that we do not betray the ideals of civic nationalism, for many minorities live in White Ruthenia. While continuing to improve the national awakening of the Belarusians, we cannot abandon our Polish and Russian allies in the face of the existential threat of Syndicalism."
 WHR_Formally_Ban_BSDP:0 "Ban the BSDP"
 WHR_Formally_Ban_BSDP_desc:0 "It is not enough to merely oppose the BSDP; we must ensure that they can never threat our nation ever again. As such, their party will be formally banned along with their leftist allies in the Hramada. We cannot allow crypto-syndicalists to enter our government ever again."
 WHR_National_Revolution:0 "The National Revolution"
 WHR_National_Revolution_desc:0 "It is clear that to avoid a godless Syndicalist revolution, a National one must take place to lead the nation away from leftist agitation. This is what our government represents, and we will lead the Belarusian nation towards a future free of foreign agitators."
 WHR_Puppet_Rada:0 "The New Rada"
 WHR_Puppet_Rada_desc:0 "When the Republic was refounded, a strict parliamentary system was put in place. However, with a Syndicalist takeover only barely averted thanks to the swift actions of the military and Rada opposition, it is clear that such a system has failed our people. A more balanced system is required, one where the legislature does not hold complete control over the executive."
 WHR_Power_To_The_President:0 "Empower the Presidency"
 WHR_Power_To_The_President_desc:0 "As part of our reforms to ensure a Syndicalist takeover can never happen, we must strengthen the Rada and the President. This will formally transform White Ruthenia into a presidential system instead of a parliamentary one."
 WHR_Military_Representation:0 "Military Representatives"
 WHR_Military_Representation_desc:0 "The military has proven to be our nation's saviour, so it is only natural that they would be guaranteed representation in our government and the Rada. This way, there will be a more direct connection between civilian and military and will allow the latter to intervene against any Syndicalist plots in a more timely (and legal) manner in the future."
 WHR_Reichspakt_Cooperation:0 "Deepen Cooperation with the Reichspakt"
 WHR_Reichspakt_Cooperation_desc:0 "The Reichspakt is the world's last barrier against the Third Internationale and their plot for global revolution. It is imperative that we deepen our ties with Germany to help them defeat Europe's greatest threat."
 WHR_Increase_Role_In_Mitteleuropa:0 "Increasing our Role in Mitteleuropa"
 WHR_Increase_Role_In_Mitteleuropa_desc:0 "Germany cannot defend Europe from Syndicalism and Russian imperialism alone, and we have been a minor part of the Reichspakt for far too long. It is time that we increase our contributions to Mitteleuropa's common defence, especially with the rising Russian threat."
 WHR_Belarus_Pure_And_True:0 "Belarus Pure and True"
 WHR_Belarus_Pure_And_True_desc:0 "It is not enough that Belarusians have an independent nation. The nation must also protect its values and morals against godlessness and radicalism. White Ruthenia is now back on a path where it will become an example for the rest of Europe despite our size and power."

 WHR_The_Countercoup:0 "The Countercoup"
 WHR_The_Countercoup_desc:0 "While the military has stepped in to save our nation from ruin, the democrats in the Rada have proven to be indecisive against the Syndicalist threat. Vaclau Lastouski, leader of the Kryvian movement, has stepped in to lead the nation in its time of need. Once the crypto-syndicalist and liberal traitors are out of the way, we will begin White Ruthenia's national rejuvenation. "
 WHR_Proclaim_Kryvia:0 "Proclaim the Kryvian State"
 WHR_Proclaim_Kryvia_desc:0 "Terms such as White Ruthenia and Belarus are all foreign terms forced on our people. Only Kryvia truly represents our people in its once-pure form, before it was crushed under foreign occupations. With the proclamation of the Kryvian State, we are formally announcing the rebirth of our nation as a free, independent, and pure one."
 WHR_Purge_The_Rada:0 "Purge the Rada"
 WHR_Purge_The_Rada_desc:0 "The Rada is filled with leftist degenerates, foreign nationals, and corrupt capitalists. They must be purged and replaced by true servants of the people and nation, all the while making sure that corruption and degeneration can never again seep into the halls of power."
 WHR_Control_The_State:0 "Controlling the State"
 WHR_Control_The_State_desc:0 "There are too many barriers set against our movement. If we are to see the rebirth of our nation, we must take these down and take full control of the state and its institutions to reshape it. With power concentrated in the hands of Vaclau Lastouski, we will be able to see the consolidation of the Kryvian state become reality."
 WHR_The_Kryvian_Concept:0 "The Kryvian Concept"
 WHR_The_Kryvian_Concept_desc:0 "The Kryvian Concept was developed by Vaclau Lastouski before the Weltkrieg, believing that as descendants of the Kryvich people before the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, are an Aryan people and the purest of the East Slavic nations. It is time for Belarusians to embrace and protect this identity from the Mongol Muscovites to the East and internationalists within."
 WHR_Expropriate_The_Landlords:0 "Expropriate the Landlords"
 WHR_Expropriate_The_Landlords_desc:0 "For centuries, Belarusians have been a purely peasant nation under Polish and Russian landlords. The socialists, despite their rhetoric, have failed in their promise to help the peasants, trying too hard to please the enemy. Enough is enough; we will seize the lands and give it to the people, no questions asked, no compensation! Kryvians are no longer slaves!"
 WHR_The_Agrarian_Ideal:0 "The Agrarian Ideal"
 WHR_The_Agrarian_Ideal_desc:0 "The Belarusian is, broadly speaking, a poor farmer, and has been for centuries. Even as Kryvians, we are still a people of the land, and agrarian ideals resonate within our souls. We must protect this identity not only in rhetoric, but in action, by uplifting the peasant and the farmer to the level they were always meant to be."
 WHR_Nationalist_Education:0 "Nationalist Education"
 WHR_Nationalist_Education_desc:0 "Our socialist predecessors were of the right mind in ensuring a secular and nationalist education for our people. However, they certainly haven't gone far enough with the nationalist aspect, giving far too many concessions to Jews, Poles, and Russians, while letting leftist agitation seep in. The school curriculum must instil a proud Kryvian identity and a strong character."
 WHR_Anti_Russian_Propaganda:0 "Promote Germanophobia"
 WHR_Anti_Russian_Propaganda_desc:0 "While Syndicalism is a threat, there is no bigger threat than the Hohenzollerns, our old oppressors. They will return, and they will try to destroy us once again, but we cannot allow it to happen. We can never return under their boots, and we will either prevail or die in our struggle for existence."
 WHR_Nation_Above_Class:0 "Nation above Class"
 WHR_Nation_Above_Class_desc:0 "Despite their Marxist ideology, the BSDP has not only completely failed to create a classless society, but further worsened class divisions. Belarusians or Kryvians will no longer be divided by class, for we are one indivisible nation."
 WHR_Nationalism_Under_Reichspakt:0 "Nationalism under the Reichspakt"
 WHR_Nationalism_Under_Reichspakt_desc:0 "There is no shame in admitting that we will need help to keep invaders out, especially with the Muscovites at our border. Germany is our only true ally here, and our nation will likely only survive as part of the Reichspakt. As we work to become a self-reliant nation, Germany will help us towards this goal, and we will remain steadfast allies in the coming storm."
 WHR_Kryvian_Orthodox_Church:0 "Nationalise the Churches"
 WHR_Kryvian_Orthodox_Church_desc:0 "Despite Lastouski's best attempts to convince the people that religion plays no part in national identity, far too many people refuse to let go. As the Catholic Church remains influenced by the Poles and the Orthodox Church by the Muscovites, we must rupture their ties with the foreign enemies. The Churches in Kryvia must be completely subservient to the state."
 WHR_Constitutional_Amendment:0 "Constitutional Amendments"
 WHR_Constitutional_Amendment_desc:0 "The Constitution, full of leftist ideas and values, simply cannot be used by our nation. However, it is not completely unsalvageable. With effort and significant amendments, we can fix it to serve the needs of the Kryvian people and its institutions."
 WHR_The_Rise_of_Kryvia:0 "The Rise of Kryvia"
 WHR_The_Rise_of_Kryvia_desc:0 "With power consolidated within the Kryvian movement, we can truly begin the rebirth of the Belarusian people into the Kryvian nation. We will never be slaves to another invader ever again, and we will not waste the opportunity the Germans have given to our people as we begin to take our place among Europe's nations."

 WHR_Entice_German_Investors:0 "Entice German Investors"
 WHR_Entice_German_Investors_desc:0 "There is currently plenty of resentment towards German companies as they pulled out of our country after Black Monday. However, we cannot let these feelings get in the way of the fact that we need the investors to return and, this time, stay. This will require some fairly generous offers to entice them back into the White Ruthenian market."
 WHR_Consolidate_State_Assets:0 "Consolidate State Assets"
 WHR_Consolidate_State_Assets_desc:0 "Because of the limited amount of capital within the country, the government has been highly active in the economy to help spur development. This means that not only does the state own a significant portion of it, but also bloat and inefficiencies. Consolidated state enterprises and downsizing will help lower state expenses and, in the long-run, improve their efficiency."
 WHR_Loosen_Labour_Laws:0 "Loosen Labour Laws"
 WHR_Loosen_Labour_Laws_desc:0 "The BSDP government, true to their socialist rhetoric, implemented strong and comprehensive labour laws that favoured workers over owners. This makes foreign companies less eager to invest even with the relatively lower costs. Loosening these laws, despite the protests of the All-Belarusian Congress of Trade Unions, will help make investing in our country more attractive."
 WHR_Request_Bail_Out:0 "Request a Bailout"
 WHR_Request_Bail_Out_desc:0 "Even with our best effort and decisions, our economy is simply too weak on its own to cope with the global economic downturn. We will need to make a formal request to the German government to help bail out our economy, likely involving some long-term loans from German banks. We can only hope the Germans will have generous terms for their steadfast ally in the East."

 WHR_Cooperate_With_ZD:0 "Cooperate with Zialiony Dub"
 WHR_Cooperate_With_ZD_desc:0 "Vacłaŭ Łastoŭski's 'Green Oak' organization is a highly interesting group. Upholding unorthodox believes on the origins of our people, they are nonetheless highly nationalistic and somewhat pro-Russian. With a few benefits thrown their way we could forge an alliance and entrench our position in ruling Belarus, or 'Kryvia' if they personally still want to refer to it as such."
 WHR_Nationalism_Under_Moscow:0 "Nationalism under Moscow"
 WHR_Nationalism_Under_Moscow_desc:0 "To anyone saying that nationalism must mean utter cessation of brotherly ties we say ah! Our great big brother, the Russian nation, has only our best interest in mind. With their official support the Belarusian national pride shall flourish and sweep away any internal threat posed by so-called 'patriots'. Nothing more than a bunch of crypto-syndicalists!"
 WHR_Foothold_For_Russian_Army:0 "Foothold for the Russian Army"
 WHR_Foothold_For_Russian_Army_desc:0 "To ensure that our people are secure and protected from foreign aggression, Belarus must be transformed into an unshakable fortress for the brother army of Russia. Not only will that keep us safe, we can observe and learn from Russia's technical war experience and apply their inventions in reforming our armed forces."
 WHR_Initiate_Agrarian_Reforms:0 "Initiate Agrarian Reforms"
 WHR_Initiate_Agrarian_Reforms_desc:0 "A nation cannot thrive nor survive without a steady supply of food. Such a nation will simply die if urgent measures to transform the chaotic land situation are not put in place. We cannot allow Belarus to be that nation. Thus, we set out to solve the Agrarian trouble once and for all, ensuring boundless prosperity for our countrymen."
 WHR_Bolster_Belarusian_Patriotism:0 "Bolster Belarusian Patriotism"
 WHR_Bolster_Belarusian_Patriotism_desc:0 "While we have done much to bolster the national fervor inside great Belarus, it is still not enough. Our people must be proud and ever thankful for being born Belarusian, for forming the unified entity known as Belarus. We are patriots and we are proud."
 WHR_Negotiate_For_Greater_Belarus:0 "Negotiate for Greater Belarus"
 WHR_Negotiate_For_Greater_Belarus_desc:0 "With the cooperation between the brotherly nations of Belarus and Russia unshattered by any threats, the time is right to ask for the return of our favors. A simple and humble request, seeing how much we sacrificed by now. The transfer of rightfully Belarusian lands to our nation, so we can serve as Russia's greatest ally forever."
 WHR_Nationalize_Industry:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
 WHR_Nationalize_Industry_desc:0 "There are certain industries that are vital to the continued existence of our nation. It is simply ridiculous they are allowed to be held by foreign overlords or disloyal businessmen. Immediately, all of such industries will be brought under the aegida of the state."
 WHR_disband_rada:0 "Dissolve the Rada"
 WHR_disband_rada_desc:0 "Despite being a powerless body, the Rada still exists as a measure of the people’s will, and thus is a constant threat to our rule We must enact emergency measures and fully disband the Rada before anyone has a chance to sabotage our regime."
 WHR_orthodox_support:0 "Court The Church"
 WHR_orthodox_support_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church plays a major role in Belarusian society and by gaining the official outspoken support of the Church we can promote our new order to the average population and minimise any resistance."
 WHR_purge_socialists:0 "Purge the Socialists"
 WHR_purge_socialists_desc:0 "Despite years of being on the fringes politically, the syndicalists still maintain quite a bit of support among some in the nation. What’s worse, the social democrats are still perhaps the most popular party within the nation! We must vigorously root out and destroy any lefist sentiments among the populace if our regime is to be unopposed."
 WHR_labour_battalions:0 "Create Labour-Battalions"
 WHR_labour_battalions_desc:0 "Our regime still remains unpopular among many who lack employment. By creating labour battalions and public works programs we can keep the people employed and help to build up White Ruthenia into a strong and modern nation."

 WHR_nachalnik_dzyerzhavy_desc:0 "Stanisłaŭ Bułak-Bałachowič is by far one of the greatest leaders in our history. A warrior, a leader, a father to our people, there is not a thing he cannot accomplish. Having proven his merit in leading Belarus and turning it into a power to be reckoned with,Bułak-Bałachowič shall assume the title of Načalnik Dzyaržavy, the Chief of State. Honoring the legacy of the great Tadevuš Kasciuška."

### Army ###
 WHR_Expand_Army:0 "Creation of the People's Army"
 WHR_Expand_Army_desc:0 "With renewed worries about the Russian threat, there is finally interest in military reform and expansion now that the nation's very survival is at stake. To this end, the Rada has approved the creation of a new People’s Army, taking its name from the late People’s Republic."
 WHR_Revive_BVZR:0 "Revive the Military Central Council"
 WHR_Revive_BVZR_desc:0 "The Belarusian Military Central Council, or Belvaiskrada, was formed in November 1917 to organise the first Belarusian military units, but was disbanded the next year as the German Army occupied Minsk. The purpose of the revived Belvaiskrada is to transform the army into a proper, modern military force that can stand up on its own as much as possible, focusing on the quality of officers, NCOs, and training."
 
 WHR_Create_BKA:0 "Creation of the Belarusian Home Guard"
 WHR_Create_BKA_desc:0 "Two things are clear: The People's Army will never be able to beat back a Russian or German invasion on its own, and the National Guard is too limited in scope to provide for local defence and auxiliary support. As such, the National Guard will be replaced by the Belarusian Home Guard, or BKA, which will focus on mobilising the civilian population and the army reserves for a prolonged guerrilla war against the occupier."
 WHR_Expand_Military_Schools:0 "Expand the Central Military School"
 WHR_Expand_Military_Schools_desc:0 "The Central Military School is the only institution capable of training officers for the People's Army, and they still often have to study in Germany for further instruction. The School is in dire need of expansion if we are to increase the quality of our officers, which will include new facilities and hiring foreign instructors."
 WHR_Improving_NCO:0 "Improving our NCOs"
 WHR_Improving_NCO_desc:0 "Professional officers are important, but non-commissioned officers have also seen significant professionalisation since the Weltkrieg. Their importance in maintaining the link between officers and soldiers is immense, and their role on the frontlines is impossible to overstate. Increasing their training will help increase the quality of the army as a whole, for officers rely on them and soldiers look up to them."
 WHR_Belarusian_Army_Manuals:0 "Belarusian Army Manuals"
 WHR_Belarusian_Army_Manuals_desc:0 "As embarrassing as it is to say, most of our newer manuals are in German, which few Belarusians can read, and the outdated ones in Russian. There are, of course, unofficial translations from educated officers and volunteers, but there are still no formal manuals in Belarusian. With the increasing literacy of the people, it is more than about time to compile modern army manuals in our own language."
 WHR_Formalize_Sappers:0 "Formalise Sappers and Assault Units"
 WHR_Formalize_Sappers_desc:0 "Technical troops in the People's Army remain more-or-less ad-hoc, informal organisations, with engineers often sent to train in Germany. With the growing number of educated technicians in the army, it is time to organise them into formal units. Furthermore, our assault units, also trained on the German model, will also gain formal designations."
 WHR_Motorization_Logistics:0 "Motorisation and Logistics"
 WHR_Motorization_Logistics_desc:0 "If there is one military benefit of being an agrarian nation with increasing agricultural mechanisation, it's that many of our soldiers are familiar with motor vehicles. With the increasing number of trucks and even armoured vehicles on the battlefield, we can use it to improve our logistical situation despite the less-than-ideal infrastructure of the country."
 WHR_Purchase_Heavy_Equipment:0 "Heavy Equipment Purchase"
 WHR_Purchase_Heavy_Equipment_desc:0 "It is safe to say that Belarus will not produce heavy military equipment in large numbers in the near future, making us dependent on importing them from our allies. With an increasing need for trucks, radios, and artillery on the modern battlefield, we will have to start securing a stockpile of heavy materiel before it is too late."
 WHR_Dnieper_Dvina_Line:0 "Dnieper-Dvina Line"
 WHR_Dnieper_Dvina_Line_desc:0 "While the border on the rivers Dnieper and Dvina cuts us off from well over a million Belarusians under Russian oppression, it gives us and our allies a far better defensive position when the Russians inevitably return. Despite being part of Germany's Ostwall project, the Belarusian section was seriously neglected, presenting a weakpoint in the Reichspakt. We must prepare our defences before it is too late."
 WHR_Auxillary_Battalions:0 "Auxiliary Battalions"
 WHR_Auxillary_Battalions_desc:0 "In order to mobilise as much of the population as possible, auxiliary battalions are to be formed from reservists, veterans, and civilian volunteers to support military operations. This will increase the number of available manpower for the armed forces and decrease the amount of training necessary for new formations."
 WHR_Militarize_Police:0 "Militarise Police Units"
 WHR_Militarize_Police_desc:0 "Local police units provide us with an interesting opportunity for military operations. As they are already trained to provide security and are very familiar with the local situation they serve in, they will prove invaluable in organising local resistance to the occupier and help funnel arms to partisans."
 WHR_Local_Munitions:0 "Local Munitions Production"
 WHR_Local_Munitions_desc:0 "When it came to establishing military industries, Belarus was thoroughly ignored during the Tsarist era. As such, the country lacks even the basic facilities to produce ammunition. In order to reduce our dependence on foreign imports and as an important entry-point in developing a military industrial sector, we will begin constructing facilities able to produce rifle and pistol ammunition."
 WHR_Partisan_Warfare:0 "Partisan Warfare"
 WHR_Partisan_Warfare_desc:0 "Sadly, it is very likely that in the case of an invasion, parts of our country will be overrun by the enemy. However, the Belarusian people are already experienced with partisan warfare since the Russian Civil War.

 WHR_mass_illiteracy_desc:0 "The majority of the White Ruthenian population consists of illiterate peasants. Since gaining independence, the country has invested significant resources to create and improve a national education system, to little avail."

 WHR_agrarian_society:0 "Agrarian Society"
 WHR_agrarian_society_desc:0 "When White Ruthenia was fighting for its independence and national revival, the largely socialist Rada initially outlawed private ownership of land and called for the redistribution of all large estates without compensation to landowners, largely ethnic Poles. However, this policy was quickly tempered as the Rada sought support from the German Empire and the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party was forced to install a monarchy.. As such, more moderate land redistribution, which included compensation to landlords, has been in place since 1921. However, the slow pace and numerous problems encountered led to criticism within the BSDP and from its leftist coalition partners, calling for a radical policy to replace it as the Belarusian Socialist Hramada had promised back in 1917."

 WHR_agrarian_society_2:0 "Modernising Agrarian Society"
 WHR_agrarian_society_2_desc:0 "With the growth of industry in the country, the issues of rural overpopulation and unproductive agriculture are being mitigated by growing urbanisation and the redistribution of land to a growing class of smallholders.

 WHR_weak_national_identity:0 "Weak National Identity"
 WHR_weak_national_identity_desc:0 "While many nations in Eastern Europe have experienced a national awakening in the second half of the 19th century, the idea of a Belarusian nation only started to appear in the early 20th century. By the time Russia fell to the Bolsheviks, very few Belarusians could even comprehend the idea of nationalism, let alone embrace it, and many even considered Belarusians to be nothing but Polonised Russians or poor, uncultured peasants unworthy of the title of "nation". Since 1917, Belarusian intellectuals have been fighting an uphill battle to bring education and, through it, national identity to the poor, illiterate peasants of the region. Even now, the majority of the population is apathetic at best or hostile at worst to the idea of Belarusian nationhood."

This helped raise the literacy level significantly, but it still falls short compared to our neighbours and remains unacceptably low compared to the rest of Europe.

 WHR_Quatrillingualism:0 "Personal Principle"
 WHR_Quatrillingualism_desc:0 "The Personal Principle was developed by the Austrian Social-Democratic Workers' Party as a way to tackle the question of nationalism in their multiethnic state. This involves detaching the nation (as in, the people) from the land they reside in. This is particularly useful to avoid bifurcating states that do not have clear ethnic lines. Instead, cultural and educational institutions are handled by a council representing a particular ethnicity, ensuring that they have autonomy in their national affairs."

Now, however, recent events have proven that our very survival is dependent on deep cooperation, and this old idea will help both nations weather future storms. Long live the brotherly union of Lithuanian and Belarusian Peoples!"

### Leader Descriptions ###

POLITICS_USIEVALAD_IHNATOUSKI_DESC:0 "Usievalad Makaravič Ihnatoŭski began his political career as a member of the Russian Socialist-Revolutionary Party in 1902. After getting into trouble with the Tsarist authorities and expelled from the University of Saint Petersburg, he enrolled at the Yurievsky (Dorpat/Tartu) University, graduating in 1911 before working as a teacher at the Minsk Pedagogical Institute. He would work there until 1921, and for most of the Weltkrieg, he appeared loyal to the government despite his rebellious past. Nevertheless, by 1917, he was the head of an organisation called Young Belarus, becoming a member of the Belarusian Socialist Hramada. When the Hramada split in 1918, he joined the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, opposing the government of the Belarusian People's Republic's pro-German stance. However, he also grew disillusioned by the BPS-R's anti-Bolshevik stance.\n\nWhen BPS-R co-founder Tamaš Hryb called for cooperation with the puppet monarchy of the Germans, Ihnatoŭski leaded a split from the BPS-R, forming the underground Belarusian Revolutionary Organisation. While he became a member of the Belarusian Institute of Culture, later the Academy of Sciences, he made contacts with émigrés in Paris and the Third International. Now that the World Revolution has reached Belarus, Ihnatoŭski and his cadre of revolutionaries are at the helm of the Belarusian Workers' Socialist Republic, implementing an authoritarian left-populist program to bring socialism to his native land."
POLITICS_TAMAS_HRYB_DESC:0 "The co-founder of the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries was born from a poor peasant family. Before the Weltkrieg, he worked at the Baltic Shipyard in Saint Petersburg and became involved in Belarusian literary circles in the city. In 1914, he was drafted into the Russian Army and remained in service until 1917. He was elected to the All-Belarusian Congress in December 1917 as one of several representatives of Belarusian soldiers fighting on the Romanian Front, and was arrested by Bolshevik authorities when it was suppressed. When he was freed, he became involved in the creation of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR) as a member of the Rada (Council) of the BNR and the Central Military Council. He and the BPS-R became outspoken supporters of complete independence for Belarus, but they could not convince the Rada to change their pro-German orientation. He would be imprisoned twice in 1919 by German authorities for actively opposing the occupation and only released when the BNR was officially recognised by Germany in 1920.\n\nAs it became clear that the German presence could not be opposed any longer, Hryb called for the BPS-R to work with other leftist parties in the newly-established Rada, causing a minor split in the party. From 1925 onward, the BPS-R maintained a presence within the successive Social-Democratic governments, representing the Peasants' and Workers' Hramada's radical wing.\n\nHryb would remain suspected by German authorities the whole time, and he remained careful about any affiliation with the Third International, even if his sympathies were an open secret. With the World Revolution having spread to Belarus, however, there is no longer any reason to hold back as the BPS-R begins work at implementing their full left-populist program, with their co-founder at the head of the Belarusian Workers' Socialist Republic."
POLITICS_BRANISLAU_TARASKIEVIC_DESC:0 "Coming from a peasant family of modest means, Branisłaŭ Adamavič Taraškievič became involved in the Belarusian national movement during his studies in Vilnius. In 1911, he continued his education in Saint Petersburg, where he became acquainted with the nationalist poet Janka Kupala. Because of his excellent grades, he was easily admitted into the Faculty of History and Philology of Saint Petersburg University, where he studied under numerous accomplished linguists. He returned to Minsk in 1917, deeply involved with the Belarusian Socialist Hramada and the foundation of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR) the following year. When the Hramada split in 1918, he found himself on the side of the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party, which pursued a pragmatically pro-German path, rejected Soviet Russia and its degeneration into \"bureaucratic socialism\", and wished to create a free democratic socialist state through reforms.\n\nAfter serving in the People's Ministry of Education, Taraškievič quickly rose up the BSDP's central committee. With the fall of the Monarchy, Taraškievič stands as head of the BSDP and now Belarus itself, wishing to see the Republic transformed into a true socialist paradise."

With the fall of the Monarchy, Taraškievič stands as head of the BSDP and now Belarus itself, wishing to see the Republic transformed into a true socialist paradise. As such, it was no surprise that when the opportunity presented itself, he and the Hramada defected to the Third Internationale, working with them to continue their work towards a democratic and socialist Belarusian People's Republic."
POLITICS_MIKOLA_ABRAMCIK_DESC:0 "When the Belarusian People's Republic declared its independence, Mikola Abramčyk was only fourteen years old, but he was soon involved in national politics in 1921 as a representative from Vileyka, but continued his education in 1924 at the Belarusian State University. As an active member of the Association of Belarusian Student Organisations, Abramčyk became a member of the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists as a close associate and protégé of Vasil Zacharka. After earning a degree in engineering and economics, he was involved in the All-Belarusian Congress of Trade Unions while further splitting his time with prolific writing and reading. After 1930, he was involved with Belarusian migrant workers in Germany and, in 1932, he founded the Union of Belarusian Emigrant Workers and published the Bulletin of Belarusian Workers in Germany. There, he made his anti-communard sentiments very clear and made sure to limit the influence of the Third International within the Belarusian labour movement.\n\nWhile a relatively young face in Belarusian politics, few can deny his activity within the Belarusian national and labour movements as a writer, teacher, and politician. What is certain is that he is likely to have a very long political career."
POLITICS_ADAM_STANKIEVIC_DESC:0 "Hailing for Vilnius, Adam Vikienćjevič Stankievič was ordained a Catholic priest in 1914. During his studies at the Petrograd Roman Catholic Theological Academy, he became a member of the Belarusian Circle, a group of Belarusian Catholic students there, and he would become one of the founders of Belarusian Christian Democracy (BKhD) in 1917. He became one of the leaders of the Belarusian community in Lithuania, becoming widely respected for his tireless charity work.\n\nAt the 4th Congress of the BKhD in December 1931, he was elected member of its central committee and became involved in politics in White Ruthenia. There, he helped strengthen the National-Democratic Association as Christian Democracy gained a stronger voterbase, working with the informal Orthodox wing of the movement, the Peasants' Union (not to be confused with the Peasant Party), presenting an increasingly valid opposition to the political hegemony of the Hramada.\n\n.In a way, this is a victory for Belarusian democracy as a proof of its health, and Stankievič played a key part. It appears that the esteemed priest will be leading the Belarusian people towards further prosperity with his dedication to humanitarianism and the well-being of his people."
POLITICS_RADASLAU_ASTROUSKI_DESC:0 "Radasłaŭ Kazimiravič Astroŭski is no stranger to revolution, having participated in the 1905 Revolution, getting arrested in 1911 for revolutionary unrest, and serving the Russian Provisional Government after the February Revolution of 1917. Like many early Belarusian nationalists, he worked to secure his nation's autonomy within the Russian Republic, but loudly decried the October Revolution and became an early proponent for the independence of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR) as a delegate to the All-Belarusian Congress of December 1917.\n\nAfter volunteering for military service after the creation of the Belarusian People's Army, he worked for the People's Ministry of Education for most of the 20s, joining the Peasants' and Workers' Hramada. During this time, while initially seeming to drift towards the left-wing of the bloc, he soon found himself alienated as it grew closer to the rhetoric of the Third Internationale. By 1936, his views had shifted dramatically and he had become an outspoken member of the bloc's right-wing, criticising the growth of Syndicalist influence within the Hramada as dangerous and foreign.\n\nNow, his time in the Hramada has become irrelevant as they refused to heed his warnings. After coming into conflict with the chairman of the Hramada, Branisłaŭ Taraškievič, Astroŭski began to work against them behind the scenes, knowing that the BSDP wouldn't be dislodged by legal means, organising the group of dissident politicians and army officers that would become the Belarusian Central Rada after overthrowing the Taraškievič government. While the coup had mixed results, it has become clear that the Hramada is no longer a threat to the nation, saved from a dangerous Syndicalist plot. It remains to be seen whether the Chairman of the Central Rada can truly bring order and stability to White Ruthenia."
POLITICS_VACLAU_LASTOUSKI_DESC:0 "Vacłaŭ Justynavič Łastoŭski is one of the most prominent Belarusian nationalists and a long-time member of the Belarusian national movement. His involvement reaches back to 1906 when he first joined the Belarusian Socialist Hramada and was editor of the association's newspaper \"Nasha Niva\" until 1914. He was a prolific author and historian, managing the Belarusian Publishing Society since its founding in 1915, actively contributing to the cultural and national development of Belarus. As an outspoken supporter of Belarusian independence, he was a member of the Belarusian Council in Vilnius and joined the Rada of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR). As part of the Rada, he supported the BNR's declaration of independence before, as a vocal supporter of close Lithuanian-Belarusian relations, representing Belarusian interests in the Lithuanian diplomatic mission in Berlin.\n\nIn 1919, Łastoŭski joined the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, but would quickly come into conflict over foreign policy and tactics with its central committee and would split with them the next year. He would then support the government's pro-German orientation after joining Viačaslaŭ Adamovič's Belarusian Peasant Party (Green Oak) and would become a key member of the Belarusian Institute of Culture, Inbelcult, after its foundation in 1922, and later in 1928 when it was transformed into the Belarusian Academy of Sciences. \n\nBy 1936, Łastoŭski had become the head of Green Oak's political wing and its chief ideologue. Despite his early involvement with socialists, he had always been critical of Marxism and class warfare, and always put national interests over class. More importantly, he consistently denied the idea of any kind of Russian-Belarusian unity, seeking to deepen ties with the Baltic nations instead and to purge as much Russian influence as possible. His anti-Russian sentiments bled into his writings, considering the \"Muscovite\" people as Mongol, while Belarusians, as the descendants of the medieval Kryvich tribe, were the \"true Slavs\" and even part of the Aryan race. In his goal to purge all Russian influences, he believes the Belarusian nation and identity should be renamed to match their ancestors: Kryvian.\n\nWith a revanchist Russian state to the east, it certainly does appear that the Kryvian people will be fighting for its very survival, and it will be a bloody battle."
POLITICS_WERNER_KEMPF_DESC:0 "Werner Kempf is neither a friend or foe of the Belarusians. He is a Prussian officer through and through, and his objective is simply: Prepare White Ruthenia for an invasion from the East. As much of the country must be mobilised for the war effort as possible before it is too late, else the Russians will punch through a weak link in the Ostwall and pour west between Polesia and the Baltic. Kempf has no concern for the people there; the Central Rada can handle internal affairs, and his priority is the military situation, and he expects the White Ruthenians to cooperate as much as possible. After all, their survival depends on the German Army; neither they nor he can afford to lose."

whrpol.1.t:0 "White Ruthenia - Starting Situation"
whrpol.1.d:0 "The troubled birth of the White Ruthenia, took place in the backdrop of the Weltkrieg and the Russian Civil War. When the German Army entered Minsk in February 1918, they were largely unaware of the peoples that lived in the region, assuming the East Slavic people there were merely Russians under an old Polish aristocracy. In the immediate aftermath of the Brest-Litovsk treaty and withdrawal of the Russian troops from Belarus, the All-Belarusian Congress declared the formation of the Belarusian People's Republic catching even Germany by surprise. In their defence, the Belarusian National Revival had only begun in the 1890s and was largely restricted to a small, but growing, urban intelligentsia, and the first Belarusian political party, the Belarusian Socialist Assembly, commonly called the Hramada, was only founded in 1903.\n\nNevertheless, the Germans were quick to exploit the unfolding situation as they steadily delegated powers to the Belarusian National Council, or Rada, from 1918 onwards. Having witnessed the Bolsheviks forcefully disband the All-Belarusian Congress merely two months before their arrival, the German Army saw a way to weaken Russian, and therefore Bolshevik, power in the region, and limit Polish influence in Eastern Europe by supporting the creation of a White Ruthenian state, albeit under close German supervision.\n\nThe independence of White Ruthenia would be recognised through the Treaty of Minsk in 1920, although its borders were far smaller than the Rada had hoped as the Germans favoured a more defensible border on the Dnieper and Dvina. While this was met with disappointment by Belarusian nationalists, they had no way to press their claims. Nevertheless, it curbed the BNR's ambitions to a more manageable area, for it was clear to even the staunchest nationalist that Belarusian national identity was weak and the Republic had limited popular support.\n\nIn late 1920, the Rada ceded its powers to the promised Constituent Assembly, which adopted a constitution and held elections to the Rada, the parliament of the People's Republic."

whrpol.intro.d:0 "However, the young republic faced two problems at once in the face of Germany and the troops it deployed on the territory of Belarus, and the Socialists who won the elections to the constituent Assembly.\n\nThe Belarussian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, inspired by their counterparts in Russia, has won a landslide majority in the Assembly and immediately demanded socialization of land, power to the peasant councils and other \"unauthorized\" slogans – a move, which was regarded by Kaiserreich as a provocation. In merely one month the Constituent Assembly was dissolved and a pro-German government was installed instead. The powerful German Empire demanded reformation of the state into a Prussian-style semi-constitutional monarchy, with Wilhelm II’s brother Heinrich as King. Not wishing to suffer the same fate as the BPSR, now dominant in Rada, the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party agreed, handing the crown to Heinrich, taking the regal name Genrykh. The White Ruthenian government under Genrykh’s supervision began a programme of land reform and education programs, both doomed to end in failure. Illiteracy remained mostly endemic, not helped by the inability of Belarusian nationalists to decide between a Latin or Cyrillic script for their revival of the Belarusian language. After Heinrich's death, his son Waldemar ascended to the throne as Uladzimir I. Plagued with the recurring effects of haemophilia and not trained to any reasonable level in statecraft, Uladzimir has proven ineffective in giving the country the rule it so desperately needs.\n\n A powerless Rada acts as the sole way for the people to voice their opinion, which is often ignored by the King, despite the declared 'coalition government' with Right Hramadist BPS-F and Christian Democracy. What's more, the political status quo is currently being disturbed by the machinations of Uladzimir's brother and head of the NBP secret police Žyhimont, a figure that sees himself as the rightful heir to the throne. The controversial Prince has made contact with some politicians in Belarusian Independent Party (BNP) in his barely concealed plotting to seize the throne from his Germanophile brother. With three factions all just waiting for their chance to size power in Belarus, the future seems bleak indeed."

whrpol.2.t:0 "The Necessity of Reform"
whrpol.2.d:0 "The Social-Democrats take great pride in their victory against the conservatives. However, one of the main concerns in the mind of Belarusians during the foundation of the People's Republic, and later the Kingdom, was land reform. Belarusians were, for the most part, merely landless peasants, and most of the land was owned by Polish or, to a smaller extent, Russian aristocrats, which was seen as the greatest impediment to Belarusian nation-building and economic prosperity. Nowadays, most of the land is finally in the hands of Belarusian smallholders, but there are still many landless peasants and many hectares of land owned by \"foreign\" aristocrats or one of the two churches in the country. For many, it is clear that Plan Sierada, the informal name of the land reform program long proposed by the Minister of Agriculture has much work to do. Many have grown frustrated by the lack of progress as the Ministry of Agriculture quickly runs out of funds as they compensate former landowners during the ownership transfer.\n\nWhile the majority of the BSDP insists that progress has been steady, there is growing internal opposition not only within the Hramada, but the leading party itself. As the party internally debates how to help finalise the Plan, it remains to be seen whether they will decide on an increased budget or something far more radical as many within the party are calling for with increasing support."
whrpol.2.a:0 "Smallholding is the future of land ownership."

whrpol.3.t:0 "The Sierada Report"
whrpol.3.d:0 "The need for land reform in Belarus has been recognised for decades. The landowning class in the country has been overwhelmingly Polish or Russian, with the former having by far the biggest share, while the majority of ethnic Belarusians were peasants, few of them owning the land they worked. This led to considerable class tensions up to the Weltkrieg, especially as the national consciousness of the Belarusian people began to grow in the lead-up to the Weltkrieg. As such, as a way to cement the creation of Belarusian national identity, uplift the peasantry from crippling poverty, and weaken the power of the landed gentry, land reform has been part of the political programs of most political parties.\n\nHowever, it would prove easier said than done. While the radical left (and, increasingly, the radical right as well) has long preached for the seizure and redistribution of land by the government, the monarchy refused, save in a few token cases. As such, Plan Sierada, named after the recently appointed Minister for Agriculture from the Hramada, behind it, has much to work towards.\n\nIn his report, Jan Sierada has highlighted the land reform's projected successes, especially in its first year. Sierada concludes that the land reform program can be completed before 1939, earlier with extra funding, while emphasising that compensation to landowners have had a net positive effect as they invested in different economic sectors."

The Socialist-Revolutionaries have long criticised the plan as reactionary and far too forgiving to the \"foreign\" landowners. Compensating for all the lands redistributed has been a massive state expense which the budget has struggled to handle, with cuts largely responsible for the Plan's slowed progress. The left-wing of the BSDP, informally led by Prime Minister Symon Rak-Mihailovski, have taken the same position as the BPS-R, and even President Taraškievič has begun to consider a radical change of plans.\n\nJan Sierada, People's Minister for Agriculture and a member of the BPS-F, has tirelessly defended his Plan both within the Hramada and at the Rada, and believes a budget increase will be more than enough to get it back on track. Informal leader of the BSDP's right-wing, Anton Lutskevich, has warned that a radical course would alienate their German ally, already cautious of the Hramada's open socialist leaning, and fears that they would support reactionary elements in the People's Army and Rada against them should they adopt a dangerous \"Bolshevik\" plan.\n\nThe future direction of the Hramada belongs to centrists of the BSDP, who will tip the favour between Sierada's moderate proposal, or succumb to the Socialist-Revolutionary's pressure and their populist rhetoric."

It wouldn't be until 1918, under the direction of the BNR Rada and with German support did the literacy rate of the country begin to improve through the manifold expansion of the school system. In 1926, the Ministry of Education reported a 36% literacy rate that year, and this year it was approaching the 50% milestone.

While the opposition on its own is too weak to topple the government and call for elections, their delays created a tense situation in parliament. As the session was adjourned yesterday, numerous insults had been thrown around, and there were rumours that both the BSDP and the Hramada was on the verge of collapse while many people in Minsk have witnessed increased activity at the House of the People's Army and the German embassy."

In front of Government House, where Rada sessions are held, an armoured car and a platoon of soldiers watch over Independence Square, while the capital's radio stations were also occupied and interrupted regular transmission. Later in the morning, the First National Station broadcast a message by Žyhimont, the King’s brother. Taraškievič's government had been deposed by the army for collusion with \"foreign, syndicalist elements\", planning to subvert the deadlocked Rada through a revolution. Furthermore, he announced that the government was replaced by a new temporary authority, the Belarusian Council of Ministers, or Rada Ministrav, with Radaslau Astrouski, Rada delegate for the BNP as its chairman. After the composition of the Rada was declared, he ended the message by issuing the order to arrest Taraškievič and other members of the former government for high treason.\n\nWhile all roads going in and out of Minsk had military checkpoints by noon, it was clear that all members of the former government had avoided arrest and had fled the city. White Ruthenia appeared on the path of civil war."

Practically no fellow members of the BSDP have accepted his call for support and national unity against the syndicalist threat despite having assured his army backers that he would rally at least the right-wing of the party behind him. At this point, his Central Rada is proving to be an embarrassing failure.\n\nThis situation has driven Astrouski to approach other parties in the Rada, which has, thus far, not been recalled since the start of the coup. Specifically, Astrouski is hoping to gain the support of the National Democratic Association consisting of Raman Skirmunt's People's Party and Adam Stankievič's Christian Democracy. With their support, the Central Rada would gain the legitimacy it needs to function as the Hramada has entered a state of open revolt in the countryside.\n\nIn meeting with its leaders, Chairman Astrouski offered key positions to National Democrats within the Central Rada and promised the restoration of the Rada as soon as possible- excluding \"treasonous\" Hramada members, of course- in exchange for support for a new constitution and against \"syndicalist rebels\". The Christian Democrats are particularly reluctant to cooperate, seeing the coup as illegitimate and a terrible legal precedent, but their concerns over letting the military rule alone or, perhaps worse, letting Lastouski's Kryvians gain power, may convince them to side with the Central Rada."

With the lukewarm support of the left secured at the congress, the bill passed with relative ease as it was supported by the National Democratic Association. Opposition to the bill was largely left to the Kryvians that argued, as the left-wing had within the Hramada before them, it was still too lenient towards landowners. However, their opposition proved fairly weak, and Lastouski, leader of the Kryvians, acquiesced that the new bill would help support peasants threatened by Germany's economic crisis.\n\nLeftist papers \"Bielaruskaja Dumka\" was mildly critical of the BPS-R's support of the bill, reserving their harsh judgement on Lastouski, himself a former member of that party until 1920. In their opinion, Lastouski's opposition to the bill was disingenuous and merely a ploy to co-opt leftists to his reactionary movement. Lastouski himself, though his paper \"Kryvich\", was quick to retort, accusing the BPS-R of abandoning their core support base and continuing to \"sell out\" to internationalism instead of helping develop the Belarusian-Kryvian nation.\n\nEither way, it appears the radicals on both sides are wasting their venom on each other, letting us focus on work that will actually benefit the people."

This caused an uproar on the left and right, with the right accusing the Jews of making the government their puppet while the left accuses the government of prioritising one labour organisation over the others.

Nowadays, the dominant organisation representing Jews and Jewish interests is the General Jewish Labour Bund, or simply Bund.\n\nThe Bund is a progressive organisation heavily inspired by Austrian social-democracy. Their program of Jewish autonomism, inspired by the Austromarxist Personal Principle, hopes to achieve self-rule and cultural autonomy wherever the Diaspora resides without resorting to the creation of a Jewish state. They have been successful in making the Personal Principle enshrined into the Constitution and the adoption of Yiddish as an official language alongside Belarusian, and have been longtime partners of the Social-Democratic Party as part of the Peasants' and Workers' Union. Their opposition within the Jewish community, Labour Zionists and Folkists, have been significantly marginalised since the 1920s.\n\nThe alliance between the BSDP and the Bund has proven to be a powerful force in Belarusian politics.

In the process, however, they have taken direct control of all military forces and affairs in the country, with Werner Kempf becoming the virtual military dictator over the country with the creation of the Generalgouvernement Minsk. Astrouski's Central Rada maintains control of civilian affairs but has effectively become subordinate to Governor-General Kempf. This is a serious humiliation and White Ruthenia has lost significant sovereignty in the process."

The Lithuanian government has decided to revive an old proposal: A federation of our two nations, just as it was before the partitions of the Commonwealth. The idea had been briefly revived during the Weltkrieg, but was ultimately shelved from lack of interest in the governments of Lithuania, Belarus, and Germany. Perhaps now is the time to consolidate our efforts in order to better defend ourselves from invaders, but many decry the idea that we are trading our independence for security."

Now that everyone involved is very aware that the [WHR.GetAdjective] government cannot stand on its own, the idea is being considered once again. As the protector of both nations, we have the final say in the matter: Allow them to unify and form a more cohesive defence of our eastern frontier, or keep them divided and weak so that they cannot possibly threaten our regional hegemony in the future."

With his homeland overrun, he called for the Lithuanian nation to carry the mantle of the old Grand Duchy and help towards the liberation of Belarus. Perhaps more surprisingly, he also called for much closer ties, to the point of suggesting a union, in order to avoid Lithuania and Belarus from falling to foreign enemies once more.\n\nHis speech closed with a final cry for unity: \"Long live the brotherly union of Lithuanian and Belarusian Peoples!\""

whrpol.37.t:0 "An Offer From Minsk"
whrpol.37.d:0 "With the collapse of the German Empire, it is clear that our [WHR.GetAdjective] enemies have found themselves in deep trouble. Without their protector, they are now vulnerable from a counter-attack by our forces. However, an emissary from [WHR.GetNameDef] has arrived with an interesting offer: A separate peace between our nations.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume, the diplomat argues, that even though they have become diplomatically isolated, he has made it clear that his government are already approaching the Third International for support, seemingly confident that his government, full of sympathisers for Paris and London, can make a convincing appeal to the Syndicalist world now that they have \"broken their chains\" from Berlin. More importantly, he is convinced that further hostilities will only create more unnecessary bloodshed and countless more thousands dead Russians and Belarusians. As such, his government offers not only peace between Belarus and Russia, but also to turn their arms against the remnants of the Reichspakt, in exchange for the formal transfer of \"rightfully Belarusian\" lands.\n\nWe have little doubt that we can crush them eventually, but the idea that we can avoid having to carve a bloody path to Minsk in exchange of some borderlands is one that we may want to consider, especially if their claims of International support is true. Depending on the situation on the front, however, we may be able to insist on a better deal. The ethnic situation in Krichev and Vitebsk are fairly clear, but much less so in Smolensk, which they also claim. Of course, we can also insist on the pre-war status quo."

whrpol.38.t:0 "The Russian Counter-Offer"
whrpol.38.d_split:0 "The [RUS.GetName] has taken interest in our offer of a separate peace, but feel that our demands are too extreme. Specifically, they consider the city of Smolensk to be a core Russian city and refuse to consider ceding it. This does implicitly mean that our claims to the cities of Vitebsk and Krichev are recognised by the Russians and gives us a good chance to reclaim the majority of Belarusian-inhabited lands that were stuck under Russian rule."
whrpol.38.d_statusquo:0 "The Russian response to our offer of a separate peace was lukewarm to say the least. While they are willing to accept our independence, they refuse any territorial changes and demand the return to the pre-war status quo. This would mean that the blood shed by Belarusians would be largely for naught, but it may be the only way to save our nation from a potentially-deadly Russian counter-offensive."

whrpol.40.d:0 "The Russians have accepted our offer; there will be peace between our nations.

whrpol.40.a:0 "Surely, President Taraškievič won't fail us."

whrpol.41.t:0 "Belarus Breaks its Chains?"
whrpol.41.d:0 "With the fall of the perfidious German Empire, it hasn't taken long before Eastern Europe fell into chaos without their imperialist protector. One important case is the Belarusian People's Republic, led by a string of social-democratic governments since 1925. An emissary from Minsk arrived today with not only a peace offer from his government, but for Belarus to turn their arms against the remnants of the Reichspakt.\n\nThe diplomat quickly pleaded his case: The Belarusian Social-Democratic Party has always been working towards the establishment of a socialist state in their corner of Europe, having finally freed themselves from Russian imperialism, then from the foreign, enemy class of Polish noblemen. The emissary insists that their alignment with the German Empire was never their choice and merely a pragmatic ruse to build socialism under their very noses until their poor, under-developed country was ready for a revolution, else it would be squashed by the imperialist Germans or by the reactionaries of Russia that refuse to even recognise their nationhood.\n\nIt is up to us to decide whether we can trust these supposed revolutionaries-in-disguise and offer them our support and protection. Our response here will decide if we can secure an ally in Eastern Europe or if the Russians will begin their counter-offensive against the remnants of the Reichspakt."
whrpol.41.a:0 "We welcome all free peoples of Europe!"

whrpol.42.d:0 "Our offer has been accepted by the revolutionaries of Europe and we have been accepted into the Third International. Of course, there are caveats in this deal, as we have to quickly prove that we are indeed a true revolutionary regime ourselves.\n\nAn emergency session of the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Hramada was held, formally sanctioning the government's plan to make peace with the International and make efforts to join them. This was quickly followed by an emergency of the Rada, rapidly passing a set of laws formally renouncing our ties with the fallen German Empire and announcing the government's intention to re-align the nation with the Syndicalist powers. Finally, a resolution was passed calling for the creation of a constitutional committee and the Rada's dissolution."

whrpol.44.t:0 "Belarus Abandoned"
whrpol.44.d:0 "Despite their best efforts, the illegitimate Belarusian government was unable to back their threats up once it was clear that the Third International was unwilling to support them. Our agreement with them is to be considered null-and-void, with hostilities to resume immediately."
whrpol.44.a:0 "We will march into Minsk after all."

whrpol.45.t:0 "Peace with Belarus"
whrpol.45.d:0 "As per our agreement with the Belarusian government, a peace treaty was signed, officially mediated by the Third International, who also signed a treaty with the so-called Belarusian People's Republic. Belarus is now to be considered part of the Syndicalist sphere, but we will not have to sacrifice any more Russians for useless marshlands and forests."
whrpol.45.a:0 "So be it."

whrpol.46.t:0 "Anti-Government Protests"
whrpol.46.d:0 "The response to the final resolutions adopted before the dissolution of the Rada has been controversial. The opposition is openly decrying it as unconstitutional and consider it a blatant self-coup and there have been protests in the streets. This was followed by counter-protests by faithful workers and peasants, which has led to clashes in Minsk and Mogilev. The army has stepped in to restore order in some places, ensuring that the situation did not escalate further, but it is clear that our swift decision will take some time to be accepted by some segments of the population."
whrpol.46.a:0 "They will accept the revolution soon enough."

whrpol.47.t:0 "A Formal Request from [WHR.GetNameDef]"
whrpol.47.d:0 "With the peace settled and our European hegemony more secured than ever, our loyal ally on what was once the eastern frontier of Mitteleuropa we usually call White Ruthenia, has made a formal request through their embassy in Berlin. For most of the interwar period, the Belarusians have been dependent on our protection and economic power to rise itself from a backwater to a nation, as they claim, equal to the rest of Europe. With their eastern claims secured and Russian threat all but destroyed, the [WHR.GetAdjective] ambassador believes that a new relationship between our nations should be considered. Specifically, one between two free nations rather than protector and vassal.\n\nIn short, the [WHR.GetAdjective] government is hoping to attain full independence within the Reichspakt and Mitteleuropa, ending their unofficial status as a puppet state of the German Empire, as a reward for loyalty throughout this bloody conflict. As there is no reason for [WHR.GetNameDef] to break away from the Reichspakt, with their loyalty thoroughly proven, there really is no reason for us to maintain a leash on them, and it would make them even more grateful for our role in their liberation. On the other hand, hardliners that have the Kaiser's ear are livid that they have the gall to make such a proposition in the first place, as their very existence is due to German goodwill."
whrpol.47.a:0 "Very well. Ludendorff would be happy to see this moment."
whrpol.47.b:0 "Of course not. Ungrateful Slavs..."

whrpol.48.t:0 "Independence!"
whrpol.48.d:0 "The German government has gratefully accepted our request.

Writing about his land of birth:\n\n\"Belorussia is seemingly a complete rejection of the status quo of Poland, where the Poles stood at the top and Jews at the bottom. In Belorussia, Jews, Poles, Belarusians and Russians all have equal rights and accommodations, a truly inspiring ideal for the Zionist movement.\" Katznelson met and argued with senior Bund members in Minsk regarding the merits of the Zionist ideal, Katznelson admitted that the success of the Jewish Bund in Eastern Europe inspired him to create a Zionist united workers front in Palestine, even if he may disagree with the \"Exilism\" of the Jewish Bund. \"I wish our boys knew how to receive an opponent so warmly.\" Katznelson is only one of several prominent Zionist activists around Eastern Europe, which sheds light on the vibrancy of Jewish life in Belarus and other countries."

whrmisc.16.d:0 "The world of the arts in [WHR.GetNameDef] is ever changing, and music is no exception. In order to pool their resources together, the State Symphony Orchestra, State Choir, National Folk Orchestra and Dance Ensemble formed the State Philharmonic. The demand for live musical performances has sharply increased since independence, and many people are willing to attend them despite the lack of modern facilities, accepting the uncomfortable seating and makeshift sets to satisfy their craving for beautiful classical and folk songs. The current main goal of the Philharmonic is to secure state support to build a proper, modern concert hall and the facilities needed for practice, for despite the symbolic importance of the National Theatre building, it has proven to be too small, uncomfortable, and with very poor acoustics for orchestral and choir music.\n\nFor the time being, however, the Philharmonic displays the growth of performance arts in [WHR.GetNameDef]. The State Symphony Orchestra has been touring neighbouring states, and their performances in Ukraine gained particular acclaim. The future is bright for the increasing number of talented Belarusian musicians."

whrmisc.17.d:0 "Liavon Ivanavič Dubiejkaŭski, architect, writer, and politician, passed away today at the age of 71 of stomach cancer. For his great contributions to Belarusian culture, he has been granted a state funeral and many esteemed academicians, political figures, and many other notables will be in attendance.\n\nBorn in 1864 in the village of Dubiejkava near [243.GetName], Dubiejkaŭski was born into a small noble family that, like many, had fallen from grace after the partitions of Poland. He was interested in Belarusian culture from an early age, collecting folklore and writing down oral accounts, dabbling in writing himself with fables and poetry. Against the wishes of his parents, he moved to Warsaw to study construction and architecture. As a professional builder from the 1890s on, he worked to restore numerous Catholic churches around the Belarusian lands. In 1893, he was contracted to build the Immaculate Conception Church in [242.GetName] and, from then on, founded his own successful construction company. After the Russo-Japanese War, however, the construction industry crashed and he liquidated his business, leaving for Paris to further his studies in architecture.\n\nDubiejkaŭski became acquainted with the Belarusian national movement during the Weltkrieg as a writer for the important nationalist paper Naša Niva, meeting brothers Ivan and Anton Luckievič of the Hramada. While in Petrograd in the winter of 1916, he designed a potential national flag for Belarus, which he never submitted and the white-red-white by Klaŭdzij Duž-Dušeŭski would become the national flag. From 1917 on, he was devoted to the Belarusian national cause, eventually joining the Social-Democrats. In 1918, he was made \"chief architect\" of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR), designing national awards for the government and working on different school-building projects across the country. The next year, he went to Warsaw again, this time as head of the Belarusian consulate, and he would soon become the first ambassador to Poland, helping thaw relations after several years of anxiety from Polish attitudes towards Belarusians.\n\nWhile remaining active in politics and writing profusely for different nationalist papers, Dubiejkaŭski returned to his work in architecture. His work began to slow down in the 1930s, and after 1935, poor health forced him into retirement.\n\nThe long life of this illustrious Belarusian leaves behind a legacy that will live on with the nation, cemented in stone and concrete across the land."

whrmisc.18.d:0 "Today, [WHR.GetNameDef] lost one of its founding fathers, Vasiĺ Ivanavič Zacharka. One of the leaders of the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists, he is to be granted a state funeral with the highest honours as one of the nation's most prominent politician.\n\nBorn in a village near [94.GetName] in 1877, Zacharka became a teacher in 1895. Three years later, he became a cadet in the Russian Army and would serve until 1902, only to be mobilised again in 1904 to serve until 1917 as a junior officer.\n\nBy the time he had been demobilised the first time, he was already a member of the Belarusian Socialist Hramada, and on October 22, 1917, he was one of the organisers of the Congress of Belarusian Soldiers on the Western Front, soon becoming secretary of the Central Military Council. As a participant in the All-Belarusian Congress, he was briefly imprisoned by the Bolsheviks before being freed when the German Army occupied Minsk, and he began collaborating with the Germans afterwards. From February 1918, he was a member of the government of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR), serving in different treasurer and other roles in finances, even briefly as People's Minister of Finance. After 1919, he requested to be transferred out of the People's Ministry of Finance into the fledgling diplomatic service instead. In June, he was sent to Berlin, heading the BNR's diplomatic mission to the German Emperor. When Germany transformed our state into a Monarchy after the Russian Civil War, his mission was upgraded to an embassy, becoming the first ambassador to the German Empire.\n\nZacharka remained in Berlin until December 1925 when he returned to Minsk. Returning home, our first King would appoint him and his newly founded BNP as head of government, in spite of the social-democratic dominated Rada. \n\nThe esteemed leader leaves behind a respectable political career and the massive government archives that he has been working on for almost two decades. He will be remembered as one of the founding fathers of our nation, helping the country earn recognition from the rest of the world."

Brothers Waldemar and Žyhimont, formally the Royal Family to our nation, arrived in Minsk the other day before embarking on a tour of the country tailored to their interests.\n\nUpon their arrival, they were greeted by the expected military parade, where Waldemar quietly inspected the details on the uniforms of the soldiers of the People's Army. As avid automotive enthusiasts, the royals visited the burgeoning Minsk Automobile Plant, impressed by the ability of the small nation of White Ruthenia to even produce cars in the first place considering the state of the nation when they left. The visit concluded with a ball at the National Theatre, bringing together the majority of the region's notable figures of high society.\n\nThe publicity stunt proved to be successful as it went without incidents and was presented positively in the German press, helping raise awareness and improve our image abroad. A few days later, [GetLeader] received a letter and package from former King Waldemar: It contained a set of tin toy soldiers made by the ex-King himself, that looked like Belarusian soldiers, with the letter signed \"Uladzimir\", a his former name as King.. Prince Žyhimont's gratitude was felt more indirectly, as the more business-savvy royal returned with more than a few economic opportunities for his friends in German industry, who would happily mention that they had gotten a tip from a certain \"Prince Žyhimont\"."

whrmisc.23.d:0 "The entire series of events started when a Belarusian farmer informed the police of the wreck of an aircraft that had fallen to his fields, in the small village of Svecha, some sixty kilometres west from Vitebsk. When the police arrived to the scene, what was initially thought to be a civilian accident turned out to be a Russian scout plane. The plane was largely burned, and its camera was removed. There was no sight of the pilot, though a manhunt was started in the entire district of Biešankovicki.\n\nWhat was left of the plane was quickly delivered to the Borovka Air Base for further examination. Despite the pilot's attempts to destroy the machine, aviation engineers managed to identify the plane as a little known Kamov gyroplane primarily equipped for aerial photographing. It seemed probable that it had been photographing the important bridge of Svecha, which lies on the route from Vitebsk to Minsk. Evidence of this level of Russian war planning against Germany's eastern allies is alarming on entirely new level, as many have believed that Russia would not dare to try their luck with Germany once again. Germany has promised to deploy additional air escadres to Belarus, and the military readiness of the eastern allies has been increased."

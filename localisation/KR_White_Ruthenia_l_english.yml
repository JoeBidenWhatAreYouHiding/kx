### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_USIEVALAD_IHNATOUSKI_DESC: "Usievalad Makaravič Ihnatoŭski began his political career as a member of the Russian Socialist-Revolutionary Party in 1902. After getting into trouble with the Tsarist authorities and expelled from the University of Saint Petersburg, he enrolled at the Yurievsky (Dorpat/Tartu) University, graduating in 1911 before working as a teacher at the Minsk Pedagogical Institute. He would work there until 1921, and for most of the Weltkrieg, he appeared loyal to the government despite his rebellious past. Nevertheless, by 1917, he was the head of an organisation called Young Belarus, becoming a member of the Belarusian Socialist Hramada. When the Hramada split in 1918, he joined the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, opposing the government of the Belarusian People's Republic's pro-German stance. However, he also grew disillusioned by the BPS-R's anti-Bolshevik stance.\n\nWhen BPS-R co-founder Tamaš Hryb called for cooperation with the puppet monarchy of the Germans, Ihnatoŭski led a split from the BPS-R, forming the underground Belarusian Revolutionary Organisation. While he became a member of the Belarusian Institute of Culture, later the Academy of Sciences, he made contacts with émigrés in Paris and the Third International. Now that the World Revolution has reached Belarus, Ihnatoŭski and his cadre of revolutionaries are at the helm of the Belarusian Workers' Socialist Republic, implementing an authoritarian left-populist program to bring socialism to his native land."
POLITICS_TAMAS_HRYB_DESC: "The co-founder of the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries was born from a poor peasant family. Before the Weltkrieg, he worked at the Baltic Shipyard in Saint Petersburg and became involved in Belarusian literary circles in the city. In 1914, he was drafted into the Russian Army and remained in service until 1917. He was elected to the All-Belarusian Congress in December 1917 as one of several representatives of Belarusian soldiers fighting on the Romanian Front, and was arrested by Bolshevik authorities when it was suppressed. When he was freed, he became involved in the creation of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR) as a member of the Rada (Council) of the BNR and the Central Military Council. He and the BPS-R became outspoken supporters of complete independence for Belarus, but they could not convince the Rada to change their pro-German orientation. He would be imprisoned twice in 1919 by German authorities for actively opposing the occupation and only released when the BNR was officially recognised by Germany in 1920.\n\nAs it became clear that the German presence could not be opposed any longer, Hryb called for the BPS-R to work with other leftist parties in the newly-established Rada, causing a minor split in the party. From 1925 onward, the BPS-R maintained a presence within the successive Social-Democratic governments, representing the Peasants' and Workers' Hramada's radical wing.\n\nHryb would remain suspected by German authorities the whole time, and he remained careful about any affiliation with the Third International, even if his sympathies were an open secret. With the World Revolution having spread to Belarus, however, there is no longer any reason to hold back as the BPS-R begins work at implementing their full left-populist program, with their co-founder at the head of the Belarusian Workers' Socialist Republic."
POLITICS_BRANISLAU_TARASKIEVIC_DESC: "Coming from a peasant family of modest means, Branisłaŭ Adamavič Taraškievič became involved in the Belarusian national movement during his studies in Vilnius. In 1911, he continued his education in Saint Petersburg, where he became acquainted with the nationalist poet Janka Kupala. Because of his excellent grades, he was easily admitted into the Faculty of History and Philology of Saint Petersburg University, where he studied under numerous accomplished linguists. He returned to Minsk in 1917, deeply involved with the Belarusian Socialist Hramada and the foundation of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR) the following year. When the Hramada split in 1918, he found himself on the side of the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party, which pursued a pragmatically pro-German path, rejected Soviet Russia and its degeneration into \"bureaucratic socialism\", and wished to create a free democratic socialist state through reforms.\n\nAfter serving in the People's Ministry of Education, Taraškievič quickly rose up the BSDP's central committee. With the fall of the Monarchy, Taraškievič stands as head of the BSDP and now Belarus itself, wishing to see the Republic transformed into a true socialist paradise."

As such, it was no surprise that when the opportunity presented itself, he and the Hramada defected to the Third Internationale, working with them to continue their work towards a democratic and socialist Belarusian People's Republic."
POLITICS_MIKOLA_ABRAMCIK_DESC: "When the Belarusian People's Republic declared its independence, Mikola Abramčyk was only fourteen years old, but he was soon involved in national politics in 1921 as a representative from Vileyka, but continued his education in 1924 at the Belarusian State University. As an active member of the Association of Belarusian Student Organisations, Abramčyk became a member of the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists as a close associate and protégé of Vasil Zacharka. After earning a degree in engineering and economics, he was involved in the All-Belarusian Congress of Trade Unions while further splitting his time with prolific writing and reading. After 1930, he was involved with Belarusian migrant workers in Germany and, in 1932, he founded the Union of Belarusian Emigrant Workers and published the Bulletin of Belarusian Workers in Germany. There, he made his anti-communard sentiments very clear and made sure to limit the influence of the Third International within the Belarusian labour movement.\n\nWhile a relatively young face in Belarusian politics, few can deny his activity within the Belarusian national and labour movements as a writer, teacher, and politician. What is certain is that he is likely to have a very long political career."
POLITICS_ADAM_STANKIEVIC_DESC: "Hailing for Vilnius, Adam Vikienćjevič Stankievič was ordained a Catholic priest in 1914. During his studies at the Petrograd Roman Catholic Theological Academy, he became a member of the Belarusian Circle, a group of Belarusian Catholic students there, and he would become one of the founders of Belarusian Christian Democracy (BKhD) in 1917. He became one of the leaders of the Belarusian community in Lithuania, becoming widely respected for his tireless charity work.\n\nAt the 4th Congress of the BKhD in December 1931, he was elected member of its central committee and became involved in politics in White Ruthenia. There, he helped strengthen the National-Democratic Association as Christian Democracy gained a stronger voterbase, working with the informal Orthodox wing of the movement, the Peasants' Union (not to be confused with the Peasant Party), presenting an increasingly valid opposition to the political hegemony of the Hramada.\n\n.In a way, this is a victory for Belarusian democracy as a proof of its health, and Stankievič played a key part. It appears that the esteemed priest will be leading the Belarusian people towards further prosperity with his dedication to humanitarianism and the well-being of his people."
POLITICS_RADASLAU_ASTROUSKI_DESC: "Radasłaŭ Kazimiravič Astroŭski is no stranger to revolution, having participated in the 1905 Revolution, getting arrested in 1911 for revolutionary unrest, and serving the Russian Provisional Government after the February Revolution of 1917. Like many early Belarusian nationalists, he worked to secure his nation's autonomy within the Russian Republic, but loudly decried the October Revolution and became an early proponent for the independence of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR) as a delegate to the All-Belarusian Congress of December 1917.\n\nAfter volunteering for military service after the creation of the Belarusian People's Army, he worked for the People's Ministry of Education for most of the 20s, joining the Peasants' and Workers' Hramada. During this time, while initially seeming to drift towards the left-wing of the bloc, he soon found himself alienated as it grew closer to the rhetoric of the Third Internationale. By 1936, his views had shifted dramatically and he had become an outspoken member of the bloc's right-wing, criticising the growth of Syndicalist influence within the Hramada as dangerous and foreign.\n\nNow, his time in the Hramada has become irrelevant as they refused to heed his warnings. After coming into conflict with the chairman of the Hramada, Branisłaŭ Taraškievič, Astroŭski began to work against them behind the scenes, knowing that the BSDP wouldn't be dislodged by legal means, organising the group of dissident politicians and army officers that would become the Belarusian Central Rada after overthrowing the Taraškievič government. While the coup had mixed results, it has become clear that the Hramada is no longer a threat to the nation, saved from a dangerous Syndicalist plot. It remains to be seen whether the Chairman of the Central Rada can truly bring order and stability to White Ruthenia."
POLITICS_VACLAU_LASTOUSKI_DESC: "Vacłaŭ Justynavič Łastoŭski is one of the most prominent Belarusian nationalists and a long-time member of the Belarusian national movement. His involvement reaches back to 1906 when he first joined the Belarusian Socialist Hramada and was editor of the association's newspaper \"Nasha Niva\" until 1914. He was a prolific author and historian, managing the Belarusian Publishing Society since its founding in 1915, actively contributing to the cultural and national development of Belarus. As an outspoken supporter of Belarusian independence, he was a member of the Belarusian Council in Vilnius and joined the Rada of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR). As part of the Rada, he supported the BNR's declaration of independence before, as a vocal supporter of close Lithuanian-Belarusian relations, representing Belarusian interests in the Lithuanian diplomatic mission in Berlin.\n\nIn 1919, Łastoŭski joined the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, but would quickly come into conflict over foreign policy and tactics with its central committee and would split with them the next year. He would then support the government's pro-German orientation after joining Viačaslaŭ Adamovič's Belarusian Peasant Party (Green Oak) and would become a key member of the Belarusian Institute of Culture, Inbelcult, after its foundation in 1922, and later in 1928 when it was transformed into the Belarusian Academy of Sciences. \n\nBy 1936, Łastoŭski had become the head of Green Oak's political wing and its chief ideologue. Despite his early involvement with socialists, he had always been critical of Marxism and class warfare, and always put national interests over class. More importantly, he consistently denied the idea of any kind of Russian-Belarusian unity, seeking to deepen ties with the Baltic nations instead and to purge as much Russian influence as possible. His anti-Russian sentiments bled into his writings, considering the \"Muscovite\" people as Mongol, while Belarusians, as the descendants of the medieval Kryvich tribe, were the \"true Slavs\" and even part of the Aryan race. In his goal to purge all Russian influences, he believes the Belarusian nation and identity should be renamed to match their ancestors: Kryvian.\n\nWith a revanchist Russian state to the east, it certainly does appear that the Kryvian people will be fighting for its very survival, and it will be a bloody battle."
POLITICS_WERNER_KEMPF_DESC: "Werner Kempf is neither a friend or foe of the Belarusians. He is a Prussian officer through and through, and his objective is simply: Prepare White Ruthenia for an invasion from the East. As much of the country must be mobilised for the war effort as possible before it is too late, else the Russians will punch through a weak link in the Ostwall and pour west between Polesia and the Baltic. Kempf has no concern for the people there; the Central Rada can handle internal affairs, and his priority is the military situation, and he expects the White Ruthenians to cooperate as much as possible. After all, their survival depends on the German Army; neither they nor he can afford to lose."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_DESC: "The king of White Ruthenia Uladzimir von Hohenzollern is not the kind of man one expects for such a job. Born Waldemar Wilhelm Ludwig Friedrich Viktor Heinrich von Hohenzollern, son of Prince Heinrich of Prussia, nephew of the Kaiser, nothing destined him to become king of White Ruthenia, at least until the German victory in the Weltkrieg. After the abolition of the Belarusian People's Republic, Uladzimir's father became the king of the country, he did his best to fight against illiteracy and tried to modernize the country during his reign, he died on April 20, 1929 with his son ascending to his throne.\n\nUladzimir is generally seen as a weak monarch, although loving his people, he is considered a man with little experience in governmental matters. With a reputation as a cowardly and indecisive man, his many bouts of hemophilia only make his situation worse and prevent him from making efforts for his country. One would think that this situation would lead to the BSDP-dominated Duma taking the lead in the political process, but this is not the case, as much of the executive power is held by the pro-German PNP Prime Minister Vasyl Zacharka at the expense of the King. With popular discontent on the rise, calls for a return to democracy and even the establishment of a republic increasing, socialists lurking in the shadows and his brother eyeing the throne greedily, the King's position is increasingly precarious.\n\nUladzimir knows that he will have to act sooner or later in some way, one can only wonder how."
POLITICS_SIGISMUND_DESC: "" #to rewrite later
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_MONBOL_DESC: "Uladzimir, King of the People's Kingdom of White Ruthenia, the Monarch of the Proletariat, the Protector of the Peasants, so many extravagant titles are attributed to him, yet the reality is known to all, the King is only a pawn of the KBP.  Uladzimir tried to do his best, to start a process of democratization of his country in order to give the power back to the people and the Duma, conscientiously reducing his power himself, loving his people, he gave them the gift of democracy. The people did not fail to express themselves in the elections, but the results shocked many, as the socialists, whom Uladzimir had previously re-legalized, won the election. The king and many expected the monarchy to be abolished as soon as possible by the new government, while the king, exhausted and plagued by frequent hemophilia attacks, had already planned to return to Germany, but this was not to be.\n\nWith the main purpose of preventing an aggression of the Reichpakt, the socialists decided to proclaim the People's Kingdom of White Ruthenia, a Bolshevik monarchy, a first in history, while keeping Uladzimir, nephew of the Kaiser, nominally at its head. In reality, the People's King does not spend his days governing anything, not having the power to do so, but only signing any document brought to his office by the KBP men. Uladzimir feels broken and humiliated, surrounded by men who keep him in power only by necessity, hating him and mocking him behind his back.\n\nSometimes he wonders during these long days of 'governance' if he should have listened to his brother before it was too late."

### Events ###
whrpol.1.t: "[ROOT.GetName] - Starting Situation"
whrpol.1.d: "The troubled birth of the [WHR.GetNameDef] took place in the backdrop of the Weltkrieg and the Russian Civil War. When the German Army entered Minsk in February 1918, they were largely unaware of the peoples that lived in the region, assuming the East Slavic people there were merely Russians under an old Polish aristocracy. In the immediate aftermath of the Brest-Litovsk treaty and withdrawal of the Russian troops from Belarus, the All-Belarusian Congress declared the formation of the Belarusian People's Republic catching even Germany by surprise. In their defence, the Belarusian National Revival had only begun in the 1890s and was largely restricted to a small, but growing, urban intelligentsia, and the first Belarusian political party, the Belarusian Socialist Assembly, commonly called the Hramada, was only founded in 1903.\n\nNevertheless, the Germans were quick to exploit the unfolding situation as they steadily delegated powers to the Belarusian National Council, or Rada, from 1918 onwards. Having witnessed the Bolsheviks forcefully disband the All-Belarusian Congress merely two months before their arrival, the German Army saw a way to weaken Russian, and therefore Bolshevik, power in the region, and limit Polish influence in Eastern Europe by supporting the creation of a White Ruthenian state, albeit under close German supervision.\n\nThe independence of [WHR.GetNameDef] would be recognised through the Treaty of Minsk in 1920, although its borders were far smaller than the Rada had hoped as the Germans favoured a more defensible border on the Dnieper and Dvina. While this was met with disappointment by Belarusian nationalists, they had no way to press their claims. Nevertheless, it curbed the BNR's ambitions to a more manageable area, for it was clear to even the staunchest nationalist that Belarusian national identity was weak and the Republic had limited popular support.\n\nIn late 1920, the Rada ceded its powers to the promised Constituent Assembly, which adopted a constitution and held elections to the Rada, the parliament of the People's Republic."
whrpol.1.a: "The future looked bright for Belarus, but clouds are gathering on the horizon."

whrpol.intro.t: "[ROOT.GetName] - Starting Situation"
whrpol.intro.d: "However, the young republic faced two problems at once in the face of Germany and the troops it deployed on the territory of Belarus, and the Socialists who won the elections to the constituent Assembly.\n\nThe Belarussian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, inspired by their counterparts in Russia, had won a landslide majority in the Assembly and immediately demanded socialization of land, power to the peasant councils and other \"unauthorized\" slogans – a move, which was regarded by the Kaiserreich as a provocation. In merely one month the Constituent Assembly was dissolved and a pro-German government was installed instead. The powerful German Empire demanded reformation of the state into a Prussian-style semi-constitutional monarchy, with Wilhelm II’s brother Heinrich as King. Not wishing to suffer the same fate as the BPSR, now dominant in the Rada, the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party agreed, handing the crown to Heinrich, taking the regal name Genrykh. The White Ruthenian government under Genrykh’s supervision began a programme of land reform and education programs, both doomed to end in failure. Illiteracy remained mostly endemic, not helped by the inability of Belarusian nationalists to decide between a Latin or Cyrillic script for their revival of the Belarusian language. After Heinrich's death, his son Waldemar ascended to the throne as Uladzimir I. Plagued with the recurring effects of haemophilia and not trained to any reasonable level in statecraft, Uladzimir has proven ineffective in giving the country the rule it so desperately needs.\n\n A powerless Rada acts as the sole way for the people to voice their opinion, which is often ignored by the King, despite the declared 'coalition government' with the Right Hramadist BPS-F and Christian Democrats. What's more, the political status quo is currently being disturbed by the machinations of Uladzimir's brother and head of the NBP secret police Žyhimont, a figure that sees himself as the rightful heir to the throne. The controversial Prince has made contact with some politicians in the Belarusian Independent Party (BNP) in his barely concealed plotting to seize the throne from his Germanophile brother. With three factions all just waiting for their chance to size power in Belarus, the future seems bleak indeed."
whrpol.intro.a: "Žyćcio Karaleustva svajgo!"

whrpol.2.t: "The Necessity of Reform"
whrpol.2.d: "The Social-Democrats take great pride in their victory against the conservatives. However, one of the main concerns in the mind of Belarusians during the foundation of the People's Republic, and later the Kingdom, was land reform. Belarusians were, for the most part, merely landless peasants, and most of the land was owned by Polish or, to a smaller extent, Russian aristocrats, which was seen as the greatest impediment to Belarusian nation-building and economic prosperity. Nowadays, most of the land is finally in the hands of Belarusian smallholders, but there are still many landless peasants and many hectares of land owned by \"foreign\" aristocrats or one of the two churches in the country. For many, it is clear that Plan Sierada, the informal name of the land reform program long proposed by the Minister of Agriculture has much work to do. Many have grown frustrated by the lack of progress as the Ministry of Agriculture quickly runs out of funds as they compensate former landowners during the ownership transfer.\n\nWhile the majority of the BSDP insists that progress has been steady, there is growing internal opposition not only within the Hramada, but the leading party itself. As the party internally debates how to help finalise the Plan, it remains to be seen whether they will decide on an increased budget or something far more radical as many within the party are calling for with increasing support."
whrpol.2.a: "Smallholding is the future of land ownership."

whrpol.3.t: "The Sierada Report"
whrpol.3.d: "The need for land reform in Belarus has been recognised for decades. The landowning class in the country has been overwhelmingly Polish or Russian, with the former having by far the biggest share, while the majority of ethnic Belarusians were peasants, few of them owning the land they worked. This led to considerable class tensions up to the Weltkrieg, especially as the national consciousness of the Belarusian people began to grow in the lead-up to the Weltkrieg. As such, as a way to cement the creation of Belarusian national identity, uplift the peasantry from crippling poverty, and weaken the power of the landed gentry, land reform has been part of the political programs of most political parties.\n\nHowever, it would prove easier said than done. While the radical left (and, increasingly, the radical right as well) has long preached for the seizure and redistribution of land by the government, the monarchy refused, save in a few token cases. As such, Plan Sierada, named after the recently appointed Minister for Agriculture from the Hramada, behind it, has much to work towards.\n\nIn his report, Jan Sierada has highlighted the land reform's projected successes, especially in its first year. Sierada concludes that the land reform program can be completed before 1939, earlier with extra funding, while emphasising that compensation to landowners has had a net positive effect as they invested in different economic sectors."
whrpol.3.a: "Peasants are the backbone of our nation."

whrpol.4.t: "Congress of the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union"
whrpol.4.d: "With the collapse of the German economy fresh in their minds, the delegates from the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party, the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists, and the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries have assembled to discuss the future of Plan Sierada. The Socialist-Revolutionaries have long criticised the plan as reactionary and far too forgiving to the \"foreign\" landowners. Compensating for all the lands redistributed has been a massive state expense which the budget has struggled to handle, with cuts largely responsible for the Plan's slowed progress. The left-wing of the BSDP, informally led by Prime Minister Symon Rak-Mihailovski, have taken the same position as the BPS-R, and even President Taraškievič has begun to consider a radical change of plans.\n\nJan Sierada, People's Minister for Agriculture and a member of the BPS-F, has tirelessly defended his Plan both within the Hramada and at the Rada, and believes a budget increase will be more than enough to get it back on track. Informal leader of the BSDP's right-wing, Anton Lutskevich, has warned that a radical course would alienate their German ally, already cautious of the Hramada's open socialist leaning, and fears that they would support reactionary elements in the People's Army and Rada against them should they adopt a dangerous \"Bolshevik\" plan.\n\nThe future direction of the Hramada belongs to centrists of the BSDP, who will tip the favour between Sierada's moderate proposal, or succumb to the Socialist-Revolutionary's pressure and their populist rhetoric."
whrpol.4.a: "The BSDP leadership resists radical pressure."
whrpol.4.b: "No more compensation for landowners!"

whrpol.5.t: "Illiteracy"
whrpol.5.d: "The Belarusian lands have struggled with abysmal literacy rates ranging from 10 to 20% in the census of 1897, putting the nation at a serious disadvantage in their efforts to create a Belarusian nation. It wouldn't be until 1918, under the direction of the BNR Rada and with German support did the literacy rate of the country begin to improve through the manifold expansion of the school system. In 1926, the Ministry of Education reported a 36% literacy rate that year, and this year it was approaching the 50% milestone. Despite the clear progress, illiteracy remains a clear impediment to our nation's development culturally, economically, and scientifically."
whrpol.5.a: "Just build more schools, fool!"
whrpol.6.t: "Rada in Deadlock"
whrpol.6.d: "Angered by the government's handling of Plan Sierada, the opposition in the Rada, members of either the BNP or Lastouski's Kryvian Party, have teamed up with dissidents within the Hramada to delay further legislation. While the opposition on its own is too weak to topple the government and call for elections, their delays created a tense situation in parliament. As the session was adjourned yesterday, numerous insults had been thrown around, and there were rumours that both the BSDP and the Hramada was on the verge of collapse while many people in Minsk have witnessed increased activity at the House of the People's Army and the German embassy."
whrpol.6.a: "Things will settle down soon enough, right?"

whrpol.7.t: "The Coup"
whrpol.7.d: "Many of Minsk's residents woke up this morning to soldiers patrolling the streets, ordering people to stay home. In front of Government House, where Rada sessions are held, an armoured car and a platoon of soldiers watch over Independence Square, while the capital's radio stations were also occupied and interrupted regular transmission. Later in the morning, the First National Station broadcast a message by Radasłaŭ Astroŭski. [WHR.GetLeader]'s government had been deposed by the army for collusion with \"foreign, syndicalist elements\", planning to subvert the deadlocked Rada through a revolution. Furthermore, he announced that the government was replaced by a new temporary authority, the Belarusian Council of Ministers, or Rada Ministrav. After the composition of the Rada was declared, he ended the message by issuing the order to arrest [WHR.GetLeader] and other members of the former government for high treason.\n\nWhile all roads going in and out of Minsk had military checkpoints by noon, it was clear that all members of the former government had avoided arrest and had fled the city. [ROOT.GetName] appeared on the path of civil war."
whrpol.7.a: "We must save Belarus from syndicalism!"

whrpol.8.t: "The Rump Rada"
whrpol.8.d: "Chairman Astrouski has found himself in an uncomfortable position. Practically no fellow members of the BSDP have accepted his call for support and national unity against the syndicalist threat despite having assured his army backers that he would rally at least the right-wing of the party behind him. At this point, his Central Rada is proving to be an embarrassing failure.\n\nThis situation has driven Astrouski to approach other parties in the Rada, which has, thus far, not been recalled since the start of the coup. Specifically, Astrouski is hoping to gain the support of the National Democratic Association consisting of Raman Skirmunt's People's Party and Adam Stankievič's Christian Democrats. With their support, the Central Rada would gain the legitimacy it needs to function as the Hramada has entered a state of open revolt in the countryside.\n\nIn meeting with its leaders, Chairman Astrouski offered key positions to National Democrats within the Central Rada and promised the restoration of the Rada as soon as possible- excluding \"treasonous\" Hramada members, of course- in exchange for support for a new constitution and aid against \"syndicalist rebels\". The Christian Democrats are particularly reluctant to cooperate, seeing the coup as illegitimate and a terrible legal precedent, but their concerns over letting the military rule alone or, perhaps worse, letting Lastouski's Kryvians gain power, may convince them to side with the Central Rada."
whrpol.8.a: "The NDA support the Central Rada."
whrpol.8.b: "Astrouski fails to gain their support."

whrpol.9.t: "Rada Passes New Budget"
whrpol.9.d: "As agreed through the latest Hramada congress, the People's Minister of Agriculture, Jan Sierada, presented a new, expanded budget for the stalled land reform program. With the lukewarm support of the left secured at the congress, the bill passed with relative ease as it was supported by the National Democratic Association. Opposition to the bill was largely left to the Kryvians that argued, as the left-wing had within the Hramada before them, it was still too lenient towards landowners. However, their opposition proved fairly weak, and Lastouski, leader of the Kryvians, acquiesced that the new bill would help support peasants threatened by Germany's economic crisis.\n\nLeftist papers \"Bielaruskaja Dumka\" was mildly critical of the BPS-R's support of the bill, reserving their harsh judgement on Lastouski, himself a former member of that party until 1920. In their opinion, Lastouski's opposition to the bill was disingenuous and merely a ploy to co-opt leftists to his reactionary movement. Lastouski himself, though his paper \"Kryvich\", was quick to retort, accusing the BPS-R of abandoning their core support base and continuing to \"sell out\" to internationalism instead of helping develop the Belarusian-Kryvian nation.\n\nEither way, it appears the radicals on both sides are wasting their venom on each other, letting us focus on work that will actually benefit the people."
whrpol.9.a: "Let them bicker; the people await action, not words."

whrpol.10.t: "Battle of Borisov"
whrpol.10.d: "Seventy-four kilometres north-east of Minsk, on the banks of the Berezina river, lay the city of Borisov, one of the largest in the region except Minsk. In order to secure the region around the capital, Borisov had to be secured, and the People's Army marched in for that purpose. There was little resistance from syndicalist rebels and the city was secured within a day."
whrpol.10.a: "The capital is now safe."

whrpol.11.t: "Battle of [1087.GetName]"
whrpol.11.d: "[1087.GetName], by the Russian border, is one of the most important and industrialised cities in [ROOT.GetNameDef]. As expected, syndicalist resistance there was fierce. Nevertheless, our troops successfully secured the city once the steel mill and the automobile plant were secured. Enemy partisans have fled to the countryside, but it will be a matter of time before they are mopped up."
whrpol.11.a: "Another key city secured."

whrpol.12.t: "Battle of [207.GetName]"
whrpol.12.d: "[207.GetName] and its lakes lay in the northern corner of the country and, other than securing border crossings, is rather unremarkable. The army encountered little resistance in the province, and the northern border crossings will block a potential escape route into Lithuania for syndicalists."
whrpol.12.a: "The troops are now enjoying the lakeside beaches."

whrpol.13.t: "Battle of [95.GetName]"
whrpol.13.d: "The city of [95.GetName] rests at an important location at the confluence of the Pripyat and Pina rivers. The region is known for its marshes and is not only very difficult for armies to pass, but a prime location for partisans. As expected, with the city itself a stronghold of the BSDP and the Jewish Bund, resistance was particularly fierce. Once the city was secured, numerous excesses from our troops have been reported as they took out their anger at the majority-Jewish population. Punishments were quickly dealt once discipline was restored, but it is now clear that underlying ethnic tensions have reached a breaking point."
whrpol.13.a: "We must limit violence against civilians!"

whrpol.14.t: "Battle of [204.GetName]"
whrpol.14.d: "The region around [204.GetName] contains some of the few industries in the country. As expected, the syndicalists put up fierce resistance around factories and public buildings. Nevertheless, our troops eventually overpowered them and the rebels fled west, presumably into the countryside or Lithuania. Now, however, many important border crossings are in our hands, which should limit the ability for rebels to flee the country."
whrpol.14.a: "Another key region in our hands."

whrpol.15.t: "Battle of [194.GetName]"
whrpol.15.d: "The region around [194.GetName] has seen rapid economic development in recent history, containing a number of food-processing and salt extraction plants. Once our troops secured the factories, the syndicalist rebels melted into the countryside, with some presumably fleeing into Ukraine."
whrpol.15.a: "The south is secured."

whrpol.16.t: "Approaching the Bundist Moderates"
whrpol.16.d: "Our relationship with the Jewish Labour Bund has always been symbiotic, that said, the leadership of the Bund is afraid of sweeping changes to the existing status quo, changes that we intend to initiate. That said, the younger members of the Bund have grown up during the official political partnership between us and the Bund and as a result, are much more receptive to us and our reforms. So, to gain the support of the Bund, we intend to give our full support and endorsement to these younger moderate members of the Bund, in hopes that they'll gain more influence within the Bund and eventually take it over, ensuring a more friendly Bund as we implement our many reforms."
whrpol.16.a: "Best of luck to these young moderates!"

whrpol.17.t: "Moderates take over the Bund"
whrpol.17.d: "Our gamble has paid off, under the risk of jeopardising our partnership with the Jewish Labour Bund, we endorsed an effort by young moderate members of the Bund to take over the leadership from the Old Guard. These moderates are much more closely aligned to our government and have proven to be more receptive to our ideas of reform. That said, the chaos within the Bund has undermined the work lives of many Jewish workers, though we believe that things should return to normal given enough time."
whrpol.17.a: "Excellent"

whrpol.18.t: "Negotiating with the Bund Leadership"
whrpol.18.d: "The support and aid of the Jewish Labour Bund are instrumental to our hegemony over the Rada and by extension the stability of the government, so the consensus goes that we have to reach a compromise with the Bund leadership in order to gain their support for our economics reforms and reinforce our partnership."
whrpol.18.a: "Hopefully it all goes well..."

whrpol.19.t: "The Bund Puts Forward Demands"
whrpol.19.d: "The Bund, realising that they have the upper hand in the negotiations, have put forward several demands, while most are minor and can be met with no issue, one other demand has stuck out like a sore thumb upon review by the Rada, a demand of Bundist "autonomy" within the economy, in other words, that we should exempt Bundist workers from the harshest government regulations. This caused an uproar on the left and right, with the right accusing the Jews of making the government their puppet while the left accuses the government of prioritising one labour organisation over the others. That said, we are not in the position to abandon negotiations, as doing that will practically destroy our partnership with the Bund and severely endanger our ability to govern the Rada."
whrpol.19.a: "Outrageous, but we can't end negotiations"

whrpol.20.t: "Negotiations with the Bund are a Success!"
whrpol.20.d: "What was thought to be an impossible task has become a success! Our representatives report that we have reached a conclusive agreement with the leadership of the Jewish Labour Bund regarding their support for our many reforms, while submitting to the Bund's demands was a hard pill to swallow for some, the benefits cannot be denied, as we have essentially re-enforced our alliance with the Bund going forward and their support for the government is guaranteed."
whrpol.20.a: "Glad to have the Bund's support!"

whrpol.21.t: "Kryvians Unrest in Minsk"
whrpol.21.d: "With Chairman Astrouski failing to gather support from the rest of the Rada, Lastouski's Kryvians, forming the third bloc in the Rada, have suddenly increased their activities in Minsk. Particularly, the Union of Belarusian Youth has led numerous demonstrations across the cities and in other urban areas of the country in opposition to the coup. Lastouski himself has been gathering support from the Belarusian Scientific Society and the Academy of Sciences with the disappearance of many BSDP members of those organisations. Perhaps more worryingly, it appears that the army's support for Astrouski has already waned considerably and there are rumours they are willing to support the charismatic Lastouski instead, apparently under pressure from the German embassy."
whrpol.21.a: "This is bad!"

whrpol.22.t: "Lastouski's Putsch"
whrpol.22.d: "With support for the Central Rada collapsing, Lastouski made his move. Leading a procession of supporters and members of the Union of Belarusian Youth, the head of the Kryvian movement marched into Government House in Minsk, with soldiers letting the marchers in without any resistance. With the army and the Germans abandoned him, Astrouski had already fled the building before Lastouski's arrival, and the Kryvians quickly proclaimed the Central Rada deposed and the formation of a new Council of People's Ministers. Lastouski was proclaimed interim President and Chairman of the Council through a radio address, which included promises to restore the Constitution and the Rada, though it remains to be seen who will be allowed to sit or if elections will be held. What is known is that Lastouski has promised to rid Belarus of its \"Russian-hypnosis\" once and for all and lead the revival of the Belarusian nation into its purest form, as Kryvians."
whrpol.22.a: "Long live the Kryvich State!"

whrpol.23.t: "Astrouski's Government"
whrpol.23.d: "With negotiations with the National Democratic Association successful, Chairman Astrouski has been able to legitimise his Central Rada and ease the worries from the military. A new government has been formed, with support from both the army and the German military mission. It appears it will only be a matter of time before the remnants of the former government will be silenced and resistance in the countryside suppressed."
whrpol.23.a: "[ROOT.GetName] will be free of syndicalism."

whrpol.24.t: "The General Jewish Labour Bund"
whrpol.24.d: "Within the current borders of the Belarus, reside around half a million Jews, with another half a million within its claimed territory. From the revolutionary times of the Weltkrieg and since, the Jewish population of the country has been deeply involved in Belarusian nation-building, and every urban area in the country has a significant, if not majority, Jewish population. Nowadays, the dominant organisation representing Jews and Jewish interests is the General Jewish Labour Bund, or simply Bund.\n\nThe Bund is a progressive organisation heavily inspired by Austrian social-democracy. Their program of Jewish autonomism, inspired by the Austromarxist Personal Principle, hopes to achieve self-rule and cultural autonomy wherever the Diaspora resides without resorting to the creation of a Jewish state. They have been successful in making the Personal Principle enshrined into the Constitution and the adoption of Yiddish as an official language alongside Belarusian, and have been longtime partners of the Social-Democratic Party as part of the Peasants' and Workers' Union. Their opposition within the Jewish community, Labour Zionists and Folkists, have been significantly marginalised since the 1920s.\n\nThe alliance between the BSDP and the Bund has proven to be a powerful force in Belarusian politics. However, despite their best efforts, antisemitism remains rampant in the country, and the rapid growth of the far-right Kryvians has made the Bund uneasy."
whrpol.24.a: "Together against reaction and antisemitism."

whrpol.25.t: "Election of [GetYear]"
whrpol.25.d: "One of the fundamentals of being a democratic state is to hold elections every couple of years to let the people express their opinion on the government and a myriad of issues. This year is no different and the elections of [GetYear] are upon us. While many parties are vying for power across the country, everyone expects the BSDP to be able to smoothly sail to yet another electoral victory."
whrpol.25.a: "The BSDP wins again!"

whrpol.26.t: "Election of [GetYear]"
whrpol.26.d: "One of the fundamentals of being a democratic state is to hold elections every couple of years to let the people express their opinion on the government and a myriad of issues. This year is no different and the elections of [GetYear] are upon us. While many parties are vying for power across the country, the only blocs with a viable chance at victory are the BSDP-led Hramada and the right-wing National Democratic Association, a coalition of Christian democrats and liberals hoping to oust the BSDP led by Adam Stankievic and Raman Skirmunt. The polls have closed and the winner is..."
whrpol.26.a: "The BSDP wins yet again!"
whrpol.26.c: "BPS-F victory!"
whrpol.26.b: "The NDA pulls an upset!"
whrpol.26.e: "Non-Partisan solid victory."
whrpol.26.f: "Astroŭski's BNP majority!"

whrpol.27.t: "Elections Postponed"
whrpol.27.d: "With our country at war, the elections that were supposed to be held today have been postponed until further notice. The government has promised to hold the elections at the first opportunity after this national emergency has been dealt with."
whrpol.27.a: "Sad, but understandable."

whrpol.28.t: "Kanstancin Jezavitau Defects"
whrpol.28.d: "General Jezavitau, the highest-ranking officer of the People's Army since the death of Kipryjan Kandratovič in 1932, has defected to the Hramadist rebels. As he was a long-time member of the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists, the moderates of the Hramada, this doesn't come as a surprise, but our inability to arrest him or convince him to stay loyal has deeply hurt the credibility of the newly-founded Central Rada. This event was not ignored by the German military mission, whose leader, Werner Kempf, has openly threatened Astrouski that if he doesn't restore control of the situation soon, then the German Army would do it instead and take direct control of all military affairs in the country."
whrpol.28.a: "Bloody socialist."

whrpol.29.t: "Werner Kempf Takes Control"
whrpol.29.d: "As the Central Rada failed to defeat the rebels on their own, the German military mission began their own \"anti-partisan operation\" in [ROOT.GetNameDef]. In the process, however, they have taken direct control of all military forces and affairs in the country, with Werner Kempf becoming the virtual military dictator over the country with the creation of the Generalgouvernement Minsk. Astrouski's Central Rada maintains control of civilian affairs but has effectively become subordinate to Governor-General Kempf. This is a serious humiliation and [ROOT.GetNameDef] has lost significant sovereignty in the process."
whrpol.29.a: "Are we truly that useless without Germany...?"

whrpol.30.t: "Government Flees to Lithuania"
whrpol.30.d: "With most of the country under enemy occupation, the government of [WHR.GetNameDef] have fled to the city of [GetGrodnoName] under friendly Lithuanian hands. The city has a significant Belarusian population and the government hopes that, with Lithuanian and German help, they can continue the fight from there until the country can be liberated. As it seems, the fates of Lithuanians and Belarusians are once again intertwined."
whrpol.30.a: "This feels familiar somehow."

whrpol.31.t: "[WHR.GetAdjective] Government Flees to [GetGrodnoName]"
whrpol.31.d: "With most of the country under enemy occupation, the government of [WHR.GetNameDef] have fled to the city of [GetGrodnoName] under friendly Lithuanian hands. The city has a significant Belarusian population and the government hopes that, with Lithuanian and German help, they can continue the fight from there until the country can be liberated. As it seems, the fates of Lithuanians and Belarusians are once again intertwined."
whrpol.31.a: "Together, we will repel the invaders."

whrpol.32.t: "A Lithuanian-Belarusian Federation?"
whrpol.32.d: "The invasion of our lands and our exile in Lithuania has only proven one thing: We cannot defend our country alone. The Lithuanian government has decided to revive an old proposal: A federation of our two nations, just as it was before the partitions of the Commonwealth. The idea had been briefly revived during the Weltkrieg, but was ultimately shelved from lack of interest in the governments of Lithuania, Belarus, and Germany. Perhaps now is the time to consolidate our efforts in order to better defend ourselves from invaders, but many decry the idea that we are trading our independence for security."
whrpol.32.a: "Only together can we find peace."
whrpol.32.b: "We can never give up our independence."

whrpol.33.t: "Lithuania and [WHR.GetNameDef] Seek Unification"
whrpol.33.d: "With the [WHR.GetAdjective] government ousted by invaders, they and the Lithuanian governments are considering an old idea: A federation of their two nations. The idea had been briefly revived during the Weltkrieg but was ultimately shelved from lack of interest. Now that everyone involved is very aware that the [WHR.GetAdjective] government cannot stand on its own, the idea is being considered once again. As the protector of both nations, we have the final say in the matter: Allow them to unify and form a more cohesive defence of our eastern frontier, or keep them divided and weak so that they cannot possibly threaten our regional hegemony in the future."
whrpol.33.a: "Consolidating them will ease defence matters."
whrpol.33.b: "They must remain divided."

whrpol.34.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Federation Proposal"
whrpol.34.d: "Just like during the Weltkrieg, the idea of a Lithuanian-Belarusian Federation has been rejected. The project will be shelved once more."
whrpol.34.a: "Shame."

whrpol.35.t: "Formation of the Lithuanian-Belarusian Federation"
whrpol.35.d: "With the [WHR.GetAdjective] and German governments in agreement, we have proceeded with the revived plan to unify the two nations that once made up the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Belarusians will, of course, be granted significant autonomy in this arrangement, while the status of Lithuania itself remains unchanged. This will hopefully make us more capable of defending the region from invaders."
whrpol.35.a: "The legacy of the Grand Duchy lives on."

whrpol.36.t: "Łastoŭski's Speech"
whrpol.36.d: "With the Belarusian government exiled to Lithuania as their lands are overrun by our common enemy, Belarusian politician Vacłaŭ Łastoŭski was invited to today's session of the Seimas to speak, with the hope of increasing relations between our two nations.\n\nWhile known as a radical Belarusian nationalist, Łastoŭski clearly has great sympathies towards the Lithuanian nation and, in his speech, repeatedly extolled Lithuania, its people, the shared history and culture of our nations, and, perhaps more importantly, our shared enemies. With his homeland overrun, he called for the Lithuanian nation to carry the mantle of the old Grand Duchy and help towards the liberation of Belarus. Perhaps more surprisingly, he also called for much closer ties, to the point of suggesting a union, in order to avoid Lithuania and Belarus from falling to foreign enemies once more.\n\nHis speech closed with a final cry for unity: \"Long live the brotherly union of Lithuanian and Belarusian Peoples!\""
whrpol.36.a: "The brotherly union, hm?"

whrpol.37.t: "An Offer From Minsk"
whrpol.37.d: "With the [WHR.GetName] breaking free from German dominance, they have found themselves in deep trouble. Without their protector, they are now vulnerable from a counter-attack by our forces. However, an emissary from [WHR.GetNameDef] has arrived with an interesting offer: A peace between our nations.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume, the diplomat argues, that even though they have become diplomatically isolated, he has made it clear that his government are already approaching the Third International for support, seemingly confident that his government, full of sympathisers for Paris and London, can make a convincing appeal to the Syndicalist world now that they have \"broken their chains\" from Berlin. More importantly, he is convinced that further hostilities will only create more unnecessary bloodshed and countless more thousands dead Russians and Belarusians. As such, his government offers not only peace between Belarus and Russia, but also to turn their arms against the Reichspakt, in exchange for the formal transfer of \"rightfully Belarusian\" lands.\n\nWe have little doubt that we can crush them eventually, but the idea that we can avoid having to carve a bloody path to Minsk in exchange of some borderlands is one that we may want to consider, especially if their claims of International support is true. Depending on the situation on the front, however, we may be able to insist on a better deal. The ethnic situation in Krichev and Vitebsk are fairly clear, but much less so in Smolensk, which they also claim. Of course, we can also insist on the pre-war status quo."
whrpol.37.a: "Very well. We can focus on more important fronts this way."
whrpol.37.b: "We can agree with ceding Polotsk and Vitebsk, but Smolensk is Russian!"
whrpol.37.c: "We will only accept the Status Quo Ante Bellum."
whrpol.37.e: "Reject the offer outright."

whrpol.38.t: "The Russian Counter-Offer"
whrpol.38.d_split: "The [RUS.GetName] has taken interest in our offer of a separate peace, but feel that our demands are too extreme. Specifically, they consider the city of Smolensk to be a core Russian city and refuse to consider ceding it. This does implicitly mean that our claims to the cities of Vitebsk and Krichev are recognised by the Russians and gives us a good chance to reclaim the majority of Belarusian-inhabited lands that were stuck under Russian rule."
whrpol.38.d_statusquo: "The Russian response to our offer of a separate peace was lukewarm to say the least. While they are willing to accept our independence, they refuse any territorial changes and demand the return to the pre-war status quo. This would mean that the blood shed by Belarusians would be largely for naught, but it may be the only way to save our nation from a potentially-deadly Russian counter-offensive."
whrpol.38.a: "Very well."
whrpol.38.b: "It's all or nothing. No peace!"

whrpol.39.t: "Negotiations Break Down"
whrpol.39.d: "Negotiations between Belarus and Russia have broken down, unable to find a middle ground acceptable to both parties. There will be no separate peace between the two nations, making intervention from the Third International unlikely."
whrpol.39.a: "..."

whrpol.40.t: "Negotiations Successful!"
whrpol.40.d: "The Russians have accepted our offer; there will be peace between our nations. That is, assuming we can convince the Third International that our membership in the Reichspakt was nothing but a pragmatic ploy to secure the foundations of a socialist state under Berlin's nose forced upon us by imperialist powers."
whrpol.40.a: "Surely, President Taraškievič won't fail us."

whrpol.41.t: "Belarus Breaks its Chains?"
whrpol.41.d: "With the fall of the perfidious German Empire, it hasn't taken long before Eastern Europe fell into chaos without their imperialist protector. One important case is the Belarusian People's Republic, led by a string of social-democratic governments since 1925. An emissary from Minsk arrived today with not only a peace offer from his government, but for Belarus to turn their arms against the remnants of the Reichspakt.\n\nThe diplomat quickly pleaded his case: The Belarusian Social-Democratic Party has always been working towards the establishment of a socialist state in their corner of Europe, having finally freed themselves from Russian imperialism, then from the foreign, enemy class of Polish noblemen. The emissary insists that their alignment with the German Empire was never their choice and merely a pragmatic ruse to build socialism under their very noses until their poor, under-developed country was ready for a revolution, else it would be squashed by the imperialist Germans or by the reactionaries of Russia that refuse to even recognise their nationhood.\n\nIt is up to us to decide whether we can trust these supposed revolutionaries-in-disguise and offer them our support and protection. Our response here will decide if we can secure an ally in Eastern Europe or if the Russians will begin their counter-offensive against the remnants of the Reichspakt."
whrpol.41.a: "We welcome all free peoples of Europe!"
whrpol.41.b: "Never! These crypto-plutocrats are worse than capitalists!"

whrpol.42.t: "Belarus Joins the International"
whrpol.42.d: "Our offer has been accepted by the revolutionaries of Europe and we have been accepted into the Third International. Of course, there are caveats in this deal, as we have to quickly prove that we are indeed a true revolutionary regime ourselves.\n\nAn emergency session of the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Hramada was held, formally sanctioning the government's plan to make peace with the International and make efforts to join them. This was quickly followed by an emergency of the Rada, rapidly passing a set of laws formally renouncing our ties with the fallen German Empire and announcing the government's intention to re-align the nation with the Syndicalist powers. Finally, a resolution was passed calling for the creation of a constitutional committee and the Rada's dissolution."
whrpol.42.a: "The Belarusian Revolution enters a new stage!"

whrpol.43.t: "Denied by the Third International"
whrpol.43.d: "With the Third International refusing our offer, we remain at war, humiliated and isolated diplomatically. The Belarusian People's Republic will fight to the end."
whrpol.43.a: "This is deeply embarrassing..."

whrpol.44.t: "Belarus Abandoned"
whrpol.44.d: "Despite their best efforts, the illegitimate Belarusian government was unable to back their threats up once it was clear that the Third International was unwilling to support them. Our agreement with them is to be considered null-and-void, with hostilities to resume immediately."
whrpol.44.a: "We will march into Minsk after all."

whrpol.45.t: "Peace with Belarus"
whrpol.45.d: "As per our agreement with the Belarusian government, a peace treaty was signed, officially mediated by the Third International, who also signed a treaty with the so-called Belarusian People's Republic. Belarus is now to be considered part of the Syndicalist sphere, but we will not have to sacrifice any more Russians for useless marshlands and forests."
whrpol.45.a: "So be it."

whrpol.46.t: "Anti-Government Protests"
whrpol.46.d: "The response to the final resolutions adopted before the dissolution of the Rada has been controversial. The opposition is openly decrying it as unconstitutional and consider it a blatant self-coup and there have been protests in the streets. This was followed by counter-protests by faithful workers and peasants, which has led to clashes in Minsk and Mogilev. The army has stepped in to restore order in some places, ensuring that the situation did not escalate further, but it is clear that our swift decision will take some time to be accepted by some segments of the population."
whrpol.46.a: "They will accept the revolution soon enough."

whrpol.47.t: "A Formal Request from [WHR.GetNameDef]"
whrpol.47.d: "With the peace settled and our European hegemony more secured than ever, our loyal ally on what was once the eastern frontier of Mitteleuropa we usually call [ROOT.GetNameDef], has made a formal request through their embassy in Berlin. For most of the interwar period, the Belarusians have been dependent on our protection and economic power to rise itself from a backwater to a nation, as they claim, equal to the rest of Europe. With their eastern claims secured and Russian threat all but destroyed, the [WHR.GetAdjective] ambassador believes that a new relationship between our nations should be considered. Specifically, one between two free nations rather than protector and vassal.\n\nIn short, the [WHR.GetAdjective] government is hoping to attain full independence within the Reichspakt and Mitteleuropa, ending their unofficial status as a puppet state of the German Empire, as a reward for loyalty throughout this bloody conflict. As there is no reason for [WHR.GetNameDef] to break away from the Reichspakt, with their loyalty thoroughly proven, there really is no reason for us to maintain a leash on them, and it would make them even more grateful for our role in their liberation. On the other hand, hardliners that have the Kaiser's ear are livid that they have the gall to make such a proposition in the first place, as their very existence is due to German goodwill."
whrpol.47.a: "Very well. Ludendorff would be happy to see this moment."
whrpol.47.b: "Of course not. Ungrateful Slavs..."

whrpol.48.t: "Independence!"
whrpol.48.d: "The German government has gratefully accepted our request. While we remain in the Reichspakt and Mitteleuropa, our relationship with Germany has become far less one-sided with the signature of a new commercial treaty and the shrinking in size of the German military mission. Our claims as an independent nation has never rung truer than now!"
whrpol.48.a: "Zhyve [WHR.GetName]!"

whrpol.49.t: "Request Denied"
whrpol.49.d: "For some god-forsaken reason, the German government has plainly refused our request for more independence. As it seems, loyalty's rewards are far more limited than we expected."
whrpol.49.a: "Bastards..."

whrpol.50.t: "Anti-German Uprising"
whrpol.50.d: "Despite the efforts of the occupying German authorities, the Leftist Hramadists organized a major uprising, and the socialist partisan movement became stronger than ever. In addition, a third party appeared in the confrontation: Field Marshal of the BNA, Bułak-Bałachowič, resolutely not accepting the German colonial government, tried to unite the conservative pro-Russian population and announced a campaign against Minsk. The future of Belarus, as always, is dark and uncertain."
whrpol.50.a: "Left Hramadists overthrow the Germans!"
whrpol.50.b: "General-Government stays strong."
whrpol.50.c: "Bułak-Bałachowič seizes power!"
whrpol.50.e: "The Black Banner rises over Belarus!"

whrpol.51.t: "Extraordinary Congress of Hramada"
whrpol.51.d: "With the foolish BSDP having left the country cowardly, the question of the power is now in the hands of the new Hramada. There are currently 3 parties, that are struggling for power: communist BRA, anarcho-syndicalist BPSR and Socialist-Federalists. Each of them are radically anti-German and socialist, but the future of the country is up to the Delegates to decide."
whrpol.51.a: "BRA will rule supreme!"
whrpol.51.b: "For Peasants and Belarus: BPS-R"
whrpol.51.c: "BSRH will represent Belarusians!"
whrpol.51.f: "BSDP will represent Belarusians!"
whrpol.51.e: "Socialist-Federalists seize the mandate"

whrpol.52.t: "Minsk Asks for Greater Belarus"
whrpol.52.d: "An emissary from [WHR.GetNameDef] has arrived with an interesting offer: the formal transfer of \"rightfully Belarusian\" lands, both from us, as an ally, but guarantees of such lands in neighbouring countries.\n\nHowever, we may be able to insist on a better deal. The ethnic situation in Krichev and Vitebsk are fairly clear, but much less so in Smolensk, which they also claim. Of course, we can also insist on the pre-war status quo, at least concerning Russian territories."
whrpol.52.c: "We can agree with ceding all their claimed states."
whrpol.52.b: "We can agree with ceding Krichev and Vitebsk, but Smolensk is Russian!"
whrpol.52.a: "We can agree only for non-Russian core lands."

whrpol.53.t: "The Russian Counter-Offer"
whrpol.53.d_split: "The [RUS.GetName] has taken interest in our offer of a separate, but feel that our demands are too extreme. Specifically, they consider the city of Smolensk to be a core Russian city and refuse to consider ceding it. This does implicitly mean that our claims to the cities of Vitebsk and Krichev are recognised by the Russians and gives us a good chance to reclaim the majority of Belarusian-inhabited lands that were stuck under Russian rule. Another part of Russian counter-offer is increased influence over our state."
whrpol.53.d_all_claims: "The [RUS.GetName] has taken interest in our offer, but they have demanded increased control over our government to secure their interests."
whrpol.53.d_statusquo: "The Russian response to our offer was lukewarm to say the least. They refuse any territorial changes in Russia, but they can accept our claims in the west."
whrpol.53.a: "Very well."
whrpol.53.b: "Refuse these demands!"

whrpol.54.t: "Belarus - Red Denmark!"
whrpol.54.d: "With the new governmental policy, elaborated by our People's Ministry of Agriculture under the lead of Zmitser Pryshčepaŭ, the Belarusian countryside is getting ready for various land policy adjustments.\n\nZmitser is carrying out an agrarian policy under the slogan 'Belarus is a Red Denmark', which consists in the freedom of peasants to choose forms of land use, and the support of Khutars. A notable military leader during the years of the Civil War, Zmitser was on the side of the Red Army and commanded the 2nd Smolensk Regimend, only later to switch sides and lead an anti-Bolshevik uprising against the food distributions. Joining the Belarusian Peasant-Worker Hramada and becoming one of Taraškievič's close associates, Pryshčepaŭ started to use only Belarusian in his writings and speeches and was the main opponent of Sierada's land policy, officially adopted by the King Uladzimir one year ago. In Pryshčepaŭ's opinion, Belarus should take an example not from its neighbours, like Russia, where there was an age-old communal order of life, despite the Bukharinist influence on his ideas, but from Denmark, which, although, 'poor by nature, like our Belarus, but got so rich from the peasant industry'."
whrpol.54.a: "An ambitious plan."

whrpol.55.t: "Matters of Internal Leadership Disputes within the Party"
whrpol.55.d: "As the Belarusian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries continues to consolidate its hold over the lands of [ROOT.GetNameDef], the Party has become wracked with internal debate as a question of leadership is raised by the wider masses. Two cliques have formed within the Party, centered around co-founders of our movement turned rivals Paluta Badunova and Tamas Hryb. Though both are supported by other leading figures within the party like Jazep Mamonka and even from within the military by figures like Jan Sierada, only one figure can rise to truly lead the Party and wider Belarus towards revolutionary socialist utopia. Both devoted to the cause and respected authors, theorists, and revolutionary politicians in their own right, Hryb and Badunova share a similar outlook on most policies. However, Hryb is notable for his focus on agrarianism and agricultural development along with his own writings on Socialism, while Badunova is notable for being one of the first women in academia to be at the forefront of a Socialist, or even wider political, movement in Europe. As such, we must decide upon the face of the Party and national government before we can progress with our plans of creating proletarian paradise."
whrpol.55.a: "Stand with party co-founder and leader Paluta Badunova"
whrpol.55.b: "Go with party co-founder and agricultural minister Tamaš Hryb"

whrpol.56.t: "An Offer from Moscow"
whrpol.56.d: "Today, a top secret message has reached the government in Minsk, in the form of an unmarked envelope delivered by a single un-uniformed courier, who left immediately after arriving. As soon as the letter and its potential consequences were comprehended, the necessity of the covert nature of its delivery was obvious.\n\nThe letter was marked with all the official seals of the [RUS.GetAdjective] government, and signed in [RUS.GetLeader]'s own hand, so there was no doubt to its veracity. Amid the carefully worded opening statements involving common socialist ideals, history and heritage, the initial subtext was made more explicit in the final words. The new Russian socialist regime has been successful in their second civil war, and have begun to look the future, and it is in our direction.\n\nWithout giving further dates and details, they infer that if the Reichspakt happened to come into a state of war with the Internationale, then they would be willing to accept us into their alliance, to fight against the Germans together. This arrangement comes with the guarantee of a high level of autonomy, greater than we have now, but would ultimately mean that we more or less remain a subject nation, albeit with the Russians as our overlords rather than the Germans. The other conditions would be that we fully adopt a socialist form of government, and, significantly, the Russians have promised us full and immediate control of the lands of [243.GetName] and [755.GetName] upon the outbreak of war.\n\nTaraškievič has shared these plans with only his most senior cabinet members, for fear of whistle-blowers. All agree that the Russians seem sincere in this offer, but the question is, would it be worth it?"
whrpol.56.a: "An interesting proposal..."
whrpol.56.b: "Russia should not be trusted."

whrpol.57.t: "[WHR.GetNameDef] Accepts"
whrpol.57.d: "In a surprisingly bluntly worded letter, [WHR.GetLeader] has promised that, if and when the time arrives, he and his people will turn on their overlords, and stand at our side against the reactionaries.\n\nThe promise of greater autonomy under us, a government with much more ideological and cultural similarities to them compared to the Germans, proved far too much for them. And all it will cost us is a couple of forests."
whrpol.57.a: "The Ostwall has already fallen,\nand Germany doesn't know it."

whrpol.58.t: "[WHR.GetNameDef] Refuses"
whrpol.58.d: "[WHR.GetName] has told us in no uncertain terms, that even if they believed that we would follow through with our agreement, they do not put too much hope in how successful our potential military campaign would be against the might of the Ostwall.\n\nIt appears we will have to bring socialism to our wayward brethren the old-fashioned way."
whrpol.58.a: "It was expected."

whrpol.59.t: "Time to Choose"
whrpol.59.d: "As war dawns once again on Europe, Taraškievič knows that the time has come for his final decision, on whether or not to follow through on the previous agreement with the Russians.\n\nDoes he lead his country to side with the Internationale, to socialism, and to further autonomy with more of his nation united under the [WHR.GetAdjective] government? Or does he stay true to the Germans, who have tolerated and supported his rule so far?"
whrpol.59.a: "Follow through on the secret pact."
whrpol.59.b: "Stay loyal to Germany."

whrpol.60.t: "Russia Occupies [WHR.GetName]!"
whrpol.60.d: "The unthinkable has occurred! The White Ruthenian government, lead by [WHR.GetLeader], has formally defected from the Reichspakt, and sided with the [RUS.GetName].\n\nIt was from Russian control that we gave them their precious autonomy that they craved after the Weltkrieg, but seemingly their attempted nation-building since has been for naught, as it is back to the blasted Russians that they have crawled.\n\nThey will have an example made of them, along with the others."
whrpol.60.a: "Traitors!"

whrpol.61.t: "Formation of the [FROM.GetAdjective] Autonomy"
whrpol.61.d: "The [WHR.GetAdjective] government has formally declared war on the German Empire and the Reichspakt, and joined the Third Internationale as an Autonomous region of the [RUS.GetName].\n\nThe recent onset of war has meant that the physical handover of governmental authority, and responsibility for administration of [243.GetName] and [755.GetName], was over within a matter of minutes, without ceremony. However, the fact remains that we have gained valuable and small new ally, ever closer to the heart of Germany's rotten empire."
whrpol.61.a: "Excellent."

whrpol.62.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Breaks the Deal"
whrpol.62.d: "Despite his utmost assurances on the deal that we had previously brokered, long before the onset of conflict, [WHR.GetLeader] has reneged on his promise to us.\n\nWe had agreed for the [WHR.GetAdjective] people to join the Internationale, with the promise of continued autonomy, and even some of our own territory, if it meant they would leave the Reichspakt and declare war on the Germans. No such events have happened, and all communication with Minsk has been met with silence.\n\nWith this all being ignored, it seems we will have to bring them socialism the old-fashioned way."
whrpol.62.a: "Not unexpected."

whrpol.63.t: "Betrayal in the Reichspakt"
whrpol.63.d: "White Ruthenia, Germany's small Oststaat, has defected to the Internationale.\n\nConservative critics of the quasi-syndicalist [WHR.GetAdjective] government, previously tolerated by Germany for their loyalty, have had their trepidations entirely vindicated, as [WHR.GetLeader] has led his people to join with [RUS.GetNameDef] as an autonomous region, and the promise of more territory.\n\nThe true intentions behind years of feigned loyalty to Germany and increasingly left-wing politics have come to light, as a fracture emerges on the eastern edges of the Reichspakt."
whrpol.63.a: "Wonderful news!"
whrpol.63.b: "This is a catastrophe!"
whrpol.63.c: "Germany's empire crumbles..."

whrpol.114.t: "Peace with [WHR.GetName]?"
whrpol.114.d.stalemate: "With the wayward state of Belarus in rebellion against the Reichspakt war was the natural conclusion. Unfortunately our forces have not been able to breakthrough and popular anger against the war is rising. Perhaps it is time to sue for peace?"
whrpol.114.d.losing_ground: "ith the wayward state of Belarus in rebellion against the Reichspakt war was the natural conclusion. Unfortunately they have been able to capitulate [capitulated_ally.GetName]) and fears are growing of a further assault. Perhaps it is time to sue for peace?"
whrpol.114.a: "We have no choice."
whrpol.114.b: "We will not negotiate with these traitors!"

whrpol.115.t: "Peace with Germany?"
whrpol.115.d: "Surprisingly the Germans have come to us begging for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Doing so would end the war now but Germany could strike in the future..."
whrpol.115.a: "Victory at last!"
whrpol.115.b: "No peace with the imperialists!"

whrpol.116.t: "[WHR.GetName] Refuses Peace"
whrpol.116.d: "Despite our offer of peace to the Belarusians to finally end this war they have refused any negotiations, we will have to fight this to the bitter end!"
whrpol.116.a: "We shall crush these upstarts!"

whrpol.117.t: "Germany Refuses Negotiations"
whrpol.117.d: "Unsurprisingly Germany has refused any form of negotiations for peace despite our strong hand. It seems that they will not yield until Belarusian boots stand in Berlin."
whrpol.117.a: "A fight to the death, then."

## Anarchy Events ##
whrpol.100.t: "Question of Kropotkin"
whrpol.100.d: "The foundation of the slogans of the Charnaznamentsy was initially the thought of the aristocrat-anarchist Peter Kropotkin. Thus, according to these ideas, man was to become not only the owner of the means of production, but also of all goods. Private property would be abolished and replaced only by temporary utilitarian property, which would cease as soon as the use of a given thing ended.  A community self-organized into communes would allocate its own labor responsibilities and production goals. Any boards, parties or unions would exist only temporarily. Putting this idea into action, however, required more radical measures, about which Kropotkin was silent. These goals were to be achieved by leading the state to collapse by means of economic terror (aimed at the possessing classes) and unmotivated terror (aimed at entire collectivities independent of individual guilt). Over time, Juda Grossman-Roshchin came to the conclusion that the orthodoxy of sticking to Kropotkin's slogans was an inconsistency. After all, Kropotkin himself was a representative of the vanity classes, indulged in nationalist slogans during the Great War (calling on the Anarhcists to support Russia) or was reluctant to reach for radical measures. In his opinion, terror should be decisive, rapid and radically total in character, and all organizations could only continue their existence until the revolution was over.\n\nOther local anarchist leaders such as Mark Mratchny, however, would have preferred to limit oppressive measures and leave the old trade unions in place as entities pursuing the goals of society, in order for them to develop into the nucleus of the Kropotkinist Communes."
whrpol.100.a: "Let's stay with the orthodoxy of Kropotkin's thought and leave the trade unions behind."
whrpol.100.b: "Kropotkin is not radical enough!"

whrpol.101.t: "Goods Vouchers"
whrpol.101.d: "The abolition of money came as a shock to some communities, forced for years by bourgeois training to live according to the rules of the money economy. Some of these communities, however, introduced peculiar vouchers, and not in order to trade with other communities, but to conduct trade within the local community using them. According to the keenest minds of our movement, this reactionary attitude may lead to a revival of the money economy"
whrpol.101.a: "Let's temporarily tolerate these practices"
whrpol.101.b: "Let's allow their use in community billing"
whrpol.101.c: "That's reaction! Ban these practices, only commodity-exchange trade will allow a break with economic oppression"

whrpol.102.t: "Organized Crime"
whrpol.102.d: "The overthrow of state institutions was associated with the unexpected emergence of organized crime groups. Some of them had existed for a long time and only now began to operate others have only recently begun to emerge independently. Some of them have an ethnic character, such as gangs of Poles, Belarusians, Jews and Lithuanians, others have a multinational character. All of them, however, resort to the same criminal activity - extortion and other crimes of human trafficking, forced labor and pimping."
whrpol.102.a: "Let's temporarily accept their operations"
whrpol.102.b: "Spaciousness is another form of response. Let's fill it out at all costs."

whrpol.103.t: "Mandatory Work" 
whrpol.103.d: "Kropotkin's ideas assumed that people are good by nature and want to work for themselves and the rest of society, as only the state forces them to take a different attitude. Of course, there is a certain group of people who cannot work, like the elderly, disabled, minors and single mothers, and they should also be taken care of by society. Unfortunately, there are also a few demoralized individuals who do not want to work because they do not like it. So there was an intellectual ferment in the anarchist movement. Some of the activists believed, following Kropotkin, that such individuals should be isolated from society and deprived of mutual aid. Others like Juda Grossman-Roshchin argued that they should be forcibly coerced into labor until they were rehabilitated, and that the inistitution of forced labor itself should be maintained for an unspecified interim period."
whrpol.103.a: "Send parasites away from the social bracket!"
whrpol.103.b: "Introduce forced labor!"

whrpol.104.t: "Leisure Classes" 
whrpol.104.d: "The overthrow of the state caused a large number of people - stonecutters, bankers, factory owners and aristocrats - to lose their unworthy base based on exploitative subsistence overnight. Neither they nor their families have, any useful skills for society and are mere freeloaders. According to the principals of unmotivated terror, they should await their class perpetuation for merely belonging to the exploiting classes. However, this is quite a large group of people, and some believe that some of them could be re-educated by working for the community. The problem of the possible cost of teror is also raised."
whrpol.104.a: "You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs - bludgeon them all"
whrpol.104.b: "Some of them could be spared and re-educated"

whrpol.105.t: "Churches, Synagogues and Mosques"
whrpol.105.d: "For most anarchists, religion is 'opium for the people.' However, both Mratchny and Grossman-Roschin see the positive patterns flowing from religion. Of course, religious institutions should be abolished and their property socialized, but this socialization could take place by transferring the seized property to religious-revolutionary organizations glorifying, for example, Jesus-Revolutionary or St. Joseph the Worker. Some even believe that relying on the religiosity of the peasant masses could be a decent way to introduce our values in the countryside. Others point out that this would, however, be a deviation from the principles of unmotivated terror directed against the parasitic clergy."
whrpol.105.a: "Support theology of liberation"
whrpol.105.b: "Seize the property and hand it over to the local communities to let them decide"
whrpol.105.c: "Destroy these symbols of oppression - down with churches, synagogues and mosques!"

whrpol.106.t: "Schools and Universities"
whrpol.106.d: "Huge fortunes have been amassed by people who have never worked in a truly demanding and physical position - professors, artists or writers. The goods they produced have no tangible value and the budgets they used to train them are huge and valuable. A person does not need the ability to read poetry or count integrals to work, so something should be done with these assets and these people. Of course, professors, lawyers or newspaper editors will share (in whole or in part) the fate of the vanity classes, but what should be done with the assets of schools and editorial offices?"
whrpol.106.a: "Burn down these institutions of the old order"
whrpol.106.b: "Take them and find a new use for them"

whrpol.107.t: "Congress of the Delegates of All Communes"
whrpol.107.d: "After we have overthrown the institutions of oppression on the Dnieper, Notea and Vistula rivers, the time has come to decide the further fate of our movement. Some delegates believe that we should realize the dream of Bakunin and Kropotkin to unite the Slavic world within the framework of the Slavic Union - from the Oder to the Urals, while others would prefer to avoid references to nationality and establish a Union of Communes, which would encompass the multinational territories from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Still others would prefer to fall into isolationism and limit the size of our power to the territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania inhabited by Belarusians or Lithuanians."
whrpol.107.a: "Slavic Union"  
whrpol.107.b: "Union of People's Communes" 
whrpol.107.c: "Let the people decide" 

whrpol.108.t: "The Evolution of Anarchist Theory"
whrpol.108.d: "As our Anarchist society continuously evolves along with the Chernoe Znamia under Mark Mratchny, so too do our notions towards Kropotkinite theory. Though we remain loyal to his idea of using Anarchism in order to bring about a truly Communist utopia, new strains of Anarchism tied to Syndicalism, Egoism, and Individualism have begun to sprout up like weeds. These new groups can be broadly lumped into two groups, being the Anarcho-Syndicalists that claim that our revolution must take inspiration from the dominant Syndicalist powers in the Third Internationale like the CGT and the TUC in order to survive and foster Leftist Unity, and the Illegalists that claim that the State has not yet been destroyed, and instead has merely changed hands and been dyed a revolutionary and bloody red, and as such they continue to spread the propaganda of the deed through Illegalist actions against the Black Banner regime.\n\nAs the Illegalists siphon funds, smuggle arms, incite small rebellions and uprisings among the wider populaces, and more, the Syndicalists organize black-cat strikes, hunger strikes, walkouts, and other examples of worker mass action among our cities’ industrial sectors and organized unions, even within the normally-stable Bund. These insurrectionary acts fly in the face of our organizationalist ideas inspired by Kropotkin, and something must now be done. Should we pursue the platformist approach and grant these Illegalists and Syndicalists a seat at the table of our wider Anarchist coalition, or should we pursue a more synthesist direction by directly incorporating some of their more palatable ideas on the nature and place of unions and the free individual within our stateless revolution? Alternatively, we can always just silence these radicals in order to preserve our specific vision of utopia..."
whrpol.108.a: "Silence these Illegalist and Syndicalist cells, one way or another..."  
whrpol.108.b: "Give the Syndicalists and Illegalists a place upon our broad Anarchist platform." 
whrpol.108.c: "Pursue synthesis and incorporate some Illegalist ideas."
whrpol.108.e: "Pursue synthesis and incorporate some Anarcho-Syndicalist ideas."

### Economic events ###
whreco.1.t: "Black Monday Hits Belarus"
whreco.1.d: "The shockwaves of the collapse of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the ensuing economic turbulence have reached all corners of Mitteleuropa. Its impact on us however has been much more subdued than other members of Mitteleuropa, as our country is much less industrially developed; we have emerged from Black Monday relatively unscathed, though we'll still need to minimise damages before the situation escalates."
whreco.1.a: "A blessing in disguise?"

whreco.2.t: "[WHR.GetName] Requests Economic Aid"
whreco.2.d: "[WHR.GetName], our small ally in the east, has a relatively undeveloped economy which was quite shaken by the economic crisis. Since the regime change is far more open to German interests and has loosened labour laws in our favour, they've requested that we give them a generous loan to finally pull them out of the crisis. Since their economy is quite small, this will barely be a dent in our accounts, but even such a small dent may be unwelcome in these trying times."
whreco.2.a: "Sure, we can help our little ally."
whreco.2.b: "They'll need to deal with it themselves."
whreco.3.t: "Germany Bails us out"
whreco.3.d: "The German government has agreed to facilitate a generous loan to help us in our final recovery from the economic crisis. Naturally, we could trust our old ally in the matter."
whreco.3.a: "We thank our eternal German friends!"
whreco.4.t: "Germany Leaves us in the Dust"
whreco.4.d: "Shockingly, the German government has refused, claiming they were unable to, help us in our final recovery from the economic crisis. This has soured relations with our old ally, leaving us in a slow drift towards recovery."
whreco.4.a: "So much for friendship..."

whrlandreform.1.t: "Success of Plan Sierada!"
whrlandreform.1.d: "The ambitious program by People's Minister of Agriculture Jan Sierada to revitalise the land reform program and bring Belarus to the modern era has proven success! As reports from around the country have begun trickling into the hands of the ministry reporting the increased effectiveness of Belarusian farmers across the country. With the land reform program a success, the BSDP's position as the hegemons of the Rada is left unassailable, assuring a fair and democratic socialist country for all!"
whrlandreform.1.a: "Three Hurrahs for Jan Sierada!"

whrlandreform.2.t: "Land Dispute in the Countryside"
whrlandreform.2.d: "In the vast countryside of Belarus, land is primarily owned by landlords for agricultural purposes, worked by Belarusian peasants, this status quo has existed for decades at this point, but the introduction of Plan Sierada has put the situation on its head, one landlord was attacked by a disgruntled peasant with syndicalist sympathies while touring his land together with his family, while a very rare occurrence as most of the population of the countryside is not politically involved, the scandal has reached the front pages of many newspapers across the country. With landlords lobbying the government to compensate the attacked party while the people, disgruntled with the landlords for some time now, demand that the government shouldn't favour the landlord class."
whrlandreform.2.a: "Compensate the landlord, we can't antagonise them during this critical moment."
whrlandreform.2.b: "\"Maybe raise living standards for the workers in your estate?\""

whrlandreform.3.t: "BSDP-L Presents Demands"
whrlandreform.3.d: "Despite lukewarm support from the left wing of the BSDP for Plan Sierada, many within it are now less than satisfied about our handling of the plan, citing us being "too soft" on landlords and the rich and "betraying the ideals" of the Hramada. In a paper signed by several key members of the BSDP-L, they have presented their letter of protest to Taraškievič , how to handle this letter of protest is a matter of debate however..."
whrlandreform.3.a: "Ignore the letter, we are doing well our own way."
whrlandreform.3.b: "Maybe the BSDP-L has got a point?"

whrlandreform.4.t: "A Cabinet Meeting"
whrlandreform.4.d: "While our intent was to handle Plan Sierada by balancing public support with general effectiveness to achieve success, some within the government cabinet still state that we don't have enough of either of the two, either the issue is that we're not listening to the people enough, or that we're listening to the people too much. This sort of confusion is hindering the implementation of Plan Sierada, so in an effort to settle the matter, [ROOT.GetLeader] has organised a cabinet meeting to debate the handling of Plan Sierada."
whrlandreform.4.a: "We need to focus on effectiveness."
whrlandreform.4.b: "We need to listen to the people."

whrlandreform.5.t: "Bureaucratic Issues"
whrlandreform.5.d: "The People's Ministry of Agriculture has received complaints by peasants in the countryside of corruption in the bureaucracy tasked with handling Plan Sierada."
whrlandreform.5.a: "We need to do something about that!"

whrlandreform.6.t: "Minor Protest"
whrlandreform.6.d: "Disgruntled workers have organised a minor protest in one of our cities! They claim that the government isn't doing enough for the people when handling Plan Sierada"
whrlandreform.6.a: "We need to listen to the people!"

whrlandreform.7.t: "Major Protest"
whrlandreform.7.d: "Tens of thousands of disgruntled workers have rallied today in the streets of Minsk to protest the government's handling of Plan Sierada, alleging that the government has forgotten its purpose of serving the people and that it's cosying up to the elites, much like the old Tsardom of old. The latter has gotten under the skin of many nationalists in Minsk and the Rada."
whrlandreform.7.a: "We're doing what we can!"

whrmisc.3.t: "Literacy Rate Improves"
whrmisc.3.d: "[WHR.GetName] has always struggled with abysmal literacy rates. During the census of 1897, the rate was as low as 10% in some regions. With great investment during the first years of Belarusian independence, the rate steadily improved and neared 50% by the mid-30s. With the construction of additional schools in rural areas and the increasing number of qualified teachers, a good amount of the rural population can now read and write, and we should no longer need to worry about lack of literacy significantly impacting our nation anymore."
whrmisc.3.a: "Wonderful!"
whrmisc.4.t: "[WHR.GetName] Contracts German Company"
whrmisc.4.d: "The White Ruthenian government, needing equipment for its meager armed forces, has contracted a German firm to help them supply them with old military hardware from the Weltkrieg long retired from our stockpile. We welcome our businesses making profit in our Eastern allies and bring us some profits."
whrmisc.4.a: "As long as they can delay the Russians in the end."
whrmisc.5.t: "Rifles from Germany"
whrmisc.5.d: "Our order from Germany has arrived; some two and a half thousand old Mausers from the Weltkrieg to help arm our troops."

whrmisc.6.a: "We cannot survive without the big guns."
whrmisc.7.t: "Old Fighters from Germany"
whrmisc.7.d: "Our order from Germany has arrived; a hundred biplane fighters to help bolster our Air Fleet. It may not be much and they may be obsolete, but even an old warplane at all is better than none in the modern battlefield."
whrmisc.7.a: "They better not be flying caskets."
whrmisc.8.t: "Support Equipment from Germany"

whrmisc.10.t: "A Very Jewish Day"
whrmisc.10.d: "A humble, unimpressive looking Jewish man was seen touring the streets of Minsk, Pinsk and Babruysk, introducing himself in Yiddish, and sometimes in German as Berl Katznelson. A Zionist and labour activist, he'd been touring Europe for the last few weeks, going from Germany to Poland, to Lithuania, to the Baltic region, and now, to Belarus, seeking support from the local Jews for the Zionist cause. Writing for the labour newspaper 'Davar', published all the way in Palestine, Katznelson wrote a glowing report of the BSDP's commitment to equal rights for all and preservation of multiculturalism. Writing about his land of birth:\n\n\"Belorussia is seemingly a complete rejection of the status quo of Poland, where the Poles stood at the top and Jews at the bottom. In Belorussia, Jews, Poles, Belarusians and Russians all have equal rights and accommodations, a truly inspiring ideal for the Zionist movement.\" Katznelson met and argued with senior Bund members in Minsk regarding the merits of the Zionist ideal, Katznelson admitted that the success of the Jewish Bund in Eastern Europe inspired him to create a Zionist united workers front in Palestine, even if he may disagree with the \"Exilism\" of the Jewish Bund. \"I wish our boys knew how to receive an opponent so warmly.\" Katznelson is only one of several prominent Zionist activists around Eastern Europe, which sheds light on the vibrancy of Jewish life in Belarus and other countries."
whrmisc.10.a: "Interesting!"
whrmisc.11.t: "Completion of the Central House of Officers"
whrmisc.11.d: "Beginning in 1934, a new building on Central Square has been completed: The Central House of Officers. Designed by none other than the most prominent Belarusian architect Iosif Langbard, the building includes many different amenities for soldiers, officers, and locals to enjoy, from a restaurant to a cinema, along with offices for the People's Army and the German Military Mission. It is planned to further expand the building to house the Central Military Library and a theatre hall."
whrmisc.11.a: "Modern facilities for the army!"
whrmisc.12.t: "\"Bielarusi ardenanosnaj\" by Janka Kupala"
whrmisc.12.d: "Janka Kupala, the far more famous pen name for Iván Daminikavič Lucévič, has published a voluminous collection of his many poems entitled \"Orderly Belarus\". Kupala is already known as one of the greatest writers in the Belarusian language and as a patriot and enthusiastic supporter of Belarusian nationhood. His earlier poems had earned the ire of Tsarist authorities, while his work during the Weltkrieg was full of anti-war sentiments. After the February Revolution, his tone changed to become far more optimistic and he notably translated the Internationale into Belarusian.\n\nThis new volume is the biggest compilation of his works yet and will hopefully continue to inspire other Belarusians writers and expand the body of works in the language, helping it cement itself as more than just a \"peasants' tongue\".\n\n\"O Young Belarus, come forth, take thy place of honour and fame among nations!\""
whrmisc.12.a: "We can all appreciate the work of the People's Poet!"
whrmisc.13.t: "Expansion of the National Academy of Sciences"
whrmisc.13.d: "The Belarusian National Academy of Sciences was founded in 1929 as the Institute of Belarusian Culture, Inbelcult, expanded. With this expansion grew the need to house this new institution. Iosif Langbard was commissioned to design its main building, with its curved archway, and it was just completed today. This will allow the academy to improve their research capabilities and staff of faculty and scientists."
whrmisc.13.a: "A symbol of progress."
whrmisc.14.t: "Opening of the State Opera"
whrmisc.14.d: "As the limits of the National Theatre became clear, the government commissioned Iosif Langbard, [WHR.GetName]'s most prominent architect, to design a building to house the National Opera and Ballet studio on the Trinity Hill district of Minsk. The large new building, another example of Langbard's constructivist style, houses 1200 seats.\n\nThe inauguration is set to premier \"Michaś Padhorny\" by Belarusian composer Jaŭhien Karlavič Cikocki. The four-act opera is set during the Weltkrieg, the Russian Revolutions, and the birth of the Belarusian People's Republic, featuring two Belarusian peasants, Michaś and Marysi, and their complicated history as lovers."
whrmisc.14.a: "Wonderful!"
whrmisc.15.t: "\"Bielaruskim partyzanam\" by Janka Kupala"
whrmisc.15.d: "With the war against Russia raging, Janka Kupala has published a series of poems exalting the resistance of Belarusians against the invaders. The first of these is \"Belarusian Partisans\", featuring the leader of [RUS.GetNameDef], [RUS.GetLeader], as a bloodthirsty vampire and murderer, calling for the brave partisans of Belarus to enact vengeance on the invaders.\n\nPartisans, Partisans!\nChildren of Belarus!\nCut down the nasty Russians!\nSo they may never return!"
whrmisc.15.a: "Kupala's contribution to the war effort."
whrmisc.16.t: "Formation of the Belarusian State Philharmonic"
whrmisc.16.d: "The world of the arts in [WHR.GetNameDef] is ever changing, and music is no exception. In order to pool their resources together, the State Symphony Orchestra, State Choir, National Folk Orchestra and Dance Ensemble formed the State Philharmonic. The demand for live musical performances has sharply increased since independence, and many people are willing to attend them despite the lack of modern facilities, accepting the uncomfortable seating and makeshift sets to satisfy their craving for beautiful classical and folk songs. The current main goal of the Philharmonic is to secure state support to build a proper, modern concert hall and the facilities needed for practice, for despite the symbolic importance of the National Theatre building, it has proven to be too small, uncomfortable, and with very poor acoustics for orchestral and choir music.\n\nFor the time being, however, the Philharmonic displays the growth of performance arts in [WHR.GetNameDef]. The State Symphony Orchestra has been touring neighbouring states, and their performances in Ukraine gained particular acclaim. The future is bright for the increasing number of talented Belarusian musicians."
whrmisc.16.a: "The people deserve beautiful music."
whrmisc.17.t: "Death of Liavon Dubiejkaŭski"
whrmisc.17.d: "Liavon Ivanavič Dubiejkaŭski, architect, writer, and politician, passed away today at the age of 71 of stomach cancer. For his great contributions to Belarusian culture, he has been granted a state funeral and many esteemed academicians, political figures, and many other notables will be in attendance.\n\nBorn in 1864 in the village of Dubiejkava near [243.GetName], Dubiejkaŭski was born into a small noble family that, like many, had fallen from grace after the partitions of Poland. He was interested in Belarusian culture from an early age, collecting folklore and writing down oral accounts, dabbling in writing himself with fables and poetry. Against the wishes of his parents, he moved to Warsaw to study construction and architecture. As a professional builder from the 1890s on, he worked to restore numerous Catholic churches around the Belarusian lands. In 1893, he was contracted to build the Immaculate Conception Church in [242.GetName] and, from then on, founded his own successful construction company. After the Russo-Japanese War, however, the construction industry crashed and he liquidated his business, leaving for Paris to further his studies in architecture.\n\nDubiejkaŭski became acquainted with the Belarusian national movement during the Weltkrieg as a writer for the important nationalist paper Naša Niva, meeting brothers Ivan and Anton Luckievič of the Hramada. While in Petrograd in the winter of 1916, he designed a potential national flag for Belarus, which he never submitted and the white-red-white by Klaŭdzij Duž-Dušeŭski would become the national flag. From 1917 on, he was devoted to the Belarusian national cause, eventually joining the Social-Democrats. In 1918, he was made \"chief architect\" of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR), designing national awards for the government and working on different school-building projects across the country. The next year, he went to Warsaw again, this time as head of the Belarusian consulate, and he would soon become the first ambassador to Poland, helping thaw relations after several years of anxiety from Polish attitudes towards Belarusians.\n\nWhile remaining active in politics and writing profusely for different nationalist papers, Dubiejkaŭski returned to his work in architecture. His work began to slow down in the 1930s, and after 1935, poor health forced him into retirement.\n\nThe long life of this illustrious Belarusian leaves behind a legacy that will live on with the nation, cemented in stone and concrete across the land."
whrmisc.17.a: "The nation pays its respects"
whrmisc.18.t: "Death of Vasil Zacharka"
whrmisc.18.d: "Today, [WHR.GetNameDef] lost one of its founding fathers, Vasiĺ Ivanavič Zacharka. One of the leaders of the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists, he is to be granted a state funeral with the highest honours as one of the nation's most prominent politician.\n\nBorn in a village near [94.GetName] in 1877, Zacharka became a teacher in 1895. Three years later, he became a cadet in the Russian Army and would serve until 1902, only to be mobilised again in 1904 to serve until 1917 as a junior officer.\n\nBy the time he had been demobilised the first time, he was already a member of the Belarusian Socialist Hramada, and on October 22, 1917, he was one of the organisers of the Congress of Belarusian Soldiers on the Western Front, soon becoming secretary of the Central Military Council. As a participant in the All-Belarusian Congress, he was briefly imprisoned by the Bolsheviks before being freed when the German Army occupied Minsk, and he began collaborating with the Germans afterwards. From February 1918, he was a member of the government of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR), serving in different treasurer and other roles in finances, even briefly as People's Minister of Finance. After 1919, he requested to be transferred out of the People's Ministry of Finance into the fledgling diplomatic service instead. In June, he was sent to Berlin, heading the BNR's diplomatic mission to the German Emperor. When Germany transformed our state into a Monarchy after the Russian Civil War, his mission was upgraded to an embassy, becoming the first ambassador to the German Empire.\n\nZacharka remained in Berlin until December 1925 when he returned to Minsk. Returning home, our first King would appoint him and his Non-Partisan Bloc as members of the government, in spite of the social-democratic dominated Rada. \n\nThe esteemed leader leaves behind a respectable political career and the massive government archives that he has been working on for almost two decades. He will be remembered as one of the founding fathers of our nation, helping the country earn recognition from the rest of the world."
whrmisc.18.a: "The nation loses a founding father."
whrmisc.18.b: "Snap elections should be held soon to replace our leader."

whrmisc.19.t: "Visit of Former King Waldemar and Prince Žyhimont"
whrmisc.19.d: "As part of a concerted effort by the government to maintain good relations with the German Empire, the ambassador in Berlin secured an official visit from two princes of the Hohenzollern family. Brothers Waldemar and Žyhimont, formally the Royal Family to our nation, arrived in Minsk the other day before embarking on a tour of the country tailored to their interests.\n\nUpon their arrival, they were greeted by the expected military parade, where Waldemar quietly inspected the details on the uniforms of the soldiers of the People's Army. As avid automotive enthusiasts, the royals visited the burgeoning Minsk Automobile Plant, impressed by the ability of the small nation of [WHR.GetName] to even produce cars in the first place considering the state of the nation when they left. The visit concluded with a ball at the National Theatre, bringing together the majority of the region's notable figures of high society.\n\nThe publicity stunt proved to be successful as it went without incidents and was presented positively in the German press, helping raise awareness and improve our image abroad. A few days later, [GetLeader] received a letter and package from former King Waldemar: It contained a set of tin toy soldiers made by the ex-King himself, that looked like Belarusian soldiers, with the letter signed \"Uladzimir\", a his former name as King.. Prince Žyhimont's gratitude was felt more indirectly, as the more business-savvy royal returned with more than a few economic opportunities for his friends in German industry, who would happily mention that they had gotten a tip from a certain \"Prince Žyhimont\"."
whrmisc.19.a: "See what we can do without you?"

whrmisc.20.t: "Administrators Forced Out"
whrmisc.20.d: "Bureaucrats sent to the frontier to help rebuild and win over the locals have been dispersed as the enemy retook control of the disputed state. Our efforts have been interrupted for the time being."
whrmisc.20.a: "Damn them!"
whrmisc.21.t: "Military Administration Forced Out"
whrmisc.21.d: "The military officers in charge of rebuilding a disputed region has been forced out by an enemy offensive. Our efforts have been interrupted for the time being."
whrmisc.21.a: "Curse them!"
whrmisc.22.t: "Integration Efforts Interrupted"
whrmisc.22.d: "Our attempts to integrate a claimed state occupied by our forces has been interrupted. As our forces no longer have uncontested control, our administrators and military forces have been forced to withdraw, delaying its integration into [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
whrmisc.22.a: "Damn!"

whrmisc.23.t: "Accident Above Svecha"
whrmisc.23.d: "The entire series of events started when a Belarusian farmer informed the police of the wreck of an aircraft that had fallen to his fields, in the small village of Svecha, some sixty kilometres west from Vitebsk. When the police arrived to the scene, what was initially thought to be a civilian accident turned out to be a Russian scout plane. The plane was largely burned, and its camera was removed. There was no sight of the pilot, though a manhunt was started in the entire district of Biešankovicki.\n\nWhat was left of the plane was quickly delivered to the Borovka Air Base for further examination. Despite the pilot's attempts to destroy the machine, aviation engineers managed to identify the plane as a little known Kamov gyroplane primarily equipped for aerial photographing. It seemed probable that it had been photographing the important bridge of Svecha, which lies on the route from Vitebsk to Minsk. Evidence of this level of Russian war planning against Germany's eastern allies is alarming on entirely new level, as many have believed that Russia would not dare to try their luck with Germany once again. Germany has promised to deploy additional air escadres to Belarus, and the military readiness of the eastern allies has been increased."
whrmisc.23.a: "The dark clouds are gathering."

whrmisc.24.t: "The Unlikely Union of Socialism and Protestantism"
whrmisc.24.d: "As the sun rises over the Belarusian lands, a sense of spiritual unity among the diverse Protestant communities is palpable.\n\nIn a fascinating and unlikely fusion of faith and politics, Protestant politicians with diverse spiritual backgrounds are emerging as the leaders of left-leaning socialist parties in [WHR.GetName]. Notably, Branisłaŭ Taraškievič, a Methodist, and Anton Luckievič, a Calvinist, have embraced roles at the forefront of the socialist movement, including in the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union (Hramada), which has traditionally maintained a stance of religious ambivalence.\n\nIndeed, these Protestant leaders have effectively integrated their faith with their political aspirations, deftly uniting the values of socialism with their own spiritual convictions. This unique confluence has engendered an atmosphere of unity and collaboration among diverse Protestant denominations in Belarus, as they recognize the power of their shared influence on the political landscape.\n\nInterestingly, this phenomenon of faith-infused politics extends beyond the Protestant community. Adam Stankievič, a Catholic priest, serves as a leader of the Belarusian Christian Democracy (BKhD) party. While BKhD holds more centrist positions, its program carries a noticeable leftist bias, reflecting Stankievič's vision of meshing Christian values with socially progressive policies. This further highlights the growing trend of religious figures navigating the complexities of Belarusian politics while staying true to their faith."
whrmisc.24.a: "The ecclesiastical reverberations on socialism!"

whiteruthenia.2.t: "Rethinking Our Place In the Reichspakt."
whiteruthenia.2.d: "[ROOT.GetLeader] has called a secret cabinet to debate our continued stance on the Reichspakt. While supporting Germany in their war against Syndicalism has gained us little, leaving the alliance would remove our protection from other threats such as a resurgent Russia. Several ministers have proposed that we leave the Reichspakt and try to court the Russians with an alliance directly while a few others are demanding we become isolationist. What should we do?"
whiteruthenia.2.a: "Stay loyal to the Germans."
whiteruthenia.2.b: "We need no outside help!"

whiteruthenia.5.t: "White Ruthenia Abandons the Reichspakt"
whiteruthenia.5.d: "The treacherous White Ruthenians under their new king Žyhimont has left the Reichspakt. Their ambassador in Berlin formally tendered a letter to the Reichstag claiming that White Ruthenia is a sovereign nation able to make its own decisions. Even more shocking, White Ruthenia has gone ahead and entered a formal alliance with the Russians, abandoning our military effort in its time of need. This outrageous betrayal has torn asunder our entire defensive plan for the East in the face of the expansionist Russian threat. While some officials are calling for calm senior members of the general staff are itching to go to war, convinced that the loss of our eastern ally is worth diverting troops away from the Syndicalist war to address."
whiteruthenia.5.a: "Leave the fools to it then."
whiteruthenia.5.b: "Send in the troops!"

whiteruthenia.30.t: "Black Monday hits White Ruthenia!"
whiteruthenia.30.d: "Almost two weeks ago, the value of the Berlin Stock Exchange suddenly collapsed, wiping out the value of hundreds of companies and devastating markets across German-dominated Europe. Now the effects of the shock have finally begun to wash over White Ruthenia. Dozens of prominent companies have fallen into insolvency or shed most of their work-force, the White Ruthenian Rubieĺ is losing value, and our exports are falling off a cliff. Any foreigners with cash left standing wouldn't touch our economy with a barge pole."
whiteruthenia.30.a: "Damn those investors!"

whiteruthenia.31.t: "Ostwall Overhaul"
whiteruthenia.31.d: "With the Russian armed forces emerging from years of neglect and becoming a fearsome force once again, it is high time for us to improve our somewhat diminished border defences. Our top military leaders have petitioned the central government to devote extra funding to improving existing fortifications along the border with Russia, known as the Ostwall. Once fully restored, such massive fortifications will surely help to stop any kind of Russian assault."
whiteruthenia.31.a: "Fund it!"

whiteruthenia.32.t: "Ostwall Supply Depots"
whiteruthenia.32.d: "A series of new reinforced supply depots have been constructed, solving one of the most pressing vulnerabilities in the design of the White Ruthenian section of the Ostwall. With ammunition dumps far better protected from enemy artillery and commando raids, our defences have been strengthened immeasurably. Should we stop here, or continue rebuilding the defences?"
whiteruthenia.32.a: "Further improve our defences!"

whiteruthenia.33.t: "Ostwall Anti-Tank Defences"
whiteruthenia.33.d: "Construction finished today on a new network of major anti-tank defences capable of posing a major threat to Russian armoured cavalry. The Ostwall has traditionally relied upon the outdated assumption that enemy tanks would support infantry and attack in small numbers, however modern military thinking makes clear that relying on this assumption would be foolish. An elaborate labyrinth of dragons' teeth and mines will go a long way to protecting our border. Some generals believe that we have expanded the Ostwall enough, but we could go further."
whiteruthenia.33.a: "Further improve our defences!"

whiteruthenia.34.t: "Ostwall Casement Bunkers Restored"
whiteruthenia.34.d: "Today our diligent engineers finished upgrading the various machine gun nests and bunkers along the line. New lines of fire have been created making the Ostwall far more lethal to approaching infantry and the bunkers themselves have been cased in new reinforced concrete. Shall we continue the restoration or are such fortifications sufficient?"
whiteruthenia.34.a: "Further improve our defences!"

whiteruthenia.35.t: "Ostwall Renovations Completed"
whiteruthenia.35.d: "Today restoration works on the border defences with Russia were completed, ending a long and expensive programme. A bottle of prize Ruthenian vodka was smashed against the side of the final bunker by one of our generals to much amusement. With such protection in place, our independence is secured."
whiteruthenia.35.a: "Excellent!"

whiteruthenia.37.t: "Unban the Socialists?"
whiteruthenia.37.d: "Along with last year's liberalization and the appointment of some politicians from among the Hramada to ministerial positions, the question of elections and the participation of other political parties in them that are part of the Hramada remains open. In particular, we are talking about the participation in the elections of the Party of Social Revolutionaries and independent socialists, whose views can be described as radically anti-German and anti-monarchist. The Social Revolutionaries were one of the founding parties of the nation, and its exclusion from politics was controversial - especially since its ban was part of our deal with Germany. Supporters claim that this would demonstrate the goodwill and revival of the Belarusian nation, and many others relented, saying that the syndicalists have little chance of coming to power anyway."
whiteruthenia.37.a: "What harm could it do?"
whiteruthenia.37.b: "We will not take any chances."

whiteruthenia.39.t: "The [GetYear] White Ruthenian Elections"
whiteruthenia.39.d: "With our democratic reformation complete, it is time for White Ruthenia to have its first true elections since the dissolution of the People’s Republic. Our nation has come a long way since independence, but this is truly a turning point in our fortunes!"
whiteruthenia.39.a: "Non-Partisans remains victorious!"
whiteruthenia.39.b: "Hramada wins a landslide victory!"
whiteruthenia.39.c: "Christian Democrats surprisingly win!"

whiteruthenia.40.t: "Dealing with Žyhimont"
whiteruthenia.40.d: "Žyhimont has proven an effective head of the Belarusian Military Commission and intelligence services. Unfortunately, his vocal claims to be the rightful heir to the throne and his festering resentment of his brother Uladzimir has been a constant thorn in the government's side. Given his substantial support among the nation's military and police, it is likely that he could even pose an existential threat to the current monarch and government. We may need to, at the very least, consider a renegotiation of his position."
whiteruthenia.40.a: "Negotiate with Žyhimont."
whiteruthenia.40.b: "He is no threat."

whiteruthenia.42.t: "Žyhimont Demands The Throne!"
whiteruthenia.42.d: "Žyhimont has agreed to enter negotiations but has outrageously demanded that Uladzimir immediately abdicate and surrender the crown to him. While senior officials and palace staff believed that Žyhimont would be frank with his ambitions, none supposed he would so blatantly make a grab for power like this."
whiteruthenia.42.a: "The time has come. Brother of the King will succeed our monarch."
whiteruthenia.42.e: "These demands are ridiculous!"

whiteruthenia.45.t: "Negotiations Fall Through"
whiteruthenia.45.d: "Despite our best efforts, we have failed to reach an agreement with Žyhimont and while he has not yet resigned from his positions, many suspect that he is only staying in his position to consolidate his control over the secret police. Swift action may need to be taken to prevent disaster."
whiteruthenia.45.a: "So what, he is no threat..."

whiteruthenia.46.t: "Žyhimont Leaves for Germany"
whiteruthenia.46.d: "After the news of Žyhimont's demarche was heard in Berlin, the pretender was forced to leave White Ruthenia, offered a position in one of the ministries of the Empire. However, if our sources do not lie, Žyhimont has refused the offer and instead left Germany for Guatemala in order to manage a coffee plantation he owned. "
whiteruthenia.46.a: "Best of luck in such further lands!"

whiteruthenia.47.t: "Radicals Take Power in White Ruthenia!"
whiteruthenia.47.d: "The recently deposed King of White Ruthenia Uladzimir foolishly unbanned the syndicalists, allowing them to win a surprise victory in the White Ruthenia elections! Like the fable of the Farmer and the Viper, the despicable Syndicalists have repaid Uladzimir's naive kindness by overthrowing him and exiling him from the country. Many are calling for us to intervene to restore order to White Ruthenia. After all, we cannot tolerate a Red presence in the vital Eastern regions while waging war against their compatriots to the west."
whiteruthenia.47.a: "Do not intervene."
whiteruthenia.47.b: "White Ruthenia must not fall!"

whiteruthenia.48.t: "Belarus Seeks Entry Into Our Alliance"
whiteruthenia.48.d: "Having overthrown the oppressive German monarchy and consolidated their new state, an envoy from Belarus has approached us today asking to join our alliance. A nation hostile to Germany on its vulnerable eastern flank, allied with us, would be a serious boon to our war efforts."

whiteruthenia.50.t: "[FROM.GetName] Rejects Us!"
whiteruthenia.50.d: "The [FROM.GetName] has refused our request to join the Internationale! This unfortunate outcome means that we essentially stand alone surrounded by enemies on all sides."
whiteruthenia.50.a: "It's their loss!"

whiteruthenia.51.t: "Belarus Asks To Join The Intermarium"
whiteruthenia.51.d: "With the two new Syndicalist states of Eastern Europe joined together in alliance, Belarus has now also asked to join us. Together we will make up a solid power bloc able to defend the interests of the workers in the East."
whiteruthenia.51.a: "Of course!"
whiteruthenia.51.b: "It's too much trouble."

whiteruthenia.52.t: "Poland Accepts Us!"

whiteruthenia.58.t: "Russia Accepts Our Claims!"
whiteruthenia.58.d: "Against all odds the Russians have accepted our claims and handed over the territories to us! The Ruthenian nation now embraces far more of our rightful historic territory!"
whiteruthenia.58.a: "Am I dreaming?"

whiteruthenia.59.t: "Russia Refuses Our Claims!"
whiteruthenia.59.d: "Predictably the Russians have refused our claims and have mocked our threats of war, what shall we do?"

whiteruthenia.59.b: "They underestimate us at their own cost!"

whiteruthenia.63.t: "Intervention in the Russian Civil War"
whiteruthenia.63.d: "Today while the socialist rebels were distracted fighting Russia, forward units of our army entered the border regions and occupied them. With the civil war raging on our government can now try to use the weakness of the Russian socialist regime to recover our claims."
whiteruthenia.63.a: "We should occupy it as soon as possible."

whiteruthenia.64.t: "[WHR.GetName] Demands Socialist Territory!"
whiteruthenia.64.d: "Using our distraction fighting the reactionary Russian government the White Ruthenians are attempting to seize the territory that they claim is rightfully theirs!"

whiteruthenia.70.b: "So be it! To war!"

whiteruthenia.71.t: "[WHR.GetName] Seeks Support"
whiteruthenia.71.d: "The White Ruthenian government, after recently claiming Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to be their rightful territories, have come to us to request our support in pressuring to cede these lands to [WHR.GetName]. As [WHR.GetName] is a part of the Reichspakt we have a duty to at least consider their request. How shall we reply?"
whiteruthenia.71.a: "Back them up."
whiteruthenia.71.b: "Decline their request."

whiteruthenia.72.t: "The Reichspakt Demands Territory!"
whiteruthenia.72.d: "The White Ruthenians, backed up by their German masters, have demanded that we hand over Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to them! While we could likely fend off the White Ruthenians, the influence of Germany makes this situation far more dire for us."
whiteruthenia.72.a: "We have no choice."
whiteruthenia.72.b: "Never!"

whiteruthenia.73.t: "They Refuse Demands!"
whiteruthenia.73.d: "They have refused our demands to transfer Gomel and Brest-Litvosk to [WHR.GetName]. Our envoy was laughed all the way out of their country, and eyes across Europe are watching events with keen interest."
whiteruthenia.73.a: "Let us pull back."
whiteruthenia.73.b: "We shall take it by force!"

whiteruthenia.74.t: "Germany Refuses To Assist!"
whiteruthenia.74.d: "Unfortunately the Germans have refused our request to pressure them into returning our rightful lands!"
whiteruthenia.74.a: "Damn!"

whiteruthenia.75.t: "[WHR.GetName] Seeks Support"
whiteruthenia.75.d: "The White Ruthenian government, after recently claiming Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to be their rightful territories, have come to us to request our support in pressuring to cede these lands to [WHR.GetName]. As a junior partner in our alliance we should at least consider helping them out. How shall we reply?"
whiteruthenia.75.a: "Russia and [WHR.GetName] should act as one."
whiteruthenia.75.b: "Decline their request."

whiteruthenia.76.t: "Russia and [WHR.GetName] Demands Land!"
whiteruthenia.76.d: "The White Ruthenians, backed up by their Russian allies, have demanded that we hand over Brest-Litvosk and Gomel to them! While we could likely fend off the White Ruthenians, the influence of a powerful Russia makes this situation far more dire for us."
whiteruthenia.76.a: "We have no choice..."
whiteruthenia.76.b: "Never!"

whiteruthenia.77.t: "They Refuse Demands!"
whiteruthenia.77.d: "They have refused our demands to transfer Gomel and Brest-Litvosk to [WHR.GetName]."
whiteruthenia.77.a: "Let us pull back."
whiteruthenia.77.b: "Then we shall take it by force!"

whiteruthenia.78.t: "Russia Refuses To Assist!"
whiteruthenia.78.d: "Unfortunately the Russians have refused our request to pressure them into returning our rightful lands!"
whiteruthenia.78.a: "Damn!"

whiteruthenia.79.t: "Urbanising [WHR.GetName]"
whiteruthenia.79.d: "The countryside of [WHR.GetName] has one of the smallest population densities in Europe, with a large number of cities being populated more by the Jewish minority than our own people. If [WHR.GetName] is to begin to develop a modern economy and industrialise, it is essential that our farmers are encouraged to settle in the cities. Unfortunately, the cost of promoting this migration as well as the cost of building new housing for the migrating residents could be expensive and take a long time to complete."
whiteruthenia.79.a: "We can take our time."
whiteruthenia.79.b: "Put some emphasis on this."
whiteruthenia.79.c: "Urbanisation must be an absolute priority."

whiteruthenia.80.t: "Urbanisation Policy Shows Results"
whiteruthenia.80.d: "After many months of encouraging urbanisation and settlement into [WHR.GetName]'s major towns, our efforts are finally beginning to bear fruit. Town centres that had been relatively bereft of life since the Tsarist period are now booming with life and civic institutions are gaining strength. Our industry has already begun to benefit from the influx of new workers."
whiteruthenia.80.a: "The process is underway."

whiteruthenia.81.t: "Urbanisation Policy Succeeds!"
whiteruthenia.81.d: "After years of hard work our efforts in encouraging White Ruthenians to move to the cities have finally paid off, and our economy has massively improved as a result. This will no doubt greatly aid in encouraging foreign investment and alleviating the effects of Black Monday."
whiteruthenia.81.a: "Finally!"

whiteruthenia.82.t: "Encouraging Industrialisation"
whiteruthenia.82.d: "For a long time [WHR.GetName] has lacked industry, receiving little investment from the Tsarist state prior to the Weltkrieg and treated with benign neglect by the Reichspakt system. To make matters worse much of what Russian industry there was began to fall into disrepair as a result of the Weltkrieg and collapse of the Russian Empire, with German companies taking their place. With Black Monday causing immense damage to said German industries, it is clear that [WHR.GetName] must begin to stand on its own two feet industrially."
whiteruthenia.82.a: "We can afford some more funding."
whiteruthenia.82.b: "[WHR.GetName] must embrace the Industrial Revolution!"
whiteruthenia.82.c: "Let's not spend too much."

whiteruthenia.83.t: "Mechanised Farming Reform"
whiteruthenia.83.d: "With the progress of technology, farming methods have already begun to improve with inventions like tractors allowing us to produce yields far in excess of what was possible previously. Despite these improvements, [WHR.GetName] remains distinctly backwards and its farming is rather inefficient by modern standards. It is clear that things must be improved if [WHR.GetName] is to take its place in the world as a modern nation."
whiteruthenia.83.a: "There's no need for a huge effort."
whiteruthenia.83.b: "Some focus on mechanisation is ideal."
whiteruthenia.83.c: "Farming must be completely mechanised!"

whiteruthenia.84.t: "Improving Rural Infrastructure"
whiteruthenia.84.d: "In many places the roads of the White Ruthenian countryside are extremely outdated and pretty much all of them date back to Tsarist-era Russia. There is minimal paving outside of the capital and most villages are connected only by terrible dirt tracks - an issue that has plagued military planners for years. It is clear that something must be done about this if we are to become a modern nation."
whiteruthenia.84.a: "Only limited funding is needed."
whiteruthenia.84.b: "Improve some of the worst offenders."
whiteruthenia.84.c: "The road network must be completely improved!"

whiteruthenia.85.t: "Clearing Pripyat Marshes"
whiteruthenia.85.d: "The clearing of portions of the Pripyat marshes is now set to begin. Although the Pripyat marshes are vast and a major attempt to clear them is beyond our abilities even a limited clearance would still benefit our nation in providing new land for agriculture or industry."
whiteruthenia.85.a: "Let us begin."

whiteruthenia.86.t: "Pripyat Marshes Drained!"
whiteruthenia.86.d: "The draining of the marshes has finally come to an end with thousands of square miles of new land having been created for agriculture and industry. Already these areas are coming to be populated by migrants from elsewhere in the country willing to set up farms on the reclaimed marshland. No doubt this will aid our nation in the long run."
whiteruthenia.86.a: "Finally!"

whiteruthenia.87.t: "The Creation of BelAZ"
whiteruthenia.87.d: "We have decided to implement our plans for the creation of BelAZ, a manufacturer capable of building various variants of vehicles and machinery at our direction depending on the needs of the state. While heavily funding the programme would be expensive and politically risky, it could undoubtedly pay off in the long run by boosting peripheral sectors and supply chains and it would greatly aid the White Ruthenian economy."
whiteruthenia.87.a: "Invest a bit into BelAZ."
whiteruthenia.87.b: "Give BelAZ a lot of funding."
whiteruthenia.87.c: "BelAZ shall become one of Eastern Europe's greatest manufacturers!"

whiteruthenia.88.t: "The Priorities of BelAZ"
whiteruthenia.88.d: "As a state-owned company, BelAZ is under our complete control - and as such it is up to the government to decide what it should concentrate on constructing. What should we have BelAZ focus on?"
whiteruthenia.88.a: "Agriculture."
whiteruthenia.88.b: "Military vehicles."
whiteruthenia.88.c: "Mining."
whiteruthenia.88.e: "Construction."

whiteruthenia.89.t: "Promoting Literacy"
whiteruthenia.89.d: "Despite the efforts of the late King Heinrich, illiteracy is still a major problem in part due to the bickering between proponents of different alphabets for the Belarusian language. While we agree that eliminating illiteracy should be a priority, the question is how much we are willing to invest to this end."
whiteruthenia.89.a: "Slow and steady wins the race."
whiteruthenia.89.b: "This issue demands much attention."
whiteruthenia.89.c: "This must be a major priority!"

whiteruthenia.90.t: "Literacy Improves"
whiteruthenia.90.d: "Thanks to our effort the literacy rate of [WHR.GetName] has finally begun to improve, however we are not finished yet."
whiteruthenia.90.a: "The end is in sight."

whiteruthenia.91.t: "Further Improvements In Literacy!"
whiteruthenia.91.d: "Thanks to our efforts illiteracy is no longer a rampant problem in [WHR.GetName], and the vast majority of the population is now able to read and write. This is a staggering success considering the agrarian and rural nature of the nation."
whiteruthenia.91.a: "Fantastic!"

whiteruthenia.92.t: "Ethanol Fuel Research"
whiteruthenia.92.d: "To compensate for [WHR.GetName]'s lack of resources needed to benefit our industry, we have decided to begin the mass-production of ethanol fuel. The question is, how much funding should we put into the research for its creation?"
whiteruthenia.92.a: "There is no need to waste a huge amount of money."
whiteruthenia.92.b: "Give them some funding, it is important."
whiteruthenia.92.c: "Fuel is essential for our industry."

whiteruthenia.93.t: "Ethanol Fuel Breakthrough"
whiteruthenia.93.d: "Thanks to our funding, the research for ethanol fuel has had a breakthrough, allowing limited production of fuel to begin. While research will continue, this is a great day for a fuel-independent [WHR.GetName]!"
whiteruthenia.93.a: "Our industry is fueled at last!"

whiteruthenia.94.t: "Ethanol Fuel Complete!"
whiteruthenia.94.d: "Though it took a while our research into the production of ethanol fuel is complete! Now we can fuel our industry despite our lack of resources."
whiteruthenia.94.a: "Great!"

whiteruthenia.95.t: "Defending Our Airspace"
whiteruthenia.95.d: "Our project to build anti-air guns in order to protect the skies of [WHR.GetName] from foreign invaders has begun and some are already being installed at this moment. Despite this, there are some officials that have proposed that we invest more into this project in order to protect our fragile growing industry from conflict."
whiteruthenia.95.a: "Some more anti-air guns would be ideal."
whiteruthenia.95.b: "[WHR.GetName] must be well protected from harm!"
whiteruthenia.95.c: "The current amount is sufficient."

whiteruthenia.96.t: "Russians Acclimatise To Our Rule"
whiteruthenia.96.d: "While there was some resistance at first from the Russian population in the lands we took from Russia, they have begun to realise their resistance is futile and accept our rule."
whiteruthenia.96.a: "Great!"

whiteruthenia.97.t: "Ukrainians Acclimatise To Our Rule"
whiteruthenia.97.d: "While there was some resistance at first from the Ukrainian population in the lands we took from Ukraine, they have begun to realise their resistance is futile and accept our rule."
whiteruthenia.97.a: "Great!"

whiteruthenia.98.t: "Black Monday Overcome!"
whiteruthenia.98.d: "After years of economic malaise due to Black Monday the actions of the government have brought an end to the crisis in [WHR.GetName] and our economy is reaching a level of success we have never seen before. It is truly a new era for our young nation."
whiteruthenia.98.a: "Finally!"

whiteruthenia.99.t: "Russia Declares War"
whiteruthenia.99.d: "With our separation from Germany and embrace of socialism, Russia has suddenly declared war upon us. Though we have our back against the wall, we must face down the great Russian bear or die trying."
whiteruthenia.99.a: "Like David against Goliath..."

whiteruthenia.100.t: "[WHR.GetName] asks for increased Self-Governance"
whiteruthenia.100.d: "A communiqué from the government of the Ruthenian King Waldemar I von Hohenzollern has requested more autonomy in their economic policy. They justify this both by claiming it will easen the burden of their still growing economy on the recovering German one, and that it will make their own, shaky government appear more legitimate."
whiteruthenia.100.a: "Dire times afford sacrifices."
whiteruthenia.100.b: "In no way, shape or form shall such a thing occur."

whiteruthenia.101.t: "Germany grants us limited Autonomy"
whiteruthenia.101.d: "The German Government has allowed us self-determination in all things economic."
whiteruthenia.101.a: "Towards a better [WHR.GetName]."

whiteruthenia.102.t: "Germany has denied our Request."
whiteruthenia.102.d: "The German Government has declined to easen the grip on our economy. In countrary, they seem to be planning to strengthen it."
whiteruthenia.102.a: "We will have our independence in time."

whiteruthenia.1000.t: "Dark Clouds Over Minsk"
whiteruthenia.1000.d: "Dark clouds and unsure winds surround the glorious state of [WHR.GetName] - a land long shackled along with its people to the will of the Kaiser. Black Monday has sent tremors throughout Mitteleuropa and the wider world, strangling our infantile economy as it tried to limp on and prosper after the horrors of the Weltkrieg. Under King Waldemar, or Uladzimir as our people still call him, we have drifted along behind our new masters with little to show for it other than a monarchy hated by the masses and an economy in complete ruin. \n\nSince before the arrival of the Germans to these lands, Republican agitation had long been on the rise under the harsh boot of the Russians, and now with the German-backed monarchy as unpopular as ever, the lands of the ‘Little Russians’ have once again seen a massive spike in the people’s desire for a say in their government. Now various groups have used the rigors of Black Monday to finally turn the tide against the Monarchy. \n\nHowever, the new government has decided to leave the Reichspakt, and now our General Staff is approaching the ministers in order to know, if [WHR.GetName] should be rightfully returned to the pact."
whiteruthenia.1000.a: "Their decisions were illegal, White Ruthenia shall be restored."
whiteruthenia.1000.b: "The people of White Ruthenia have spoken, how can we resist their will?"

whiteruthenia.1001.t: "A New System?"
whiteruthenia.1001.d: "With the Hramada seizing power, the question on everyone’s mind is what will happen next. For over a decade King Uladzimir has sat on his throne - a Hohenzollern in a foreign land, reviled by his own people, sitting in decadence as his new nation rots around him under his inefficient rule and the collaborationist Conservative parties.\n\nNow the Hramada is left with a choice - what to do with the Crown and its current holder.\n\nIn a somewhat shocking turn of events Jazep Ljosik, the leader of the right-wing of the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party outlined a proposal which would see the current monarch keep his title, yet relinquish any power to shape the course of the nation. Such a compromise would help to convince at least some of the German businesses inside Belarus to not flee in utter panic, and more importantly it would minimize the risk of drawing the ire of the Kaiser. The King would serve as the main liaison with foreign powers and most importantly keep the Reichspakt off our backs. Under this arrangement, the BSDP would tacitly work within the parliament under the Crown to create a unified Belarus, somewhat akin to how the German SPD is willing to participate in a government under the Kaiser. Alternatively, the rest of the Hramda could easily overpower Ljosik's faction and simply cast out the King, potentially earning the wrath of the Kaiser, but also be free to create a truly Socialist Belarus. What shall their final decision be?"
whiteruthenia.1001.a: "Jazep Ljosik and Ulazdimir shall work together!"
whiteruthenia.1001.b: "Are they insane? Throw this spoiled Hun out of here!"

whiteruthenia.1002.t: "Invite to the Union of People's Crowns"
whiteruthenia.1002.d: "In the various lands of the world, Monarcho-Socialism has begun to catch on, more then any expected. This is so much the case, that an international coalation, dubbed the Union of People's Crowns has been founded. Seeking to unite all Monarcho-Socialists, the leadership of the faction has approched our government, and has requested that our nation join their ranks."
whiteruthenia.1002.a: "We shall join our brothers at once!"
whiteruthenia.1002.b: "Bah! Monarcho-Socialism is only workable nationally, not internationally!"

whiteruthenia.1005.t: "A Proposal for the Survival of the Kingdom"
whiteruthenia.1005.d: "Against all odds, the people of White Ruthenia have voted to abolish the monarchy and restore the long-dead Republic. This comes most shockingly to Prince Žyhimont, brother of the King, who had ensured his brother at every possible turn that the Kingdom would survive. The prince himself, never one to shy away from direct action, has come to his brother with a plan to ensure our very survival. In brief, Žyhimont explained how a Republic would do nothing but bring ruin both within Belarus, but within the great Germanic sphere which White Ruthenia finds itself in the middle of. To solve this, all Uladzimir would have to do would be to declare the referendum invalid and dissolve the already powerless Rada, and he could save his Kingdom. While such a move would obviously be unpopular, Žyhimont has assured Uladzimir that the NBP stands ready against any insurrection. Seemingly completely certain that his brother will follow his lead, Žyhimont has already prepared the nessary paperwork for the king, all that remains is for his signature..."
whiteruthenia.1005.a: "Žyhimont is right... a Republic would be the death of Belarus!"
whiteruthenia.1005.b: "This isn't right... the people have spoken."

whiteruthenia.1006.t: "Republican Uprising!"
whiteruthenia.1006.d: "As was feared, the people have not taken kindly to the dissolution of their one means of political representation, nor the complete dismissal of the referendum. All throughout White Ruthenia, unorganized masses of peasants, workers, and even members of the middle class, have risen up against our continue rule. Just as Žyhimont promised, his NBP has been able to easily crush the vast majority of these revolts, with one crucial exception. The uprising within our capital of Minsk, unlike most other revolts, seemingly has a massive amount of organizational support.  Be it the way a general strike was declared hours before the uprising proper, or the arrival of BPSR partisans, the Minsk uprising clearly has backing towards it. As of now, the fighting is still ongoing, and control over the city is still hotly contested. If the city does indeed fall, it would mean that the nation itself would have fallen, due to the centralized nature of our state. As for King Uladzimir, in an attempt to save himself, has secured himself and his family with in the city, at an unknown location. What's more, in the midst of the fighting, Žyhimont is said to be commanding the loyalist forces from a fortified compound outside the city, potentially meaning that a counterattack could take place if the city does fall..."
whiteruthenia.1006.a: "The City Garrison is able to hold on! Long Live the Kingdom!"
whiteruthenia.1006.b: "Minsk has fallen! Long Live the Republic!"

Some moderates in our ruling leftist coalition believe that turning our back on the Monarchy, despite our Republican stance, would further divide the nation in what seems to be its darkest hour, and so many have proposed for us to allow the King to continue to reside on his Throne as a constitutional monarch with ceremonial powers bound by the constitution and the people's will. What side shall win out in this debate, however, is still unknown, but a decision must be made soon."

Unlike the extremists of the far-left and far-right the idea is to be entirely voluntary rather than forced upon the poor peasants."
WHR_health_care: "Create a National Health Care System"
WHR_health_care_desc: "Our next programme is the replacement of our current private health care system with a national publicly-funded one. By doing this we would allow all of our citizens to have adequate health care rather than simply those who can afford it."
WHR_social_market: "A Social Market Economy"
WHR_social_market_desc: "Instead of a purely capitalist system, we must set about on the creation of a third alternative between capitalism and socialism, a social market economy which will combine a free market capitalist economy with social policies that shall establish fair competition within the market."
WHR_government_tradeunions: "Government Trade Unions"
WHR_government_tradeunions_desc: "Despite many of our nation's founders being socialists, trade unions were viciously repressed following the rise of King Hienry. Now it is time to finally cease their repression and recognise the legitimacy of the trade unions, provided they stay loyal to the government of course."
WHR_encourage_investment: "Encourage Foreign Investment"
WHR_encourage_investment_desc: "Currently our country lacks industry despite our current attempts. Perhaps by taking certain measures in promoting capitalism and the free market we can encourage foreign companies to base themselves in [ROOT.GetNameDef], although such measures may be expensive and possibly unpopular among the people."
WHR_economic_boom: "Harness The Boom"
WHR_economic_boom_desc: "Our free market reforms have worked and our economy is finally beginning to boom. The days of [ROOT.GetNameDef] being an overlooked and undeveloped province of Poland and Russia shall finally come to an end."

WHR_paramilitaries: "Expand the NBP"
WHR_paramilitaries_desc: "Our coup d'etat and and disbanding of the Rada has created a lot of anger and militancy across the countries from our political enemies. If we are to maintain stability the NBP must be expanded and reorganised into paramilitary units."
WHR_BR: "Side With Belaya Rus"
WHR_BR_desc: "Despite our former alliance with extremist Belarusian nationalists, we cannot trust the crypto-syndicalist rabble to run the country. We must align ourselves with the pro-Russian elites if national order and stability is to be maintained."
WHR_BNSP: "Alliance with the BNSP"
WHR_BNSP_desc: "The BNSP, formed by extremist Belarusian nationalists Fabijan Akinčyc and Uladzislaŭ Kazloŭski, has been one of Žyhimont's main co-conspirators and supporters in the takeover of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. By allying with them we can gain the support of the people for our new regime and build [ROOT.GetNameDef] into a strong nation, never to be exploited again."
WHR_peoples_self-help: "Belarusian People's Self-Help"
WHR_peoples_self-help_desc: "To promote our alliance with sympathetic centre-right groups we shall create the Belarusian People's Self-Help, a patriotic organisation with control over culture, education, health and socio-conomical projects. It shall help us build and foster our new fair society."

WHR_persecute_minorities_desc: "For a long time the lands of [ROOT.GetNameDef] have been defiled by foreign invaders such as the Jews, who even make up a good amount of our capital's population, and the Islamic Tatars. We must awaken our people to the threat they possess and begin to persecute them so as to finally drive them out of our country."
WHR_collectivisation: "Collectivisation"
WHR_collectivisation_desc: "White Ruthenian agriculture remains inefficient and backwards with many farms not producing enough to feed the population. The clear solution is this is the compulsory unification of individual farms into collective state-run farms that will be able to feed the nation."
WHR_foreign_intelligence: "Establish a Foreign Intelligence Branch"
WHR_foreign_intelligence_desc: "Now that we have consolidated our regime at home and expanded the NBP, we can begin the creation of a foreign intelligence unit that will allow us to spy on and collect information from other nations, allowing us to stay one step ahead of the rest."

WHR_new_regime_desc: "All remains of the incompetent reigns of Hienry and Uladzimir have been swept away into the dustbin of history! Now a new era has begun for [ROOT.GetNameDef] under the glorious reign of King Žyhimont of Hohenzollern!"
WHR_national_question: "The National Question"
WHR_national_question_desc: "Although we have secured our independence, our country's nationalists still remain divided on where we should look towards for a greater Belarusian identity. White Ruthenians have strong connections to the Baltics, once even being known as Litwins due to their Lithuanian ways, as well to the Slavs of Ukraine and Russia."
WHR_latin: "Adopt The Latin Alphabet"
WHR_latin_desc: "We must look to the Baltics and Poland for our cultural identity and officially adopt a Latin script for the Belarusian language. While much of our current literature and teaching is in Cyrillic it should not take long for us to adapt."
WHR_cyrillic: "Adopt The Cyrillic Alphabet"
WHR_cyrillic_desc: "We must look to our Slavic heritage, and officially adopt Cyrillic as the script of our language. After all, much of our literature and teaching is already written in this script."
WHR_unity: "Embrace Multi-Lingualism"
WHR_unity_desc: "Instead of alienating many by choosing one script over another, the best solution would be to officially recognise and teach both alphabets and accept our mixed Baltic and Slavic heritage. While this may strain our nation in the short-term in the long-term it will help unify our people and make [ROOT.GetNameDef] into a stronger whole."
WHR_orthodox: "An Orthodox State"
WHR_orthodox_desc: "Orthodox Christianity is the largest religion in [ROOT.GetNameDef] and followed by the majority of our people, we must ensure that the Orthodox Church has a special role in the foundations and running of the nation, which will help to secure their loyalty."
WHR_secular: "A Secular State"
WHR_secular_desc: "Although the majority of our population is Orthodox there are still many of other religions, including Catholics, Jews and Muslims. It would be harmful to our nation and its stability to alienate many of our population. Instead we must ensure that no religion is promoted above others."
WHR_belarusian_youth_union: "Belarusian Youth Union"
WHR_belarusian_youth_union_desc: "We must create the Belarusian Youth Union, inspired by similar youth organisations across the world, to promote traditional values and patriotism as well as train our children in a variety of skills so that they may be stronger and fitter to serve their country when they come of age."
WHR_jewish_autonomism: "Jewish Autonomism"
WHR_jewish_autonomism_desc: "Our nation contains a significant amount of Jews. Now that we have embarked on a path of secularism and acceptance of all religions, we could offer the Jews political and cultural autonomy which would allow them to prosper and aid our nation."
WHR_ethnic_assimilation: "Ethnic Assimilation"
WHR_ethnic_assimilation_desc: "After much debate we have finally decided upon and have begun to create a greater Belarusian identity. Despite the early birth of our national identity, the Belarusian people are ready to fight and die to defend their nation at all costs."
WHR_state_assimilation: "State Assimilation"
WHR_state_assimilation_desc: "[ROOT.GetName] is a multicultural nation, its people being Balts, Slavs, Jews and Tatars, united in a White Ruthenian identity. Our nation shall not be based on ethnicity, but on civic nationalism."
WHR_national_army: "The National Army"
WHR_national_army_desc: "The White Ruthenian National Army, formed by Konstantin Ezovitov at the end of the Weltkrieg has gradually fallen victim to reductions in size as a result of economic problems and a reliance on Germany. If [ROOT.GetNameDef] is to stand on its own two feet as a country it must have a strong and independent military ready to defend the nation."
WHR_mobility: "The Doctrine of Mobility"
WHR_mobility_desc: "Speed is everything in modern warfare. By ensuring our troops are always faster than the enemy we can ensure that any war in which we are involved will take place on foreign soil and preserve our manpower."
WHR_motorise_cavalry: "Motorise the Cavalry"
WHR_motorise_cavalry_desc: "Since our independence our military has placed a strong emphasis on cavalry. By beginning to motorise and mechanise our armies we will keep our military up-to-date with the present day while still preserving our tactical advantage."
WHR_tank_research: "Tank Research"

WHR_firepower: "The Doctrine of Firepower"
WHR_firepower_desc: "If we are to defend ourselves in war our armies cannot afford to simply rely on a swift victory. If we should get bogged down the firepower of artillery must be able to scatter our enemies and preserve the lives of our men."
WHR_munitions: "Ruthenian Munitions"
WHR_munitions_desc: "At the current time [ROOT.GetNameDef] lacks a major domestic arms industry, relying on others for guns and ammunition. If our military is to prosper we must begin to research the manufacture of weapons so that our nation will not need to rely on foreign arms."
WHR_artillery_research: "Artillery Research"

WHR_instil_patriotism_desc: "Due to our troubles in creating a national identity to look to and with which to unify our people there is currently little enthusiasm among the population to serve in the military or to fight for their country. We must begin a mass propaganda campaign to rectify this."
WHR_support_technology: "Supporting Our Troops"
WHR_support_technology_desc: "While guns and ammunition of course take priority for our troops, we shouldn't overlook the value of supporting equipment such as radios, field hospitals, artillery and other supporting equipment that helps to strengthen our army."
WHR_officer_school: "Establish an Officer School"
WHR_officer_school_desc: "Currently our nation lacks an officer school, limiting the quality and training of our officers. If we establish an officer school in preparation for the defence of our country it would aid us in training qualified civilians to become officers in the White Ruthenian army."
WHR_exempt_scientists: "Exempt Scientists from Conscription"
WHR_exempt_scientists_desc: "Currently much scientific potential is wasted in mandatory military service. By offering prominent scientists and other intellectuals an alternative to military service we could help bolster our nation's technological capabilities and research."
WHR_defend_ruthenia: "Defending the Nation"
WHR_defend_ruthenia_desc: "While Europe has enjoyed a decade and a half of peace following the end of the Weltkrieg it is clear world tensions are growing and that it is only a matter of time until Europe is embroiled in war once more.

WHR_home_defence: "Form the Ruthenian Home Defence"
WHR_home_defence_desc: "If [ROOT.GetNameDef] is to be militarily effective in the face of a war we must focus on the homefront.

WHR_green_oak: "Reactivate Green Oak"
WHR_green_oak_desc: "Some of our generals have proposed the research and creation of special mountaineer units to fight the enemy. The name they have proposed for these special units will be "Green Oak", named after a White Ruthenian guerrilla organisation formed towards the end of the Weltkrieg."

WHR_equipment_production: "Maximize Equipment Production"
WHR_equipment_production_desc: "If [ROOT.GetNameDef] is to have a proper army, the production of weaponry and equipment, and the breeding of horses must increase. This combined with a promotion of cavalry training should hopefully encourage new recruits to join and defend the nation."
WHR_cavalry_speed: "Speed Cult"
WHR_cavalry_speed_desc: "Our nation lacks manpower and cannot afford to be bogged down in a repeat of the Weltkrieg. If [ROOT.GetNameDef] is to be a victorious nation in any future conflict, the emphasis of its army must be on speed and a quick victory to any wars in which it is embroiled."
WHR_air_force: "The Ruthenian Air Force"
WHR_air_force_desc: "Despite the many air bases already built in our country with the help of the Germans we have very few planes in our air force as a result of their cost being deemed too much for our poor economy. If we are to defend our country from the air this must begin to change."
WHR_fighters: "Procure Fighter Designs"
WHR_fighters_desc: "Should it come to war the White Ruthenian air force should be focused on defending the skies above [ROOT.GetNameDef] and its allies from invading planes. The fragile White Ruthenian infrastructure and economy could certainly not take a mass bombing campaign."
WHR_anti-air: "Develop Anti-Air Defences"
WHR_anti-air_desc: "Due to [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s current economic weakness industrially and in terms of infrastructure, allowing enemy bombers to get through could cause serious damage to the nation. The building of anti-air defences must be a priority in order to prevent this possibility."
WHR_radar: "Radar Technology"
WHR_radar_desc: "Foresight and strategic advantages are everything in war, in the air as well as on land or at sea. By building radars we can stay one step ahead of any enemy planes."

WHR_repair_facility: "Establish a Repair Facility"

WHR_aviation_fuel: "Direct Injection Fuel Systems"
WHR_aviation_fuel_desc: "The concept of a direct injection fuel system has been around since its invention by the Swedish engineer Jonas Hesselman. By implementing direct injection fuel systems into our planes we could help prevent stalling durig the process of high speed aerial manoeuvres."

WHR_black_cats: "Expand the Black Cats"
WHR_black_cats_desc: "The loyal Belarusian nationalist and guerrilla expert Michał Vituška and his 'Blacks Cats' units proved to be effective in the tasks entrusted to them. We should expand their numbers and allocate more funds to them, especially in the field of Paratrooper, to further improve our proud army."

### Initial Uladzimir Focuses ###
 WHR_Waldemar: "Uladzimir on the Throne"
 WHR_Waldemar_desc: "While the political system of [ROOT.GetNameDef] is constitutionally nearly identical to the German system, the current King Uladzimir prefers to leave the day-to-day governing to the current head of government. Vasil Zacharka. Appointed by his father seemingly to spite the social democrat domanined Rada, Zacharka essentially has free reign of the country. If we truly wish to get out of this dark age, this state of affairs simply will not do."
 WHR_democracy: "Reforms In The Kingdom"
 WHR_democracy_desc: "It is clear that on account of his illness and disinterest in day-to-day rule Uladzimir is perhaps unfit to rule as an absolutist King. However, instead of giving into Žyhimont's demands, the answer clearly lies in reforming the nation into a fully constitutional monarchy and fully restoring the democracy of the original Belarusian republic."
 WHR_unban_left: "The Hramada Question"
 WHR_unban_left_desc: "Now that we have begun to step towards returning to democracy, we must decide if the Syndicalist parties should remain banned or not. While weak and lacking support, they could still constitute a significant threat if allowed to proliferate legally and stand in elections."
 WHR_liberalise_press: "Liberalise the Press"
 WHR_liberalise_press_desc: "In the past our press was carefully examined and anything criticising our regime or the German Empire censored. It is time to reform this so that newspapers and people of all opinions and politics may have a say."
 WHR_disband_secret: "Disband the NBP"
 WHR_disband_secret_desc: "While Uladzimir's popularity has begun to increase among the people following our reforms, Žyhimont and his supporters in the NBP secret police remain a major threat to the new government. It is time to disband the secret police and arrest Žyhimont himself if it comes to that."

 WHR_elections: "Call New Elections"
 WHR_elections_desc: "Now that all threats to our new democracy have been eliminated, it is time for [ROOT.GetNameDef] to finally hold its first ever truly free elections since the fall of the People’s Republic."

 WHR_authoritarian: "Flex Royal Prerogatives"
 WHR_authoritarian_desc: "To say that [ROOT.GetNameDef] is in crisis would be an understatement, and while many claim this is due to the lack of bending to the people’s will, others claim it comes from a lack of use of the Royal Prerogative granted by our Prussian-style constitution to King Uladzimir. If Uladzimir truly wishes to see the nation reborn, he must flex his muscles so to speak, perhaps finally shutting up the Rada for good. "
 WHR_special_courts: "Establish Special Courts"
 WHR_special_courts_desc: "In spite of our best efforts syndicalists, pro-Russians and other enemies of the state still run rampant. It is clear that the NBP need to increase their operations, starting with secret trials of those whose opinions we deem unacceptable."
 WHR_censor_press: "Extend Press Censorship"
 WHR_censor_press_desc: "Even with our current censorship, our enemies have still been able to secretly spread their ideals in many of the popular newspapers. We must begin to strictly dictate what content newspapers are to publish and ban those who refuse to conform."
 WHR_sigismund_negotiations: "The Position of Žyhimont"
 WHR_sigismund_negotiations_desc: "Despite Uladzimir's recent show of strength his resentful brother Žyhimont still claims himself the rightful king of [ROOT.GetNameDef], and is amassing a number of supporters throughout all branches of government. This problem must be dealt with one way or another as soon as possible, as every more minute wasted gives Žyhimont more time to plot."

### BNP Monarchy Focuses ###
 WHR_BNP: "The Non-Partisans Remain"
 WHR_BNP_desc: "The Non-Partisan Bloc is formed from those who chose to stay loyal to Germany following the dissolving of the Belarusian People's Republic and the ascension of Genrykh I to the throne of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. Although lacking power while Genrykh was on the throne, the Rada's power greatly increased during Uladzimir's reign allowing them to maintain themselves as a major political force."
 WHR_Belorutenization: "'Weißruthenisation'"
 WHR_Belorutenization_desc: "To alleviate the poor national cohesion our subjects have we shall forge a new identity for them.

 WHR_Khutor_System: "Praise the Khutar System"
 WHR_Khutor_System_desc: "Khutars are a single-homestead rural units. While some might think such settlements might pale in comparison to agrarian collectives, we know that a proud farmer working for his own independent home is far more industrious than in any other system. We should encourage continued development inside the Khutar System."
 WHR_Church_Education_2: "Bring the Churches into Education"
 WHR_Church_Education_2_desc: "Ever since Medieval times, the Church has pioneered education and enlightenment of the masses. Thanks to their effort, many scientific breakthroughs have been made. If we are to ensure Belarus is at the forefront of progress the Churches have to contribute towards the educational system."
 WHR_Modeling_Identity: "Modeling Belarusian Identity"
 WHR_Modeling_Identity_desc: "Thanks to the weakness of our identity Belarus has been dragged around by foreign powers since centuries. Our poor and pious people don't deserve such fate. That is why we must look towards the deep and rich folk culture and form a new national identity respecting our long-lived traditions."
 WHR_BIKK: "Institute of Economy and Culture"
 WHR_BIKK_desc: "With the creation of the Institute of Economy and Culture, Belarus shall have a place of education others in Eastern Europe will look with envy towards.

### BPS-F Focuses ###

 WHR_BPSF: "New Democratic Coalition"
 WHR_BPSF_desc: "Having managed to secure a majority inside the Hramada, the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists has formed a truly democratic government of like-minded parties.

 WHR_Belarus_Sovereignity_desc: "Belarus is finally free, after so many years of being shackled by the German behemoth. With our independence secured the time has finally come to start shaping our nation into a state which will satisfy every citizen. No longer will we let ourselves be exploited, we shall prosper on our own!"
 WHR_National_Revival: "National Revival"
 WHR_National_Revival_desc: "We have to come to terms with the sad fact that Belarusian identity as a thing doesn't exactly exist. It's one of the reasons why foreign powers had such an easy time subjugating us over the years. This has to change if we are to maintain a stable republic. We shall draw from great writers and artists of old to create a modern and proud identity, one that we could call our own."
 WHR_Principles_Of_Federalism: "Principles of Federalism"
 WHR_Principles_Of_Federalism_desc: "Belarus is a land of diverse peoples and cultures. To lump them all under one commanding authority would mean that unfair treatment might easily arise. Instead, we will institute a leveled system of administration with more autonomy given to various groups and states. With lesser government oversight these regions will be able to more effectively manage their own affairs and protect the rich cultural heritage of Belarusian nations."
 WHR_Rural_Education: "Rural Education"
 WHR_Rural_Education_desc: "The state of education outside the biggest cities is truly sorry. The average Belarusian peasant is sadly stuck deeply in the 16th century. We need to change that by funding a wide-reaching program of rural education and creation of village schools."

 WHR_Solve_The_Agrarian_Question_desc: "The Agrarian Question has been the bane of ordinary people of Belarus as far as anyone can remember. We cannot delay finding the solution for it any longer. A grand and ambitious plan shall be formulated to finally fix the broken state of our fair lands."
 WHR_Strengthen_The_Rada: "Strengthen the Rada"
 WHR_Strengthen_The_Rada_desc: "The Rada is the greatest institution for our great people. Filled with representatives elected by the general population, it provides a truly fair system of representation. Thus, it is only logical that the powers of the Rada should be expanded so we more effectively serve the people's will."
 WHR_Self_Reliance: "Self-Reliance Tactics"
 WHR_Self_Reliance_desc: "Taught by experiences of previous foreign oppression, we know that our economy cannot rely on outside forces to be propped up. We need to introduce various mechanics and systems into our industrial sphere to transform it into a softly autarkic state, one benefiting our people first and foremost."
 WHR_Cooperative_Economy: "Cooperative Economy"
 WHR_Cooperative_Economy_desc: "A nation needs an economy that works for all and not the few at the top. That is why we will form our new economy around the concept of cooperatives. With everybody working in tandem with each other and profiting equally from their labor they will be further motivated to even greater heights of prosperity. Hand in hand we shall make the Belarusian economy the greatest in the world!"
 WHR_Oppose_Hramada: "Oppose Hramada"
 WHR_Oppose_Hramada_desc: "Unfortunately for us and our great people, the socialist Hramada has turned out to be nothing more than a bunch of blinded radicals. Despite so many successful changes introduced by our government, they have gone into total opposition towards us, calling us petty bourgeoisie. We have to deal with them if we are to continue our great mission."
 WHR_Calm_The_Left_2: "Calm the Left"
 WHR_Calm_The_Left_2_desc: "While the more socialist members of the Hramada have started to feel uneasy with how moderate our reforms might seem, they need not worry. Our main aim is to ensure that Belarus' society is fair and equal for every single one of its members. In that, we align with the Left of Hramada and shall continue the fruitful cooperation with them."
 WHR_Nationalization: "Reasonable Nationalization"
 WHR_Nationalization_desc: "Our next endeavor in reforming Belarus into a modern nation is to begin the process of nationalizing important areas of industry. While full nationalization would only bring ruin to our nation, these areas require the stability given by government control. Naturally, most of the previous owners will be compensated if they agree to our proposal."
 WHR_Nurture_Middle_Class: "Nurturing the Middle Class"
 WHR_Nurture_Middle_Class_desc: "The middle class in Belarus is rapidly rising thanks to our recent reforms. In order to ensure that they continue their support for our beautiful nation we need to actively help them. In time, they shall form the intellectual and industrial backbone of our society."

 WHR_syndicalism: "Socialize the Land"
 WHR_syndicalism_desc: "The core of our reforms is the system of Land Socialization. Though our detractors say it is merely Nationalization, that is when land belongs to the state. However, when it belongs to people, it is a far more noble and fair institution - Socialization. Private ownership of Belarus' land shall be a thing of the past, for this vast, bountiful, and beautiful expanse that we call home shall now be collectively and equally owned by the expansive Belarusian proletariat."
 WHR_bolshevik: "Embrace Bolshevism"
 WHR_bolshevik_desc: "Despite the success of the syndicalist revolutions in the west, Bolshevism remains the true revolutionary ideology of eastern nations. We must embrace our roots, a belief which was cruelly crushed by the combined reactionary forces of Germany and White Russia."
 WHR_land_confiscation: "Land Confiscations"
 WHR_land_confiscation_desc: "The peasantry of Belarus have for a long time been under the thumb of the rich kulaks and the landlords. Many of these landlords are not even Belarusians at all but in fact are of Polish descent. The peasantry of Belarus must take back their land from these robbers of the people so that we can begin to establish agricultural collectives."
 WHR_central_planning: "Central Planning"
 WHR_central_planning_desc: "While some diehard syndicalists might accuse of being merely state capitalists, an economy dictated not by syndicates or free market but by the needs of the government is the most efficient system, as even the newfound Totalist movement admits."
 WHR_recreate_police: "Recreate the Secret Police"
 WHR_recreate_police_desc: "While we revile the despicable NBP they certainly did their job in repressing dissent towards the regime. It would be both greatly beneficial and ironic for us to create a secret police of our own, this time in service of the worker and not of the capitalist exploiters."
 WHR_empower_unions: "Empower the Trade Unions"
 WHR_empower_unions_desc: "The rights of the workers and trade unions were often ruthlessly repressed by the former regime. Now that we are in power, it is time to adapt the nation to a new Syndicalist system."

 WHR_land_committes_desc: "Right now the land in the regions where it was socialized remains in a strange state of limbo without any concrete oversight.

 WHR_ties_to_russian_srs_desc: "Our humble party of Socialist-Revolutionaries comes from the same origins as the great champions of the people in Russia. Having transformed Belarus into a socialist paradise fit to stand on equal footing with our brotherly proletariat, we should reach out to the PLSR government in hopes of future cooperation."
 WHR_Transition_To_Soviet_Democracy: "Transition to Soviet Democracy"
 WHR_Transition_To_Soviet_Democracy_desc: "We have to transform our government into a truly Soviet Democracy. Instead of the state being tyrannical like in Mitteleuropa or the Entente,relying on reactionary elements of society to pull our strings like in many capitalist ‘democracies’. We have to achieve a Peoples State, one in which the people vote in elections to choose delegates who directly execute their will."
 WHR_Light_Industrialization: "Light Industrialisation"
 WHR_Light_Industrialization_desc: "Belarus cannot be satisfied with keeping the same agrarian structure forever! On the contrary, it must work on modernizing itself. Therefore, we have to start a moderate industrialization process in order to get the best results for the country and the people."

 WHR_Sieradas_Report_desc: "Jan Sierada, People's Minister for Agriculture, is to submit his report on the state of land reform within the nation to  the Rada.

 WHR_MaAV_Opening_desc: "Built with German help initially as an auto repair workshop, the Mahilou (Mogilev) Automobile Plant is to open to great acclaim. Along with repair facilities for the army, especially for German forces in the region, the expanded Plant includes the tools and machinery to begin production of agricultural tractors, making it the cornerstone of the BSDP's industrialisation program and a symbol of German-Belarusian cooperation."
 WHR_The_Assembly: "Congress of the Hramada"
 WHR_The_Assembly_desc: "Belarus' ruling coalition since the fall of the monarchy a short time ago, the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union, or Hramada, is lead by the BDSP. However, the stalling of Plan Sierada and the collapse of the German economy has shaken its unity. An emergency congress of the Hramada has been called to tackle these issues and either reel the other parties back in, or propose a new plan to the Rada."
 WHR_Status_Quo: "Begin Plan Sierada"
 WHR_Status_Quo_desc: "With the Hramada rallied back behind the moderates of the BSDP, Plan Sierada can begin with the support of the entire coalition. This will also then allow us to proceed with our other ambitious projects, from industrial expansion to education reform."
 WHR_Protect_Parliament: "Protecting the Rada's Authority"
 WHR_Protect_Parliament_desc: "The Rada is the true representative of the people. This very fact is enshrined in the constitution as the legislature represents the people's sovereignty. The threats to our young parliamentary republic have eased, further cementing our young democracy against reactionaries and autocrats."
 WHR_Solidify_identity: "Solidifying our Identity"
 WHR_Solidify_identity_desc: "Lack of a common national identity is one of the worst characteristics a nation may have. We’ve been doing many things to correct this injustice in the past 20 years. Yet there’s still much work to be done. We must continue on."
 WHR_Bundist_Ties: "Leash the Bund"
 WHR_Bundist_Ties_desc: "The Bund is growing more and more worried with our programs and may cut ties with us, we must not let that happen, we must contact the moderates, the most pro-BSDP members of the Bund, to ensure the continuation of our alliance with the Bund."
 WHR_Bund_Autonomy: "Negotiations with the Bund?"
 WHR_Bund_Autonomy_desc: "Starting chaos with our allies will achieve nothing productive, we should negotiate with the Bund leadership to hash out a deal to reinvigorate our alliance."
 WHR_Minority_Protection: "Protect Minorities"
 WHR_Minority_Protection_desc: "Despite our best efforts to bring about an equal society, the reality has been less than ideal, as even with constitutional guarantees, there remains tension between that nation's ethnic groups. We must not only have codified guarantees, but our actions must match the formalities and renew our dedication to the Personal Principle."
 WHR_Civic_Nationalism: "Promote Civic Nationalism"
 WHR_Civic_Nationalism_desc: "The formation of the Belarusian nation was not only an effort of the Belarusian people. Many minorities lent their effort to the nation building we’ve been so desperately craving for years. Therefore, we should focus on promoting a specific type of Nationalism. One that takes loyalty, freedom and equality from its citizens. Civic Nationalism."
 WHR_National_Awakening: "The National Awakening"
 WHR_National_Awakening_desc: "Our efforts bear fruit! Nowadays more people proudly identify as “Belarusian” than have at any point in history. Soon, the Belarusian nation will be recognised as a true one, equal to the Poles and Russians that once looked down on us as mere peasants and fodder for assimilation."
 WHR_Guaranteed_Liberties: "Guaranteed Liberties"
 WHR_Guaranteed_Liberties_desc: "With many threats around the world ramping up their ante, it’s quite sad to see our citizens despair about potentially losing their rights. They should fear not however, for the people of Belarus are free and they shall remain so, with all the privileges this freedom entails!"
 WHR_Expand_Rural_Education: "Expand Education to the Countryside"
 WHR_Expand_Rural_Education_desc: "Lack of education for the Peasantry has always been an incredibly potent issue for our fledgling nation. We’ve been taking steps to rectify this for years now and we shall keep doing so in the future, for education is the backbone of any modern country."

 WHR_Expand_Pedagogical_Institute: "Minsk Pedagogical Institute"
 WHR_Expand_Pedagogical_Institute_desc: "Founded as the Minsk Teachers' Training Institute in 1914, the Pedagogical Institute has proven to be one of the central pillars for Belarusian nation-building, training teachers to educate the people, young and old. In order to keep up with the massive expansion of our national education system, the Institute must be expanded to help fill the ever-increasing number of classrooms and continue the fight against illiteracy."
 WHR_Build_University: "Belarusian State University"
 WHR_Build_University_desc: "Founded in October of 1921, BSU is the foremost higher education institution in Belarus. As mentioned previously, education is the backbone of any fledging, so we’ll make sure to keep the University well-funded. The next generations are key towards Belarus’ success."
 WHR_Calm_The_Left: "Calming the Left"
 WHR_Calm_The_Left_desc: "At the start of this crisis, we rebuked the Left-wing of our party and kept going with our reformist ideals. Regardless however, we should reassure our comrades from the left. We’re all fighting for the same thing here: a Socialist Belarus, equal for all."

 WHR_BSDP_Black_Monday: "Dealing with Black Monday"
 WHR_BSDP_Black_Monday_desc: "As we are dependent on the German economy, it came to no shock that the aftershocks of Black Monday quickly reached our nation as several German firms had to close shop, leaving many Belarusians unemployed. Now that we have dealt with the land reform issue, which affects a much greater portion of our population, we can tackle this new challenge. For now, public works projects will keep our people busy as we assess the damage."
 WHR_Help_Jewish_Organizations: "Help Jewish Organisations"
 WHR_Help_Jewish_Organizations_desc: "Many urban-based Jewish organisations have been hit particularly hard by Black Monday. The Rada should divert some funds to said associations for quicker recovery. Our Bundist allies will surely appreciate that."
 WHR_Nationalize_Key_Industries: "Nationalise Key Industries"
 WHR_Nationalize_Key_Industries_desc: "The BSDP has always supported the nationalisation of some key sectors of the economy. With German firms bankrupt or pulling out, we have a good opportunity to pick up after their mess and strengthen our nation's economic position within our own country."
 WHR_Waiting_on_the_Germans: "Utilize German Wealth"
 WHR_Waiting_on_the_Germans_desc: "In spite of us taking the most appropriate measures to combat the economic crisis, it is still not enough. With Belarus’ economy being relatively weak compared to our neighbors, we must take certain drastic measures to help us push the recovery beyond the final hurdle. It's time to investigate accounts and assets of the Berlin-appointed administrators hidden in local municipalities."

 WHR_Left_Hramadists_Plan: "Left Hramadist Plan"
 WHR_Left_Hramadists_Plan_desc: "The Sierada Plan was considered too moderate for Belarusian agriculture to modernize, and the Hramada forced to choose the plan of its leftist wing, led by Taraškievič and Pryshčepaŭ."
 WHR_Belarus_Red_Denmark: "Belarus - Red Denmark!"

 WHR_Mass_Nationalization: "Mass Nationalization"
 WHR_Mass_Nationalization_desc: "The new Belarus is not a place for private property to prosper. Except for the peasants, all industry and land estates are to be nationalized in the favour of our People's Republic!"
 WHR_Support_Khutors: "Support the Khutarisation"
 WHR_Support_Khutors_desc: "The Khutars, or farms, are historical way of living for many Belarusian peasants. Instead of collectivisation, either forceful or voluntary, our government shall support the smallholders."
 WHR_Freedom_Of_Land_Tenure: "Freedom of Peasant Land Tenure"

### Coup ###
 WHR_Aftermath_Of_The_Coup: "Aftermath of the Coup"
 WHR_Aftermath_Of_The_Coup_desc: "The Army has stepped in just in time to save the country from the crypto-syndicalists of the BSDP. While the dust has barely settled in Minsk, the socialists have taken up arms to continue the fight in the countryside. To secure the nation from them and ensure that we remain free from Syndicalism, we must take a stand, for the future of the nation."
 WHR_The_New_Populist_Government: "The New Populist Government"
 WHR_The_New_Populist_Government_desc: "Formerly the opposition to the BSDP government within the powerless Rada,, the Christian Democrats and Populists of the National Democratic Association have pledged their support for the military government. Seeing the true threat the socialists pose, a unity government has been formed consisting of National Democratic representatives in the Rada and the army."
 WHR_Stop_Land_Reform: "Stop the Land Reform"
 WHR_Stop_Land_Reform_desc: "The socialists' destabilising ideological program has gone far enough. The worst excesses have long been dealt with and its continuation only serves to hurt the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, and the loyal landowners of the country."
 WHR_Restore_The_Rada: "Restructure the Rada"
 WHR_Restore_The_Rada_desc: "It is imperative that some form of representation is maintained in our republic, for we cannot ignore the plights of our people. The seats held by the BSDP have been, of course, forfeited, and those held by Lastouski's Kryvians are loyal to our anti-syndicalist cause, leaving us with a comfortable majority to legally enact laws and constitutional changes."
 WHR_Church_Education: "Bring the Churches in Education"
 WHR_Church_Education_desc: "The BSDP's insistence on purely secular education has proved to be a major roadblock for the struggling situation of our institutions. The Catholic and Orthodox churches are keen to help improve literacy among the poor peasants, the majority of the nation's population, and instil good values in them. We will solve the literacy issue much more easily and quickly by letting them organise schools again."
 WHR_Promote_Civic_Nationalism: "Promote Civic Nationalism"
 WHR_Promote_Civic_Nationalism_desc: "It is imperative that we do not betray the ideals of civic nationalism, for many minorities live in [ROOT.GetNameDef]. While continuing to improve the national awakening of the Belarusians, we cannot abandon our Polish and Russian allies in the face of the existential threat of Syndicalism."
 WHR_Formally_Ban_BSDP: "Ban the BSDP"
 WHR_Formally_Ban_BSDP_desc: "It is not enough to merely oppose the BSDP; we must ensure that they can never threat our nation ever again. As such, their party will be formally banned along with their leftist allies in the Hramada. We cannot allow crypto-syndicalists to enter our government ever again."
 WHR_National_Revolution: "The National Revolution"
 WHR_National_Revolution_desc: "It is clear that to avoid a godless Syndicalist revolution, a National one must take place to lead the nation away from leftist agitation. This is what our government represents, and we will lead the Belarusian nation towards a future free of foreign agitators."
 WHR_Puppet_Rada: "The New Rada"
 WHR_Puppet_Rada_desc: "When the Republic was refounded, a strict parliamentary system was put in place. However, with a Syndicalist takeover only barely averted thanks to the swift actions of the military and Rada opposition, it is clear that such a system has failed our people. A more balanced system is required, one where the legislature does not hold complete control over the executive."
 WHR_Power_To_The_President: "Empower the Executive"
 WHR_Power_To_The_President_desc: "As part of our reforms to ensure a Syndicalist takeover can never happen, we must strengthen the Rada and the Executive. This will formally transform [ROOT.GetNameDef] into a centralist and strong system instead of a parliamentary one."
 WHR_Military_Representation: "Military Representatives"
 WHR_Military_Representation_desc: "The military has proven to be our nation's saviour, so it is only natural that they would be guaranteed representation in our government and the Rada. This way, there will be a more direct connection between civilian and military and will allow the latter to intervene against any Syndicalist plots in a more timely (and legal) manner in the future."
 WHR_Reichspakt_Cooperation: "Deepen Cooperation with the Reichspakt"
 WHR_Reichspakt_Cooperation_desc: "The Reichspakt is the world's last barrier against the Third Internationale and their plot for global revolution. It is imperative that we deepen our ties with Germany to help them defeat Europe's greatest threat."
 WHR_Increase_Role_In_Mitteleuropa: "Increasing our Role in Mitteleuropa"
 WHR_Increase_Role_In_Mitteleuropa_desc: "Germany cannot defend Europe from Syndicalism and Russian imperialism alone, and we have been a minor part of the Reichspakt for far too long. It is time that we increase our contributions to Mitteleuropa's common defence, especially with the rising Russian threat."
 WHR_Belarus_Pure_And_True: "Belarus Pure and True"
 WHR_Belarus_Pure_And_True_desc: "It is not enough that Belarusians have an independent nation. The nation must also protect its values and morals against godlessness and radicalism. [ROOT.GetNameDef] is now back on a path where it will become an example for the rest of Europe despite our size and power."

 WHR_The_Countercoup: "The Countercoup"
 WHR_The_Countercoup_desc: "While the military has stepped in to save our nation from ruin, the democrats in the Rada have proven to be indecisive against the Syndicalist threat. Vaclau Lastouski, leader of the Kryvian movement, has stepped in to lead the nation in its time of need. Once the crypto-syndicalist and liberal traitors are out of the way, we will begin [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s national rejuvenation. "
 WHR_Proclaim_Kryvia: "Proclaim the Kryvian State"
 WHR_Proclaim_Kryvia_desc: "Terms such as White Ruthenia and Belarus are all foreign terms forced on our people. Only Kryvia truly represents our people in its once-pure form, before it was crushed under foreign occupations. With the proclamation of the Kryvian State, we are formally announcing the rebirth of our nation as a free, independent, and pure one."
 WHR_Purge_The_Rada: "Purge the Rada"
 WHR_Purge_The_Rada_desc: "The Rada is filled with leftist degenerates, foreign nationals, and corrupt capitalists. They must be purged and replaced by true servants of the people and nation, all the while making sure that corruption and degeneration can never again seep into the halls of power."
 WHR_Control_The_State: "Controlling the State"
 WHR_Control_The_State_desc: "There are too many barriers set against our movement. If we are to see the rebirth of our nation, we must take these down and take full control of the state and its institutions to reshape it. With power concentrated in the hands of Vaclau Lastouski, we will be able to see the consolidation of the Kryvian state become reality."
 WHR_The_Kryvian_Concept: "The Kryvian Concept"
 WHR_The_Kryvian_Concept_desc: "The Kryvian Concept was developed by Vaclau Lastouski before the Weltkrieg, believing that as descendants of the Kryvich people before the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, are an Aryan people and the purest of the East Slavic nations. It is time for Belarusians to embrace and protect this identity from the Mongol Muscovites to the East and internationalists within."
 WHR_Expropriate_The_Landlords: "Expropriate the Landlords"
 WHR_Expropriate_The_Landlords_desc: "For centuries, Belarusians have been a purely peasant nation under Polish and Russian landlords. The socialists, despite their rhetoric, have failed in their promise to help the peasants, trying too hard to please the enemy. Enough is enough; we will seize the lands and give it to the people, no questions asked, no compensation! Kryvians are no longer slaves!"
 WHR_The_Agrarian_Ideal: "The Agrarian Ideal"
 WHR_The_Agrarian_Ideal_desc: "The Belarusian is, broadly speaking, a poor farmer, and has been for centuries. Even as Kryvians, we are still a people of the land, and agrarian ideals resonate within our souls. We must protect this identity not only in rhetoric, but in action, by uplifting the peasant and the farmer to the level they were always meant to be."
 WHR_Nationalist_Education: "Nationalist Education"
 WHR_Nationalist_Education_desc: "Our socialist predecessors were of the right mind in ensuring a secular and nationalist education for our people. However, they certainly haven't gone far enough with the nationalist aspect, giving far too many concessions to Jews, Poles, and Russians, while letting leftist agitation seep in. The school curriculum must instil a proud Kryvian identity and a strong character."
 WHR_Anti_Russian_Propaganda: "Promote Germanophobia"
 WHR_Anti_Russian_Propaganda_desc: "While Syndicalism is a threat, there is no bigger threat than the Hohenzollerns, our old oppressors. They will return, and they will try to destroy us once again, but we cannot allow it to happen. We can never return under their boots, and we will either prevail or die in our struggle for existence."
 WHR_Nation_Above_Class: "Nation above Class"
 WHR_Nation_Above_Class_desc: "Despite their Marxist ideology, the BSDP has not only completely failed to create a classless society, but further worsened class divisions. Belarusians or Kryvians will no longer be divided by class, for we are one indivisible nation."
 WHR_Nationalism_Under_Reichspakt: "Nationalism under the Reichspakt"
 WHR_Nationalism_Under_Reichspakt_desc: "There is no shame in admitting that we will need help to keep invaders out, especially with the Muscovites at our border. Germany is our only true ally here, and our nation will likely only survive as part of the Reichspakt. As we work to become a self-reliant nation, Germany will help us towards this goal, and we will remain steadfast allies in the coming storm."
 WHR_Kryvian_Orthodox_Church: "Nationalise the Churches"
 WHR_Kryvian_Orthodox_Church_desc: "Despite Lastouski's best attempts to convince the people that religion plays no part in national identity, far too many people refuse to let go. As the Catholic Church remains influenced by the Poles and the Orthodox Church by the Muscovites, we must rupture their ties with the foreign enemies. The Churches in Kryvia must be completely subservient to the state."
 WHR_Constitutional_Amendment: "Constitutional Amendments"
 WHR_Constitutional_Amendment_desc: "The Constitution, full of leftist ideas and values, simply cannot be used by our nation. However, it is not completely unsalvageable. With effort and significant amendments, we can fix it to serve the needs of the Kryvian people and its institutions."
 WHR_The_Rise_of_Kryvia: "The Rise of Kryvia"
 WHR_The_Rise_of_Kryvia_desc: "With power consolidated within the Kryvian movement, we can truly begin the rebirth of the Belarusian people into the Kryvian nation. We will never be slaves to another invader ever again, and we will not waste the opportunity the Germans have given to our people as we begin to take our place among Europe's nations."

 WHR_Entice_German_Investors: "Entice German Investors"
 WHR_Entice_German_Investors_desc: "There is currently plenty of resentment towards German companies as they pulled out of our country after Black Monday. However, we cannot let these feelings get in the way of the fact that we need the investors to return and, this time, stay. This will require some fairly generous offers to entice them back into the White Ruthenian market."
 WHR_Consolidate_State_Assets: "Consolidate State Assets"
 WHR_Consolidate_State_Assets_desc: "Because of the limited amount of capital within the country, the government has been highly active in the economy to help spur development. This means that not only does the state own a significant portion of it, but also bloat and inefficiencies. Consolidated state enterprises and downsizing will help lower state expenses and, in the long-run, improve their efficiency."
 WHR_Loosen_Labour_Laws: "Loosen Labour Laws"
 WHR_Loosen_Labour_Laws_desc: "The BSDP government, true to their socialist rhetoric, implemented strong and comprehensive labour laws that favoured workers over owners. This makes foreign companies less eager to invest even with the relatively lower costs. Loosening these laws, despite the protests of the All-Belarusian Congress of Trade Unions, will help make investing in our country more attractive."
 WHR_Request_Bail_Out: "Request a Bailout"
 WHR_Request_Bail_Out_desc: "Even with our best effort and decisions, our economy is simply too weak on its own to cope with the global economic downturn. We will need to make a formal request to the German government to help bail out our economy, likely involving some long-term loans from German banks. We can only hope the Germans will have generous terms for their steadfast ally in the East."

### Bulak-Balakhovich Focuses ###
 
 WHR_Cooperate_With_ZD: "Cooperate with Zialiony Dub"
 WHR_Cooperate_With_ZD_desc: "Vacłaŭ Łastoŭski's 'Green Oak' organization is a highly interesting group. Upholding unorthodox believes on the origins of our people, they are nonetheless highly nationalistic and somewhat pro-Russian. With a few benefits thrown their way we could forge an alliance and entrench our position in ruling Belarus, or 'Kryvia' if they personally still want to refer to it as such."
 WHR_Nationalism_Under_Moscow: "Nationalism under Moscow"
 WHR_Nationalism_Under_Moscow_desc: "To anyone saying that nationalism must mean utter cessation of brotherly ties we say ah! Our great big brother, the Russian nation, has only our best interest in mind. With their official support the Belarusian national pride shall flourish and sweep away any internal threat posed by so-called 'patriots'. Nothing more than a bunch of crypto-syndicalists!"
 WHR_Foothold_For_Russian_Army: "Foothold for the Russian Army"
 WHR_Foothold_For_Russian_Army_desc: "To ensure that our people are secure and protected from foreign aggression, Belarus must be transformed into an unshakable fortress for the brother army of Russia. Not only will that keep us safe, we can observe and learn from Russia's technical war experience and apply their inventions in reforming our armed forces."
 WHR_Initiate_Agrarian_Reforms: "Initiate Agrarian Reforms"
 WHR_Initiate_Agrarian_Reforms_desc: "A nation cannot thrive nor survive without a steady supply of food. Such a nation will simply die if urgent measures to transform the chaotic land situation are not put in place. We cannot allow Belarus to be that nation. Thus, we set out to solve the Agrarian trouble once and for all, ensuring boundless prosperity for our countrymen."
 WHR_Bolster_Belarusian_Patriotism: "Bolster Belarusian Patriotism"
 WHR_Bolster_Belarusian_Patriotism_desc: "While we have done much to bolster the national fervor inside great Belarus, it is still not enough. Our people must be proud and ever thankful for being born Belarusian, for forming the unified entity known as Belarus. We are patriots and we are proud."
 WHR_Negotiate_For_Greater_Belarus: "Negotiate for Greater Belarus"
 WHR_Negotiate_For_Greater_Belarus_desc: "With the cooperation between the brotherly nations of Belarus and Russia unshattered by any threats, the time is right to ask for the return of our favors. A simple and humble request, seeing how much we sacrificed by now. The transfer of rightfully Belarusian lands to our nation, so we can serve as Russia's greatest ally forever."
 WHR_Nationalize_Industry: "Nationalize Key Industries"
 WHR_Nationalize_Industry_desc: "There are certain industries that are vital to the continued existence of our nation. It is simply ridiculous they are allowed to be held by foreign overlords or disloyal businessmen. Immediately, all of such industries will be brought under the aegida of the state."
 WHR_disband_rada: "Dissolve the Rada"
 WHR_disband_rada_desc: "Despite being a powerless body, the Rada still exists as a measure of the people’s will, and thus is a constant threat to our rule We must enact emergency measures and fully disband the Rada before anyone has a chance to sabotage our regime."
 WHR_orthodox_support: "Court The Church"
 WHR_orthodox_support_desc: "The Orthodox Church plays a major role in Belarusian society and by gaining the official outspoken support of the Church we can promote our new order to the average population and minimise any resistance."
 WHR_purge_socialists: "Purge the Socialists"
 WHR_purge_socialists_desc: "Despite years of being on the fringes politically, the syndicalists still maintain quite a bit of support among some in the nation. What’s worse, the social democrats are still perhaps the most popular party within the nation! We must vigorously root out and destroy any lefist sentiments among the populace if our regime is to be unopposed."
 WHR_labour_battalions: "Create Labour-Battalions"
 WHR_labour_battalions_desc: "Our regime still remains unpopular among many who lack employment. By creating labour battalions and public works programs we can keep the people employed and help to build up [ROOT.GetNameDef] into a strong and modern nation."
 WHR_nachalnik_dzyerzhavy: "Načalnik Dzyaržavy"
 WHR_nachalnik_dzyerzhavy_desc: "Stanisłaŭ Bułak-Bałachowič is by far one of the greatest leaders in our history. A warrior, a leader, a father to our people, there is not a thing he cannot accomplish. Having proven his merit in leading Belarus and turning it into a power to be reckoned with,Bułak-Bałachowič shall assume the title of Načalnik Dzyaržavy, the Chief of State. Honoring the legacy of the great Tadevuš Kasciuška."

### Army ###
 WHR_Expand_Army: "Creation of the People's Army"
 WHR_Expand_Army_desc: "With renewed worries about the Russian threat, there is finally interest in military reform and expansion now that the nation's very survival is at stake. To this end, the Rada has approved the creation of a new People’s Army, taking its name from the late People’s Republic."
 WHR_Revive_BVZR: "Revive the Military Central Council"
 WHR_Revive_BVZR_desc: "The Belarusian Military Central Council, or Belvaiskrada, was formed in November 1917 to organise the first Belarusian military units, but was disbanded the next year as the German Army occupied Minsk. The purpose of the revived Belvaiskrada is to transform the army into a proper, modern military force that can stand up on its own as much as possible, focusing on the quality of officers, NCOs, and training."
 
 WHR_Create_BKA: "Creation of the Belarusian Home Guard"
 WHR_Create_BKA_desc: "Two things are clear: The People's Army will never be able to beat back a Russian or German invasion on its own, and the National Guard is too limited in scope to provide for local defence and auxiliary support. As such, the National Guard will be replaced by the Belarusian Home Guard, or BKA, which will focus on mobilising the civilian population and the army reserves for a prolonged guerrilla war against the occupier."
 WHR_Expand_Military_Schools: "Expand the Central Military School"
 WHR_Expand_Military_Schools_desc: "The Central Military School is the only institution capable of training officers for the People's Army, and they still often have to study in Germany for further instruction. The School is in dire need of expansion if we are to increase the quality of our officers, which will include new facilities and hiring foreign instructors."
 WHR_Improving_NCO: "Improving our NCOs"
 WHR_Improving_NCO_desc: "Professional officers are important, but non-commissioned officers have also seen significant professionalisation since the Weltkrieg. Their importance in maintaining the link between officers and soldiers is immense, and their role on the frontlines is impossible to overstate. Increasing their training will help increase the quality of the army as a whole, for officers rely on them and soldiers look up to them."
 WHR_Belarusian_Army_Manuals: "Belarusian Army Manuals"
 WHR_Belarusian_Army_Manuals_desc: "As embarrassing as it is to say, most of our newer manuals are in German, which few Belarusians can read, and the outdated ones in Russian. There are, of course, unofficial translations from educated officers and volunteers, but there are still no formal manuals in Belarusian. With the increasing literacy of the people, it is more than about time to compile modern army manuals in our own language."
 WHR_Formalize_Sappers: "Formalise Sappers and Assault Units"
 WHR_Formalize_Sappers_desc: "Technical troops in the People's Army remain more-or-less ad-hoc, informal organisations, with engineers often sent to train in Germany. With the growing number of educated technicians in the army, it is time to organise them into formal units. Furthermore, our assault units, also trained on the German model, will also gain formal designations."
 WHR_Motorization_Logistics: "Motorisation and Logistics"
 WHR_Motorization_Logistics_desc: "If there is one military benefit of being an agrarian nation with increasing agricultural mechanisation, it's that many of our soldiers are familiar with motor vehicles. With the increasing number of trucks and even armoured vehicles on the battlefield, we can use it to improve our logistical situation despite the less-than-ideal infrastructure of the country."
 WHR_Purchase_Heavy_Equipment: "Heavy Equipment Purchase"
 WHR_Purchase_Heavy_Equipment_desc: "It is safe to say that Belarus will not produce heavy military equipment in large numbers in the near future, making us dependent on importing them from our allies. With an increasing need for trucks, radios, and artillery on the modern battlefield, we will have to start securing a stockpile of heavy materiel before it is too late."
 WHR_Dnieper_Dvina_Line: "Dnieper-Dvina Line"
 WHR_Dnieper_Dvina_Line_desc: "While the border on the rivers Dnieper and Dvina cuts us off from well over a million Belarusians under Russian oppression, it gives us and our allies a far better defensive position when the Russians inevitably return. Despite being part of Germany's Ostwall project, the Belarusian section was seriously neglected, presenting a weakpoint in the Reichspakt. We must prepare our defences before it is too late."
 WHR_Auxillary_Battalions: "Auxiliary Battalions"
 WHR_Auxillary_Battalions_desc: "In order to mobilise as much of the population as possible, auxiliary battalions are to be formed from reservists, veterans, and civilian volunteers to support military operations. This will increase the number of available manpower for the armed forces and decrease the amount of training necessary for new formations."
 WHR_Militarize_Police: "Militarise Police Units"
 WHR_Militarize_Police_desc: "Local police units provide us with an interesting opportunity for military operations. As they are already trained to provide security and are very familiar with the local situation they serve in, they will prove invaluable in organising local resistance to the occupier and help funnel arms to partisans."
 WHR_Local_Munitions: "Local Munitions Production"
 WHR_Local_Munitions_desc: "When it came to establishing military industries, Belarus was thoroughly ignored during the Tsarist era. As such, the country lacks even the basic facilities to produce ammunition. In order to reduce our dependence on foreign imports and as an important entry-point in developing a military industrial sector, we will begin constructing facilities able to produce rifle and pistol ammunition."
 WHR_Partisan_Warfare: "Partisan Warfare"
 WHR_Partisan_Warfare_desc: "Sadly, it is very likely that in the case of an invasion, parts of our country will be overrun by the enemy. However, the Belarusian people are already experienced with partisan warfare since the Russian Civil War. It is only natural that we embrace this experience as part of our military doctrine and use every means possible to defend our homeland."
 WHR_Equipment_Standardization: "Equipment Standardisation"
 WHR_Equipment_Standardization_desc: "The People's Army's stockpile of weapons is an eclectic mess of Imperial Russian and German rifles, pistols, and even artillery pieces, all using different calibres. This creates a logistical nightmare for the Army, having to supply many types of ammo to our forces. This issue will only be solved once we streamline and standardise our equipment."
 WHR_Minsk_Arms_Plant: "[206.GetName] Arms Plant"
 WHR_Minsk_Arms_Plant_desc: "With our steadily growing industry, we are finally able to build the [206.GetName] Arms Plant, which will produce small arms locally for the People's Army. While this endeavour is only possible with extensive help from our allies, it will help increase our nation's economic independence."
 WHR_Aviation_Instructors: "Invite Aviation Instructors"
 WHR_Aviation_Instructors_desc: "Building an air force is a very big task and it will simply not be possible without help from foreigners. Thankfully, our stronger allies have far more experience in air warfare and can help us with instructors to train pilots and mechanics for the future Military Air Fleet."
 WHR_Military_Air_Fleet: "Form the Military Air Fleet"
 WHR_Military_Air_Fleet_desc: "While there is still a long way to go before the People's Army can protect the skies of Belarus on its own, the creation of a formal air force is an important step our people can be truly proud of. Air warfare has become an increasingly important part of modern war, and despite our late start, the Belarusian people will finally be able to fight off our enemies high above our homes."
 WHR_Baranavichy_Repair_Plant: "Baranavichy Aircraft Repair Plant"
 WHR_Baranavichy_Repair_Plant_desc: "The city of Baranavichy has been steadily industrialising and an air base was created in its outskirts along with the facilities required to repair aircraft. By expanding the air base and the repair facilities, we can jumpstart the Belarusian aeronautics industry and begin training mechanics and engineers on our own."
 WHR_Technical_Assistance: "Technical Assistance"
 WHR_Technical_Assistance_desc: "While our industrialisation steadily progresses, we continue to struggle with a lack of technical know-how in many sectors. With some help from experts from allied countries, we can overcome these hurdles and improve the pool of Belarusian skilled workers."
 WHR_Krupp_Contacts: "Krupp Contacts"
 WHR_Krupp_Contacts_desc: "There are certainly benefits to being part of the German sphere, and one of them are contacts within its largest firms. It is no secret that the People's Army lacks artillery, the queen of the battlefield. The Krupp conglomerate is well-known for its high-quality guns, and with the right words with them and the German Army, we can secure some older artillery pieces they no longer use for cheap."
 WHR_Tractors_to_Tanks: "From Tractors to Tanks"
 WHR_Tractors_to_Tanks_desc: "Agricultural mechanisation has created Belarus' most prominent industry: Agricultural tractors. With the growth of our automotive and agricultural machinery industry, it is possible to convert civilian production into military vehicles, including tanks."
 WHR_Expand_Cavalry: "Expanding the Cavalry"
 WHR_Expand_Cavalry_desc: "Despite the dwindling use of cavalry in modern warfare, in a country such as Belarus, horse cavalry still has use as support and mobile troops because of our rough terrain and lacklustre infrastructure. Until we can improve our industry and infrastructure, we cannot discard the use of light cavalry as a way to maximise the mobility of our forces and strike the enemy quickly."
 WHR_Womens_Support_Service: "Women's Support Service"
 WHR_Womens_Support_Service_desc: "With the nation's survival at stake, Belarusian women will also step in to help by filling auxiliary roles in the military and jobs at the homefront. The Women's Support Service will organise the nation's women for the war effort."
 WHR_Material_Assistance: "Materiel Assistance"
 WHR_Material_Assistance_desc: "With our nation's lack of industry has made it very difficult to arm and equip our armed forces. It is time for our allies to prove themselves worthy of that title and help us. After all, if Belarus falls, they will be next."
 WHR_Automobile_Repair_Plant: "Automobile Repair Plant"
 WHR_Automobile_Repair_Plant_desc: "The [206.GetName] Automobile Repair Plant has proved to be an integral part of Belarus' industrialisation, helping maintain and repair the increasing amount of motor vehicles in the agricultural and industrial sectors. It can and will be mobilised for the war effort, repairing and upgrading the vehicles of our and our allies' military."
 WHR_Black_Cats: "Black Cats"
 WHR_Black_Cats_desc: "To further improve our ability to wage a guerrilla war against the occupiers, \"Black Cats\" units have been formed under the command of Michał Vituška with the purpose of engage in harassment of enemy forces, sabotage, and capture of supplies."
 WHR_Repurpose_Captured_Equipment: "Repurpose Captured Equipment"
 WHR_Repurpose_Captured_Equipment_desc: "With the increasing amount of captured equipment from the enemy, not all of it is proving useful for our forces. Letting our armourers and quartermasters convert the calibres of enemy weapons or repairing damaged equipment, we can further improve our ability to supply our forces."
 WHR_Cavalry_Motorization: "Cavalry Motorisation"
 WHR_Cavalry_Motorization_desc: "As our industry and infrastructure improve, we can finally begin considering the motorisation of our forces. As part of our doctrine of keeping our troops light, mobile, and concealed from the enemy, our cavalry force would benefit the most from motor vehicles and armour. The creation of an armoured cavalry will greatly improve the firepower of our mobile forces."

WHR_Black_Banner_Engulfs_Nation: "The Black Banner Engulfs the Nation"
WHR_Black_Banner_Engulfs_Nation_desc: "The downfall of statist institutions and the entire apparatus of proletarian oppression has finally become reality, heralded by the anarchist organization 'Chernoe Znamia'. Starting out their work throughout the Polish-Lithuanian-Belarusian borderlands, these Anarchists led by revolutionaries Juda Grossman and Mark Mratchny have assumed control of the Belarusian government to bring about the end of societal and proletarian exploitation at the hands of the state while erasing its legacy as we progress towards an Anarchist utopia."
WHR_Question_Kropotkin: "The Question of Kropotkin"
WHR_Question_Kropotkin_desc: "The initial main source of inspiration for the 'Chernoe Znamia' was the Anarchist thought of Kropotkin, along with others like Bakunin and Makhno. However, many within our ranks, including the influential Juda Grossman, see the so-called "Anarchist Prince" Kropotkin as a man of half measures - a saloon anarchist and bourgeois playing pretend revolutionary unwilling to reject national chauvinism and statist patriotism. This question over Kropotkin’s legacy has divided our organization, and as such, we must finally decide as a group whether to shun Kropotkin’s legacy or honor it, deciding the foundation of our Anarchist Revolution along with it."
WHR_Paint_Red_Cross_Black: "Paint the Red Cross Black"
WHR_Paint_Red_Cross_Black_desc: "In order to care for the needs of our people, particularly in concern to their health and wellbeing, we must establish a healthcare system that can work within our stateless framework. As such, we shall establish a new organization from the bottom-up, based around the principles and practices of the international Red Cross and its sister organizations, to ensure that our Anarchist communities will have humanitarian help and healthcare delivered to them when they need it."
WHR_Cooperate_Ukrainian_Georgian_Brothers: "Cooperate with Ukrainian and Georgian Brothers"
WHR_Cooperate_Ukrainian_Georgian_Brothers_desc: "Georgians and Ukrainians are our brothers and sisters in culture and Anarchy. Together, we share a common goal only separated by the easily-surmountable barriers of geography and language. We shall work to establish close ties to our sister organizations and like-minded groups in these disparate territories in order to foment our own revolutionary ambitions."
WHR_Dethroning_False_Idols: "Dethroning the False Idols"
WHR_Dethroning_False_Idols_desc: "Organized religion is nought but the Opium of the Masses; a phantasmagoria spun by the ruling elite so the weak shall stay meek and submissive so as to remain more easily oppressed and exploited. It is high time we cut out this theocratic cancer as we burn their organizations to the ground. Atop their ashes, we shall found a society of true human spirit far greater and more just and free than any so-called city upon a hill."
WHR_Groups_Revolutionary_Actives: "Groups of Revolutionary Actives"
WHR_Groups_Revolutionary_Actives_desc: "A truly revolutionary uprising requires strong will and skill, which admittedly and regrettably the ordinary person lacks. The future vanguards of the revolution must be red as rubies and hard like diamonds, and equipped with a conscience that is still not dissuaded by the violent and dangerous nature of heroic revolutionary deed. Our utmost goal is to find such gems and radicalize them, utilizing these hardened radicals and extremist zealots to bring about our shared Anarchist dream."
WHR_Terror_Without_Motive: "Terror Without Motive"
WHR_Terror_Without_Motive_desc: "Terror should not target only the proven unjust, for it should reach throughout the entire social hierarchy of classist exploiters and naturally-oppresive elitists, for they are all guilty in one way or another without even needing to have the motive or conscious guilt. Every single one of them is guilty, either by deed or association, and as such they all must be punished. We shall have our revenge and retribution, redistributing and repurposing what is left behind for the good of the true proletariat."
WHR_Peace_Villages_War_Palaces: "Peace to Villages, War against Palaces"
WHR_Peace_Villages_War_Palaces_desc: "With the verminous elites dethroned and dealt their harsh justice, the property of these landowners, aristocrats, and other socioeconomic and classist parasites is to be distributed among communities in need across our territory. Palaces, the monuments of vanity, will either be toppled and replaced with useful amenities or repurposed to fit the needs of their community, the vain gardens and other frivolous constructions of the rich will be plowed away, and the rest of their trinkets and monoliths shall be destroyed or converted in one way or another. We shall bring peace to the village and wage war against these palaces of opulence and greed in order to free and care for the proletariat."
WHR_Property_Enemy_Freedom: "Property is the Enemy of Freedom"
WHR_Property_Enemy_Freedom_desc: "Any sort of property is used only for exploitation. Its abolishment and the further implementation of communal ownership will resolve the problem of homelessness, famine, and unemployment while providing a fair and healthy lifestyle for all citizens within the territory of our stateless Anarchist paradise. The only property which shall remain shall only remain as a temporary measure as we progress the Revolution and our society towards true Anarchism, and shall eventually be phased out as well when agreeable to the needs and whims of the communal proletariat."
WHR_Reject_Delusion_Intellectualism: "Reject the Delusion of Intellectualism"
WHR_Reject_Delusion_Intellectualism_desc: "Lawyers, philosophers, academics, clerks and bureaucrats are all impractical, loafing around as privileged professionals and useless, spoiled eggheads. The social and societal constructs which relied on proletarian exploitation carried these ‘skilled professionals’ above the oppressed masses. It is finally time to end that disgusting example of classist injustice and knock this mass of haughty, over-funded bloat down to their rightful place."
WHR_Immolate_Monetary_System: "Immolate the Monetary System"
WHR_Immolate_Monetary_System_desc: "In all communities across the state, the division of goods and services shall be determined from each according to their ability and bounds, to each according to their needs, along the grounds of autonomously created rules and Anarchist principles. Communes will be allowed to exchange goods and services between each other and the value of these goods and services shall be decided by the amount of work needed to manufacture them, in accordance with common Socialist principle. With these ideas as our framework, we shall replace the caustic, oppressive, opportunistic, and predatory Capitalist system with a fair, free, and equal Anarcho-Communist economy."
WHR_Fair_Division_Labour: "A Fair Division of Labour"
WHR_Fair_Division_Labour_desc: "With the road to Anarchism beginning to be paved and with the monetary system of Capitalist exploitationism finally ablaze, our next step towards true Socialist paradise is the liberation of society and the establishment of local communes to govern common property. This move shall allow a fair division of labour and duties among our populace, thanks to which none shall be hungry or destitute, and all shall have their position, job, and overall purpose in our free and communal society."
WHR_Anarchy_Above_All_Borders: "Anarchy Above All Borders"
WHR_Anarchy_Above_All_Borders_desc: "The people of Belarus, although deeply committed to our cause, are unable to forget about their lost kin - the inhabitants of Vilnius, Belostok, or Odessa. We must alleviate the plight and pain of our people and deliver these brethren the torch of the revolution, liberating these oppressed countrymen and kin under the black banner of Anarchism."
WHR_New_Man_Born_Seas_Fire: "A New Man Born in the Seas of Fire"
WHR_New_Man_Born_Seas_Fire_desc: "Under the brilliant direction of the "Chernoe Znamia" and the guiding black light of Anarchism, we have cast down the oppressive Capitalist order, replacing it with an Anarchist utopia-in-progress. A new generation of free proletariat shall grow in a reality supported by the love of freedom and the will of the revolutionary deed. Foreign to us will be the concepts of exploitation by force or money, for the statist beast has been slain, and atop its corpse, a new garden of opportunity and Anarchist freedom has bloomed, guarded by the new Belarusian man, born in the seas of fire that engulfed the old order and forged like iron, ready to defend our paradise to the last breath."

However, this policy was quickly tempered as the Rada sought support from the German Empire and the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party was forced to install a monarchy. As such, more moderate land redistribution, which included compensation to landlords, has been in place since 1921. However, the slow pace and numerous problems encountered led to criticism within the BSDP and from its leftist coalition partners, calling for a radical policy to replace it as the Belarusian Socialist Hramada had promised back in 1917."

 WHR_agrarian_society_2: "Modernising Agrarian Society"
 WHR_agrarian_society_2_desc: "With the growth of industry in the country, the issues of rural overpopulation and unproductive agriculture are being mitigated by growing urbanisation and the redistribution of land to a growing class of smallholders. Along with the improvement of rural infrastructure and institutions, the Belarusian people are on the way to becoming a modern agrarian society and not a backwards one."

 WHR_weak_national_identity: "Weak National Identity"
 WHR_weak_national_identity_desc: "While many nations in Eastern Europe have experienced a national awakening in the second half of the 19th century, the idea of a Belarusian nation only started to appear in the early 20th century. By the time Russia fell to the Bolsheviks, very few Belarusians could even comprehend the idea of nationalism, let alone embrace it, and many even considered Belarusians to be nothing but Polonised Russians or poor, uncultured peasants unworthy of the title of "nation". Since 1917, Belarusian intellectuals have been fighting an uphill battle to bring education and, through it, national identity to the poor, illiterate peasants of the region. Even now, the majority of the population is apathetic at best or hostile at worst to the idea of Belarusian nationhood."

This helped raise the literacy level significantly, but it still falls short compared to our neighbours and remains unacceptably low compared to the rest of Europe. The government's project includes building many more schools in the countryside, expanding the existing ones, and re-introducing night classes for urban workers.

 WHR_Quatrillingualism: "Personal Principle"
 WHR_Quatrillingualism_desc: "The Personal Principle was developed by the Austrian Social-Democratic Workers' Party as a way to tackle the question of nationalism in their multiethnic state. This involves detaching the nation (as in, the people) from the land they reside in. This is particularly useful to avoid bifurcating states that do not have clear ethnic lines. Instead, cultural and educational institutions are handled by a council representing a particular ethnicity, ensuring that they have autonomy in their national affairs."

 WHR_Industrialize_Mozyr_desc: "Built in 1912 by brothers Uladzimir and Barys Ryk, the Hardware Plant manufactures many tons of nails and wires for construction and other assorted projects. Being one of the first metal processing industries in [ROOT.GetNameDef], it has become a symbol of industry in the region and should be modernised and expanded. The plant could potentially reach daily production of 27 tons of nails needed for many basic construction projects."
 WHR_Industrialize_Pinsk_desc: "As the Pinsk region is one of the more developed parts of the country, with many food processing and woodworking industries, electrifying the region has become an important task to maximise the area's output. The power plant in Bielaaziorsk is perhaps one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in Belarus, hoping to reach outputs in the hundreds of thousands of kilowatt to power the western parts of the country and the neighbouring areas of our allies."
 WHR_Industrialize_Novogrudok: "Build the Haradzieja Sugar Plant"
 WHR_Industrialize_Novogrudok_desc: "The western part of the country is home to many food-processing industries and is home to its sugar beet-growing lands. Building facilities able to process these beets into refined sugar will create a new industry that will support Belarusian farmers and stimulate the economy."
 WHR_Industrialize_Minsk: "Build the Žodzina Power Plant"
 WHR_Industrialize_Minsk_desc: "[206.GetName] is the most industrially-developed region of the country. To increase productivity, our industry must have access to more power. With peat being one of the most plentiful resources around, a thermal power plant using it would be ideal, with the town of Žodzina being the best location."
 WHR_Empower_the_Bund_Unions: "Support Bund-aligned Businesses"
 WHR_Make_Farmers_into_Workers: "Encourage Urbanisation"
 WHR_Industrialize_Mozyr_2: "[194.GetName] Oil Refinery"
 WHR_Industrialize_Mozyr_2_desc: "Southern Belarus is home to oil sands, but the technology and capital required to extract and process it are not available to us. However, we can pre-emptively invest in the refining industry, allowing us to produce some fuel from crude oil imports, which may prove instrumental in any conflict at the border."
 WHR_Industrialize_Pinsk: "Bielaaziorsk Power Plant Project"
 WHR_iron_prospecting: "Prospect in Akolaŭsk and Navasiolkaŭsk"
 WHR_iron_prospecting_desc: "The iron ore deposits of Akolaŭsk and Navasiolkaŭsk in the [204.GetName] region is one of the few in the country but remains untouched. Starting mining operations would create industrial jobs in the region while supplying the [1087.GetName] Metallurgical Plant with local ores to increase steel production."

 WHR_Civil_War: "Crushing the Hramada"
 WHR_Civil_War_desc: "The Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union, simply known as the Hramada, has been, until recently, the dominant power in the White Ruthenian Rada, and was the first ruling party of the restored Republic. The Hramada has always been full of Syndicalist sympathisers and agents, and their subversive actions have not gone unnoticed by the military. With their government toppled, they have taken up arms in the countryside. The People's Army will crush them soon enough and restore order."
 WHR_german_intervention: "German Intervention Imminent"
 WHR_german_intervention_desc: "Germany is losing faith in our ability to hold the country together. Unless we can restore our legitimacy as the true government of [ROOT.GetNameDef], they will intervene to take matters in their own hands."
 WHR_Mogilev_Assault: "Take [1087.GetName]"
 WHR_Braslaw_Assault: "Take [207.GetName]"
 WHR_Pinsk_Assault: "Take [95.GetName]"
 WHR_Bobruisk_Assault: "Take [204.GetName]"
 WHR_Mozyr_Assault: "Take [194.GetName]"
 WHR_Final_Blow: "Round Up Remaining Agitators"

 WHR_arms_import: "Arms Import"
 WHR_arms_import_desc: "The industry of Belarus is somewhere between lacking and non-existent, meaning that we struggle to produce equipment the People's Army requires to fulfil its role. Thankfully, our ally has a lot of old equipment it is willing to sell to us for relatively cheap, allowing us to acquire extra hardware while our meager military industry can remain focused on what it can actually produce."
 WHR_import_small_arms: "Import Rifles"
 WHR_import_small_arms_desc: "Our ability to produce even the infantryman's standard rifle is limited. Surely, Germany has enough old Mausers from the Weltkrieg to spare..."
 WHR_import_artillery: "Import Artillery"
 WHR_import_artillery_desc: "Krupp is well known for its fine artillery pieces. Germany is also known to have produced a lot of field guns in the previous war. Perhaps they have some old pieces to spare for their easternmost vanguard."
 WHR_import_planes: "Import Fighters"
 WHR_import_planes_desc: "We may have the facilities to repair and refuel planes, but building them from scratch is a whole other matter. If we are to defend our airspace, we will need some fighters. Hopefully, the Germans have some old biplanes to spare to give us SOMETHING to fight with!"
 WHR_import_support_equipment: "Import Support Equipment"
 WHR_import_support_equipment_desc: "From radios to surgical equipment, military technology has developed leaps and bounds in the last decades. We are lacking a lot of specific pieces of equipment to help support our troops behind and at the frontlines that aren't weapons or vehicles."
 WHR_import_motorised: "Import Trucks"
 WHR_import_motorised_desc: "Motor vehicles have secured an important place on the modern battlefield from troop transports to ambulances. While we do have a fledging tractor industry, well, that may help the farmer in his field, but not likely our brave soldiers on the battlefield. Unless..."

 WHR_integrate_state_easy_desc: "The majority of the population of [FROM.GetName] recognise themselves as Belarusians, or are clearly Belarusians and will quickly realise that fact. It will be relatively easy to integrate the region into [ROOT.GetNameDef]."
 WHR_integrate_state_medium_desc: "A plurality of the population of [FROM.GetName] recognise themselves as Belarusians, or a good part of the population has been de-Belarusianised in recent years. It will take some time to integrate the region into [ROOT.GetNameDef]."
 WHR_integrate_state_hard: "Belarusian identity in [FROM.GetName] is either weak or has been thoroughly suppressed in recent years. It will take great effort to integrate the region into [ROOT.GetNameDef]."
 WHR_rebuild_local_administration: "Rebuild Local Administration in [FROM.GetName]"
 WHR_rebuild_local_administration_desc: "With Belarusian identity solidified, our ability to convince the local population of their Belarusianness has been greatly improved. By sending civil servants and teachers to [FROM.GetName] and by working with locals, we will be able to gain their trust and recognition. We cannot repeat the mistakes of 1918, when we were barely able to expand our reach outside [206.GetName] without German support."
 WHR_strengthen_military_administration: "Strengthen Military Presence in [FROM.GetName]"
 WHR_strengthen_military_administration_desc: "The Army has jurisdiction over the newly-acquired regions. By strengthening their presence, we can ensure security and protect the local population and slowly gain their trust. Or force them to comply, if it comes to that."

 WHR_reclaim_vilnya: "Reassert Northern Claims"
 WHR_reclaim_vilnya_desc: "To bring about good relations between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [LIT.GetNameDef], an agreement between the two allies was reached on April 27, 1922, where the Belarusian government recognised Vilnius as the capital of Lithuania in exchange for official guarantees for rights and autonomy for Belarusians in the country. However, with the agreement essentially null and void, we can reassert our claims on important Belarusian cities as Vilnya and Hrodna so that we may liberate them in the future."
 WHR_reclaim_bialystok: "Reassert Western Claims"
 WHR_reclaim_homiel: "Reassert Southern Claims"
 WHR_reclaim_homiel_desc: "During the chaos of the Russian Civil War, the Ukrainians were able to secure a significant amount of Southern Belarus out of Bolshevik hands. While they ceded important cities such as [95.GetName] and [194.GetName], cities such as [241.GetName] and Brest remained in the hands of the Hetman. We could only accept this at the time, for our position was too weak to assert our claims across the Dnieper and in Polesia. Now that Ukraine is no longer aligned with us, we can reassert these claims in the hopes of liberating them in the future."
 WHR_reclaim_smolensk: "Reassert Eastern Claims"

 WHR_global_belarus: "Assert Independence in Foreign Relations"
 WHR_global_belarus_desc: "For too long Belarus was deprived of its legitimate place in the world. While some have ignored our existence, the others simply believed we are not capable of any foreign relations at all. Time to prove they were wrong!"
 WHR_ukrainian_claims: "Claim Ukrainian Lands"
 WHR_ukrainian_claims_desc: "Despite our initial claims, our rightful lands of Brest-Litovsk and Gomel were given to Ukraine in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Now with our nationalism growing, it is time to claim those lands as being rightfully ours!"
 WHR_lithuanian_claims: "Claims in Lithuania"
 WHR_lithuanian_claims_desc: "The peoples of Belarus and Lithuania were always close neighbours. In this harsh times we should be even closer to each other."
 WHR_russian_claims: "Claim Russian Lands"
 WHR_russian_claims_desc: "An artificial line was drawn through our country at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk leaving many Belarusians still under Russian rule. With our growth in strength and nationalism we can claim those Belarusian lands under Russian occupation as being rightfully ours."

 WHR_secede_from_RP: "Leave the Reichspakt"
 WHR_secede_from_RP_desc: "While conditions have improved for [ROOT.GetNameDef] since the end of Russian rule, in many ways the White Ruthenian economy is still exploited by the Reichspakt system and the [ROOT.GetLeader] still answers to Berlin. If we are to fully prosper as a nation we must begin to assert ourselves as an independent nation both politically and economically rather than simply taking directions from Berlin."
 WHR_equal_RP_membership: "Request Further Independence"
 WHR_equal_RP_membership_desc: "Our nation has grown since its foundation, and we are no longer as reliant on German assistance than we were back then. Perhaps it is time to ask our protectors for greater independence as a reward for our loyalty to this point."
 WHR_russian_alliance: "Join the Russian Alliance"
 WHR_russian_alliance_desc: "The Russians are closer to us ideologically and ethnically, we should join their new alliance."
 WHR_internationale: "Join The Internationale"
 WHR_internationale_desc: "The Internationale is at the forefront of international socialism and the main military alliance for socialist nations. It would be foolish not to seek friendship with the communards in Paris."
 WHR_intermarium: "Join The Intermarium"
 WHR_intermarium_desc: "Our slavic brothers in Poland and the Ukraine have cast off their shackles and opted to form a military alliance to prevent the spread of Russo-German aggression. Naturally we should seek to join this budding alliance."


 WHR_attack_poland: "Former 'Nation of Lords' - Today 'Proletarian Nation'"
 WHR_attack_poland_desc: "For centuries, Poles were a nation of lords and exploited not only their countrymen but also Belarusians, Jews and Lithuanians. Today (as Jan W. Machajski noted) they themselves are suffering their misery first at the hands of the Russians and today at the hands of the Germans. So the time has come to help them free themselves from their shackles."
 WHR_attack_lit: "Dawn of Anarchy on the Baltic"
 WHR_attack_lit_desc: "The Lithuanians are a nation of peasants oppressed for years by the Poles, Russians and eventually the Germans. Despite attempts at revolutionary uprising centered around the Aušrininkai movement, national and class liberation has not come."
 WHR_attack_ukraine: "Union of Poor Peasants"
 WHR_attack_ukraine_desc: "Over the years, the ZBCh has tried to bring about the overthrow of the institutions of capitalist exploitation in Ukraine. So far, all attempts have failed but today we can help them militarily!"
 WHR_fate_of_conquered_lands: "Fate of Eastern Europe"


 WHR_establish_LIT_autonomy: "Autonomy for the Lithuanians"
 WHR_establish_LIT_autonomy_desc: "In our quest to secure Vilnya, we have taken control of the Lithuanian heartland. We have no reason to oppress our Lithuanian brothers, so it would be wise to give them significant autonomy in internal affairs and perhaps rethink the overall administration of our state."
 WHR_form_litbel: "Form the Lithuanian-Belarusian Federation"
 WHR_form_litbel_desc: "The Lithuanian-Belarusian Federation is the final revival of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the shared legacy of our two nations. Such an idea had been briefly revived during the Weltkrieg, but was abandoned with the proclamations of the Kingdom of Lithuania and the Belarusian People's Republic. Now, however, recent events have proven that our very survival is dependent on deep cooperation, and this old idea will help both nations weather future storms. Long live the brotherly union of Lithuanian and Belarusian Peoples!"

 LIT_totalist_party:0 "Aušrinė"
 LIT_totalist_party_long:0 "Studentų socialistų aušrininkų draugija 'Aušrinė'\n§gThe Society of Socialist Students 'Aušrininkai' is a semi-formal student movement which first organised around the magazine Aušrinė ('Morning Star') in 1910. Not long after inception, it took a straight dive towards socialism, influence by Benoît Malon and Peter Kropotkin, and, ultimately, revolutionary syndicalism. It was forced out of schools and universities and ultimately banned by executive order in 1923, but continued spreading its ideas through the underground. Using dummy organisations to cover up their activities and publishing their magazine through ever changing names and titles, and sometimes taking up in left-wing terrorism, they remain a headache for any Lithuanian government. Aušrinė stands out among worldwide Syndicalist organisations by being a 'writers' party' - the absolute majority of their members are intellectuals, poets and writers, as such it is a lively community and their ideology is untainted, but they command little popular support.§!"

 LIT_radical_socialist_party:0 "LSDP"
 LIT_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Lietuvos socialdemokratų partija - Radikalusis sparnas\n§gNot all members of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania are 'soft' social democrats - plenty of them believe that merely reducing the negative effects of capitalism is not enough. The radical wing of the LSDP calls for no compromise with Lithuania's status as a monarchy, nor its domination by Germans, and instead looks towards France and other Syndicalist states as its potential saviours. Despite these radical stances, they maintain a constant presence in the party and hold significant influence over its leadership as well as ordinary membership.§!"
 LIT_radical_socialist_party2: "LVLS"
 LIT_radical_socialist_party2_long: "Lietuvos valstiečių liaudininkų sąjunga (Lithuanian People's Peasant Union)"

 LIT_social_democrat_party:0 "LSDP"
 LIT_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Lietuvos socialdemokratų partija\n§gThe Social Democratic Party of Lithuania is the largest party of the Lithuanian left wing and proudly calls itself the oldest political party in Lithuania. Its history stretches to 1896, although it only became a Lithuanian party foremost in 1902. Although the LSDP commanded great influence over the Lithuanian independence movement, it was forced out of the Council of Lithuania due to its republican stances, an act which many hold grudges for ever since. In the independent Kingdom of Lithuania, they have moderated their anti-monarchist position, but its condition as an anti-German, anti-capitalist party has allowed it to become a big tent movement for the Lithuanian left wing. The core of the party is influenced by the German SPD and Austromarxism, and while it remains a democratic party at heart, it does not disdain socialist or outright Syndicalist influence. This Petri dish of left-wing ideas collected to one organisation makes it rather difficult to achieve a consensus, however.§!"

 LIT_social_liberal_party:0 "KPL/LLK"
 LIT_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Lietuvos lenkų komitetas/Komitet Polaków na Litwie\n§gThe Committee of Lithuanian Poles is the largest of many ethnic minority parties in the Kingdom of Lithuania, originally founded in 1920 to contest the first democratic elections in the country. It is a party that unites Lithuanian Polish interests and campaigns for issues that matter to them first and foremost, such as cultural and political autonomy, funding of Polish language education in Suwałki and Vilnius regions, and deeper economic, cultural and political ties with Poland. Aside from these core issues, the party is largely non-ideological, the political positions of their members varying from aristocratic conservatism to near-Syndicalism.§!"

 LIT_market_liberal_party:0 "Santara"
 LIT_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Demokratinė tautos laisvės santara\n§gThe Democratic National Freedom League, more commonly known as just Santara, is a minor liberal political party in Lithuania which was first founded by many famous Lithuanian politicians in exile in 1917. Based in Petrograd, this party campaigned for Lithuania's future as a democratic republic and tied its future with the Entente, believing that Russian victory in the Eastern Front and Lithuanian autonomy within a greater Russian federation would be the best outcome for Lithuania as a whole. This never came to be, however, and Santara was thus cast out of any influence in building the foundations of the Kingdom. Santara is commonly known as the 'party of veterans'. Its leaders all became involved in politics before the Weltkrieg and were invited to hold ministries in various past governments, but the party does not command nearly as much influence among the population. It is an outlet for liberal ideas in Lithuania - Santara champions secularism, religious tolerance, liberalism, and sees itself as a mediator between the left and the right.§!"

 LIT_social_conservative_party:0 "LKDP"
 LIT_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Lietuvos krikščionių demokratų partija\n§gThe Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania is the largest party of the Lithuanian right wing, originally founded in 1917, although its predecessor movements are claimed to have started operating as early as 1890. A leading proponent of conservatism and monarchism in the Lithuanian political arena, it laid down the foundations for the Kingdom of Lithuania and has remained an extremely influential party since. Because of its vast size, the party has several distinct wings - some of its members are more willing to endorse liberal ideas and reconcile with the left, others are not; some see Lithuania's future as a loyal disciple of Germany, some are wary of being constantly reigned over by godless Lutherans, others are more nationalistic. Some are influenced by Christian corporatism or even Christian socialism, others are staunch conservatives or free market proponents. Regardless of the wing, however, ideas such as Christian ethics, monarchism, and democracy unite them all.§!"

 LIT_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "LTS"
 LIT_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Lietuvių tautininkų sąjunga\n§gThe Lithuanian Nationalist Union is the successor to the National Progress Party, founded in 1929, and holds the right-wing nationalist niche which the Christian Democrats have pretty much abandoned. The Nationalist Union unites around the larger than life persona of Antanas Smetona, once the head of the Council of Lithuania and the first Prime Minister of Lithuania, turned the leader of the Lithuanian nationalist cause. The failure of the Memel Uprising of 1928 taught Smetona that militant resistance against the Germans is futile, freedom from their grasp can only be achieved through the ballot, thus the Nationalist Union disdains any talks of armed rebellion and instead seek to implement their ideas (mostly) democratically. It believes in the need of a strong executive, in corporatist and state controlled economics, support for Lithuanian nationalism, and the ever present slogan of 'Lithuania for Lithuanians!'. Despite its professed allegiance to the King and Democracy, it comes into direct conflict with the Lithuanian left wing, which see them as a direct road towards authoritarianism.§!"

 LIT_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "TPP-N"
 LIT_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Naujoji Tautos pažangos partija\n§gAs the extreme members of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union have seized control of the party, moderate members of the party from an older extraction have chosen to split, restoring what they describe as the more moderate and aristocratic roots of the party - the Party of National Progress. Though still ethnic Lithuanian nationalist, it holds more moderate stances.§!"

 LIT_national_populist_party:0 "LAF"
 LIT_national_populist_party_long:0 "Lietuvos aktyvistų frontas\n§gThe Lithuanian Activist Front is an underground Lithuanian nationalist movement founded in 1930, in the aftermath of the Memel Uprising. It unites the radical, militant and reactionary forces of the Lithuanian political spectrum, those who cannot find a home in any legal political parties. Knowledge about how the movement operates is very scarce, but it is believed that they have no universally recognised leader and are split among several influential political visions - despite that, however, a unifying feeling of hatred towards Germany, the government in Vilnius, and non-Lithuanians keeps them from dissolving. They spread their ideology through magazines such as Vairas, Naujoji Romuva and Tautos Kelias, as well as organise protests, raids and occasional terrorist activity. It does not contest elections nor has it ever tried to, believing itself to be above the 'psychosis of democracy'.§!"

 LIT_paternal_autocrat_PLECH_long:0 "Plechavičius' Clique\n§gAfter the failure of the civilian government to prevent the death of King Mindaugas, General Povilas Plechavičius has stepped up and taken control of the government. Focused only on the survival and stability of Lithuania, he has no qualms about allies or methods."

 LIT_national_populist_wolf_party_long:0 "Geležinis Vilkas\n§gThe Iron Wolf, or 'Voldemarininkai' are followers of Augustinas Voldemaras and his militant and ultranationalist teachings. For a long time, they have formed the main part of the LAF's armed operations. The Iron Wolf's vision of a perfect Lithuanian state has been best expressed by one of the organisation's chief ideologues, cavalry officer Juozas Tomkus: 'The Weltkrieg and the years after have proven two things - that all wars from here on out will be won by not just arms and regular troops, but the mobilisation of the entire nation for war; and that Lithuania is destined to end up at war eventually, and anyone foolish enough to believe that these are times of peace has no place in the country. The only way for Lithuania to survive is for it to become an army - from the man in the front to the woman in the back, from the professor in the laboratories and worker in the factories, every single person and every single resource must be dedicated to national defence. Every single Lithuanian must be trained to wield a weapon and know his place in the armed nation. Such a nation will be completely unassailable and impossible to destroy.'§!"

 LIT_national_populist_vairas_party:0 "Vairas"
 LIT_national_populist_vairas_party_long:0 "Vairas\n§gVairas is a movement formed around writer Vytautas Alantas. Their main belief is the creation of a purely national ideology, one that would be entirely Lithuanian with no foreign elements, and so encompassing that Lithuanians would be liberated not only politically, but also culturally. Their Second National Revival will look back into Lithuania's pagan traditions, which, in Alantas's eyes, are the truest expression of Lithuanian national identity - it idealises a dream where the Lithuanian nation is subservient to a truly nationalist society under a single unquestioned leader, the Vadas, whose citizens are willing to give their life for the Nation, which worships traditions of time immemorial instead of 'the psychosis of democracy'. Despite their totalitarian intentions, it maintains liberal economic intentions, its leaders such as Domas Cesevičius expressing that a Lithuanian National Revival must create a society where every Lithuanian can achieve well-being through his own effort and individual innovation.§!"

 LIT_national_populist_romuva_party:0 "Naujoji Romuva"
 LIT_national_populist_romuva_party_long:0 "Naujoji Romuva\n§gNaujoji Romuva began as offspring within the Lithuanian Christian Democratic movement, but under Antanas Maceina they drifted into more radical politics. Inspired by integralism and distributism, the Young Catholic movement identifies its prime enemy as social and economic injustice. Maceina calls for radical land reform, redistribution of wealth and the uprooting of 'bourgeois-liberal thought' from the Lithuanian identity. Even the Catholic Church would not be safe from redistribution - after all, one can worship Christ without gold and silk, so why should the Church hold onto its wealth when there is so much suffering they could alleviate? In place of capitalism, they push forward a society of economic democracy and Christian corporatism. However, they challenge Syndicalists and social democrats alike by declaring that only an ethnically pure society can be socially and economically just. To them, Lithuania can only be Lithuanian, and a Lithuanian must live and die immersed in national and Catholic culture. While the Naujoji Romuva nominally believe in democracy, they also express that 'temporary' strong hand leadership is necessary and even mandatory to achieve all of their radical reforms.§!"

 ### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_VYTAUTAS_II_DESC:0 "'Scandal' roared Lithuanian newspapers in 1928, upon the reveal that the heir apparent of Lithuania was courting a woman beneath his station - to his younger brother, Karl Gero von Urach, this was the end of the world he knew, and the beginning of a horror show. A young man who had once dreamt of becoming an architect was now forced to leave his home in Wurttemberg to rule over a nation. And not just any nation - a nation poorer than the dinkiest German borough, divided between numerous ethnicities and religions and suffering numerous internal political, social and economic problems. Perhaps rightfully so, Mindaugas III has been seen as a weak and lethargic puppet of the Seimas, a tool of sycophants, and a laughing stock among European monarchs, ever since his coronation.\n\nIn truth, he is a man consumed by melancholy and crushed dreams. Though he has gained some experience in political operations during a decade of rule, there is nothing he yearns for more than a return to normalcy. A return to his passion for architecture, a return to his home in Germany. Only a strong feeling of duty to his father's will keeps him in the Verkiai Palace."

 LIT_MINDAUGAS_III_DESC:0 "The fourth and youngest son of the von Urach family, Eberhard could never have even hoped to become King of Lithuania one day. Having joined the Army as young man, he was chosen to lead the country over his more artistically inclined brother Albert, with his backers hoping he wil prove more conducive to their military-focused rule."

 POLITICS_STANISLAW_NARUTOWICZ_DESC:0 "Stanisław Narutowicz was the only member of the Council of Lithuania who signed its acts of independence in Polish, rather than Lithuanian, an action which has been interpreted numerous ways - but the one preferred by the elderly noble is that it is a sign that the Lithuanian cause is not just an ethnic Lithuanian or a peasant cause. The nobility and the Lithuanian Poles, such as himself, were just as critical to see an independent Lithuanian state arise. Narutowicz's political career has lasted for decades, starting with the Revolution of 1905, when he started the so-called 'Republic of Alsėdžiai' in the surroundings of his manor, and travelled across the Governorate to call people to the Great Seimas of Vilnius. Narutowicz was a member of the left faction of the Council of Lithuania and campaigned for a republic first and foremost, but ultimately conceded to the monarchist cause.\n\nThe leader of the Committee of Lithuanian Poles is perhaps the only Pole whom even Lithuanian nationalists, such as Antanas Smetona, respect - his efforts for an independent Lithuanian state are well known and so is his unyielding support for democracy, the rights of all minorities in Lithuania, and social justice."

 POLITICS_VACLOVAS_SIDZIKAUSKAS_DESC:0 ""

 POLITICS_STASYS_SALKAUSKIS_DESC:0 "Born to a family of petty nobility of mixed Polish and Lithuanian heritage, Stasys Šalkauskis had a modest upbringing, and was one of many in a new generation of Lithuanian speaking intellectuals from the last days of the Russian Empire. His profession of choice was law in the University of Moscow, a decision which would guide his path in life from there on out - experiencing the nihilist, atheist atmosphere of the Russian intelligentsia forced him to cling even more deeply to his Catholic faith, realising that its universalism and compassion, backed by reflective philosophy, is the best answer to the fundamental questions of life. These beliefs were reinforced by correspondence with Adomas Jakštas and studies in the Catholic university of Fribourg, in Switzerland.\n\nŠalkauskis is not a politician by trade and finds philosophy far more comfortable, but his complex vision of a new, compassionate Christian society has swayed many in the Christian Democratic Party. A drive towards an 'optimal system of government', a need for a government guided by solidarity and anti-capitalism, and a holistic interpretation of Lithuania as a synthesis of Eastern and Western culture are the main points of his ideology."

A committed nationalist, he advocated the national self-determination of Lithuania in Saint Petersburg; with the establishment of the German led Lithuanian puppet government following the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Voldemaras returned to his homeland to again fight for its independence. As head of state, Voldemaras is likely to pursue an ultra-nationalist agenda which promotes the superiority of the Lithuanian people and devotion to the state."

 POLITICS_LIT_PRIVY_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "Chaired by §YBaron Went von der Ropp§!\n\nIt is spoken by the inhabitants of the Pakruojis parish that the only thing which stood between Went von der Ropp and a fulfilled life was inheriting the Pakruojis Manor, the most famous and prestigious palace owned by the Lithuanian-German von der Ropp family - and, in fact, the young noble had dedicated his life and effort to managing the manor while its owner, Leon von der Ropp, was infirm and incapacitated. However, the elderly baron saw something threatening in the man, and with an excuse of not liking the young noble's spouse, he left Went out of the succession, leaving him with nothing but a small local holding and a noble title. It may only be a rumour, but it would explain the personality of Baron von der Ropp, a cunning, embittered, possibly even sociopathic man. \n\nHaving been admitted to the Privy Council of the King of Lithuania despite his youth, von der Ropp swiftly became a close associate of the King thanks to being the only member of the Council under forty years of age. He wielded his influence as the King's personal advisor to rise through the political arena, ultimately becoming the head of the Lithuanian-German Cultural Association (Kulturverband der Deutschen Litauen), a front for the influence of the German Empire in Lithuania. Holding no warm feelings towards Lithuanians - those impoverished, dirty, uncultured peasants, who threaten to nationalise his manor and end his way of life - von der Ropp looks to the West, dreaming of finishing the historical mission of the Teutonic Knights by attaching Lithuania to the German sphere, through force and blood if need be."

 LIT_GENERAL_RASTIKIS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 13th, 1896\nKuršėnai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWhen the Weltkrieg began, the eighteen year old Stasys Raštikis was one of the hundreds of thousands who volunteered for the Imperial Russian Army while overtaken by the war fever. Unlike many of his peers, however, the following four years of war did not erode this enthusiasm - in fact, it only strengthened it. The Russian officers in the Eastern Front and in the Tiflis Army Academy were quick to note the Lithuanian youth's enthusiasm. Upon the conclusion of hostilities in the East, Raštikis was in Georgia, where he and the rest of the Lithuanian cadets residing in the Academy received German approval to return to their homeland. He abandoned his former plans of becoming a priest in favour of pursuing a life in the military.\n\nAt forty years old, Raštikis is rather young considering his rank, but he is a bright and energetic mind, open to new ideas of warfare and loyal to his country. It is said that the bald, stern-faced General is the most politically powerful of all Lithuanian army commanders - he has close ties to the Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania and is a personal friend of Leonas Bistras, while at the same time, he is married to Elena Smetonaitė, the niece of Antanas Smetona. Those claiming that he exerts any influence from the shadows are merely repeating conspiracies, however - dedicated to the military and the good of his country, Raštikis professes complete independence from any political affairs."

It is not even sure whether his parents are actually Lithuanian, or whether they had immigrated to Lithuania sometime during the 19th century. A Lutheran Protestant married to a Baltic German noble Josephine Hasdorf, he was a cavalry officer in the Imperial Russian Army, reaching the rank of Major General in 1916. He crossed the Soviet-German border in 1918, after the October Revolution, and was appointed the first Chief of Staff of the Lithuanian armed forces, holding this position for over a decade.\n\nThough elderly and reclusive, Silvestras Žukauskas holds insurmountable respect among his fellow Lithuanian officers, and still occasionally offers advice for his younger peers - even though, over the years, the armed forces under his command started to steadily degrade and Žukauskas struggled to garner the initiative for reform."

 LIT_GENERAL_CERNIUS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJanuary 6th, 1898\nKupiškis, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe call for volunteers to the Lithuanian Army reached Jonas Černius, the son of a bricklayer, while he was still enrolled in the Panevėžys Gymnasium, but that did not stop him from abandoning his past life in order to become one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian Army. He was handpicked as one of the few soldiers in the Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces to further their military education in Berlin, where he became a military engineer - perhaps because he inherited his father's passion for construction and building. During these studies, he became acquainted with Stasys Raštikis, who had also been sent to Berlin as a part of the Lithuanian mission, and the two of them became close allies. Wherever Raštikis proposes reforms and changes to the Lithuanian army, Černius is sure to follow suit, the two generals united by nationalist pride and loyal service to their fatherland."

 LIT_GENERAL_SKIRPA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 18th, 1895\nNabajūnai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in the northernmost reaches of Lithuania, Škirpa never once questioned his Lithuanian identity, unlike several of his peers, and proudly declared himself to be a patriot since the earliest days. The February Revolution in Russia saw him, an officer stationed in Omsk, travel across the entirety of the disintegrating Empire, through hardship and danger, until he reached Vilnius in the first half of 1918. Seeing the Council of Lithuania paralysed and the Germans have free reign in his homeland disappointed him, however. Against the will of the Council and the Ober Ost administration, he organised a Lithuanian volunteer unit in Vilnius, engaging in street clashes with Polish paramilitaries and raising the flag of Lithuania atop the Gediminas Tower on January 1st, 1919, before it was taken down by German authorities the day after.\n\nDespite this futile resistance, he ended up acquitted and became one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian army. It is suspected that Lt. General Škirpa had a hand in organising the Memel Uprising as well, but all that can be said against him is hearsay and rumours. It is a fact, however, that Škirpa is by far the most right wing and nationalist of the Lithuanian high command, holding no warm feelings towards the German occupation he once fought, nor the Poles he has had bad blood with since 1918."

 LIT_GENERAL_REKLAITIS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 6th, 1896\nDaugirdėliai, Suwałki Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in the Alytus region and known among his fellow generals for his strong Dzūkijan accent, Mikas Rėklaitis did not initially wish to be a military officer. He was conscripted to the Imperial Russian Army upon finishing education in the Veiveriai Seminary and served until January of 1918, when he was taken prisoner by advancing German forces and remained in captivity for most of the year. He was freed in November of 1918 and began organising self-defence units in his home region. These units ended up integrated into the nascent Lithuanian army and Rėklaitis accepted his new career in life. Among other things, he is responsible for the drafting of the Infantry Unit Organisation Statute of the Lithuanian army in 1923, and has remained a firm supporter of the role of the foot soldier on the battlefield since."

 LIT_GENERAL_VITKAUSKAS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 4th, 1890\nUžbaliai, Suwałki Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nVincas Vitkauskas was not drawn to a life of war at first. A bright mind and an artistic soul, he was a maths student and a poet before getting conscripted to the Imperial Russian Army - this origin reflects itself in Vitkauskas's texts and memoirs, which always use vivid, expressive language, unusual for an army officer. After two years of service in Ukraine, he returned to his homeland once again, where he signed up for Lithuania's armed forces - there, he gained the reputation of a lenient, socialite commander, who preferred to win the hearts and minds of his men instead of instilling discipline to them through force.\n\nVitkauskas's career in the Lithuanian army has been difficult. Unlike many of his fellow politically neutral officers, he does not shy away from the fact that he disapproves of the Christian Democrats and the Nationalist Union, and holds progressive political views. This has led to him being passed over for promotion several times in his past - only the intervention of Stasys Raštikis ensured that he would finally acquire the rank of Major General he was worthy of in 1935."

 LIT_GENERAL_ZELIGOWSKI_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 17th, 1865\nAšmena/Oszmiana/Ashmiany, Vilna Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLike many of his fellow Lithuanian commanders, Lucjan Żeligowski started his career in the Imperial Russian Army - the difference is that, upon the fall of the Tsarist regime, he swore not to the nascent Kingdom of Lithuania, but rather to the Polish nation next door. Commanding the 4th Polish Rifle Division in Kuban, he ultimately became the supreme commander of all Polish volunteer units in the Russian Civil War, fighting alongside the Whites in southern and eastern Russia. Żeligowski finally crossed the Russian-German border in 1919, but what he saw shattered his dreams - the Polish nation he sought to fight for had been reduced to a shadow of its former self, beset by political instability, and holding but a smidgen of all of its rightful land. His friend Jozef Piłsudski was imprisoned by the Kaiser's minions and Poles kowtowed to Berlin's will.\n\nDefeated, Żeligowski put aside the dreams of unified Polish people for now, and focused on the task at hand - to speak for the Poles in Lithuania, and to strive for Lithuania where Poles are free to express their culture - and perhaps, one day, unite with their brothers in south."

 LIT_GENERAL_LADIGA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 25th, 1893\nIškonys, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nKazys Ladiga's military career started with his service as a reconnaissance scout in the Imperial Russian Army - for his bravery and several wounds he endured, he was awarded the Cross of St. George. He was one of the few Lithuanian officers who did not defect after the February Revolution - instead, he remained in service until February of 1918, when he and his entire unit were taken prisoner by advancing German forces in Dunaburg. Ladiga remained imprisoned for almost a year until he was found by Konstantinas Olšauskas, a delegate from the Council of Lithuania, and bailed out in order to join the developing Lithuanian armed forces.\n\nKazys Ladiga is a staunch abstinent and Christian, but suffers from nefarious voices claiming that he is a communist sympathiser - after all, he remained in the Russian Army even after the October Revolution, unlike his peers, who defected as soon as the military began to disintegrate."

 LIT_GENERAL_ADAMKAVICIUS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 30th, 1888\nPikeliai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nIt is said that Aide-de-Camp Edvardas Adamkavičius, serving in the 64th Kazan Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army in 1915, was responsible for reviewing the lists of newly recruited officers. Among this list, he saw one or two Lithuanian surnames - and immediately reached out to those men to speak to them only in Lithuanian from then on out. A stalwart Lithuanian nationalist and a respected general, Adamkavičius was one of the first volunteers in the Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces upon his return in November of 1918. Though of somewhat poor health, owing to miraculously surviving a bullet going through his head during the Weltkrieg, the moustached general commands great respect from his peers and junior officers."

 LIT_GENERAL_PLECHAVICIUS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 1st, 1890\nŽidikai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nPovilas Plechavičius hails from a family of wealthy farmers in Samogitia. Upon the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, he was a cavalry officer in the Imperial Russian Army and fought in the Eastern and Caucasus Fronts, reportedly getting wounded twenty nine times, and yet returning for more every single time. The October Revolution found him while he was stationed in the Caucasus, but did not discourage him one bit - posing as a Cossack, he joined Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army and fought alongside the Whites against the Bolshevik uprising in the Russian south. Though his service there was brief, it instilled Plechavičius with a deep and seething hatred for communism - alongside his brother Aleksas, he returned to Lithuania in the fall of 1918.\n\nPlechavičius found Lithuania in chaos and disorder, infested with bandits and Bolshevik sympathisers, where the German authorities held a tenuous grip. He organised a band of Samogitian men, which soon grew into an army, and enacted a policy of White terror in northern and western Lithuania. Though his methods were effective in restoring order in his home, even receiving tacit German authority approval, the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania was horrified by the brutality. Threatened by the Social Democratic deputy Liuda Purėnienė with legal action, Plechavičius defended himself simply: 'Honourable justices, if me or a person like me weren't there at the time, none of us would be sitting here today'. He was acquitted, albeit controversially, and became a folk hero among the Lithuanian military."

The Seimas, according to the project, shall be divided into three Houses - a universally elected 'House of Ideological Communities', a 'Little Seimas' composed of Federal representatives, and a 'House of Corporations' directly elected from trade unions, business owners, and agricultural communities. Each of the three Houses of the Seimas will appoint five ministries, all of whom will be controlled by the State Control Commission and finally overseen by the King.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the project is to form an 'optimal state', one where the voice of any citizen is heard, one whose inhabitants identify with 'Lithuania' as a concept rather than one of many numerous ethnic groups, much like they had in the Grand Duchy centuries past.\n\nThis state, according to Šalkauskis's vision, will serve as a bridge between East and West and lead all of humanity to a new age.\n\n§CFederalisation Progress§!: [?LIT_federalisation|0+]%"

 LIT_seaplanes:0 "Seaplanes"
 LIT_seaplanes_desc:0 "An interesting proposal from Gustaitis is the intertwining between the navy and the airforce. As our navy lacks any major heavy warships to damage enemy fleets, we can instead fit planes for sea travel to ensure that they can act as naval bombers.

### Events ###
 LIT.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania"
 LIT.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania was officially founded on December 11th, 1917, and this declaration was reiterated on February 16th, 1918, by the Council of Lithuania, a body of Lithuanian politicians and public figures elected in the Vilnius Conference during the Weltkrieg. The formation of the Kingdom was far from easy, however - the declaration split Lithuanian nationalists and forced the republican-leaning Social Democrats (LSDP) out of the Council, while it only took until 1919 for the Germans to take the declaration of independence seriously. Ultimately, they confirmed Wilhelm von Urach as Mindaugas II, the first King of Lithuania since 1263.\n\nThe Constitution of 1920 established Lithuania as a bicameral constitutional monarchy, guaranteeing basic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and universal suffrage. To this day, it remains one of the most liberal constitutions in the Reichspakt. Lacking serious competition, the Christian Democrats (LKDP) have formed the government since the country's inception, while the economy of the country remains dominated by German Junkers and company branches. The absolute majority of them are established in Vilnius, declared a city for 'German Development' - the lion's share of foreign investment is directed there and it has become a jewel of the Oststaaten, a place where you can hear five different languages on your way from the grocery shop. The rest of Lithuania is underdeveloped, however. This is most obvious in the so-called 'Outer Lithuania', the Slavic-speaking southern districts, which, more often than not, look like they are stuck in the 19th century.\n\nMindaugas III, also known as Karl Gero von Urach, is the King of Lithuania since 1928. The incumbent Prime Minister is Leonas Bistras, representing the Christian Democrats."
 LIT.1.a:0 "More..."
 LIT.1.b:0 "I already know this"

 LIT.2.t:0 "Memory of the Memel Uprising"
 LIT.2.d:0 "Nationalism in Lithuania, briefly quenched by the declaration of independence at the end of the Weltkrieg, saw a resurgence during the 1920s. The laws of free expression allowed a revival of Lithuanian culture - numerous nationalist inclined arts and culture movements began to appear, the Prussian Lithuanian philosopher Vilhelmas Storosta-Vydūnas initiated a revival of the old Lithuanian faith, and dissatisfaction with Lithuania's Oststaat status started to rise. These nationalists started to rally around the Party of National Progress (TPP) - a minor nationalist party founded in 1916 and led by Antanas Smetona, one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence, who ended up sidelined after independence due to his conflict with the Christian Democrats.\n\nIn 1928, upon the death of Mindaugas II, Lithuanian nationalists sought to take advantage of the disorder and seize Vilnius and Klaipėda. The attack on Vilnius never took place, while the one on Klaipėda became known as the 'Memel Uprising' or 'Memel Massacre', resulting in the death of 50 armed militiamen at the hands of the German garrison. Smetona distanced himself from the uprising, the TPP dissolved under the public backlash and reformed to the Nationalist Union (LTS), while the event became a rallying moment for Lithuanian nationalism.\n\nNowadays, Lithuanian nationalists remain split between two approaches. Those rallied around Antanas Smetona and the 'moderate' LTS believe that it is possible to achieve a second National Revival through democratic means. Others have become disillusioned with what they perceive as a sham, however. Uniting the most radical and extreme strands of Lithuanian nationalism is the informal movement known as the Activist Front (LAF)."
 LIT.2.a:0 "More..."

 LIT.3.t:0 "The Government of Leonas Bistras"
 LIT.3.d:0 "Representing the Christian Democrats (LKDP), Leonas Bistras is the fifth Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lithuania, appointed after the election of 1933. A doctor by profession, Bistras is an active member and chairman of the Party and, as expected of the Christian Democrats, a devout Catholic. Since the beginning of his term, Lithuania has experienced economic growth thanks to growth in Germany and Lithuania's close ties to its economy, as well as education reforms. This economic growth means that the Bistras cabinet is confident in its stability enough to consider projects once seen as nothing but impossible dreams, such as acquiring Lithuania's own port or organising land reform.\n\nDespite this, it is expected that this will be the last time the Christian Democrats head a majority government alone. Minority parties, such as the Committee of Poles in Lithuania (LLK) and the Jewish Labour Bund (Bundas), are growing stronger, and so are the Social Democrats (LSDP), having recovered their strength after the slump in the 1920s. Finally, the growth of Lithuanian nationalism has culminated in the Nationalist Union (LTS) becoming a serious challenge to the establishment. Though dismissed as a party of violent radicals, their leader, Antanas Smetona, is committed to achieving his vision through democratic means.\n\nWith the planet drawing closer to... something, it remains to be seen where Lithuania shall turn."
 LIT.3.a:0 "Už Tėvynę!"

 LIT.6.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Lithuania"
 LIT.6.d:0 "The German stock exchange has crashed and its rippled effect is beginning to be felt in Lithuania, especially in the capital. German-run businesses seem to be laying off people en masse causing a slow rise in unemployment. The full extent of the crisis has yet to be measured, but only misery and woe is sure to follow."
 LIT.6.a:0 "O Dieve..."

 LIT.7.t:0 "Big Troubles in Little Suwałki"
 LIT.7.d:0 "Suwałki, like the rest of the Kingdom, hasn't been spared from the brunt of the effects of Black Monday. This has further aggravated tensions between the Lithuanian Polish and Jewish communities within the city. This has stemmed from the Jewish businesses being able to weather the effects of Black Monday due to their tight knit community and Polish Jewish Bund affiliations. As a result, many Polish businesses have gone under, and in some cases being bought by their Jewish counterparts, serving as a further slap to the face.\n\nMany have turned to Stanisław Narutowicz, the leader of the Committee of Lithuanian Poles, desperate for some form of relief from the situation. After a short meeting, Narutowicz with other Lithuanian Polish leaders have stated that they would need to turn to Vilnius for support and this could mean a reduction in autonomy in the region."
 LIT.7.a:0 "Of course, we will support all in the Kingdom in this time of need."
 LIT.7.b:0 "They are on their own..."

 LIT.8.t:0 "A Form of Normality Restored"
 LIT.8.d:0 "With the Government providing limited aid to Suwałki, a level of normality has been restored in the city. The tension between the Poles and the Jewish population has dropped in the city, with people just trying to get on with their lives as opposed to ruining their neighbours. With this small gesture, the Polish community within Suwałki are slowly starting to look to Vilnius for aid as opposed to Warsaw. Time will tell how Suwałki weathers the storm."
 LIT.8.a:0 "Well that's one spot fire extinguished."

 LIT.9.t:0 "Suwałki Turns to Warsaw"
 LIT.9.d:0 "With the Government not wishing to support the Lithuanian Poles in their time of need, they have looked to other avenues to help recover. This had lead to them reaching out to those in Warsaw with sympathetic ears and small enterprise been set up in the city to assist those Lithuanian Poles in need. The growing resentment towards the Jewish community has boiled over resulting in several Jewish owned businesses being targeted by arsonists, who were heard shouting in thick Masovian accents denouncing the Bund and comparing them to syndicalists. Order was restored quickly, though the offenders have seemed to have disappeared into the night, with rumours circulating that the arsonists weren't locals. The following morning, it is evident that the Poles in Suwałki are looking away from Vilnius and towards Warsaw for their needs."
 LIT.9.a:0 "It's one thing after another with those insufferable Poles."

 LIT.10.t:0 "Cracks in the Bund"
 LIT.10.d:0 "General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania has a turbulent history, to say the less. Formed in 1897, the Bund promotes the idea of a 'Nation in a Nation', with it strongly advocating for the use of the Yiddish language as a Jewish national language and promote Socialist ideals that borderline Syndicalism in their nature.\n\nThe first split was when Lithuania was annexed by Germany from the Russian Empire, resulting in the Bund seceding from the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia. Now a second split is occurring with the Litvaks (Lithuanian Jews) and Polish Jews in Suwałki butting heads over the direction of the Bund. The Litvak community generally wish to promote the Nation with a Nation idea and there are those who wish to become more politically active as opposed to the Polish Jews, with Zionism gaining traction amongst its community and the promotion of Hebrew over Yiddish. With the no common ground to be found between the two groups, the Bund has further fragmented between those in the South and those in the North."
 LIT.10.a:0 "Wait, how does this affect the steel works in Suwałki?"

 LIT.11.t:0 "Reaction of the Bistras Government"
 LIT.11.d:0 "The Black Monday and the ensuing economic crisis has left the country completely unprepared. The government of Leonas Bistras operated with the belief that the Tirpitz golden era will outlast them, and thus did not build up a sufficient money reserve to counter the crisis. An emergency session of the cabinet has been summoned to consider all possible solutions for recovery.\n\nThe summit has sharpened the long present divisions within the Christian Democrats. A growing wing of the party finds itself enthralled by the ideas proposed by the professor and Christian ideologue Stasys Šalkauskis, a proponent of democratic corporatism and federal devolution of the Kingdom. This 'Federalist' wing believes that assuring autonomy from the German markets and rallying the trust of the people in corporate economics can help weather the crisis.\n\nPrime Minister Bistras is not willing to throw the Germans under the bus, however. He and the old guard of the party have instead drawn up a series of initiatives known as the 'Galvanauskas Plan', named after our Minister of Finance. This plan involves the development of a sustained industrial heartland in Vilnius and Kaunas and bailing out the worst off of the German Junkers to keep foreign capital flowing into the country.\n\nThe announcement of this plan has not resonated well with the Lithuanian people, however. The inhabitants of the Southern regions, so-called 'Outer Lithuania', protest this abandonment, and so do the Social Democrats and the Nationalist Union. In their eyes, this reliance on German investors is what caused the crisis in the first place. The first results of the injected surplus seem to be positive, however."
 LIT.11.a:0 "Let's see how it goes."

 LIT.12.t:0 "German Investors Abandon Lithuania"
 LIT.12.d:0 "The Galvanauskas Plan has not yielded the results which the government has sought - German businesses and investors continue abandoning the Lithuanian market. Their companies are liquidating what little assets they have left and are putting their facilities on sale in order to recoup at least some of their losses.\n\nNature does not tolerate a vacuum, however, and other actors are starting to take advantage of this investor flight. In Vilnius, several of the most notable companies have been purchased by Jewish business owners, unions and worker cooperatives, many of them in cooperation with Lithuanian and Polish entrepreneurs. The Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, wielding its influence within the community and especially among Jewish labour unions, several of whom it directly operates, helped orchestrate these buyouts. Native companies in Kaunas and Suwałki, Lithuanian and Polish respectively, have begun buying out former German assets at a low price, seeking to wrest control of the market from German competitors after having been suppressed for many years by not so clean business practices.\n\nThe transition has been far from soft, however. Thousands of workers in Lithuanian cities have been laid off and are starting to radicalise. The local companies organise these buyouts with pretty much all of the remaining assets they have, leaving their future uncertain - and, in fact, many of these freshly established cooperatives and companies are reported to declare bankruptcy in the following weeks. Should we cling onto our guns, our economy will go through this transition and come out more independent - however, when it is so painful and so difficult, will we even be able to weather the storm?"
 LIT.12.a:0 "The longer term is what matters."

 LIT.13.t:0 "Call for Land Reform"
 LIT.13.d:0 "The question of land reform was one which the first governments of Lithuania had failed to answer. In the aftermath of the Weltkrieg, many of the manors across Lithuania ended up abandoned and ripe for taking - the Polish nobility started repatriating, and Russian nobles fled for their homeland. Radically-minded members of the legislature called for distributing the land to the poor and the landless, and this measure was even endorsed by several members of the Christian Democrats, such as Mykolas Krupavičius, who saw this as a way to stifle the growth of socialism among the peasantry. Ultimately, however, no consensus was reached and many of the abandoned manors were bought out by Germans at a low price. Large agribusinesses established themselves in the Lithuanian countryside, causing resentment among the landless peasantry and even serving as a way for some German families to settle down in Lithuanian territory.\n\nBlack Monday has changed the situation in the countryside, however. Many of the formerly thriving conglomerates are now desperately trying to sell their land, even at the lowest possible price, and pull out from the country to save operations in their homeland. This presents an opportunity for the Lithuanian government to step in, buy out the land and ensure a fairer distribution of land ownership in the countryside."
 LIT.13.a:0 "Change is needed, then."

 LIT.14.t:0 "Nationalist Union Rallies"
 LIT.14.d:0 "The news of growing Bundas influence in the Vilnius industrial hub and other major cities have begun to rouse major dissent among the population. This dissent is, first and foremost, raised by the Lithuanian Nationalist Union (LTS). Their deputies in the Seimas, most notably Antanas Smetona, have begun speaking out against the transition of industry in Vilnius, and have lodged bill after bill trying to break this monopoly. Younger, more active and frustrated members of the Party have taken matters into their own hands, however, and started organising mass protest rallies across cities such as Kaunas, Šiauliai and Vilnius.\n\nTheir anti-semitism is thinly-veiled, if hidden at all - these nationalists call for a 'Lithuania for Lithuanians' and their marches, more often than not, devolve into violence, such as vandalism of German or Jewish owned shop fronts or, in some cases, direct assault against peaceful citizens. The following sparked a harsh reaction from the Constabularies - several of the most radical activists were detained, while additional police officers were dispatched to ensure order in the cities.\n\nImmediately upon the conclusion of this nationalist fever, eyes were turned towards the leaders of the Nationalist Union, Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras. Both of them handled the situation tactfully, however. Smetona publicly denounced the actions of what he described as 'loose cannons barely affiliated with his party'. Voldemaras was under police investigation due to suspicions of having a hand in these actions, but they were cut short and Voldemaras himself expressed his support for the stance of his party's leader."
 LIT.14.a:0 "Doubt besets me..."

 LIT.15.t:0 "Recovering German Business"
 LIT.15.d:0 "After a period of falling out, a small upsurge of investment in Lithuanian businesses by German investors has been registered. Soon enough, the Seimas has received a petition from several of their companies, requesting a second chance. They promise that, if they are provided with grants, loans and preferential status in the Lithuanian market, they promise to maintain operations in Lithuanian territory and provide employment for their citizens, helping us recover from Black Monday."
 LIT.15.a:0 "I suppose Germans have their uses."

 LIT.16.t:0 "Nationalist Marches Continue"
 LIT.16.d:0 "Nationalist activism has been continuing across Lithuanian cities for months, sparked by poor economic conditions, the Government's perceived reliance on German interests, dissatisfaction with Jewish dominance over the Lithuanian sector, and Lithuania's status as one of the Oststaaten. However, as time passes, it seems that the initial hostility raised by the riots seems to have faded. No more cases of violence or vandalism are being reported and even some of the most unsavoury slogans have been dropped in favour of more moderate ones, though they still call for expanding Lithuanian autonomy and ensuring Lithuanians as the superior ethnicity in the Kingdom. Any and all ideas of acting against the LTS have had to be dropped for now.\n\nThe Nationalist Union has been running a very strong campaign in general. Despite his advanced age, Antanas Smetona has been campaigning everywhere from Palanga to Vilnius, and so have all of his underlings, each of them offering an alternative to Syndicalism and Christian conservatism alike, a strong, national rule, free from the shackles of foreigners, a chance for Lithuania to carve its own fate. For the first time since its founding, the Nationalist Union may provide a challenge to the established parties in the election."
 LIT.16.a:0 "What is that old fox up to?"

 LIT.17.t:0 "Palanga Agreement"
 LIT.17.d:0 "In 1920, the first democratically elected government of Lithuania was forced to sign a punitive agreement regarding the trade flowing in and out of the country. According to the terms of the agreement, all Lithuanian foreign trade must flow through the ports of Memel, Libau and Riga, all three of which controlled by Germany and the Baltic Duchy. The agreement also stipulates harsh restrictions on the types of production which are allowed to be traded through the ports, and several types of tolls. Ultimately, it means that Lithuanian foreign trade is severely restricted and reliant on the German whim.\n\nOne of the campaign promises of Leonas Bistras and the LKDP was to re-negotiate the agreement and 'carve Lithuania out a window to the West', and now they are ready to act upon this promise. Palanga, Lithuania's sole town on the coast of the Baltic Sea, holds the potential of becoming an adequate port, if only the Germans allow to ease restrictions on local docks and shipbuilding. While preparations for the diplomatic mission are ongoing, our Ambassador to the German Empire, Jurgis Šaulys, offers support in the form of contacts among German businessmen and diplomats - of course, this would come with a price."
 LIT.17.a:0 "No, this must be seen as a Lithuanian effort."
 LIT.17.b:0 "How much is it going to be then, Hans?"

 LIT.18.t:0 "A Lithuanian Envoy"
 LIT.18.d:0 "An envoy has arrived from Lithuania, wishing to invite representatives from our government to negotiate a new trade agreement. Currently, due to the treaty of Brest-Litovsk and our subsequent agreements, we have restricted Lithuanian trade from the Baltic Sea, their goods either go through Memel or Riga. It now appears they wish to have unrestricted access to the Baltic Sea, circumventing Memel and Riga."
 LIT.18.a:0 "Very well."
 LIT.18.b:0 "No, we shall keep the restrictions."

 LIT.19.t:0 "The Palanga Agreement"

Surprisingly, their German peers were passive, agreeing to several of the requests which had initially been thrown forward as a half-joke, and ultimately, the summit concluded with Germany agreeing to lift restrictions on our naval trade.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the negotiations, however, it soon became apparent exactly why the German diplomatic mission had been this passive. A powerful economic crash has shackled the Empire and the rest of the Reichspakt, and its ripples have reached Lithuania as well. German investors are closing down industries and pulling out of the country, the nation is shackled by mass unemployment, and the government is completely unprepared for the crisis.\n\nWe have solved one problem only to be faced with hundreds more."

 LIT.21.t:0 "Victor Alter - a new leader of the Bundas"
 LIT.21.d:0 "Arkadi Kremer, the long time leader of the Jewish community in Lithuania and rightful bearer of the title 'Father of the Bund', has passed. His contributions to the Bundist movement and the left-wing movement in the Russian Empire in general cannot be understated, and neither can his efforts to reestablish the General Labour Bund in Vilnius after the end of the Weltkrieg. At the end of his life, he has seen the Bundas achieve the apogee of its power in Lithuania thanks to Black Monday, and could give away the reins of the organisation in peace. His successor is Victor Alter, a youthful Jewish labour activist and leader of the left wing of the Bundas.\n\nVictor Alter immediately took the Bundas in a new direction. While his predecessor was wary of involving the Jewish community in politics and instead opted to just endorse policies most beneficial to their members, Alter is a strong supporter of the Social Democratic Party and an opponent of the growing current of anti-semitic nationalism. This has culminated in an official agreement between the LSDP and the Bundas. The Bundas has offered its funds to the Social Democrat campaign and agreed to a coalition ticket - several Jewish labour leaders shall stand under the Social Democratic Banner in their constituencies, and all Lithuanian Jews are encouraged to support this joint ticket in the next elections.\n\nThough the right wing has begun crying out about 'Jewish syndicalist infiltration of the LSDP', they can only concede that the leader of the Social Democrats, Steponas Kairys, has made a yet another successful move."

Faced with successful campaigns from the LSDP and LTS alike, an emergency meeting of the Christian Democratic party has been held to formulate a response. In the meeting, the Prime Minister was blamed for an inability to predict an economic downturn and failing to prevent the party's rivals from taking advantage of the downturn. Bistras tried to defend himself to the best of his ability - and, ultimately, as a sudden new speaker declared, the blame rests on everyone's shoulders. Decades of unchallenged leadership have left the party complacent and unwilling to present something anew.\n\nThis speaker was Stasys Šalkauskis, a Lithuanian professor and ideologue, the founder of democratic, federal corporatism in Lithuania, which he dubs the 'Optimal System'. Though he has only been a member of the party for a few years and only entered politics recently, he had already gathered a strong base of support from young, active members of the party. Šalkauskis presented the tenets of his program, calling for a corporatist, integral economical and political system, and reconciliation with Lithuania's numerous ethnic groups under a federal democratic government. The ultimate goal of the 'Optimal System' would be a nation where all of its members can live up to Christian teaching and values, where everyone's voice is heard in the government and where everyone knows they contribute to a greater whole.\n\nLacking the stamina or the charisma to try to sway the mass of the party back to the old guard, Bistras opted to concede, allowing Šalkauskis to speak for the duration of the meeting."

Since then, it has consistently scored the districts in the Suwałki region, and Polish-majority neighbourhoods in Vilnius such as Naujoji Vilnia. The venerable leader of the Committee is Stanisław Narutowicz, one of the signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania - due to his age, experience and non-confrontational attitude, he is respected not just by Lithuanian Poles, but by many Lithuanians as well.\n\nAs the election of 1937 of approaches, the Committee has strengthened its grip over the Suwałki region, and its endorsement may be critical in winning the election."

Of course, the Nationalists are uninterested in such an idea entirely.\n\nThe Social Democrats have long been endorsing the idea of pluralism - granting wide cultural autonomy to all of the ethnic groups within Lithuania, promoting multiculturalism and socialist internationalism, and though most of the members of the Committee are put off by the idea of Syndicalism or even democratic socialism, the idea of pluralism eludes them. Stanisław Narutowicz has received a personal phone call from Steponas Kairys, the leader of the LSDP, offering cooperation in the electoral campaign and a coalition afterwards.\n\nHowever, the Christian Democrats have not been any less active in enticing the Polish vote. Now led by Stasys Šalkauskis, they reach out to several high ranking members among the party, explaining their program of federalisation and offering autonomy greater than the Social Democrats could ever promise.

As naval officer Povilas Julius Labanauskas would later write in his memoirs, they had to use a yellow sheet as a base for the flag and paint the necessary colours in less than twenty minutes before authorities from the headquarters showed up, so they had to make do with what they had - and as the Chief of Staff arrived, he witnessed not the Lithuanian green and red bicolour flying in front, but a yellow-green-red tricolour, as the top third of the flag had not gotten painted in time. One of the officers almost immediately compared the flag to that of Ethiopia, calling it 'something African', but Raštikis's opinion was different - he played along, called it 'a quaint banner' and gave the Lithuanian Naval Force the permission to adopt the tricolour as their symbol.\n\nThough born out of a complete mistake, the Yellow-Green-Red Tricolour has become the flag of the Lithuanian Naval Force - even if it will forever remain the butt end of jokes."

The church survived many of the disasters and occupations that betide Vilnius, though it appears it couldn't survive the ruling of the Russian Tsars with an order for it to be demolished in 1877. Since then it appears a market of sorts was meant to be installed, though it appears the Weltkrieg and then the German occupation of the city put an end to that. With this in mind, the King saw this as a new challenge and immediately began his work on restoring the old church."

The Church itself features your usual features in a Catholic church, though with a Lithuanian influence, with its use of unquiet Lithuanian cross design. A petition has been forwarded to the King to ensure he keeps this design and not 'add upon' it.\n\nThe King did wish to add a 'Bavarian' flair to the Church and do away with these near pagan crosses on the church as such a thing wouldn't occur in Germany. Torn between what the people expect and what designs he has already laid out, the King must decide on the design."

It appears the petition only represented the Lithuanian community within Vilnius, which has slowly begun to grow since 1918 but is still the smallest minority in the city. Poles, Belarusians and other communities appeared to show little interest in the event, though Bundas representative was present to the surprise of many. The design of the church itself completely restored the church to its original humble form, though with modern comforts added like power and plumbing. A small plaque was placed at the front of the Church with its brief history explained as a reminder to rule under the Russian Tsar."

After more consultation with Salomėja, he decided to keep one Lithuanian cross on the nave's roof, with the other two taking a more traditional approach. On the day of its opening, it appears the crowd of mixed cultures and creeds had mixed feelings about its new design. It didn't favour any one culture within the city and for all intents and purposes was just a Church. Further to this, a Bundas representative was present to the surprise of many and seemed to approve. The King was to find out later that the petition only represented the Lithuanian minority in the city and following its recommendations would be a clear favouritism, regardless of his nativity."

Wilhelm's regal name, Mindaugas II, was chosen after the first and only King of Lithuania, though unlike his Lithuanian predecessor, did not earn his crown via conquest and court intrigue, but by a vote.\n\nMany expected the newly crowned King to be at best another German King who didn't care about the going-ons of his Kingdom and at worst, a monarch similar to the Polish Commonwealth Kings of old. What they got to their surprise was a King, who was firm in the belief that a monarch is there to serve his people. and one that learned the language and traditions of his land. Though he was still a puppet King, he ensured that Berlin's interference in Lithuania was a minimal, with one act being his support Vilnius being declared as a 'Development City', in an attempt to curb the German dominance on his Kingdom.\n\nThe few vices of the late King was his unwavering views on tradition and royal protocols. This was famously proven when Mindaugas refused to accept his son's engagement to a woman beneath his status, resulting in Wilhelm abdicating the throne, and Karl Gero being trusted as the heir apparent to a Kingdom he knew little of. Unlike his brother, Karl had no wish to guide a nation, but wished to design buildings having finished his studies as an architect. After being wounded heavily in the Weltkrieg and now reinvigorated to show his subjects, the King sets about design a memorial to his late father, with the city of Valkaviskas selected as he seemed to always enjoy its humble streets and its charming people."

Though the sudden influx of people is beginning to strain the city's infrastructure due to its lack of sanitation and electoral infrastructure, which is could hamper the completion time of the memorial.\n\nIn an audience with the Mayor of Valkaviskas, he has requested of the King further funding to accommodate this sudden boom of population. Though the benefits of this funding would result in the expansion of Valkaviskas and the steady growth of jobs, it would have the King going over several heads of Government, which goes against the supposed 'natural order' of things and could cause a stir with the [From.GetRulingParty] and the current head of state, opposed to the King requesting such funding be made available, which is a drawn-out process."

 LIT.74.d:0 "Born Ludwik Władysław Franciszek Kondratowicz in the village of Smolków, Władysław Syrokomla was one of the great romantic poets of the 19th century. Despite his short life, Syrokomla's poems (written mainly in Polish) resonate deeply among Lithuanians as an example of multi-cultural Polish-Lithuanian identity.\n\n Coming from an impoverished noble family, Syrokomla suffered tragedy after tragedy in his early life. He had to abandon his studies early due to financial problems, and three of his four children passed away in the same year. In 1844, he published the first of his poems, 'Pocztylion', under the pen name 'Władysław Syrokomla', a name he took from his family's coat of arms. Eventually, he rose to become the editor of the Kurier Wilenski, the largest and most prestigious Polish language in the Vilnius area. However, after taking part in an anti-tsarist demonstration in 1861, he was arrested by the Russian Okhrana and sentenced to house arrest - dying a year later, virtually penniless.\nHeavily influenced by fellow Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, Syrokomla's poems dealt with the liberation of peasants and the dream of a free Polish-Lithuania. While he wrote in Polish, he acknowledged himself as Lithuanian as his birthplace was located in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also wrote several poems in Belarusian due to his fascination with the society and culture of 19th century Belarus. An icon among the Lithuanian literary world, Syrokomla's works illustrate Poles, Lithuanians, and Belarusians."

The little bird will ask God to lend a hand, to help the poor man bear his bitter lot. To have the strength to carry his cross. To make it to the grave without complaint.'\n\nThe words on the state are indeed a solemn memento mori. Syrokomla died young, struggling with his lack of education and his deep poverty. Yet the poet's deep lyrics resonate to an audience more than seventy years later... a testament to his accomplishments."

 LIT.100.t:0 "The Optimal System"
 LIT.100.d:0 "The political views of Stasys Šalkauskis stem from his Christian upbringing and his experience of both 'Western' and 'Eastern' culture. Having studied in Moscow and Friburg alike, he came to view Lithuania as a fusion of 'rational' Western culture and 'emotional' Eastern culture, believing both of these rudiments to be equally important and Lithuania as something unique in the world history. It is a bridge between East and West, a nation which is able to manifest the best features of them both, if only its cultural and political system is reformed to optimally draw out these rudiments and create a truly pluralistic, democratic state.\n\nŠalkauskis has been a maverick in Lithuanian politics for as long as he has participated in them. Though a believer in social justice and a harsh opponent of free market capitalism, he denounced socialism as demagogic and atomistic, and based his beliefs in Christian compassion and solidarity rather than revolutionary thought. He believed his fellow Christian Democrats to be 'inquisitioners', rather than politicians, too. In his eyes, Christian democracy should carefully weigh the balance between individualism and socialism (which he saw as a reaction to individualism, i.e. capitalism) and draw out the benefits of them both - and the way to do so is through federal corporatism.\n\nLike many Christian politicians, Šalkauskis believed in economic corporatism. The entire country needs to be organised into economic, cultural, political and spiritual corporations - and these corporations unite into even greater units, federations. These federations would work autonomously, resolving social issues amongst themselves without the need for extensive government involvement. Politically, these federations would manifest as autonomous Lithuanian, Belarusian, Polish and Jewish entities within a united Kingdom; economically - as federations of trade unions and chambers of commerce; spiritually and culturally - as a universal belief in Christian ethics and compassion, serving as the strings which knit the society together. It should be noted that Šalkauskis did not believe in the imposition of Christianity over Lithuania's non-Christian subjects, such as Jews - in his eyes, Christian ethics, such as those professed in the Decalogue, are universal amongst all humans, even if they carry different names in different religions."

Some overblow the Lithuanian population, some Polish, some Belarusian, and the reason is that because previous censuses in Lithuanian territory were inaccurate, prone to nationalist fact-twisting and uncertainties regarding certain nationalities. A new census is thus planned to take place and settle all debates once and for all.\n\nThe Lithuanian census of [GetYear] can be organised swiftly, allowing the government to quickly move on with the issue and start on other projects in the Optimal System plan, or we can take our time to make sure the data is as accurate as it can possibly be."

Prime Minister Šalkauskis is more passive towards the organisation than his predecessors, seeing it as an example of what an economic corporation envisioned in his works would look like - however, his opposition towards socialism, which Bundas espouses, and dissatisfaction with the Jewish corporation outcompeting other ethnic groups have led to him approving a plan to curtail its influence.\n\nUnder orders of the Christian Democratic government, several state-sponsored trade union federations have been founded, most notably the Lithuanian Christian Labour Federation (Lietuvos krikščioniškoji darbo federacija) and the Central Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Handwork (Centriniai prekybos, pramonės ir amatų rūmai), uniting Lithuanian labourers and business owners respectively.

Though this is different in minority schools, this standard curriculum remains from Palanga to Suwałki. The drive towards federalism forces us to reconsider our approach to language education.\n\nPrime Minister Šalkauskis's dream would be to have each student in the country, Lithuanian, Slavic or other, to learn Lithuanian and one Slavic language of choice, to allow interconnection between the Kingdom's population - but German authorities continue to enforce mandatory German language education for all students, and loading them with three mandatory languages to learn would be horrifying.

It manifests itself in the form of mass protests, vandalism, or even outright assaults against political opponents. Several skirmishes between armed nationalists and police forces have been registered across the country, resulting in dozens wounded and the country shackled by terror.\n\nIt is believed that this violent activism is the work of the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), an underground organisation of Lithuanian nationalists seeking to free Lithuania from any and all foreign influence."

Šalkauskis continued, that though his Christian believes, political views, and way of life may clash with Alter and the Bundas, they have the same end goal, being the betterment of their fellow man. For this, Šalkauskis and is government is willing to overlook certain aspects of the Bundas. Of course, Alter knew there would be a 'but', with Šalkauskis expressing the need for the more radical members of the organisation to be reeled in. Upon completion of his sentence, Alter's cohort began conversing amongst themselves in a mixture of Polish and Yiddish. An argument had broken out between certain members, complete with coarse curses being exchanged, but was then silenced by Alter slamming his fist on the table, and in Lithuanian, telling two of his cohort to leave.

He called for his fellow Poles to resist the Šalkauskis government and its efforts for reform. This speech has been broadcasted through radio across much of Suwałki Region, and it seems that many of those listening to him express support to his atomising ideas.\n\nPerhaps it should be no surprise, given that Kościałkowski is a notable Polish irredentist and has gotten into trouble with the authorities over his anti-Lithuanian remarks before, but it should also be noted that our census has sparked Polish resentment which Kościałkowski simply used to his advantage..."

It has been reported that with each day, the progress of the Optimal System seems fruitful as more and more Lithuanians are identifying as Lithuanian despite their numerous ethnic backgrounds. With the end goal of Lithuania being a nation that expresses both western democratic values and eastern tradition, proponents of the Optimal System have argued that the system will only lead Lithuania forwards.

The philosopher vehemently denies this as an attempt to grant the monarchy stronger executive powers, however, citing that his belief is that the monarch must be an apolitical unifying figure first and foremost. Needless to say, this question in the project has yet to be resolved, and this has led to people like Antanas Maceina interpreting the idea as necessitating vast executive powers, even undemocratic ones.\n\nKing Mindaugas III and the cabinet of ministers have been discussing this dilemma, however, and as the Optimal System project is coming to a close, he is willing to present the results of their compromise in a speech to the nation."

Nonetheless, despite their nationalistic rhetoric and hatred for German monarchs, Smetona's Lithuanian Nationalist Union has agreed to change its stance on the monarchy. In a move unforeseen by observers and the press, the king has decided to meet with the Smetona regarding the future of Lithuania's leadership. There are heated tensions on both sides, especially since Smetona will undoubtedly demand power for himself and his party, and few expect an actual compromise to be made.

The first priority of the Nationalist Union in the economic department is to enact sweeping land reform, requisitioning unused land and setting maximum limits to the amount of land one person might own, and distributing government land to the landless and those who own very little land. Unlike the land reform plans proposed by the Social Democrats, however, Smetona's 'national land reform' has a political bent as well. Priority to distributing government land goes to Lithuanian speaking farmers, while non-Lithuanians such as Poles and Belarusians are not prioritised, and, even if they do receive scraps, this land is usually granted deep in Lithuanian-speaking territory, as an attempt to force more non-Lithuanians to move northwards and start assimilating them.

Most of the detained activists have been let free with no charges, as the judges declared that the accusations directed towards them are not reason enough for any sort of jail time. Several were forced to pay fines or given a few months of arrest for less than savoury articles or actions, while the few Aušrinė leaders who fell at the hands of the government received no mercy.\n\nAll in all, while the results were less than satisfactory, the true meaning of the process soon became clear - it was not a matter of arresting anyone, but rather to instil a message to the opposition of Antanas Smetona and his government.

On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the Lithuanian nationalism which courses through the LTS's veins is deeply tied to anti-semitism. Lithuanian nationalists hate the fact that Jewish entrepreneurs are dominating the market, and even their mere presence is too much to bear for some of the radical of the nationalists. Smetona does not support this blatant antisemitism, but looking at the Lithuanian Jewry, he sees something which he can agree is only a threat - the Jewish Labour Bund.\n\nVictor Alter, the leader of the Lithuanian Bundas, has received a private visit from the Prime Minister, where he explained his point of view on the organisation - in of itself, it is a necessary evil, and there are many things which Lithuanians can learn from the productivity and unity of the Labour Bund - however, to tolerate its existence, there are reforms which he needs to undertake. As a show of force, Smetona's right hand man, Augustinas Voldemaras, rallied the paramilitary of the Nationalist Union, the National Guard 'Geležinis Vilkas', to organise loud mass protests surrounding the headquarters of the Bundas, complete with strike teams of armed junior officers ready to burst in at a moment's notice.

Many of Lithuania's leading nationalist figures, such as Jonas Basanavičius and Vincas Kudirka, hail from this region, and even the Lithuanian language has been standardised according to the 'Zanavykai' dialect in northern Suvalkija. However, throughout the 19th century, Polish influence continued to encroach on the region, and towns that were once a core part of Lithuanian culture, such as Sejny/Seinai, have become bilingual or even Polish-dominant.\n\nSince the formation of the Kingdom of Lithuania, the Suwałki electoral districts have been safe constituencies for the Committee of Poles in Lithuania, as their Lithuanian competitors are divided by ideological grounds and could not field a significant challenge. Polish dominated local assemblies have been imposing education in their language, maintain ties with other Polish communities and thus foster the slow Polonisation of the region. Now that the Committee has been broken apart, however, Antanas Smetona's government sees an opportunity.\n\nIt may be possible to orchestrate the formation of a united Lithuanian electoral list in the Suwałki region, which would take advantage of the disunity among the Polish community and retake control of the local assemblies. If a Lithuanian local government is installed this way, not only will it be able to impose policies more acceptable to us, such as Lithuanian language education, funding for Lithuanian communities, and incentives for colonists from the north - but it will also be more loyal to us, allowing us to erode the autonomy of the region.

However, a much autonomy was kept regardless. One of Antanas Smetona's primary talking points as leader of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union was to put an end to this system and put education in Lithuania solely under the control of the central government.\n\nThe Nationalist Union has lodged a bill in the Seimas which has been simply dubbed as 'Language Reform Law'. The primary goals of the project are to eliminate most of the 'school categories' created by the Leonas Bistras government and put most schools in Lithuania under a unified education program, especially language education. All schools falling under the 'standard' school category would be required to teach Lithuanian and German to all students, and hire native speakers for the former subject - this includes schools in so-called 'Outer Lithuanian' territories, majority Polish and Belarusian regions. The Language Reform Law also includes several other streamlining education reforms unrelated to language.\n\nAnd, of course, it is stapled alongside a bill on the increase of funding for orphanages in the Vilnius region, in order to make sure that any opponent thinks twice about voting against this law and thus making poor children in Vilnius cry.

The Lithuanian culture itself must be purified and unwanted foreign influences within it must be removed - for it was this inability to purify which led to Lithuania becoming a slave to Poland, then to Russia, and finally Germany. It is even more extreme in its nationalist stances than even the most radical leaders of the Nationalist Union - it has no desire to even pay lip service to democracy, its hatred towards any ethnic minorities in Lithuania is unprecedented... however, they cheer for Smetona and his goals of strong leadership nonetheless, seeing it as a step in the right direction.\n\nIn his most recent work, 'Žygiuojanti Lietuva' ('Marching Lithuania'), Alantas hails Smetona's government, yet at the same time declares that it needs radical reforms. His primary talking point is Christianity, which Alantas does not hide his disdain of. Describing it as an unwanted, destructive influence imposed upon Lithuania by foreign powers, he calls for Smetona's government to break up the influence of clericalism, abandon its pretenses of democracy and embrace the ideals of pagan humanism, a return to the metaphysical of our forefathers, and selfless sacrifice to one's country.

Narutowicz sent several personal letters to Smetona, stating that much like in 1918, the future of the Lithuanian state depends on compromise, rather than brutally enforced extreme nationalism. To maintain the stability of the country, he should listen to the concerns of the opposition and dial down his efforts, and recognise that Poles and Jews are as much Lithuanians as the Lithuanians themselves."

After the incident, Żeligowski authorised his men to use lethal force, should 'bandits' try to disarm or in any way resist them, who still stand as government's loyal troops and not shady paramilitaries.

 LIT.200.d:0 "As much as the Social Democrats may want to claim that they have arrived here to reform Lithuanian society from its very foundations, this will be a task easier said than done. The election of 1937 has left the LSDP commanding a loose and fragile coalition of democratic socialists, Santara's secular liberals, the near-Syndicalist Jewish Labour Bund, and the Polish minority. The Social Democrats themselves are not united in their direction. The old guard of the party, Kairys included, have moderated severely during the postwar years - but not everyone followed this trend. A strong radical socialist faction, led by Vincas Galinis, Justas Paleckis, and others remains. During the 1920s, the LSDP absorbed the Popular Peasants Union led by Mykolas Sleževičius, integrating a moderate, mildly social liberal faction into their caucus. And this caucus is close to a breaking point.\n\nThe mere mention of Kairys's sweeping reforms are agitating Syndicalist sympathy within the Party. Already, the LSDP is seen as a less than trustworthy force and few believe that it has truly abandoned republicanism. Whether the Prime Minister will seek to destroy this radical influence, or subjugate it and ride the wave forward, will unfold in the years to come."

 LIT.201.t:0 "National Personal Autonomy"
 LIT.201.d:0 "Immediately upon the results of the election of 1937, Steponas Kairys, the new Prime Minister of Lithuania and head of the Social Democratic Party, muttered the immortal words - 'Now we have work to do for a long time'. His opponents immediately took this as a prediction that Kairys will try to stay in power as long as his health allows it - in truth, however, what he was referring to was the structural reforms which he and his party hoped to undertake.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party of Lithuania professes the ideal of National Personal Autonomy. First formulated by Otto Bauer in 1907, it remains the prevailing ethnic policy of the Austromarxist movement, which the LSDP borrows most of its ideas from - what it seeks to achieve is to turn the nation not into a territorial and ethnic entity, but instead a simple association of persons, disjoining the state from its territory. After all, what says that, to be a Lithuanian, you need to live specifically in this plot in Europe and follow a specific set of traditions? As long as you believe yourself to be Lithuanian, hold Lithuanian citizenship, and contribute to the nation, either through taxes or through other ways, what stops you from being considered Lithuanian?\n\nA similar view was espoused by many Bundist Jewish ideologists and thus turned the Social Democrats and the Bundas into natural allies. During their term, the government of Prime Minister Steponas Kairys will seek to undertake significant reforms to achieve their ideal of National Personal Autonomy. Each ethnic group in Lithuania will have their own universal cultural assemblies, with the ability to levy their own taxes and autonomously decide on matters pertaining to their members. Every citizen of the Kingdom would belong to one of these cultural assemblies, but the question of which national movement to join would be a matter of personal choice, and no authority would have any control over his decision.\n\nOf course, these reforms will coincide with LSDP's other policy programs, such as a swift establishment of a welfare system and taking out the right-wing opposition, mostly through legal methods."

 LIT.202.d:0 "The Lithuanian priesthood has traditionally been a very important lobby in Lithuanian economics. There is no shortage of priests and bishops who move from their spiritual duties into the Seimas, plenty have historically been influential ministers or even occupied the Prime Minister seat. Almost universally, the priesthood is loyal followers of the Christian Democratic Party, and use their influence to not only push through policy beneficial towards them, such as state funding for the Church, but also do not hide their stances during sermons and mass. During the most recent electoral campaign, there has been no shortage of cases when fiery priests called that any soul which casts their vote for the Social Democrats will go straight to Hell - and not only is this an annoyance, but also a serious violation of democratic ideals.\n\nThe entire Popular Front coalition agrees that the influence of the Lithuanian priesthood should be curtailed, but disagree on how far these measures should go. The moderate members of the cabinet believe that soft measures such as rescinding state funding for the Catholic Church and strictly enforcing political neutrality should cut it, especially since much of the countryside is still deeply religious and would not take a state conflict with the Church well. The democratic socialist lobby is dissatisfied, however - nothing less than full secularisation will satisfy them. Through a ban on religious education, state control of seminaries and reformed education programs, they believe that the back of the Catholic Church can be broken for good."

The Army has traditionally been a profession of the right wing, their clubs such as the Vilnius Ramovė (Vilnius Officers' Club) openly declare socialism to be a hydra that needed to be fought. Though Prime Minister Steponas Kairys voted in favour of the incumbent Chief of Staff, Stasys Raštikis, back in 1935, believing him to be a politically neutral choice, he has denounced the general's reform project as a waste of money during the campaign trail, instead declaring that these funds should be put into social programs. It is time to act upon these campaign promises.\n\nThe idea of cutting military funding is especially popular among the radical wing of the LSDP, whose rupors Vincas Galinis and Justas Paleckis claim that the army serves as nothing more than a hurdle to the inevitable march of socialism. Is it really worth it to poke the sleeping bear of the Armed Forces, however? The moderate lobby disagrees, their claim is that the funding for social programs can be procured in safer ways, ones which do not turn the army completely against the government."

The latter strongly opposed the former's proposal of implementing unprecedented pro-labour reforms, such as establishing a national labour relations board and implementing state funding for trade unions. Sidzikauskas' claim is that with each proposal as radical as this one, Lithuania veers closer and closer to Syndicalism. Already, Santara has accepted concessions such as a minimum wage, generous pensions and work safety regulations, but it cannot accept radical policy of this unprecedented scale.\n\nIt falls to Prime Minister Steponas Kairys and his cabinet to figure out their response to this conflict within the coalition."

Originally founded in 1910, it was by far the most left wing of all Lithuanian nationalist societies in the last years of the Tsarist period. Even before the Weltkrieg, it translated the works of Benoît Malon and Pyotr Kropotkin and declared itself to be 'individualist socialist', idealising a society of free communes, liberty and religious freedom. In 1923, after several issues where it openly advocated in favour of the French Communard system, 'Aušrinė' was banned and the society of students which organised around it moved underground, where they continued issuing periodicals and radicalise further.\n\nThough a movement of poets and intellectuals at its core, the 'Aušrininkai' have occasionally participated in acts of terror, such as bombings, assassination attempts and clashes with the police, swiftly turning into a boogeyman for the Lithuanian right. It is also no secret that many members of the Social Democrats Party are acquainted with the movement, either by attending their secret meetings or reading their banned literature - thus it is unsurprising that one of their goals is to lift this ban and put an end to years of Aušrininkai terrorism.

Officially a non-aligned organisation dedicated to the study of French culture, art and literature after the Revolution of 1919, it is believed to be a method for the spread of Internationale influence in Lithuanian left-wing circles. With the LSDP seemingly turning towards radicalism, the Lithuanian secret services, in cooperation with their German peers, have finally chosen to act. Through secret channels, they have recruited Vytautas Mačernis to investigate the Group and collect information on the future plans of the Party.

One thing which all of them agreed upon, however, was that German and bourgeois domination in Lithuania will not last.

Every single Lithuanian must be trained to wield a weapon and know his place in the armed nation. Such a nation will be completely unassailable and impossible to destroy."

While we have long questioned how and where they are getting their supplies and weapons, our intelligence has indicated that it appears that Russia is supplying them. While our intelligence has revealed that the LAF is not strong enough to topple our regime through a civil war, it is evident that the LAF is content with simply hampering the government and its reforms. Their propaganda can be found in towns all around Lithuania with leaflets describing the severe faults and failings of the ruling administration. If they have genuinely chosen violence to convey their message, then we may have to return with just as much violence to end their insurrection once and forever."

The bomb severely damaged the factory while also scarring the local infrastructure. The attack has been claimed by none other than the LAF, who claim that the purpose of the attack was to strike at German businesses in Lithuania. While the local firemen and police officers' response is admirable, many locals are highly unnerved, with some even blaming the Lithuanian government for inaction. There are even growing murmurs that the government's actions in recent days have done nothing but provoke the LAF into orchestrating more terror attacks. If we are to regain the trust of our people, then we must double down on our efforts to show the people that we can protect them!"

While reports on the ground indicate no deaths, there are still plenty of workers wounded. The attack has been claimed by none other than the LAF, who have declared that their attack aimed to disrupt Germany's hold in our nation. While rebuilding our damaged industry will take time, our citizens grow weary of the violence each day.

While hardliners are pushing for the military to seek out the LAF actively, a search of the LAF would be akin to finding a needle in a haystack without any intelligence of their whereabouts. Unfortunately, it appears that we must wait for them to make the first move before we crush them once and for all..."

 LIT.254.t:0 "Failed Attack"
 LIT.254.d:0 "The military command in Vilnius was utterly ecstatic today when news of an actual victory reached them. It appears in their vain arrogance, the dogs of the LAF attempted to raid a small military outpost near Kaunas in broad daylight. They most likely intended to raid the base purely for supplies since they have been on the run and are probably running out of fuel for their so-called insurrection. Striking the base foolishly, the defenders fired from fortified sandbag positions and towers, picking off the LAF forces like fish in a barrel. Finally, after substantial casualties, the LAF fled for the woods once more but not before leaving behind their wounded and fallen comrades. News of the victory has reached the streets of all Lithuanian towns, with the military and government praised for the response. Finally, we have achieved great success, a testament to our government's strength and our military's loyalty to Lithuania!"

 LIT.255.t:0 "Railway Bombing"
 LIT.255.d:0 "Residents along the Kaunas-Virbalis railway awoke to a loud explosion and a cloud of smoke in the middle of the night. It would appear that in the dead of night, the LAF terrorists struck quickly and vanished just as fast into the Lithuanian forests. The implication of their attack is clear; the rail lines in Lithuania are pivotal to the supply and transportation of the Reichspakt, and without them, troops around the Reichspakt's eastern borders would have their food and ammunition hindered. While we will send reconstruction crews to get our trains up and running once more quickly, the latest attack reflects the increasingly violent nature of the LAF. We will make sure that when we find them, they will pay for their crimes."

 LIT.256.t:0 "Military Depot Raided"
 LIT.256.d:0 "A military depot in Suwałki, close to the Polish-Lithuanian border, found itself under attack in the dead of night. With the sudden firing of a flare as a signal, the LAF forces converged upon the outpost, targeting whoever and whatever they could, while also picking off panicked deserters from the trees. Most of whom initially panicked, the loyalist defenders began a courageous defence using the depot's light machine guns to suppress the enemy. However, the LAF insurgents had vanished deep into the Knyszyn Forest despite their valiant attempts, and the defenders were too exhausted to pursue them. By the time the sun finally rose, reinforcements in the military had finished putting out the last of the fires. The damage to the city's industrial hub is assessed to be light and moderate, but the lives lost were irreplaceable."

 LIT.257.t:0 "Battle in the Streets"
 LIT.257.d:0 "In an utterly brazen attack that was undoubtedly motivated by racial hatred, the town of Pabradė found itself under attack by LAF forces in broad daylight. In a chaotic rampage, the LAF set upon the centre of the city, causing havoc and destruction everywhere they went. The city's Jewish population, nearly making up one-third of population, fled from the town in abject fear. However, the cry for help did not fall onto deaf ears, and the alarm reached a local garrison of Lithuanian military that arrived in the town at once. After an intense firefight on the city streets and the LAF fled, but the damage had been done. Houses, shops, and businesses were targeted in the orgy of violence, and although the military has restored order, the incident has most certainly unnerved many Lithuanians. As evident from this attack in the day, it is clear that the LAF is getting stronger day by day, and the question on everyone's minds is - when will they return."

 LIT.258.t:0 "Army Remains Neutral"
 LIT.258.d:0 "As civil strife rears its ugly head in the Kingdom, the Royal Lithuanian Defence Forces have been witnessing more and more divide. It's undeniable that there are sympathies for Voldemaras present among the officer corps, especially among the more radical young guard. The Chief of Staff of the armed forces, Stasys Raštikis, however, has tried to navigate the delictae issue by keeping the LAF sympathisers in the sidelines without outright forbiding them command. For now, the army is on the side of the lawful government, but the creeping doubt still lingers."

 LIT.259.t:0 "Minorities Harassed"
 LIT.259.d:0 "Reports are coming in from the southern provinces, informing about horrifying acts committed by members of the Activist Front. To nail down and enforce the message that they stand for a 'Lithuania for Lithuanians', these nationalists have been harassing and attacking Polish, Belarusian and Jewish minorities, driving them out of their homes in the cities and assaulting known notable leaders of those ethnic groups. More often than not, this violence has been responded to by violence - the Jewish Labour Bund has started to organise self-defence squads to protect their members, so have the Poles in Suwałki, and they have been getting into shootouts with 'Wolves', as the LAF paramilitaries have been dubbed."

 LIT.260.t:0 "Lithuania in Flames"
 LIT.260.d:0 "Violence. Every day, the newspaper headlines scream nothing but the violence committed by the LAF. In the streets of northern Lithuania, the pavements run red with blood. The wolves of Voldemaras have been roaming the streets searching for prey, their victims often being Poles. Their violence has even escalated to the point where priests are becoming victims; a Polish priest gravely wounded after being beaten badly by members of the LAF. The Catholic organisation Ateitis grows militant by the day, angered by the military's inaction and protective of their priests. There are even rumours and murmurs that members of the LŠS are also supporters of Voldemaras - a grave indication that perhaps the LAF's support base is more extensive than what is on paper. An old Polish general, Żeligowski, has been vocal in his demands for the government to take bolder action, or the Poles will organise and start defending themselves."

 LIT.261.d:0 "Two days ago, a radio station of Kauno Radiofonas, suddenly went under and its broadcasts ceased. Police were called to the headquarters of the building immediately, called by concerned citizens, but they found only an empty building and all of its equipment mysteriously vanished. Before the story could even be publicised by national newspapers and the mystery brought to the limelight, it solved itself - Kauno Radiofonas started broadcasting messages yet again. The message was clear - it was a speech of hatred towards the Poles, the Jews, the Germans and all other 'parasites' corrupting the Lithuanian nation. We have tried to hunt down the terrorist radio with poor results, but they cannot keep broadcasting their propaganda forever."

After a lengthy search, all information regarding the party has been collated disseminated to several members of the government, the army and to Šalkauskis himself.\n\nTo Šalkauskis' shock, it appears one of his closest friends, Antanas Maceina, has been implicated with the LAF terrorists and appears members of his Naujoji Romuva have been assisting or out right participating in LAF terror attacks. To complicate thing further, members of the Ateitis, a Christian youth organisation with close ties to Šalkauskis, has been compromised by the LAF, with it already conducting some in house cleaning. Several members being removed from the organisation, though it appears corruption and immoralism of the LAF's influence runs deeper then anyone could of thought."

 LIT.263.d:0 "After surrendering himself to the local authorities, Antanas Maceina has been hastily escorted to a prison cell within Vilnius. To learn more about the LAF's leadership, movements, and locations, Maceina has been interrogated brutally by the Lithuanian Army. Despite Maceina's resistance, it appears that the harsh methods of the Lithuanian military bore fruit, as Maceina has finally broken down. He revealed that ever since his capture, his followers have now flocked to Voldemaras with what appears to be internal unrest among the leadership of the LAF. He has also revealed critical movements and hideouts of the LAF and has even exposed the location of Vytautas Atlanta, his rival. Nonetheless, this has been a vital victory in the fight against the LAF has their leadership seems to be increasingly fragile. With their movements revealed, the military can finally go on the move. Maceina has pleaded for amnesty, arguing that he never believed the LAF would resort to violence and that he had been one of the most vocal inside the LAF against terrorism. Whether or not he is genuine will be up to the jury, but he will sit in his cold cell reflecting on his actions and decisions that have brought him here."

 LIT.264.t:0 "The Capture of Alantas"
 LIT.264.d:0 "The net has been tightening around Vytautas Alantas for quite some time now, and finally we have good idea of his base of operations. A group of handpicked elite soldiers was sent to capture Alantas, either dead or alive, and found the supposed location to be a little homestead in a quiet part of the country. Storming the hamlet, they found Alantas in his home, but the celebration was cut short when Alantas informed the soldiers that he had effectively fallen out with Voldemaras. The party found themselves soon under attack by a small group of Voldemarininkai who their leader had sent to take out Alantas. The Voldemarininkai were no match for the disciplined and veteran volunteers and soon routed. Alantas, highly fearful of his life, willingly surrendered to the Lithuanian Army and declared that he would cooperate and reveal anything the Lithuanian Army needed."

 LIT.265.t:0 "An Iron Cage for an Iron Wolf"
 LIT.265.d:0 "The LAF leadership had been effectively dismantled, and its members lay primarily scattered in the wind. The information revealed from Maceina and Alantas revealed that the LAF had become frail due to internal conflicts in leadership that threatened to take the party apart. Even though Voldemaras was now the de facto leader of the LAF and stood unopposed, his central location deep in the Lithuanian forest had been revealed, and his forces were becoming increasingly thin and worn out. Reports from intelligence indicate that with Voldemaras' circle becoming progressively smaller, he was currently at his most vulnerable. With the approval of Šalkauskis, the military has planned out an operation of handpicked volunteers who had no connections to the LAF. Finally, the time had come to rid Lithuania of this terrible nightmare and end the vile threat of the LAF once and for all."

After quietly taking out the guards on patrol around the compound, the volunteers violently stormed open the building with automatic weapons, and the rattle of gunfire echoes throughout the forest, breaking the silence of the night. The LAF forces guarding Voldemaras fought back furiously to the bitter end, but many of them were wiped out, with those wounded immediately surrendering themselves to the Army. Finally, the firing stops, and the volunteers search the corpses for Voldemaras amidst the carnage and destruction of the skirmish. He is found dead, a bullet to the head, and while it is unclear whether or not he was shot in the firefight or took his own life, one thing is sure - the Iron Wolf of Lithuania has fallen."

Once again the news report of civilians caught in the crossfire or in LAF's bombing attack against the military.

Some of the government's loyalists were disarmed after a brief firefight, while many others are still offering resistance from their holdouts across the city. In the chaos of the coup, bands of Voldemaras' men have started indiscriminate violence against all perceived traitors.

Especially Maceina's 'Crypto-Bolsheviks' have drawn the ire of Voldemaras' Wolves, going as far to open skirmishes during the Battle of Vilnius. Alantas' group, being smaller than the Wolves but having perhaps even more radical thought, has been wary of Voldemaras' intentions of taking control of the national renewal, with fears that he will use his advantage to crush his so-called 'allies' before they can move on him - like any of the three would, if they could.\n\nUnder this backdrop of paranoia, the secret meeting between Alantas and Maceina has taken place in one of their hideouts in the outskirts of Vilnius: and the subject of the meeting is no other than high treason.

The loss of the man who turned the group of activists into true, national revolution, is tremendous to the spirit of his followers, who have started debate to find a worthy successor for the Iron Wolf. Despite cries to find leader among themselves, even the idealists have to admit that two other men left of the LAF leadership, Vytautas Alantas and Antanas Maceina, are perhaps the only two people who can lead the existential battle.\n\nThe debate is bitter - Maceina believes in the eventual destruction of the bourgeoisie, the strength and renewal of the Lithuanian worker, and the end to social and economic injustice. To Maceina, capitalism is the very reason for Lithuania's moral and economic decay, and only through the Church and Lithuanian culture will Lithuania find its path once more. On the other hand, Alantas believes that Lithuania must return to its folk origins, to the days of the ancestors' gods and that the church is nothing more than foreign interference in the history and culture of Lithuania. Alantas believes that society must be heavily militarised, but his stance on economics is far more liberal than the radical distribution of wealth advocated by Maceina. Both men agree that Lithuanian society must be one for and run by Lithuanians only - but it seems that it's rapidly becoming the only thing they agree on.\n\nAfter hours of speeches and politicking, Alantas has finally snapped and denounced Maceina as nothing more than a socialist agent, turncloak who arranged the assassination of Voldemaras. Maceina's answer was equally harsh, describing Alantas as nothing more than a man with dictatorial ambitions who plans to destroy the Church in Lithuania.

There was never any doubt of the verdict - the jury picked by Voldemaras has declared Maceina and his organisation enemies of the state, sentenced to death by firing squad. After the gunshots sent one of the three to meet his dear Maker, Voldemaras turns to his remaining co-ruler, Alantas, whose involvement in the conspiracy is still seem shady by many. Voldemaras gives him simple choice - to recognise Voldemaras as the sole and sovereign ruler of Lithuania like any loyal follower should, or face trial for his part in so-called Maceina Affair.

 LIT.330.d:0 "In the LAF's campaign against all groups they deem traitors to Lithuania, few have received as much ire as the Jewish population. With most LAF members subscribing to rabidly anti-Semetic views, cells have taken to destroying Jewish businesses and committing horrible acts of violence in Jewish quarters across the nation. These attacks have become more frequent and more daring in recent days, as our critically-stretched police force struggles to prevent attacks even in towns and cities where Jews are the largest ethnic group.\n\nOur inability to protect the Jewish population has left the Jewish Labour Bund deeply furious - as a precondition for their support of Narutowicz's government, Victor Alter and the rest of the Bundas leadership has demanded that something be done to address the terror against Lithuania's Jews. Narutowicz has agreed that the current situation cannot stand, and has spent a long night attempting to reach an agreement on a solution. The most obvious and direct answer to the problem is to further expand the nation's constabularies, hopefully providing them with the shot in the arm needed to hamstring the LAF's ability to target Jewish communities. However, some radical Bundas members aren't content with this solution - they complain that the constabularies, even with extra support, are in practice only able to react with various amounts of delay to LAF attacks, and in some cases may be prone to anti-Semetic thinking themselves. Their alternative proposal is to allow Jewish communities to form their own police forces, which they argue will be more responsive and effective at keeping thse communities safe.\n\nThis counteroffer is highly controversial for several reasons - not least because it places these Jewish police units as a parallel entity to the government and largely outside its control, and may be interpreted as a concession on the part of the government that it can't protect all of its citizens, regardless of how true that may or may not be. However, while much of the police insists that the extra resources will be enough to get a handle on LAF activity, some admit that structural inefficiencies are limiting their effectiveness and that throwing more money at the problem will only go so far. Either way, the support of the Bundas is crucial - and so, a decision must be made."

He went on to state though this may be his views, he also cannot tolerate the LAF and their "unholy" views they hold and in short sees them as the greater devil. Smetona proposed that with his contacts in the LAF, he can persuade several important members and their men to leave the LAF with the condition of amnesty given.\n\nNarutowicz firstly scoffed at this notion, stating Smetona has no real power here, and furthermore, what guarantees could he offer Narutowicz that he like the LAF, won't attempt to lead a coup against his government. Smetona grinned and as if by command, several members of the LAF forces entered the room, with Plechavičius drawing his concealed sabre, staring right at Smetona with a look of betrayal on his face. Smetona raised his hand at Plechavičius and stated, “These men have wished to surrender themselves to you Narutowicz, though of course I promised them amnesty and I hope you will allow me to hold my word to these men and others that will follow". Upon hearing this, Plechavičius broke out into a laugh, sheathing his sabre and slapped Narutowicz on the back, stating Smetona, the old fox still has it. Smetona stated his only one request for assisting Narutowicz is that he be allowed to reform the LTS and be allowed back into the Seimas.

He believed rational science, metaphysics and Christian ideology to all stem from the same source, the divine Logos, and thus a good Christian should seek a unity of theological, philosophical and scientific knowledge. This drive for unity should reflect itself in society - Jakštas advocated for amending the Schism and restoring a single, universal Christian church, he believed that class warfare should be replaced by class cooperation, driven by Christian ethics, and he was the first in Lithuania to introduce the idea of the United States of Europe, which his home country Lithuania should champion and join. He was an internationalist - he believed that 'open-minded and open-hearted people' who would support these ideas exist in every country, repressed by the ignorance of the masses, and should they join a single worldwide organisation, they would be able to guide the world towards the absolute Truth and absolute Good.\n\nPerhaps because of this reason, Jakštas has had a deep interest in Esperanto ever since its creation, and chaired the Esperanto Federation of Lithuania until his death, believing it to be an important step towards his internationalist ideals."

Since then, it has been an important mass movement and pressure group in Lithuanian politics, uniting over sixty thousand members as well as maintaining close alliances with other Lithuanian religious organisations.

During his forty years of life, Kudirka accomplished much in the name of the Lithuanian nation, most notably writing the hymn 'Tautiška giesmė', which has since become the national anthem of Lithuania. Unlike his fellow patriarch of the National Revival, Jonas Basanavičius, Vincas Kudirka had a much more defined political program. He believed that patriotism alone would not be able to revive the Lithuanian nation, thus it was the duty of their generation to educate the Lithuanian peasantry, improve their lives and fight in the name of social justice. Though he passed away in 1899, before the independence of Lithuania could be established, his thought has had a profound impact on Lithuania since. It is said that Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas, a famous leader of Lithuanian radical socialists, chose his alias in honour of Kudirka - Kudirka's pen name was 'Kapsas', while Mickevičius was only 'Kapsukas', meaning 'little Kapsas'. On the other side of the political spectrum, right-wing Lithuanian nationalists also claim his memory for themselves, they note his stance against Polonisation and nationalist outlook.\n\nIn honour of this anniversary, a statue for Vincas Kudirka, designed by the sculptor Vincas Grybas, is planned to be erected in Vilnius. At the same time, we are able to push through our own version on Kudirka. By downplaying some facts about his life and exalting others, we can shape historical memory into a political weapon. What should future generations remember him as?"
 LITFLA.8.a:0 "A champion of the ethnic Lithuanian nationalist cause!"
 LITFLA.8.b:0 "A true progressive, the founding father of social democracy."
 LITFLA.8.c:0 "Was he not the man whom even Syndicalists admire?"

 LITFLA.9.t:0 "The Memory of the January Uprising"
 LITFLA.9.d:0 "1938 marks the one hundred and ten year anniversary of the birth of Antanas Mackevičius, a Lithuanian priest and one of the leaders of the Lithuanian rebels in the January Uprising of 1863. Though traditionally seen as a Polish uprising against Tsarist rule, it gained significant traction in Lithuania as well, where it coincided with peasant unrest over an unsatisfactory abolition of serfdom. It is considered to be a turning point in Lithuanian history - while the uprising in Lithuania still hoped to join Poland in a federation, the Lithuanian National Revival which sparked in the years after finally disjoined Lithuanian national identity from that of Poland, and turned these nations from comrades into enemies. Antanas Mackevičius and other Lithuanian members of the January Uprising, while still supporters of a Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, had a far more concise national identity than their brethren in the decades beforehand. At the same time, the uprising fought for social justice, the rights of the peasantry, and other radical ideas, which has made it an inspiration for the Lithuanian socialist movement in the years after.\n\nIn an independent Lithuania, the November and January Uprisings are most commemorated by Polish Lithuanians, as a means of expressing the centuries long connection between the Polish and Lithuanian nations. Now, they seek to fund a memorial in Krekenava, which, alongside Mackevičius, would also commemorate other leaders of the uprising in Lithuania, such as Zigmantas Sierakauskas and Konstantinas Kalinauskas. We are able to turn this memorial into a political message. What should future generations remember about the January Uprising?"
 LITFLA.9.a:0 "Prevent the memorial from being raised, it honours Polonised traitors."
 LITFLA.9.b:0 "Let us not forget that Mackevičius was a devout Catholic."
 LITFLA.9.c:0 "Mackevičius was the first Lithuanian revolutionary socialist!"

 LITFLA.10.t:0 "The Memory of the Constitution of May 3rd"
 LITFLA.10.d:0 "May 3rd, the date when the Constitution of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was signed and declared in 1791, is one of the most important dates in Polish history - and ever since the foundation of an independent Lithuania, there has been pressure from the Polish Lithuanian community to list it as a commemorated day here as well. It was the first Constitution published in the Old World, and while it only lasted in effect for less than a year, it has had a profound impact on the political thought in the region, being the culmination of Enlightenment thought in Poland-Lithuania. However, while it is unquestionably important in Polish historical memory, it does not hold the same respect among Lithuanians. After all, it was the same Constitution that sought to abolish the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and establish the unitary Kingdom of Poland in its wake - and while this was prevented with the Reciprocal Guarantee of the Two Nations a few months after, it does not change the fact that this Constitution is seen as something 'foreign', rather than something 'Lithuanian' as much as it is 'Polish'.\n\nRegardless, the pressure to recognise May 3rd as a commemorated date remains. Should we cave in to the pressure, or maintain the line of thought that this is not a date Lithuania should commemorate?"
 LITFLA.10.a:0 "This date is a memory of a beautiful union once lost..."
 LITFLA.10.b:0 "It is an event memorable for Poles. Not Lithuanians."

 LITFLA.11.d:0 "Our general, Silvestras Žukauskas, has recently passed away at the age of 76. Having previously served in a cavalry unit in the army of the Russian Empire, he quickly rose through the ranks during the Russo-Japanese war before eventually becoming a Major-General in 1916 due to his service in the Weltkrieg. Following the treaty of Brest-Litowsk, Silvestras Žukauskas has since then served the newly formed independent nation of Lithuania."

The glorification of Lithuanian heroes and grand dukes in the treatise have led to it being picked up by Lithuanian nationalists as their unofficial Bible."

 LITFLA.13.t:0 "The National Lithuanian Olympiad"
 LITFLA.13.d:0 "With patriotism rising across our country, the idea has been suggested to organise a national olympiad of various sporting events where Lithuanian sportsmen and sportswomen, both from the Kingdom and from abroad, would be able to test their skills and compete in preparation for representing their country worldwide. This would be the so-called National Olympiad ('Tautinė Olimpiada'). The National Olympiad would be opened with a prestigious ceremony this July and all of the participants would swear an oath to represent their nation in international sporting events with all of their might, dedicate themselves to the nation and respect its history, culture and traditions. This would be a fantastic event to rouse up support for our government and calm the nation down. The funds for this will come out of the budget."

 LITFLA.14.t:0 "The Cult of Vytautas the Great"
 LITFLA.14.d:0 "Vytautas the Great, one of the most famous Lithuanian monarchs from the 15th century, has always been a symbol of the Lithuanian fight for independence. He was anti-German and anti-Polish, he promoted Christianity yet was tolerant towards other faiths and cultures, he was a staunch abstinent from alcohol, he was a great military tactician - thus, he appeals to pretty much everyone in Lithuanian society. Already, there are annual celebrations during his death date five hundred years ago, October 27th, and the day when he should have been crowned as the King of Lithuania before his death, August 8th. An idea has been raised to promote this into a cult of the long deceased Grand Duke, tying his image with the image of the government and thus using this cult of personality to strengthen the legitimacy of our government."

A cultural icon in his home country, responsible for popularising foreign travel and interest in geography, his death has been met with shock and surprise from the Lithuanian people.

 LITFLA.17.t:0 "To an Organic Lithuanian State"
 LITFLA.17.d:0 "Far from all Lithuanian Catholics are aligned with the Christian Democratic Party, its stated goals and vision, or even its support for democracy. A growing new generation of religious activists and intellectuals concentrated in movements such as the Catholic youth journal 'Naujoji Romuva', having forgotten the long struggle of the Lithuanian nation before the Weltkrieg, see it for what it is - a state shackled by petty politicking, German domination, and social injustice. The ideals of this movement are most expressed in the works and activities of Antanas Maceina, culminating in him and many of his peers publishing the manifesto of the Young Catholic movement, 'Į organišką valstybę' ('To an Organic State')\n\nThe primary enemy of the Young Catholic movement is social and economic injustice, spurred by Distributist influence, and in their manifesto, Maceina calls for radical land reform, redistribution of wealth and the uprooting of 'bourgeois-liberal thought' from the Lithuanian identity. Even the Catholic Church would not be safe from redistribution - after all, one can worship Christ without gold and silk, so why should the Church hold onto its wealth when there is so much suffering they could alleviate? In place of capitalism, they push forward a society of economic democracy and Christian corporatism. However, they challenge Syndicalists and social democrats alike by declaring that only an ethnically pure society can be socially and economically just. To them, Lithuania can only be Lithuanian, and a Lithuanian must live and die immersed in national and Catholic culture. While the Naujoji Romuva nominally believe in democracy, they also express that 'temporary' strong hand leadership is necessary and even mandatory to achieve all of their radical reforms.\n\nThe Young Catholic movement sits with the Lithuanian Activist Front, occupying a left-wing, Christian national distributist niche."

 LITFLA.18.t:0 "The Vairas Steers Right"
 LITFLA.18.d:0 "While all in the LAF seek to free Lithuania from foreign influence, others raise the question of how its subjugation happened in the first place and how to avoid it a second time. This movement, the most right wing faction of the LAF, is known as the Vairas ('the Wheel'), named after the nationalist journal their followers took over in the 1930s, and their leader is the writer and ideologue Vytautas Alantas.\n\nAlantas declares that it is not enough for Lithuania to break free from German domination - the goal of the LAF should be to form a truly 'national ideology', to liberate Lithuanians spiritually, culturally as well as physically, for as long as they think like slaves and see themselves as slaves, they will remain slaves. In his eyes, the first National Revival was a failure, as it failed to form a truly free Lithuanian state, so the Vairas should be the flag-bearers of a second one, one which will last forever. It disdains Christianity, believing it to be a foreign influence imposed upon Lithuanians, and instead looks towards pagan traditions, which, in Alantas's eyes, are the truest expression of Lithuanian national identity - it idealises a dream where the Lithuanian nation is subservient to a truly nationalist society under a single unquestioned leader, the Vadas, whose citizens are willing to give their life for the Nation, which worships traditions of time immemorial instead of 'the psychosis of democracy'. Despite their totalitarian intentions, it maintains liberal economic intentions, its leaders such as Domas Cesevičius expressing that a Lithuanian National Revival must create a society where every Lithuanian can achieve wellbeing through his own effort and individual innovation.\n\nThe Vairas movement sits with the Lithuanian Activist Front, occupying a far-right wing, totalitarian nationalist niche."

 LITFLA.20.d:0 "Ignas Šeinius, Lithuania's most famous impressionist writer, has recently published a new book, 'Raudonasis tvanas' (The Red Flood) that has just breached Lithuania's prison in literary obscurity.\n\nMuch like his famous 'Kuprelis', The Red Flood is a gripping impressionist tale about a love story between two young individuals in a divided country, but what is must interesting is the setting of the story. The novel takes place in an alternate timeline where the Brusilov Offensive was successful and knocked Austria-Hungary out of the Weltkrieg in 1916. This leads to a chain of events that result in an Entente victory. Germany is engulfed by revolution and becomes a Syndicalist nation, while Russia experiences a coup led by Kolchak, supported by the Black Hundreds, and becomes a totalitarian ultra-nationalist dictatorship. Europe is soon embroiled in war once more, and Lithuania becomes a front line, a bloodbath between the Germans and Russians, where even the strongest men perish and die in minutes. The end of the novel hints at a possible Russian breakthrough, as well as a naval invasion by the still-extant British Empire...\n\nThe book has been criticised for horrid descriptions of cruelty and war crimes, but Šeinius defends his tale, saying that 'something like this could have happened in another Universe'."

Despite loving his homeland, Vyacheslav was forced to emigrate, leave the nation and settle in Dvinsk. Yet another fleeing soul.\n\nWhile some people like Vyacheslav protested the new government with their feet, others are taking a far more active stance.

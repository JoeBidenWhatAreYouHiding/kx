Not long after inception, it took a straight dive towards socialism, influence by Benoît Malon and Peter Kropotkin, and, ultimately, revolutionary syndicalism. It was forced out of schools and universities and ultimately banned by executive order in 1923, but continued spreading its ideas through the underground. Using dummy organisations to cover up their activities and publishing their magazine through ever changing names and titles, and sometimes taking up in left-wing terrorism, they remain a headache for any Lithuanian government. Aušrinė stands out among worldwide Syndicalist organisations by being a 'writers' party' - the absolute majority of their members are intellectuals, poets and writers, as such it is a lively community and their ideology is untainted, but they command little popular support.§!"

The radical wing of the LSDP calls for no compromise with Lithuania's status as a monarchy, nor its domination by Germans, and instead looks towards France and other Syndicalist states as its potential saviours. Despite these radical stances, they maintain a constant presence in the party and hold significant influence over its leadership as well as ordinary membership.§!"
 
 LIT_social_democrat_party:0 "LSDP"
 LIT_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Lietuvos socialdemokratų partija                          §gThe Social Democratic Party of Lithuania is the largest party of the Lithuanian left wing and proudly calls itself the oldest political party in Lithuania. Its history stretches to 1896, although it only became a Lithuanian party foremost in 1902. Although the LSDP commanded great influence over the Lithuanian independence movement, it was forced out of the Council of Lithuania due to its republican stances, an act which many hold grudges for ever since. In the independent Kingdom of Lithuania, they have moderated their anti-monarchist position, but its condition as an anti-German, anti-capitalist party has allowed it to become a big tent movement for the Lithuanian left wing. The core of the party is influenced by the German SPD and Austromarxism, and while it remains a democratic party at heart, it does not disdain socialist or outright Syndicalist influence. This Petri dish of left-wing ideas collected to one organisation makes it rather difficult to achieve a consensus, however.§!"

 LIT_social_liberal_party:0 "KPL/LLK"
 LIT_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Lietuvos lenkų komitetas/Komitet Polaków na Litwie §gThe Committee of Lithuanian Poles is the largest of many ethnic minority parties in the Kingdom of Lithuania, originally founded in 1920 to contest the first democratic elections in the country. It is a party that unites Lithuanian Polish interests and campaigns for issues that matter to them first and foremost, such as cultural and political autonomy, funding of Polish language education in Białystok and Vilnius regions, and deeper economic, cultural and political ties with Poland. Aside from these core issues, the party is largely non-ideological, the political positions of their members varying from aristocratic conservatism to near-Syndicalism.§!"

 LIT_market_liberal_party:0 "Santara"
 LIT_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Demokratinė tautos laisvės santara                     §gThe Democratic National Freedom League, more commonly known as just Santara, is a minor liberal political party in Lithuania which was first founded by many famous Lithuanian politicians in exile in 1917. Based in Petrograd, this party campaigned for Lithuania's future as a democratic republic and tied its future with the Entente, believing that Russian victory in the Eastern Front and Lithuanian autonomy within a greater Russian federation would be the best outcome for Lithuania as a whole. This never came to be, however, and Santara was thus cast out of any influence in building the foundations of the Kingdom. Santara is commonly known as the 'party of veterans'. Its leaders all became involved in politics before the Weltkrieg and were invited to hold ministries in various past governments, but the party does not command nearly as much influence among the population. It is an outlet for liberal ideas in Lithuania - Santara champions secularism, religious tolerance, liberalism, and sees itself as a mediator between the left and the right.§!"

 LIT_social_conservative_party:0 "LKDP"
 LIT_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Lietuvos krikščionių demokratų partija                    §gThe Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania is the largest party of the Lithuanian right wing, originally founded in 1917, although its predecessor movements are claimed to have started operating as early as 1890. A leading proponent of conservatism and monarchism in the Lithuanian political arena, it laid down the foundations for the Kingdom of Lithuania and has remained an extremely influential party since. Because of its vast size, the party has several distinct wings - some of its members are more willing to endorse liberal ideas and reconcile with the left, others are not; some see Lithuania's future as a loyal disciple of Germany, some are wary of being constantly reigned over by godless Lutherans, others are more nationalistic. Some are influenced by Christian corporatism or even Christian socialism, others are staunch conservatives or free market proponents. Regardless of the wing, however, ideas such as Christian ethics, monarchism, and democracy unite them all.§!"

 LIT_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Lietuvių tautininkų sąjunga                                    §gThe Lithuanian Nationalist Union is the successor to the National Progress Party, founded in 1929, and holds the right-wing nationalist niche which the Christian Democrats have pretty much abandoned. The Nationalist Union unites around the larger than life persona of Antanas Smetona, once the head of the Council of Lithuania and the first Prime Minister of Lithuania, turned the leader of the Lithuanian nationalist cause. The failure of the Memel Uprising of 1928 taught Smetona that militant resistance against the Germans is futile, freedom from their grasp can only be achieved through the ballot, thus the Nationalist Union disdains any talks of armed rebellion and instead seek to implement their ideas (mostly) democratically. It believes in the need of a strong executive, in corporatist and state controlled economics, support for Lithuanian nationalism, and the ever present slogan of 'Lithuania for Lithuanians!'. Despite its professed allegiance to the King and Democracy, it comes into direct conflict with the Lithuanian left wing, which see them as a direct road towards authoritarianism.§!"

Though still ethnic Lithuanian nationalist, it holds more moderate stances.§!"

 LIT_national_populist_party_long:0 "Lietuvos aktyvistų frontas                                      §gThe Lithuanian Activist Front is an underground Lithuanian nationalist movement founded in 1930, in the aftermath of the Memel Uprising. It unites the radical, militant and reactionary forces of the Lithuanian political spectrum, those who cannot find a home in any legal political parties. Knowledge about how the movement operates is very scarce, but it is believed that they have no universally recognised leader and are split among several influential political visions - despite that, however, a unifying feeling of hatred towards Germany, the government in Vilnius, and non-Lithuanians keeps them from dissolving. They spread their ideology through magazines such as Vairas, Naujoji Romuva and Tautos Kelias, as well as organise protests, raids and occasional terrorist activity. It does not contest elections nor has it ever tried to, believing itself to be above the 'psychosis of democracy'.§!"
 
 ### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_VYTAUTAS_II_DESC:0 "'Scandal' roared Lithuanian newspapers in 1928, upon the reveal that the heir apparent of Lithuania was courting a woman beneath his station - to his younger brother, Karl Gero von Urach, this was the end of the world he knew, and the beginning of a horror show. A young man who had once dreamt of becoming an architect was now forced to leave his home in Wurttemberg to rule over a nation. And not just any nation - a nation poorer than the dinkiest German borough, divided between numerous ethnicities and religions and suffering numerous internal political, social and economic problems. Perhaps rightfully so, Vytautas II has been seen as a weak and lethargic puppet of the Seimas, a tool of sycophants, and a laughing stock among European monarchs, ever since his coronation.\n\nIn truth, he is a man consumed by melancholy and crushed dreams. Though he has gained some experience in political operations during a decade of rule, there is nothing he yearns for more than a return to normalcy. A return to his passion for architecture, a return to his home in Germany. Only a strong feeling of duty to his father's will keeps him in the Verkiai Palace."

 POLITICS_STANISLAW_NARUTOWICZ_DESC:0 "Stanisław Narutowicz was the only member of the Council of Lithuania who signed its acts of independence in Polish, rather than Lithuanian, an action which has been interpreted numerous ways - but the one preferred by the elderly noble is that it is a sign that the Lithuanian cause is not just an ethnic Lithuanian or a peasant cause. The nobility and the Lithuanian Poles, such as himself, were just as critical to see an independent Lithuanian state arise. Narutowicz's political career has lasted for decades, starting with the Revolution of 1905, when he started the so-called 'Republic of Alsėdžiai' in the surroundings of his manor, and travelled across the Governorate to call people to the Great Seimas of Vilnius. Narutowicz was a member of the left faction of the Council of Lithuania and campaigned for a republic first and foremost, but ultimately conceded to the monarchist cause.\n\nThe leader of the Committee of Lithuanian Poles is perhaps the only Pole whom even Lithuanian nationalists, such as Antanas Smetona, respect - his efforts for an independent Lithuanian state are well known and so is his unyielding support for democracy, the rights of all minorities in Lithuania, and social justice."

 POLITICS_PETRAS_LEONAS_DESC:0 ""
 
 POLITICS_STASYS_SALKAUSKIS_DESC:0 "Born to a family of petty nobility of mixed Polish and Lithuanian heritage, Stasys Šalkauskis had a modest upbringing,and was one of many in a new generation of Lithuanian speaking intellectuals from the last days of the Russian Empire. His profession of choice was law in the University of Moscow, a decision which would guide his path in life from there on out - experiencing the nihilist, atheist atmosphere of the Russian intelligentsia forced him to cling even more deeply to his Catholic faith, realising that its universalism and compassion, backed by reflective philosophy, is the best answer to the fundamental questions of life. These beliefs were reinforced by correspondence with Adomas Jakštas and studies in the Catholic university of Fribourg, in Switzerland.\n\nŠalkauskis is not a politician by trade and finds philosophy far more comfortable, but his complex vision of a new, compassionate Christian society has swayed many in the Christian Democratic Party. A drive towards an 'optimal system of government', a need for a government guided by solidarity and anti-capitalism, and a holistic interpretation of Lithuania as a synthesis of Eastern and Western culture are the main points of his ideology."

 POLITICS_VOLDEMARAS_DESC:0 "Augustinas Voldemaras began his political career in the Russian Empire. A committed nationalist, he advocated the national self-determination of Lithuania in Saint Petersburg; with the establishment of the German led Lithuanian puppet government following the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Voldemaras returned to his homeland to again fight for its independence. As head of state, Voldemaras is likely to pursue an ultra-nationalist agenda which promotes the superiority of the Lithuanian people and devotion to the state."

 LIT_GENERAL_RASTIKIS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 13th, 1896\nKuršėnai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWhen the Weltkrieg began, the eighteen year old Stasys Raštikis was one of the hundreds of thousands who volunteered for the Imperial Russian Army while overtaken by the war fever. Unlike many of his peers, however, the following four years of war did not erode this enthusiasm - in fact, it only strengthened it. The Russian officers in the Eastern Front and in the Tiflis Army Academy were quick to note the Lithuanian youth's enthusiasm. Upon the conclusion of hostilities in the East, Raštikis was in Georgia, where he and the rest of the Lithuanian cadets residing in the Academy received German approval to return to their homeland. He abandoned his former plans of becoming a priest in favour of pursuing a life in the military.\n\nAt forty years old, Raštikis is rather young considering his rank, but he is a bright and energetic mind, open to new ideas of warfare and loyal to his country. It is said that the bald, stern-faced General is the most politically powerful of all Lithuanian army commanders - he has close ties to the Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania and is a personal friend of Leonas Bistras, while at the same time, he is married to Elena Smetonaitė, the niece of Antanas Smetona. Those claiming that he exerts any influence from the shadows are merely repeating conspiracies, however - dedicated to the military and the good of his country, Raštikis professes complete independence from any political affairs."

 LIT_GENERAL_ZUKAUSKAS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 31st, 1860\nPoškiečiai-Dovainiškiai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe origin, early life, and even birth date of Silvestras Žukauskas, the most elderly and renowned of all Lithuanian army commanders, is a complete mystery, for the man is an enigma, never making any public appearances nor publishing any memoirs. It is not even sure whether his parents are actually Lithuanian, or whether they had immigrated to Lithuania sometime during the 19th century. A Lutheran Protestant married to a Baltic German noble Josephine Hasdorf, he was a cavalry officer in the Imperial Russian Army, reaching the rank of Major General in 1916. He crossed the Soviet-German border in 1918, after the October Revolution, and was appointed the first Chief of Staff of the Lithuanian armed forces, holding this position for over a decade.\n\nThough elderly and reclusive, Silvestras Žukauskas holds insurmountable respect among his fellow Lithuanian officers, and still occasionally offers advice for his younger peers - even though, over the years, the armed forces under his command started to steadily degrade and Žukauskas struggled to garner the initiative for reform."

 LIT_GENERAL_CERNIUS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJanuary 6th, 1898\nKupiškis, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe call for volunteers to the Lithuanian Army reached Jonas Černius, the son of a bricklayer, while he was still enrolled in the Panevėžys Gymnasium, but that did not stop him from abandoning his past life in order to become one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian Army. He was handpicked as one of the few soldiers in the Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces to further their military education in Berlin, where he became a military engineer - perhaps because he inherited his father's passion for construction and building. During these studies, he became acquainted with Stasys Raštikis, who had also been sent to Berlin as a part of the Lithuanian mission, and the two of them became close allies. Wherever Raštikis proposes reforms and changes to the Lithuanian army, Černius is sure to follow suit, the two generals united by nationalist pride and loyal service to their fatherland."

 LIT_GENERAL_SKIRPA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 18th, 1895\nNabajūnai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in the northernmost reaches of Lithuania, Škirpa never once questioned his Lithuanian identity, unlike several of his peers, and proudly declared himself to be a patriot since the earliest days. The February Revolution in Russia saw him, an officer stationed in Omsk, travel across the entirety of the disintegrating Empire, through hardship and danger, until he reached Vilnius in the first half of 1918. Seeing the Council of Lithuania paralysed and the Germans have free reign in his homeland disappointed him, however. Against the will of the Council and the Ober Ost administration, he organised a Lithuanian volunteer unit in Vilnius, engaging in street clashes with Polish paramilitaries and raising the flag of Lithuania atop the Gediminas Tower on January 1st, 1919, before it was taken down by German authorities the day after.\n\nDespite this futile resistance, he ended up acquitted and became one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian army. It is suspected that Lt. General Škirpa had a hand in organising the Memel Uprising as well, but all that can be said against him is hearsay and rumours. It is a fact, however, that Škirpa is by far the most right wing and nationalist of the Lithuanian high command, holding no warm feelings towards the German occupation he once fought, nor the Poles he has had bad blood with since 1918."

 LIT_GENERAL_REKLAITIS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 6th, 1896\nDaugirdėliai, Suwałki Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in the Alytus region and known among his fellow generals for his strong Dzūkijan accent, Mikas Rėklaitis did not initially wish to be a military officer. He was conscripted to the Imperial Russian Army upon finishing education in the Veiveriai Seminary and served until January of 1918, when he was taken prisoner by advancing German forces and remained in captivity for most of the year. He was freed in November of 1918 and began organising self-defence units in his home region. These units ended up integrated into the nascent Lithuanian army and Rėklaitis accepted his new career in life. Among other things, he is responsible for the drafting of the Infantry Unit Organisation Statute of the Lithuanian army in 1923, and has remained a firm supporter of the role of the foot soldier on the battlefield since."

 LIT_GENERAL_VITKAUSKAS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 4th, 1890\nUžbaliai, Suwałki Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nVincas Vitkauskas was not drawn to a life of war at first. A bright mind and an artistic soul, he was a maths student and a poet before getting conscripted to the Imperial Russian Army - this origin reflects itself in Vitkauskas's texts and memoirs, which always use vivid, expressive language, unusual for an army officer. After two years of service in Ukraine, he returned to his homeland once again, where he signed up for Lithuania's armed forces - there, he gained the reputation of a lenient, socialite commander, who preferred to win the hearts and minds of his men instead of instilling discipline to them through force.\n\nVitkauskas's career in the Lithuanian army has been difficult. Unlike many of his fellow politically neutral officers, he does not shy away from the fact that he disapproves of the Christian Democrats and the Nationalist Union, and holds progressive political views. This has led to him being passed over for promotion several times in his past - only the intervention of Stasys Raštikis ensured that he would finally acquire the rank of Major General he was worthy of in 1935."

 LIT_GENERAL_ZELIGOWSKI_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 17th, 1865\nAšmena/Oszmiana/Ashmiany, Vilna Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLike many of his fellow Lithuanian commanders, Lucjan Żeligowski started his career in the Imperial Russian Army - the difference is that, upon the fall of the Tsarist regime, he swore not to the nascent Kingdom of Lithuania, but rather to the Polish nation next door. Commanding the 4th Polish Rifle Division in Kuban, he ultimately became the supreme commander of all Polish volunteer units in the Russian Civil War, fighting alongside the Whites in southern and eastern Russia. Żeligowski finally crossed the Russian-German border in 1919, but what he saw shattered his dreams - the Polish nation he sought to fight for had been reduced to a shadow of its former self, beset by political instability, and holding but a smidgen of all of its rightful land. His friend Jozef Piłsudzki was imprisoned by the Kaiser's minions and Poles kowtowed to Berlin's will.\n\nDefeated, Żeligowski put aside the dreams of unified Polish people for now, and focused on the task at hand - to speak for the Poles in Lithuania, and to strive for Lithuania where Poles are free to express their culture - and perhaps, one day, unite with their brothers in south."
 
 LIT_GENERAL_LADIGA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 25th, 1893\nIškonys, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nKazys Ladiga's military career started with his service as a reconnaissance scout in the Imperial Russian Army - for his bravery and several wounds he endured, he was awarded the Cross of St. George. He was one of the few Lithuanian officers who did not defect after the February Revolution - instead, he remained in service until February of 1918, when he and his entire unit were taken prisoner by advancing German forces in Dunaburg. Ladiga remained imprisoned for almost a year until he was found by Konstantinas Olšauskas, a delegate from the Council of Lithuania, and bailed out in order to join the developing Lithuanian armed forces.\n\nKazys Ladiga is a staunch abstinent and Christian, but suffers from nefarious voices claiming that he is a communist sympathiser - after all, he remained in the Russian Army even after the October Revolution, unlike his peers, who defected as soon as the military began to disintegrate."

 LIT_GENERAL_ADAMKAVICIUS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 30th, 1888\nPikeliai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nIt is said that Aide-de-Camp Edvardas Adamkavičius, serving in the 64th Kazan Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army in 1915, was responsible for reviewing the lists of newly recruited officers. Among this list, he saw one or two Lithuanian surnames - and immediately reached out to those men to speak to them only in Lithuanian from then on out. A stalwart Lithuanian nationalist and a respected general, Adamkavičius was one of the first volunteers in the Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces upon his return in November of 1918. Though of somewhat poor health, owing to miraculously surviving a bullet going through his head during the Weltkrieg, the moustached general commands great respect from his peers and junior officers."

 LIT_GENERAL_PLECHAVICIUS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 1st, 1890\nŽidikai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nPovilas Plechavičius hails from a family of wealthy farmers in Samogitia. Upon the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, he was a cavalry officer in the Imperial Russian Army and fought in the Eastern and Caucasus Fronts, reportedly getting wounded twenty nine times, and yet returning for more every single time. The October Revolution found him while he was stationed in the Caucasus, but did not discourage him one bit - posing as a Cossack, he joined Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army and fought alongside the Whites against the Bolshevik uprising in the Russian south. Though his service there was brief, it instilled Plechavičius with a deep and seething hatred for communism - alongside his brother Aleksas, he returned to Lithuania in the fall of 1918.\n\nPlechavičius found Lithuania in chaos and disorder, infested with bandits and Bolshevik sympathisers, where the German authorities held a tenuous grip. He organised a band of Samogitian men, which soon grew into an army, and enacted a policy of White terror in northern and western Lithuania. Though his methods were effective in restoring order in his home, even receiving tacit German authority approval, the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania was horrified by the brutality. Threatened by the Social Democratic deputy Liuda Purėnienė with legal action, Plechavičius defended himself simply: 'Honourable justices, if me or a person like me weren't there at the time, none of us would be sitting here today'. He was acquitted, albeit controversially, and became a folk hero among the Lithuanian military."

The Seimas, according to the project, shall be divided into three Houses - a universally elected 'House of Ideological Communities', a 'Little Seimas' composed of Federal representatives, and a 'House of Corporations' directly elected from trade unions, business owners, and agricultural communities. Each of the three Houses of the Seimas will appoint five ministries, all of whom will be controlled by the State Control Commission and finally overseen by the King.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the project is to form an 'optimal state', one where the voice of any citizen is heard, one whose inhabitants identify with 'Lithuania' as a concept rather than one of many numerous ethnic groups, much like they had in the Grand Duchy centuries past.\n\nThis state, according to Šalkauskis's vision, will serve as a bridge between East and West and lead all of humanity to a new age.\n\n§CFederalisation Progress§!: [?LIT_federalisation|0+]%"

 LIT.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania"
 LIT.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania was officially founded on December 11th, 1917, and this declaration reiterated on February 16th, 1918, by the Council of Lithuania, a body of Lithuanian politicians and public figures elected in the Vilnius Conference during the Weltkrieg. The formation of the Kingdom was far from easy, however - the declaration split Lithuanian nationalists and forced the republican-leaning Social Democrats (LSDP) out of the Council, while it only took until 1919 for the Germans to take the declaration of independence seriously. Ultimately, they confirmed Wilhelm von Urach as Mindaugas II, the first King of Lithuania since 1263.\n\nThe Constitution of 1920 established Lithuania as a bicameral constitutional monarchy, guaranteeing basic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and universal suffrage. To this day, it remains one of the most liberal constitutions in the Reichspakt. Lacking serious competition, the Christian Democrats (LKDP) have formed the government since the country's inception, while the economy of the country remains dominated by German Junkers and company branches. The absolute majority of them are established in Vilnius, declared a city for 'German Development' - the lion's share of foreign investment is directed there and it has become a jewel of the Oststaaten, a place where you can hear five different languages on your way from the grocery shop. The rest of Lithuania is underdeveloped, however. This is most obvious in the so-called 'Outer Lithuania', the Slavic-speaking southern districts, which, more often than not, look like they are stuck in the 19th century.\n\nVytautas II, also known as Karl Gero von Urach, is the King of Lithuania since 1928. The incumbent Prime Minister is Leonas Bistras, representing the Christian Democrats."

 LIT.2.t:0 "Memory of the Memel Uprising"
 LIT.2.d:0 "Nationalism in Lithuania, briefly quenched by the declaration of independence at the end of the Weltkrieg, saw a resurgence during the 1920s. The laws of free expression allowed a revival of Lithuanian culture - numerous nationalist inclined arts and culture movements began to appear, the Prussian Lithuanian philosopher Vilhelmas Storosta-Vydūnas initiated a revival of the old Lithuanian faith, and dissatisfaction with Lithuania's Oststaat status started to rise. These nationalists started to rally around the Party of National Progress (TPP) - a minor nationalist party founded in 1916 and led by Antanas Smetona, one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence, who ended up sidelined after independence due to his conflict with the Christian Democrats.\n\nIn 1928, upon the death of Mindaugas II, Lithuanian nationalists sought to take advantage of the disorder and seize Vilnius and Klaipėda. The attack on Vilnius never took place, while the one on Klaipėda became known as the 'Memel Uprising' or 'Memel Massacre', resulting in the death of 50 armed militiamen at the hands of the German garrison. Smetona distanced himself from the uprising, the TPP dissolved under the public backlash and reformed to the Nationalist Union (LTS), while the event became a rallying moment for Lithuanian nationalism.\n\nNowadays, Lithuanian nationalists remain split between two approaches. Those rallied around Antanas Smetona and the 'moderate' LTS believe that it is possible to achieve a second National Revival through democratic means. Others have become disillusioned with what they perceive as a sham, however. Uniting the most radical and extreme strands of Lithuanian nationalism is the informal movement known as the Activist Front (LAF)."

 LIT.3.t:0 "The Government of Leonas Bistras"
 LIT.3.d:0 "Representing the Christian Democrats (LKDP), Leonas Bistras is the fifth Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lithuania, appointed after the election of 1933. A doctor by profession, Bistras is an active member and chairman of the Party and, as expected of the Christian Democrats, a devout Catholic. Since the beginning of his term, Lithuania has experienced economic growth thanks to growth in Germany and Lithuania's close ties to its economy, as well as education reforms. This economic growth means that the Bistras cabinet is confident in its stability enough to consider projects once seen as nothing but impossible dreams, such as acquiring Lithuania's own port or organising land reform.\n\nDespite this, it is expected that this will be the last time the Christian Democrats head a majority government alone. Minority parties, such as the Committee of Poles in Lithuania (LLK) and the Jewish Labour Bund (Bundas), are growing stronger, and so are the Social Democrats (LSDP), having recovered their strength after the slump in the 1920s. Finally, the growth of Lithuanian nationalism has culminated in the Nationalist Union (LTS) becoming a serious challenge to the establishment. Though dismissed as a party of violent radicals, their leader, Antanas Smetona, is committed to achieving his vision through democratic means.\n\nWith the planet drawing closer to... something, it remains to be seen where Lithuania shall turn."

 LIT.7.d:0 "Białystok, like the rest of the Kingdom, hasn't been spared from the brunt of the effects of Black Monday. This has further aggravated tensions between the Lithuanian Polish and Jewish communities within the city. This has stemmed from the Jewish businesses being able to weather the effects of Black Monday due to their tight knit community and Polish Jewish Bund affiliations. As a result, many Polish businesses have gone under, and in some cases being bought by their Jewish counterparts, serving as a further slap to the face.\n\nMany have turned to Stanisław Narutowicz, the leader of the Committee of Lithuanian Poles, desperate for some form of relief from the situation. After a short meeting, Narutowicz with other Lithuanian Polish leaders have stated that they would need to turn to Vilnius for support and this could mean a reduction in autonomy in the region."

This had lead to them reaching out to those in Warsaw with sympathetic ears and small enterprise been set up in the city to assist those Lithuanian Poles in need. The growing resentment towards the Jewish community has boiled over resulting in several Jewish owned businesses being targeted by arsonists, who were heard shouting in thick Masovian accents denouncing the Bund and comparing them to syndicalists. Order was restored quickly, though the offenders have seemed to have disappeared into the night, with rumours circulating that the arsonists weren't locals. The following morning, it is evident that the Poles in Białystok are looking away from Vilnius and towards Warsaw for their needs."

 LIT.10.t:0 "Cracks in the Bund"
 LIT.10.d:0 "General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania has a turbulent history, to say the less. Formed in 1897, the Bund promotes the idea of a 'Nation in a Nation', with it strongly advocating for the use of the Yiddish language as a Jewish national language and promote Socialist ideals that borderline Syndicalism in their nature.\n\nThe first split was when Lithuania was annexed by Germany from the Russian Empire, resulting in the Bund seceding from the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia. Now a second split is occurring with the Litvaks (Lithuanian Jews) and Polish Jews in Białystok butting heads over the direction of the Bund. The Litvak community generally wish to promote the Nation with a Nation idea and there are those who wish to be become more politically active as opposed to the Polish Jews, with Zionism gaining traction amongst its community and the promotion of Hebrew over Yiddish. With the no common ground to be found between the two groups, the Bund has further fragmented between those in the South and those in the North."
 LIT.10.a:0 "Wait, how does this affect the steel works in Białystok?"

 LIT.11.t:0 "Reaction of the Bistras Government"
 LIT.11.d:0 "The Black Monday and the ensuing economic crisis has left the country completely unprepared. The government of Leonas Bistras operated with the belief that the Tirpitz golden era will outlast them, and thus did not build up a sufficient money reserve to counter the crisis. An emergency session of the cabinet has been summoned to consider all possible solutions for recovery.\n\nThe summit has sharpened the long present divisions within the Christian Democrats. A growing wing of the party finds itself enthralled by the ideas proposed by the professor and Christian ideologue Stasys Šalkauskis, a proponent of democratic corporatism and federal devolution of the Kingdom. This 'Federalist' wing believes that assuring autonomy from the German markets and rallying the trust of the people in corporate economics can help weather the crisis.\n\nPrime Minister Bistras is not willing to throw the Germans under the bus, however. He and the old guard of the party have instead drawn up a series of initiatives known as the 'Galvanauskas Plan', named after our Minister of Finance. This plan involves the development of a sustained industrial heartland in Vilnius and Kaunas and bailing out the worst off of the German Junkers to keep foreign capital flowing into the country.\n\nThe announcement of this plan has not resonated well with the Lithuanian people, however. The inhabitants of the Southern regions, so-called 'Outer Lithuania', protest this abandonment, and so do the Social Democrats and the Nationalist Union. In their eyes, this reliance on German investors is what caused the crisis in the first place. The first results of the injected surplus seem to be positive, however."
 LIT.11.a:0 "Let's see how it goes."

 LIT.12.t:0 "German Investors Abandon Lithuania"
 LIT.12.d:0 "The Galvanauskas Plan has not yielded the results which the government has sought - German businesses and investors continue abandoning the Lithuanian market. Their companies are liquidating what little assets they have left and are putting their facilities on sale in order to recoup at least some of their losses.\n\nNature does not tolerate a vacuum, however, and other actors are starting to take advantage of this investor flight. In Vilnius, several of the most notable companies have been purchased by Jewish business owners, unions and worker cooperatives, many of them in cooperation with Lithuanian and Polish entrepreneurs. The Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, wielding its influence within the community and especially among Jewish labour unions, several of whom it directly operates, helped orchestrate these buyouts. Native companies in Kaunas and Białystok, Lithuanian and Polish respectively, have begun buying out former German assets at a low price, seeking to wrest control of the market from German competitors after having been suppressed for many years by not so clean business practices.\n\nThe transition has been far from soft, however. Thousands of workers in Lithuanian cities have been laid off and are starting to radicalise. The local companies organise these buyouts with pretty much all of the remaining assets they have, leaving their future uncertain - and, in fact, many of these freshly established cooperatives and companies are reported to declare bankruptcy in the following weeks. Should we cling onto our guns, our economy will go through this transition and come out more independent - however, when it is so painful and so difficult, will we even be able to weather the storm?"
 LIT.12.a:0 "The longer term is what matters."

 LIT.13.t:0 "Call for Land Reform"
 LIT.13.d:0 "The question of land reform was one which the first governments of Lithuania had failed to answer. In the aftermath of the Weltkrieg, many of the manors across Lithuania ended up abandoned and ripe for taking - the Polish nobility started repatriating, and Russian nobles fled for their homeland. Radically-minded members of the legislature called for distributing the land to the poor and the landless, and this measure was even endorsed by several members of the Christian Democrats, such as Mykolas Krupavičius, who saw this as a way to stifle the growth of socialism among the peasantry. Ultimately, however, no consensus was reached and many of the abandoned manors were bought out by Germans at a low price. Large agribusinesses established themselves in the Lithuanian countryside, causing resentment among the landless peasantry and even serving as a way for some German families to settle down in Lithuanian territory.\n\nBlack Monday has changed the situation in the countryside, however. Many of the formerly thriving conglomerates are now desperately trying to sell their land, even at the lowest possible price, and pull out from the country to save operations in their homeland. This presents an opportunity for the Lithuanian government to step in, buy out the land and ensure a fairer distribution of land ownership in the countryside."
 LIT.13.a:0 "Change is needed, then."

 LIT.14.t:0 "Nationalist Union Rallies"
 LIT.14.d:0 "The news of growing Bundas influence in the Vilnius industrial hub and other major cities have begun to rouse major dissent among the population. This dissent is, first and foremost, raised by the Lithuanian Nationalist Union (LTS). Their deputies in the Seimas, most notably Antanas Smetona, have begun speaking out against the transition of industry in Vilnius, and have lodged bill after bill trying to break this monopoly. Younger, more active and frustrated members of the Party have taken matters into their own hands, however, and started organising mass protest rallies across cities such as Kaunas, Šiauliai and Vilnius.\n\nTheir anti-semitism is thinly-veiled, if hidden at all - these nationalists call for a 'Lithuania for Lithuanians' and their marches, more often than not, devolve into violence, such as vandalism of German or Jewish owned shop fronts or, in some cases, direct assault against peaceful citizens. The following sparked a harsh reaction from the Constabularies - several of the most radical activists were detained, while additional police officers were dispatched to ensure order in the cities.\n\nImmediately upon the conclusion of this nationalist fever, eyes were turned towards the leaders of the Nationalist Union, Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras. Both of them handled the situation tactfully, however. Smetona publicly denounced the actions of what he described as 'loose cannons barely affiliated with his party'. Voldemaras was under police investigation due to suspicions of having a hand in these actions, but they were cut short and Voldemaras himself expressed his support for the stance of his party's leader."

 LIT.15.t:0 "Recovering German Business"
 LIT.15.d:0 "After a period of falling out, a small upsurge of investment in Lithuanian businesses by German investors has been registered. Soon enough, the Seimas has received a petition from several of their companies, requesting a second chance. They promise that, if they are provided with grants, loans and preferential status in the Lithuanian market, they promise to maintain operations in Lithuanian territory and provide employment for their citizens, helping us recover from Black Monday."
 LIT.15.a:0 "I suppose Germans have their uses."

 LIT.16.t:0 "Nationalist Marches Continue"
 LIT.16.d:0 "Nationalist activism has been continuing across Lithuanian cities for months, sparked by poor economic conditions, the Government's perceived reliance on German interests, dissatisfaction with Jewish dominance over the Lithuanian sector, and Lithuania's status as one of the Oststaaten. However, as time passes, it seems that the initial hostility raised by the riots seems to have faded. No more cases of violence or vandalism are being reported and even some of the most unsavory slogans have been dropped in favour of more moderate ones, though they still call for expanding Lithuanian autonomy and ensuring Lithuanians as the superior ethnicity in the Kingdom. Any and all ideas of acting against the LTS have had to be dropped for now.\n\nThe Nationalist Union has been running a very strong campaign in general. Despite his advanced age, Antanas Smetona has been campaigning everywhere from Palanga to Vilnius, and so have all of his underlings, each of them offering an alternative to Syndicalism and Christian conservatism alike, a strong, national rule, free from the shackles of foreigners, a chance for Lithuania to carve its own fate. For the first time since its founding, the Nationalist Union may provide a challenge to the established parties in the election."

 LIT.17.t:0 "Palanga Agreement"
 LIT.17.d:0 "In 1920, the first democratically elected government of Lithuania was forced to sign a punitive agreement regarding the trade flowing in and out of the country. According to the terms of the agreement, all Lithuanian foreign trade must flow through the ports of Memel, Libau and Riga, all three of which controlled by Germany and its Ducal puppet state. The agreement also stipulates harsh restrictions on the types of production which are allowed to be traded through the ports, and several types of tolls. Ultimately, it means that Lithuanian foreign trade is severely restricted and reliant on the German whim.\n\nOne of the campaign promises of Leonas Bistras and the LKDP was to re-negotiate the agreement and 'carve Lithuania out a window to the West', and now they are ready to act upon this promise. Palanga, Lithuania's sole town on the coast of the Baltic Sea, holds the potential of becoming an adequate port, if only the Germans allow to ease restrictions on local docks and shipbuilding. While preparations for the diplomatic mission are ongoing, our Ambassador to the German Empire, Jurgis Šaulys, offers support in the form of contacts among German businessmen and diplomats - of course, this would come with a price."

A powerful economic crash has shackled the Empire and the rest of the Reichspakt, and its ripples have reached Lithuania as well.

His contributions to the Bundist movement and the left-wing movement in the Russian Empire in general cannot be understated, and neither can his efforts to reestablish the General Labour Bund in Vilnius after the end of the Weltkrieg. At the end of his life, he has seen the Bundas achieve the apogee of its power in Lithuania thanks to Black Monday, and could give away the reins of the organisation in peace. His successor is Victor Alter, a youthful Jewish labour activist and leader of the left wing of the Bundas.\n\nVictor Alter immediately took the Bundas in a new direction. While his predecessor was wary of involving the Jewish community in politics and instead opted to just endorse policies most beneficial to their members, Alter is a strong supporter of the Social Democratic Party and an opponent of the growing current of anti-semitic nationalism. This has culminated in an official agreement between the LSDP and the Bundas. The Bundas has offered its funds to the Social Democrat campaign and agreed to a coalition ticket - several Jewish labour leaders shall stand under the Social Democratic Banner in their constituencies, and all Lithuanian Jews are encouraged to support this joint ticket in the next elections.\n\nThough the right wing has begun crying out about 'Jewish syndicalist infiltration of the LSDP', they can only concede that the leader of the Social Democrats, Steponas Kairys, has made a yet another successful move."

Faced with successful campaigns from the LSDP and LTS alike, an emergency meeting of the Christian Democratic party has been held to formulate a response. In the meeting, the Prime Minister was blamed for an inability to predict an economic downturn and failing to prevent the party's rivals from taking advantage of the downturn. Bistras tried to defend himself to the best of his ability - and, ultimately, as a sudden new speaker declared, the blame rests on everyone's shoulders. Decades of unchallenged leadership have left the party complacent and unwilling to present something anew.\n\nThis speaker was Stasys Šalkauskis, a Lithuanian professor and ideologue, the founder of democratic, federal corporatism in Lithuania, which he dubs the 'Optimal System'. Though he has only been a member of the party for a few years and only entered politics recently, he had already gathered a strong base of support from young, active members of the party. Šalkauskis presented the tenets of his program, calling for a corporatist, integral economical and political system, and reconciliation with Lithuania's numerous ethnic groups under a federal democratic government. The ultimate goal of the 'Optimal System' would be a nation where all of its members can live up to Christian teaching and values, where everyone's voice is heard in the government and where everyone knows they contribute to a greater whole.\n\nLacking the stamina or the charisma to try to sway the mass of the party back to the old guard, Bistras opted to concede, allowing Šalkauskis to speak for the duration of the meeting."

Since then, it has consistently scored the districts in the Białystok region, and Polish-majority neighbourhoods in Vilnius such as Naujoji Vilnia. The venerable leader of the Committee is Stanisław Narutowicz, one of the signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania - due to his age, experience and non-confrontational attitude, he is respected not just by Lithuanian Poles, but by many Lithuanians as well.\n\nAs the election of 1937 of approaches, the Committee has strengthened its grip over the Białystok region, and its endorsement may be critical in winning the election."

Of course, the Nationalists are uninterested in such an idea entirely.\n\nThe Social Democrats have long been endorsing the idea of pluralism - granting wide cultural autonomy to all of the ethnic groups within Lithuania, promoting multiculturalism and socialist internationalism, and though most of the members of the Committee are put off by the idea of Syndicalism or even democratic socialism, the idea of pluralism eludes them. Stanisław Narutowicz has received a personal phone call from Steponas Kairys, the leader of the LSDP, offering cooperation in the electoral campaign and a coalition afterwards.\n\nHowever, the Christian Democrats have not been any less active in enticing the Polish vote. Now led by Stasys Šalkauskis, they reach out to several high ranking members among the party, explaining their program of federalisation and offering autonomy greater than the Social Democrats could ever promise.

Ultimately, this has resulted in a split in the Christian Democratic Party - a sizeable portion of the old guard, led by Mykolas Krupavičius and Vladas Mironas, have broken ties with the LKDP leadership and declared the founding of their own party, the Homeland Union (Tėvynės sąjunga).\n\nThe Homeland Union claims to be the successor of the old traditions of the Party and, according to the polls, they are sweeping much of the conservative countryside and stealing votes in others, putting a halt to the Christian Democrat train, possibly killing its momentum in this election for good.

As naval officer Povilas Julius Labanauskas would later write in his memoirs, they had to use a yellow sheet as a base for the flag and paint the necessary colours in less than twenty minutes before authorities from the headquarters showed up, so they had to make do with what they had - and as the Chief of Staff arrived, he witnessed not the Lithuanian green and red bicolour flying in front, but a yellow-green-red tricolour, as the top third of the flag had not gotten painted in time. One of the officers almost immediately compared the flag to that of Ethiopia, calling it 'something African', but Raštikis's opinion was different - he played along, called it 'a quaint banner' and gave the Lithuanian Naval Force the permission to adopt the tricolour as their symbol.\n\nThough born out of a complete mistake, the Yellow-Green-Red Tricolour has become the flag of the Lithuanian Naval Force - even if it will forever remain the butt end of jokes."

Junior officers in the Lithuanian army, taught in German academies, have returned with a similar outlook towards warfare. These officers such as Antanas Sidabras, Sergejus Fanstilis and Juozas Tomkus have been calling for a Lithuanian armoured unit to be formed. Despite the reluctance of conservative officers, the General Staff eventually agreed, and a commission of officers has been formed to search for a possible armour design for Lithuania to adopt.\n\nOur cadre of officers have identified several tank designs which could be adopted for our armed forces, each one coming from a separate foreign arms company. Each design has its advantages and disadvantages, as well as associated costs.

 LIT.74.d:0 "Born Ludwik Władysław Franciszek Kondratowicz in the village of Smolków, Władysław Syrokomla was one of the great romantic poets of the 19th century. Despite his short life, Syrokomla's poems (written mainly in Polish) resonate deeply among Lithuanians as an example of multi-cultural Polish-Lithuanian identity.\n\n Coming from an impoverished noble family, Syrokomla suffered tragedy after tragedy in his early life. He had to abandon his studies early due to financial problems, and three of his four children passed away in the same year. In 1844, he published the first of his poems, 'Pocztylion', under the pen name 'Władysław Syrokomla', a name he took from his family's coat of arms. Eventually, he rose to become the editor of the Kurier Wilenski, the largest and most prestigious Polish language in the Vilnius area. However, after taking part in an anti-tsarist demonstration in 1861, he was arrested by the Russian Okhrana and sentenced to house arrest - dying a year later, virtually penniless.\nHeavily influenced by fellow Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, Syrokomla's poems dealt with the liberation of peasants and the dream of a free Polish-Lithuania. While he wrote in Polish, he acknowledged himself as Lithuanian as his birthplace was located in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also wrote several poems in Belarusian due to his fascination with the society and culture of 19th century Belarus. An icon among the Lithuanian literary world, Syrokomla's works illustrate Poles, Lithuanians, and Belarusians."

As curious onlookers, young and old, begin viewing the statue with fascination, they are drawn to a curious inscription on the bottom:\n'Ludwik Kondratowicz Władysław Syrokomla 1823-1862. The little bird will ask God to lend a hand, to help the poor man bear his bitter lot. To have the strength to carry his cross. To make it to the grave without complaint.'\n\nThe words on the state are indeed a solemn memento mori. Syrokomla died young, struggling with his lack of education and his deep poverty. Yet the poet's deep lyrics resonate to an audience more than seventy years later... a testament to his accomplishments."

 LIT.100.t:0 "The Optimal System"
 LIT.100.d:0 "The political views of Stasys Šalkauskis stem from his Christian upbringing and his experience of both 'Western' and 'Eastern' culture. Having studied in Moscow and Friburg alike, he came to view Lithuania as a fusion of 'rational' Western culture and 'emotional' Eastern culture, believing both of these rudiments to be equally important and Lithuania as something unique in the world history. It is a bridge between East and West, a nation which is able to manifest the best features of them both, if only its cultural and political system is reformed to optimally draw out these rudiments and create a truly pluralistic, democratic state.\n\nŠalkauskis has been a maverick in Lithuanian politics for as long as he has participated in them. Though a believer in social justice and a harsh opponent of free market capitalism, he denounced socialism as demagogic and atomistic, and based his beliefs in Christian compassion and solidarity rather than revolutionary thought. He believed his fellow Christian Democrats to be 'inquisitioners', rather than politicians, too. In his eyes, Christian democracy should carefully weigh the balance between individualism and socialism (which he saw as a reaction to individualism, i.e. capitalism) and draw out the benefits of them both - and the way to do so is through federal corporatism.\n\nLike many Christian politicians, Šalkauskis believed in economic corporatism. The entire country needs to be organised into economic, cultural, political and spiritual corporations - and these corporations unite into even greater units, federations. These federations would work autonomously, resolving social issues amongst themselves without the need for extensive government involvement. Politically, these federations would manifest as autonomous Lithuanian, Belarusian, Polish and Jewish entities within a united Kingdom; economically - as federations of trade unions and chambers of commerce; spiritually and culturally - as a universal belief in Christian ethics and compassion, serving as the strings which knit the society together. It should be noted that Šalkauskis did not believe in the imposition of Christianity over Lithuania's non-Christian subjects, such as Jews - in his eyes, Christian ethics, such as those professed in the Decalogue, are universal amongst all humans, even if they carry different names in different religions."

The Prime Minister's wish is to outline it according to cultural lines - however, the mere mention of determining the ethnic composition of Lithuania brings up several competing viewpoints. Some overblow the Lithuanian population, some Polish, some Belarusian, and the reason is that because previous censuses in Lithuanian territory were inaccurate, prone to nationalist fact-twisting and uncertainties regarding certain nationalities. A new census is thus planned to take place and settle all debates once and for all.\n\nThe Lithuanian census of 1937 can be organised swiftly, allowing the government to quickly move on with the issue and start on other projects in the Optimal System plan, or we can take our time to make sure the data is as accurate as it can possibly be."

Prime Minister Šalkauskis is more passive towards the organisation than his predecessors, seeing it as an example of what an economic corporation envisioned in his works would look like - however, his opposition towards socialism, which Bundas espouses, and dissatisfaction with the Jewish corporation outcompeting other ethnic groups have led to him approving a plan to curtail its influence.\n\nUnder orders of the Christian Democratic government, several state-sponsored trade union federations have been founded, most notably the Lithuanian Christian Labour Federation (Lietuvos krikščioniškoji darbo federacija) and the Central Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Handwork (Centriniai prekybos, pramonės ir amatų rūmai), uniting Lithuanian labourers and business owners respectively.

Though this is different in minority schools, this standard curriculum remains from Palanga to Białystok. The drive towards federalism forces us to reconsider our approach to language education.\n\nPrime Minister Šalkauskis's dream would be to have each student in the country, Lithuanian, Slavic or other, to learn Lithuanian and one Slavic language of choice, to allow interconnection between the Kingdom's population - but German authorities continue to enforce mandatory German language education for all students, and loading them with three mandatory languages to learn would be horrifying.

The Prime Minister's calls for cultural autonomy, reconciliation with the Poles and Belarusians, and a deep belief in social justice have led many right-wing Lithuanian nationalists to denounce him as a closet Syndicalist, a traitor to the Lithuanian people, and a sell-out to the Slavs. This activism is further radicalised by the poor conditions caused by Black Monday and ethnic polarisation in Lithuanian cities stemming from the Bundas's takeover of industry there. It manifests itself in the form of mass protests, vandalism, or even outright assaults against political opponents. Several skirmishes between armed nationalists and police forces have been registered across the country, resulting in dozens wounded and the country shackled by terror.\n\nIt is believed that this violent activism is the work of the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), an underground organisation of Lithuanian nationalists seeking to free Lithuania from any and all foreign influence."

This mood was quickly replaced with a sense of ease, with Šalkauskis firstly thanking Alter and his Bundas for their support during the turbulent days of Black Monday, and added that this level of charity will not be forgotten amognst the Lithuanian people. Šalkauskis continued, that though his Christian believes, poltical views, and way of life may clash with Alter and the Bundas, they have the same end goal, being the betterment of their fellow man. For this, Šalkauskis and is government is willing to overlook certain aspects of the Bundas. Of course, Alter knew there would be a 'but', with Šalkauskis expressing the need for the more radical members of the organisation to be reeled in. Upon completion of his sentence, Alter's cohort began conversing amongst themselves in a mixture of Polish and Yiddish. An argument had broken out between certain members, complete with coarse curses being exchanged, but was then silenced by Alter slamming his fist on the table, and in Lithuanian, telling two of his cohort to leave. After an awkward silence, these men excused themselves from the meeting, and left the room. Alter excused this outburst, with Šalkauskis and Alter hammering out the finer points of this compromise."

He called for his fellow Poles to resist the Šalkauskis government and its efforts for reform. This speech has been broadcasted through radio across much of Białystok Region, and it seems that many of those listening to him express support to his atomising ideas.\n\nPerhaps it should be no surprise, given that Kościałkowski is a notable Polish irredentist and has gotten into trouble with the authorities over his anti-Lithuanian remarks before, but it should also be noted that our census has sparked Polish resentment which Kościałkowski simply used to his advantage..."

It has been reported that with each day, the progress of the Optimal System seems fruitful as more and more Lithuanians are identifying as Lithuanian despite their numerous ethnic backgrounds. With the end goal of Lithuania being a nation that expresses both western democratic values and eastern tradition, proponents of the Optimal System have argued that the system will only lead Lithuania forwards.

The philosopher vehemently denies this as an attempt to grant the monarchy stronger executive powers, however, citing that his belief is that the monarch must be an apolitical unifying figure first and foremost. Needless to say, this question in the project has yet to be resolved, and this has led to people like Antanas Maceina interpreting the idea as necessitating vast executive powers, even undemocratic ones.\n\nKing Vytautas II and the cabinet of ministers have been discussing this dilemma, however, and as the Optimal System project is coming to a close, he is willing to present the results of their compromise in a speech to the nation."

Their primary goal is to establish the Lithuanian 'unitary state' - a fully centralised Lithuania. Nonetheless, despite their nationalistic rhetoric and hatred for German monarchs, Smetona's Lithuanian Nationalist Union has agreed to change its stance on the monarchy. In a move unforeseen by observers and the press, the king has decided to meet with the Smetona regarding the future of Lithuania's leadership. There are heated tensions on both sides, especially since Smetona will undoubtedly demand power for himself and his party, and few expect an actual compromise to be made. Smetona's popularity has eclipsed that of the king, and if a settlement is to be made, it would involve the king relegating his duties.\nNevertheless, the King has arranged a proclamation to the people of Lithuania, which will no doubt more clearly delineate his anticipated future role."

This has caught many on the back foot, with members of the Smetona's party protesting the decision to put a 'Pole' into this position. Many believe this is another power move to ensure the loyalty of Balstogė and the Poles within the Kingdom, with a common enemy in the East rearing its head towards Lithuania. \n\nSmetona's first announcement as Regent was to rebrand the title as 'Tautos Vadas', Leader of the Nation, which he states is a more 'Lithuanian' title.

The first priority of the Nationalist Union in the economic department is to enact sweeping land reform, requisitioning unused land and setting maximum limits to the amount of land one person might own, and distributing government land to the landless and those who own very little land. Unlike the land reform plans proposed by the Social Democrats, however, Smetona's 'national land reform' has a political bent as well. Priority to distributing government land goes to Lithuanian speaking farmers, while non-Lithuanians such as Poles and Belarusians are not prioritised, and, even if they do receive scraps, this land is usually granted deep in Lithuanian-speaking territory, as an attempt to force more non-Lithuanians to move northwards and start assimilating them.

Most of the detained activists have been let free with no charges, as the judges declared that the accusations directed towards them are not reason enough for any sort of jail time. Several were forced to pay fines or given a few months of arrest for less than savory articles or actions, while the few Aušrinė leaders who fell at the hands of the government received no mercy.\n\nAll in all, while the results were less than satisfactory, the true meaning of the process soon became clear - it was not a matter of arresting anyone, but rather to instil a message to the opposition of Antanas Smetona and his government.

Smetona bid his time, however, carefully building up influence in Lithuanian right-wing circles, keeping the radical nationalist forces under his leadership on a leash to maintain electability, and finally dealing the final blow in the snap election of 1937 to overcome both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats.\n\nAs unbelievable as it might have been a mere four years ago, Antanas Smetona is now the new Prime Minister of Lithuania - and with Black Monday successfully put under control, the unyielding, soft-spoken, yet controlling leader of the Nationalist Union has declared in a speech that his government is ready to fulfil the next part of their program. Right now, Lithuania is a weak state - but it is a weak state because it is plagued by internal divisions, be it cultural or political, and the previous governments were incapable to put them under control. They allowed Syndicalism to foster, they were blind towards the developing process of 'Seimocracy' - an unbridled parliamentarianism and detachment between the government and the people.\n\nWhat Lithuania needs is a strong, popular leader who can guide the nation to a brighter tomorrow. It shall ascend to a unitary state, a nation of one people, not of many peoples - whether it wants to or not."

The following years will require the government of Antanas Smetona to balance between the wishes of its radical faction and their moderate allies, and ultimately marginalise both in order to push through the Prime Minister's own vision of the Lithuanian state.\n\nThe Nationalist Union will seek to improve the Lithuanian heartland and guide businesses and other economic operations to establish themselves there, and resolve the issue of German and Jewish businesses controlling Vilnius. The Southern administrative divisions, long controlled by Polish and Belarusian representatives and acting as a thorn in the Prime Minister's side, will need to be curtailed, their autonomy eliminated and loyalty instilled. The rest of the Kingdom will need to express the same loyalty, as well.\n\nAntanas Smetona's ultimate goal is to remove the Privy Council of the King and declaring himself to be the 'Tautos vadas' ('Leader of the Nation') - not merely a Prime Minister appointed by the monarch, but a powerful guide, who knows what the Lithuanian people truly want, bypassing the bureaucratic swamp of the Seimas and operating under the principle of 'Pasakyta - padaryta!'

 LIT.156.d:0 "In his campaign to promote the Lithuanians as the domineering ethnicity in their Kingdom, Antanas Smetona has always seen the large Jewish population as a dilemma. On one hand, the Lithuanian Jews, or 'Litvaks', are far more integrated than any other large minority group in Lithuania, their representatives were supporters of Lithuanian independence during the Weltkrieg - they may even be called a 'model minority'. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the Lithuanian nationalism which courses through the LTS's veins is deeply tied to anti-semitism. Lithuanian nationalists hate the fact that Jewish entrepreneurs are dominating the market, and even their mere presence is too much to bear for some of the radical of the nationalists. Smetona does not support this blatant antisemitism, but looking at the Lithuanian Jewry, he sees something which he can agree is only a threat - the Jewish Labour Bund.\n\nVictor Alter, the leader of the Lithuanian Bundas, has received a private visit from the Prime Minister, where he explained his point of view on the organisation - in of itself, it is a necessary evil, and there are many things which Lithuanians can learn from the productivity and unity of the Labour Bund - however, to tolerate its existence, there are reforms which he needs to undertake. As a show of force, Smetona's right hand man, Augustinas Voldemaras, rallied the paramilitary of the Nationalist Union, the National Guard 'Geležinis Vilkas', to organise loud mass protests surrounding the headquarters of the Bundas, complete with strike teams of armed junior officers ready to burst in at a moment's notice. Alter folded to the pressure, agreeing to Smetona's demands - expunging Syndicalist elements within the Bundas, banning the use of Russian in all publications (with either Lithuanian or Yiddish to be used), and announcing full political neutrality."

 LIT.157.d:0 "The Suwałki region, known as Suvalkija in Lithuanian, has historically been a melting pot of Polish and Lithuanian cultures. As this region was the earliest part of Lithuania to abolish serfdom, thanks to its brief annexation by the Duchy of Warsaw during the Napoleonic Wars, it became the nucleus of the Lithuanian National Revival in the 19th century. Many of Lithuania's leading nationalist figures, such as Jonas Basanavičius and Vincas Kudirka, hail from this region, and even the Lithuanian language has been standardised according to the 'Zanavykai' dialect in northern Suvalkija. However, throughout the 19th century, Polish influence continued to encroach on the region, and towns that were once a core part of Lithuanian culture, such as Sejny/Seinai, have become bilingual or even Polish-dominant.\n\nSince the formation of the Kingdom of Lithuania, the Suwałki electoral districts have been safe constituencies for the Committee of Poles in Lithuania, as their Lithuanian competitors are divided by ideological grounds and could not field a significant challenge. Polish dominated local assemblies have been imposing education in their language, maintain ties with other Polish communities and thus foster the slow Polonisation of the region. Now that the Committee has been broken apart, however, Antanas Smetona's government sees an opportunity.\n\nIt may be possible to orchestrate the formation of a united Lithuanian electoral list in the Suwałki region, which would take advantage of the disunity among the Polish community and retake control of the local assemblies. If a Lithuanian local government is installed this way, not only will it be able to impose policies more acceptable to us, such as Lithuanian language education, funding for Lithuanian communities, and incentives for colonists from the north - but it will also be more loyal to us, allowing us to erode the autonomy of the region. This would cost a lot of political capital, however, as uniting ideological opponents will not be easy..."

However, a much autonomy was kept regardless. One of Antanas Smetona's primary talking points as leader of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union was to put an end to this system and put education in Lithuania solely under the control of the central government.\n\nThe Nationalist Union has lodged a bill in the Seimas which has been simply dubbed as 'Language Reform Law'. The primary goals of the project are to eliminate most of the 'school categories' created by the Leonas Bistras government and put most schools in Lithuania under a unified education program, especially language education. All schools falling under the 'standard' school category would be required to teach Lithuanian and German to all students, and hire native speakers for the former subject - this includes schools in so-called 'Outer Lithuanian' territories, majority Polish and Belarusian regions. The Language Reform Law also includes several other streamlining education reforms unrelated to language.\n\nAnd, of course, it is stapled alongside a bill on the increase of funding for orphanages in the Vilnius region, in order to make sure that any opponent thinks twice about voting against this law and thus making poor children in Vilnius cry.

It appears that Antrasis Departamentas uncovered damning evidence regarding both groups, which if exposed would put both groups in hot water with Lithuanian authorities and those in Germany.\n\nIn the most dramatic parliamentary session for decades, Smetona finally presented the findings on how the German Junkers and businessmen had planned to 'milk the Lithuanian cow dry'. Smetona continued stating that these groups were backed by the Privy Council. To the shock of the Privy Council, the King made no move to defend them.

Once the newspaper of the Party of National Progress, it took a different turn after the Memel Uprising, under the leadership of the journalist and poet Vytautas Alantas.\n\nAlantas and his clique of supporters, such as Jonas Statkus and Domas Cesevičius, believe that it is not enough to simply assert Lithuanian superiority in our nation. The Lithuanian culture itself must be purified and unwanted foreign influences within it must be removed - for it was this inability to purify which led to Lithuania becoming a slave to Poland, then to Russia, and finally Germany. It is even more extreme in its nationalist stances than even the most radical leaders of the Nationalist Union - it has no desire to even pay lip service to democracy, its hatred towards any ethnic minorities in Lithuania is unprecedented... however, they cheer for Smetona and his goals of strong leadership nonetheless, seeing it as a step in the right direction.\n\nIn his most recent work, 'Žygiuojanti Lietuva' ('Marching Lithuania'), Alantas hails Smetona's government, yet at the same time declares that it needs radical reforms. His primary talking point is Christianity, which Alantas does not hide his disdain of. Describing it as an unwanted, destructive influence imposed upon Lithuania by foreign powers, he calls for Smetona's government to break up the influence of clericalism, abandon its pretenses of democracy and embrace the ideals of pagan humanism, a return to the metaphysical of our forefathers, and selfless sacrifice to one's country.

For Smetona, this was a fertile ground to break up his opposition. Narutowicz was the easiest to bend - the two of them knew each other from the days of the Council of Lithuania, and the elderly politician eventually bent under pressure and agreed to enter a political pact of 'non-aggression' with the LTS.

First formulated by Otto Bauer in 1907, it remains the prevailing ethnic policy of the Austromarxist movement, which the LSDP borrows most of its ideas from - what it seeks to achieve is to turn the nation not into a territorial and ethnic entity, but instead a simple association of persons, disjoining the state from its territory. After all, what says that, to be a Lithuanian, you need to live specifically in this plot in Europe and follow a specific set of traditions? As long as you believe yourself to be Lithuanian, hold Lithuanian citizenship, and contribute to the nation, either through taxes or through other ways, what stops you from being considered Lithuanian?\n\nA similar view was espoused by many Bundist Jewish ideologists and thus turned the Social Democrats and the Bundas into natural allies. During their term, the government of Prime Minister Steponas Kairys will seek to undertake significant reforms to achieve their ideal of National Personal Autonomy. Each ethnic group in Lithuania will have their own universal cultural assemblies, with the ability to levy their own taxes and autonomously decide on matters pertaining to their members. Every citizen of the Kingdom would belong to one of these cultural assemblies, but the question of which national movement to join would be a matter of personal choice, and no authority would have any control over his decision.\n\nOf course, these reforms will coincide with LSDP's other policy programs, such as a swift establishment of a welfare system and taking out the right-wing opposition, mostly through legal methods."

The latter strongly opposed the former's proposal of implementing unprecedented pro-labour reforms, such as establishing a national labour relations board and implementing state funding for trade unions. Sidzikauskas' claim is that with each proposal as radical as this one, Lithuania veers closer and closer to Syndicalism. Already, Santara has accepted concessions such as a minimum wage, generous pensions and work safety regulations, but it cannot accept radical policy of this unprecedented scale.\n\nIt falls to Prime Minister Steponas Kairys and his cabinet to figure out their response to this conflict within the coalition."

Originally founded in 1910, it was by far the most left wing of all Lithuanian nationalist societies in the last years of the Tsarist period. Even before the Weltkrieg, it translated the works of Benoît Malon and Pyotr Kropotkin and declared itself to be 'individualist socialist', idealising a society of free communes, liberty and religious freedom. In 1923, after several issues where it openly advocated in favour of the French Communard system, 'Aušrinė' was banned and the society of students which organised around it moved underground, where they continued issuing periodicals and radicalise further.\n\nThough a movement of poets and intellectuals at its core, the 'Aušrininkai' have occasionally participated in acts of terror, such as bombings, assassination attempts and clashes with the police, swiftly turning into a boogeyman for the Lithuanian right. It is also no secret that many members of the Social Democrats Party are acquainted with the movement, either by attending their secret meetings or reading their banned literature - thus it is unsurprising that one of their goals is to lift this ban and put an end to years of Aušrininkai terrorism. How should this legalisation take place, however?.."

One of such is the Lithuanian Group for the Study of French Culture. Officially a non-aligned organisation dedicated to the study of French culture, art and literature after the Revolution of 1919, it is believed to be a method for the spread of Internationale influence in Lithuanian left-wing circles. With the LSDP seemingly turning towards radicalism, the Lithuanian secret services, in cooperation with their German peers, have finally chosen to act. Through secret channels, they have recruited Vytautas Mačernis to investigate the Group and collect information on the future plans of the Party. Equipped with forged documentation of his membership in the Social Democratic Party and a faint, seemingly confident smile, the young poet turned spy heads through the rainy streets of Vilnius to come across the headquarters of the Group in Vokiečiai Street..."

One thing which all of them agreed upon, however, was that German and bourgeoisie domination in Lithuania will not last.

Not because this hope could be miscalculated or wrong, but because the Lithuanian workers need to first be able to trust each other and forge their own future. The events of the last decade only remind us that only those proletarian victories are permanent which the people managed to not just acquire, but to maintain.\n\nThe working class in Lithuania will only be able to take over and establish socialism when the economic conditions of the country place us to proletarian lines or tie the majority of the population to them, when this majority becomes a willing supporter of the socialist agenda.'\n\nThese are words written by Steponas Kairys in 1929, defining and specifying the ultimate goal of the Social Democratic Party - democratic socialism. Needless to say, now that it has actually come to power and has been forced to ally with liberal democratic parties, this policy has come under serious question.

The radical wing of the LSDP has drafted a policy plan to force these right wing officers into early retirement, subordinating the army to civilian authority at the cost of bleeding out the officer corps.

Economic regulations and taxes here are loose, but the bankruptcy or evacuation of our German investors means that a gaping hole has been left in the city's economy. Companies owned by the Bundas and local Lithuanian investors alike have been trying to fill up that gap as much as they can, and both of them protest the pro-German rules and regulations still present.

Today, he seeks an audience with his brother directly, asking for assistance in convincing the cabinet to allow a large Daimler-Benz factory to be established near Vilnius.\n\nThe arrival of such a titan of German manufacturing would certainly provide a boost in revenue as well as a large number of jobs for the unemployed - however, Lithuanian media will certainly pick up the favoritism."

The Iron Wolf's vision of a perfect Lithuanian state has been best expressed by one of the organisation's chief ideologues, cavalry officer Juozas Tomkus, in the underground newspaper 'Tautos kelias'. The Weltkrieg and the years after have proven two things - that all wars from here on out will be won by not just arms and regular troops, but the mobilisation of the entire nation for war; and that Lithuania is destined to end up at war eventually, and anyone foolish enough to believe that these are times of peace has no place in the country. The only way for Lithuania to survive is for it to become an army - from the man in the front to the woman in the back, from the professor in the laboratories and worker in the factories, every single person and every single resource must be dedicated to national defence.

Striking the base foolishly, the defenders fired from fortified sandbag positions and towers, picking off the LAF forces like fish in a barrel. Finally, after substantial casualties, the LAF fled for the woods once more but not before leaving behind their wounded and fallen comrades.

Most of whom initially panicked, the loyalist defenders began a courageous defense using the depot's light machine guns to suppress the enemy. However, the LAF insurgents had vanished deep into the Knyszyn Forest despite their valiant attempts, and the defenders were too exhausted to pursue them.

The city's Jewish population, nearly making up one-third of population, fled from the town in abject fear. However, the cry for help did not fall onto deaf ears, and the alarm reached a local garrison of Lithuanian military that arrived in the town at once. After an intense firefight on the city streets and the LAF fled, but the damage had been done.

The loss of the man who turned the group of activists into true, national revolution, is tremendous to the spirit of his followers, who have started debate to find a worthy successor for the Iron Wolf. Despite cries to find leader among themselves, even the idealists have to admit that two other men left of the LAF leadership, Vytautas Alantas and Antanas Maceina, are perhaps the only two people who can lead the existential battle.\n\nThe debate is bitter - Maceina believes in the eventual destruction of the bourgeoisie, the strength and renewal of the Lithuanian worker, and the end to social and economic injustice. To Maceina, capitalism is the very reason for Lithuania's moral and economic decay, and only through the Church and Lithuanian culture will Lithuania find its path once more. On the other hand, Alantas believes that Lithuania must return to its folk origins, to the days of the ancestors' gods and that the church is nothing more than foreign interference in the history and culture of Lithuania. Alantas believes that society must be heavily militarised, but his stance on economics is far more liberal than the radical distribution of wealth advocated by Maceina. Both men agree that Lithuanian society must be one for and run by Lithuanians only - but it seems that it's rapibly becoming the only thing they agree on.\n\nAfter hours of speeches and politicing, Alantas has finally snapped and denounced Maceina as nothing more than a socialist agent, turncloak who arranged the assisantion of Voldemaras. Maceina's answer was equally harsh, describing Alantas as nothing more than a man with dictatorial ambitions who plans to destroy the Church in Lithuania.

After the gunshots sent one of the three to meet his dear Maker, Voldemaras turns to his remaining co-ruler, Alantas, whose involvement in the conspiracy is still seem shady by many. Voldemaras gives him simple choice - to recognise Voldemaras as the sole and sovereign ruler of Lithuania like any loyal follower should, or face trial for his part in so-called Maceina Affair.

This has resulted in the locals having to use Lithuanian when dealing with the Lithuanian Jews, with most now only speaking Belarusian as a home language. Furthermore, many have begun to view themselves as 'Litvins', an archaic Slavic term for citizens from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

It is a distant eastern suburb of our capital, Vilnius, inhabited almost completely by Polish and Russian minorities. Traditionally, even the Committee of Lithuanian Poles has hesitated to challenge Alseika in his constituency, as the humble, soft-spoken doctor was beloved by people of all ethnicity in the suburb. With his passing, however, it has enthusiastically put forward Jan Piłsudzki, brother of the famous hero of the Polish people in the Weltkrieg, as their candidate. Unsurprisingly, he is supported by an absolute majority of the Polish-speaking population, while the Lithuanian parties in the Seimas fear the lockdown of yet another safe KPL constituency.\n\nA plan has been proposed in the headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party to prevent this fate from befalling the Naujoji Vilnia constituency. While it should not be allowed to redraw constituency borders so close to the date of the election, it is not 'illegal' per se, and the idea is to carefully carve out new borders for the constituency, including non-Polish neighbourhoods in the constituency to balance out the Polish vote. At the same time, a smear campaign will make sure that the Belarusians, Russians and Lithuanians do not cast a single vote for Piłsudzki, which should ensure a victory for the Christian Democratic candidate, Antanas Šmulkštys.

For the following year, all government officials, bureaucrats and pensioners are required by law to purchase a specified amount of geese, depending on one's ranking within the bureaucratic apparatus and wage, at a minimum of one. As proof of goose transaction, all farmers selling these birds have been required to sell them with numbered cards, which would then be turned in to the government by the person purchasing geese.\n\nAlthough certainly an unorthodox way to solve the economic ills of the country, it has actually paid off somewhat.

He believed rational science, metaphysics and Christian ideology to all stem from the same source, the divine Logos, and thus a good Christian should seek a unity of theological, philosophical and scientific knowledge. This drive for unity should reflect itself in society - Jakštas advocated for amending the Schism and restoring a single, universal Christian church, he believed that class warfare should be replaced by class cooperation, driven by Christian ethics, and he was the first in Lithuania to introduce the idea of the United States of Europe, which his home country Lithuania should champion and join. He was an internationalist - he believed that 'open-minded and open-hearted people' who would support these ideas exist in every country, repressed by the ignorance of the masses, and should they join a single worldwide organisation, they would be able to guide the world towards the absolute Truth and absolute Good.\n\nPerhaps because of this reason, Jakštas has had a deep interest in Esperanto ever since its creation, and chaired the Esperanto Federation of Lithuania until his death, believing it to be an important step towards his internationalist ideals."

It is widely considered to be a seminal event in the growth of the Lithuanian National Revival, as it was started with nationalist intentions in mind - to improve the economy and people of the country, to promote Catholic ideals, and to stand against a prevailing Tsarist policy to turn a blind eye towards alcoholism, in order to keep the populace intoxicated and thus easy to control.\n\nThe priesthood of Kaunas refounded the temperance movement in 1908, in the form of the Lithuanian Catholic Temperance Brotherhood. Since then, it has been an important mass movement and pressure group in Lithuanian politics, uniting over sixty thousand members as well as maintaining close alliances with other Lithuanian religious organisations.

Centuries of cultural proximity and unity under a single nation have left many Belarusian-speaking peoples, especially aristocrats and intellectuals, identifying with Lithuania as their homeland, seeing it not as a nation-state, but as a multicultural union of various nations, cultures and languages.

During his forty years of life, Kudirka accomplished much in the name of the Lithuanian nation, most notably writing the hymn 'Tautiška giesmė', which has since become the national anthem of Lithuania. Unlike his fellow patriarch of the National Revival, Jonas Basanavičius, Vincas Kudirka had a much more defined political program. He believed that patriotism alone would not be able to revive the Lithuanian nation, thus it was the duty of their generation to educate the Lithuanian peasantry, improve their lives and fight in the name of social justice. Though he passed away in 1899, before the independence of Lithuania could be established, his thought has had a profound impact on Lithuania since. It is said that Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas, a famous leader of Lithuanian radical socialists, chose his alias in honour of Kudirka - Kudirka's pen name was 'Kapsas', while Mickevičius was only 'Kapsukas', meaning 'little Kapsas'. On the other side of the political spectrum, right-wing Lithuanian nationalists also claim his memory for themselves, they note his stance against Polonisation and nationalist outlook.\n\nIn honour of this anniversary, a statue for Vincas Kudirka, designed by the sculptor Vincas Grybas, is planned to be erected in Vilnius.

Though traditionally seen as a Polish uprising against Tsarist rule, it gained significant traction in Lithuania as well, where it coincided with peasant unrest over an unsatisfactory abolition of serfdom. It is considered to be a turning point in Lithuanian history - while the uprising in Lithuania still hoped to join Poland in a federation, the Lithuanian National Revival which sparked in the years after finally disjoined Lithuanian national identity from that of Poland, and turned these nations from comrades into enemies. Antanas Mackevičius and other Lithuanian members of the January Uprising, while still supporters of a Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, had a far more concise national identity than their brethren in the decades beforehand. At the same time, the uprising fought for social justice, the rights of the peasantry, and other radical ideas, which has made it an inspiration for the Lithuanian socialist movement in the years after.\n\nIn an independent Lithuania, the November and January Uprisings are most commemorated by Polish Lithuanians, as a means of expressing the centuries long connection between the Polish and Lithuanian nations. Now, they seek to fund a memorial in Krekenava, which, alongside Mackevičius, would also commemorate other leaders of the uprising in Lithuania, such as Zigmantas Sierakauskas and Konstantinas Kalinauskas.

It was the first Constitution published in the Old World, and while it only lasted in effect for less than a year, it has had a profound impact on the political thought in the region, being the culmination of Enlightenment thought in Poland-Lithuania. However, while it is unquestionably important in Polish historical memory, it does not hold the same respect among Lithuanians. After all, it was the same Constitution that sought to abolish the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and establish the unitary Kingdom of Poland in its wake - and while this was prevented with the Reciprocal Guarantee of the Two Nations a few months after, it does not change the fact that this Constitution is seen as something 'foreign', rather than something 'Lithuanian' as much as it is 'Polish'.\n\nRegardless, the pressure to recognise May 3rd as a commemorated date remains.

A cultural icon in his home country, responsible for popularising foreign travel and interest in geography, his death has been met with shock and surprise from the Lithuanian people. Salcius has been buried in an unknown cemetery in Bolivia, but his heart has been brought back to Lithuania where it has been buried in Vilnius."

 LITFLA.16.d:0 "Lietuvių draugija prancūzų kultūrai pažinti (Lithuanian Group for the Study of French Culture) is an organisation of left-leaning Lithuanian poets and writers with the official stated purpose of learning about the culture of France and how it has been affected by the Revolution of 1919. Notable members are Salomeja Neris, Vincas Krėvė and Petras Cvirka. It is widely considered to be a front for the influence of the International in Lithuanian writing circles."

 LITFLA.17.t:0 "To an Organic Lithuanian State"
 LITFLA.17.d:0 "Far from all Lithuanian Catholics are aligned with the Christian Democratic Party, its stated goals and vision, or even its support for democracy. A growing new generation of religious activists and intellectuals concentrated in movements such as the Catholic youth journal 'Naujoji Romuva', having forgotten the long struggle of the Lithuanian nation before the Weltkrieg, see it for what it is - a state shackled by petty politicking, German domination, and social injustice. The ideals of this movement are most expressed in the works and activities of Antanas Maceina, culminating in him and many of his peers publishing the manifesto of the Young Catholic movement, 'Į organišką valstybę' ('To an Organic State')\n\nThe primary enemy of the Young Catholic movement is social and economic injustice, spurred by Distributist influence, and in their manifesto, Maceina calls for radical land reform, redistribution of wealth and the uprooting of 'bourgeoisie-liberal thought' from the Lithuanian identity. Even the Catholic Church would not be safe from redistribution - after all, one can worship Christ without gold and silk, so why should the Church hold onto its wealth when there is so much suffering they could alleviate? In place of capitalism, they push forward a society of economic democracy and Christian corporatism. However, they challenge Syndicalists and social democrats alike by declaring that only an ethnically pure society can be socially and economically just. To them, Lithuania can only be Lithuanian, and a Lithuanian must live and die immersed in national and Catholic culture. While the Naujoji Romuva nominally believe in democracy, they also express that 'temporary' strong hand leadership is necessary and even mandatory to achieve all of their radical reforms.\n\nThe Young Catholic movement sits with the Lithuanian Activist Front, occupying a left-wing, Christian national distributist niche."

 LITFLA.18.t:0 "The Vairas Steers Right"
 LITFLA.18.d:0 "While all in the LAF seek to free Lithuania from foreign influence, others raise the question of how its subjugation happened in the first place and how to avoid it a second time. This movement, the most right wing faction of the LAF, is known as the Vairas ('the Wheel'), named after the nationalist journal their followers took over in the 1930s, and their leader is the writer and ideologue Vytautas Alantas.\n\nAlantas declares that it is not enough for Lithuania to break free from German domination - the goal of the LAF should be to form a truly 'national ideology', to liberate Lithuanians spiritually, culturally as well as physically, for as long as they think like slaves and see themselves as slaves, they will remain slaves. In his eyes, the first National Revival was a failure, as it failed to form a truly free Lithuanian state, so the Vairas should be the flag-bearers of a second one, one which will last forever. It disdains Christianity, believing it to be a foreign influence imposed upon Lithuanians, and instead looks towards pagan traditions, which, in Alantas's eyes, are the truest expression of Lithuanian national identity - it idealises a dream where the Lithuanian nation is subservient to a truly nationalist society under a single unquestioned leader, the Vadas, whose citizens are willing to give their life for the Nation, which worships traditions of time immemmorial instead of 'the psychosis of democracy'. Despite their totalitarian intentions, it maintains liberal economic intentions, its leaders such as Domas Cesevičius expressing that a Lithuanian National Revival must create a society where every Lithuanian can achieve wellbeing through his own effort and individual innovation.\n\nThe Vairas movement sits with the Lithuanian Activist Front, occupying a far-right wing, totalitarian nationalist niche."

While Lithuania has not been a beacon of stability in the past months either, some refugees have found their way here.\n\nAs they do not have connections, and some younger ones do not even speak Lithuanian, they are integrating slowly. This problem will only be solved by government intervention."

 LITFLA.20.t:0 "Ignas Šeinius - The Red Flood"
 LITFLA.20.d:0 "Ignas Šeinius, Lithuania's most famous impressionist writer, has recently published a new book, 'Raudonasis tvanas' (The Red Flood) that has just breached Lithuania's prison in literary obscurity.\n\nMuch like his famous 'Kuprelis', The Red Flood is a gripping impressionist tale about a love story between two young individuals in a divided country, but what is must interesting is the setting of the story. The novel takes place in an alternate timeline where the Brusilov Offensive was successful and knocked Austria-Hungary out of the Weltkrieg in 1916. This leads to a chain of events that result in an Entente victory. Germany is engulfed by revolution and becomes a Syndicalist nation, while Russia experiences a coup led by Kolchak, supported by the Black Hundreds, and becomes a totalitarian ultra-nationalist dictatorship. Europe is soon embroiled in war once more, and Lithuania becomes a front line, a bloodbath between the Germans and Russians, where even the strongest men perish and die in minutes. The end of the novel hints at a possible Russian breakthrough, as well as a naval invasion by the still-extant British Empire...\n\nThe book has been criticised for horrid descriptions of cruelty and war crimes, but Šeinius defends his tale, saying that 'something like this could have happened in another Universe'."

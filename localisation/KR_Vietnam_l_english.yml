POLITICS_HUYNH_PHU_SO_DESC:0 "Huynh Phu So, called Xen as a child or as he is known more commonly now as Duc Thay - the Virtuous Master - or as Duc Huynh Giao Chu - the Virtuous Sect Founder and Patriarch Huynh - or more simply the Living Saint or Living Buddha of Vietnam, may look like a mere young man at first glance, but this young man stands as the most dominant and beloved figure in all of Vietnam. Born in the village of Hoa Hao along the Mekong in 1920 during the hellish transition period between the French and German colonial regimes, Huynh’s life was met with hellfire from the moment of his birth. Born into a moderately wealthy peasant family, he was plagued with illness as a boy, but his bravery convinced his father to send him to the Seven Mountains to learn how to be a man from the famous hermit mystic Doan Minh Huyen. Upon finishing his training some years later, So had apparently gained the ability to heal the sick and cure the insane, curing even himself before going on to become a wandering teacher of his own form of Buddhist thought. Over the years, this unique form of Buddhism would evolve into Hoahaoism, and his proselytization of these inflammatory works only enraged the German colonials, prompting his arrest on more than one occasion, even being imprisoned in a psych ward for a time after the Germans tried to convince the colony he was insane. However, with each arrest, the Living Saint only grew more and more in popularity, fueling his eventual rise atop the back of his fanatically loyal volunteer army of nationalist zealots and diehard loyalists originally called the Followers of Xen. Now as the syncretic and mystic leader of this new Vietnam, the Virtuous Master Huynh now guides Vietnam the best he can as more and more of the apparatus of state falls under the control of the nationalist army of his own creation. Though he shall always be the face of Hoahaoism, how much say the Living Buddha truly has is not fully known."

### Initial Tree ###

VIN_Administrative_Reform:0 "Reform the Administration"
VIN_Administrative_Reform_desc:0 "For better or worse, the current crisis has only proved the ineffectiveness of our government. In order to win the support of the people, we must undergo the arduous task of reform. When we finally triumph over the Vietcong insurgents, we will be able to proudly lead a government that attends to the needs of all of its people."
VIN_Anti_Syndicalist_Rhetoric:0 "Anti-Socialist Rhetoric"
VIN_Anti_Syndicalist_Rhetoric_desc:0 "In order to combat the Vietcong insurgency against our government, the Imperial Council has approved a large-scale propaganda campaign to educate the local population about the dangerous threat that Socialism poses to the Vietnamese way of life."
VIN_Cabinet_Reorganization:0 "The Emperor's Great Proclamation"
VIN_Cabinet_Reorganization_desc:0 "We have finally triumphed over the Vietcong insurgents and are ready to lead the nation towards its destiny. The victorious Bao Dai has moved to dissolve the Imperial Council and will make a formal proclamation regarding the reorganization of His Majesty's cabinet. Both the Vietnamese people and Ostasien officials are anxious to hear the outcome of the Emperor's decision."
VIN_Economic_Efforts:0 "Mobilize the Economy"
VIN_Economic_Efforts_desc:0 "The uprising has already taken a heavy toll on our economy, and we have been forced to gamble with our own survival. To help alleviate this issue, the Imperial Council has been tasked with finding a way to fill our coffers with much needed funds."
VIN_Education_Reform:0 "The Role of the Examination System"
VIN_Education_Reform_desc:0 "For nearly a millennia, the great dynasties of Vietnam have relied on Confucian civil service exams to select those worthy of serving the nation. As we turn a new page on the future of Dai Nam, we must finally decide on the status of these exams. Traditionalists within the council cite these exams as an important symbol of our history while Westernizers see it as nothing more than another example of our antiquated past."
VIN_Imperial_Council:0 "Convene the Imperial Council"
VIN_Imperial_Council_desc:0 "To combat the Vietcong insurgency, Emperor Bao Dai has formalized the creation of a national council to guide the nation through this time of crisis. Religious leaders, local politicians, as well as the German delegation have all been invited to help guide the nation through this difficult time, each bringing their own unique proposals to shape Dai Nam's destiny."
VIN_Military_Mobilization:0 "Raise a National Army"
VIN_Military_Mobilization_desc:0 "While the fires of revolution burn ever brighter in Indochina, we cannot expect to rely on our severely outmanned militia forces to help maintain order. The Imperial Council has been called again to devise a plan to mobilize an effective fighting force that is capable of defending our homeland from the encroaching Vietcong forces."
VIN_Our_Social_Agenda:0 "Extend an Olive Branch"
VIN_Our_Social_Agenda_desc:0 "While many within the VNQDD have taken up arms against our government, several workers and peasants within our nation still believe in their ideals of Democratic Socialism. We must extend our mercy to these remaining few to show we are truly a government for all of Vietnam!"
VIN_Pacification_Effort:0 "Increase Pacification Efforts"
VIN_Pacification_Effort_desc:0 "While we have control over the major cities of Hanoi and Hue in part thanks to German assistance, the rural countryside is dominated by Vietcong forces. Loyalists holding out against the VC have requested His Majesty's government send aid to these holdout communities. Each faction of the Imperial Council is sure to have their own solution to this problem."
VIN_Purge_Sympathizer:0 "Purge Sympathetic Socialists"
VIN_Purge_Sympathizer_desc:0 "The traitorous VNQDD have chosen the side of the Indochinese enemy, and many of their cells still operate within our borders. We must swiftly deal with this fifth column before we are utterly destroyed from the inside!"
VIN_Secure_Foreign_Assistance:0 "Secure Ostasien Aid"
VIN_Secure_Foreign_Assistance_desc:0 "Much to the displeasure of nationalists within our council, we cannot undervalue the contributions that the German government has made towards supporting our struggle. We will negotiate with Singapur to send another aid package to help supply our woefully under equipped army with much needed rifles and supplies. In addition, we will negotiate with German business here in Hanoi to help support the army."

### Cao Dai ###

VIN_Absorb_Vietcong_Program:0 "Integrate the Insurgents"
VIN_Absorb_Vietcong_Program_desc:0 "It is hypocritical to preach peace and unity while we actively hunt down the remaining Vietcong cells still operating in the countryside. Enough blood has been spilled and the time has come to bring the nation together under the Divine Eye. Amnesty will be offered to Vietcong who lay down their weapons and significant welfare reform will be put in place by our government."
VIN_CaoDai_Republic:0 "The Beatific Republic"
VIN_CaoDai_Republic_desc:0 "The false Emperor Bao Dai’s proclivity to suckle at the teet of the German imperialist has proven without a shadow of a doubt that Vietnam has evolved past its need for a monarch. Thus, the leaders of the Caodaist faith have agreed to follow a republican agenda, cooperating to create a theological and spiritual republic that combines all the beliefs and needs of the people of Vietnam. No longer shall our golden shore yield to foreign needs, for if our religious revolution is to succeed, we must first consolidate our hold here in the homeland and ensure that all are taken care of and on board for our future syncretic plans."
VIN_Consolidate_Rural_Bases:0 "Consolidate Rural Parishes"
VIN_Consolidate_Rural_Bases_desc:0 "During the Indochinese revolt, Caodaist parishes in the rural countryside were able to effectively hold out against the Vietcong. With the war finally at an end, we can send much needed support to these loyal holdouts and finally bring order to the lawless countryside."
VIN_Convergence_of_Five_Religions:0 "Convergence of the Five Religions"
VIN_Convergence_of_Five_Religions_desc:0 "Caodaists believe that their religion provides a perfect synthesis of the Five Great Teachings of the past: Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, the various ancestor and folk religions of old humanity, and the Abrahamic Faiths of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. These five broad religions shall form the foundation of our one united humanity under the Caodaist doctrine, and the tenets of these Five Religions shall form the structure of our new society and civilization. We will prepare for the Convergence, no matter the cost!"
VIN_Cuong_De_Restoration:0 "Cuong De's Restoration"
VIN_Cuong_De_Restoration_desc:0 "With Cuong De's arrival in the Imperial City of Hue, we must now undergo the preparations for the rightful Emperor's restoration. Many within our government believe that this coronation ceremony could be a perfect symbol of prestige and unity for our nation. Invitations will be sent out to foreign dignitaries and festivals will be organized throughout Vietnam to celebrate this momentous event. The coronation of Prince Cuong De will symbolize a new era in our nation's history."
VIN_Elevate_Women_Status:0 "Elevate the Status of Eve’s Daughters"
VIN_Elevate_Women_Status_desc:0 "The Caodaist philosophy is explicit on many aspects of how society should be organized, including the role of women. Women are to be held in equal status to men, with many famous women throughout human history such as Joan of Arc and Mother Mary being held in high regard within the faith. As such, our society must respect women and hold them on an equal footing as men, while delegating them to the societal positions that best suit them.

Serving as his capital floating in the heart of the Mekong Delta at Ben Tre, the Phoenix Island compound is to be massively expanded into a true floating city complete with industrial and agricultural centers and a temple complex bigger than anything else in the nation.

Led by bandit turned revolutionary General Le Van Vien and master criminal General Duong Van Duong, the Binh Xuyen force may be diverse, divided, and barely cohesive, is temporarily united around one goal and is hellbent on cleansing Vietnam of its liberal sins once and for all. Coming together as a disorganized but effective and terrifying maelstrom of violence and villainy, this raucous horde now tries to steer Vietnam in one direction or the other, with the cracks of in-fighting and internal power struggles already beginning to show."
VIN_Stand_With_Vien:0 "Stand Fanatically with Bay Vien"
VIN_Stand_With_Vien_desc:0 "As the peace within the Binh Xuyen Force collapses and in-fighting once again begins, the bulk of the Force’s manpower have decided to stand resolutely with their leading general Le Van Vien, also called Bay Vien or ‘Vien the Seventh’. Known for his background as a police officer under the colonial regimes before he joined the Force and for his interest in politicking, diplomacy, and scheming, Bay Vien has further gain infamy for making deals and temporarily collaborating with the Chinese, the Japanese, the Germans, the French, the failed Indochinese revolutionaries, and many more, including various religious orders and the factions of Bao Dai and his ‘Miracle Man’ Diem that fell in order to fuel our rise, all in the name of gaining power for himself and his allies while honing his skills as an officer and master of subterfuge. Along the way however, he has picked numerous different and immensely varied philosophical and political ideas over the years, fueling his dive into theory and away from the mindless banditry of his comrades as he attempts to fuse them into one coherent ideology that benefits himself over all others. By his hand, Vietnam will embrace a new breed of Revolution, one all his own design."

Representing a pragmatic and clearly opportunistic, if strange and disjointed, ideology that incorporates Leftist economic ideas and notions of classless societal and social progress while embracing Rightist cultural and nationalist ideas based around Vietnamese exceptionalism and Southeast Asian primacy. Though the wider force is split on whether to take the National Revolutionary ideology in a more-explicitly Far-Left or Far-Right direction, for now we shall walk the tightrope between worlds and ideologies as Bay Vien guides Vietnam his own way towards nationalist honor and a prosperous, sovereign, and controlled fatherland."

A master criminal and accomplished bandit known for rampaging up and down southern Vietnam before establishing himself firmly as the leading kingpin of the Mekong region, Ba Duong seeks to abandon any and all pretenses of politics and ideology, instead seeking to full embrace his so-called destiny of becoming the most successful, most feared, and most respected crime lord of Southeast Asia and beyond, all while caring for his own along the way."

Though he has a despicable and reviled reputation for being a bloodthirsty, cunning, and brutally efficient mob boss, pirate captain, and criminal mastermind, he has an equally beloved reputation among Vietnam’s most isolated poor for being the Robin Hood figure to the downtrodden masses. Even stealing from the rich and giving to the poor at times, Ba Duong is warden of the rainforests and protector of Vietnam’s seas, guarding and caring for the peasantry in any way he can as he and his men continue their criminal dealings and bandit rampage through other lands."

Holding honor, both personal and familial, above all while holding intense patriotic love and nationalist fervor for Vietnam as a while, this doctrine has bred an army of unruly but fanatically deadly and zealously loyal madmen - each a wild veteran ready to do and die for their nation should the need arise. In our off time, the men of Binh Xuyen may be bandits, pirates, thieves, mobsters, murderers, hitmen, and more, but when Honor and Fatherland are on the line, we are the best line of defense Vietnam has ever known, and now, we are all they got."

As we hold Honor and Fatherland in our hearts, we defend our bandit kingdom from all those who would try to take our bandit paradise from us, for this land is ours to protect and do with as we please. We are the Black Fiefdom of Indochina - a dark mark on the map to be avoided at all costs, for there are no monsters here; just men with nothing to lose and everything to gain.

The funds from these sources shall be distributed among the masses, with the excess used by the government to fund our exploits and ambitions.

Wiping away both political enemies and enemies of the state and people, each member is guaranteed to be fanatically loyal to the extreme, with a hand at running the nation and defending our living god, for without him, our claim to rule is nothing."

We must revive these ideas and engrain them into the modern culture of Vietnam and her people, living once again in a more traditional way while forcing the masses to once again respect the life that has come before them, creating a pious, serene, and ascetic society that values filial piety, the value of our past traditions and figures, and the importance of the natural world we live in, for we must be the guardians of these things we hold dear."

Huyen took our prophet Huynh Phu So in as a child to teach him the ways of the mystic and the divine, and now Huynh Phu So lives as the reincarnation of the Buddha Master of Western Peace, the title of his old hermit-master, by spreading his teachings. We must help the spread of these venerable ideas and make it the dominant strain of Buddhism in Southeast Asia, for it forms the basis of the millenarian Buddhist ideas our faith holds central and dear, and because it truly is the salvation of mankind.

These various ideas come together to form the basis of our new faith, morals, culture, and nationalist identity, for the people of Vietnam are the manifestation of this Good force on Earth, and as such, it is our duty to fight the darkness wherever we find it while spreading the proven and singularly true faith to all mankind."

In order to unite humanity into a peaceful utopia with no hierarchies that is enlightened by the true faith, we must act now and unite mankind. However, by watching the rest of the world and the horrors they commit in the name of false causes, it is clear to us now that seeking a peaceful option is a fool’s errand. Utopia can only be achieved with peace. Peace can only be achieved by unity. Unity can only be achieved through faith and struggle, and faith and struggle can only be resolved through war, so let them come. We have a race to save."

This is Vietnam's darkest hour, but our country will be and must be saved with the Emperor's iron will and iron fist, but he cannot do this alone. To help guide the nation through these difficult times, the Emperor has assembled a privy council of German advisors, local politicians, and religious leaders. An unlikely coalition between democratic parties and the Confucian traditionalist, Pham Quynh, urges the Emperor towards a moderated stance to gain the trust of the population during a time of crisis. Representing the small yet influential Catholic minority is the ambitious governor Ngo Dinh Diem, who advocates for a heavy-handed approach towards dealing with the rebellion. Pham Cong Tac, spiritual leader of the Cao Dai movement, has urged the Emperor to call upon a mass movement towards defeating the Vietcong insurgency. The Ostasien attaché has also made the Emperor well informed about the colonial government's benevolence as well as the fruits of continued cooperation with the Reich. While these varying groups are all united towards preserving the nation, it is the Emperor alone who must decide the uncertain future of the empire."

vietnam.1.d:0 "In order to defeat the Indochinese insurgency, the council has been tasked with building up a military force from scratch. The Ostasien government has already offered their help to train an elite group of Vietnamese soldiers, but nationalists are advocating the creation of a more independent force based on local police forces and imperial guards. Religious groups have proposed that we mobilize the masses for our anti-syndicalist war, calling upon religious militias from the Cao Dai and Catholic communities."

The army has proposed two possible counterinsurgency strategies: we could use large units to conduct sweep missions to search and attack Vietcong forces, or we could focus on consolidating the security in several strategic positions, and expect they improve the security in surrounding areas like oil spots. While Vietcong control is strong, some anti-syndicalist rural communities like the Catholics and Cao Dai are still resisting Vietcong influence; it's also possible to allow their villages to form self-defense militia and distribute arms among them."

The French colonial regime tried to abolish it in 1918 but were ultimately unable to due to the turmoil caused by the Great War. With the exception of a small contingent of cultural conservatives, almost everyone within the Imperial Council has agreed that the Confucian examination system should be replaced with a new education system.

In order to pay the militias and police forces that constitute our ‘army’, the council has proposed different ways to acquire funds. Constitutionalists within our council have suggested that we issue war bonds that can boost our economy without having to raise taxes. The German advisors have predictably supported taking out another loan from the Kaiserreich in order to pay for our expenditures.

Fearing an emerging crisis, the Imperial Council has been tasked with dealing with these refugees. The moderate constitutionalists within the council have proposed that we should resettle the peasants into villages that are in areas that are firmly under our control. Governor Ngo Dinh Diem has suggested that we should move these peasants into state of the art defensive hamlets that can resist the Vietcong insurgents. Religious sects such as the Cao Dai have put forward a plan to convert these refugees into militia forces that will be able to fight for the lands that were stolen from them by the Vietcong.

With Cuong De adorned in a most lavish and extravagant outfit fusing traditional Vietnamese noble designs with the iconography of the Cao Dai faith, the hall within the Imperial City of Hue the ceremony was being held in was the only thing decorated more beautifully than the Emperor’s own clothes. With decorations of gold, jade, pearl, and more, lavish seating areas complete with lucious furs and tapestries, and with art and Cao Dai idolatry adoring the temple from end to end, the coronation’s setting would be fit for the Left Eye of God itself, let alone a mortal emperor. Perhaps more interesting than the decor was the massive list of those guests in attendance, for not only was the soon-to-be Emperor’s large extended family, cadre of allies and confidants, and the entire Vietnamese nobility invited, for Cuong De called for guests both across Vietnam and across wider Asia to be in attendance for his ascension. \n\nFrom prominent and regal figures among Asia’s many monarchies and nobilities such as members of the Namgyal, Wangchuck, Aisin-Gioro, Yamato, Khun Lo, and Norodom dynasties as well as the Duke Yansheng, the Marquis of Extended Grace, the Celestial Master and Living Buddha Zhang Enpu, the Bogd Gegen of Mongolia, and the Dalai Lama of Tibet to name a few, along with many other lesser rulers - particularly from India and wider Asia’s large assortment of lesser royalty. Additionally prominent Pan-Asian authors, movements, and thinkers that have conversed with Cuong De or support his Pan-Asian ideas, such as Shumei Okawa, Ikki Kita, Ryohei Uchida, Hayashi Fusao, Li Dazhao, Ram Manohar Lohia, Lee Kuan Yew, Sun Fo, Zhang Jinghui, Nicholas Roerich and his family, representatives of the famed Mongolian freedom fighter Gada Meiren, the wider Black Dragon Society’s leaders, the leading members of the Dark Ocean Society, and many more, have arrived to offer their best blessings to the newest face of the Pan-Asian struggle. Also paying their respects are the influential leaders and figures of Vietnam’s largest religions, such as the heads of the Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, and event Coconut faiths, though interestingly, the Catholic clergy of Vietnam - called colonial puppets of France by Cuong De himself - have been barred from attending the ceremony. Overall, the coronation was an extravagant, almost otherworldly affair whose grandiosity and splendor only marks the beginning of how high this new Emperor and his Vietnam shall aim for."

Much to the Emperor’s outrage, Diem and his allies have organized a referendum to decide the fate of the centuries old Nguyen Dynasty. To ensure that our referendum is successful, our supporters have mobilized an intensive propaganda campaign that reveals the truth about Bao Dai’s hedonistic lifestyle and his ties to the German Empire. Bao Dai and his cronies have launched their own campaign to slander Diem as a tyrant and the Emperor as Vietnam’s savior and rightful ruler. Religious groups such as the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao have also warned their followers against voting for Diem, inciting fears that the Diem government will outlaw their religious sects and establish Catholicism as the state religion.

Our charismatic sovereign openly admits that he would much rather wear a nicely tailored suit while performing his day to day duties as sovereign. However, traditionalists within the Emperor's cabinet have argued that these robes are a symbol of Vietnam's rich history, while more reformed-minded Westernizers support the Emperor's more modern look.

His mind had entertained the thoughts that the money was somehow embezzled or even stolen. To make matters worse, he would have to report these expenditures to the Emperor. Later that day, as the young magistrate made his way to the Emperor on his throne, he felt as if he was going to collapse. As he tried to stammer out some sort of excuse for the missing funds, something brilliant caught his eye. As the Emperor ruffled his golden robes, the Mandarin noticed something gleaming under his sleeve. On his wrist was a solid gold watch that was studded with diamonds, each of its golden arms moving in perfect unison. ‘Yes?’ the emperor asked, looking disinterested as ever atop his golden throne.

From the southern deltas, the young Huynh Phu So and his fanatical Hoa Hao forces have made their way to the capital to restore order and bring the rule of righteousness to the land.

Many within our government believe that allowing these parties to run would endanger our infantile democracy and if given power, they will transform our nation into a theocracy.

vietnam.16.d:0 "Emperor Bao Dai’s decision to align the Imperial Council towards the religious fanatics of the Cao Dai has backfired as the cult’s influence continues to surpass that of the Emperor and his allies. The Caodaists have taken an aggressive stance against our German benefactors and have begun assembling their militia forces to seize control of the state. With time running out, the Emperor has made a deal with Governor Ngo Dinh Diem to deal with the Caodaists. In exchange for being granted the position of Prime Minister, Diem has rallied members of the Catholic minority into a militia to help rout the Caodaist forces. As the Caodaist militia and loyalist forces face off just miles away from the Imperial Palace, it has become clear that..."

vietnam.17.d:0 "With the armies of the would-be dictator Diem utterly crushed by our righteous army, we have achieved a stunning victory. Seeking no further bloodshed, we have allowed the degenerate Bao Dai and his German masters to leave Vietnam forever, leaving Vietnam under our divine guidance. Bringing harmony and unity across our diverse shore is no easy task, and our holy cardinals have brought forth different proposals to secure our rule. The Cuu Trung Dai, or Executive Body, have suggested that we integrate our Caodaist hierarchy into the functions of the state and establish a theological republic that is fit to restore order and bring peace to Vietnam. Some monarchists within the church hierarchy believe that we should instead honor our traditions and restore the monarchy under the exiled Nguyen Prince, Cuong De. Currently residing in Japan, Cuong De has maintained close ties with the Cao Dai and his rule could greatly assist in legitimizing our new government."

They argue that Vietnam cannot truly be free if we continue to cooperate with the Ostasien government. This proposal has garnered the support of many ministers within the VNQDD and the People’s Rule Party. The capitalist moderates within the Indochinese Constitutionalist Party, however, see the opportunities that collaboration with the Germans might provide and instead propose that we stand firm with our allies in Berlin.

On the ballot, the main three parties of our new democratic movement that stand as dominant and fully likely to win are the redeemed Vietnamese Nationalist Party, the new Indochinese Constitutionalist Party, and the infantile People’s Rule Party. The Vietnamese Nationalist Party, also widely known as the VNQDD or Viet Quoc, is a party of Social Democracy that advocates for Vietnamese Nationalism, Market Socialist economics, and Paternalistic Conservative social views. The People’s Rule Party espouses specifically Annamese Nationalism along with a dedication to the ideals of the liberal Enlightenment and Western Capitalist and Modernist ideals all framed in a unique Vietnamese setting. Finally, the Indochinese Constitutionalist Party stands as one of the few political movements in Vietnam still dedicated to the united Indochinese ideal, preaching egalitarian and equal Indochinese unity with Humanistic Capitalism and Populist Agrarianism united by the pursuit of a just society supported by civil rights. Interestingly, or worryingly depending on how you take it, the Vietnamese Democratic Socialist Party of the Hoahaoist zealots and the Peace and Love Party of the Coconut cultists have both also tried to get their name in the running, but unless officially allowed on the ballot, they hold no actually chance of victory. No matter what, only one party can win, and as the votes are counted, the nation counts down the minutes to our new destiny. The party that wins is..."

Formed alongside his brothers such as Ngo Dinh Nhu and Ngo Dinh Khoi, Diem has moved to formally create the Can Lao party which shall serve as the vehicle for his own brand of Personalist ideology. Featuring a hodgepodge ideology fusing Anti-Consumerist Conservative Christian Corporatism with Nationalist and Anti-Socialist ideas, Diem’s thoughtform revolves around the ‘Three Theories’ of Anti-Material Spiritualism, Communitarianism, and Personalism that advocates for the well-being of the community and wider society with an emphasis on each person trying to achieve a prosperous and virtuous self within our united Vietnamese community. By spreading these ideas forcefully and thoroughly throughout the government apparatus and wider Vietnamese society, Diem seeks to bend the entire nation into a shape fitting of his uncompromising vision."

As we bring about this union, many within our movement have raised the idea that if we claim to want to unite all of humanity, then we must actually do it if we are to truly usher in the Third Amnesty, and as such, they advocate for our government to take our war machine on a global tour of forceful proselytization, finally ending human struggle in one final war to end all wars before global peace and love is finally achieved.

Throughout Cochinchina, our garrisons are ambushed by militias loyal to the Hoa Hao, a religious cult operating in the Mekong wetlands. There is no doubt that this chaos has been organized by the nefarious Vietnamese who had betrayed our trust. Seeing no end in sight to constant uprisings and revolts in Vietnam, many within our government have proposed that we return these lands to Vietnam in return to safe passage to our holdings in Laos and Cambodia. Hardliners within our government are calling for a full-scale war against the Vietnamese to restore order to this rebellious colony once and for all."

In their letters they have asked for increased autonomy similar to that of Bao Dai in Vietnam. Reformists within our government believe that granting these local rulers autonomy could help foster further cooperation and preserve our domination over the Pacific. The hardliners and old guard however, are vehemently against any notions of granting any more autonomy, believing that this will only weaken our influence in Southeast Asia."

Diem had promised the Emperor that the insurgency would be quickly dealt with if he were to be appointed as Prime Minister.

However, the Binh Xuyen force itself is far from united or even organized, and now the two leading men of the Force have begun to duke it out in order to determine who shall lead this new Vietnam. Both mob bosses and accomplished kingpins of criminal activity, and both veteran military officers and bandit kings, Bay Vien and Ba Duong differ in a few key areas. While Ba Duong, one of the original founders of the movement, seeks to bring the Binh Xuyen back to their roots as a group of river pirates and non-ideological bandits that steal from the unworthy and give to the poor and themselves, Bay Vien - the young officer who has risen to the ranks to now lead the Binh Xuyen’s largest faction, - has taken a notable ideological slant, being influenced by both Leftist and Rightist ideas of populism and nationalism due to his time working with Indochinese political groups across the ideological spectrum, including the Viet Cong, the Viet Quoc, and the governments of Bao Dai and Ngo Dinh Diem, in the pursuit of personal glory and profit. Though both accomplished mafia bosses and lords of crime, only one can rise to solely lead Binh Xuyen and wider Vietnam into our destined future."

Some nationalists within our administration have argued that Vietnam cannot truly be free if we continue to kowtow to the Kaiser. They argue that we no longer need the Germans and we would be better off on our own. Our German and French ex-colonial allies could stay here all they want, and we shall always do business and party like Bao Dai and Diem have always enjoyed, but these men of ambition wish to bow to foreign titans no longer.

These more mild Socialists prefer certain allowances of market economics while pushing a more traditionalist social order fused with paternalistic conservative and anti-Internationalist ideas on socio-economics and foreign policy.

With our modernization efforts underway, many have called for Vietnam to begin the path of modern Secularism, complete with religious freedoms and free of favoritism. However, many special interest groups and political factions throughout our nation favor their own specific religions, pushing for legislation that benefits their ‘true faith’ over the rest. From colonial-inspired Christians like Bao Dai and Ngo Dinh Diem to the Confucianism and Buddhism supported by much of the conservative aristocracy and citizenry, and even down to the masses that follow a wide menagerie of folk faiths and cults along with the more organized religions, the nation is divided on this issue, but we must decide on a law that suits our needs and ambitions the most."

An occasion for celebration, feasting, pilgrimages, family reunions, giving thanks, remembrance, optimism for the future and more while fireworks are set alight and the dragon dancers perform their winding art down major streets, Tet showcases the biggest celebrations and best parties in all of Vietnam.

However, in the interest of pragmatism and national unity, Hoang Dao’s brother Nhat Linh has convinced our government to seek a more compromising avenue. We shall attempt the impossible, seeking to use the West’s ideas to clean our muddy waters and create a prosperous and free Annam while also keeping certain aspects of Annamese culture and locally unique socio-economic facets that are inherent to our identity so as to keep the populace agreeable to our administration and to stay somewhat true to our roots without being obstructed by the traditionalist hang ups that have held Annam back from true unity and greatness."

The wife of his brother and head of the secret service and special forces Ngo Dinh Nhu, Madame Nhu - real name Tran Le Xuan - may not be Diem’s wife, but she is the most powerful women in Vietnam. Having royal blood linked to Emperor Dong Khanh and her mother’s cousin Bao Dai, Nhu has long been at the top of Vietnamese society, living the highlife and receiving an amazing education which would help her carve a path to the top, and now serving as one of Diem’s closest and most trusted confidants and allies. A devoted Catholic convert after marrying her husband, she shares Diem’s anti-Buddhist views despite her Buddhist upbringing and appreciates his Personalist ideology, but is seen as a moderating force in the nation, often keeping Diem on a level leash. Though rumors abound about their allegedly secret love affair, Diem stands by his reputation and lifestyle as a lifelong bachelor, and Madame Nhu leads alongside him as Vietnam’s unofficial official First Lady with a calculated, charming wit and an iron fist."

Seeking to get on the good side of Rome and the Vatican while pursuing his dream of turning Vietnam into the Catholic bleeding heart of East Asia, Diem, his brothers including our own Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc, and the rest of the party have begun to debate whether to pass a planned slew of anti-Buddhist laws aimed at rapidly diminishing their heretical influence over the state and the masses. However, such laws would likely cause unrest and even bloodshed, so many moderates within our clique stress caution, instead suggesting we merely support Catholic interests behind the scenes.

As a protest against the new anti-flag law broke out near the heart of the city, things took a violent turn when local police forces backed up by members of the ARVN special forces led by Diem’s brother Ngo Dinh Nhu began to fire into the crowd after it became too chaotic to manage, causing a mass stampede a nine protestors were shot and killed in the panic, while dozens other were injured in mayhem that followed. With this just being one of many recent flashpoints of Buddhist on anti-Buddhist violence breaking out in recent weeks, it would seem like things are coming to a head, but Diem has dug in and so far the administration has refused to yield."

A prominent Mahayana Buddhist monk who has been a leading figure in the protests and resistance against the pro-Catholic and violently anti-Buddhist policies of Ngo Dinh Diem’s administration, Thich Quang Duc had resolved to get the world’s attention directed towards Diem’s prejudiced actions by sacrificing his living body in an ultimate showcasing of dedication to a noble and just cause. After months of anti-Buddhist violence and acts being perpetrated by both citizens and the government, the final straw came when flying the Buddhist flag was outlawed this preceding May just days after the nation was pushed to fly the flags of the Vatican by Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc - one of Diem’s brothers - which resulted in a peaceful protest turning into a bloodbath as 9 innocents in the crowd were shot dead by Diem’s men. \n\nEntering Saigon’s city center surrounded by an extravagant procession of over 350 monks and nuns, Quang Duc emerged from a car along with two other monks as one placed a red cushion on the road while the other carried a petrol can. Sitting in the lotus position at the middle of a busy intersection in Saigon across from the German Embassy on this day, June 11th, Thich Quang Duc was doused in gasoline by one of his associates before reciting words of homage to the Amitabha Buddha - ‘Nam mo A Di Da Phat ‘ - while holding his wooden prayer beads. As he chanted, he struck a match and dropped it upon his lap, lighting himself ablaze for all to see as onlookers and reporters watched on in horrified awe, many tipped off by the monks that ‘something important’ would transpire here the day before. His final words were ‘Before closing my eyes and moving towards the Buddha, I respectfully plead to President Ngo Dinh Diem to take a mind of compassion towards the people of the nation and implement religious equality to maintain the strength of the homeland eternally. I call the venerables, reverends, members of the sangha, and the lay buddhists to organize in solidarity to make sacrifices to protect Buddhism.’ \n\nOutcry has poured in from across the world, even throughout the West, as regimes and people across the spectrum pour out their hearts and grieve with the Buddhists of Vietnam, and many nations and organizations have already pledged support and aid to this crisis. In response to this and before Thich Quang Duch was even extinguished, Diem called for his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu and his ARVN forces to sweep across the nation, clearing out Buddhist pagodas and performing purges against the clergy in order to eradicate Buddhist dissidence and to reappropriate their treasures for use by the state for funding, but as pushback against these ideas mount, a change in policy may need to be considered."

Should we yield in the name of stability and peace, and allow religious freedoms once again, while still favoring Catholic ideas in a more discrete manner, ending all anti-Buddhist persecution, or shall we take a different route. We could just push through and keep the laws in place, for the Buddhists cannot last forever, or we could take a compromising option and give the Buddhists token freedom, autonomy in certain areas, and some of their freedoms back in exchange for being virtually second-class citizens, which might just be enough to stop the monk burnings, riots, protests, and other obstacles. However, some of our hardliners and most devout Buddist suggest we simply stand by our beliefs and show them we mean business by keeping the laws in place and stealing the preserved heart of Thich Quang Doc that has become a religious icon and holy relic of a saintly martyr. What shall we do?"

Claiming that Diem has Marxist tendencies, largely due to the 'revolutionary' rhetoric of the Can Lao Party (called the Personalist Labor Revolutionary Party in English) and due to Diem's allowance of rural collectivization and unionization of rural/agrarian workers along with some forms of populism, these paranoid nutjobs fear that Diem and his brothers will one day turn Vietnam into some sort of Market Socialist or Synarcho-Communist hellscape united by the foreign Catholic faith. However, most anyone with a brain has rejected these ridiculous claims as nothing more than the ravings of a madman, but some still hold onto these supposedly-secret truths, waiting for the day 'Comrade Diem' proclaims the People’s Republic of Vietnam."

Settling temporarily into Saigon, they were originally meant to work with their contact Jacques Cousteu - a former French naval intelligence officer, engineer, inventor, expert diver, aspiring documentarian, and fellow marine biologist who has long corresponded with Ricketts on their shared craft - who they would work with to study and record the local sea life of Vietnam’s lucious coasts while also documenting culture and diverse niche religions of Vietnam and the effect the recent Indochinese Revolution had on this newly independent nation. However, as they toiled to expose the inner beauty of our beloved homeland, their work slowly began to take a back seat to more esoteric pursuits as time went on. \n\nRecently Ricketts and Steinbeck, who have long shared and pursued an interest in the philosophical, metaphysical, mystic, and spiritual, have fallen in with the monk Nguyen Thanh Nam - more commonly called Ong Dao Dua or the Coconut Monk - and his cult that fuses Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianity along with a dedication to ideas of pacifism, egalitarian unity and loving cooperation between all humanity under his faith, and the consumption of coconuts and coconut-based foodstuffs in their entirety in a form of purified and ascetic vegetarianism utilizing a local source of food said to have health and spiritual benefits, hence the name of the religion. Now, these two Americans and their French associate live alongside the monk in a minimalist state as some of his closest students, practicing and preaching their ideas from Ong Dao Dua’s compound and monastery on Phoenix Island, floating atop the Mekong Delta on a mass of wooden piers, and serving as a source of Socialist influence within the cult.

One such veteran is naval officer and German Prince of Hohenzollern-Emden, Franz Joseph Maria Ludwig Anton Thassilo, who served in the Kaiserliche Marine across the Indian and Pacific oceans during the Great War, and later in the nautical administration of Geramn East Asia. Being a devout Catholic while holding an interest in East Asian theology and philosophy built up over his time in the service initially led him to find great interest among the Catholic Church of Vietnam that was established by the former French colonial regime. However, over time his interests spread to more folk and fringe sects such as the Cao Dai faith, due to its deep connection with Catholicism, and the 'Order of the Sun' solar cult of cocoivorist fruitaraians created by the late German vitalist and veteran August Engelhardt, whom the prince studied under before Engelhardt died due to malnutrition and illness brought on by his own strange diet, but the prince did not stop there. \n\nNow, Prince Franz Joseph, has fallen in with the monk Nguyen Thanh Nam - more commonly called Ong Dao Dua or the Coconut Monk - and his cult that fuses Taoism, Buddhism, and Catholic-based Christian thought along with a dedication to ideas of pacifism, egalitarian unity and loving cooperation between all humanity under his faith, and the consumption of coconuts and coconut-based foodstuffs in their entirety in a form of purified and ascetic vegetarianism utilizing a local source of food said to have health and spiritual benefits, hence the name of the religion.

Inviting fellow fringe esoterics, theological leaders, spiritualists, philosophers and more, our conference promised to preach peaceful enlightenment to all in attendance, sweetening the deal with lavish gifts and treasures from our land.

Though many turned abrasive over the mass at first, by the end of the conference most had become enamored by His Coconutship’s words, pledging aid and cooperation, or at least recognition, of the Coconut Faith as a new legitimate religion of the Far East doings its best to bring world peace.

Until the entire nation accepts our one and true faith, this reality shall stand, but whether this is truly the will of the Living Buddha, or just the sad reality forced to be due to Ba Cut’s power and unstoppable dominance is not known."

vietnam.77.d:0 "A failed candidate for the Caodaist clergy, Huynh Phu So was rejected so that he may discover the true faith of Hoa Hao, or ‘Peace and Plenty’. A syncretic folk religion fusing Buddhism, Confucianism, ancestor worship, animism, the White Lotus faith and local Vietnamese folk faiths, Hoa Hao calls for the creation of a theocratic society with no hierarchies, no classist clergy, and no centralized center of faith, instead operating on a semi-anarchist basis with no monastic order, emphasized home practice, and the refusal of elaborate temples and monasteries, all under the founder Huynh Phu So and kept in line by his lead general Ba Cut - aka Le Quang Vinh the Second-born son and immortal war-drunk avatar of war, who leads the Hoa Hao’s vicious and questionably pious militia. However, the core of this militia and Huynh Phu So’s personal bodyguard is a cadre of highly disciplined and zealous warrior nuns, each a woman wholly dedicated to the Hoa Hao faith and willing to give her life to protect Living Buddha and Saint Huynh Phu So. Preaching that each and every human and can learn to commune with the Buddha and reach eventual enlightenment through his living avatar our Master, Hoa Hao is a polar opposite to the complicated and bureaucratic Caodaist faith and the non-violent Coconut faith, but contains aspects of each of them that all Vietnamese folk faiths seem to share. By this one true faith, Vietnam shall be saved, and now we just have to spread this truth to the masses."

As a reward for their aid, we have created a theocratic welfare economy inspired by prominent Socialist figures within Vietnam in order to provide for and uplift the faithful and the pious. With this wide support, we are free to pursue our wider plans without obstacles, and the people are thanked for their aid in pursuing this dream each and every day, and for those still reluctant or resistant, Ba Cut and his militia are always at the ready and on the hunt."

Though Ba Cut has stayed loyal for now, some whisper that he seeks to subvert Huynh Phu So, sidelining the Living Buddha to a position of only spiritual and religious power while Ba Cut would effectively rule the rest of the nation as a nationalist warlord-dictator preaching the Hoa Hao faith. If this shall come to pass however, remains to be seen, but the all-female bodyguard of the Living Buddha remains ever vigilant of his safety."

vietnam.80.t:0 "Cao Dai Cosmology"
vietnam.80.d:0 "Heaven consists of 36 planes, each divided into multiple heavenly realms such as the Realm of Saints, the Realm of the Holy Mother, the Realm of the Perfect Beings, the Realm of the Divine Being, the Divine Court Realm, the Paradise of Extreme Joy, Nirvana, and so on, each accommodating a different interpretation of paradise. Meanwhile, Hell has 10 key realms, each dedicated to carrying our specific punishments against specific souls based on their sin or sins. As souls live their lives and are reborn in a cycle based around the Chinese yin and yang (am and duong in Vietnamese) concept of duality and harmonious balance, they must cultivate virtue and/or devote themselves to spiritual causes in order to reach heaven. Souls only dedicated to the former cannot escape the cycle of life and death and rebirth to fuse with the universe like in Buddhism, and instead can improve their position in the universe among not only the 36 realms, but the 72 planets (of which Earth is the 68th), the 3,000 worlds, and the four great cosmic regions.\n\nThis is the way of the universe, the truth told to us by the Highest Lord Cao Dai and the Dieu Tri Kim Mau, or Duc Phat Mau - our Holy Buddha Mother. These two chief deities embody the ying and the yang, and serve as the two true creators of the universe and all life that spawned from the great nothingness at the beginning of time that was the Dao. These truths, whispered into humanity’s ear since the dawn of our creation by Cao Dai himself, must be taught to the nation at large. All must accept this creed as not only the state religion, but the only religion, for we shall unite humanity by this truth alone."

vietnam.81.d:0 "God the creator and father Cao Dai has communed with men since the dawn of our creation, and our time on his Earth the 68th planet can be divided into three ages of revelation. In the first two ages, Cao Dai spread his will through figures like Dipankara Buddha, Fu Xi, Gautama Buddha, Laozi, Confucius, and Jesus along with all the early minor sages and shamans of man’s earliest faiths. These titans spread their teachings and formed their religions, but over time, each and every single one of their faiths fell to the corruptive influence of mankind and their innate cultural prejudices. The third age is the age of the Caodaist faith here in Vietnam, where we shall move past the innate ethnic and cultural divides in humanity, uniting all of mankind in an open and cohesive shared faith. \n\nLinked to this idea is our main symbol of the Divine Eye, of which there are 50 total that come in five main shapes, each carrying a different meaning and spiritual significance, but their numerology all relates to the cohesive of the world’s various faiths following the Cao Dai doctrine of All Faiths are One. Under the Divine Eye of Cao Dai - the symbol of our faith representing his ever-watchful gaze and guidance of humanity while his other 49 divine eyes continue his other innumerable works - we shall work to make a paradise open to all faiths, cultures, ethnicities, identities, and beyond, so long as they take part in our cohesive and undeniably true faith."

Among those ranks are the various spirits of normal humans, matters, plants, animals, and our ancestors - all able to evolve and climb the universal hierarchy to reach higher planes of existence. Quan Am is regarded as the best Buddha, Li Bai the same for the Immortals, and Guan Yu for the saints, but it is our other saints that usually get more attention. \n\nThese more notorious saints of our faith include Victor Hugo, Sun Yat-sen, the Vietnamese Nostradamus Trang Trinh, Joan of Arc, Muhammad, Moses, Louis Pasteur, Vladmir Lenin, and William Shakespeare to name just a few, with rumors that other prominent contemporary figures like Dorothy Day and Kaiser Karl were considered saints of the faith, though this was likely due to false and sloppy reporting in the West due to them still being alive. Regardless, under this diverse array of Saints, respected figures, and other divine spirits, our society shall attract people across the political aisle and across the wider world, so we must build a paradise here to ensure they come and stay."

vietnam.83.t:0 "Fundamental Laws of the Cao Dai"
vietnam.83.d:0 "All Religions are One. This is the truth of Cao Dai, and is supported by five points of view fundamental to our faith as law. From a moral point of view, all people have a duty to themselves, their family, their broader family that is society, and towards humanity itself, in that order. Frin a philosophical point of view, ascetic lifestyles and anti-materialism free of honors, riches, and luxury is a must and will bring deliverance. From a point of view based on worship, the adoration of God, veneration of divine beings, and the worship of the ancestors are all mandatory. From a spiritual viewpoint, our faith confirms total pan-religious harmony, the existence of spirits and the soul, their survival beyond the physical body, and the process of reincarnation according to Kharmic law. Finally, from the initiates point of view, the faith communicates itself to those Cao Dai the Creator deems worthy through spiritual evolution so that we may all reach the ecstasies of pure happiness. \n\nWith all these rules, things are documented extensively by we Caodaists, even having our own constitution written by former Ho Phap, or Defender of the Doctrine, and now current Giao-Tong (High Pope) Pham Cong Tac called the Phan-Chanh-Truyen that documents divine messages from Cao Dai and Mother Buddha while also serving as a guidebook for the faith and a record of the will of the Founders of the Five Religions (Shakyamuni, Lao Tze, Confucius, Jesus Christ, and Jiang Ziya) and the founders and teachers of Caodaism. The faith and these rules are organized in a 9-rank hierarchy that starts with the highest pope - the Giao-Tong - and goes down through three censor cardinals, three cardinals, 36 archbishops, 72 bishops, 3,000 priests, and then unlimited numbers of student priests, subdignitaries, and followers filling out the bottom three ranks, all divided into the yellow Buddhist branch, the blue Taoist branch, and the red Confucianist branch, coming together to form the full Holy See centered in the Holy See compound in Tay Ninh city. \n\nThough complex, this hierarchy functions as a bureaucracy not only for the religion, but for the state now too, and with its rigid organization and anti-corruption stance bolstered with fanatically piety, we have created an efficient bureaucracy and effective theocratic administration."

vietnam.84.t:0 "Cao Dai Worship Rituals"
vietnam.84.d:0 "There are four daily ceremonies in a traditional Caodaist day, that is, at 06:00, Midday, 18:00, and midnight, either at the local temple or in front of the home altar. Monthly rituals take place at midnight on the 1st and 15th days of the lunar month. There is also a special anniversary ceremony once a year for God the Father, the Holy Mother, the five founders of the world's major religions, and the founders of the Cao Dai religion. The rituals differ between places however, depending on who they pray to and the time of year. \n\nFor example, at the Holy See in Tay Ninh, prayers include incense offerings, ceremony openings, prayer to the Jade Emperor (God the Father), prayer to Dipankara Buddha of Buddhism, prayer to Thái Thuong Lão Quân or Taishang Laojun of Taoism, and prayer to Confucius, as well as to one of the three jewel offering prayers of flower, wine, or tea, and finally the five pledges. At the Holy Mother temple however, prayers include incense offering, ceremony opening, prayer describing the role of the Holy Mother, prayer to express gratitude to the Holy Mother, one of the three jewels offering prayers, and the five pledges instead. There are also differences between monthly rituals, and anniversary ones. \n\nCeremonial prescriptions such as actions, dress and music are organized in detail by God the Father. These include ceremonies for initiations, marriages and funerals. Particular attention is paid to death, and it has been revealed to the religion how the soul journeys towards heaven and how, on earth, co-religionists can pray for souls to help them on their way. These specific rituals may be complex, but they are needed to fulfill the religious truths revealed to us as God’s true chosen."

From former colonials themselves to people like the Nguyen dynasty and Vietnam’s collaborative nobility to elitists and politicians that worked in their oppressive administrations, all must be brought to justice and before a court of law. Any that give themselves up shall be given a fair trial and be offered exile over life in prison or execution, but any that refuse to come quietly shall have the everything we can muster dropped upon them.

However, when most Leftists were forced into hiding and when Bao Dai and many others turned to the new German colonials with open arms, Cuong De was left alone, turning to Japan and later the Caodaists for help. With these old contacts in mind, and with many of them still alive, it has been proposed that we work with our old anarchist, syndicalist, and communist allies that shared our nationalist and Pan-Asian vision in order to uplift the masses beneath the great Emperor Cuong De.

Calling on theologians and spiritual leaders from across the world from East to West to come to our main compound to learn our ways, our monks sent out the call to all we could contact. However, the result has been less unanimous and widely beloved as we initially hoped. \n\nMost of the West has ignored our call, while the East has had more success, with figures like the Dalai Lama, Bogd Gegen, Mohandas Gandhi, and heads of other East Asian faiths like Korean shamanism, the White Faith and other Sibero-Steppe folk faiths, Tengri, Japanese Shinto, Oomoto, and a few others in attendance in some form, either coming themselves or sending respectful emissaries in their stead. Most Western faiths however have only sent token delegations or less, with even the Pope in Rome sending naught but a wax-sealed note clearly written by some other hands stating His Holiness was too busy to attend and Italy too strained to spare a delegation or gift - clearly a snub to our faith and a denigration of our legitimacy as a partially-Catholic faith. \n\nDespite these minor setbacks, the conference went along well enough after that, though it was obvious that most if not in attendance did not truly take what our faith had to offer, with all denying to put any serious effort into our dream of a united humanity under one cohesive faith, and with most not even being kind enough to politely humor the notion as delegation after delegation left during the course of main speech. We cannot let his stumble turn into a fall however, for we have made a few allies across East Asia, at least in name only.

We could go with Duy Tan, raised by the French and sharing the same French allies and inspirations as Pham Quynh. Alternatively, the fringe Nguyen dynasty member Cuong De could work; a Pan-Asian nationalist and former independence revolutionary supported by Chinese figures like warlord Duan Qirui, Sun Yat-sen’s KMT, republican Liang Qichao, and now even by Japanese Pan-Asians like Inukai Tsuyoshi, Ikki Kita, and Shumei Okawa, with many allies across Asia but we have concerns over his strange ties to the Caodaists. Finally, there is Thanh Thai, considered by many to be the true emperor of Annam after he was wrongfully declared insane and taken off the throne by the French in 1907 to crush his plan and to jail him for attempting to free Annam from colonial rule by working with the Qing and other traditionalist Chinese factions.

vietnam.100.d:0 "The coronation of a new emperor is seldom a small or quiet affair, but the coronation of Cuong De as the new Emperor of Vietnam has strived to create a new standard for regal ostentatiousness as one of the most elaborate and expensive modern coronations in Asia takes place in the old capital of Hue. With Cuong De adorned in a most lavish and extravagant outfit fusing traditional Vietnamese noble designs with the iconography of the Hoa Hao faith, the hall within the Imperial City of Hue the ceremony was being held in was the only thing decorated more beautifully than the Emperor’s own clothes. With decorations of gold, jade, pearl, and more, lavish seating areas complete with lucious furs and tapestries, and with art and Hoa Hao idolatry adoring the temple from end to end, the coronation’s setting would be fit for the Living Buddha himself, let alone a mortal emperor. Perhaps more interesting than the decor was the massive list of those guests in attendance, for not only was the soon-to-be Emperor’s large extended family, cadre of allies and confidants, and the entire Vietnamese nobility invited, for Cuong De called for guests both across Vietnam and across wider Asia to be in attendance for his ascension. \n\nFrom prominent and regal figures among Asia’s many monarchies and nobilities such as members of the Namgyal, Wangchuck, Aisin-Gioro, Yamato, Khun Lo, and Norodom dynasties as well as the Duke Yansheng, the Marquis of Extended Grace, the Celestial Master and Living Buddha Zhang Enpu, the Bogd Gegen of Mongolia, and the Dalai Lama of Tibet to name a few, along with many other lesser rulers - particularly from India and wider Asia’s large assortment of lesser royalty. Additionally prominent Pan-Asian authors, movements, and thinkers that have conversed with Cuong De or support his Pan-Asian ideas, such as Shumei Okawa, Ikki Kita, Ryohei Uchida, Hayashi Fusao, Li Dazhao, Ram Manohar Lohia, Lee Kuan Yew, Sun Fo, Zhang Jinghui, Nicholas Roerich and his family, representatives of the famed Mongolian freedom fighter Gada Meiren, the wider Black Dragon Society’s leaders, the leading members of the Dark Ocean Society, and many more, have arrived to offer their best blessings to the newest face of the Pan-Asian struggle. Also paying their respects are the influential leaders and figures of Vietnam’s largest religions, such as the heads of the Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, and event Coconut faiths, though interestingly, the Catholic clergy of Vietnam - called colonial puppets of France by Cuong De himself - have been barred from attending the ceremony despite the Hoa Hao’s own Christian influences and sympathies. Overall, the coronation was an extravagant, almost otherworldly affair whose grandiosity and splendor only marks the beginning of how high this new Emperor and his Vietnam shall aim for."

vietnam.101.t:0 "Election Day in Vietnam"
vietnam.101.d:0 "Now that our democracy has been established, it's time for a new election by calling on our citizens to vote. On the ballot, the main three parties of our new democratic movement that stand as dominant and fully likely to win are the redeemed Vietnamese Nationalist Party, the new Indochinese Constitutionalist Party, and the infantile People’s Rule Party. The Vietnamese Nationalist Party, also widely known as the VNQDD or Viet Quoc, is a party of Social Democracy that advocates for Vietnamese Nationalism, Market Socialist economics, and Paternalistic Conservative social views. The People’s Rule Party espouses specifically Annamese Nationalism along with a dedication to the ideals of the liberal Enlightenment and Western Capitalist and Modernist ideals all framed in a unique Vietnamese setting. Finally, the Indochinese Constitutionalist Party stands as one of the few political movements in Vietnam still dedicated to the united Indochinese ideal, preaching egalitarian and equal Indochinese unity with Humanistic Capitalism and Populist Agrarianism united by the pursuit of a just society supported by civil rights. No matter what, only one party can win, and as the votes are counted, the nation counts down the minutes to our new destiny. The party that wins is..."

vietnam.102.t:0 "A New Liberal Force"
vietnam.102.d:0 "With our swift transition to a true democratic mandate, parties new and old have emerged to contest in the upcoming elections. Amongst these emerging political forces, one party stands out in particular: The People's Rule Party of Great Viet, or Dai Viet Dan chinh Dang. Formed amidst frustrations of former progressive revolutionaries disillusioned with socialist radicalism and the rightist reactionaries alike, the party’s aim is to bring about their vision of anti-traditionalist Liberal-Socialist revolution guided by the Enlightenment similar to the French Parti Radical, and particularly the Enlightened Conservative ideals of François Guizot, while still adapting to the realities of the nation. Led by the core of the Self-Reliant Literary Association with its leader being the popular modernist writer Nguyen Tuong Tam, the party appeals to a wide base of formerly revolutionary workers and peasants, which has garnered them generous support against the discredited Vietnamese Nationalist Party and the gentry-bourgeois dominated Indochinese Constitutional Party, although it is unclear whether this upstart party can defy the legendary status of the older, more experienced political forces and secure their leadership of the nation."

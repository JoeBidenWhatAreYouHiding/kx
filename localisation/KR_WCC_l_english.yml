### Parties ###
WCC_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
WCC_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America (Vanguardist) - The military has identified a faction of the SPA, which they call the "Vanguardists", as one of the most threatening groups to the stability of the WCC. These hardliners want to drastically change society and the economy as well. Luckily, they are few and far between in the arid deserts, harsh plains, and towering mountains under our control. For now, it will suffice to stay vigilant."
WCC_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
WCC_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America (IWW) - The IWW has infiltrated our territory, and seems to be focusing on the small cities of the region, such as Phoenix, Boise, and Denver. Though we have been able to keep them relatively muted, we should make sure we maintain control of our urban centers, for losing those could spell disaster for our war effort."
WCC_radical_socialist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
WCC_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America (Mutualist) - The more moderate members of the SPA draw influence from both the so-called Nationalists in the CSA and Upton Sinclair's Commonwealth Party in the West. From the intel we can gather, it seems that their message is uniquely tailored to our region, typically with overtures to farmers and cattle ranchers. Their criticism of railroad companies and eastern banks could easily catch on in our rural areas, so we should do all we can to reassure our people that we represent their interests. A farmer's revolt could topple our regime..."
WCC_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
WCC_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party - The Progressives in our territory support most of the same policies that Progressives elsewhere support; a social safety net, increased regulations against big business, and temperance. They lack the necessary qualities to keep stability in our vast territory, so for now, they are a party that we should keep an eye on. They are unlikely to cause trouble anytime soon, but if their fellow Progressives gain traction elsewhere, it is hard to say what could occur."
WCC_social_liberal_party:0 "Democratic Party"
WCC_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party (Reformist) - Reform-minded Democrats are a small faction in the territory we control, but they do exist. They typically support greater education funding, social security, and some labor-friendly legislation. Our intelligence doesn't view this faction as one that will be particularly threatening, especially given their own divisions within the Democratic Party. However, if their Western allies, the Democratic-Republicans, gain power, it may embolden them to join their cause instead."
WCC_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
WCC_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party - The laissez-faire Republicans of the West are used to being in power, but this is obviously not the case anymore. As such, they might get the idea that they can have influence in our government, but we must maintain military rule. In the meantime, we should focus on overtures to supporters of this party, reminding them that we wish to return America to its old democracy. For the duration of the war, their policies cannot be implemented, but it would not be a bad idea to incorporate some of their policies into our own plans."
WCC_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
WCC_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party (Conservatives) - The Democratic Party has traditionally contested the West with the Republicans, but has typically been the weaker of the two in the area. However, former President Woodrow Wilson was fairly popular in the region for his support of non-intervention in the Weltkrieg, and this has kept the Democratic Party competitive in the region ever since. Now, facing a split, they are not as threatening as they might otherwise be, but we should take care to cultivate good relations with Democratic officials in our area. They could help to reassure our people and make sure they stay firmly under the control of the military. Perhaps we could even adopt some of their policies after the war, if they are cooperative."
WCC_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "Western Federalists"
WCC_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Western Federalist Faction - Western Federalists are the main faction of the military that has been given jurisdiction over the Western states. Led primarily by Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower, they are loyal to the United States, and ostensibly to MacArthur as well. For now, this alignment has been cemented, but there is certainly a potential for conflict should the USA prevail in the Civil War. Eisenhower is no fan of MacArthur, and Bradley's intentions are unclear. Should MacArthur decide to snub the leaders of the WCC after the war, and take sole power for himself, it is not outside the realm of imagination that further conflict would follow..."
WCC_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Federalist Loyalist Faction"
WCC_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Federalist Loyalist Faction (Hardliners) - This faction of the government is made up of those who support MacArthur as well as the USA, and will follow his orders in any circumstance. These Hardliners are known to get into bitter arguments with the ruling faction of the WCC about how to implement MacArthur's orders and whether his commands should be followed without question. Should MacArthur decide to flee to the WCC, these supporters will welcome him with open arms."
WCC_national_populist_party:0 "NDWL"
WCC_national_populist_party_long:0 "National Democratic White League - The NDWL, while not as powerful here as in the East, still holds influence in our territory. Our inteligence officials report that they have used anti-Chinese sentiments to rile up support, and this could make them dangerous. We should suppress the NDWL and its offshoots to ensure that we are not outflanked by racial appeals. Our position could depend on this effort."

WCC_MAC_PARTY:0 "MacArthur Loyalists"
WCC_MAC_PARTY_long:0 "MacArthur Loyalists - Douglas MacArthur has fled the East, bringing his most fervent supporters with him. His experiences in the East have changed him somewhat, and he now rails against revolutionaries and reactionaries alike, promising to eradicate traitors to the United States once and for all. To do this, he hopes to use aggressive tactics that put our more numerous enemies on the backfoot. He is also suspicious of citizens within our own territory, and promises to watch them closely. Most of all, MacArthur's now-famous proclamation that "I Shall Return" has endeared him to our soldiers, and they support him without question. The only thing that stands between MacArthur and this goal now are armies of angry radicals trying to tear the nation apart. For his part, MacArthur couldn't think of a better way to use our ammunition."

WCC_rebuild_americas_industry_desc:0 "America's exports have fallen during the depression despite taking a laissez-faire position on trade laws.

WCC_trial_of_american_companies_desc:0 "It is time for Congress to hear the testimony of the rebellious companies.

This would allow the government to prosecute individual shareholders as responsible for decisions made."
WCC_esmwt:0 "Fate of the Unions"

WCC_american_industry:0 "American Industrial Might"
WCC_american_industry_desc:0 "The war may have temporarily reinvigorated heavy industry, but its design was temporary and facilities were essentially built on top of closed factories. We must bring our safety and management efficiencies to bear in order to make this upswing permanent."
WCC_rebuild_agriculture:0 "Rebuild Agricultural Industry"
WCC_rebuild_agriculture_desc:0 "In order to transport and process the food to feed our nation, we must encourage innovative preservation and agronomy sciences. Congress has set up a fund to investigate this and several politicians have contributed to it directly."

WCC_aviation_industry_desc:0 "The United States used to lead the world in civilian aircraft manufacturing. Now assembly line systems in Germany have us outpaced.

WCC_scrap_what_we_can:0 "Scrap What We Can"
WCC_scrap_what_we_can_desc:0 "We don't have much in our barren lands. But, what can we find? An armaments factory here, a private airplane there. We should scrap together, and convert, everything we possibly can. Let nothing be spared in this war effort."
WCC_fortify_the_rockies:0 "Fortify the Rockies"
WCC_fortify_the_rockies_desc:0 "We are blessed with a significant geographical advantage: the Rockies. These mountains will shield us from our foes in the West or East, depending on which side we focus on first, and will bide us crucial time. Further, there is the possibility we could bleed our more numerous foes fighting over these mountains..."
WCC_protect_the_skies:0 "Protect the Blue Skies"
WCC_protect_the_skies_desc:0 "The sky on the plain is vast, open, and blue as far as the eye can see. We should never have it blocked out by enemy aircraft. If we want to avoid that, we need to invest in anti-air equipment and technology, so that we can shoot any enemy out of the sky. The sky is blue now, and it will remain that way."
WCC_build_what_we_can:0 "Build What We Can"
WCC_build_what_we_can_desc:0 "We can scrap together everything in this great land and we still wouldn't have enough. We should also try to build new equipment and factories, so that we can stand a chance against our better equipped enemies. This will require hard work on the part of our men and women, but we have no doubt that they will rise to the task."
WCC_native_appeals:0 "Native Appeals"
WCC_native_appeals_desc:0 "It has come to this. Yes, we have to reach out to Mormons if we want to win the war. No, we are not converting to Mormonism. But, they are a significant part of our population, and we should treat them as such. Let us appeal to this group and make sure they are just as committed to our war effort as anyone else."
WCC_civilian_relocation:0 "Civilian Relocation"

WCC_to_the_last_man_desc:0 "If we want to win this war, we can't afford to let the enemy outnumber and outfight us. We will fight to the last man, or we may as well not fight at all. Rally to the flag men, and tomorrow, we shall retake our country!"
WCC_washingtonian_tactics:0 "Washingtonian Tactics"
WCC_washingtonian_tactics_desc:0 "As a relatively small force next to our enemies we have much to learn from Washingtonian tactics during the Revolutionary War. Appeals to his hit-and-run tactics alongside using disinformation is not only practical but inspiring to our mens morale."
WCC_counter_propaganda:0 "Counter-Propaganda"
WCC_counter_propaganda_desc:0 "With our opponents being so ideological in nature, we need to counter their ideological tactics with our own. Counter-Propaganda will focus on debunking their claims while reminding citizens of their duty to America, the legitimate government and military, and aim to go beyond our borders into enemy territory to weaken their stance while strengthening our own."
WCC_the_colorado:0 "Our Friend, The Colorado"
WCC_the_colorado_desc:0 "We must to use the natural defenses of our region to our advantage which, combined with our superior training, will create an insurmountable barrier for our enemies to overcome while allowing them to lose their edge in manpower and for our forces to move more quickly amongst each other."
WCC_recruit_as_we_go:0 "Recruiting As We Go"
WCC_recruit_as_we_go_desc:0 "As we expand into enemy territory which, in reality, is our American territory, we need to recruit locals into our army as professional soldiers, not militias. This will allow us build from our originally sparse territory and create a wave that will retake the whole nation."
WCC_vegas_revenue:0 "Vegas Revenue"
WCC_vegas_revenue_desc:0 "The military towns of Reno and Vegas have become rather profitable in their gambling and related operations. It appears the government could invest in these growing businesses and their nearby infrastructure, and use the profits to fund its various war efforts."
WCC_war_bonds:0 "Loyalist Bonds"
WCC_war_bonds_desc:0 "Bonds would go a far way in giving us much needed liquid funds for our war efforts while giving an opportunity to raise support for the cause. So buy your Liberty Bonds today citizen!"
WCC_copper:0 "Copper, Copper and Copper"
WCC_copper_desc:0 "While we may not have many resources on our bases, one exception is the copper available in Arizonia and Montana. Mining it through a newly created government corporation will bring us much needed resources."

WCC_fate_of_marshall:0 "Marshall's Soldiers"
WCC_fate_of_marshall_desc:0 "George Marshall was a mentor to many of our generals. They fought not for extremism, but for what they believed was the United States of America. Though they were wrong, we cannot fault them for having good intentions. Let us not forget though-the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
WCC_fate_of_macarthur:0 "MacArthur's Men"
WCC_fate_of_macarthur_desc:0 "The would-be tyrant MacArthur has lost the war, and now the time has come to decide what to do with his forces. While some may remain loyal to him, it's very likely they can be converted to our cause."
WCC_patton:0 "Patton's Boys"
WCC_patton_desc:0 "George S. Patton was part of the reactionary faction that rose up in the South during the Civil War. His cause was admirable, but they betrayed our country, and we must make sure they do not rise up again. To accomplish this, we will instill a sense of nationalism amongst the men who were once Patton's Boys, so that they will fight just as hard for the United States of America as they did for their own cause."
WCC_vet_affairs:0 "Veteran Administration Bureau"
WCC_vet_affairs_desc:0 "A state that depends so heavily on its military must take care of its soldiers when they come home. Veterans will be a large group of our people now, and many of them did not fight for us. Let us create the Veteran Administration Bureau, so that we can win veterans of all sides over to our side. Perhaps we can win their favor and, if we need them again someday, they will heed the call."
WCC_wfc:0 "War Finance Corporation"
WCC_wfc_desc:0 "Our top officials have advised us to create a "War Finance Corporation". This government-run corporation would give support to industries that are crucial for our war effort. It will also fund the banks that aid these industries. By creating this corporation, we can have more equipment than ever, and our war effort will last much longer than it would have otherwise."
WCC_ami:0 "Defense Logistics Agency"
WCC_ami_desc:0 "Our soldiers can fight, but our army needs to keep up with them. We need to get the munitions and supplies our factories produce to our men, and we need to get oil to our vehicles. To coordinate all this, we will create a new agency. The Defense Logistics Agency will make it possible to fight a two-front war on a large front if need be. Our logistics shall never fail us!"
WCC_pension_subsidies:0 "Pension Subsidies"
WCC_pension_subsidies_desc:0 "We could still do a better job of taking care of our veterans. Let us create nursing homes and other types of care for our elderly veterans, so that our soldiers know who we work for. We will also subsidize these veterans and help them live respectable lives in their waning days."
WCC_bureaucratic_justice:0 "Bureaucratic Justice"
WCC_bureaucratic_justice_desc:0 "Our government must do something to replace the old justice system of our country. Instead of assuming someone is innocent until proven guilty, would it not be more efficient to presume their guilt and put the onus on the defendant? This would allow us to resolve cases faster, and perhaps allow us to get rid of some of our enemies as well..."
WCC_entente_relations:0 "Entente Relations"
WCC_entente_relations_desc:0 "Canada, along with the rest of the Entente, has assisted us in various ways during the Second Civil War. We should pursue closer relations with them, as they are our natural ideological allies. They understand our concentration on our military, as well as our fundamental principles, better than any other nation. They are also our neighbors. If we must co-exist, let us be allies."
WCC_containment:0 "Containment"
WCC_containment_desc:0 "Our foreign policy advisors have developed a doctrine to combat the rise of syndicalism in the Western Hemisphere. This may also hamper the growth of left wing movements here as well. The doctrine will be called "Containment", and we will give aid to countries in danger of falling to left wing radicals, as well as work to cause tension within nations that have already fallen. Let America show her might on the world stage."

WCC_the_fourth_branch:0 "Fourth Branch of Government"
WCC_the_fourth_branch_desc:0 "Some of our people have talked about a fourth branch of government for years. Now, there really will be a fourth branch. The military will be one of the main institutions of our government, and it will be as much of a pillar of it as the others are. Before long, it will likely be the only branch. Our people will never be unsafe again."
WCC_republican_traditions:0 "Republican Traditions"
WCC_republican_traditions_desc:0 "Our country was a republic since its inception. Things have changed since those days, but we will still retain many of our old republican traditions.

WCC_the_wise_men:0 "The Wise Men"
WCC_the_wise_men_desc: "With military officials in charge of our country, we can run things far more efficiently. The military will receive the attention it needs, and it will be larger and better funded than ever before. Our "Wise Men" sit at the top of it all and direct our men like pieces on a chess board. America will be a warrior society, more than Sparta, Rome, or Germany ever were."
WCC_think_tanks:0 "Think Tanks"
WCC_think_tanks_desc:0 "There have been many political think tanks in our country in past decades, and this has inspired us to create think tanks for the military as well. These think tanks will serve as the foremost research institutions in North America for military technology and strategy. We will be one of the most advanced armies in the world, and one day we shall even outmatch the Germans."
WCC_institute_for_advanced_study:0 "Institute for Advanced Study"
WCC_institute_for_advanced_study_desc:0 "We will create a hub for further research within our nation, so that our military can become the dominant force in our hemisphere and perhaps the world.

WCC_american_finance_corporation:0 "Bank for Reconstruction and Development"
WCC_american_finance_corporation_desc:0 "Many of our areas are still devastated by the war. One idea to help reconstruction efforts is to create the B.R.D., which will give loans to the most devastated areas of our country. This will help them rebuild and recover from the conflict. We will also give loans to developping areas and states, so that they can become more prosperous than ever before."
WCC_restore_wall_street:0 "Restore Wall Street"
WCC_restore_wall_street_desc:0 "Before the Civil War, Wall Street was an important financial institution in our country. We should restore it, so that New York can become a global economic hub once again.

WCC_i_shall_return_desc:0 "MacArthur has come to us beaten and bloodied. But, he is not broken. In fact, his resolve has never been stronger. Despite that, he has come to us a changed man. Wildly decrying revolutionaries and reactionaries, he speaks of our American identity, rallying our people to massacre those who have betrayed our country. Though we don't have much, we will use what we have to beat the traitors once and for all."
WCC_intensive_training:0 "Intensive Training"
WCC_intensive_training_desc:0 "One lesson MacArthur has taken away from his time in the East is that our soldiers need more training. He now insists we train them as much as humanly possible and push them to new levels, so that they will be unmatched in the battlefield. He will not be beaten twice."
WCC_advanced_security_forces:0 "Advanced Security Forces"
WCC_advanced_security_forces_desc:0 "Since MacArthur has arrived, it has been clear to everyone that he has become a very paranoid man. He is paranoid for good reason, though, given the state of our country. He demands the creation of new American security forces, specializing in special operations, in order to carry out any tasks he sees fit to bring order back to America. Some have whispered about the creation of a secret police force, but those dissenters are quickly silenced."
WCC_civilian_takeover:0 "Civilian Contributions"
WCC_civilian_takeover_desc:0 "Though MacArthur is humble enough to admit his own faults, he also blames the American people for not being committed enough to the war effort.

We will utilize quick, silent strikes and disappear before the enemy even has a chance to react."
WCC_central_bureau:0 "Central Bureau"
WCC_central_bureau_desc:0 "At MacArthur's request, we have created a new "Central Bureau" to assist us in managing military affiars.

WCC_army_first:0 "Army First"
WCC_army_first_desc:0 "MacArthur knows he wouldn't last long without the loyalty of the army. He has made an effort to put them first in every move and decision he makes. From food rations to clothes to payment, the soldiers are served first, and in return they are expected to show the utmost loyalty. Most of them do. His soldiers worship him like a god, and he plans to use their fanaticism to his advantage, against enemies within and without."
WCC_the_watchmen:0 "The Watchmen"
WCC_the_watchmen_desc:0 "We have created a new paramilitary force of sorts, called the Watchmen. These are civilians who have agreed to spy on our citizens for us, for many reasons. Chief among them is the desire to keep MacArthur safe and to find any potential rivals or enemies within our country. We cannot risk betrayal, not now. Every effort will be taken to silence critics and get rid of traitors."
WCC_mobile_state:0 "The Mobile State"
WCC_mobile_state_desc:0 "Speed and aggression are tactics that MacArthur insists we make key pillars of our military. If we want to win wars, we have to strike our enemies before they have the chance to surround us, a fate he himself has experienced before. This time we will surround the enemy and force them to surrender with lightning speed."
WCC_address_congress:0 "Address Congress"
WCC_address_congress_desc:0 "As much as he embraces the term Caesar, MacArthur has no intentions of sharing the fate of his namesake. He has installed loyal men in Congress, and these men have made his case to the American people even better than he as one man ever could. MacArthur is more popular than ever, and the country is in his tight grip."
WCC_strangle_the_cobra:0 "Strangle the Cobra"
WCC_strangle_the_cobra_desc:0 "Now that we have prevailed over American syndicalism, we should look to the south. Latin America harbors syndicalist snakes still, and we must be wary of them if we are to survive and prosper. They cannot be allowed to continue to exist, for their presence will encourage radicals in our own country. Let us eliminate them."
WCC_nuclear_program:0 "Nuclear Program"
WCC_nuclear_program_desc:0 "A few of our top scientists have privately suggested a nuclear weapons program to MacArthur. Such a weapon is still unknown and untested, and there are many who dismiss it and instead insist we focus on bomb production. MacArthur has been convinced, however, and has given the scientists the green light to proceed with this projet. The future is unknown, but we know one thing: it is ours to take."
WCC_dissident_fate:0 "Dissident Fates"
WCC_dissident_fate_desc:0 "MacArthur is sick of dealing with dissidents in his country. He has been criticized from every side, and now he is taking action to make sure it never happens again. The military and homewatch organizations will round up dissidents and send them to military camps, where they will spend their days doing hard labor for our country. With their help, we will not lose."

### Events - ###

wcc.1.t:0 "Western Command Center Requests Aid"
wcc.1.d:0 "In the United States, an outpost made up of Federalist Forces trapped in the West under General Omar Bradley is fighting a desperate fight for survival. They are now requesting aid from the entente in their fight against populism, socialism and the Pacific. Unlike the more ambiguously friendly MacArthur and Pacific States the WCC leadership seems far more respectful to the Entente and particularly Canada, and many of our advisors believe their survival would be in our best interests. Of course as others believe them to be a lost cause they recommend we do not loan them firearms, funds and small grouping of 'Independent Volunteers' as it would only antagonize a victorious faction."
wcc.1.a:0 "We must aid them"
wcc.1.b:0 "No, they are doomed anyways"

wcc.2.t:0 "Canada Sends Aid"
wcc.2.d:0 "It appears our diplomatic mission has paid off, with the WCC seemingly being the best ally Canada to choose in the war. Of course, there is no guarantee they are not going to aid other factions to hedge their bets, but at least we have the aid we need."
wcc.2.a:0 "Fantastic"

wcc.3.t:0 "Canada Refuses Aid"
wcc.3.d:0 "Our mission to Canada has failed! They appear to not believe we are capable of winning the war and, as such, have refused to support us."
wcc.3.a:0 "Bastards"

wcc.4.t:0 "Fate of PSA Generals"
wcc.4.d:0 "With the PSA having fallen to us, it is time to decide the fate of imprisoned members of their cause. Many are sympathetic to their desire to protect democracy though none will defend what they consider a rash decision to declare war on the federal government and nearly doom America to extremist ideologies that deny modern freedom. Nonetheless, we most would have their soldiers and officers rejoin America if they swear loyalty to the federal government, although doing the opposite will make allow a firmer grip of the West even if it will anger some officers."
wcc.4.a:0 "Conditional Amnesty it is"
wcc.4.b:0 "We can not forgive their treason"

wcc.5.t:0 "What of MacArthurists?"
wcc.5.d:0 "While we were willing to fight under MacArthur when it seemed the only means of defending Congress from the Red Guard, the Minutemen, the NDWL, the seccessionists and an impractical and hypocritical Pacific Congress that sought to overide the national government with its own, it became clear in time that MacArthur was not willing to give up power to either Congress, Eisenhower or Bradley and he would have to go. Now with MacArthur having fallen we must decide whether to offer him full amnety, revive his reputation and gain his mens support or end the threat once and for all."
wcc.5.a:0 "Make MacArthur a General"
wcc.5.b:0 "Declare him a traitor"

wcc.6.t:0 "The Fallen Cause"
wcc.6.d:0 "The South has been felled once again, along with all of the generals whom either agreed with the Old Democrat agenda or had the misfortune of already serving their states when the war started. General Patton was their most prominent leader and many would have us offer him and his men amnesty while maintaining the NDWL as a terrorist organization. However, most others view their cause as beyond redemption and claim that we would be repeating the error of the First Reconstruction in going too easy on the radical white league allies, and as such it will be a bit of an uphill battle to offer them amnesty and ruffle some feathers. Of course, to jail them would mean dealing with the potential backlash."
wcc.6.a:0 "Conditional Amnesty"
wcc.6.b:0 "We must finish their cause"

wcc.7.t:0 "American Standoff"
wcc.7.d:0 "With our foes having been felled in the war, the USA and the WCC are the only combatants left standing. However, our leadership has not always been on the best terms with MacArthur, as the Bradley-Eisnehower circle are nervous of giving MacArthur unchecked power and are hostile to his perceived egomania. As many view their alliance as one of pragmatism and neccesity against common enemies to the Federal Congress and military, many are wondering if the two can peacefully reconcile. If so, it is likely MacArthur will have to share power with Eisenhower and Bradley by giving them autonomous armies and administrations to run."
wcc.7.a:0 "Request he share power"
wcc.7.b:0 "Hit him now"
wcc.7.c:0 "No more bloodshed, reintegrate now"

wcc.8.t:0 "WCC Demands!"
wcc.8.d:0 "The WCC has always had a somewhat tense relationship with MacArthur due to the generals leading it, Eisenhower and Bradley, having more loyalty to the Federal Government, Military and Congress than to him, whom they distrust and view as an egomaniac. Now it has come to a head as they demand we relinquish some power in return for being re-annexed into the US. In this scheme Eisenhower would have a near-automous military government overseeing the reconstruction of the former AUS while Bradley's army would essentially govern the WCC and Pacific States. While MacArthur would still be the executive, this would prevent him from having a total handle on the situation. While some generals consider this treachery, Congressional advisors would prefer we take the deal."
wcc.8.a:0 "Very Well"
wcc.8.b:0 "Treachery, Strike Now!"

wcc.9.t:0 "MacArthur Accepts!"
wcc.9.d:0 "MacArthur has accepted our terms for peaceful reunifications and as such we have both prevented a potential tyranny and reunited America."
wcc.9.a:0 "God Bless America"

wcc.10.t:0 "WCC Reintegrates"
wcc.10.d:0 "Bradley and Eisenhower have acknowledged their lower rank to MacArthur and the United States, agreeing to hand over the WCC to him. This is a relief as they are known to have a sometimes tense relationship with MacArthur, making this a major victory. Of course, we should celebrate their actions and give them the highest honors we can to make the transition smoother."
wcc.10.a:0 "America is Saved!"

wcc.11.t:0 "MacArthur Assumes Command!"
wcc.11.d:0 "General MacArthur has decided he can no longer hold the East and now desires to move his outpost West, where we enjoy superior natural defenses. Of course, privately our leadership is not enthusiastic about this given Eisenhower and Bradley have a tense relationship with the General of the Armies and do not look forward to serving under him, especially given that MacArthur's faction and support base in the West are quite radical and now are even moreso after MacArthur sent word D.C. may be lost. However, our resources are few and that same faction could cause problems if we refuse, something we can not afford, so it appears we have little choice but to give in. Of course, rejecting him would be essentially a declaration of war as it would be a refusal to recognize his authority."
wcc.11.a:0 "Welcome him"
wcc.11.b:0 "Refuse him"

wcc.12.t:0 "WCC Welcomes Us!"
wcc.12.d:0 "The WCC has welcomed us to the West! As such we are preparing our expedition West, likely cutting through a neutral or friendly nation to reach it. Of course, with the situation now increasingly dire MacArthur's radical supporters in the West, nicknamed ' Radical Federalists' have put forward an extreme proposal to save America from the subversive extremists who threaten it and, in the process, us. Already, George Kenney and Richard K. Sutherland have joined them, necessitating MacArthur's reliance on them."
wcc.12.a:0 "We shall not fail"

wcc.13.t:0 "America Restored"
wcc.13.d:0 "Against all odds, we have not only survived, but thrived. The Western Command Center had relinquished all traitors and secured a better future for America, and now we can finally end the period of reconstruction. The United States has been restored and old glory now proudly flies over Washington. And everyone knows that the Military and President Bradley will keep the nation safe. "
wcc.13.a:0 "God Bless America"

wcc.14.t:0 "Appointing Lippmann"
wcc.14.d:0 "Journalist Walter Lippman is a strong supporter of our recent policies, believing our government places pragmatism, specialization and technocratic merits above ideology, and as such he has recently risen to be the lead editor of the New Republic. His position on the responsibility of the intellectual elite to herd the masses into contentment has resulted in some of the Wise Men believing we should place him in charge of overhauling our journalistic education system wholesale in favor of 'Lippmannism', and expect media outlets to meet its qualifications or not be designated as accurate media by the government and our connections."
wcc.14.a:0 "Empower Lippmann"
wcc.14.b:0 "He's fine where he is"

wcc.15.t:0 "Cultivating Ties"
wcc.15.d:0 "What the Wise Men are willing to acknowledge is that the masses are no longer capable of mass democracy as we've known it, as it will only cause death, destruction and collapse. However, this does not mean we need to brutally subjugate them either. We must cultivate ties to the elite classes on the basis of their expertise, not on birthright. As such, we should attempt to place a higher emphasis on meritocracy in our government, with those qualify becoming new members of the political elite who still value science and liberalism. In the process we must shake up some of the old political machines."
wcc.15.a:0 "Of course"
wcc.15.b:0 "Take it slow"

wcc.16.t:0 "Experts Recommend lower tariffs"
wcc.16.d:0 "Some of our policy makers, most notably Dean Acheson, has recently recommended that we lower tariffs with our allies at once. Taking advice from classical economists and the theory of comparative advantage, they state that tariffs are a net negative to our economy, noting that trade will create access to a larger consumer surplus. "

wcc.17.t:0 "A New Federal Reserve"
wcc.17.d:0 "The Federal Reserve is being recreated with a higher emphasis on expertise in economics, particularly economic training or leadership in banking. As such, an internal debate has broken out over which economists we should favor, those who place a higher emphasis on fighting unemployment or fighting inflation. Naturally, those who are chosen will gain a significant edge in government circles, and as such some think we should keep out of it, and simply appoint approved economists who are approved by our think tanks and/or other institutions, and let them do what they will."

wcc.18.t:0 "Push for Entente Membership"
wcc.18.d:0 "The Wise Men, especially Dean Acheson and Charles E. Bohlen, are pushing for us to join the Entente so we may provide it with proper support. They note that their analysts and studies show that this would give us a significant strategic advantage over foreign empires and syndicalism."
wcc.18.a:0 "Very Well"
wcc.18.b:0 "No, we must remain independent"

wcc.19.t:0 "Establishment of Policy Planning Staff"
wcc.19.d:0 "The Wise Man George F. Kennan has been appointed the head of the newly created Policy Planning Staff, established as a think tank to aid in the State Department in establishing strategic aims. In his newly prepared article, 'The Sources of Syndicalist Conflict', he recommends containing syndicalism through counter-propaganda and 'counterforce at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points', stating that while syndicalism can never be at peace with capitalism due to its current ideology, it is weak in the long-run and we can avoid outright warfare with them. As such his proposals would entail strengthening the Entente and investing in further pro-Western propaganda."
wcc.19.a:0 "Follow the Report"
wcc.19.b:0 "Only invest in counter-propaganda"

wcc.20.t:0 "Lobbyist Competition"
wcc.20.d:0 "Lobbyists have proved to be a useful means of connecting the new technocratic class with the desires of larger industry, with the lobbyists being themselves experts in this regard. Of course, while rent-seeking will have to be opposed, this communication is essential to a healthy economy and grants simpler access to required and vital resources, and already lobbyists in the growing military industries are competing for further attention with those who desire tax cuts for civilian industries. Should we favor one?"
wcc.20.a:0 "Favor Neither"
wcc.20.b:0 "Favor Military Lobbyists"
wcc.20.c:0 "Favor Civilian Lobbyists"

wcc.21.t:0 "Recruiting Harriman"
wcc.21.d:0 "With our retaking of New England, there has been much discussion of which members of the educated elite of New England into our government. Of them, William Averall Harriman is one of the most accepted, and placing him in charge of some local thinks tanks could help facilitate control over the region. Of course, we could make him a diplomat as well."
wcc.21.a:0 "Appoint Harriman as a leader"
wcc.21.b:0 "Make Harriman a diplomat"

wcc.22.t:0 "A New President?"
wcc.22.d:0 "With the US reconstituted we are being pressed to re-establish the United States Presidency, albeit with the office now heavily influenced by the new Fourth Wing of Government, a mix of highly-ranked bureaucrats, military leaders and foreign, economic and strategic policy analysts. As such, we should ensure the next president is appropriate to govern the population in these times, and capable of wise and capable governance. We could have Omar Bradley himself run, although that may be controversial given his position as an unelected leader of the WCC. After the nomination by a new Democratic Party, we will hold a snap election."
wcc.22.a:0 "Nominate Omar Bradley"
wcc.22.b:0 "Use politician Pat McCarren"
wcc.22.c:0 "Put forward Eisenhower"

wcc.23.t:0 "Return of Indirect Elections?"
wcc.23.d:0 "With much of the blame of the Civil War and even MacArthur's tyranny being placed on 'populism' and similar concepts that placed too much direct voting power in the hands of laymen who, believing in nonsense and trained in nothing related to government, readily vote for demagogues who oppose those who do know better, namely an actually educated 'elite'. This has lead to debates on recreating the original conditions of the US constitution in regards to the Senate, meaning they would be indirectly elected through state legislatures, helping those who are more fit to govern to properly represent their constituents."
wcc.23.a:0 "Of course"
wcc.23.b:0 "It's not needed"

wcc.24.t:0 "Pat McCarren Elected"
wcc.24.d:0 "Nevada Senator Pat McCarren has been elected President of the United States. A close ally of the WCC during the war, McCarren leans heavily on the Wise Men for advise on stopping syndicalism in the United States and abroad."
wcc.24.a:0 "A Victory"

wcc.25.t:0 "Eisenhower elected president"
wcc.25.d:0 "General Eisenhower has been elected president of the United States. As a man who served as a general in the WCC and a close associate of Bradley, he was considered less controversial to become president than Bradley himself. He is expected to rule from 'The Middle of the Road', as he puts it, and places a high emphasis on national security."
wcc.25.a:0 "A Victory"

wcc.26.t:0 "Bradley elected president"
wcc.26.d:0 "General Bradley has been elected president of the United States. As the former leader of the WCC he is credited with saving American democracy and as such was a shoe-in for the Presidency. Although he remains controversial for his wartime leadership in some circles most of the press appears reluctant to outright criticize him."
wcc.26.a:0 "A Victory"

wcc.27.t:0 "MacArthur Addresses Congress"
wcc.27.d:0 "General MacArthur has won the war and as such, announces a new nation to Congress, at least what is left of Congress that remained loyal to MacArthur. The Congress would serve to administrate civilian areas of the nation, while all other executive power would be wrapped in the military and devoted to combating socialist threats. While many suspect the speech and his recent 'conversion' in politics was due to a combination of his newly radicalized supporters and his lower powerbase outside of it, as well as the chaos of the nation, none dared disagree, as those few MacArthurists still in Congress applauded."
wcc.27.a:0 "Victory at last"

wcc.28.t:0 "Alvin Owsley appointed Legion Chief"
wcc.28.d:0 "Alvin Owsley was one of the few in the WCC to fervently support MacArthur's return, and as such he has been appointed as the lifetime executive of the American Legion for veterans. As nearly all power now rests in the military this is a massively powerful position, one he promises to use to support maintaining veteran support of the new state."
wcc.28.a:0 "Wonderful"

wcc.29.t:0 "The Blue Terror"
wcc.29.d:0 "In what is being dubbed an American 'Blue Terror', the military is wiping out the Syndicalists and Old Klan who once held a strong grasp over the East. With swift military tribunals only being afforded to high ranking militia members, commanders are often entrusted to have investigators find militia members in hiding and swiftly arresting them. The effects of the so-called terror against extremist is clear as their capabilities collapse and the military directly occupies these territories, often deciding which to keep and which to allow Congress to administrate."

### National Focuses ###

Antillean_Union_Focus: "Antillean Union Focus Tree"

ANT_antillean_navy: "Protecting the Union"
ANT_antillean_navy_desc: "Our nation is a nation of islands, and as such control of the seas around them is imperative for our survival. We should lay the seeds for a united fleet of the Antilles."
ANT_dockyard: "Shipyards of the Antilles"
ANT_dockyard_desc: "A fleet isn't made in a day. By enlisting the help and knowledge of the great shipyards of the Caribbean it will be possible to increase our shipbuilding capabilities."
ANT_dubmarina: "Los Lobos del Mar"
ANT_dubmarina_desc: "Submarines are the future - or so our naval experts tell us. By investing in these "sea wolves" - lobos del mar - we can instill fear in enemy ships even when facing terrible odds."
ANT_more_dockyards: "The Naval Effort"
ANT_more_dockyards_desc: "Naval powerhouses such as the United States or Canada have had decades of experience to build their own naval forces. Our nation is a young one, and we got some catching up to do."
ANT_naval_doctrine_focus: "Learning the Ropes"
ANT_naval_doctrine_focus_desc: "Every marine is crucial in battle - but so is the admiral leading them. By sending the brighest of our students to foreign naval academies they can return with improved know-how."
ANT_destroyer: "Antillean Destroyers"
ANT_destroyer_desc: "While the Union has much to learn from other nations in regards to the naval game, we cannot be totally reliant on them. Investing on a strong fleet, designed and built in our own ports, must be seen as a continuation of the independence struggle."
ANT_base_air_sea: "The San Juan-Havana Airway"
ANT_base_air_sea_desc: "The Antillean Union is formed by scattered islands, yet it must remain united. Linking two of our greatest cities through a regular air service will yield important profits and provide extra military options, should the need arise."
ANT_more_air_bases: "The Havana-Santo Domingo Airway"
ANT_more_air_bases_desc: "While Cuba and Puerto Rico are already linked through the skies, our brothers and sisters in Hispaniola remain distant. Like a mother pelican, the great Antillean Union has to embrace all its children, and for that purpose new airports will be built between Santo Domingo and our largest city."
ANT_the_union: "The Antillean Constitution"
ANT_the_union_desc: "The Union's three constituent members - Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic - are as diverse in shape as they are in how the Union should function. While Puerto Ricans favor equality in both parliament and taxes, Cubans prefer a more federal approach that would ensure their own economical dominance over the Union. The Dominicans accept a federal model, as long as Cuba agrees to bear the burden of the Union's budget. While the consensus is towards a limited constitution modeled after that of the United States, the choice of capital will truly set the course for the Antilleans' future."
ANT_havana_capital: "The City of Columns"
ANT_havana_capital_desc: "The largest city of the Caribbean, Havana is a regional powerhouse, with its industry, hotels and services being well-regarded throughout the region. Setting the capital of the Union inside Cuba will no doubt ensure Cuban interests - as diverse as they may be - will reign."
ANT_economic_renaissance: "Economic Renaissance"
ANT_economic_renaissance_desc: "As the bridge between North and South America, and thanks to its proximity to the Panama Canal, the Antillean Union can connect oceans and continents through its ports. Therein lies the opportunity for all of the Antilles to rejoice under a new renaissance, bringing much prosperity to the nation."
ANT_san_juan_capital: "The Walled City"
ANT_san_juan_capital_desc: "From San Juan came the idea of an Antillean Union, and in San Juan will this idea flourish and grow! Decades of American control has made Puerto Rico the undisputed capital of finances within our country, so it's only natural the city remains as the national capital."
ANT_lessons_from_america: "Lessons from America"
ANT_lessons_from_america_desc: "Although riddled by the ruin of Depression and civil war, few can deny the Americans know how to make money. With the Union in dire need of a working budget for day-to-day work, it is necessary to focus on the valuable lessons taught to us by Washington."
ANT_santo_domingo_capital: "The First City"
ANT_santo_domingo_capital_desc: "Between Cuba and Puerto Rico lies the island of Hispaniola, and within it the crown jewel of the Caribbean, Santo Domingo. The first city of the Americas, its symbolic importance is paramount for a nation that is still trying to forge an identity of its own."
ANT_development_effort: "Antillean Finances"
ANT_development_effort_desc: "The Antillean Union is a sea of calm in a continent darkened by warfare. From Canada and its dream of reconquest to Argentina and its ambitions, investing in the Americas is a risky proposition... unless you know where to spend your money. The Santo Domingo Stock Exchange will be more than happy to provide a safe harbor for this foreign capital."
ANT_industrial_effort: "Masonic Contacts"
ANT_industrial_effort_desc: "The forefather of our great Union, Ramón Emeterio Betances, was a well-known freemason. To this day, the Gran Logia Soberana de Puerto Rico holds great political influence across the Antilles, holding businessmen, captains of industry and bankers among its ranks. It's time we reach towards these patriots."
ANT_prospecting: "The Mines of Hispaniola"
ANT_prospecting_desc: "The eastern half of Hispaniola is full of riches, from precious metals such as gold to more common commodities like steel. Investing in new mines will pay off in the future."
ANT_radio_antillas: "Radio Antillas"
ANT_radio_antillas_desc: "Although the Union is a political success, many Cubans, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans still don't feel part of the same great whole. By creating a national radio service, with football, movies and soap operas, we can forge a common national identity."
ANT_university_san_juan: "University of Puerto Rico"
ANT_university_san_juan_desc: "The University of Puerto Rico must be further financed and expanded if we are to join the civilized nations of the world."
ANT_heavy_industrialization: "Fuel the Industry"
ANT_heavy_industrialization_desc: "The backbone of a nation's true power comes from its industry. It is absolutely crucial that we invest in an expansive program of industrial development in our Union."
ANT_guns: "Modern Warfare"
ANT_guns_desc: "As technology advances, we ought to preserve our manpower and throw bullets, not men, at the enemy. Investing in artillery now will prove a smart choice whenever a future conflict arises."
ANT_crown_jewel: "The Crown Jewel of the Caribbean"
ANT_crown_jewel_desc: "The Antilles represent what the Caribbean does best: showing a taste of paradise to mere mortals. By attracting tourists from Europe and refugees from war-torn America we can pull further investment into our infrastructure."
ANT_santo_domingo_san_juan: "The Santo Domingo-Havana Airway"
ANT_santo_domingo_san_juan_desc: "Linking Hispaniola and Puerto Rico by air is not only a matter of convenience, but a proof of Antillean ingenuity that will surprise the world!"
ANT_more_guns: "Guns of the Antilles"
ANT_more_guns_desc: "The tropical islands of the Antilles are not exactly made for long marches, fancy weaponry such as tanks or trench warfare. If an enemy comes at our soil, we must strike decisively."
ANT_modern_army: "Fighting on Foreign Lands"
ANT_modern_army_desc: "If we are to exert a military presence elsewhere, we will need to move and strike quickly. With the right amount of motorized vehicles we can get to the enemy before they are ready to face Antillean might."
ANT_military_investment: "Preparing a Military Industry"
ANT_military_investment_desc: "The stereotypical image of the Antillean soldier as an ill-prepared caudillo must be proven wrong. We need modern arms in the hands of our warriors, and for that we must feed the hungry fires of industry."
ANT_foreign_scientists: "Invite American Intelligentsia"
ANT_foreign_scientists_desc: "Right now, thousands of 'brains' - the brighest minds of America - flee in terror as different factions and militias run amok in the once great nation. With general allowances, perhaps these scientists, teachers and especialists will accept to lecture and further their studies in our universities."
ANT_antillean_airforce: "An Antillean Air Force"
ANT_antillean_airforce_desc: "To master the skies we must build a proper air force, separate from the army and the navy. Only with this independence can our pilots reach their ultimate potential."
ANT_air_academy: "La Academia Antillana"
ANT_air_academy_desc: "Antillean pilots, from Santiago de Cuba to Bayamón, are among the best in all of Central America. Perhaps it would be wise to invest more in training and research for our air operations, lest we waste their potential."
ANT_fighter: "Choosing Fighters"
ANT_fighter_desc: "Cubans, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans each seem to prefer their own brand of aircraft. It is time to settle this issue and pick a single design for the entire Antillean Air Force."
ANT_bomber: "Bombers from Berlin"
ANT_bomber_desc: "While choosing a fighter model wasn't easy, most of our Air Force staff seem to agree the Germans excel at bomber design. We should arrange a visit to Berlin and acquire some new blueprints."
ANT_even_more_bases: "Mastery of the Skies"
ANT_even_more_bases_desc: "Nothing can beat a fighter flying above the waves - let's ensure our people can take off and land wherever necessary."
ANT_naval_academy: "A New Generation of Officers"
ANT_naval_academy_desc: "A unified naval academy will go a long way towards ensuring our naval officers can learn about new developments."
ANT_antillean_army: "The Antillean Army"
ANT_antillean_army_desc: "It is crucial that we forge a national army, ready to defend our shores against any sign of foreign agression."
ANT_militia_forces: "Militia Forces"
ANT_militia_forces_desc: "Each of our constituent countries retain regional militias for themselves. We must unite all militia forces under a single command structure, and ensure the supremacy of the Union Army."
ANT_defense_homeland: "Defense of the Homeland"
ANT_defense_homeland_desc: "The Spaniards exploited our lands for a long time, and the Americans merely replaced them as our tyrannical overlords. Now however the Antilles are truly free, and we shall never lose this freedom ever again."
ANT_three_peoples: "Three Peoples, One Nation"
ANT_three_peoples_desc: "It doesn't matter where you come from - all three peoples are equal under the might of the Antillean Union, even if some may not be that equal in practise. In any case, military service will ensure full political rights to any man who dares joining the struggle for national survival."
ANT_modern_equipment: "Modern Equipment"
ANT_modern_equipment_desc: "War, war never changes, yet the equipment used to fight it does. We shall occupy our scientists with modernizing our current materiel, so we are ready for the next battle."
ANT_new_guns: "The New Guns"
ANT_new_guns_desc: "Why send a brave Antillean soldier to his death, when we can explode the enemy with a single shot from a might gun instead? Artillery is the future of warfare, so let's keep focused on it."
ANT_army_doctrine: "Looking Ahead"
ANT_army_doctrine_desc: "Nestled in the heart of the Americas, the Antillean Union may need to change its strategical needs as the situation dictates. If that ever happens, our army must follow suit."
ANT_marines: "Fighting Islanders"
ANT_marines_desc: "A nation of islanders, any war with a foreign nation will certainly involve a large deal of seaborne invasions. By training our best soldiers in the tradition of the American and European marines, we shall stay one step ahead in securing key beachheads."

# American-formed
ant.1.t: "A Strongly Worded Letter"
ant.1.d: "With syndicalism taking hold in the former West Indies Federation and Cuba under the thumb of the United States more than ever, it seems our supposed ally to the north has concocted a grandiose scheme to limit the influence of socialism on the Caribbean without consulting our nation in the least. The United States has demanded that we be absorbed along with Cuba into a new united Antillean nation. While we will receive representation and key cabinet positions within the new nation's government, they have all but demanded our fair Republic relinquish its sovereignty completely. Were any option available to us to resist this crazy scheme, we would of course take it, but having thrown our lot in with the Americans, it seems we have little choice."
ant.1.a: "We must give in."

ant.2.t: "The Birth of the Union"
ant.2.d: "With the United States recovered from its devastating civil war, it now seeks to eliminate the threat of syndicalism internationally. The West Indies Federation's descent into revolution has been of particular interest and given the United States has retained its influence over both our own nation and the Dominican Republic it now seems we are to be roped into some great scheme to ensure that syndicalism never again reaches our own shores. Both we and the Dominicans have been approached by our respective American consuls demanding that we agree to form a federation. This Antillean Union as the Americans call it will have its foreign affairs managed closely by Washington. While this is obviously an affront and a betrayal of the great debt the Americans owe for our loyalty during their great internal conflict, there is little we can do to resist. The Dominicans, likewise, have already begrudgingly agreed to the proposal."
ant.2.a: "Oh Lord, this is something."

ant.3.t: "Puerto Rico And The Antilles"
ant.3.d: "The idea of a union of Spanish-speaking islands in the Caribbean first arose in Puerto Rico. With the formation of our new Antillean puppet, some in our government would consider transferring the island to their authority. This would free up resources on the island while still maintaining our authority de-facto."
ant.3.a: "Give it to them."
ant.3.b: "It shall remain American."

ant.4.t: "The Transfer Of Puerto Rico"
ant.4.d: "The United States has transfered the island of Puerto Rico to us. Our new nation is whole at last."
ant.4.a: "Welcome home!"

ant.5.t: "A New Flag, An Old Banner"
ant.5.d: "First proposed by Puerto Rican revolutionaries, the concept of a union of Spanish-speaking antillean nations is not a new one. With Puerto Rico now under our control, some suggest adopting the banner proposed then to represent an antillean nation."
ant.5.a: "Adopt it."
ant.5.b: "The current flag works."

### Events ###

hnn.1.t:0 "The Province of Hunan"
hnn.1.d:0 "The Xiang Clique in Hunan was once a major clique in Southern China. Under the leadership of the two cliques of Tan Yankai and Tang Xiangming, the province of Hunan was influential in Southern Chinese and Tongmenghui politics.\n\nIn 1916, Tang Jiyao declared the independence of Yunnan, leading to multiple other provinces declaring independence along with it - Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and many others. Hunan found itself under siege, and the National Protection Alliance put as its governor Tang Shengzhi, the Buddhist General. He enacted his Buddhisisation Program, but was pushed back a few years later, being replaced by the Federalist Zhao Hengti as governor. After the end of the Zhili victory over Southern China, it was incorporated into the League of Eight Provinces, with Zhao Hengti declaring his personal alliegiance to lie with Sun Chuanfang in Nanjing.\n\nWith Sun Chuanfang's death, however, Hunan, one of the already autonomous provinces of the League of Eight Provinces, has regained full provincial autonomy under Zhao Hengti once again. The time ahead is a turbulent one - The brother of Tang Shengzhi, Tang Shengming, is making attempts to bring his brother back to Hunan and into power once again. Cheng Qian, the Nationalist-KMT supporter, also looks to take over the province.\n\nTo the south is the Liangguang Clique, led by Chen Jiongming. Even though Zhao Hengti claims to be a federalist, Chen shows it. To the west are the Cliques of Sichuan and Yunnan, eyeing us with hungry looks. To the North are Hunan's friends - the Northern Zhili, but their power may not last forever."
hnn.1.a:0 "It is time for action."

#Choosing Path Events

hnn.2.t:0 "Restoration of the Hunan Provincial Constitution"
hnn.2.d:0 "Zhao Hengti, the governor, is obsessed with legal procedures, no matter how rigged they are. Because of this, he has suggested that the province restore the old provincial constitution enacted in the 1920s. The future of the province depends on his decision."
hnn.2.a:0 "Restore the Constitution!"
hnn.2.b:0 "Pfft, who even needs legal procedures?"

hnn.3.t:0 "The Constitution Restored"
hnn.3.d:0 "We have decided to restore the constitution. We are now, in name and in some way in government, a democracy. We shall keep our land free and safe, and all our citizens will know the freedom of Hunan."
hnn.3.a:0 "Three Cheers for Hunan!"

hnn.4.t:0 "The Constitution Rejected"
hnn.4.d:0 "We have decided to reject the restoration of the constitution. We are a province, not a republic. There is no need for us to do so, to repeat the mistakes of our past that led to us becoming part of the League. Governor Zhao has teared up the Constitution with his hands and left it to burn. It has been decided - Hunan will no longer be democratic."
hnn.4.a:0 "Three Cheers for Hunan!"

hnn.5.t:0 "Elections Announced"
hnn.5.d:0 "With the restoration of the Hunan Provincial Constitution, Governor Zhao Hengti has decided to announce the new Hunan provincial elections. Candidates will need to announce themselves to run, and the people will be allowed to choose between them, depending on how they would like Hunan to be run and under what sort of governorship. All Hunanese can run, but not many are actually interested in politics. It is also suspected by many that Zhao Hengti has some tricks up his sleeve regarding the elections..."
hnn.5.a:0 "A Victory for Constitutionalism!"

hnn.6.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi Returns to Hunan"
hnn.6.d:0 "The Buddhist General, Tang Shengzhi, former governor of Hunan, has returned to the province today. After hearing about the constitution being restored, the Buddhist General decided to pack up his bags and move back from Hong Kong to Hunan. With the help of his brother, General Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi is temporarily staying in an inn in Changsha. He has not done anything yet, but many beleive the former governor to have come back to run for governor. Indeed, he is quite popular within the military and the general populace for his 'Revolutionary Socialism' and Buddhisisation policies, and if he were to run, he would prove quite the threat to Zhao Hengti's reign."
hnn.6.a:0 "What might he be planning to do?"

hnn.7.t:0 "Cheng Qian Leaves For Hunan"
hnn.7.d:0 "General Cheng Qian, orginally from Hunan expressed a desire to contest that country's newly announced general elections. He was given the go-ahead for his plan and has now left for Hunan."
hnn.7.a:0 "Hopefully he finds success."

hnn.8.t:0 "Cheng Qian Returns To Hunan"
hnn.8.d_1:0 "While the nationalist revolt in Longyang was crushed, Cheng Qian, an old KMT aggitator from our province, managed to escape with his life.

He visited his family along with old childhood friends, and made multiple speeches around the city, gathering the attention of many people. However, his countrymen were indifferent to him, and when the Governor slipped during his speech, the reaction to his presence was openly hostile. He was booed and insulted. It seems that the population of Hengyang has turned to the alternative candidates..."

hnn.10.a:0 "Hopefully he finds his footing."

hnn.11.t:0 "Campaign in Yiyang"
hnn.11.d:0 "Cheng Qian has found support in the city of Yiyang and the surrounding region. In a rousing speech, he stressed his humble origins and desire for Hunan to stand on its own two feet potentially separate even from the KMT in Longyang. Zhao Hengti and Tang Shengzhi have attempted to respond to this surge in support for Cheng in the area. Who shall ultimate be the city's favored candidate?"

hnn.12.d:0 "Tang Shengzhi chose to begin his campaign in Changde, and has made steady headway in that important city. Recently, however, controversy has errupted in the city over Tang's actions during the Constitution Protection Movement. If the flames of this controversy were to be flamed, Tang could lose the city."
hnn.12.a:0 "Zhao Hengti fans the flames."
hnn.12.b:0 "Tang Shengzhi hold on."
hnn.12.c:0 "Cheng Qian fans the flames."

hnn.13.t:0 "Down To The Countryside"
hnn.13.d:0 "Through the efforts of Tang Shengzhi's brother, Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi has redoubled his support in the countryside, particularly the highly populous the countryside around Changsha. Unwilling to cede the peasantry, the vast majority of the population though not a particularly politicized group, Zhao Hengti and Cheng Qian have also gone down to the countryside to campaign. Who finds the greatest support?"

hnn.14.t:0 "Shaoshan Incident"
hnn.14.d:0 "Angered by Tang Shengzhi's land policies during his governorship and the apathy of Zhao Hengti, a group of intermediaries from the small backwater of Shaoshan havve started an uproar which is now reverberating throughout the countryside. They demand that whatever may come, actually bring grains and cash crops grown by large estates to market which has long been seen as immoral, be given state recognition. Because many of these intermediaries themselves also run large farms stocked with hired laborers, their impact has been particularly large."
hnn.14.a:0 "Zhao Hengti promises them what they want."
hnn.14.b:0 "Tang Shengzhi agrees to incorporate them into his land reform policies."
hnn.14.c:0 "Cheng Qian promises them what they want."

hnn.15.t:0 "The Slums Of Changsha"
hnn.15.d:0 "Changsha has grown greatly in recent years, spurred by economic change and the beginnings of industrialisation, especially as many peasants have sought protection from campaigns which have ravaged their billages. The shanties on the edge of the city have become substantial, and while considered a blight their residents must at least be pandered to if the illusion of universal male suffrage is to be maintained. Who best appeals to them?"

hnn.19.t:0 "The Governor"
hnn.19.d:0 "There has been a shocking turn of events as Zhao Hengti has stripped the province of Hunan of most of its legal procedures. He has rebounded on his promises of elections for governorship. The cries of the people were not heard, and Zhao promises prosperity and a new Hunan."
hnn.19.a:0 "Long live the Governor!"

hnn.20.t:0 "Protests in Changsha"
hnn.20.d:0 "On the streets of Changsha, the sky clouded by mist, one could barely see past the mountains and seas of people protesting. One could barely hear across the noise they were making. It was clear that the people were not for the new policies of the governor, and are calling out for a return of democracy to the province.\n\nZhao Hengti, however, has remained calm, lounging in his office chair all day, sending more and more guards out to crack down on the protestors."
hnn.20.a:0 "So this is how democracy dies..."

hnn.21.t:0 "Wu Peifu Supports Us"
hnn.21.d:0 "In the North, Marshal Wu Peif has sent a letter to us, promising to help us in our cause and to help Zhao Hengti. With the Hunan-Hubei border becoming ever so militarized, it seems as if Wu Peifu will retaliate to the anti-Zhao Hengti protests with force if they get too out of hand."
hnn.21.a:0 "In times of need, we need a helping hand."

hnn.22.t:0 "The Buddhist General Returns"
hnn.22.d:0 "Amidst the rising tensions between the people and the Governor, General Tang Shengming managed to bring back his brother from Guizhou, where he was hiding in a small mountain village. Tang Shengzhi, the Buddhist General, entered Changsha today, his face instantly recognizable by the local citizens from his Buddhisisation propaganda back when he was a governor. He became a topic of hot debate overnight, with family dinners interrupted by provincial politics.\n\nHe is currently staying at his brother's residence in Changsha, and rumors have been circulating about a potential plot to restore him to power."
hnn.22.a:0 "What plans does he have going on in his mind?"

hnn.23.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi Speaks Out"
hnn.23.d:0 "The recently returned General Tang Shengzhi has spoken out against the revoking of the Provincial Constitution, calling it un-democratic and a betrayal of the province and her people. Along with his brother, Tang Shengming, Tang Shengzhi has been incredibly vocal about Zhao Hengti and his actions. It is even suspected that the General has sent spies to sabotage the acts of the Governor."
hnn.23.a:0 "He is nothing but trouble..."

hnn.24.t:0 "Assassination Attempt on the Governor!"
hnn.24.d:0 "As the assassin entered the room, clutching the pistol in his pocket, he knew that he had two options - to succeed, or to fail. His comrades would have told him that he could step back and turn away at any moment, that he still had a long life to live. But the decision had already been made. There was no turning back.\n\nZhao Hengti must die."
hnn.24.a:0 "It's time."

hnn.25.t:0 "Failed Assassination of Zhao Hengti!"
hnn.25.d:0 "The assassin's dead body was burned this morning. No one knew who he was, and no one cared for him. He had died, four shots in his chest, the blood long dried up.\n\nGovernor Zhao went up to the podium to deliver a speech today. He has shockingly had an attempt on his life performed on him, but he valiantly fought the assassin, killing him. He has displayed the assassin's body as a threat to all those who dare to oppose him."
hnn.25.a:0 "How could someone do this to our governor?"

hnn.26.t:0 "The Military Flocks to Tang Shengzhi"
hnn.26.d:0 "As a very popular figure in the military, the Buddhist General Tang Shengzhi has garnered much support amongst the divisions of Hunan, riling up many generals and corporals to take his side. It seems that a military resistance is building, one that may threaten Zhao Hengti's rule over Hunan."
hnn.26.a:0 "Troubling..."

hnn.27.t:0 "Pro-Constitutional Protests Escalate"
hnn.27.d:0 "More protests have been springing up over the province lately, with the local people very much angry at the constitution being teared up and revoked. There was a large protest in front of the Hunan Provincial Council building yet again today, and another one in Hengyang a few days ago. Over time, these protests have become much bigger and louder, gathering many people each day. Some have reported even seeing Pro-Tang Shengzhi banners being used in the protests."
hnn.27.a:0 "Are they really that angry about some useless paper?"

hnn.28.t:0 "Riots Break Out"
hnn.28.d:0 "A riot occurred today in Changsha. It started as a normal protest, but after a spat between a Constitutionalist and a Provincial Council member escalated too far, a full-on riot broke out, with people punching in the air. The local army was sent in, managing to push back the rioters down the streets and putting an end to the temporary chaos."
hnn.28.a:0 "Damn it, we need to keep this under control!"

hnn.29.t:0 "Violence in the Streets"
hnn.29.d:0 "Changde and Changsha were hit with another wave of protests this week, with one of them ending bloodily. A guard opened fire on the protestors in Changde, prompting the crowd to go wild and an almost full-blown battle to be fought between the rioters and the guards, resulting in casualties on both sides. Over the past week, protests have become increasingly violent, resulting in serious injuries and even deaths in some cases. With each passing day, it becomes harder to restore order to the province and stop the people from protesting."

hnn.30.t:0 "The Military Revolts!"
hnn.30.d:0 "This morning, under the banner of the Buddhist General, much of our military has declared a revolt!

hnn.31.d:0 "The city of Fenghuang, next to the eastern border of Guizhou, is the site of an ongoing battle between the two sides. Zhao Hengti's militia has entered the city, guns blazing, while the soldiers loyal to Tang Shengzhi have held up a valiant defence."

hnn.32.t:0 "The Battle of Changsha"
hnn.32.d:0 "After the victory of the rebels at Fenghuang, they have moved in to attempt and take Changsha, Zhao Hengti's base. The city has been in chaos for days as the rebels romp through the streets, getting closer and closer to the provincial governor's house. The air is tense, and the ground is stained in blood. If the rebels win, this might mean an end to Zhao Hengti's governorship."
hnn.32.a:0 "The Rebels win!"
hnn.32.b:0 "The Loyalists push the Rebels out!"

hnn.33.t:0 "The Battle of Changde"
hnn.33.d:0 "After Zhao Hengti's pyrrhic victory at Fenghuang, he has gathered up his confidence and his troops yet again, this time to strike at the heart of the rebellion - Changde.

hnn.34.t:0 "The Battle of Hengyang"
hnn.34.d:0 "After a series of close battles and an unsuccessful attempt to take the capital of a side, the revolt is in its last stages. The two sides have finally met with their full forces in the city of Hengyang, the birthplace of Zhao Hengti. With their divisions amassed, this might as well be the final battlefield of the revolt. This battle will decide the fate of Hunan, and whoever wins will be the one who will lead Hunan."

hnn.36.d:0 "An important junction between the two cities of Changsha and Changde, the bases of Zhao Hengti and Tang Shengzhi, respectively, Yiyang has been attacked by the rebels. Tang Shengzhi and a few divisions have come near the city and are currently bombarding the loyalist defenses. Zhao Hengti, hearing these news, has quickly commanded his generals to send a relief force. But, there are fears that the force will not arrive in time, and that Tang Shengzhi will take over the city, making him one step closer to Changsha."
hnn.36.a:0 "Tang breaks the defenses!"
hnn.36.b:0 "The reinforcements arrive!"

hnn.37.t:0 "The Battle of Shaoyang"
hnn.37.d:0 "Shaoyang, a city in the middle of Hunan, has come under attack by the Buddhist General's forces. From Shaoyang, Tang could possibly expand his power to the city of Hengyang and capture Southern Hunan, severing our connections with Liangguang and cornering us in the North. He may also gain control of important roads leading to important cities such as Changsha. It is imperative that Zhao Hengti keep the city if he wishes to survive."
hnn.37.a:0 "Tang kicks the loyalists out!"
hnn.37.b:0 "Zhao routes the rebels!"

hnn.38.t:0 "An Attack at Huaihua"
hnn.38.d:0 "Huaihua, a city in Western Hunan, is currently under the control of the Buddhist General Tang Shengzhi. A force has been sent by the Governor to potentially break the front and capture the city of Huaihua, which could be used as a point to stage an attack on Changde and the North and cut off the Buddhist General's forces in the South. The city is well-defended, and the battle is close. Who will win?"
hnn.38.a:0 "The attack fails!"
hnn.38.b:0 "The attack succeeds!"

hnn.39.t:0 "Across Dongting Lake"
hnn.39.d:0 "Dongting Lake is a large lake in the North of Hunan, after which Hunan is named for (south of the lake). If we are able to cross it, it may provide us with a huge tactical advantage over the rebels and take us closer to Changde. Boats are to be built and sent out into the lake to contest the current dominance by Tang Shengzhi. The objective is to secure coastal villages and hold out."
hnn.39.a:0 "We will capture this lake!"

hnn.40.t:0 "Up the Yuanjiang River"
hnn.40.d:0 "The Yuanjiang is a river that flows from Dongting Lake and through Changde. Now that we have sufficient dominance over the lake, we are to strike up the river.

hnn.40.a:0 "Good luck."

hnn.41.t:0 "A Raid on Changde"
hnn.41.d:0 "Success! Our men have gone up the river and raided Changde, taking with them valuable documents, intelligence, and money. Many good men were lost, but the ones who escaped have brought us an invaluable advantage."
hnn.41.a:0 "A great success!"

hnn.42.t:0 "A Failed Raid"
hnn.42.d:0 "Ou men have been captured and gunned down by the Buddhist General's forces in Changde. It seems they were expecting an attack up the river, and they sprung a trap, encircling the soldiers and forcing them to surrender."
hnn.42.a:0 "You were the chosen ones!"

hnn.43.t:0 "A Suspected Plot"
hnn.43.d:0 "Military officers were overheard during their conversations today, talking about a plot to potentially overthrow the Governor. When news arrived at the Governor's office, he merely nodded and said that he had been expecting such a thing to happen. The Provincial Government has been told not to worry, although fears are brewing that the Governor has underestimated the threat..."

hnn.44.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi Denounces Zhao Hengti"
hnn.44.d:0 "The Buddhist General has once again spoken out, now with much fiercer anger against the Governor. He came onto a balcony in Changde with thousands of people watching him as he listed the many things he accused the current provincial government of. He was seen flanked by his brother, Tang Shengming, among other members of the military. Many concerns have been raised that the general has connections with the plot against Zhao Hengti."

hnn.46.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi Takes Over Hunan"
hnn.46.d:0 "Tang Shengzhi has, once again, established full control over the province of Hunan. Earlier today, Tang Shengzhi and his men entered the Governor's house and ousted him from his position, installing Tang as the new governor. Zhao Hengti was reported to have fled across the provincial border to Hubei, a province under Northern Zhili control. Tang Shengzhi has started his spreading of 'Buddhist Socialism', and Hunan will see a new age, better or worse, under Tang Shengzhi. For now, we must see what he does."
hnn.46.a:0 "The Governor is gone, long live the new Governor!"

hnn.47.t:0 "Tang Shengzhi's Revolutionary Buddhism"
hnn.47.d:0 "The new governor, Tang Shengzhi, has put forth his new ideology into Hunanese society once again. Calling it 'Revolutionary Buddhism', Governor Tang seeks to combine the best parts of many ideologies. He takes his inspiration from the Kuomintang socialists and their message of equality, from the National Protection Alliance and their patriotism, from the ideologies of the Third Internationale, and from the Buddhism of himself and his comrades. Tang Shengzhi combines all these elements to create his perfect new ideology.\n\nEven though some devout Buddhists and right-wingers are opposed to it, many in Hunan accept it, as they believe that it is the right way forward for the modernization of the province. In order for Hunan to step upon the stage of China again, she must first revolutionize."
hnn.47.a:0 "For Buddhism! For Revolution!"

hnn.48.t:0 "The Landlord Problem"
hnn.48.d:0 "There is quite a contentious problem in Hunan - the problem of what to do with our landlords. As Tang Shengzhi is a socialist, he must know how to deal with them effectively. There are three ways to deal with them - to kill them, to give them hard labor ten times the work of an ordinary farmer, or to set them free and tell them to not come back again. Which should the general choose?"
hnn.48.a:0 "Kill them!"
hnn.48.b:0 "Make them work!"
hnn.48.c:0 "Set them free!"

hnn.49.t:0 "The Question of Women"
hnn.49.d:0 "Women constitute a large part of our population. Most adult women in Hunan are simple farmers or housewifes, and do not have any say. However, influential women have begun to push their agenda, to have them working more in factories in big cities and to help women raise their statuses. Their demands are to have women be equal to men in work and pay, and for discrimination against females to be wiped out. However, there has been much opposition from the provincial council and the local men, as they do not wish to give up a large part of their power to women. They want to keep their positions and their male social and economic superiority as best they can. If we promise equality, it will be good for women, but it is a surefire way to anger the men of Hunan. How do we respond?"
hnn.49.a:0 "Social and economic equality now!"

The academy, initially intended to be a university, will not have a board of directors, and Tang Shengzhi will be the chairman of the school, with Gu Chou as the principal. The Yaoxiang Academy, being a private school, is aimed at educating relatively wealthy teenagers. The academy has no specific focus, and it will open in the next year."
hnn.50.a:0 "A noteworthy effort to improve education!"

hnn.51.t:0 "Protests from Monasteries"
hnn.51.d:0 "Some Buddhist monasteries in Hunan have expressed outrage at Tang Shengzhi's new Buddhisisation program, claiming that it took away their way of life and adapted their religion to a harmful political agenda. Tang Shengzhi responded to these monks by saying 'Buddhism is nothing without socialism or politics. If you're concerned about politics being involved in religion, you should look at the Western provinces.'"
hnn.51.a:0 "They probably didn't like that response..."

hnn.52.t:0 "Military Rent Collectors"
hnn.52.d:0 "It has come to the attention of the Provincial Government of Hunan that local landlords have been hiring members of the military to collect rent and evict their tenants for a cut of the rent money. This goes without saying as a severe transgression against the ideals of Buddhist Socialism, and with unanimous agreement from the Provincial Council, the military is to be told to stand down and stop its interference with landowners."
hnn.52.a:0 "These pesky landlords are up to no good!"

hnn.53.t:0 "Military Rent Collectors Stand Down"
hnn.53.d:0 "With the order coming through from Changsha that all members of the military who engaged in the collecting of rent and eviction of tenants to cease their actions, most of the military personnel who engaged in rent collection stopped. They were either demoted or punished, and those who refused the order were stripped of their rank and arrested."

hnn.54.t:0 "Reports on Arms Smuggling"
hnn.54.d:0 "The North-South railway going through Hunan is being used extensively for the transport of cargo, and among it, weapons. These weapons are transported illegally to and from Guangxi, Guangdong, the Foreign Concessions, and the government in Beijing. There is now hot debate in the Provincial Council as to what to do with these illegal arms smugglers. Many members have stated that they do not care about the situation, and some urge governor Tang Shengzhi to take action immediately and crack down on the smugglers. The choice is ultimately his - what do we do with the illegal arms trade?"
hnn.54.a:0 "Starting with the next cargo train that passes through, we must crack down on this at once!"
hnn.54.b:0 "Leave them be, as long as they pay the transport fee they'll be fine."

hnn.55.t:0 "The Xiangjiang Incident"
hnn.55.d:0 "Local reports of suspicious boats on the Xiangjiang were never a matter of importance to the police. However, after a large gunfight in Changde, leaving around a dozen dead and many more wounded involving these boats, the local police force has started to investigate more into these strange barges. Many say that the boats are just regular ones, and that the participants of the gunfight should be apprehended, but some claim that the gunfight and the marked boats are examples of something bigger."
hnn.55.a:0 "I'm sure it's nothing - arrest the troublesome ones and we'll be done with this."
hnn.55.b:0 "This calls for an investigation!"

hnn.56.t:0 "Massive Opium Smuggling Ring Discovered"
hnn.56.d:0 "The investigation of the strange, marked boats and the gunfight on the Xiangjiang River have led to the discovery of a massive illegal opium smuggling ring which has operated under the nose of the Provincial Government for years. Even though the Provincial Government does not care much about the use of opium, the fact that this smuggling ring has continuously avoided taxation has made the Provincial Government agree that this smuggling ring should be stopped. Operating within Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan, this ring is notorious for running from the law and defying local authority."
hnn.56.a:0 "This must be put to an end at once!"

hnn.57.t:0 "Yiguandao Rally"
hnn.57.d:0 "A recent rural Yiguandao rally has turned the public eye to this strange religion. With an old 'Master' holding the rally, members of the Yiguandao tried to spread the word of the Yiguandao across the countryside of Hunan. The cult has been rejected by many farmers and peasants as crazy, but many other also started becoming devout followers. There is now hot debate about the Yiguandao and its possible effects on the province, with many citing the Yiguandao in Shandong, where they are perhaps one of the most powerful forces in the province."
hnn.57.a:0 "This cult is a strange one."

hnn.58.t:0 "Opium Smuggling Ring Discovered in Southern China"
hnn.58.d:0 "An illegal opium smuggling ring has just been discovered by the provincial government of Hunan. They have operated under the noses of the governors of Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and eastern provinces along the Yangtze for many years, consistently evading taxation. Governor Tang Shengzhi of Hunan has dedicated himself in the past week to destroy this smuggling ring, or at least to make it pay taxes. Whatever the case, ceasing the evasion of taxes by thsi group will help us financially."

hnn.59.d:0 "The election was so deeply fraudulent that the results were all but discarded. Zhao Hengti has been re-elected on flimsy grounds. While Tang Shengzhi and Cheng Qian may protest, the duration of the election gave Zhao Hengti sufficient time to cement his rule.

hnn.69.t:0 "Hunan Tentatively Seeks To Join Our Faction"
hnn.69.d:0 "Zhao Hengti was onced a close ally of Chen Jiongming. However, domestic politics in Hunan and his mutual friendships with Wu Peifu have pushed him firmly into our camp recently. As such, seeking protection, Hunan desires to formally link their fate with ours, however, they desire a guarantee. Zhao's request is simple, we shall never remove Zhao Hengti himself as provincial governor, come what may."
hnn.69.a:0 "Agree to the deal."
hnn.69.b:0 "Zhao would make demands of us? Never."

hnn.70.t:0 "A Proposal From Hunan"
hnn.70.d:0 "Hunan, drawing on old connections to the Federalist movement, has requested to join our alliance. Zhao Hengti, however, is not the same man he once was. Once dedicated to constitutionalism, his rule in Hunan has become increasingly authoritarian. As such, many in our government hold strong reservations about allying ourselves with Zhao's Hunan."

hnn.72.t:0 "Hunan's Tang Shengzhi And The NRA"
hnn.72.d:0 "Hunan, led by the old Buddhist commander Tang Shengzhi, has requested to join our faction. Though some are hesitant given Tang's frequent clashes with the nationalist general Cheng Qian, largely, members of our government are sympathetic to Tang. Man to man, Tang Shengzhi, Hunan's governor, has also made a specific demand - he seeks that we declare war upon the Zhili Clique within the next half year. Though not surprising given his old animosity with Wu Peifu, making such a commitment could prove troublesome for us."

hnn.72.b:0 "Reject him."

hnn.73.t:0 "Friends In Hunan"

hnn.74.t:0 "Cheng Qian Seeks Forgiveness And Alliance"
hnn.74.d:0 "Cheng Qian, the Hunanese general who once betrayed us, has suprisingly sent a message begging forgiveness for his past transgressionsand protection for Hunan, still under his control.

hnn.76.d:0 "Hunan's governor, [HNN.GetLeader], has long held the [QIE.GetName]  and its leaders in great contempt.

hnn.85.t:0 "An Uphill Battle"
hnn.85.d:0 "Our war against the [GXCHNN_enemy.GetName] will be quite an uphill battle. In desperation, despite the objections of his closest advisors, especially He Jian, Zhao Hengti has mulled over the idea of seeking intervention by the Federalists to the South. Though Zhao's personal ties to Chen Jiongming are not as strong as they once were, Zhao is confident that he can secure he and his people's continued governance of Hunan within Chen Jiongming's state."
hnn.85.a:0 "Send the message."
hnn.85.b:0 "We will stand alone."

hnn.86.t:0 "A Request From Zhao Hengti"
hnn.86.d:0 "In desperation in the face of a seemingly unwinnable war, Hunan's governor, Zhao Hengti, has approached Chen Jiongming directly for assistance. An old acquiantance of Chen's, and also a proponent of a federal China, Zhao has proposed the integration of his province into our regime. As Zhao also has connections to other factions, some of our staff suggest taking this deal, before Zhao aligns himself against us for personal gain. Others, however, believe that Zhao's price is too high - entering his war to protect Hunan now, and granting Hunan autonomy within our state, beyond that of other provinces. Reading the fine print, such would essentially perpetually secure Zhao's place as governor of Hunan within our nation."
hnn.86.a:0 "A fair proposition."
hnn.86.b:0 "We have our own troubles brewing."

hnn.860.t:0 "Zhao Hengti Attacked"
hnn.860.d_1:0 "Though Zhao Hengti has turned away from federalism in favor of the same tyrannical behavior all too common in China, we still retain ties to Hunan.

hnn.860.d_2:0 "Zhao Hengti, an old friend of Chen Jiongming's has come under attack from a vastly superior foe. Zhao is an a proponent of federalism and prior to this war, was considered to be mulling over an alliance with us, indeed, rumor has it that he mulled over seeking our aid.

hnn.97.t:0 "The Economy of Hunan"
hnn.97.d:0 "Even though Black Monday did little to affect the inland provinces, Hunan was still hit by it. There was a significant economic downurn overnight, but not anything to destroy the economy. Hunan has been in a rather stable position for years now, with a relatively weak economy amongst the other Chiense provinces. Our main exports are rhubarb, musk, honey, tobacco, hemp, and birds, and we are an important producer of tea and ramie, both of which, under the League of Eight Provinces, were sold to the concessions. The province must now use its abilities to improve our economy, do business with other powers in China, and set our province on the right path."
hnn.97.a:0 "We must aim for a better economy."

hnn.98.t:0 "Economic Woes Gone"

He claims that the book's portrayal of anthropomorphized animals acting with no difference other than physically than human beings was an insult to the humanity. He further explains that children, when seeing humans and animals on the same level as each other, will start to regard them as so, something he described as having 'disastrous' consequences.\n\nSoldiers were commanded to throw away and burn any copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland they saw. Across the province, his action has been seen very poorly by local parents and children."

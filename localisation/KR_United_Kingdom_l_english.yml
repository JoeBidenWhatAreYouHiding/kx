POLITICS_GEORGE_GBR_DESC: "The King-Emperor, as he styles himself still, has reigned over the British Empire, ever since Britain's triumphant victory in the Great War. With his own cousin, the Kaiser, defeated and the once mighty German Empire humbled it would appear that Britain and her King may rest on their laurels. But there are those would whisper that a great tumult is on the horizon, with Stanley Baldwin's government still struggling to handle the Depression and the resurgent German Reich speaking of conquests that would run roughshod over Europe. With his heir to be the maligned Prince Edward, it remains to be seen if the King, a gallant defender of British hegemony, will succumb to his age or continue to rule the Empire on which the Sun shall never set."
POLITICS_EDWARD_GBR_DESC: "The first son of King George V, Edward VIII was born 23 June 1894 in the outskirts of London, named such after this late uncle. With a traditional childhood and tutoring, the young Prince was initially destined for a military schooling in the navy, first at Osborne and then Dartmouth. While a course of two years and entry into the navy was planned, this was cut short following his father's ascension to the throne. Preparations to prepare Edward for future leadership were started in earnest, being sent to Magdalen College at Oxford, despite allegations of being underprepared intellectually, ultimately leaving Oxford after eight terms, without any academic qualifications. By the time of the Great War, Edward was of legal age to join and enthusiastically signed into the Grenadier Guards but was refused deployment to the frontlines in case the heir apparent be captured or killed. Nevertheless, he would travel to the frontlines as often as he could and undertook military flights from 1918 onwards, making him deeply popular among veterans for his eagerness to fight alongside them. But Edward would return to a country that was disillusioned by its defeat and suffering from economic depression, a fact Edward note on during his many tours of poverty-stricken areas of Britain to meet with local people and take on board their concerns. But despite his efforts to reach out to the common populace, Edward would be evacuated with his family to Canada in 1925 amid the British Revolution despite his proposal that he return to the frontlines to fight the syndicalist menace.\n\nIndeed, Edward had fuilfilled this dream and under his reign the British exiles have arisen from their icy fortress across the sea to strike back and take back the birthright. Undeterred, a now wisened and forever-changed King, Edward still continues to tour the devestated ruins of Britain at times to meet adoration and at others, scorn. Regardless of how is subjects may seem him, love him or hate him, King Edward will forever be remembered as the man who took back Britain, the King under which the Empire would strike back."
POLITICS_ALBERT_GBR_DESC: "Throughout the war, King Albert’s voice was one that many across the Entente tuned into to hear the King’s hopeful words of encouragement to the soldiers and citizens alike to push through.\n\nNow in Britain, the King’s return to London was a topic of mixed reactions in Britain. Many believe the King’s return was the last sign of the Union’s demise, while the others see his performance in Canada as a more figurehead-like King as a way that Britain will be returned to the democracy it once was, and King Albert I is the sign of a new era of rebuilding and prosperous times in Britain. Only time will tell how the new King will handle the new Britain."
POLITICS_KING_HENRY_GBR_DESC: "Throughout the war, King Henry's voice was one that many across the Entente tuned into to hear. The King's hopeful words of encouragement to the soldiers and citizens alike to push through inspired our brave soldiers.\n\nNow in Britain, the King's return to London was a topic of mixed reactions by the liberated population. Many believe the King's return is the last sign of the Union's destruction, while the others see his performance in Canada as a unifying figure as the ingredient that will return Britain to the democracy it once was. Only time will tell how the principled King will handle the rift within the new Britain."
POLITICS_KING_GEORGE_GBR_DESC: "Throughout the war, King George's voice was one that many across the Entente tuned into to hear. The King's hopeful words of encouragement to the soldiers and citizens alike, as well as frequent visits to the frontline, boosted our soldiers' morale. Once, a young monarch brought to prominence by unlikely circumstances; King George VI, came into his own. But the King faces his greatest challenge yet, as the figurehead now has to unify a divided people. Some in the Home Isles welcome the return of the King, but others don't feel any particular affection to their new ruler. Now, King George VI must support efforts to mark a new era of rebuilding and prosperous times in Britain."

GBR_central_banking_act:0 "Pass the Central Credit Act"
GBR_central_banking_act_desc:0 "One provision recommended by the Pigou Report has been to establish a system of interest-free credit offered by the central banks, and overseen by the government. These loans would allow private citizens to act as entrepeneurs, becoming a new class of business owner as we transfer control away from the labour unions. The idea is to avoid rampant inflation, but to apply a jolt of private enterprise to an economy which hasn't needed that for decades."
GBR_national_health_service:0 "The National Health Service"
GBR_national_health_service_desc:0 "Another recommendation of the Beveridge Report is that a system of free universal health care be established in Britain, under the guidance of the NHS. It will do a great deal to improve conditions in the country, as well as assuage those who still claim that life was better under syndicalist rule."
GBR_privatization_act:0 "Pass the Privatization Act"
GBR_privatization_act_desc:0 "With the desyndicalization process having been completed, now the government needs to undertake the process of reverting ownership of major companies from the unions back to private hands. Thanks to the Pigou Report, we have a system in place to make sure the process is fair, and a field of new entrepeneurs ready and funded by credit to take their place."
GBR_rent_control_act:0 "Pass the Rent Control Act"
GBR_rent_control_act_desc:0 "So long as there is a serious shortage of houses, rent control must exist. The establishment of Tribunals throughout the country to fix fair rents as between landlord and tenant (as recommended by the Ridley Committee) seems to provide the best solution of a long-standing problem."
GBR_progressive_reconciliation:0 "Reconcile the Left"
GBR_progressive_reconciliation_desc:0 "One major goal of the Labour Party is to make an appeal to all progressives in the country - we will pass several social reforms to earn their trust, so that they may be counted on to fight with Labour against any reactionary policies proposed by conservatives. Those who believe in socialist policies are not incompatible with Britain's new administration, and we must act as a protector to ensure they thrive just as any other citizen."
GBR_parliamentary_reform:0 "Parliamentary Reform"
GBR_parliamentary_reform_desc:0 "Our present system of voting produces Parliaments which are not representative of the people's will. A party with a minority of votes can secure a majority in the House of Commons. We must therefore reform the voting system so that voters can offer a list of preferential candidates, as well as ensure that elections do not favor the wealthy by putting the extra cost of campaigning upon the State."
GBR_female_equality:0 "Enact Female Equality in Britain"
GBR_female_equality_desc:0 "The family is the basis of our national life. Liberals were the first to demand family allowances and are determined to secure adequate provision for motherhood and child welfare. The Liberal Party demands for women equality of opportunity and status; it stands for equal pay for equal work, and for equal opportunity of entry into the public services."

GBR_fate_of_the_unions:0 "Fate of the Unions"
GBR_fate_of_the_unions_desc:0 "While syndicalism is gone, the United Kingdom is still left with a multitude of unions who have no idea where they stand. Are they dissolved? Is there to be no worker representation at all? The decision remains to be made."
GBR_fate_of_leaders:0 "Start the Trials"
GBR_fate_of_leaders_desc:0 "The fate of the unions is very separate from the union leadership - in particular, those people who ran the Union of Britain, and who made the decision to pit British soldiers against British soldiers. They must be put on trial, and their fate made an example of all those who would follow them."
GBR_question_of_labour:0 "The Question of Labour"
GBR_question_of_labour_desc:0 "One remaining question is regarding the fate of the Labour Party. Should it be allowed to campaign and field candidates for Parliament, or was the fact that it worked with the syndicalist authority enough of a betrayal that they can never be forgiven?"
GBR_returning_aristocracy:0 "The Returning Aristocracy"
GBR_returning_aristocracy_desc:0 "Many of the wealthier Exiles have returned to Britain - only to discover that their lands had been stripped, their businesses nationalized, and their homes now occupied by someone else. They want these things returned to them... but returning it to them now means stripping it from someone else."
GBR_reorganize_bureaucracy:0 "Reorganize the Bureaucracy"
GBR_reorganize_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The British government apparatus was stripped down and rebuilt, in order to work for a government that was entirely centered on trade unions and a powerful welfare state.

GBR_hold_elections:0 "Return to Free Government"

GBR_guided_parliament:0 "Guided Parliament"
GBR_guided_parliament_desc:0 "The BRA may come to realize that the United Kingdom is in too difficult a state, that the violence committed by the syndicalist supporters who yet remain is too extreme to return to civilian rule. Doing so would be condemning the country to a repeat of the last revolt."
GBR_absolute_monarchy:0 "Re-Assert the Royal Prerogative"
GBR_absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "While in Exile in Canada, King [CAN_king_first_name] exercised a great deal of power in the interest of stability, and as a result the Empire has never been in a better position to retake what was lost. It would be a shame to lose all that potential for glory in the interest of a document written 700 years ago. It is once again time to assert the King's God-given right to rule without any barriers to progress such as so-called 'democracy'."
GBR_end_of_bra:0 "Reconstruction Completed"
GBR_end_of_bra_desc:0 "While the BRA has been instrumental in bringing Britain back from the brink and restoring its pre-syndicalist legacy, its time is now at an end.

GBR_imperial_chemical:0 "The Imperial Chemical Deal"
GBR_imperial_chemical_desc:0 "To put it bluntly, the United Kingdom needs fuel - the lack is partly what brought down the syndicalists, and we will need to employ our contacts in the private sector to set up our future as a fuel producer rather than solely an importer."
GBR_regulate_growth:0 "Regulate Industrial Growth"
GBR_regulate_growth_desc:0 "If we're not careful, there are too many 'entrepreneurs' who will use the current state of the British economy as a way to gain power or exploit the British people.

GBR_marconi_deal:0 "The Marconi Deal"
GBR_marconi_deal_desc:0 "Marconi electronics is one of the largest companies still active in the United Kingdom.

This should boost the economy considerably."
GBR_arms_deal:0 "National Arms Deal"

uk.1.d:0 "After years of exile and struggle, the royal family has returned to the United Kingdom in triumph. It is a glorious day for Britain and the Empire, all of whom are thankful to [Root.GetNameDef] for its valiant service to the cause of tradition and world order. God save the King!"
uk.1.a:0 "Restore the United Kingdom! (Play as the UK)"
uk.1.b:0 "Restore the United Kingdom!"

uk.3.t:0 "The Restoration"
uk.3.d:0 "At long last, [CAN_king_full_name] entered Westminster Abbey today to be properly crowned as virtually all English and later British monarchs have been throughout history. Today is a glorious day, one that will mark a new beginning for the United Kingdom. After the coronation is over, however, the king and his government will find that the task of rebuilding the country is just beginning. The country's army is in a difficult position, with an organization that will need to be started over from scratch, the economy has been completely upended just as it was after the uprising, and the fate of Britain's former syndicalist rulers must be decided upon."
uk.3.a:0 "Long live the king!"

uk.4.t:0 "Liberty Day"
uk.4.d:0 "Across [Root.GetNameDef], stores and factories are closed as the British gather in a national day of remembrance in honour of those who lost their lives in the struggle against syndicalism. The central activities of the day occur in London where, on the anniversary of his death, the remains of George V have been interred in a special vault in an elaborate ceremony at Westminster Abbey, attended by King [CAN_king_first_name], the royal family, and leading political and military figures. This solemn act has finally fulfilled the late king's dying wish to return home. After the ceremony, King [CAN_king_first_name] led a procession to the east end of the Mall, where a monument to George V was unveiled. The king stated that the monument commemorated all those who had been victims of the former regime, and that never again would syndicalism threaten British liberty. To honour the victims of syndicalism, and keep fresh the memory of what had been so nearly lost and was so dearly regained, henceforth this day every year is to be celebrated as Liberty Day."
uk.4.a:0 "For King and Country!"

uk.5.t:0 "Liberty Day"
uk.5.d:0 "Across [Root.GetNameDef], stores and factories are closed, as the British gather on this national day of remembrance, in honour of those who lost their lives in the struggle against syndicalism. The central activities of the day occur in the capital where, attended by King [CAN_king_first_name], the royal family, and leading political and military figures, the Royal Guard parades through the city. In a speech given to the masses assembeld on the Mall, King [CAN_king_first_name] pledged that never again would syndicalism threaten British liberty, passed down through the ages. 'We honour the victims today,' he said, 'and keep fresh the memory of what had been so nearly lost and was so dearly regained.'"
uk.5.a:0 "For King and Country!"

uk.6.t:0 "The New British Army"
uk.6.d.canada:0 "With the restoration of the United Kingdom, a large number of British Exiles who had been drafted into the Canadian Army are now the first to return home - they have been assembled into a number of Home Guard units desperately needed to maintain order. Soon to follow them are the senior generals and admirals who have been serving in Canada up until now, all of whom are incredibly pleased to see the Home Isles once again."
uk.6.d.other:0 "With the restoration of the United Kingdom, a large number of British Exiles are now the first to return home - they have been assembled into a number of Home Guard units desperately needed to maintain order.

### The British Reconstruction Authority ###
uk.10.t:0 "Reconstruction Authority Announced"
uk.10.d:0 "While the monarchy has been restored to the British Isles, many policy-makers feel that the country needs to undergo a difficult 'de-syndicalization' process. Syndicalist rule permeated deep into British culture and society, as well as the economy, so that must be rebuilt along with the many homes that were laid waste during the war. On the steps of the damaged Westerminster Parliament, Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] announced to a hopefuly but not enthusiastic crowd that the BRA, or British Reconstruction Authority, had been created and granted broad governing powers to see the rejuvenation process done as swiftly as possible."
uk.10.a:0 "Let us hope it works!"

uk.11.t:0 "Exiles Encounter Resistance"
uk.11.d:0 "Those British citizens who fled the United Kingdom after it fell to syndicalist rule, or 'the Exiles', have encountered increasing resistance now as they begin to return to the country in large numbers. Disputes over the ownership of homes and estates which had been abandoned are frequent, and resentment towards the wealthier Exiles who return 'untouched by war and poverty' has become the norm. King [CAN_king_first_name] launched a radio appeal to the British people, reminding them that the Exiles are the very reason their freedom has been regained - they are not returning conquerors, but as lost lambs brought back into the flock. Even so, many believe it will take many years to heal the social divide between these two groups."
uk.11.a:0 "Worrying"

uk.12.t:0 "Syndicalist Militias Remain Active"
uk.12.d:0 "While there is a feeling among most Britons that the war is over, and their willingness to fight has been exhausted, there remain a number of syndicalist militia groups that are still active - they remain hidden both in the northern foothills and buried deep within the United Kingdom's larger urban areas. Militia leaders are reportedly trying to stoke resistance against King [CAN_king_first_name] and the 'tyrannical Reconstruction Authority', and while they have met with very limited success so far it can only get worse if the BRA takes actions that anger socialists once more."
uk.12.a:0 "We will need to move carefully"

uk.13.t:0 "Union Soldiers Return"
uk.13.d:0 "Now that the war is done, surviving soldiers who fought for the Union of Britain have begun to trickle back into the cities - some still injured, but most simply fearful that they will suffer repercussions for something they had no control over. Many are looking to re-enlist into the military, though the British Army is by no means ready to accept them just yet. Even so, should these men be treated as veterans? That will mean treating their injuries and providing them with stipends. A large number of Britons have sympathy for them... but these were also the same men who, until just recently, were killing their own countrymen for the syndicalists. Should that be rewarded?"
uk.13.a:0 "We won't support traitors"
uk.13.b:0 "They'll receive limited help, but no stipend"
uk.13.c:0 "They were only doing as they were told - give them full support"

uk.14.t:0 "Exile Relief Efforts Begin"
uk.14.d:0 "While Britons may not yet be grateful for their presence, the returning Exiles are undoubtedly in the best position to offer relief to those in the United Kingdom who have been left ravaged by the war. Lord Mountbatten has led the way, spending millions of his own funds to set up a homeless relief shelter in the heart of Manchester and Liverpool, and has called on his fellow Exiles to follow suit. Soup kitchens and tent cities have sprung up from one end of the country to the next, some government-funded by many underwritten by the wealthiest Exiles - most of whom have expressed, like Lord Mountbatten, that it is their duty to help those who had been left behind."
uk.14.a:0 "A welcome sight"

uk.15.t:0 "British Bankruptcies Increase"
uk.15.d:0 "Vauxhall Motors Limited closed the doors on its Luton headquarters today, making it the third major bankruptcy declaration since the creation of the BRA. Most of these large companies had transfered over to union ownership during British rule, and with the future of unions in serious question it has left these companies in a state of limbo and without leadership. The BRA is preparing to step in and seize temporary ownership of corporations that threaten to close in this manner, though doing would still leave them in a state where their production is in a standstill. If the situation is not resolved soon, British unemployment levels could reach record heights within months."
uk.15.a:0 "This is not good..."

uk.16.t:0 "The BRA Begins Operation"
uk.16.d:0 "With Parliament itself restored, Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] - standing next to King [CAN_king_first_name] - stood on its steps to announce that the British Reconstruction Authority was officially underway. Members of Parliament were already streaming into the building for their first session, where discussions would be held on the emergency lifting of import restrictions, and there was a definite feeling among the large crowd that things were soon going to return to normal. A few protestors holding union signs disturbed the ceremony only briefly before being led away by policemen."

With loan restrictions loosened or outright ignored, the construction companies have been able to hire on many thousands of eager workers and begin the process of restoring homes to Britain's teeming numbers of homeless families. As the first houses had their frames put up, cheering watchers said it was the first real feeling of hope they've experienced in many months."

uk.18.d:0 "While most of the Union of Britain's syndicalist leadership have either gone into hiding or, as with Oswald Mosley, fled the country entirely, Arthur Horner today appeared and surrendered himself to British police. Even though he knew this would mean being placed on trial, he said 'I cannot in good conscience abandon my socialist brothers and sisters. We may have lost the war, but the battle is still being fought for workers everywhere. If they are to be put on trial for their ongoing fight against oppression, then so shall I.' Horner's supporters turned up in large numbers to silently watch him being led to prison. His actions appear to have stirred up syndicalist support which had been thought withered away by the end of the war."

Import restrictions have been removed, and already British supermarkets are seeing the return of meats and cheeses and fruits that all but vanished since syndicalist rule began. For many Britons, even though many still have their meals funded by the government, this is a sign that things are substantially improving."

uk.21.t:0 "Fate of the Unions"
uk.21.d:0 "The defeat of the Union of Britain brought with it the destruction of the old trade unions that had supported the syndicalist regime. However, there is still the question of whether British workers should be allowed to organise on a local basis to defend their interests - indeed, there is an entire infrastructure of labour groups ready and waiting to begin setting up unions once again, and merely waiting to see what the government considers 'acceptable' now. Banning them entirely will not go over well with these groups, to say the least. One argument is that the government should set up a small number of controlled unions, and ban the rest. Still others say that the unions aren't the problem, and trying to get rid of them now will only invite disaster."

While this is easily the lightest requirement the United Kingdom could apply, there have still been a number of protests over the matter in Scotland and Wales, with hardline labour activists saying that this was a 'slippery path' towards government keeping their foot on labour's neck for the rest of time.

Horner's trial has received considerable attention in the British media, and he's spoken eloquently about the need for Britain 'to come to terms with its history of labour but also its future'. Indeed, there are some who regret giving him the platform at all, as he seems to have gained many sympathizers. Some policy-makers suggest that these trials are best used to make examples of traitors, but others say that harsh penalties will only enflame the resistance further."

That the sentences handed out were fairly light seems to have taken the heat out of things, but even so these protests say the trials should not have begun in the first place. 'There is nothing they should apologize for!' read the signs. British police kept a close eye on the protests, though they did not escalate into violence."

A riot outside the courtroom needed to be put down almost immediately, but even after it was suppressed the night exploded into more violence when a bomb went off at the Old Bailey. As the seat of the Crown Court, the Old Bailey is a symbol of the King's justice, and the symbolism of the bombing has been lost on no-one. Thankfully, the building was mostly empty at the time of the explosion, and few were injured."

Clement Attlee has presented himself in Parliament to make the case for the party, saying that while it did cooperate with the syndicalist government it also didn't have much choice. The Labour Party was never in a position of power in the Union of Britain, he says, and all it could do was to try and make things easier for the average citizen. The labour movement itself should not be punished. There are those who question Attlee's motives, and suggest that his personal collaboration with the Union is in itself criminal, but it's also clear that Labour has a huge amount of support. Banning it would prove difficult."

Clement Attlee has presented himself in Parliament to make the case for the party, though there are some who question why he was not placed under arrest. The Labour Party was in power in the Union of Britain, however briefly, and thus gave orders that led to the death of British citizens. Attlee claims that the party was simply doing its best in a difficult situation... and many British citizens agree. The Labour Party has a large amount of approval.

The problem, of course, is that the new occupants assumed ownership legally, according to the Union of Britain, so they say having their homes now stripped from them is unfair. There is a simmering resentment against the aristocracy who fled after the uprising in 1925, which is feeding into this growing conflict, and now the government is being called in to decide the matter once and for all."

Most important in this step is monetary reform, including the establishment of a new system of interest-free credit issues through a new government banking agency.

That was a treaty with the Irish Free State, however, a country which was a member of the British Empire and Commonwealth... a title that the Irish gave up when they declared in the republic in 1925. With the United Kingdom restored to the Home Isles, the question had remained whether the British would pursue their claim on Northern Ireland once again, a question that has finally been answered in the firm negative. This means not only peace with the Irish, but a change of name and flag for the United Kingdom as it one again becomes the Kingdom of Great Britain."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_BASARIA_DESC: "Simon Basaria, the leader of the Abkhaz People's Council in 1917-1918, and, again, now, is a prominent ethnographer, regional specialist and teacher. Born in a peasant Abkhaz family, he is nevertheless a person of highest culture, a highly professional specialist, champion of progress, Enlightenment and liberal-democratic ideas.\n\nHe was greatly opposed to an idea of Abkhaz pro-Georgian orientation in 1917. He was the person, who became the first leader of the People's Council of Abkhazia and who declared Abkhazia an independent territory. He saw the political development of Abkhazia in a cooperative unity with other North Caucasian Peoples. With a declaration to join the Mountain Republic, the fate of Abkhazia seemed to be determined, until eventually Basaria was overthrown as a leader of NSA, and the pro-Georgian faction won.\n\nNow, Basaria has decided to lead the Abkhaz Insurgency and finally decide its fate as either a North Caucasian consistent entity, or at least as an independent nation under the protection of Ottomans."
POLITICS_ALEKS_CHACHBA_DESC: "Aleksandr Sharvashidze-Chachba, the locum tenens of the Abkhazian throne since 1918 was never raised to become a king. While nominally a Prince of Abkhazia, he lived his life as a talanted painter, being square with such outstanding artists as Valentin Serov, Nicholas Roerich and even Pablo Pikasso. He was described as a living embodiment of chivalrous gallantry, a descendant of Abkhaz Kings. During the Revolution, he had to flee Sukhum to Baku, where he designed the Azerbaijan coat of arms, later travelling to Crimea, and finally settling down in London, where he worked together with Sergei Diaghilev for the Ballets Russes. Eventually forced to flee again in 1925 due to the British Revolution, the multiple stays of Prince Sharvashidze ended in Berlin, until, over 10 years later, he returned to Menshevist Sukhum.\n\nThe Abkhaz Insurgency walked in on him, together with Basaria's proposal to restore the throne of Abkhazian kings, and there's no other candidacy better, than Aleksandr. Though becoming a constitutional monarch, with all power in the hands of NSA, Aleksandr is the main face of Abkhazia now, no matter if he wants it or not."
POLITICS_EMUKHVARI_DESC: "Arzakan Emukhvari was born in an Orthodox Abkhaz family, despite his clear pro-Georgian stance. He became a member of RSDRP in 1902 and during 1905 Revolution he became a head of the Sukhum Republic. He was eventually arrested and detained for 1 years, thanks to the help of his influential relatives.\n\nDue to his arrest and revolutionary activities, he gained a lot of respect in Abkhazia. In 1917, he became the leader of pro-Georgian faction of politicians in Sukhum District. His democratic movement with slogans 'Unite With Georgia, Not With North Caucasus" was becoming more and more influential. Due to his efforts, he was elected the Chairman of the Abkhaz People's Council and in March 1919 Abkhazia joined Georgia as an autonomy.\n\nAfter the war he remained the head of Abkhaz Autonomy Government, thankfully due to the large Georgian population, his reputation among the Abkhaz and overall great authority of the Mensheviks in the region."
POLITICS_LAKOBA_DESC: "Nestor Lakoba became well known in Abkhazia as a person of great influence. Born in a poor peasant family in Lykhny, Lakoba finished the Tiflis ecclesiastical academy and seminary, similar to the other Abkhaz Intelligentsia representatives. He soon became acquainted with Bolsheviks and joined their faction of the RSDRP. With his unconquerable temper, he became very influential among both Georgian and Abkhaz revolutionaries.\nDuring 1917-1920 he was unlucky to seize power in the region, and with the Bolshevik ultimate failure, the communist movement in Abkhazia was doomed. Being arrested for anti-Georgian activities, Lakoba, thankfully, got loose and was elected to the Abkhaz Autonomy Government from the opposition. Because of him, Abkhazia managed to get some attention from the central government and managed to develop a bit, gaining him even more support as a staunch critic of Georgian authorities and a true Abkhaz patriot.\n\nBeing hearing-impaired, he still is a strong man with a virile character, who will do everything to ensure Abkhaz independence from Georgia. A leader of Kiaraz (Mutual Support) military formation together with his fellow counterparts, Lakoba dreams of establishing a socialist, independent Abkhazia. However, with his influence nearly undisputed, it is possible that Lakoba can use it in his own favour."

### Events ###
abk.1.t: "History of Abkhazia"
abk.1.d: "Abkhazia, or as the Abkhaz themselves call their country, Apsny, is a region located on the northeast coast of the Black Sea, inhabited since ancient times.\n\nAlready in the 8th century an independent church of Abkhazia was formed, and in the 15th century as a result of the collapse of the united Georgian kingdom the Principality of Abkhazia appeared on the world map. Caught under the vassalage of the Ottoman Empire, the principality under the rule of the Shervashidze-Chachba dynasty was converted to Islam, though not completely. Rebellions of Abkhazians against the power of the empire continued until, finally, in 1866, the Principality of Abkhazia was abolished and annexed to Russia, and the last rebellion was suppressed.\n\nImmediately after the February Revolution of 1917 power in Sukhumi was in the hands of the Abkhaz People's Council led by Simon Basaria. However, he and his companions failed to lobby for joining of Abkhazia to the newly formed Federation of Mountainous Republic and soon Basaria was dismissed and power in Abkhazia passed into the hands of the Mensheviks. By signing a treaty on accession to Georgia within the framework of autonomy, the Abkhaz People's Council thus completed a short period of albeit largely nominal independence."
abk.1.a: "Interesting"
abk.1.b: "Who is struggling for power?"

abk.2.t: "Politics of Abkhazia"
abk.2.d: "For the time being, power in Abkhazia has returned to the Abkhaz People's Council, first dispersed by separatists and then restored under the leadership of Simon Basaria. Thus, the Abkhaz People's Council seeks the complete separation of Abkhazia from Georgia and possible accession to the Mountain Republic as an equal state.\n\nOn the other hand, they are opposed by the Social Democratic Party of Abkhazia led by Varlam Shervashidze, a pro-Georgian Menshevik Abkhazian who has no intention of submitting to the Abkhaz minority. If Simon Basaria intends to hold a Constituent Assembly, the SDPA elected by Georgians and pro-Georgian Abkhazians will certainly have a majority in it.\n\nFinally, the third party in the small republic is the armed formations of Kiaraz Nestor Lakoba, a Bolshevik and patriot of Abkhazia, who is very popular among the Abkhaz as a man who achieved many reforms for the Abkhaz during Georgian rule."
abk.2.a: "So many sides in such a small region!"

abk.3.t: "Sochi Pro-Russian Rally"
abk.3.d: "With the outbreak of hostilities, political life intensified not only in Abkhazia but also in Sochi, a small seaside town in the north of the country, which had been seized during the Georgian offensive against the Kuban in 1918. Sochi is dominated by Russian and Russian-speaking population, which has been deprived of any support as a minority from Georgia all these years, and now among them there are growing separatist sentiments towards both Georgia and us.\n\nPro-Russian rallies were held in Adler and Sochi calling for secession from Abkhazia, or at least demanding autonomy for Russians from our government. On the one hand, we can make concessions to them, hoping for appeasement. On the other hand, we are building Abkhazia and there should be no compromises with the Russians! "
abk.3.a: "Promise them autonomy and make sure they are on our side."
abk.3.b: "Do nothing - who cares?"

abk.4.t: "The Muhajir Return From Turkey!"
abk.4.d: "The Muhajir movement emerged as a protest against Russification, Georgification and other imperialist actions aimed at enslaving the Abkhaz people. As a result, many Abkhaz Muslims left their native land for a life among co-religionists in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nWith the outbreak of hostilities, many of them followed the call and began returning to their native Abkhazia to fight for its greatness and historical justice.\n\nAlthough the influx of Abkhazians back to their homeland cannot but please us, their predominantly Islamic faith may aggravate interethnic and interreligious conflicts in the country."
abk.4.a: "We are glad they are coming to fight!"

abk.5.t: "A Call to Ottomans"
abk.5.d: "The Ottoman Empire has been our master for a long time, but they have strategical reasons to be hostile to Georgia. We should ask them for help, and hopefully, this will make Georgia sit down and negotiate."
abk.5.a: "Let us hope they agree."

abk.6.t: "Abkhazia Requests Mediation"
abk.6.d: "The small region of Abkhazia is now controlled by the separatist pro-[ROOT.GetAdjective] and pro-[MTR.GetAdjective] forces, under the lead of Simon Basaria. With their conflict with Georgian government resulting in an open armed confrontation, they have asked our government for support and official mediation of the conflict."

abk.9.t: "Germany Acts a Georgia's Mediatior"
abk.9.d: "The German Empire has responded to the Georgian call for help and now acts as Georgia's mediator and clearly on their side. While Caucasus has long been a stumbling block in our relations with the Germans, they go on with their support for Georgia. How shall we react?"

abk.11.t: "Germany and Ottomans Demand Armistice"
abk.11.d: "The German and Ottoman delegations are now pressuring us to sign an armistice with the separatists. While even our talks with Abkhaz rebels can be later used as a proof that we recognize them, moreover, the Abkhaz can use this time to better prepare their separatist troops."

abk.16.t: "Abkhazia Insists On Independence"
abk.16.d: "Abkhazia has insisted on recognition of their independence. While the separatists grow stronger and get support, we have less chances to successfully seize it. However, there are some thoughts among the government what we shall ask in return."

abk.17.t: "Georgian Plans on Batumi"

abk.39.t: "Ankara Agreements"
abk.39.d: "After brief negotiations and meetings, the parties presented their demands, and a treaty was drawn up for all four countries to sign.\n1. [ABK.GetNameDefCap] is recognized as an independent and sovereign republic by all the signatories.\n2. [ABK.GetNameDefCap] is recognized within the borders of the former autonomous republic of Abkhazia within [GEO.GetNameDefCap]\n3. [TUR.GetNameDefCap] must provide guarantees for the territorial integrity and security of [ABK.GetNameDefCap].\n4. [GEO.GetNameDefCap] should demilitarize the region of Samurzakano between the rivers Kialasur and Ingur."

abk.40.t: "Georgia Leaves Negotiations!"
abk.40.d: "The Georgians have refused the terms and any further negotiations. With their delegation returning to Tbilisi, their forces resume their attack on the Abkhaz region!"
abk.40.a: "The war rages on."

abk.41.t: "Abkhazia Leaves Negotiations!"
abk.41.d: "The Abkhaz delegation has refused the terms and any further negotiations. With their delegation returning to Sukhum, their forces resume their defence against the Georgian government."

abk.46.t: "[FROM.GetName] Wishes to Join Our Alliance"
abk.46.d: "Our proletarian comrades in the Caucasus, [FROM.GetNameDefCap] have approached our government with desire to join our worldwide alliance. How shall we react?"
abk.46.a: "Let them in!"
abk.46.b: "No."

abk.47.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
abk.47.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our membership in their alliance."
abk.47.a: "They are the truly traitors of socialism!"

abk.50.t: "Georgian Industries Seized!"
abk.50.d: "With the war raging on, we have made sure that the Georgian-owned industries work for us, not for our enemies. With our forces controlling most of our land, we have expropriated any medium or large-sized industries that belonged to our enemies."
abk.50.a: "They have taken our freedom, we will take their factories!"

abk.51.t: "SDPA Calls For Elections!"
abk.51.d: "The Social Democratic Party of Abkhazia, a branch of Georgian Menshevik party has been ruling over our lands for too long. Even though they are supported by the Georgian majority, most of its leaders are of Abkhaz origin. With the armistice finally signed, the SDPA has called for new elections, claiming that Basaria had no right to seize power!"
abk.51.a: "The elections to the Council should go smooth."

abk.52.t: "Myrzakan Polls Show SDPA Confident Victory"
abk.52.d: "The region of Myrzakan, right along the border with Georgia is controlled by a significant Georgian majority with strong integration sentiments. Recent polls show that the whole region will vote for the SDPA, and it can really make them a majority after the Council is re-elected."
abk.52.a: "That's not too bad."

abk.53.t: "Lakoba Rallies Support in Kodor"
abk.53.d: "Nestor Lakoba, a prominent socialist leader of Abkhazia has recently rallied support in the poor villages of Kodor Valley in Myrzakan. While earlier it was considered that SDPA will likely win in the region, it is now challenged by rather popular Kiaraz."
abk.53.a: "The Bolshevik victory in Kodor is more than likely."

abk.54.t: "Georgian Participation in Elections?"
abk.54.d: "After we have faced war with Georgia, the chauvinist sentiments are ruling in the society with the Abkhaz minority fearing that the Georgian majority will ensure a pro-Georgian victory in the elections. Even though the decision to ban Georgians from voting in the Constituent Assembly of Abkhazia was long in the minds of our politicians, it is a dangerous step that can lead to escalation. Moreover, if we ban the majority from participating in election, we will secure our power by really undemocratic means - a dangerous step to take."
abk.54.a: "We should not allow Georgians to participate."
abk.54.b: "We should respect Abkhaz democratic traditions."

abk.55.t: "Week Before Elections"
abk.55.d: "The time has always come. With the elections concluding in a week, it is our last chance to raise some support for our candidates. However, we cannot spare much resources and therefore choose a region where we can rally support."
abk.55.a: "Focus on raising support in Sukhum."
abk.55.b: "Focus on raising support in Myrzakan."
abk.55.c: "Focus on raising support in Kodor."

abk.56.t: "The Kingdom Restoration?"
abk.56.d: "While Basaria was getting ready for the elections, a sudden idea has came up to his mind as he got to know that Prince Aleksandr Sharvashidze-Chachba, from the noble family and locum tenens of the Abkhazian Crown was back in Sukhum. Despite Aleksandr is a well-known artist, who worked with Diaghilev and designed Azerbaijani coat of arms, he can be proclaimed the constitutional monarch. Such decision will probably give Basaria and his faction a lot of people's support and at least the great Kingdom of Abkhazia, that has disappeared centuries ago would be back on the map."
abk.56.a: "Announce restoration!"
abk.56.b: "Constituent Assembly should decide."

abk.57.t: "Constituent Assembly Elections!"
abk.57.d: "The elections have concluded and all the votes have been counted. It is time for the new body to announce who has won the majority of the mandates."
abk.57.a: "Basaria is re-elected!"
abk.57.b: "SDPA's landslide victory!"
abk.57.c: "Lakoba's Kiaraz wins the mandate!"

abk.58.t: "Menshevik Abkhazia"
abk.58.d: "The SDPA has proven to be Abkhazia's largest and strongest political party. Without any doubt, Mensheviks have once again won elections and will now look forward towards uniting back to Georgia, causing a lot of anger among the Abkhaz minority."
abk.58.a: "A truly democratic Abkhazia!"

abk.59.t: "The Kingdom Restoration?"
abk.59.d: "With the election on the new Constituent Assembly, almost the first issue raised at the convocation by Basaria's faction was the restoration of the Abkhazian crown. While all other factions in the Assembly are radically opposed to the idea of Kingdom, with the majority of Basaria's supporters elected, it is likely that this suggestion will be passed."
abk.59.a: "Aleksandr Sharvashidze-Chachba will become the new King!"
abk.59.b: "The Constituent Assembly votes against restoration."

abk.60.t: "Re-Election of Abkhazia Premier"
abk.60.d: "With the SDPA elected, the question who will lead the 'Sokhumi District' as the SDPA officially calls Abkhazia has arisen. The first choice is Varlam Shervashidze, a notable leader of the faction, a famous doctor. The other choice is Arzakan Emukhvari, from a noble Abkhaz family, though with pro-Georgian stance, known for being that man who signed the treaty of unification with Georgia."
abk.60.a: "Varlam Shervashidze."
abk.60.b: "Arzakan Emukhvari."

abk.61.t: "Kiaraz Self-Coup"
abk.61.d: "With the Kiaraz sudden victory in the Constituent Assembly, Nestor Lakoba and Efrem Eshba has taken the reigns of power only to self-coup a few days later. They have dissolved the Assembly due to its bourgeouis nature and proclaimed the Soviet Republic of Abkhazia and dictatorship of Abkhaz peasants and workers, represented by their revolutionary organisation."
abk.61.a: "Nestor Lakoba leads Abkhazia!"

abk.62.t: "Basaria Leads Monarchist Putsch"
abk.62.d: "With the elections to the Constituent Assembly concluded, not everyone had agreed with the results. Furious of the rigged elections, Basaria has rallied his supporters and loyal militia and has introduced the troops to the city, dismantling the Assembly and proclaiming the restoration of the Kingdom. In his sudden monarchist putsch nobody could resist and so Basaria has secured his power."
abk.62.a: "Long live the King!"

abk.63.t: "Chachba Restoration!"
abk.63.d: "Prince Aleksandr has entered the room, where the people have gathered and awaited for his speech. The locum tenens of the Abkhazian crown was always a mere formality to him, as he never chose it and has never expected to become a successor to the Abkhazian Throne, as his father was the youngest son of the last Abkhazian Prince, which made him one of the most unexpected heirs. Nevertheless, in 1918, following the death of his cousin Giorgi II, Aleksandr became the locum tenens of the Abkhazian throne, just as the Civil War has raged on in all parts of former Russian Empire.\n\nNow, standing before the people, despite his unwillingness to become head of state, Aleksandr has delivered a speech full of hopes and relief, and his people has listened with joy to the new King."
abk.63.a: "Long live the King!"

abk.64.t: "Kiaraz Coups Basaria!"
abk.64.d: "Basaria has underestimated the power and authority of Lakoba and his Kiaraz. With the support of peasants all over Abkhazia, the Kiaraz has announced that the elections were rigged and that Basaria is looking forward to another enslavement of the Abkhaz people, just not by the Georgians. With Lakoba's successful rally in Sukhum and his great popularity among the common people, he has managed to seize power in Abkhazia, proclaiming the Soviet Republic."
abk.64.a: "Nestor Lakoba leads Abkhazia!"

abk.65.t: "National Guard Overthrows the Mensheviks!"
abk.65.d: "With the SDPA's sudden victory in the Assembly, the people of Abkhazia shall stand no other Georgian occupation, as Basaria has stated. With the introduction of the National Guard to Sukhum, Simon Basaria has dissolved the assembly forcefully and proclaimed that the army will stabilize the situation and Abkhazia shall never be Georgia again!"
abk.65.a: "Never another 1919!"

abk.66.t: "National Guard Overthrows the Bolsheviks!"
abk.66.d: "With the Kiaraz's sudden victory in the Assembly, the people of Abkhazia shall stand no Bolshevism, as Basaria has stated. With the introduction of the National Guard to Sukhum, Simon Basaria has dissolved the assembly forcefully and arrested Lakoba and Eshba, proclaiming that the army will stabilize the situation and Abkhazia shall never fall to Bolshevism."
abk.66.a: "Never another 1918!"

abk.67.t: "Kiaraz Coups Mensheviks!"
abk.67.d: "With the SDPA's sudden victory in the Assembly, the people of Abkhazia shall stand no other Georgian occupation, as Lakoba has stated. With the introduction of militia and Kiaraz to Sukhum, Nestor Lakoba has dissolved the assembly forcefully and arrested Emukhvari, proclaiming that the new Soviet Regime will stabilize the situation and Abkhazia shall never be Georgia again."
abk.67.a: "Nestor Lakoba leads Abkhazia!"

abk.70.t: "A State For Abkhaz!"
abk.70.d: "The new direction, chosen by Nestor Lakoba, has turned Abkhazia away from path of rootless cosmopolitans and vain internationalism and directed towards a state, built on patriotism, nationalism and self-esteem. With Lakoba placing primary emphasis upon Abkhazia's stength and self-reliance, there will be finally a chance for the Abkhaz people to revive their culture and history and create a small, but sovereign and powerful state."
abk.70.a: "The Georgians will be outraged."

abk.71.t: "Abkhaz Princely Aristocracy"
abk.71.d: "With the history of our land closely tied to the various noble houses and families, that still exist, it will be of much incaution to purge them or somehow change their way of living. Instead, Lakoba seeks to appease the nobility and make them accept his authority and rule as the only one possible for Abkhazia to survive. With the Kiaraz's security services, however, suggesting a second way: make an ultimatum to all reactionary families and either make them flee or face being arrested."
abk.71.a: "They should make oath to Lakoba!"
abk.71.b: "Give them a choice: flee or be arrested."

abk.72.t: "Abkhaz Culture Prospers!"
abk.72.d: "Thanks to our great leader's orders to invest large sums of money into revival of Abkhaz culture, a lot of talented artists and writers have already appeared on the nation-wide stage, presenting their works of art to the common public and winning plenty of state awards. With [ROOT.GetLeader]'s investments, the education level and cultural development has greatly improved."
abk.72.a: "Glory to our great people!"

abk.73.t: "Abkhaz Socialism"
abk.73.d: "With Lakoba's reforms, Abkhazia has already improved its cultural, social and economic situation and is moving towards more prosperity. The special reforms, introduced by Lakoba with a deep love and understanding of his people have made him a 'revisionist' in the eyes of Orthodox Marxists, even though they don't understand Abkhaz culture as Lakoba does. The special brand of Lakoba's socialist practices in Abkhazia have already received a colloquial name of Lakobism or Lakobist Socialism, which means accepting private property and multiple forms of land tenure, as well as some kind of national culture development and overall intolerance to wider Internationalism. Some ministers in the People's Government even suggest to our great leader to write a book about his success and they promise that it will be even greater than Marx's Das Kapital in a few years."
abk.73.a: "Hopefully, Lakoba will publish a book, greater than Kapital!"

abk.74.t: "Lakoba's Abkhazia"
abk.74.d: "While the enemies of Abkhazia and other people, jealous of Lakoba's success, call our country 'Lakobistan' in order to mock our great leader and his policies, their pathetic voices are not heard neither in Sukhum nor in Gagra. The only voice heard is the voice of our great leader Lakoba, even, as he likes to joke, 'I don't hear well myself, but the others hear only me.'\n\nWith the success of Abkhazia and Lakoba's socialism, a new era has opened for Abkhazia - an era of international relations. And the first and foremost problem is our neighbours in Tbilisi, which don't recognize us as independent nation. Our aim is now to decide what to do next, considering the Georgians."
abk.74.a: "We shall find peace with our Georgian friends."
abk.74.b: "We must restore Abkhaz Kingdom 9th Century Borders!"
abk.74.c: "Unite Georgia and Abkhazia into a single socialist republic!"

abk.75.t: "Efrem Eshba Protests Lakoba's Decision"
abk.75.d: "One of the notable Kiaraz leaders throughout the decades, Efrem Eshba, has protested Lakoba's decision to move away from some Communist principles, as the new republic has slowly emerged towards nationalism and social-patriotism. Claiming that the true salvation of the Abkhaz people lies in Internationalism, Eshba has now entered a conflict with the government and it is Lakoba's choice whether his life-long ally should leave his office."
abk.75.a: "He will eventually understand this decision."
abk.75.b: "I'm sorry, Efrem, but you should leave."

abk.76.t: "Efrem Eshba Leads the Opposition!"
abk.76.d: "With the forced resignation of Eshba from the people's government, he now decided to rally the other 'Communist' supporters in the Kiaraz and now leads the opposition to Lakoba's rule, which Eshba calls 'authoritarian' and 'nationalistic'. While we can allow discussion to some degree, Eshba's activites show that he is probably not really sane, if he can criticize our great leader and his policies."
abk.76.a: "Traitor!"

abk.77.t: "[FROM.GetName] Proposes Unification"
abk.77.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a suggestion of uniting our two governments into a single republic of Georgia-Abkhazia with equal representation and rights of Abkhaz and Georgian peoples. With everything separate, the main plan of the confederation is to have a common foreign policy, which Abkhaz leader Lakoba believes to be committment to World Internationalism."
abk.77.a: "Equal rights with some separatist minority? Ridiculuos."
abk.77.b: "We'd better unite our forces!"

abk.78.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"
abk.78.d: "Surprisingly, the [FROM.GetAdjective] governmenth as agreed to form a socialist confederation with us!"
abk.78.a: "Glory to Peace! Glory to Internationalism! Glory to LAKOBA!"

abk.79.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
abk.79.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused unification."
abk.79.a: "Declare war on this revisionists!"
abk.79.b: "We seek peace, not war."

abk.80.t: "First Lady of Abkhazia"
abk.80.d: "Saria is a woman of rare beauty - a slender brunette with big brown velvet eyes that radiated kindness and a charming smile. Her voice was soft and melodious, her gait is light. She is distinguished by her masculine, strong-willed character as well as by her elegance and fine taste. She has many jewels, mostly gifts from her brothers, but she never flaunted them, considering it bad form. The other government ladies only try to imitate her, but no other Abkhaz woman can be better than her\n\nOur First Lady, wife of our Great Vozhd Nestor Lakoba, Saria Lakoba, is highly respected, knowing that she could always give the right advice. And with our regime stabilized, Nestor, knowing that his wife is not only a good example for Abkhaz women, but also a beauty, has suggested to make her a foreign minister - to represent the great Abkhaz nation abroad, a position, that every other Abkhaz man or woman can only dream of. The reason is that his rule is truly democratic and he can't be foreign minister and head of government at the same time. That is why he though, that Saria is the best person that can succeed him in this position."
abk.80.a: "First lady should be our main foreign representative!"
abk.80.b: "We should not build our socialist state on nepotism!"

abk.81.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks For Protection"
abk.81.d: "The small country "
abk.81.a: "Sure!"
abk.81.b: "They should become a kingdom within the Empire!"
abk.81.c: "We don't need confrontation with Russia."

abk.82.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
abk.82.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has unfortunately declined our offer, perhaps, they are afraid of potential confrontation with Russia."
abk.82.a: "It seems we should find better partners."

abk.83.t: "[FROM.GetName] Suggests Our Subjugation"
abk.83.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has considered our offer, but in turn they demand that we become an autonomous kingdom under within their empire!"
abk.83.a: "Sure!"
abk.83.b: "We should not lose our sovereignity, even if they are our brothers."

abk.84.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
abk.84.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has willingly accepted our offer, providing us with the protection we asked for."
abk.84.a: "Splendid!"

abk.85.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused Our Offer"
abk.85.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer, stating that we should respect their sovereignity."
abk.85.a: "Provide them with what they wanted."
abk.85.b: "That is their right."

abk.86.t: "[FROM.GetName] Wants To Become Our Autonomy!"
abk.86.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a suggestion to join our federation, but with a special status so that they have full authority over their region, but they delegate foreign policy to us."
abk.86.a: "All republics should be equal."
abk.86.b: "That's better than nothing. Agreed!"

abk.87.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Equal Terms"
abk.87.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has stated that all republic within the federation are equal, and therefore, they cannot guarantee us a specific status. Instead, they suggested that we join them as an equal autonomous republic."
abk.87.a: "That means we will lose our sovereignity."
abk.87.b: "We agree!"

abk.88.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
abk.88.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to accept us into their family. Basaria's dream is finally realized!"
abk.88.a: "Splendid!"

abk.89.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
abk.89.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] refused to join us and become one of the autonomous republic. However, we had our claims on Abkhazia for too long - perhaps we can insist on their subjugation?"
abk.89.a: "Install friendly relations instead."
abk.89.b: "Declare war on them!"

abk.90.t: "Close Ties With [FROM.GetName]?"
abk.90.d: "Despite our refusal, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has offered us to install friendly relations."
abk.90.a: "Great!"
abk.90.b: "No."

abk.91.t: "Investments in [FROM.GetName]?"
abk.91.d: "A small nation of [FROM.GetName] is struggling with its economy due to long years of desolation, caused by Georgian authorities. They now ask if they are willing to invest in their economy in order to make their country be more tourist-oriented."
abk.91.a: "They have beautiful beaches, after all."
abk.91.b: "No."

abk.92.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
abk.92.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to invest to revive our economy."
abk.92.a: "Great!"

abk.93.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
abk.93.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused investing in our economy!"
abk.93.a: "Unfortunately."

abk.94.t: "Native Apkhazetis Georgians Forced to Flee!"
abk.94.d: "Due to inhumane nature of the Apkhazetis separatists, they are now forcing the majority of the region's population, the Georgians, to flee their homes! We are now approaching a migration crisis, since Georgians from Sokhumi district leave en-masse and are struggling to find their new homes."
abk.94.a: "[FROM.GetLeader] will pay for this!"

abk.95.t: "Helping the Abkhaz with Equipment?"
abk.95.d: "The Abkhazians are now struggling with the equipment, since they don't have any serious arms factories and have asked our government if we are willing to send them some of our old rifles to help in their war for independence."
abk.95.a: "Sure we will help!"
abk.95.b: "We don't have much..."

abk.96.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Rifles Arrive!"
abk.96.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has secretly set us a lot of equipment to help in our struggle."
abk.96.a: "We have more chances now!"

abk.97.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
abk.97.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has betrayed us and refused to send any military equipment."
abk.97.a: "That's bad."

abk.98.t: "Question of Afro-Abkhaz Minority"
abk.98.d: "With the news spreading all across Sokhumi District about our government's intentions to establish a national-cultural autonomy for all ethnic Abkhazians to enjoy, a small group of people of African descent, also known as Afro-Abkhazians or African Caucasians, from the small settlement Adzyubzha at the mouth of the Kodori River, have gathered to express their opinion on a specific autonomy their community needs.\n\nWhile some of our ministers argue that they are indeed Abkhazians, according to their own words and they will get the autonomy, the Afro-Abkhazians want their settlement to get specific attention and guarantees that they won't be forgotten or their rights violated. Even though some don't see anything wrong about that, there are still some ministers that object this, as we should treat all Abkhazians despite their descent or origin."
abk.98.a: "What?! They have only a small village and they are technically Abkhaz!"
abk.98.b: "Let them have autonomy as well, if they wish..."

abk.99.t: "Abash Shabaan Coups the Government!"
abk.99.d: "A notable leader of Afro-Abkhazians, Abash Shabaan, a rided of the Abkhazian hundreds of the Circassian cavalry regiment of the Caucasian native division during the Weltkrieg, has been living in his native settlement of Adzyubzha since the end of hostilities. During this time he became a well-known supporter of the Kiaraz and Nestor Lakoba, as he managed to provide a serious military training for the volunteer peasant brigades.\n\nWith our government's refusal to grant his village autonomy, he had rallied the Kiaraz supporters and some of the Afro-Abkhazians in order to seize power in the District and restoring the power to the Abkhaz people. In a sudden attack he managed to get our government arrested and dissolved by his own will. With the country in shock after another coup in recent year, Abash Shabaan has met with Lakoba in order to restore people's power to the Kiaraz. However, there's still a chance that even Lakoba will forget the Afro-Abkhazians and perhaps, he should not be given full authority, since Shabaan is commanding now."
abk.99.a: "Lakoba and Kiaraz has triumphed! Shabaan is the Black Hero of Abkhazia!"
abk.99.b: "We should not trust even Lakoba! Consolidate power in Shabaan's hands!"

abk.100.t: "[FROM.GetName] Offers Unification"
abk.100.d: "The Embassy of the distand country of [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has approached us with an offer to unite our countries into a stronger one. With the descendants of our kin, the Afro-Abkhazians, now in power in the country, they are eager to bring peace and liberation to their relatives in Africa. How shall we react?"
abk.100.a: "What an idiotic offer!"
abk.100.b: "We agree!"

abk.101.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
abk.101.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer!"

abk.102.a: "Splendid!"

abk.103.t: "An Offer From [FROM.GetName]"
abk.103.d: "The new government in [ABK.GetName] has offered us assistance in our Egyptian campaign. They desperately need to liberate their relatives and brothers in Africa, and, therefore, they demand to get Sudanese lands when we conquer them. In return, they will provide us with any necessary assistance to the newly conquered lands in Africa."
abk.103.a: "Of course, we will help them!"
abk.103.b: "What?.."

abk.104.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"
abk.104.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our offer!"

abk.105.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] govenment has refused our offer!"
abk.105.a: "Turks cannot be trusted."

abk.106.t: "Restoring Abasgia?"
abk.106.d: "In ancient times on the territory of Abkhazia was the state of Abazgia, which was part of the great Rome. At the end of the 8th century, having freed itself from the power of Byzantium, power in Abazgia passed to the Achba dynasty, which took the title of King of Abkhazia. Now, according to recent data, Abkhazians are indisputable descendants of the Abazgians and our country is often referred to as Abazgia.\n\nBut not only Abkhazians are descendants of the great Abazgians. Also our brothers to the north, the Circassians and Adygs belong to the same linguistic and ethnic group with us. In this regard, a number of military leaders have demanded that the King accept the title of King of Abazgia and lay claim to the territories of great Abazgia, now not under our control."
abk.106.a: "Abkhaz and Adygs are one people - proclaim Abasgia!"
abk.106.b: "We are brothers, but not one people. Stay with Abkhazia!"

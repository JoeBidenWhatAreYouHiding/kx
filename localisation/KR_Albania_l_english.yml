### Leaders ###
POLITICS_WILLIAM_WIED_DESC:0 "A German army officer and midling noble, just before the start of the Weltkrieg, Wilhelm was crowned Prince of the newly independent Albania. However, the Weltkrieg would quickly see Wilhelm all but deposed as Albania became a battleground. Eventually restored to the throne, Wilhelm was then quickly overthrown and an Albanian republic declared.\nOnce again restored to the Albanian throne, Wilhelm now juggles competing interests and personal loyalties at home and abroad. Perhaps in time with the assistance of his foreign benefactors, the Albanian people will come to fully accept this German protestant as their Prince."
POLITICS_ENVER_HOXHA_DESC:0 "A Bektashi from Gjirokastër, Hoxha studied in Paris and became affiliated with various revolutionary movements and factions that came to prominence in the aftermath of the Civil War. Young Enver was among the circles of groups from anarcho-syndicalists to the emerging charterite faction. While staying in the Commune, he became acquainted with members of the Albanian emigree National Revolutionary Committee and its leader, Ali Kelmendi. Hoxha quickly rose up through the ranks and became the suspected successor of Kelmendi himself. Leading a revolutionary vanguardist faction inside KONARE, Enver worked tirelessly with other partisans to liberate his homeland from the yoke of aristocratic oppression. With the socialist victory and new order being built across all of Albania, no one is certain where the winds of destiny might take this youthful firebrand."
POLITICS_SHEFQET_VERLACI_DESC:0 "One of Albania's wealthiest men, Shefqet Vërlaci was a major financial backer of the nationalist conspiracy which overthrew Prince Wilhelm. He likewise greatly affected the political system of the young Albanian Republic, particularly in the bicameral structure of the legislature. He now focuses his considerable wealth and political acumen to the preservation of the aristocratic power in Albania, particularly in opposition to increasingly popular radical land reform proposals."
POLITICS_FAN_NOLI_DESC:0 "The American educated Fan Noli first came to prominence within nationalist circles at the head of a nationalist-aligned breakaway faction from the Albanian Orthodox Church in the United States. He eventually came to also found the 'Vatra' diaspora organization, which grew quickly and providing critical financing to the nationalist cause.\nThe recent death of the young Avni Rustemi left a great void in the Albanian left and Fan Noli has attempted to fill it. He has attempted to to de-militarize the left-nationalist movement, renaming the Unity Party and forging ties with the nation's new middle class."

### Events ###
albania.1.t:0 "The Republic of Albania"
albania.1.d:0 "The outbreak of the Weltkrieg brought new problems for Albania as Austria-Hungary demanded Albanian soldiers to fight alongside them in the war. When Prince Wilhelm of Wied refused, citing the neutrality of Albania as set forth by the Treaty of London, the Austro-Hungarians quickly cut off the remuneration that he had been receiving. His regime collapsed and he left the country on September 3, 1914 to join the Imperial German Army despite formally remaining the Albanian head of state. In 1921, the Peace with Honour officially determined the status of Albania; it would be a restored principality under the authority of Prince Wilhelm, influenced by Austria.\n\nHowever, due to developments in Austria, Albania was able to break free in 1924 with the help of many Albanian nationalists such as Ahmet Zogu, Shefqet Vërlaci, Ali Kelmendi, Sulejman Delvina, Fan Noli, and Anvi Rustemi. They successfully chased out the prince and removed all Austrian influence from the nation. The Albanian Revolution of 1924, as it is known, saw the emergence of two political parties in Albania: the Unity Party under Avni Rustemi and the Progressive Party under Shefqet Vërlaci.\n\nWith the help of Vërlaci, the largest landowner in Albania, and other aristocratic elements in the nation, Ahmet Zogu and the rest of the Progressive Party were able to secure victories in the 1924, 1928, and 1932 elections. However, democratic elements within the nation and in the Unity Party have been agitating for land reform and the redistribution of power to the lower class. All of these reforms have been denied by the Progressives and, as it stands, Albania is a very polarised nation with tough times ahead..."
albania.1.a:0 "Ne do të mbizotërojmë, pa marrë parasysh rrethanat..."
albania.1.b:0 "Why can't I see the foreign policy tree?"

albania.1000.t:0 "Decisions"
albania.1000.d:0 "You may be wondering where the [Root.GetAdjective] focus tree is. Well, despite having shown [Root.GetName]'s foreign policy tree during the progress report, the tree itself has been entirely converted to decisions.\n\nThe prerequisites for unlocking the tree are as follows:\n\n1. Albania must not have the Black Monday idea.\n\n2. The date must be after the 1st of April, 1936, so as to prevent the player from pursuing any foreign policy decisions prior to Black Monday.\n\nHopefully, this has cleared up any sort of confusion."
albania.1000.a:0 "Thank you!"

albania.2.t:0 "Black Monday Has Hit Albania!"
albania.2.d:0 "On the 3rd of February, 1936, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged, bringing the rest of the world down with it. Albania is a very new and agrarian nation and has struggled to find its standing in the world due to a lack of agrarian reform, industrialisation, and the concentration of power in the hands of aristocrats. Democratic elements within our nation, especially those in the Unity Party, have already been clamouring for the liberalisation and industrialisation of the nation. With unemployment rates skyrocketing and the economy in free-fall, the people have begun to turn against us and heed the words of Rustemi and Noli. In addition, the aristocrats who have continually funded the Albanian National Bank are now unable to do so due to the failure and shutting down of the bank. On top of all of this, the Albanian Elections of 1936 are coming up and economic developments seem to have tipped the balance of power in favour of the Unity Party."
albania.2.a:0 "Dammit!"

albania.3.t:0 "The [GetYear] Albanian Elections"
albania.3.d:0 "The most anticipated elections in a long time, the [GetYear] Albanian Elections have every Albanian on the edge of his or her seat. In addition, the increased polarisation within the nation has had both the Progressive Party and the Unity Party, and their supporters, at each other's throats. The Progressive Party have campaigned upon a platform of minor industrialisation, banking reform, balancing of the budget, deflation measures to counteract the effects of Black Monday, and better conditions for sharecroppers. The Unity Party, meanwhile, have advocated for land reform, agrarian reform, the industrialisation of Albania, the liberalisation and westernisation of Albania, and the improvement of the condition of the people. This election shall decide the fate of Albania for years to come. The votes have been officially counted and the winner of the election is..."
albania.3.a:0 "The Unity Party!"
albania.3.b:0 "The Progressive Party!"

albania.4.t:0 "Balancing the Budget"
albania.4.d:0 "By investing more into the creation of a robust social system alongside increasing taxes on the aristocrats, we have slowly, yet surely, managed to balance the budget and allow for the government to operate on some sort of surplus. In addition, the money that we have managed to save up is useful in that it will allow us to carry out some of the extensive programmes that we had originally advocated for."
albania.4.a:0 "Onward!"

albania.5.t:0 "Balancing the Budget"
albania.5.d:0 "Through convincing our fellow aristocrats and landowners to help support the current government, in return for favours of course, alongside subsidising various crops in Albania, we have managed to slowly, but surely, balance the budget and gain a monetary surplus. With the new money in the state's coffer, we can now begin to carry out the programmes that we had initially intended to."
albania.5.a:0 "Onward!"

albania.6.t:0 "Banking Reform"
albania.6.d:0 "Funding the Albanian National Bank was no easy task. Through the use of foreign loans and help from our wealthier supporters, we have managed to invest in the Albanian National Bank. By doing so, we can continue to better manage currency, promote economic growth, and retain the stability of prices."
albania.6.a:0 "Excellent."

albania.7.t:0 "Banking Reform"
albania.7.d:0 "We have convinced the aristocrats, landowners, and the rest of the nobility within the nation to continue funding the Albanian National Bank as it is in their best interest to do so. By doing so, we can continue to better manage currency, promote economic growth, and retain the stability of prices."
albania.7.a:0 "Excellent."

albania.8.t:0 "Aristocratic Resistance to Industrialisation!"
albania.8.d:0 "The aristocrats have come out in opposition to the industrialisation programme undertaken by the party, citing a potential decrease in profits if the programme were to successfully pass. It is clear that the landowners do not want any competition, or for Albania to transition from an agrarian nation to an industrial one, lest they lose profits generated from various sharecroppers."
albania.8.a:0 "Who cares what they think?"

albania.9.t:0 "Progressive Resistance to Land Redistribution Efforts!"
albania.9.d:0 "Ahmet Zogu, and the rest of the Progressives, alongside the aristocratic landowners, have been violently resisting land redistribution efforts, citing the current government policy of agrarian reform as 'unfair' and 'disenfranchising towards a portion of the population'. In addition, after instituting the policy, Rustemi, the leader of the Unity Party, has already faced more than a few assassination attempts. If we do not bring about and end to the situation quick, we may face collapse!"
albania.9.a:0 "Damn them!"

albania.10.t:0 "Rumours of Assassination Attempts on Rustemi"
albania.10.d:0 "The Progressives, now extremely unhappy with the land redistribution efforts and coming to the conclusion that the Unity Party has no intention to stop their extensive reforms, they have begun to take matters into their own hands. Rumours of an assassination attempt on Rustemi and other ways to undermine the Unity Party have been surfacing..."
albania.10.a:0 "God help us."

albania.11.t:0 "Attempted Assassination of Avni Rustemi!"
albania.11.d:0 "The Progressives have made their move and have hired an assassin to take out Rustemi and end his and the rest of the Unity Party's reforms. While walking down the steps of the Albanian Parliament, a man steps out from a car, producing a pistol before loosing shot after shot at Rustemi..."
albania.11.a:0 "...Rustemi is shot twice, and dies before aid can arrive."
albania.11.b:0 "...Rustemi is hit, but an aide takes him to safety in time."

albania.12.t:0 "Foiled Assassination Attempt"
albania.12.d:0 "Due to our investment in the Arm of Gendarmerie, we have managed to foil an assassination attempt on Avni Rustemi by the Progressive Party. The assassin was caught by the gendarmerie and all who were directly involved with the plot have been implicated."
albania.12.a:0 "Thankfully, the situation was handled well."

albania.13.t:0 "Alliance Offer From Albania?"
albania.13.d:0 "News has come from the an Albanian delegation; apparently, they seek to form an alliance with us. While we had assisted them against the Serbian menace during the Weltkrieg, working side by side with Albanian guerrillas, they still continue to claim a portion of Macedonia as theirs due to the number of Albanians living in the area. Though the fact remains that we are not seen in a positive light by most nations in the Balkans and any aid in our favour could prove to be a smart choice down the line. What say we?"
albania.13.a:0 "Accept the offer; we could use the help."
albania.13.b:0 "Reject the offer; we've no time for them."

albania.14.t:0 "Bulgaria Has Accepted Our Offer!"
albania.14.d:0 "We've just received great news from the Bulgarians: they've accepted our offer of an Albanian-Bulgarian alliance. This will certainly help further our foreign policy goals and ensure that we can protect ourselves from neighbouring countries which eagerly await our downfall."
albania.14.a:0 "Great!"

albania.15.t:0 "Bulgaria Has Rejected Our Offer!"
albania.15.d:0 "Bad news has just come from the Bulgarians: apparently, they've rejected our offer of an alliance, citing our claims on Macedonia and our precarious position in the Balkans as grounds for rejection."
albania.15.a:0 "How dare they!"

albania.16.t:0 "Reformation of the Justice System"
albania.16.d:0 "While it will certainly be no easy task, we have already begun the reformation of the justice system and have codified our law based on the Swiss Civil Code in order to westernise and modernise our courts. We can now look forward to a brighter, freer, and just Albania."
albania.16.a:0 "Justice for all!"

albania.17.t:0 "Freedom of Press"
albania.17.d:0 "By loosing restrictions on the press and abolishing censorship laws, we can begin slowly liberalising the press laws and ensuring the creation and development of a free media. This will, however, open us up to more criticism by our detractors."
albania.17.a:0 "So be it."

albania.18.t:0 "Trade Agreements with Neighbouring Countries?"
albania.18.d:0 "It's clear that Albania must begin opening up its borders to trade with other nations in order to combat the effects of Black Monday. This will help benefit both us and the nation we're trading with alongside improving relations with our neighbouring countries. The question remains: who shall we trade with?"
albania.18.a:0 "Bulgaria!"
albania.18.b:0 "Romania!"
albania.18.c:0 "The Two Sicilies!"

albania.19.t:0 "Trade With Albania?"
albania.19.d:0 "Albania has just reached out to us in an attempt to foster relations and help open up trade relations between our two nations. This could certainly help us better fight off the effects of Black Monday while boosting relations between our two nations. With that in mind, we have decided to..."
albania.19.a:0 "Trade with the Albanians."
albania.19.b:0 "Not trade with the Albanians."

albania.20.t:0 "Albanian-Bulgarian Economic Ties!"
albania.20.d:0 "Word has come that the Bulgarians have decided to accept our offer of trade between Albania and Bulgaria, effectively ensuring better relations between our two nations while also helping us better combat the effects of Black Monday. This will surely be a great economic boon for years to come!"
albania.20.a:0 "A toast to our Bulgarian friends!"

albania.21.t:0 "Bulgarian Refusal"
albania.21.d:0 "Bulgaria has refused our offer of economic ties between our two nations, citing the current economic instability of Black Monday and are, therefore, unwilling to take risks they would have normally considered economically sound."
albania.21.a:0 "Dammit..."

albania.22.t:0 "Trade With Albania?"
albania.22.d:0 "Albania has just reached out to us in an attempt to foster relations and help open up trade relations between our two nations. This could certainly help us better fight off the effects of Black Monday while boosting relations between our two nations. With that in mind, we have decided to..."
albania.22.a:0 "Trade with the Albanians."
albania.22.b:0 "Not trade with the Albanians."

albania.23.t:0 "Albanian-Romanian Economic Ties!"
albania.23.d:0 "Word has come that the Romanians have decided to accept our offer of trade between Albania and Romania, effectively ensuring better relations between our two nations while also helping spur the development of better economic ties. This will surely be a great economic boon for years to come!"
albania.23.a:0 "A toast to our Romanian friends!"

albania.24.t:0 "Romanian Refusal"
albania.24.d:0 "Romania has refused our offer of economic ties between our two nations, citing the current concentration of resources to build up their nation internally and recover from the effects of the civil war."
albania.24.a:0 "Dammit..."

albania.25.t:0 "Riots Within Albania!"
albania.25.d:0 "Avni Rustemi, Fan Noli, and the rest of the Unity Party, alongside the lower class, have been violently rioting against our resistance towards land redistribution efforts, citing the current government policy of stalling agrarian reform as "unfair" and "disenfranchising towards a portion of the population". In addition, after bringing an end to the policy, Vërlaci, the leader of the Progressive Party, has already faced more than a few assassination attempts. If we do not bring about and end to the situation quick, we may face collapse!"
albania.25.a:0 "Damn them!"

albania.26.t:0 "Rumours of Assassination Attempts on Vërlaci"
albania.26.d:0 "The Unity Party, now extremely unhappy with the stalling of land redistribution efforts and coming to the conclusion that the Progressive Party has no intention to begin agrarian reform, have begun to take matters into their own hands. Rumours of an assassination attempt on Vërlaci and other ways to undermine the Progressive Party have been surfacing..."
albania.26.a:0 "God help us."

albania.27.t:0 "Attempted Assassination of Shefqet Vërlaci!"
albania.27.d:0 "The Unity Party have made their move and have hired an assassin to take out Vërlaci and end his and the rest of the Progressive Party's rule. While being driven to a rally in Tirana, a figure throws a package from a window onto the path of the vehicle, the package explodes...."
albania.27.a:0 "...Hitting the wrong vehicle as Vërlaci's driver swerves onto a different road."
albania.27.b:0 "...Sending Vërlaci's car flying into a building"

albania.28.t:0 "Foiled Assassination Attempt"
albania.28.d:0 "Due to our investment in the Arm of Gendarmerie, we have managed to foil an assassination attempt on Shefqet Vërlaci by the Unity Party. The assassin was caught by the gendarmerie and all who were directly involved with the plot have been implicated."
albania.28.a:0 "Thankfully, the situation was handled well."

albania.29.t:0 "Crushing the Opposition"
albania.29.d:0 "We've tolerated democratic rabble rousers within the nation for far too long. It is time we end the power of opposition and begin transfer and consolidation of power into the hands of those who truly deserve it: the aristocracy. All of the opposition parties in Albania shall be disbanded and the aristocracy shall reign supreme for we are what truly make Albania the great nation that it currently is."
albania.29.a:0 "Long live the aristocracy!"

albania.30.t:0 "The [GetYear] Albanian Elections"
albania.30.d:0 "The [GetYear] Albanian Elections have finally begun, with the people on the edge of their seats, eager to see the victor of the elections. As usual, the two parties that have the greatest chance of winning are the social democratic Unity Party and the social conservative Progressive Party. The votes have been officially counted and the winner has come out to be..."
albania.30.a:0 "The Unity Party!"
albania.30.b:0 "The Progressive Party!"

albania.31.t:0 "Alliance Offer From Albania?"
albania.31.d:0 "News has come from the an Albanian delegation; apparently, they seek to form an alliance with us. While we had been the first nation to recognise their independence during the Weltkrieg, Albania is not a nation strong enough to help assist us in any potential conflicts. Though the fact remains that any aid in our favour could prove to be a smart choice down the line. What say we?"
albania.31.a:0 "Accept the offer; we could use the help."
albania.31.b:0 "Reject the offer; we've no time for them."

albania.32.t:0 "Romania Has Accepted Our Offer!"
albania.32.d:0 "We've just received great news from the Romanians: they've accepted our offer of an Albanian-Romanian alliance. This will certainly help further our foreign policy goals and ensure that we can protect ourselves from neighbouring countries which eagerly await our downfall."
albania.32.a:0 "Great!"

albania.33.t:0 "Romania Has Rejected Our Offer!"
albania.33.d:0 "Bad news has just come from the Romanians: apparently, they've rejected our offer of an alliance, citing our precarious position in the Balkans as grounds for rejection."
albania.33.a:0 "How dare they!"

albania.34.t:0 "An Offer of Friendship From the Albanians"
albania.34.d:0 "In an attempt to cultivate ties and further expand their influence on the world stage, the Albanians have approached us in hopes of deepening Albanian-Egyptian relations. Seeing as the royal family has Albanian origins, the fact that Albania is a Muslim nation, and our common enmity towards the Ottomans, it is only natural that we accept their approach."
albania.34.a:0 "Send word to our new friends!"

albania.35.t:0 "Successful Delegation to Egypt!"
albania.35.d:0 "Word has arrived from the Albanian embassy in Egypt that our efforts of cultivating ties between our two nations has been a monumental success. Citing the Albanian origins of the Egyptian royal family, shared religious heritage, alongside mutual enmity towards the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptians received our offer of friendship rather well."
albania.35.a:0 "A rather joyous occasion!"

albania.36.t:0 "An Offer of Friendship From the Albanians"
albania.36.d:0 "In an attempt to cultivate ties and further expand their influence on the world stage, the Albanians have approached us in hopes of deepening Albanian-Sicilian relations. Seeing as there exist a large group of Albanian expats within the Two Sicilies, it is only natural that we accept their advances."
albania.36.a:0 "Send word to our new friends!"

albania.37.t:0 "Successful Delegation to the Two Sicilies!"
albania.37.d:0 "Word has arrived from the Albanian embassy in the Two Sicilies that our efforts of cultivating ties between our two nations has been a monumental success. Citing the presence of Tosk Albanians within the nation, the Sicilians received our offer of friendship rather well."
albania.37.a:0 "A rather joyous occasion!"

albania.38.t:0 "The Reclamation of Kosovo"
albania.38.d:0 "Kosovo, the home of the Albanian National Awakening, has been in the hands of the treacherous Serbians for far too long. The land itself is rightfully Albanian, with most, if not all, of the inhabitants considering themselves to, rightfully, be ethnically Albanian. For years, we have had to sit idly, allowing the Serbians to hold on to the area. That ends today."
albania.38.a:0 "Long live Albania!"

albania.39.t:0 "Albania Has Attacked Us!"
albania.39.d:0 "In a surprising move, the Albanians have declared war against us in an attempt to secure the rightful Serbian territory of Kosovo which they claim is Albanian. The territory has been with us ever since we had secured a victory against the Ottoman Empire following the conclusion of the Balkan Wars. It is only rightful that we retain the land and we shall do so."
albania.39.a:0 "We shall never surrender!"

albania.40.t:0 "Partisan Attack on Newly Established German Schools!"
albania.40.d:0 "In an attempt to oppose, and destroy, the newly established German schools, Albanian nationalist partisans have taken to vandalising and destroying the property, hoping to scare us off and prevent us from building and funding the construction of German schools."
albania.40.a:0 "They shall not succeed!"

albania.41.t:0 "Vërlaci Has Been Killed!"
albania.41.d:0 "In a surprising event for both the common Albanian and international observers, the assassination attempt on Shefqet Vërlaci has managed to succeed, with the former president of Albania being killed and the Unity Party, led by Avni Rustemi, assuming power. Today is a dark day, for many Albanians, while having an intense dislike of Vërlaci, do not view the Unity Party as the rightful leaders of Albania..."
albania.41.a:0 "It will take time to cement our rule."
albania.41.b:0 "Zogu performs a Counter-Coup!"

albania.42.t:0 "Vërlaci Has Survived!"
albania.42.d:0 "Thankfully, the assassin, who many had already expected to fail, has not managed to kill [Root.GetLeader], who is safe, yet still harmed, and recovering. The people who had hired the assassin, namely, the Unity Party, and the assassin himself have all been purged with Fan Noli now in charge of the declining party."
albania.42.a:0 "Today is a joyous occasion!"

albania.43.t:0 "Rustemi Has Been Killed!"
albania.43.d:0 "In a surprising event for both the common Albanian and international observers, the assassination attempt on Avni Rustemi has managed to succeed, with the former president of Albania being killed and the Progressive Party, led by Shefqet Vërlaci, assuming power. Today is a dark day, for many Albanians, who had held high views of Rustemi, do not view the Unity Party as the rightful leaders of Albania..."
albania.43.a:0 "The Progressives make an expected comeback."
albania.43.b:0 "Austrian forces occupy Tirana and restore the House of Wied."

albania.44.t:0 "Rustemi Has Survived!"
albania.44.d:0 "Thankfully, the assassin, who many had already expected to fail, has not managed to kill [Root.GetLeader], who is safe, yet still harmed, and recovering. The people who had hired the assassin, namely, the Progressive Party, and the assassin himself have all been purged with Ahmet Zogu now in charge of the declining party."
albania.44.a:0 "Today is a joyous occasion!"

albania.45.t:0 "Wied's Privy Council"
albania.45.d:0 "Due to the beginning of the reversal of the current republican institutions, it is important that we begin to find substitutes for the former establishments that had previously existed prior to our reign. Wied's privy council, which had existed during the days of the Principality of Albania, has once more been assembled to help advise the king and help better direct the nation. Loyal and qualified members have been chosen to join the council."
albania.45.a:0 "This will be a great boon."

albania.46.t:0 "Redistribution of Land to Catholics"
albania.46.d:0 "In order to help better win over the loyalty of Albanians, and take power away from those who pose a threat to our rule, we must turn our attention the Catholics living within Albania. As it stands, those who hold power in Albania are the landowners, the majority of which are Muslim. By taking away their land, and redistributing it to the Catholics, we can better win them over. This does, of course, come with the risk of angering the aristocrats, particularly the Progressive Party."
albania.46.a:0 "The redistribution must go forth."

albania.47.t:0 "Cementing Our Power"
albania.47.d:0 "It is clear that we must cement our rule if we are to retain control of the ever turbulent and chaotic nation that is known as Albania. To do so, we shall shut down all organised opposition that may, in the short and long term, pose any sort of threat to us. Of course, this will most certainly not please Albanian nationalists and pro-republicans within the nation."
albania.47.a:0 "So be it."

albania.48.t:0 "Partisan Attacks!"
albania.48.d:0 "Partisans, who have not taken kindly to the current changes that we've made, have begun to attack various important buildings in an attempt to force us to reverse our policies. This does not come as a shock, as we've prepared for this eventuality, but it still sets us back."
albania.48.a:0 "Blasted nationalists."

albania.49.t:0 "More Partisan Attacks!"
albania.49.d:0 "Partisans have continued to mercilessly attack us, this time focusing their efforts on taking out crucial supply lines which better help us equip troops so as to deal with them. This has set us back by quite a bit and will take some time to recover from."
albania.49.a:0 "Blasted nationalists."

albania.50.t:0 "Sabotage Against Austrian Companies"
albania.50.d:0 "Albanian nationalists and anti-Austrians have taken to sabotaging new Austrian companies that have begun to set local branches in Albania, intending on driving away foreign businesses. This does not bode well for us."
albania.50.a:0 "We must stand firm in the face of destruction."

albania.51.t:0 "German Schools Showing Progress"
albania.51.d:0 "Due to pursuing our policy of instating and running German schools, alongside making sure that education within Albania, specifically with regards to the attendance of these schools, is compulsory, we have managed to lower illiteracy rates by a great amount. This will, of course, greatly assist us in our efforts in that it will help bring about a more educated, and loyal, populace."
albania.51.a:0 "Rejoice!"

albania.52.t:0 "Albanian Oil Shipments"
albania.52.d:0 "Due to our control over Albania, with the installation of William of Wied, we have managed to procure oil shipments from Albanian which will most certainly assist us economically in that it will boost our overall industrial production."
albania.52.a:0 "Excellent."

albania.53.t:0 "End of Albanian Oil Shipments"
albania.53.d:0 "As we've now lost control over Albania, with William of Wied no longer on the throne, all oil shipments have been terminated, which means we no longer receive any sort of oil from Albania. No matter how minor, this will be an economic setback."
albania.53.a:0 "Damn..."

albania.54.t:0 "Attempted Assassination of Wied!"
albania.54.d:0 "We should have seen this coming with the recent reforms that have been implemented. While the partisans had only acted against things that had directly affected Albania, such as new schools and the abolition of republican institutions, an assassin has been hired in order to take out Wied and liberate Albania from the Austrian rule. If Wied dies, this could prove to be disastrous for everybody involved!"
albania.54.a:0 "Wied's personal guard apprehend the would-be assassin!"
albania.54.b:0 "The assassin is successful and Wied lies dead!"

albania.55.t:0 "Wied Has Been Killed!"
albania.55.d:0 "News has reached us from Albania that Wied has been killed and all of our efforts to subjugate the nation have failed, with nationalists taking matters into their own hands and seizing power! What shall we do?"
albania.55.a:0 "We shall not stand for this!"
albania.55.b:0 "We are not ready for war..."

albania.56.t:0 "Dealing With the Partisan Threat"
albania.56.d:0 "In order to rid ourselves of the continuous attacks on various buildings, officials, and other institutions, we must turn our attention to dealing with the partisan threat that currently exists. In order to make our jobs easier, we would do well to ask the Gendarmerie to assist us in our endeavours. With all said and done, however, we have no guarantee of their acceptance..."
albania.56.a:0 "We eagerly await their decision."

albania.57.t:0 "Chasing Down the Partisans"
albania.57.d:0 "We have found trace of the partisans near key supply lines and other areas containing crucial infrastructure. While they had managed to escape before we had caught them in the act, this shows signs of good progress, and will, hopefully, lead us to them."
albania.57.a:0 "Here's hoping."

albania.59.t:0 "Catching the Partisans"
albania.59.d:0 "Finally, we've managed to track down the partisans and pinpoint their location to forests hidden within Albania. It seems as though leaders who were once nationalist guerrillas have taken to attacking us. No matter, for they are now in our custody and shall be dealt with shortly."

albania.63.d:0 "In order to increase energy within our nation, it has been suggested by leading experts that we begin to invest government funds in the creation of dams and new power plants.

albania.64.d:0 "With our agricultural sector suffering due to the effects of Black Monday, it is clear that we must take steps to keep our population satisfied. The situation, as it stands, is already on the brink of destabilisation as many within our population, who are not as well off, are facing starvation and, inevitably, death. We must begin to distribute emergency food aid to these poor areas so as to remedy the situation and boost morale and the peoples' confidence in the government."

albania.68.d:0 "For Years, Albanian President Ahmet Zogu has been consolidating his grip over Albania and instituting increasingly authoritarian measures. Sweeping Powers have been granted to the President, including the powers to appoint one-third of the upper house, censor the media and many other extensive powers. In all terms, Zogu is the dictator of Albania. However, Zog and other allies seek to sweep away the entire system, replacing the Legislature and making Zogu King Zog I. "

albania.69.d:0 "The time has come, the Legislature is out of the way and the new Constituent Assembly officially amended the constitution, and officially made Albania a Kingdom. Now, President Ahmet Zogu has been proclaimed as King Zog I, King of the Albanians. Albania has now been transformed into a Monarchy, and even though Zog is officially a Constitutional Monarch, the Nation is still a de-facto Military Dictatorship and Political Opponents to Zog are frequently arrested or killed. "
albania.69.a:0 "Long Live the King!"

albania.70.t:0 "A New Political Situation"
albania.70.d:0 "Albania has been through many changes since Ahmet Zogu was elected President, and one of the main changes is the erosion of democratic elements. Albania is practically a Military Dictatorship, and opposition is punished; however, Zog continues to swear an oath to defend the constitution and exercise his power as a Constitutional Monarch. This has led to a delicate balance of power within the legislature, between the Semi-Absolute power of King Zog, and the parliament, a power that could easily be tipped one way or another based off of the King’s Will."

albania.71.t:0 "A Small Clerical Error"
albania.71.d:0 "With the lands of Greater Albania now firmly within our hands, King Zog, the heir of Skanderbeg and rightful sovereign of all Albanians, now sits atop a regal throne with pride in his heart, knowing that he has truly brought greatness to his subjects. The Albanian people rejoice, for they live prosperous lives in the golden age King Zog has ushered in. Our nation, our armies, and our people are more prideful than ever before, and yet there still exists a small hole in King Zog’s heart - the void of one last unfulfilled desire. \n\nFar across the Mediterranean and past the stormy Atlantic lies the tropical paradise of Brazil - a chaotic but wondrous land that has been the fixation for our glorious king for quite some time. Despite holding no claim to this Amazonian eden, King Zog and his beloved wife Geralidne have lusted after this verdant patch since before his coronation, and now, with the people satisfied and the nation more secure than ever, our beloved royal family decided to treat themselves. Seeking to surprise his wife on their anniversary, King Zog had purchased a large mansion and estate along the northern coasts near the mouth of the Amazon on a property as secluded as it was beautiful. Paying an immense premium on it, Zog was set to reveal the gift when officials from Brazil had arrived at his palace in Tirana, coming to congratulate him on his new purchase. \n\nIt would seem that through a baffling clerical error only possible in the hellish nightmare that is Brazil’s bureaucracy, King Zog had not purchased an Amazonian estate for his wife, but in fact had purchased the entire nation of Brazil instead, and now the Albanian Crown was the legal owner over all of Brazil. With the King still hoping to give a wondrous gift to his beautiful wife and queen, it was now up to the heir of Skanderbeg to choose the fate of the Brazilian nation."

albania.72.d:0 "With our monarchy secured and the crypto-syndicalist terrorists under control we can turn our attention to the effective governance of our principality. And one of the topics that comes up regularly is the official reign name that our Prince Wilhelm zu Wied should take before the Albanian nation.\n\nMany of our advisors, including our loyal Austrian allies and benefactors, have advised us to simply take the sober and noble regal name of 'Vilhelm I', a proposal that has met with the approval of the Prince himself. However, others, although in the minority, concerned about our unpopularity among the Albanian population, seeing us as foreign occupiers, suggested instead that Wilhelm take the name 'Skanderbeg II' in homage to the Albanian national hero of the same name, known for his tireless resistance against the Ottoman invaders. It is now up to the Prince to make the final choice."

albsoc.1.d:0 "Despite the glory and splendor of the House of Zog and all that our glorious king does for our people, some ungrateful souls still rage against the true heir of Skanderbeg. The Komiteti Nacional Revolucionar - also called KONARE or the Revolutionary National Committee - is the chief source of this traitorous anti-monarchist agitation and is additionally Albania’s largest Socialist entity; a coalition of Syndicalists, Communists, and other Leftists under the guidance of revolutionary leader Ali Kelmendi and his close compatriots like Enver Hoxha, Koçi Xoxe, Sejfulla Malëshova, and Llazar ‘Zai’ Fundo. Together, this group of Leftist radicals plot and scheme beneath our very feet, seeking to one day rise up in order to bring foreign Socialism to Albania while casting our beloved Zog to the side. Suspected of receiving foreign aid for the Third Internationale and from Bolshevik sources in the East, many have suggested that our administration move to officially ban this organization, arresting its members in order to crush them at the source. However, others have suggested that Zog’s government can handle these vermin, and that this attention and funding would be better used elsewhere for the benefit of the wider state, and likely Zog’s own pockets. What shall we decide?"

albsoc.2.d:0 "With our administration’s decision to ignore the ‘insignificant’ Socialist resistance movement during its infancy, the crows have come home to roost, for it would seem that this once-powerless cell of protestors has evolved into a full blown Socialist insurgency. Tirana is in flames and much of the countryside now burns as the fires of revolution spark to life all across Albania, spelling out the final doom of King Zog’s decadent regime. Ali Kelmendi and his group of varied Socialist ideologues and militiamen have marched on the capital, finding themselves at the head of Albania’s first Syndicalist government. With KONARE now controlling the destiny of the nation of Red and Black and with little in the way of resistance left around to stop them, all under the Black Eagle will now feel the full glory of Socialism, whether they want to or not."

A true Albanian hero and father of our revolution and subsequently established Socialist state, Kelmendi was one of the most widely beloved figures within the Party, and with his loss, we are cast adrift. In his stead, the Revolutionary National Committee shall collectively rule the nation as a temporary interim government until an internal vote can be held to determine Kelmendi’s successor and the future path the Party should take, though many within KONARE believe that Kelmendi’s favored protegé and right-hand man Enver Hoxha is the likely candidate who shall rise to the top. \n\nRegardless, Albania mourns its national father, and Kelmendi has been named a true Hero of the People, being recognized both here in Albania and across the wider Internationale as one of the greatest Socialist heroes and revolutionaries of the modern age. We shall move on towards the future, but shall always keep his message and his teachings close to heart as Albania marches towards proletarian perfection."

The most anticipated meeting of Albanian Socialists since our infantile republic was first born and baptized in revolutionary fire, this meeting is of unmatched importance, for among these 188 dedicated heroes of Albania, one alone shall be chosen to lead the Revolution going forward. With figures like Koçi Xoxe, Sejfulla Malëshova, Llazar ‘Zai’ Fundo, Ramadan Çitaku, Liri Gega, Hysni Kapo, Sejfulla Malëshova, Haxhi Lleshi, Myslim Peza, Omer Nishani, Spiro Moisiu, Mustafa Gjinishi, and more all involved in the debate and final vote, any one of these Albanian patriots could have risen to the top if not for the charismatic dominance displayed by Party-favorite and former right-hand man to Kelmendi, one Enver Halil Hoxha. \n\nSupported by his wife and fellow revolutionary Nexhmije Hoxha née Xhuglini, Enver has long been one of the most dominant forces within KONARE, and now with Kelmendi finally out of the way, nothing can stop Hoxha’s rise to the top. Orchestrating his supporters and winning over swing voters, the internal vote on who should lead the Party going forward without a hitch, leaving Comrade, or Shok, Enver Hoxha as the new First Secretary of the Albanian Revolution."

albsoc.5.d:0 "With Enver Hoxha having risen to lead the Albanian Revolution in the wake of Klemendi’s tragic death, the new Hoxha administration must be organized and ministerial positions must be refilled. Though this process has largely progressed without issue, one position has sparked debate. The question of who should rise to fill the position of our head of government has caused many a heated argument, with the members of KONARE largely split into two camps. These camps are split on the idea of allowing Enver to remain as both the head of state and head of government simultaneously, wielding near-absolute power, or if a moderating force, at least in appearance, be implemented through the decision of appointing Nexhmije Hoxha - Enver’s loyal wife - as the head of government instead. This would at least give the appearance of a separated government structure, though how much it would limit Enver’s actual reach is not likely to be much. The final choice lies with Enver himself as his hold over Albania becomes evermore absolute. "

albsoc.6.d:0 "Giving a speech to a crowd of thousands at Skanderbeg Square in the center of Tirana, First Secretary Enver Hoxha talked at length about the necessities of Leftist unity and patriotic devotion to the Revolution. However, in the shadows, an assassin lurked with a bullet marked with Hoxha’s name, waiting for his chance to change the course of Albanian history.  Secretly funded by Minister of the Interior Koçi Xoxe, who feared Hoxha’s militarism would put Albania into conflict with his own Pan-Slavic allies across the Balkans like Josip Broz Tito, and by other surviving Socialists, likely backed by foreign powers, who had escaped Hoxha’s purges and now were seeking to free Albania the ‘madman’s’ farcical imperialist ambitions, the assassin was reasonably well-armed and well-prepared for his dubious task, but the final consequences of his actions would be determined by fate. As the shot rang out and the crowd gasped in shocked terror, the fate of Albania’s revolution and Enver Hoxha’s life hung in the balance as searing lead hurtled towards Enver at the podium."

albsoc.7.d:0 "Citing Enver Hoxha’s increasing signs of authoritarianism and his apparent lack of dedication to the Syndicalist ideal, the Workers’ Congress of KONARE has called an important meeting where the fate of First Secretary Hoxha would be judged and finally sealed. Guided by a tribunal composed of Koçi Xoxe, Sejfulla Malëshova, Llazar ‘Zai’ Fundo, and other prominent leaders of the Party, the congress would soon find Hoxha guilty on all accounts in what many Hoxha loyalists have called a kangaroo court. Despite the supposed validity, or lack thereof, of this trial, the effects are binding and absolute, for that is the will of the Party and for the good of the people. As such, Enver Hoxha is to be stripped of his powers, titles, and positions, and shall be ousted from the chair of First Secretary immediately - a position that shall soon be filled by one of the men on the tribunal that just found Hoxha guilty of all crimes. A new age now dawns for Albania and her infantile Socialist government, and how we go forward from here shall define us for years to come."

Written as large as possible in letters hundreds of feet tall, they transcribed the name ‘ENVER’ in bold white text across the mountainside slope, scarring the landscape with a permanent dedication to the late Father of Albania Enver Hoxha, evoking his name glory and immortal for all in Albania to see for generations.

albsoc.19.d:0 "Called the bunkerët, the Albanian bunkers produced by the Syndicalist government represent both Albania’s infallibility in the face of foreign threats and Chairman Hoxha’s magnanimous character. Created with the idea of providing a shelter for each citizen in Albania in case of attack or natural disasters, the bunker project was first planned by Enver Hoxha and later approved by the Workers’ Congress at his behest. With one ordered for each citizen in the nation, nearly 700,000 have been built or officially planned over the process of bunkerization - or bunkerizimi, each made of concrete and steel in a variety of dome-like designs in order to protect the nation, the people, and the Revolution from harm. Designed by military engineer Josif Zagali, these bunkers were first presented by the Party as both a symbol and a practical means of protecting the people of Albania, but have become increasingly viewed as a concrete expression of mismanagement on the part of Hoxha's cabinet. Furthermore, there have been some scattered but worrying reports that certain bunkers already completed have begun to be used as caches for smuggled and stolen weaponry, being stockpiled by some unknown force or group. \n\nThough they may serve a purpose, and may someday protect Albania from foreign horrors, many cannot shake the feeling that this bloated and expensive array of bunkers are the epitome of the Party’s inability to stop disastrous projects already set in motion, while others fear their current reality of being used to hide weapons from the State - or perhaps these doubts are merely the thoughts of a traitorous reactionary."

Capitalizing on the strategic position and history of the city in our goals of utilizing the Adriatic to its full potential, we will capitalize on this maritime legacy and use Durazzo as the lynchpin of our new thalassocracy-in-progress. Funded by our regime and with aid from the local sailors’ and dockworkers’ unions we have good relations with, Durrës shall become a bustling port city once more as we pour everything we have into making it the shining city of prosperity and fortune on the beautiful Adriatic coast, although Hoxha has already begun using some of the port’s functions to slowly amass a modernized fleet of warships and military barges while schmoozing some sailors’ unions to his side, this shall not get in the way of the bounty of wealth we will extract from these pristine waters through Durrës and its ever-growing Durrës."

albsoc.21.d:0 "Our campaign to mold all major religions of Albania into one faith and Church under our Socialist ideology has progressed as smoothly as possible with such a radical change, but an interesting side-effect not expected has been the resurgence of Bogomilism. In small, isolated cells and sects across the Albanian hinterlands, these Neo-Bogomilists preach their neo-Gnostic dualism as they push for a ‘return’ to the original spiritual teachings of Christ while rejecting the ecclesiastical hierarchy of wider Christianity. Named after priest Bogomil of the 10th Century in a name literally translating to ‘dear to God’, the Bogomils were persecuted under the First Bulgarian Empire before spreading across the Balkans and beyond to places like Kievan Rus, Italy, and France. \n\nAnti-elitist to its core, Bogomilism and its new adherents could be of some use to the state, aiding us in our goal of freeing Albania from foreign religions, churches, and spiritual leaders. However, their theism is still antithetical to the core ideas of our Revolution, so perhaps they would best be dismantled despite their regional uniqueness and historical significance, lest they gain too much influence over the anti-theological goals of Hoxhaism."

The center of the Socialist world and the most successful modern example of revolutionary action, France is everything Albania should and shall be in Hoxha’s eyes; a dream that shall come to pass with a little help from his friends. \n\nUsing contacts and calling in favors with allies - such as Auguste Keufer, Émile Pouget, Léon Jouhaux, Georges Sorel, Ludovic-Oscar Frossard, Pierre Semard, Maurice Thorez, and more in groups like the CGT, the Jacobins, and the Sorelians to name a few - made during his time in Paris with the late Kelmendi, Hoxha shall use French expertise to further the goals of KONARE and our revolution. With these contacts and sources of influence so ingrained into the fabric of Hoxha’s being, and by allowing them free access to Albania and her vast mineral riches, he has risen to be the truest and most favored son of the Commune and its leading thinkers, for Enver Hoxha is the greatest Socialist thinker since Lenin and Marx before him, or so he claims, while being the Third Internationale’s easiest ally undoubtedly."

Like the Paleo-Balkans and our other Illyrian ancestors, we shall master these waters, creating our own thalassocracy and bustling trade network on the backs of recruited talent from Fiume and Zadar. Thanks to fleeing rogues, yellow-bellied Socialist turn tail, former ducal guards, and true pirates and other barnacles of the Adriatic, we have been able to find talent worth paying for to gives us the initial edge and knowhow on how to quickly become this region’s new masters of piracy and seaborne warfare. Composed of ships known as the new lembi, or traditional one-mast warships used by the ancient Illyrians, a new fleet has been constructed to accompany these naval ambitions, with the port of Durazzo serving as the production center for this new breed of modern warship.

albsoc.24.d:0 "LSHASH, or the Lidhja e Shkrimtarëve dhe Artistëve të Shqipërisë/League of Writers and Artists of Albania, is a creative and cultural union being formed as a personal pet project by First Secretary Sejfulla Malëshova. Rising as a merger between Tirana’s largest two unions for writers and artists respectively, LSHASH aims at uniting critics, creators, writers, composers, artists, financiers, and appreciators of the craft - any artistic craft that tantalizes the Five Senses - under one revolutionary organization. The goal of LSHASH, aside from fostering the creation of quality art for the masses and the Revolution while supporting local talent, is to aid KONARE in realizing Malëshova’s goal of ushering in a new cultural renaissance of creation forged by our new atmosphere of revolutionary radicalism while also allowing the nation’s greatest creative minds to be always actively observed for signs of disloyalty and agitation. As the first chairman and union director of LSHASH’s activities, Malëshova and his co-members like honorary president Fan Noli and other figures of Albanian nomenklatura such as Lasgush Poradeci, Sterjo Spasse, Nonda Bulka, Et’hem Haxhiademi, Skënder Luarasi, Dhimitër Shuteriqi, Mitrush Kuteli, Ernest Koliqi, Ali Asllani, and Vinçenc Prennushi, shall dictate the cultural palette of Albania as our First Secretary seeks to transform the nation through the varied arts."

albsoc.25.t:0 "Bye Bye Zai"
albsoc.25.d:0 "Despite his more moderate stances in Socialist politics as compared to figures like Xoxe and the late Hoxha, First Secretary Sejfulla Malëshova is a dedicated radical that despises the mild mannered and apathetic status quo most of humanity languishes under. Finding revisionism and reformist compromise to be sickening and spineless in the face of true revolutionary Socialism, Malëshova has long feuded with known figures of such sickening and foolish persuasions as revisionism, and none have received the brunt of this vitriol more than Malëshova’s most hated political rival, Llazar ‘Zai’ Fundo. Attempting to have Fundo whacked in the past over Zai’s Liberal and pseudo-reactionary comments during party meetings and sessions of the Workers’ Congress. Now largely free to do as he pleases amidst the shadows thanks to his unmatched position as First Secretary, Malëshova would soon finally have his revenge on this alleged traitor of the revolution. \n\nFollowing Zai Fundo down to his car one late night after work at the Presidenca after being held up alone and on purpose by Malëshova himself to isolate his unaware prey, the pack of hired goons released by the First Secretary stalked the unaware dunce before ambushing him as he fumbled for his car keys near his party-lended automobile. In a quiet flash, Zai was gagged before being mercilessly hacked to death by hatchet and axes on that lonely Tirana street. Leaving the revisionist dog to bleed out and rot in the street as a message to all in Albania, the group of random thugs hired to perform the hit would be arrested, tried, and executed later as a facade of true justice to appease the ignorant masses, but all in the know will surely get the message - adhere to Malëshova’s party line or die like the revisionist, counter-revolutionary, pseudo-Socialist dogs you are."

albsoc.26.t:0 "The Arbëreshë Plight"
albsoc.26.d:0 "During his time studying abroad in Italy years before his rise, First Secretary Malëshova became invested in the plight of the Arbëreshë - or Italo-Albanian - people. Ethnic kin to those Albanians in the Balkans, the Arbëreshë have been living in Italy for centuries, languishing under the chauvinistic rule of the Italians and their many past masters. With Albania now in a position of strength thanks to the efforts of KONARE and Malëshova’s revolution, perhaps we could finally do something about our Arbëreshë cousins. Should we set sail across the Adriatic and into South Italy in order to liberate our Italo-Albanian kin, or should we forget these ludicrous delusions of nationalist stupidity and supranational Albanian dominance, and instead simply invite the remaining Arbëreshë to come here with a state-funded resettlement program?"
albsoc.26.a:0 "Italo-Albania must be secured!"
albsoc.26.b:0 "We feel for our stranded brethren, but Italy can go sink into the sea."

albsoc.27.t:0 "The Second Noli Government?"
albsoc.27.d:0 "A former Bashkimi himself, it was no shock to most when First Secretary Zai Fundo allowed for the rehabilitation of Albania’s first professional progressives and Leftist politicians, with prominent figures like Bajram Curri and Luigi Gurakuqi joining the widely beloved bishop and veteran politician Fan Noli in Fundo’s first round of re-education procedures with the aid of Bashkimi-friendly Socialists like Riza Cerova and Kostandin Boshnjaku. With the former Prime Minister of Albania from before the rise of Zog now in government once more, many have suggested that Zai Fundo step down as First Secretary in order to let the widely popular Fan Noli to serve in the position instead. Though this would erode some of the power Fundo has amassed and push the revolution in a less radical direction, it would also likely make governing and passing legislation far easier due to Fan Noli’s skill as a compromiser and reputation as diplomatic face of unity among the Albanian Left. What would be best for the Party?"

albsoc.28.d:0 "Dreaming of the day that a united Balkan Communist Federation could liberate the tired masses of southern Europe, First Secretary Zai Fundo now has the resources and the position necessary to achieve such a goal. However, to work to unify such a diverse and unruly region known for its gunpowder-esque proclivity to explode into violence would be madness, but perhaps it is just the madness the Balkans truly needs to finally free itself of this vicious cycle and liberate our proletariat masses once and for all! Should we try to seize on the moment and work to create a Socialist federative republic here in the Balkans, or should we stay put and focus on Albania and our own people alone?"
albsoc.28.a:0 "We shall spread our revolutionary prosperity and liberty to the wider Balkans!"
albsoc.28.b:0 "Albania needs nought but itself!"

albsoc.29.t:0 "A New Kosovar Legend"
albsoc.29.d:0 "A noted Yugophile and Pan-Illyrian/Pan-South Slavic advocate, First Secretary Koçi Xoxe has long personally struggled over the sore subject of Kosovo. Dreaming of a united nation here in the Balkans while still holding deep sympathies to his native Albania, the issue of who should own Kosovo and when has always been a difficult question for him, until now. Finally realizing the truth, First Secretary Xoxe has begun to spread his belief that so-called ‘ethnic’ conflict and tensions in the Balkans hold no ground when we are all the same people, and as such, the conflict is actually driven by forces of reaction competing with just and fair forces of revolution. As such, the Kosovari people represent some of the truest proletarians in Europe, because for centuries they have long endured this endless assault of nationalism and reactionary thought and yet they have persevered as a unique peoples while fusing Albanian, Serbian, and wider ‘Yugoslavian’ facets to create a society, culture, and identity that best fits their unique circumstance. This new Kosovar legend shall form the foundation of Kosovo’s national rhetoric as we work to unify the Slavic peoples of Southern Europe while bringing the Revolution to all."
albsoc.29.a:0 "The long divided people, at last united!"

albsoc.30.t:0 "The Second Tito"
albsoc.30.d:0 "First Secretary Koçi Xoxe has long held curious connections to foreign figures and agents, working on building his own little network of Internationalist allies united in their aim and dream of a Balkans united under Socialism. Chief among these Leftist allies is infamous Illyrian-Croat Josip Broz Tito, who has long been an idol and source of inspiration for Xoxe as our First Secretary molds his ideology and personal image to mimic that of his Croat mentor. Seeking to elevate this emulation to levels not yet seen, Xoxe has insisted that all close to him refer to him as Koçi Xoxe ‘Tito, copying the paternalistic nickname of endearment and respect given to Josip Broz by his family and party members out of affection. This almost embarrassing move has disturbed many within the Party, but few have the gall to say anything to the iron-fisted First Secretary about it, fearing the loss of their position or worse. Whether or not someone can talk any sense into Chairman Xoxe remains to be seen, but regardless, Albania shall be a Yugophilic emulation of Josip Broz’s Illyrian Socialism shoved into an ill-fitting Albanian skin, for the good of the people one would hope."
albsoc.30.a:0 "The people of Albania deserve their Tito too!"
albsoc.30.b:0 "Xoxe alone works just fine."

albsoc.31.t:0 "The Case of Minister Xoxe"
albsoc.31.d:0 "As our Revolution has progressed, Minister of the Interior and chief of national security Koçi Xoxe has done a diligent and thorough job of purging Albania of reactionaries and other sources of counter-revolutionary action, but his loyalty has increasingly come into question as Xoxe tries to stray from the party line and explicit orders from the Workers’ Congress in order to pursue his own secretive agenda. Now brazen enough to openly attack more moderate members of the Party - especially those that oppose his Yugophilic ideas and foreign ties - in order to see our will, or perhaps his own machinations, be done, a case has been raised against him by the State. Before the Workers’ Congress and myself as the unquestionable First Secretary, Xoxe shall stand trial. If he is found innocent, he shall be allowed to continue his duties, likely instilled with a newfound appreciation for the Party and his own mortality. However, if he is found guilty, he shall be quickly executed and replaced by a known Hoxhaxist loyalist, combat veteran, and rising star of the Sigurimi, the young Mehmet Shehu."

albsoc.31.b:0 "Comrade Xoxe is doing his job well, no case would stand."

albsoc.32.t:0 "The Ultimate Apotheosis"
albsoc.32.d:0 "With the deification process of my beloved Enver now sweeping the State and entrapping the hearts and minds of the masses, Albania has rapidly become a living mausoleum and monument to the Father of the Hoxhaist Revolution. As this cult of personality bordering on revolutionary civil religion transforms the culture and philosophy of Albania, I shall use the full extent of my powers as First Secretary in order to transform Albania’s physical reality along with it. In a vast and overfunded process of urbanization, industrialization, aestheticization, and modernization, our new revolution shall build a new Albania atop the old traditionalist heap, emblazoning a new and futuristic nation forged and molded in Enver’s image. However, one detail has caused much debate between the various yes-men and spineless ministers that run around me like arguing children. \n\nThat contentious idea is to officially rename Tirana to Enver, expanding and rebuilding the capital city into an exemplar of revolutionary Hoxhaist excellence, creating new districts and neighborhoods centered around the great Pirimida - a museum erected in the shape of a large pyramid of concrete, glass, and steel dedicated to the legacy of Communism and Hoxhaism - built in Enver’s honor. Over time, Tirana - or Enver - shall grow to become not just a metropolis, but a ‘gigalopolis’ of radicalism that will serve as the sacred and secure beating heart of our purified commune. The debate itself has arisen between the mainline faction that denies such a bold and pompous move, while those more loyal to the Hoxhaist ideas of my dead husband support this renaming initiative. However, my most fanatically loyal adherents - the so-called Ultra-Hoxhaists - demand that not only Tirana, but all of Albania be renamed and rebuilt in Enver’s honor, forcing the masses to abandon the Albanian identity all together in order to truly embrace Enver! Such a plan is too mad, even for me, or perhaps maybe it is not... Whatever the case, by my design the ultimate apotheosis of Hoxhaist loyalty and Enver’s dream of a proletarian utopia shall unite, supported by my undying devotion to his genius exemplified through this transformation and the commune I have built in his name."
albsoc.32.a:0 "We are all Enver, forever and always."

albsoc.32.c:0 "That is going too far, even for me."

albsoc.33.t:0 "The Future of Malëshova’s Syndicalism"
albsoc.33.d:0 "As First Secretary Sejfulla Malëshova continues his own form of the Albanian Revolution hinged entirely around Syndicalist ideology, a question has arisen among his most trusted fellow Syndicalists in KONARE as to which specific blend of Syndicalist thought should be applied to Albania. Most members of our government follow the orthodox line of ‘Liberalized Syndicalism’ we have created here for the Albanian people, which fuses certain aspects of class cooperation into our ideology as we work with re-educated capitalists and industrial leaders in order to kickstart our syncretic economy of ‘Market Syndicalism.’ However, the more radical and unorthodox members of the party have been playing to Sejfulla Malëshova’s dogmatic side, using theory and past examples of liberalized Socialisms going awry in order to push their idea of centralizing the normally heavily decentralized Syndicalist system around the Party and the hands of the First Secretary and wider Workers’ Congress in order to secure the Revolution from any threats or missteps. Whatever form of Syndicalism we decade, it shall not change the fundamental fact that Albania’s foundations are now forged in the unions and other workers’ organizations working together in unison with the Workers’ Congress to create a true and egalitarian Syndicalist paradise."
albsoc.33.a:0 "Our fusion of Syndicalism and Capitalism works best for Albania."

albsoc.34.d:0 "As First Secretary Llazar ‘Zai’ Fundo progresses his moderated and mildly democratized form of Socialism in the wake of Hoxha’s fall and the death of his wretched, tyrannical ideology, a choice must be made between him and the Workers’ Congress on how we shall shape the Revolution and our brand of Albanian Socialism going forward. Far more moderate than his predecessors Hoxha and even Kelmendi, First Secretary Zai could be swayed in a myriad different ways, with reformists and incorporated Bashkimi urging Fundo to return to his roots in a shift to more traditional and less extremist Progressivism in a radicalized form, while many hardliners push for our own take on the Communist approach as they seek to defang and perfect the ideas of Lenin and Marx. Accused of being an Internationalist or Trotskyist in disguise by many, Albania could perhaps take up the torch of the World Revolution, or we could instead take inspiration from Bukharin in Russia, allegedly holding links, though dubious a claim, to our First Secretary. Whatever the case, an agreement within the Workers’ Congress must be made in order to finalize the final heading of the post-Hoxha era and are reborn Revolution."

albsoc.35.t:0 "Forging a Path under Xoxe’s Fist"
albsoc.35.d:0 "As Albania is steeled and centered within the palms of First Secretary Koçi Xoxe’s iron hands, KONARE under its new martial master now takes up the torch of Marx and Lenin in the Balkans, preaching the true Communist message from Tirana for all the behold. While the nation is further consolidated under Xoxe’s undeniable and ever-extending influence, purged of reactionary influence and revolutionary traitors, and consumed by the might and ambition of the growing People’s Army, how we fully achieve our concept of Communism in Albania must be decided. Working with those close to him in the armed forces, the Sigurimi, and his own cabinet, Xoxe must decide as to whether follow his own path towards Communism under his own authoritarian and militarist might, or if we should instead take a note from the Vanguardist and Council Communist Bolsheviks in how to run things, or perhaps even just rely on the People’s Army and the secret police to get things done in a form of Communist junta if need be. Whatever the case, First Secretary and Commander in Chief Koçi Xoxe shall always be in charge as the new and supreme herald of Albanian Communism and our own militarized dictatorship of the proletariat."

albsoc.36.d:0 "In line with this cultural and ideological revolution of my own design that has begun to be aided by many artists, composers, and other cultural figures of Albania such as Lasgush Poradeci, Sterjo Spasse, Nonda Bulka, Et’hem Haxhiademi, Skënder Luarasi, Dhimitër Shuteriqi, Mitrush Kuteli, Ernest Koliqi, Ali Asllani, and Vinçenc Prennushi, I have become distressed over an internal mental debate on whether or not I should include my beloved Nexhmije in this herculean task. Despite her revolutionary fervor and sharp intellect, she is but a youthful flower that likely should be spared from the harsh rigors of rule and national dominance. However, there is no doubt that her help in progressing this total metamorphosis of the Albanian social, cultural, and artistic soul would be a boon unlike any other, accelerating our dash towards the aesthetic and utopian future while shining bright as a beacon of true egalitarianism across genders. However, some shortsighted fools within my government feel my beloved Nexhmije is too fanatical, too ravenous, and too radical in her Hoxhaist outlook to allow anywhere near power, prowling like a wolf under the guide of a meek lamb, even if it is just a position as cultural minister. Whatever the outcome, it is my decision alone to make."

Many within our government now wonder whether or not these lands deserve to be incorporated into our union, claiming that they overstretch the bounds of what could be considered the Balkans, and as such should be left to their own devices. Of course, there are still many that favor integration, as while the Pannonian Basin may be geographically distinct, it has always been deeply tied to its southern neighbors; in culture, economy and politics. Similar issues have arisen over Slovenia, where, particularly in recent years, Austrian influence has far surpassed that of its Southern Slavic brothers.\n\nA decision must be reached quickly, as the future is uncertain and prolonging the question could lead to growing tensions and discontent among the newly liberated population."

albsoc.39.d:0 "With the international liberation campaign announced by First Secretary Malëshova to save our Arbëreshë brothers and sisters finally accomplished the Albanian communard system had to integrate existing Italian socialist movements and structures to better serve our revolutionary purposes. During this process, one figure dominated the talks between Workers' Congress's members as the greatest threat, or saviour to some, within the new cadre of Red Italians in the expanded Commune of Albania. The famous and influential Antonio Gramsci, notorious for his criticism of orthodox Marxian economic determinism, syndicalism's weakness in political struggle and in coining the concept of cultural hegemony, was that man. The creator of his own strand of socialism, known by many as Machiavellian Socialism. In fact his Arbëreshë background, his family coming to Italy under the surname Gramshi from our lands only just a century ago, proved to be a great boon in his campaign of rallying disgruntled communists of Albania and critics of the failed syndicalism system in Italy. While Secretary Malëshova hoped to just ignore this movement, it has grown too large and too strong to go without notice, even in the farthest corners of our administration. To save his position, and hopefully the governing syndicalist system, First Secretary together with the leadership of the Workers' Congress agreed to schedule an all-party vote to put the matter of who shall be the leader of the renewed Albanian-Arbëreshë revolution to rest once and for all."

To get around this fact while still reigning in the power of the various faiths, churches, and clergies, the Workers’ Congress has pushed for the creation of the Unified Church of Albania under the direction of re-educated leftist bishop Fan Noli. This new government-sponsored church shall fuse the various religions of Albania like Islam and Orthodox Christianity into a syncretic and cohesive revolutionary concept of new god building philosophy.

To this day, many of these tribal structures still exist, protecting the rights and needs of their people while enforcing their traditionalist ways. As such a foundational piece of modern Albania, the Workers’ Congress has decided that these tribes shall not be crushed. Instead, the state shall work to break down and reform the tribes in order to bring our Socialist ways to them in a way they find hopefully find palatable as we attempt to end the blood feuds and archaic local laws that hold back much of rural Albania from benefiting from our new Syndicalist policies."

Though these dark times have thankfully passed, yielding to this red future of ours, we must still work to uphold these ties with the lands of our close allies. The nations of the Third International gave KONARE, and by extension Hoxha, the support and safe-harbor we needed to survive and later launch a successful revolution, so let us continue to return the favor under the direction of the Commune’s Truest Son - the true and pure torchbearer of Orthodox Syndicalism."

Though they have begun to become a more common sight, especially among the cities and dense farming regions, we can do better. As such, the Workers’ Congress of KONARE has begun a mass unionization push across nearly every field and economic sector in Albania.

The Workers’ Congress of KONARE has decided to organize a Confederation of Albanian Trade Unions as a new arm of the state administration, serving as a united body of every Syndicalist-aligned union in the State. Though it shall serve as a supplement to the current legislative, executive, and judicial bodies, the goal is that one day in a perfected Syndicalist system, this confederation would evolve into a full trade union congress, or councilist democratic governmental body composed of representatives elected from each constituent trade union. We shall proceed towards this pure expression of Orthodox Syndicalism as design by the revolutionary masters in Paris and London, and until then, the Confederation of Albanian Trade Unions shall become an increasingly fundamental part of the state as our ever-growing web of unions and guilds brings egalitarian freedom to the proletarian masses."

By formalizing this youth wing as an official body of not just the Party but the State apparatus as well, a new revolutionary youth league shall form a new pillar of support for the Albanian Revolution and our Syndicalist goals. With naturalist, wilderness, and Syndicalist-orientated scouts training for both boys and girls all across Albania being provided and heavily encouraged by the State and Party, we shall ensure the Red Wave ensnares the heart and minds of the next generation and the further generations to come, solidifying the Revolution for time immemorial."

Not just other Socialists that organize outside KONARE, but even more moderate non-Socialist parties and groups shall be allowed to voice their honest opinions. We can always benefit from their better suggestions and more insightful parcels of input and advice, but the system shall also be beneficial in sniffing out any lingering signs of reactionary taint or misguided traditionalist thought that would otherwise jeopardize the safety of the Albanian proletariat and their revolution, so let a thousand voices beckon!"

While not in use for emergency purposes, many of the bunkers shall instead be used for art and cultural installations, union centers, military checkpoints, police call boxes, voluntary conscription booths, storage warehouses, radio and surveillance hubs, and more in order not waste resources or space in our newly-protected proletarian paradise-in-progress."

These lands shall be expropriated by our government and redistributed among the proletariat - primarily the agrarian peasantry, as we slowly prepare for the eventual process of further reorganizing these lands into large-scale collective farms."
ALB_No_Other_Way:0 "No Other Way it Ends"
ALB_No_Other_Way_desc:0 "Surprising few in the know, secret reports have come to the attention of those in the upper echelons of the Workers’ Congress that incriminate First Secretary Enver Hoxha as an opportunistic crypto-authoritarian and pseudo-Syndicalist that has committed counter-revolutionary acts by undermining the will of the wider Syndicalist government in order to further his own personal ambitions. As such, the party hierarchy of KONARE and the wider Workers’ Congress has moved to force First Secretary Hoxha’s resignation, backed by the military and secret police forces of the State. With nowhere to run and with no allies left, the time of Hoxha will soon be at an end."

We must drag this nation through the pearly gates of modernity, even by force if we must, for traditionalism and archaic socio-economic practices can no longer prevent the State from reaching its true potential.

Once these key industries are firmly integrated within our hands, we shall spread this nationalization process to all corners of Albania for the good of all."

ALB_Rejuvenation_Classes_desc:0 "Based on concepts penned by one of Kelmendi Hoxha’s key sources of inspiration while in exile, Georges Sorel, KONARE advocates the idea that following the rise and success of revolutionary acts, the various groups of society should be separated, especially in a Syndicalist model such as ours where the proletarian workers are autonomous and separate from bourgeois industrialists. Sorel, and now KONARE, refuses the idea of negotiation between the classes during the period of revolutionary struggle, but that now in the glowing wake of revolutionary victory, it was the proletariat's task to awaken the bourgeoisie from intellectual stupor to recover its morality, ‘productive energy’, and ‘feeling of its own dignity’ that Sorel claimed had been lost because of past democratic and traditionalist ideals. Over time, these remaining bourgeoisie will slowly come over to our side of things, but for now, we must divide the remaining classes for the safety of all while our own people and party members work to turn the wider masses to our Socialist ways entirely."

Under my will as First Secretary and Chairman of Albania, unions shall become the undeniable and central foundation of our society and government, all united under my undefiable will.

Each and every adult member of the Hoxhaist proletariat shall be taught how to aim, shoot, and defend this nation in a variety of ways, capable of forming ad-hoc militias on the fly whenever I call, ensuring Albania is never undefended and that the Revolution and position of First Secretary is always secure from both foreign and domestic threats."

Expected to rule along the party line tempered with a stern fist of iron, Xoxe is further notable for his personal interests of Yugophilism and close political relationships with foreign socialists pursuing the same dream of a South Slav union.

Sparing their fortunes and lives in exchange for total loyalty, adherence to new labor laws and other stringent Syndicalist guidelines, and economic aid to the State, KONARE under Malëshova shall make a deal with the defanged devil in order to uplift the Albanian people in ways never before possible.

Though they may not all share our exact vision, that does not mean they can not be reasoned or compromised with. Albania must rise as the beacon of Leftist Unity in the world, shining away the shadows of totalitarian radicalism and poisonous reactionary thought, creating a bastion of like-minded allies from across the West to protect the true Left at its peaceful and moderate center."

Led by figures like Fan Noli and with Fundo being a former member before joining KONARE, the Bashkimi would be ideal allies, and so we shall work to rebuild cordial relations with these true fathers of progressive thought in Albania.

I shall secure this nation from all potential internal threats and sources of rebellion, for the only way forward must be Enver’s way as dictated by me."

ALB_Renewed_Vision_Albania_desc:0 "Although Enver was truly a genius and master thinker, I too have my own revolutionary ideas and visionary plans that shall refine the Hoxhaist ideology and create a more-perfect Revolution. Never straying from the party line, I shall utilize my position as all-powerful First Secretary in order to renew our march towards paradise and refine the Hoxhaist message. Though I shall always mourn my beloved, and though the masses will always adore the late and great Enver, time waits for nothing and noone, so I must act and progress the Revolution in a more refined manner before Albania falls behind once again."
ALB_Created_Paradise:0 "He Would Have Created a Paradise..."
ALB_Created_Paradise_desc:0 "He would have created a paradise, of that much I am certain, for my Enver’s tenacity, determination, and will to bring about a truly successful Revolution were undoubtable. Although he is not around to see such a utopia come to fruition, I shall ensure that his dream does not die, for Albania shall be forged into the arcadian eden he always envisioned by my hand. The Hoxhaist paradise for the proletariat of Albania and the wider global revolutionary struggle shall be built here along our shores and mountainous splendor, and nothing shall get in our way."
ALB_Worthy_Enver:0 "Be Worthy of Enver"
ALB_Worthy_Enver_desc:0 "In order to build his planned paradise, all in Albania must be worthy of Enver. Working our hardest everyday and always doing our part in the wider revolutionary effort, each and every single citizen must do their part in turn. My government shall oversee that this need becomes a reality, enforcing a new communalist and hardy work ethic as we all labor together to build a society worthy of our patriarch, and each and every Albanian must live to their fullest potential in order to aid in this societal effort while proving their worth to the late Enver himself."
ALB_Deification_Enver_Hoxha:0 "Deification of Enver Hoxha"
ALB_Deification_Enver_Hoxha_desc:0 "Though he was widely respected and beloved in life, that is not enough for my Enver, and as such, the State and Party shall work under my command to foster a widely endorsed and widely accepted cult of personality of the late Enver Hoxha. Deifying my late husband and the father of the Albanian revolution as a modern prophet of Communism like Marx and Lenin, Enver shall rise to new god-like heights atop a new government campaign aimed at getting all in the nation to truly venerate the immortal revolutionary. I shall ensure that each and every citizen understands that Enver equals Albania, with no other truth or reality being accepted. As Enver’s heir and mortal agent, I shall stand at the head of this new cult of personality in order to ensure that all come to understand that my beloved Enver was our own revolutionary and mortal messiah, dying for our sins so that we all may be redeemed in the paradise of my own making under the ways of Hoxhaism. Enver lived, Enver lives, and Enver will live, forever eternal and crimson as a immortal spirit of revolution and of Albania’s undying spirit."
ALB_Progress_Waits_Noone:0 "Progress Waits for No One!"
ALB_Progress_Waits_Noone_desc:0 "For far too long, Albania has been hampered by various stagnating forces, holding us back from our true and unrivaled potential. With the proletariat free, I shall dictate a new series of modernization, urbanization, and industrialization programmes that shall free Albania from the quagmire of our traditionalist past. Passing legislation and policies Enver dreamed of realizing but was prevented due to being on the leash of the moderates, we are now unshackled and truly free to progress Albania towards the crimson future without any breaks or apprehension. The future and all of its bounties shall be ours, for I shall steer us towards modernity and beyond at dazzling speeds in order to not only catch up with the rest of the civilized world, but to surpass it by establishing the State as a new global super power for the good of Albania and the Hoxhaist dream."
ALB_Collectives_Militarization:0 "Militarize the Collectives"
ALB_Collectives_Militarization_desc:0 "In order to defend Albania from all foes both foreign and domestic, I have sent out a mass call to arms to all true proletarian patriots. All autonomous communities, collectives, syndicates, revolutionary guilds, unions, and more are to be militarized, trained to be minutemen and militia in times of need while serving as arms of the state in peacetime, aiding against counter-revolutionary threats hiding at home. The various collectives and similar groups created by Enver shall now serve in the direct protection of his utopia, giving my Hoxhaist government another tool, or more accurately weapon, in the eternal war against reaction."
ALB_Vanguard_Reborn_Leninism:0 "The Vanguard of Reborn Leninism"
ALB_Vanguard_Reborn_Leninism_desc:0 "A youthful nation led by a youthful revolutionary leader, we shall be the new and invigorated vanguard of Lenin’s original revolution, serving as the second coming of his cause purified in this new Hoxhaist frame of my creation. In an unbroken chain of sustained and perfected ideology starting with Marx, refining under Lenin and Enver, and now landing in my own hands to be further molded, I shall lead the reborn vanguard of this new form of Leninist thought free and unshackled by past failures and fully focused on the utopian Hoxhaist future, while ’By the writings of Enver and the action of Nexhmije’ becomes the new identity of our own new breed of Vanguardist perfection."
ALB_Expansion_Sigurimi_Directorate:0 "Expansion of the Sigurimi Directorate"
ALB_Expansion_Sigurimi_Directorate_desc:0 "If the Revolution of my own design built on Enver’s initial teachings is to survive, my loyal Sigurimi will need to expand and adapt to the changing nature of warfare, reaction, and wider reality. Through expanded funding, wider recruitment, refined training methods, and the continued use of indoctrination to achieve peak loyalty, the Sigurimi - or Directorate of State Security - shall become an unstoppable and unavoidable invisible hand of the State under my own control, ensuring that my will is ever-reaching and unavoidable as I continue to build the paradise Enver envisioned."
ALB_Who_Purges_Purgers:0 "Who Purges the Purgers?"
ALB_Who_Purges_Purgers_desc:0 "Although we have begun to be more stringent and strict with their operation, was it not the Sigurimi and their former leader Xoxe that plotted against Enver before his death? In order to keep the secret police in line, they themselves must be policed by my own special internal affairs bureau. Specially made and personally dictated 'Committees of Threes' shall obey my word and signature alone, and shall serve as my most loyal agents as they police the police and purge the purgers, keeping law, order, and my own will absolute and unchallenged while eliminating disloyalty and self-serving traitorous ambition among our ranks, ensuring that my justice - the one and true Hoxhaist justice of Enver - is always obeyed."
ALB_State_Permanent_Purification:0 "A State of Permanent Purification"
ALB_State_Permanent_Purification_desc:0 "In order to achieve the proletarian paradise Enver envisioned and I now endeavor to create, a state of permanent purification must be achieved as the endlessly multiplying chaff of reaction rage against the state, sealing their fate at the hands of my purification measures. No matter the damage we sustain, we shall replace it always with something far more grand, and a prosperous utopia for the proletariat shall be built atop a layer of bodies if it must.The Revolution shall endure over all, and Enver’s ideas and image shall always remain eternal and crimson at our foundation, and to achieve this, I will exercise every power I have in order to see that our paradise is built."
ALB_Liquidate_Revisionist_Factionalism:0 "Liquidate Revisionist Factionalism"
ALB_Liquidate_Revisionist_Factionalism_desc:0 "As stated by Lenin and Enver before me, factionalism shall be the death of the Party and the Revolution. Revisionism and half-measures will not be tolerated in my Albania, for the Hoxahist dream and concept of utopia knows no compromise. The revisionism that sparked to life when Enver drew his last breath shall be put to rest once and for all, and the remaining political groups that still hold power outside of our own shall be defanged and disbanded by threat of force. Plagues like factionalism, revisionism, and moderatism shall be wiped away for good, clearing the way for me to freely guide Albania to the Hoxhaist ideal."
ALB_Dissolve_Party:0 "Dissolve the Party"
ALB_Dissolve_Party_desc:0 "Though it has had its uses, the Party has existed in a state of flux as its members once argued over whether to trust Enver or not. I shall end this debate for them, dissolving the Party in its entirety at once using the Sigurimi and my loyal allies in the armed forces. No longer shall these cowardly ministers and those that failed to protect Enver be allowed to call the shots in my Albania, and so the Committee of Public Safety shall rise entirely under my command, with the aid of only my most trusted allies, ensuring that all power in Albania is centered within my hands. Without obstruction, I will build our utopia, no matter the cost."
ALB_My_Will_Alone:0 "By My Will Alone"
ALB_My_Will_Alone_desc:0 "By my own will alone as First Secretary Nexhmije Hoxha, heir of Enver Hoxha’s Communist ideology and utopian dream, Albania shall be ruled without contest or compromise. The ‘Ultra-Hoxhaist’ revolution founded on the framework built by my late and beloved husband Enver will be my guidebook, and the totalitarian and supremely centralized Marxist-Leninist-Hoxhaist government apparatus shall be my vehicle to create to the utopia we once dreamed of together. Though times of tranquility and romance are long over, times of crimson and gold and of true earthly utopia grow closer with each step forward. Though my beloved is gone, his ideas and hopes for humanity are not, and so by my will alone, the Revolution and this utopian dream shall be achieved, and nothing will stand in my way."
ALB_Legacy_Eternal:0 "His Legacy Eternal"
ALB_Legacy_Eternal_desc:0 "Despite my Enver’s life being tragically cut short, his dream has not died, for I have brought his vision to life! Engraved in our history and reality for time eternal, the legacy of Enver Hoxha has become the unopposed reality of our nation as the Ultra-Hoxhaist platform dominates a proletarian paradise molded in Enver’s image. We shall always remember all Enver did for Albania, and the nation shall always hold him in the highest regard as our founding patriarch and greatest hero. Now, with a fusion of his ideas and my own tweaks now fully functioning as the foundation and framework of this modern and prosperous Albania, let us march into our optimistic and safeguarded crimson future under by rightful rule, guided by His legacy eternal."

ALB_Certain_Sense_Catharsis_desc:0 "Our Revolution built on the purified Hoxhaist spirit has come with its fair share of growing pains, and after a long and violent struggle to achieve our utopia, we can finally all breathe a sigh of relief. Through revolution and necessary conflict, true catharsis and societal peace has been achieved by my hand, and though there are still enemies all around us and despite existing in a universe with a future full of unknowns, Albania and her people can finally relax thanks to my efforts. As the undeniable First Secretary, herald of Hoxhaism, and heir of my beloved Enver, I have created a new golden age where our people can finally enjoy their lives and the paradise I have long struggled and sacrificed to build for them."

And there went forth another horse - fire-colored, and to him who is sitting on it, there was given to him to take peace from the earth, and that mankind may slay one another, and there was given to him a great sword.’ Words hallowed in the name of old and dead gods that still hold some weight to this day, for by my will, Albania shall be the new Red Horse of this world. Across the world we shall ride, and in our wake we shall sow the seeds of Revolution and the genius of Marxist-Leninist-Hoxhaism as refined by me. The Internationalist cause and the wider Global Revolution shall be as eternal as the ideals of our beloved Enver, and by our strength, we shall bring true Communism to all in this world, shattering the final shackles of humanity as if they were the great biblical seals of old, unleashing true proletarian paradise instead of the fearmongering concept of armageddon."
ALB_Plunge_Dagger_Rotten_Heart:0 "Plunge a Dagger into the Rotten Heart"
ALB_Plunge_Dagger_Rotten_Heart_desc:0 "The pathway to true Communism has been obfuscated and obstructed, even corroded, by the foolish naivety of the Third International and its ‘great’ powers of revolution. Paris, the very place our beloved Enver once studied in order to fully understand his true mission in life as a Communist prophet, has devolved into a hive of sin and reactionary debauchery, poisoning the global well of Socialism as a whole and causing most of the world’s Leftist movements to mutate into some false and rotten form of pseudo-Leftist drivel. I shall strike the killing blow to this twisted and black heart infecting the Socialist world and leading the proletariat astray so that my own purified and righteous form of Marxist-Leninist-Hoxhaism can truly rise to save all humanity from itself."

ALB_land_reform_idea:0 "Land Reform"
ALB_land_reform_idea_desc:0 "By instituting agrarian reform and redistributing the land held by the aristocratic landowners to regular Albanians, we can slowly ween ourselves off of the current farming aristocracy that has developed and empower the peasant farmers within our nation.

ALB_farming_techniques_idea:0 "New Farming Techniques"
ALB_farming_techniques_idea_desc:0 "Peasant farmers in Albania have relied upon using wooden ploughs and subsistence farming for far too long. This has had a negative impact on our economy, in that our agricultural output and exports are not as high as they could have been. By upgrading the methods employed by farmers and the tools used, we can increase both the agricultural output of Albania and improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of Albanians."
ALB_illiteracy:0 "Mass Illiteracy"
ALB_illiteracy_desc:0 "Education in Albania is very poor, with eighty percent of the population illiterate. In addition, education is neither compulsory nor does Albania have any formal university. The only group of people within our nation to possess some sort of education are the aristocrats, meaning that we are severely behind our European counterparts when it comes to research and are viewed as a backwater. Separate Turkish schools for Muslims and Greek schools for Orthodox Christians have not helped this issue one bit."

ALB_polarised_nation_idea:0 "Polarised Nation"
ALB_polarised_nation_idea_desc:0 "With the establishment of an independent Albania, two parties in Albania have managed to take power. The social democratic Unity Party led by Avni Rustemi and the social conservative Progressive Party led by Shefqet Vërlaci. With the two parties having differing goals, yet both having vast influence, it's no wonder that, in recent years, Albania has become such a politically polarised nation..."

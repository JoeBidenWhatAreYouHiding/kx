### Leaders ###
POLITICS_WILLIAM_WIED_DESC:0 "A German army officer and midling noble, just before the start of the Weltkrieg, Wilhelm was crowned Prince of the newly independent Albania. However, the Weltkrieg would quickly see Wilhelm all but deposed as Albania became a battleground. Eventually restored to the throne, Wilhelm was then quickly overthrown and an Albanian republic declared.\nOnce again restored to the Albanian throne, Wilhelm now juggles competing interests and personal loyalties at home and abroad. Perhaps in time with the assistance of his foreign benefactors, the Albanian people will come to fully accept this German protestant as their Prince."
POLITICS_ENVER_HOXHA_DESC:0 "A Bektashi from Gjirokastër, Hoxha studied in the Commune France and became affiliated with the Jacobin faction there. Upon returning to Albania, the young Hoxha joined his idol, Ali Kemendi's, revolutionary movement, but eventually became disillusioned with the movement and the man himself. Calling upon his contacts in the Commune of France, Hoxha then founded a small 'vanguardist' organisation, and thanks to foreign intervention, he and his group now stand astride all of Albania."
POLITICS_SHEFQET_VERLACI_DESC:0 "One of Albania's wealthiest men, Shefqet Vërlaci was a major financial backer of the nationalist conspiracy which overthrew Prince Wilhelm. He likewise greatly affected the political system of the young Albanian Republic, particularly in the bicameral structure of the legislature. He now focuses his considerable wealth and political acumen to the preservation of the aristocratic power in Albania, particularly in opposition to increasingly popular radical land reform proposals."
POLITICS_FAN_NOLI_DESC:0 "The American educated Fan Noli first came to prominence within nationalist circles at the head of a nationalist-aligned breakaway faction from the Albanian Orthodox Church in the United States. He eventually came to also found the 'Vatra' diaspora organization, which grew quickly and providing critical financing to the nationalist cause.\nThe recent death of the young Avni Rustemi left a great void in the Albanian left and Fan Noli has attempted to fill it. He has attempted to to de-militarize the left-nationalist movement, renaming the Unity Party and forging ties with the nation's new middle class."

### Events ###
albania.1.t:0 "The Republic of Albania"
albania.1.d:0 "The outbreak of the Weltkrieg brought new problems for Albania as Austria-Hungary demanded Albanian soldiers to fight alongside them in the war. When Prince Wilhelm of Wied refused, citing the neutrality of Albania as set forth by the Treaty of London, the Austro-Hungarians quickly cut off the remuneration that he had been receiving. His regime collapsed and he left the country on September 3, 1914 to join the Imperial German Army despite formally remaining the Albanian head of state. In 1921, the Peace with Honour officially determined the status of Albania; it would be a restored principality under the authority of Prince Wilhelm, influenced by Austria.\n\nHowever, due to developments in Austria, Albania was able to break free in 1924 with the help of many Albanian nationalists such as Ahmet Zogu, Shefqet Vërlaci, Ali Kelmendi, Sulejman Delvina, Fan Noli, and Anvi Rustemi. They successfully chased out the prince and removed all Austrian influence from the nation. The Albanian Revolution of 1924, as it is known, saw the emergence of two political parties in Albania: the Unity Party under Avni Rustemi and the Progressive Party under Shefqet Vërlaci.\n\nWith the help of Vërlaci, the largest landowner in Albania, and other aristocratic elements in the nation, Ahmet Zogu and the rest of the Progressive Party were able to secure victories in the 1924, 1928, and 1932 elections. However, democratic elements within the nation and in the Unity Party have been agitating for land reform and the redistribution of power to the lower class. All of these reforms have been denied by the Progressives and, as it stands, Albania is a very polarised nation with tough times ahead..."
albania.1.a:0 "Ne do të mbizotërojmë, pa marrë parasysh rrethanat..."
albania.1.b:0 "Why can't I see the foreign policy tree?"

albania.1000.t:0 "Decisions"
albania.1000.d:0 "You may be wondering where the [Root.GetAdjective] focus tree is. Well, despite having shown [Root.GetName]'s foreign policy tree during the progress report, the tree itself has been entirely converted to decisions.\n\nThe prerequisites for unlocking the tree are as follows:\n\n1. Albania must not have the Black Monday idea.\n\n2. The date must be after the 1st of April, 1936, so as to prevent the player from pursuing any foreign policy decisions prior to Black Monday.\n\nHopefully, this has cleared up any sort of confusion."
albania.1000.a:0 "Thank you!"

albania.2.t:0 "Black Monday Has Hit Albania!"
albania.2.d:0 "On the 3rd of February, 1936, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged, bringing the rest of the world down with it. Albania is a very new and agrarian nation and has struggled to find its standing in the world due to a lack of agrarian reform, industrialisation, and the concentration of power in the hands of aristocrats. Democratic elements within our nation, especially those in the Unity Party, have already been clamouring for the liberalisation and industrialisation of the nation. With unemployment rates skyrocketing and the economy in free-fall, the people have begun to turn against us and heed the words of Rustemi and Noli. In addition, the aristocrats who have continually funded the Albanian National Bank are now unable to do so due to the failure and shutting down of the bank. On top of all of this, the Albanian Elections of 1936 are coming up and economic developments seem to have tipped the balance of power in favour of the Unity Party."
albania.2.a:0 "Dammit!"

albania.3.t:0 "The [GetYear] Albanian Elections"
albania.3.d:0 "The most anticipated elections in a long time, the [GetYear] Albanian Elections have every Albanian on the edge of his or her seat. In addition, the increased polarisation within the nation has had both the Progressive Party and the Unity Party, and their supporters, at each other's throats. The Progressive Party have campaigned upon a platform of minor industrialisation, banking reform, balancing of the budget, deflation measures to counteract the effects of Black Monday, and better conditions for sharecroppers. The Unity Party, meanwhile, have advocated for land reform, agrarian reform, the industrialisation of Albania, the liberalisation and westernisation of Albania, and the improvement of the condition of the people. This election shall decide the fate of Albania for years to come. The votes have been officially counted and the winner of the election is..."
albania.3.a:0 "The Unity Party!"
albania.3.b:0 "The Progressive Party!"

albania.4.t:0 "Balancing the Budget"
albania.4.d:0 "By investing more into the creation of a robust social system alongside increasing taxes on the aristocrats, we have slowly, yet surely, managed to balance the budget and allow for the government to operate on some sort of surplus. In addition, the money that we have managed to save up is useful in that it will allow us to carry out some of the extensive programmes that we had originally advocated for."
albania.4.a:0 "Onward!"

albania.5.t:0 "Balancing the Budget"
albania.5.d:0 "Through convincing our fellow aristocrats and landowners to help support the current government, in return for favours of course, alongside subsidising various crops in Albania, we have managed to slowly, but surely, balance the budget and gain a monetary surplus. With the new money in the state's coffer, we can now begin to carry out the programmes that we had initially intended to."
albania.5.a:0 "Onward!"

albania.6.t:0 "Banking Reform"
albania.6.d:0 "Funding the Albanian National Bank was no easy task. Through the use of foreign loans and help from our wealthier supporters, we have managed to invest in the Albanian National Bank. By doing so, we can continue to better manage currency, promote economic growth, and retain the stability of prices."
albania.6.a:0 "Excellent."

albania.7.t:0 "Banking Reform"
albania.7.d:0 "We have convinced the aristocrats, landowners, and the rest of the nobility within the nation to continue funding the Albanian National Bank as it is in their best interest to do so. By doing so, we can continue to better manage currency, promote economic growth, and retain the stability of prices."
albania.7.a:0 "Excellent."

albania.8.t:0 "Aristocratic Resistance to Industrialisation!"
albania.8.d:0 "The aristocrats have come out in opposition to the industrialisation programme undertaken by the party, citing a potential decrease in profits if the programme were to successfully pass. It is clear that the landowners do not want any competition, or for Albania to transition from an agrarian nation to an industrial one, lest they lose profits generated from various sharecroppers."
albania.8.a:0 "Who cares what they think?"

albania.9.t:0 "Progressive Resistance to Land Redistribution Efforts!"
albania.9.d:0 "Ahmet Zogu, and the rest of the Progressives, alongside the aristocratic landowners, have been violently resisting land redistribution efforts, citing the current government policy of agrarian reform as 'unfair' and 'disenfranchising towards a portion of the population'. In addition, after instituting the policy, Rustemi, the leader of the Unity Party, has already faced more than a few assassination attempts. If we do not bring about and end to the situation quick, we may face collapse!"
albania.9.a:0 "Damn them!"

albania.10.t:0 "Rumours of Assassination Attempts on Rustemi"
albania.10.d:0 "The Progressives, now extremely unhappy with the land redistribution efforts and coming to the conclusion that the Unity Party has no intention to stop their extensive reforms, they have begun to take matters into their own hands. Rumours of an assassination attempt on Rustemi and other ways to undermine the Unity Party have been surfacing..."
albania.10.a:0 "God help us."

albania.11.t:0 "Attempted Assassination of Avni Rustemi!"
albania.11.d:0 "The Progressives have made their move and have hired an assassin to take out Rustemi and end his and the rest of the Unity Party's reforms. While walking down the steps of the Albanian Parliament, a man steps out from inside a car produces a pistol, taking shot after shot at Rustemi at Rustemi..."
albania.27.a:0 "...Rustemi is shot twice, and dies before aid can arrive."
albania.27.a:0 "...Rustemi is hit, but an aide takes him to safety in time."

albania.12.t:0 "Foiled Assassination Attempt"
albania.12.d:0 "Due to our investment in the Arm of Gendarmerie, we have managed to foil an assassination attempt on Avni Rustemi by the Progressive Party. The assassin was caught by the gendarmerie and all who were directly involved with the plot have been implicated."
albania.12.a:0 "Thankfully, the situation was handled well."

albania.13.t:0 "Alliance Offer From Albania?"
albania.13.d:0 "News has come from the an Albanian delegation; apparently, they seek to form an alliance with us. While we had assisted them against the Serbian menace during the Weltkrieg, working side by side with Albanian guerrillas, they still continue to claim a portion of Macedonia as theirs due to the number of Albanians living in the area. Though the fact remains that we are not seen in a positive light by most nations in the Balkans and any aid in our favour could prove to be a smart choice down the line. What say we?"
albania.13.a:0 "Accept the offer; we could use the help."
albania.13.b:0 "Reject the offer; we've no time for them."

albania.14.t:0 "Bulgaria Has Accepted Our Offer!"
albania.14.d:0 "We've just received great news from the Bulgarians: they've accepted our offer of an Albanian-Bulgarian alliance. This will certainly help further our foreign policy goals and ensure that we can protect ourselves from neighbouring countries which eagerly await our downfall."
albania.14.a:0 "Great!"

albania.15.t:0 "Bulgaria Has Rejected Our Offer!"
albania.15.d:0 "Bad news has just come from the Bulgarians: apparently, they've rejected our offer of an alliance, citing our claims on Macedonia and our precarious position in the Balkans as grounds for rejection."
albania.15.a:0 "How dare they!"

albania.16.t:0 "Reformation of the Justice System"
albania.16.d:0 "While it will certainly be no easy task, we have already begun the reformation of the justice system and have codified our law based on the Swiss Civil Code in order to westernise and modernise our courts. We can now look forward to a brighter, freer, and just Albania."
albania.16.a:0 "Justice for all!"

albania.17.t:0 "Freedom of Press"
albania.17.d:0 "By loosing restrictions on the press and abolishing censorship laws, we can begin slowly liberalising the press laws and ensuring the creation and development of a free media. This will, however, open us up to more criticism by our detractors."
albania.17.a:0 "So be it."

albania.18.t:0 "Trade Agreements with Neighbouring Countries?"
albania.18.d:0 "It's clear that Albania must begin opening up its borders to trade with other nations in order to combat the effects of Black Monday. This will help benefit both us and the nation we're trading with alongside improving relations with our neighbouring countries. The question remains: who shall we trade with?"
albania.18.a:0 "Bulgaria!"
albania.18.b:0 "Romania!"
albania.18.c:0 "The Two Sicilies!"

albania.19.t:0 "Trade With Albania?"
albania.19.d:0 "Albania has just reached out to us in an attempt to foster relations and help open up trade relations between our two nations. This could certainly help us better fight off the effects of Black Monday while boosting relations between our two nations. With that in mind, we have decided to..."
albania.19.a:0 "Trade with the Albanians."
albania.19.b:0 "Not trade with the Albanians."

albania.20.t:0 "Albanian-Bulgarian Economic Ties!"
albania.20.d:0 "Word has come that the Bulgarians have decided to accept our offer of trade between Albania and Bulgaria, effectively ensuring better relations between our two nations while also helping us better combat the effects of Black Monday. This will surely be a great economic boon for years to come!"
albania.20.a:0 "A toast to our Bulgarian friends!"

albania.21.t:0 "Bulgarian Refusal"
albania.21.d:0 "Bulgaria has refused our offer of economic ties between our two nations, citing the current economic instability of Black Monday and are, therefore, unwilling to take risks they would have normally considered economically sound."
albania.21.a:0 "Dammit..."

albania.22.t:0 "Trade With Albania?"
albania.22.d:0 "Albania has just reached out to us in an attempt to foster relations and help open up trade relations between our two nations. This could certainly help us better fight off the effects of Black Monday while boosting relations between our two nations. With that in mind, we have decided to..."
albania.22.a:0 "Trade with the Albanians."
albania.22.b:0 "Not trade with the Albanians."

albania.23.t:0 "Albanian-Romanian Economic Ties!"
albania.23.d:0 "Word has come that the Romanians have decided to accept our offer of trade between Albania and Romania, effectively ensuring better relations between our two nations while also helping spur the development of better economic ties. This will surely be a great economic boon for years to come!"
albania.23.a:0 "A toast to our Romanian friends!"

albania.24.t:0 "Romanian Refusal"
albania.24.d:0 "Romania has refused our offer of economic ties between our two nations, citing the current concentration of resources to build up their nation internally and recover from the effects of the civil war."
albania.24.a:0 "Dammit..."

albania.25.t:0 "Riots Within Albania!"
albania.25.d:0 "Avni Rustemi, Fan Noli, and the rest of the Unity Party, alongside the lower class, have been violently rioting against our resistance towards land redistribution efforts, citing the current government policy of stalling agrarian reform as "unfair" and "disenfranchising towards a portion of the population". In addition, after bringing an end to the policy, Vërlaci, the leader of the Progressive Party, has already faced more than a few assassination attempts. If we do not bring about and end to the situation quick, we may face collapse!"
albania.25.a:0 "Damn them!"

albania.26.t:0 "Rumours of Assassination Attempts on Vërlaci"
albania.26.d:0 "The Unity Party, now extremely unhappy with the stalling of land redistribution efforts and coming to the conclusion that the Progressive Party has no intention to begin agrarian reform, have begun to take matters into their own hands. Rumours of an assassination attempt on Vërlaci and other ways to undermine the Progressive Party have been surfacing..."
albania.26.a:0 "God help us."

albania.27.t:0 "Attempted Assassination of Shefqet Vërlaci!"
albania.27.d:0 "The Unity Party have made their move and have hired an assassin to take out Vërlaci and end his and the rest of the Progressive Party's rule, while being driven to a rally in Tirana, a man throws a package from a window onto the path of the vehicle, the package explodes...."
albania.27.a:0 "...Hitting the wrong vehicle as Vërlaci's driver swerves onto a different road."
albania.27.a:0 "...Sending Vërlaci's car flying into a building"

albania.28.t:0 "Foiled Assassination Attempt"
albania.28.d:0 "Due to our investment in the Arm of Gendarmerie, we have managed to foil an assassination attempt on Shefqet Vërlaci by the Unity Party. The assassin was caught by the gendarmerie and all who were directly involved with the plot have been implicated."
albania.28.a:0 "Thankfully, the situation was handled well."

albania.29.t:0 "Crushing the Opposition"
albania.29.d:0 "We've tolerated democratic rabble rousers within the nation for far too long. It is time we end the power of opposition and begin transfer and consolidation of power into the hands of those who truly deserve it: the aristocracy. All of the opposition parties in Albania shall be disbanded and the aristocracy shall reign supreme for we are what truly make Albania the great nation that it currently is."
albania.29.a:0 "Long live the aristocracy!"

albania.30.t:0 "The [GetYear] Albanian Elections"
albania.30.d:0 "The [GetYear] Albanian Elections have finally begun, with the people on the edge of their seats, eager to see the victor of the elections. As usual, the two parties that have the greatest chance of winning are the social democratic Unity Party and the social conservative Progressive Party. The votes have been officially counted and the winner has come out to be..."
albania.30.a:0 "The Unity Party!"
albania.30.b:0 "The Progressive Party!"

albania.31.t:0 "Alliance Offer From Albania?"
albania.31.d:0 "News has come from the an Albanian delegation; apparently, they seek to form an alliance with us. While we had been the first nation to recognise their independence during the Weltkrieg, Albania is not a nation strong enough to help assist us in any potential conflicts. Though the fact remains that any aid in our favour could prove to be a smart choice down the line. What say we?"
albania.31.a:0 "Accept the offer; we could use the help."
albania.31.b:0 "Reject the offer; we've no time for them."

albania.32.t:0 "Romania Has Accepted Our Offer!"
albania.32.d:0 "We've just received great news from the Romanians: they've accepted our offer of an Albanian-Romanian alliance. This will certainly help further our foreign policy goals and ensure that we can protect ourselves from neighbouring countries which eagerly await our downfall."
albania.32.a:0 "Great!"

albania.33.t:0 "Romania Has Rejected Our Offer!"
albania.33.d:0 "Bad news has just come from the Romanians: apparently, they've rejected our offer of an alliance, citing our precarious position in the Balkans as grounds for rejection."
albania.33.a:0 "How dare they!"

albania.34.t:0 "An Offer of Friendship From the Albanians"
albania.34.d:0 "In an attempt to cultivate ties and further expand their influence on the world stage, the Albanians have approached us in hopes of deepening Albanian-Egyptian relations. Seeing as the royal family has Albanian origins, the fact that Albania is a Muslim nation, and our common enmity towards the Ottomans, it is only natural that we accept their approach."
albania.34.a:0 "Send word to our new friends!"

albania.35.t:0 "Successful Delegation to Egypt!"
albania.35.d:0 "Word has arrived from the Albanian embassy in Egypt that our efforts of cultivating ties between our two nations has been a monumental success. Citing the Albanian origins of the Egyptian royal family, shared religious heritage, alongside mutual enmity towards the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptians received our offer of friendship rather well."
albania.35.a:0 "A rather joyous occasion!"

albania.36.t:0 "An Offer of Friendship From the Albanians"
albania.36.d:0 "In an attempt to cultivate ties and further expand their influence on the world stage, the Albanians have approached us in hopes of deepening Albanian-Sicilian relations. Seeing as there exist a large group of Albanian expats within the Two Sicilies, it is only natural that we accept their advances."
albania.36.a:0 "Send word to our new friends!"

albania.37.t:0 "Successful Delegation to the Two Sicilies!"
albania.37.d:0 "Word has arrived from the Albanian embassy in the Two Sicilies that our efforts of cultivating ties between our two nations has been a monumental success. Citing the presence of Tosk Albanians within the nation, the Sicilians received our offer of friendship rather well."
albania.37.a:0 "A rather joyous occasion!"

albania.38.t:0 "The Reclamation of Kosovo"
albania.38.d:0 "Kosovo, the home of the Albanian National Awakening, has been in the hands of the treacherous Serbians for far too long. The land itself is rightfully Albanian, with most, if not all, of the inhabitants considering themselves to, rightfully, be ethnically Albanian. For years, we have had to sit idly, allowing the Serbians to hold on to the area. That ends today."
albania.38.a:0 "Long live Albania!"

albania.39.t:0 "Albania Has Attacked Us!"
albania.39.d:0 "In a surprising move, the Albanians have declared war against us in an attempt to secure the rightful Serbian territory of Kosovo which they claim is Albanian. The territory has been with us ever since we had secured a victory against the Ottoman Empire following the conclusion of the Balkan Wars. It is only rightful that we retain the land and we shall do so."
albania.39.a:0 "We shall never surrender!"

albania.40.t:0 "Partisan Attack on Newly Established German Schools!"
albania.40.d:0 "In an attempt to oppose, and destroy, the newly established German schools, Albanian nationalist partisans have taken to vandalising and destroying the property, hoping to scare us off and prevent us from building and funding the construction of German schools."
albania.40.a:0 "They shall not succeed!"

albania.41.t:0 "Vërlaci Has Been Killed!"
albania.41.d:0 "In a surprising event for both the common Albanian and international observers, the assassination attempt on Shefqet Vërlaci has managed to succeed, with the former president of Albania being killed and the Unity Party, led by Avni Rustemi, assuming power. Today is a dark day, for many Albanians, while having an intense dislike of Vërlaci, do not view the Unity Party as the rightful leaders of Albania..."
albania.41.a:0 "It will take time to cement our rule."
albania.41.b:0 "Zogu performs a Counter-Coup!"

albania.42.t:0 "Vërlaci Has Survived!"
albania.42.d:0 "Thankfully, the assassin, who many had already expected to fail, has not managed to kill [Root.GetLeader], who is safe, yet still harmed, and recovering. The people who had hired the assassin, namely, the Unity Party, and the assassin himself have all been purged with Fan Noli now in charge of the declining party."
albania.42.a:0 "Today is a joyous occasion!"

albania.43.t:0 "Rustemi Has Been Killed!"
albania.43.d:0 "In a surprising event for both the common Albanian and international observers, the assassination attempt on Avni Rustemi has managed to succeed, with the former president of Albania being killed and the Progressive Party, led by Shefqet Vërlaci, assuming power. Today is a dark day, for many Albanians, who had held high views of Rustemi, do not view the Unity Party as the rightful leaders of Albania..."
albania.43.a:0 "It will take time to cement our rule."

albania.44.t:0 "Rustemi Has Survived!"
albania.44.d:0 "Thankfully, the assassin, who many had already expected to fail, has not managed to kill [Root.GetLeader], who is safe, yet still harmed, and recovering. The people who had hired the assassin, namely, the Progressive Party, and the assassin himself have all been purged with Ahmet Zogu now in charge of the declining party."
albania.44.a:0 "Today is a joyous occasion!"

albania.45.t:0 "Wied's Privy Council"
albania.45.d:0 "Due to the beginning of the reversal of the current republican institutions, it is important that we begin to find substitutes for the former establishments that had previously existed prior to our reign. Wied's privy council, which had existed during the days of the Principality of Albania, has once more been assembled to help advise the king and help better direct the nation. Loyal and qualified members have been chosen to join the council."
albania.45.a:0 "This will be a great boon."

albania.46.t:0 "Redistribution of Land to Catholics"
albania.46.d:0 "In order to help better win over the loyalty of Albanians, and take power away from those who pose a threat to our rule, we must turn our attention the Catholics living within Albania. As it stands, those who hold power in Albania are the landowners, the majority of which are Muslim. By taking away their land, and redistributing it to the Catholics, we can better win them over. This does, of course, come with the risk of angering the aristocrats, particularly the Progressive Party."
albania.46.a:0 "The redistribution must go forth."

albania.47.t:0 "Cementing Our Power"
albania.47.d:0 "It is clear that we must cement our rule if we are to retain control of the ever turbulent and chaotic nation that is known as Albania. To do so, we shall shut down all organised opposition that may, in the short and long term, pose any sort of threat to us. Of course, this will most certainly not please Albanian nationalists and pro-republicans within the nation."
albania.47.a:0 "So be it."

albania.48.t:0 "Partisan Attacks!"
albania.48.d:0 "Partisans, who have not taken kindly to the current changes that we've made, have begun to attack various important buildings in an attempt to force us to reverse our policies. This does not come as a shock, as we've prepared for this eventuality, but it still sets us back."
albania.48.a:0 "Blasted nationalists."

albania.49.t:0 "More Partisan Attacks!"
albania.49.d:0 "Partisans have continued to mercilessly attack us, this time focusing their efforts on taking out crucial supply lines which better help us equip troops so as to deal with them. This has set us back by quite a bit and will take some time to recover from."
albania.49.a:0 "Blasted nationalists."

albania.50.t:0 "Sabotage Against Austrian Companies"
albania.50.d:0 "Albanian nationalists and anti-Austrians have taken to sabotaging new Austrian companies that have begun to set local branches in Albania, intending on driving away foreign businesses. This does not bode well for us."
albania.50.a:0 "We must stand firm in the face of destruction."

albania.51.t:0 "German Schools Showing Progress"
albania.51.d:0 "Due to pursuing our policy of instating and running German schools, alongside making sure that education within Albania, specifically with regards to the attendance of these schools, is compulsory, we have managed to lower illiteracy rates by a great amount. This will, of course, greatly assist us in our efforts in that it will help bring about a more educated, and loyal, populace."
albania.51.a:0 "Rejoice!"

albania.52.t:0 "Albanian Oil Shipments"
albania.52.d:0 "Due to our control over Albania, with the installation of William of Wied, we have managed to procure oil shipments from Albanian which will most certainly assist us economically in that it will boost our overall industrial production."
albania.52.a:0 "Excellent."

albania.53.t:0 "End of Albanian Oil Shipments"
albania.53.d:0 "As we've now lost control over Albania, with William of Wied no longer on the throne, all oil shipments have been terminated, which means we no longer receive any sort of oil from Albania. No matter how minor, this will be an economic setback."
albania.53.a:0 "Damn..."

albania.54.t:0 "Attempted Assassination of Wied!"
albania.54.d:0 "We should have seen this coming with the recent reforms that have been implemented. While the partisans had only acted against things that had directly affected Albania, such as new schools and the abolition of republican institutions, an assassin has been hired in order to take out Wied and liberate Albania from the Austrian rule. If Wied dies, this could prove to be disastrous for everybody involved!"
albania.54.a:0 "The assassin takes the shot and..."

albania.55.t:0 "Wied Has Been Killed!"
albania.55.d:0 "News has reached us from Albania that Wied has been killed and all of our efforts to subjugate the nation have failed, with nationalists taking matters into their own hands and seizing power! What shall we do?"
albania.55.a:0 "We shall not stand for this!"
albania.55.b:0 "We are not ready for war..."

albania.56.t:0 "Dealing With the Partisan Threat"
albania.56.d:0 "In order to rid ourselves of the continuous attacks on various buildings, officials, and other institutions, we must turn our attention to dealing with the partisan threat that currently exists. In order to make our jobs easier, we would do well to ask the Gendarmerie to assist us in our endeavours. With all said and done, however, we have no guarantee of their acceptance..."
albania.56.a:0 "We eagerly await their decision."

albania.57.t:0 "Chasing Down the Partisans"
albania.57.d:0 "We have found trace of the partisans near key supply lines and other areas containing crucial infrastructure. While they had managed to escape before we had caught them in the act, this shows signs of good progress, and will, hopefully, lead us to them."
albania.57.a:0 "Here's hoping."

albania.58.t:0 "Continual Partisan Attacks!"
albania.58.d:0 "Traces of partisan attacks have, yet again, been detected with more crucial supply lines and railways being destroyed or broken beyond recognition. It seems as though the hunt to chasing down these fiends will continue."
albania.58.a:0 "No matter, they shall be found!"

albania.59.t:0 "Catching the Partisans"

Sweeping Powers have been granted to the President, including the powers to appoint one-third of the upper house, censor the media and many other extensive powers. In all terms, Zogu is the dictator of Albania. However, Zog and other allies seek to sweep away the entire system, replacing the Legislature and making Zogu King Zog I. "

albania.69.t:0 "Ahmet Zogu Proclaimed as King Zog I"
albania.69.d:0 "The time has come, the Legislature is out of the way and the new Constituent Assembly officially amended the constitution, and officially made Albania a Kingdom. Now, President Ahmet Zogu has been proclaimed as King Zog I, King of the Albanians. Albania has now been transformed into a Monarchy, and even though Zog is officially a Constitutional Monarch, the Nation is still a de-facto Military Dictatorship and Political Opponents to Zog are frequently arrested or killed. "
albania.69.a:0 "Long Live the King!"

albania.70.t:0 "A New Political Situation"
albania.70.d:0 "Albania has been through many changes since Ahmet Zogu was elected President, and one of the main changes is the erosion of democratic elements. Albania is practically a Military Dictatorship, and opposition is punished; however, Zog continues to swear an oath to defend the constitution and exercise his power as a Constitutional Monarch. This has led to a delicate balance of power within the legislature, between the Semi-Absolute power of King Zog, and the parliament, a power that could easily be tipped one way or another based off of the King’s Will."

The Albanian people rejoice, for they live prosperous lives in the golden age King Zog has ushered in. Our nation, our armies, and our people are more prideful than ever before, and yet there still exists a small hole in King Zog’s heart - the void of one last unfulfilled desire. \n\nFar across the Mediterranean and past the stormy Atlantic lies the tropical paradise of Brazil - a chaotic but wondrous land that has been the fixation for our glorious king for quite some time. Despite holding no claim to this Amazonian eden, King Zog and his beloved wife Geralidne have lusted after this verdant patch since before his coronation, and now, with the people satisfied and the nation more secure than ever, our beloved royal family decided to treat themselves. Seeking to surprise his wife on their anniversary, King Zog had purchased a large mansion and estate along the northern coasts near the mouth of the Amazon on a property as secluded as it was beautiful. Paying an immense premium on it, Zog was set to reveal the gift when officials from Brazil had arrived at his palace in Tirana, coming to congratulate him on his new purchase. \n\nIt would seem that through a baffling clerical error only possible in the hellish nightmare that is Brazil’s bureaucracy, King Zog had not purchased an Amazonian estate for his wife, but in fact had purchased the entire nation of Brazil instead, and now the Albanian Crown was the legal owner over all of Brazil. With the King still hoping to give a wondrous gift to his beautiful wife and queen, it was now up to the heir of Skanderbeg to choose the fate of the Brazilian nation."

ALB_Resist_Austria:0"Resist Austria"
ALB_Resist_Austria_desc:0"For Long Austria has tried to influence Albania from the shadows, and this is something we simply can not allow. Albania must strongly stand against Austria and it’s sphere, to ensure that Albania is free; and that the man on the throne is Zog I, not Wilhelm Weid. "

ALB_Closen_Islamic_Ties_desc:0"While Zog has been ostracized by the other European Royal Houses, the Islamic Houses have been more than happy to cooperate and establish relations with Zog.

ALB_Cult_of_Personality_desc:0"The King has now begun to harness the Cult of Personality that is growing around him, as now the Royalist Fanatics have been fully integrated into the Government, and vast parades and celebrations are being held in Honor of the King.

ALB_Destroy_Socialist_Opposition:0"Destroy Socialist Opposition"

ALB_Legitimacy_Secured_desc:0"Due to the successful reforms of King Zog, we are no longer laughed off of the world stage.

### Ideas ###
ALB_black_monday_idea:0 "Black Monday"
ALB_black_monday_idea_desc:0 "Even Albania was unable to escape the economic devastation incurred by many nations due to Black Monday, one of the worst economic crashes in history. Unless we undertake large scale reforms, such as agrarian reform, industrialise the nation, balance the budget, reform the bank, and utilise the Albanian land and Albanian people to the fullest extent, we cannot hope to escape this dreadful crash. Let us hope we can do so."
ALB_black_monday_idea2:0 "Black Monday"
ALB_black_monday_idea2_desc:0 "Even Albania was unable to escape the economic devastation incurred by many nations due to Black Monday, one of the worst economic crashes in history. Unless we undertake large scale reforms, such as agrarian reform, industrialise the nation, balance the budget, and utilise the Albanian land and Albanian people to the fullest extent, we cannot hope to escape this dreadful crash.

ALB_black_monday_idea3:0 "Black Monday"
ALB_black_monday_idea3_desc:0 "Even Albania was unable to escape the economic devastation incurred by many nations due to Black Monday, one of the worst economic crashes in history. Unless we undertake large scale reforms, such as agrarian reform, industrialise the nation, reform the bank, and utilise the Albanian land and Albanian people to the fullest extent, we cannot hope to escape this dreadful crash. Let us hope we can do so."
ALB_black_monday_idea4:0 "Black Monday"
ALB_black_monday_idea4_desc:0 "Even Albania was unable to escape the economic devastation incurred by many nations due to Black Monday, one of the worst economic crashes in history. Unless we undertake large scale reforms, such as agrarian reform, industrialise the nation, and utilise the Albanian land and Albanian people to the fullest extent, we cannot hope to escape this dreadful crash. Let us hope we can do so."
ALB_land_reform_idea:0 "Land Reform"
ALB_land_reform_idea_desc:0 "By instituting agrarian reform and redistributing the land held by the aristocratic landowners to regular Albanians, we can slowly ween ourselves off of the current farming aristocracy that has developed and empower the peasant farmers within our nation. Of course, the aristocrats are not pleased, and may fight back..."
ALB_farming_techniques_idea:0 "New Farming Techniques"
ALB_farming_techniques_idea_desc:0 "Peasant farmers in Albania have relied upon using wooden ploughs and subsistence farming for far too long. This has had a negative impact on our economy, in that our agricultural output and exports are not as high as they could have been. By upgrading the methods employed by farmers and the tools used, we can increase both the agricultural output of Albania and improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of Albanians."
ALB_illiteracy:0 "Mass Illiteracy"
ALB_illiteracy_desc:0 "Education in Albania is very poor, with eighty percent of the population illiterate. In addition, education is neither compulsory nor does Albania have any formal university. The only group of people within our nation to possess some sort of education are the aristocrats, meaning that we are severely behind our European counterparts when it comes to research and are viewed as a backwater. Separate Turkish schools for Muslims and Greek schools for Orthodox Christians have not helped this issue one bit."
ALB_illiteracy2:0 "Illiteracy"
ALB_illiteracy2_desc:0 "While we have taken steps to solve the problem of illiteracy, with creating Albanian schools for Albanians, the problem of education not being compulsory alongside Albania's lack of higher education facilities remains."
ALB_economic_boom_idea:0 "Economic Boom"
ALB_economic_boom_idea_desc:0 "We have managed to successfully combat the effects of Black Monday and have, by extension, brought upon an economic golden age to Albania. Agricultural output is high, industrialisation has improved both our economic output and activity, the living conditions of the average Albanian have improved, and the people are no longer oppressed. Long live Albania!"
ALB_economic_miracle_idea:0 "Economic Miracle"
ALB_economic_miracle_idea_desc:0 "Through the use of deflation measures, improving the conditions of sharecroppers, granting companies tax incentives to open branches in Albania, and general increased agricultural output, we have managed to bring about an economic golden age to Albania, with some dubbing the event as the Albanian Economic Miracle."
ALB_polarised_nation_idea:0 "Polarised Nation"
ALB_polarised_nation_idea_desc:0 "With the establishment of an independent Albania, two parties in Albania have managed to take power. The social democratic Unity Party led by Avni Rustemi and the social conservative Progressive Party led by Shefqet Vërlaci. With the two parties having differing goals, yet both having vast influence, it's no wonder that, in recent years, Albania has become such a politically polarised nation..."
ALB_feudal_system_ended:0 "Dissolution of the Feudal System"
ALB_feudal_system_ended_desc:0 "We have managed to free the common Albanians from the yoke of the aristocrats and landowners, giving them free will and free reign over their own lives. This is truly a momentous and glorious day for the common man!"
ALB_arm_of_gendarmerie_idea:0 "Arm of Gendarmerie"
ALB_arm_of_gendarmerie_idea_desc:0 "Investment into the Arm of Gendarmerie is crucial if we are to protect Albania from elements that seek to destroy and/or destabilise it from both within and without."

ALB_fund_bank_idea:0 "Funding the Bank"
ALB_fund_bank_idea_desc:0 "By incentivising the wealthy to invest in the banks, we can fill up the state's coffer and better carry out the function of the bank while assisting companies and/or nobles who need the money."
ALB_increased_agricultural_output_idea:0 "Increased Agricultural Output"
ALB_increased_agricultural_output_idea_desc:0 "By introducing new farming methods to our peasant farmers and sharecroppers, thereby weening them off of subsistence farming, we can ensure that they produce for not only themselves but for the state and the landowners, increasing our agricultural output as a whole."
ALB_deflation_measures_idea:0 "Deflation Measures"
ALB_deflation_measures_idea_desc:0 "By removing a certain amount of lek from circulation, we can ensure that we can better deal with the effects of inflation caused by Black Monday and stabilise our currency. This will come at the cost of lower production capabilities, however."
ALB_universal_health_care_idea:0 "Universal Health Care"
ALB_universal_health_care_idea_desc:0 "Fan Noli's idea of universal health care, funded by the state through taxes, will help improve living conditions for regular Albanians alongside assisting the stabilisation of the birth rate."
ALB_assert_sovereignty_idea:0 "Assert Albanian Sovereignty"
ALB_assert_sovereignty_idea_desc:0 "We shall never let Albania fall to the Austrian or Serbian menace! We shall unite Albanians all around the world and ensure that Albania remains stable, free, and democratic for centuries! Long live Albania and long live the Albanian people!"
ALB_civil_liberties_idea:0 "Extended Civil Liberties"
ALB_civil_liberties_idea_desc:0 "Granting extended rights and liberties to our people who have been oppressed by the upper class for far too long is paramount to the reformation of a democratic, just, and free Albania."
ALB_tax_incentives_idea:0 "Tax Incentives"
ALB_tax_incentives_idea_desc:0 "Granting businesses special privileges and tax incentives will help convince them to open up local branches in Albania, thereby increasing our economic activity while making us an attractive investment option to potential investors."
ALB_liberal_republic_idea:0 "Liberalisation"
ALB_liberal_republic_idea_desc:0 "The Unity Party has finally done what it had originally set out to do and has now made Albania a liberal and westernised republic. No longer shall we lag behind other nations politically and economically. No longer shall our people at the bottom of the ladder suffer. We are a free and democratic nation. Long live Albania and long live the Albanian people!"
ALB_trade_with_bulgaria_idea:0 "Albanian-Bulgarian Trade"

ALB_assassinated_leader_idea:0 "Political Coup"
ALB_assassinated_leader_idea_desc:0 "While we have managed to secure power, in one way or another, our rule is not recognised as legitimate by the people due to us having acquired power through the use of assassination and coups. In addition, we have destabilised Albania and have disrupted the balance of power. Adjustment will take some time."
ALB_gave_austria_oil:0 "Albanian Oil"
ALB_gave_austria_oil_desc:0 "We have managed to procure Albanian oil due to our control over the nation. This will certainly be an economic boon in that it will help boost our industrial production."
ALB_hydroelectricity_idea:0 "Hydroelectricity"
ALB_hydroelectricity_idea_desc:0 "Through harnessing the potential energy of our rivers through the use of dams, we can allow for the production of cheap energy within our nation, thereby providing all Albanians with access to energy."
ALB_Legitimacy_idea:0"Legitimate Kingdom"
ALB_Legitimacy_idea_desc:0"Due to the successful reforms of King Zog, we are no longer laughed off of the world stage. We are a respected Kingdom, and now every European House, from the Hapsburgs to the Hohenzollerns regard us as just as legitimate as any other.

ALB_cultivate_egyptian_ties:0 "Cultivate Egyptian Ties"
ALB_cultivate_egyptian_ties_desc:0 "The Egyptian royal family possess Albanian origins and would take kindly to our efforts to improve relations between our two nations. Approaching them would be a natural, and smart, move."
ALB_reignite_romanian_friendship:0 "Reignite Romanian Friendship"
ALB_reignite_romanian_friendship_desc:0 "With the Romanian royal family now back on the throne, we can begin to slowly reignite our friendship with the Romanians, who were first nation to recognise Albanian independence and one of the first nations to formally establish relations with us."
ALB_the_tosk_albanians:0 "The Tosk Albanians"
ALB_the_tosk_albanians_desc:0 "The Arbëreshë people, or the Tosk Albanians, are people living in southern Italy who had fled Albania when the Ottoman Empire had conquered the nation and began to convert its citizens to Islam. They have managed to preserve their own culture and language, the Arbëresh language. Seeking to connect with them may also help us with the establishment of ties with the Two Sicilies."
ALB_foster_relations_with_bulgaria:0 "Foster Relations with Bulgaria"

ALB_the_fight_for_kosovo:0 "The Fight for Kosovo"
ALB_the_fight_for_kosovo_desc:0 "The Ottomans had ceded Kosovo, an area that was the centre of the Albanian National Awakening, to the Serbians following conclusion of the Balkan Wars. The vast majority of people living in the area are of Albanian background and wish to see themselves liberated from the Serbian imperialism. We must take back Kosovo, no matter the cost."

ALB_economic_policy_decisions:0 "Economic Policy"
ALB_economic_policy_decisions_desc:0 "We must make Albania an economically and financially sound nation. The only way we can do so, however, is by pushing for the investment in new types of resources and the creation of new factories. In addition, it is also important that we take into account our rural population as well."
ALB_hydroelectricity:0 "Hydroelectricity"
ALB_hydroelectricity_desc:0 "We must consider Albania's reputation within the international community. Because we are seen as a poor, backwater nation, it is clear that we must take steps to change that. By allowing for the creation of dams and power plants, we can ensure affordable energy is brought to all parts of Albania; rural or otherwise."
ALB_fier_county_oil_drilling:0 "Fier Country Oil Drilling"
ALB_fier_county_oil_drilling_desc:0 "Many of the towns and cities within Fier County, such as Patos-Marinza and Drizë, have proven their worth in terms of resource richness in that they've yielded to us vast amounts of oil. If we continue upon the path of drilling around Fier County, perhaps we may get lucky and find more oil."
ALB_emergency_food_aid:0 "Emergency Food Aid"
ALB_emergency_food_aid_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector has been largely left to wither and fail following the collapse of the Berlin Stock Exchange.

If we do not provide support to these people, we may face rioting."

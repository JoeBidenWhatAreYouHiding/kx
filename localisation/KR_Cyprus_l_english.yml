### Events ###
cyp.1.t:0 "Cyprus declares Independence"
cyp.1.d:0 "Only recently returned to the Porte, the Cypriots have sensed a moment of weakness and have decided to exploit it. Protestors stormed the government buildings in Nicosia as is the hills and forests of the island, guerilla fighters (likely backed by Greece) are fighting against the overwhelmed Turkish garrisons.\n\nCalling for Enosis or the unification with Greece, the rebels have already openly called on the Greek government to intervene and absorb the island within its domain. Turkish Cypriots in the meanwhile find themselves torn between the two sides as their loyalty to Cyprus is in contradiction with their loyalty to the Turkish regime in Konstantiniyye."
cyp.1.a:0 "Hoist the blue flag! (Play as Cyprus)"
cyp.1.b:0 "Nonsense, you will remain Kibris and that will be end of it"

cyp.2.t:0 "Rhodos joins the revolt"
cyp.2.d:0 "The islands of the Dodecanese have decided to throw their lot in with the Cypriots as the combination of further calls for enosis and recent decisions by the Ottoman government concerning the status of the islands have made all mediation impossible. Just as on Cyprus however, the islands have a sizeable muslim population which is less than thrilled by their calls for unification with Greece."
cyp.2.a:0 "Unfortunate"

cyp.3.t:0 "Lesbos joins the revolt"
cyp.3.d:0 "In sympathy with their compatriots in Cyprus, a variety of Greek islands in the Northern Aegean have joined the revolt. Ousting their Ottoman garrisons, the people have taken up arms in a stance of defiance rivalling that of the Turkish-Greek war over a century ago.\n\nNaval bases of the Turkish regime have suffered considerable damage as the Aegean squadron was forced to evacuate after a terrorist bombing on the Sisam cruiser earlier this week. Opening up the Dardanelles to the Greek fleet, the loss of these islands is seen as a strategic calamity for the defence of the capital and naval superiority in the Aegean."
cyp.3.a:0 "Unfortunate"

cyp.4.t:0 "The Cyclades join the revolt"
cyp.4.d:0 "Formerly known for providing shelter to the pirates of the Aegean, the predominately catholic islands of the Cyclades have decided to cast of their shackles as well. Predominately started by Greek Orthodox residents of the islands, the catholic population has not fully decided to aid the rebels as fear of Orthodox domination on the islands is not fully seen as a better alternative to Turkish government.\nThe industrial capacity of the islands however and the naval facilities they provided are another huge loss for the ailing Porte as they will greatly contribute to the power of the Greek revolt."
cyp.4.a:0 "Unfortunate"

cyp.5.t:0 "Colonel George Grivas leaves for Cyprus"
cyp.5.d:0 "Grivas, born in 1898 in the village of Trikomo about fifty kilometers northeast of Nicosia, is the son of a grain merchant. After elementary education in the village school, he was sent to the Pancyprian Gymnasium. Reportedly a good student, Grivas went to Athens at age seventeen to enter the Greek Military Academy. Steadily climbing the ranks after the Weltkrieg, he became a lieutenant colonel stationed on the Bulgarian frontier.\n\nNow that Cyprus has declared its independence, the man has submitted his resignation from the army and taken a boat for Cyprus to fight for the liberation of his people. A massive proponent of Enosis, it is no secret that he will do everything in his power to ensure that Cyprus is reunited with Greece."
cyp.5.a:0 "Good luck!"

cyp.6.t:0 "Ex-Colonel George Grivas arrives on Cyprus"
cyp.6.d:0 "Grivas, born in 1898 in the village of Trikomo about fifty kilometers northeast of Nicosia, is the son of a grain merchant. After elementary education in the village school, he was sent to the Pancyprian Gymnasium. Reportedly a good student, Grivas went to Athens at age seventeen to enter the Greek Military Academy. Steadily climbing the ranks after the Weltkrieg, he became a lieutenant colonel stationed on the Bulgarian frontier.\n\nNow that Cyprus has declared its independence, the man has submitted his resignation from the army and taken a boat for Cyprus to fight for the liberation of his people. A massive proponent of Enosis, it is no secret that he will do everything in his power to ensure that Cyprus is reunited with Greece. Due to the dominance of Turkish Cypriots in the Ottoman garisson on the island, this also makes him one of the only people in the rebellion with military experience which has seen him appointed chief of army of the entire rebel force in no time at all."
cyp.6.a:0 "Greece shall be united!"

cyp.7.t:0 "Cypriot War of Independence"
cyp.7.d:0 "Restored to Turkish rule after the collapse of the British Empire only a decade prior, the Cypriots saw this return as an insult to their Greek character. Calls for Enosis or union with Greece only increased and as the regime in Konstantiniyye took the necessary steps to ensure Cypriot selfrule would never happen, a group of Greek patriots with the support of the church finally took this chance as their moment to shine.\n\nWith over 20% of the population ethnically Turkish however and with little capacity for the Cypriot movement to stand on its own, the whole revolt depends on the support of Greece. Word has it that the Greek government is already preparing a statement concerning the matter but many fear that Greece will shun away from direct intervention, fearful of the much superior Turkish army and navy."
cyp.7.a:0 "We call on Hellas!"

cyp.8.t:0 "Cyprus demands Enosis"
cyp.8.d:0 "Catching our government mostly by surprise, the sudden declaration of independence by the island of Cyprus has been the talk of the day ever since archbishop Leontios II declared an end to Turkish rule a week ago. The objective of the revolt is clear as all its leaders demand the immediate unification with Greece and are calling on us to secure that as fast as possible.\n\nMany Greeks have also openly announced their support for a direct intervention in the matter but over in Athens, [GRE.GetLeader] is unsure that Greece should attack the Turks at this moment as their numerical, industrial and naval superiority would make any operations reckless unless planned very thoroughly."
cyp.8.a:0 "And Greece answers!"
cyp.8.b:0 "Support the rebels"
cyp.8.c:0 "We can't risk it..."

cyp.9.t:0 "Greece invades the Ottoman Empire"
cyp.9.d:0 "In full support of our actions the Greek government has decided to intervene directly in the conflict. After sending a short ultimatum to the Turkish government, [GRE.GetLeader] officially declared war on the Sublime Porte earlier today."
cyp.9.a:0 "Down with the Turks! (Play as Greece)"

cyp.10.t:0 "Greece sends aid"
cyp.10.d:0 "Whilst refraining from taking an offical position in the war, the Greek government has sent us an abundance of support in the hopes of avoiding a quick Turkish counterattack. Guns, bandages, food and volunteers are flooding in through the ports of Cyprus as the war continues to drag on."
cyp.10.a:0 "We are grateful"

cyp.11.t:0 "Greece abandons us"
cyp.11.d:0 "The Greek government has earlier today decided to stop all assistance sent to our rebellion and has sent the Porte a telegram that they will not pursue an agressive policy towards it. With no backing and rebuked by our Greek brethren, it seems unlikely the revolt will last much longer."
cyp.11.a:0 "So ends the dream of Enosis..."

cyp.12.t:0 "Greece offers peace"
cyp.12.d:0 "In an effort to prevent further bloodshed, the government in Athens has extended us a possible olive branch. Demanding the full retreat of Ottoman forces from the Greek islands and the relinquishment of our claims on said islands, the Greeks have decided to abandon their ambitions on Smyrna and Trebizond and sign a full peace treaty with our empire.\n\nIt goes without saying that conceding to the Greeks would be a widely impopular move and could open the path to even more secession groups but as almost all our borders are now under immediate threats, we may find ourselves with no choice in the matter."
cyp.12.a:0 "We accept their offer"
cyp.12.b:0 "Kibris is ours!"

cyp.13.t:0 "[OTT.GetName] refuses our demands"
cyp.13.d:0 "Refusing to acknowledge our control over the Aegean Islands and Cyprus, [OTT.GetLeader] has thrown out our offer for peace and instead ramped up operations against our forces in the region. In Trebizond and Smyrna, Greeks are threading carefully as a repeat of the Weltkrieg is becoming a greater risk by the day."
cyp.13.a:0 "They chose...poorly"

cyp.14.t:0 "Cypriot Revolt stands succesful"
cyp.14.d:0 "With the Ottoman menace dealt with, the people of Cyprus can now finally breath in true freedom. Arrangements to merge the rebel state with Hellas itself are fully underway as a victory parade is held both in Nicosia and Athens to celebrate the joyous occasion whilst heroes and veterans of the war are being personally decorated by [GRE.GetLeader]."
cyp.14.a:0 "This is a great day for all Greeks!"

### Ideas ###
CYP_revolt:0 "Desire for Enosis"
CYP_revolt_desc:0 "Enosis or the unification of Greece and Cyprus has been the centerpoint of Cypriot politics and propaganda for decades. First under the Ottomans, then the British and finally again the Turks, the Greek Orthodox population of the island has been quasi unanimous in their support for the movement."
CYP_revolt2:0 "Desire for Enosis"
CYP_revolt2_desc:0 "Enosis or the unification of Greece and Cyprus has been the centerpoint of Cypriot politics and propaganda for decades. First under the Ottomans, then the British and finally again the Turks, the Greek Orthodox population of the island has been quasi unanimous in their support for the movement."
CYP_turkish_cypriots:0 "Divided Loyalties"
CYP_turkish_cypriots_desc:0 "Whilst the Greek population of the Greek Isles does not hide their aversion to the Turkish regime, the situation is substantially different for the Turkish population of these islands. Turkish Cypriots and other muslim groups spread out over isles such as Rhodos don't share their compatriots desire for a quick union with Greece and would rather continue to live and work within the Ottoman framework than partake in a strictly Christian nation wherein they would be an insignificant minority."
CYP_revolt_no_support:0 "Revolt Unsupported"
CYP_revolt_no_support_desc:0 "Calamity has struck as the Greek government has refused to send any assistance to the Cypriot revolt. In consequence this has ruined any hopes of enosis and has doomed all efforts undertaken by the rebels. The Turkish Cypriot issue has further been amplified by this as their calls for an immediate end to the revolt have only increased, now with support from many of the Greek Cypriots."
CYP_revolt_support:0 "Cypriot Assistance"
CYP_revolt_support_desc:0 "Greek arsenals and war factories are running overtime as ship after ship filled with equipement leaves for the island of Cyprus. We may have decided to not openly risk the ire of the Sultan but his day will soon come and before that day, we will do everything in our power to support the efforts of our Greek brethren."

KIK_Mountain_Deferred:0 "The Mountain Deferred"
KIK_Mountain_Deferred_desc:0 "For 11 years the KLFA has held out in Wajir and on Mt. Kenya. Now though, things seem to have progressed to their final stage. We are surrounded, outnumbered and outgunned."
KIK_Revisionist_Pariah:0 "Internationale's Doubting Son"
KIK_Revisionist_Pariah_desc:0 "While the European theoreticians hoped that the Mau-Mau would usher in a new era of Syndicalism on the Dark Continent they have had their foolish neo-colonialist hopes quickly dashed. For our leadership understands that only by adapting a truly National Syndicalism the people of Kenya can be free. This state of beings has led to the Paris-London Axis viewing our valiant fighters as a lost cause, unable to truly grasp their Eurocentric Socialism."
KIK_Maumau:0 "The Mau-Mau Bush War"
KIK_Maumau_desc:0 "The Anglos of Nairobi and Kampala, most of the time being too busy licking the German boots, continue to wage war against us. Despite our valiant efforts the white devils have us surrounded, and many fear it's only a matter of time before all of our brave fighters have been slaughtered."
KIK_onlyobama:0 "The Avatar of the Ghost Goat"
KIK_onlyobama_desc:0 "The Mzee Onyango Obama is seen as the living incarnation of the Mau Mau’s leading deity the Ghost Goat. Due to this relationship, he and the other leading Field Marshals - hand selected by the Mau Mau elder priesthood in secretive occultist rituals that Obama now leads - are the only and final say in the nation, with their word being binding by law, both spiritually and physically, on penalty of death."
KIK_onlytotalism:0 "The True Incarnation of Totalism"
KIK_onlytotalism_desc:0 "We were the first Totalists, and we shall continue to champion our purified and original conception of the ideology free from the Eurocentric idiocy of the Third Internationale and their Charter. National syndicalist tribalism, Pan-Afrikan social nationalism, and Mau Mau occultic spiritualism are the only ways forward for the Afrikan people, and only Obama’s conception of Totalist perfection can get us all there."

KIK_kikuyu_supremacy_desc_2:0 "As the largest of the Kenyan tribal ethnic groups, as well as being Mathenge’s own bloodline, pro-Kikyuku sentiment will be spread far and wide. Aided by the state, our regime will ensure that the clearly superior Kikuyu dialect, religion, and cultural practices all become beloved and standard across the nation; even if that means other, lesser cultures must be squashed to make room for the Kikuyu’s rightful dominance. To start, we can begin ‘ignoring’ lesser non-Bantu groups within our borders, instead showing them the light of Kikuyu culture."

KIK_cant_research_shit_in_detroit_desc:0 "With the Mau Mau seeing metals, refined or unrefined, as perversions of Mount Kenya and wider Mother Earth linked to bad luck and poor performance on the battlefield when compared to more traditional weapons made of stone and wood, the few firearms in our possession that are made by Mau Mau hands are largely made of wood. This has led to misfires both mundane and deadly becoming a common occurrence among our riflemen, but at least we have some lead to throw down range at the colonial oppressors. Aside from these wooden pistols and rifles fashioned from scraps and spent ammo shells like the famous Eoka pistol, our troops largely rely on captured colonial weapons despite the taboo, and on a large amount of traditional weapons like spears and bows, as well as on the water rituals of our shamans that are said to protect our troops from bullets - if they work."

### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_OBAMA_DESC:0 "For 11 years the Mau-Mau have resisted the colonial forces of Kenya-Uganda. At the head of the resistance is a man by the name of Onyango Obama, the sole salvation of Kenya against imperialist forces. Even though times may seem bleak, the Kenya Land and Freedom Army holds strong, and will do so until the bitter end. Until the end comes, Obama will lead the Mau-Mau against all forces of imperialism, whether they be the Germans or the perfidious Syndicalists based in London or Paris. Obama’s Socialism is not one crafted in the halls of European Elites, but in the heart of Africa. To the enemies of Obama, to the enemies of the People of Africa; no mercy will be shown, no concessions given, and no surrender accepted."

POLITICS_PUNISHED_OBAMA_DESC:0 "After the disastrous climax of the Mau-Mau’s initial revolution, our forces were scattered and slaughtered, mercilessly gunned down by the frontier forces of Kenya-Uganda. Onyango Obama himself was thought to be dead, with his closest associates fleeing into hiding under the command of his right hand man Dedan Kimathi, who has also made sure to save Obama’s only son. What no one knew, however, was that Obama had miraculously survived the battle! Crawling dozens of miles to the nearest safe village while clutching his bleeding gunshot and saber wounds, he limped painfully to safety. Once in the care of local sympathizers, he would plot his revenge as the tribal healers tended to his wounds that would horrifically scar his body for life. Awaiting the perfect day to reveal his survival to his people, the collapse of the bloated Mittelafrikan monstrosity has provided the perfect stage for his return. Once again, Obama marches towards his destiny, seemingly back from the dead, infuriated and more determined than ever before. For the people of Africa, for Totalism, only Obama can be their true salvation."

POLITICS_STANLEY_MATHENGE_DESC:0 "When Mathenge brutally eliminated his rivals for power within Kinyaa, he had no intention of slowing down or stopping there. Now that he is in power, he has plans for his people. With the European imperialists largely out of the picture, Mathenge believes it is time to give the formerly stolen land back to the native populations, who will farm it and tend to it as their ancestors did. For Mathenge, it is more than just revering the traditions of our ancestors; we must also ensure the dominance of the Kikuyus in our part of the continent. To do so, he believes we should bring our weaker neighbors into the fold in order to create a united front against any European who tries to take back this land. Equally as important as this, it is crucial that the influence of European culture and faith is wiped from Africa, and this will be done through force if necessary. Mathenge, though presenting a tough image to the world, only wishes to see his people prosper as they did before the meddlesome hands of outsiders forced their way into the lives of the Kikuyu people. With enough resources at his disposal, and the will to bring the nation into the Modern Era industrially and militarily, he could very well see this desire come to fruition..."

POLITICS_DEDAN_KIMATHI_DESC:0 "Dedan Kimathi, one of the youngest leaders in the entire movement, has beaten his rivals to become the leader of Kinyaa. He has created legitimacy for himself by taking the son of his mentor and former leader, Onyango Obama, into his own care. Now, serving as regent for the young Obama, Kimathi has had no problem articulating his vision to his people. For Kimathi, the implementation of socialism in the nation's agrarian sector is key to seeing its farmers prosper. Further, it would also achieve the goal of returning the land to its rightful owners-the Kenyan people. Meanwhile, Kimathi does not look as unfavorably towards Europeans as his fellow revolutionaries have; as long as they are aligned with the Third Internationale, Kimathi does not care. Instead, he hopes to model his new state partly off of their example and partly off his own beliefs, which entail local democracy for his people and unity among Kenyans. To guarantee the continued existence of his new fragile state, Kimathi has expressed a desire for a strong military and industrial sector alike. With the ability to fend off invaders, both inwardly and from across the ocean, Kimathi can focus on building a strong state for his people."

POLITICS_BABY_OBAMA_DESC:0 "Barack Obama is one of the most interesting figures to have emerged out of the chaos that was the fall of Mittelafrika. Son of the revered hero of Kenya, Onyango Obama, Barack had always lived in the shadow of his father’s legacy and actions, and that of his teacher and predecessor Dedan Kimathi. Having been predestined as the next leader of Kenya from a young age, the stress of such expectations have taken its toll on the young man, making the barely eighteen year old appear even older than his own late father. However, his fiery spirit and eagerness to create a better future for Kenya gives confidence to many, including the retired Kimathi, who is proud of the boy like a father towards his son."

KIK_mau_mau_bush_war_desc:0 "For 11 years we have fought and bled to free Kenya. With the dawn of 1936, we are determined that this will be the last year of the Bush War. We will either be victorious or not be at all."
KIK_resistance_to_the_end:0 "Resistance to the Bitter End"
KIK_resistance_to_the_end_desc:0 "Brothers and sisters in arms, though the world outside has turned against us, we fight on! The Mau-Mau have the spirit to fight the enemy to our last drop of blood! This Resistance shall give no quarter to the colonial reactionaries who seek to destroy our people. The struggle will not end until the Avatar has led us to bring the torch to this Continent, our Continent, not the foreign devils'. If we would fail, which would be impossible if we stand firm as we have up to this point, then the duty of all of Kenyans shall be to resist to the bitter end. The colonial powers shall never subjugate us and our land!"
KIK_call_to_arms:0 "A Call to Rebellion"
KIK_call_to_arms_desc:0 "As we prepare for the final battle, we are going to need more men. Our leadership has greenlit a great propaganda campaign across all of Kenya using any means necessary. Coercion, bribery, appeals to morality and the shared sense of duty and love for our land. By its end, all Kenyans will know that the light of our cause shall soon engulf all of Kenya and banish the white darkness!"
KIK_arms_trade:0 "Blood and Bullets"
KIK_arms_trade_desc:0 "As the final battle approaches ever quicker, we require arms. It is no secret that the Mau-Mau are using highly outdated equipment. It is also no secret that we are quickly running out of bullets. In order to solve this, Obama has agreed to an offer from a mercenary company based out of the Congo. They will provide us with modern equipment. In exchange, we are to take out a few “problem” colonial administrators for them. While some may scoff at this, once they learn the Great Obama is the one who took the deal, they will quickly be silenced."
KIK_fortify_the_mountain:0 "The Mountain's Final Test"
KIK_fortify_the_mountain_desc:0 "Mt. Kenya, the great symbol of both our revolt and people, is a very powerful and moving image to the minds of the Mau-Mau. For us, it shows that while oppression may come, it can never fully destroy our people. The Mountain has been here from the beginning, and will remain so until the end. It is also symbolic of the Great Mountain of the Mau-Mau, our Leader. He stands as our guide, like a lighthouse for the ships at sunless sea. This coming battle will be a great test for the Mountain of the Mau-Mau, but with the unity of our people there is no way the Mountain will fall in the coming storm."
KIK_only_obama:0 "The Goat, the Avatar, and the Sanguine Marshals"
KIK_only_obama_desc:0 "The Ghost Goat is the mythical spirit based on the fringe Kikuyu tribal myth that we Mau Mau venerate as our goddess and master. Though incorporeal and locked away in the realm of the animist spirits, her will is done by the hand of her trusted Marshals - special military and political leaders of the Mau Mau movement such as Stanley Mathenge and Dedan Kimathi that chosen in secretive rituals involving blood consumption and animal sacrifice. Above these Field Marshals - much to the chagrin of some of the more ambitious and less faithful among us - stands the Mzee Onyango Obama, who is believed by many to be the Ghost Goat incarnate as he walks the earth as her avatar. With this divine relationship enshrined, what Obama says is upheld as supreme law both spiritually and physically, and all in the Mau Mau must follow his word. Bound by this spiritual personality cult and supported by these dark spiritual arts thanks to the help of our clique of tribal witch doctors, shamans, and spirit healers among the Kikuyu elders, the Mau Mau may be pursuing a temporal and political revolution, but at our roots we are disciples of the Great Ghost Goat."
KIK_only_totalism:0 "Reshaping the Charter to Afrika’s Needs"
KIK_only_totalism_desc:0 "Totalism: an ideology born not in the halls of some European College, but in the hearts of men who saw the corruption and vanity of Syndicalism and Radical Socialism. Totalism is the only acceptable idea of the White Devil. Without the beauty and purity of Totalism, Obama would not have been able to guide the Mau-Mau with as much success as he has. Even before Totalism was formalized in that blessed Charter, Obama has been following it in his heart, as Totalism is not something that was invented. No, Totalism is inscribed on the hearts of every true African by God, and every true Mau-Mau warrior knows this. Thus it is only with true and Afrikanized Totalism supported by Mau Mau occultism, the greatest and highest of Mankind's ideals, that Africa can be freed."
KIK_only_we_can_be_the_salvation_of_kenya:0 "The Only Saviors of Kenya"
KIK_only_we_can_be_the_salvation_of_kenya_desc:0 "The time has come. What preparations could be done have been undertaken, and we shall wait no longer.

Failure is not an option, let the Avatar and the Marshals bring our Goddess' wrath upon the colonialist scum!"

KIK_second_uprising:0 "A Second Great Uprising"
KIK_second_uprising_desc:0 "Though Obama’s initial uprising was eventually snuffed out and driven back to the mountains and wastes of Kenya’s wilds, it was not a total failure. It planted the seed of rebellion in the hearts of the Kenyan people, and now, in the dying moments of Mittelafrika, we shall once more raise arms against the Kraut. The future is uncertain and chaos surrounds all, but the Second Mau-Mau Revolution shall not falter until all of Kenta is saved!"
KIK_gather_the_guns:0 "Gather New Guns"
KIK_gather_the_guns_desc:0 "If we are to arm the ever-growing number of revolutionaries that continue to flood into our ranks, or even supply the ones we already had, new weapons of war will be needed. However, we have no industry except for the few ‘factories’ captured from the colonizers and our local gunsmiths. We must perform raids deep into enemy territory to steal weapons, while also working to contact black market sources like the Senussi Order or the Triads to requisition more arms."
KIK_push_from_the_mountain:0 "Push From the Mountain"
KIK_push_from_the_mountain_desc:0 "Mount Kenya is both a great symbol of our revolt as well as a serious hub for our revolutionary government, with much of the mountain hiding tunnels and redoubts staffed with brave KFLA militias. Taking our knowledge of this terrain into account, we shall launch surprise attacks from the Kenyan highlands, waging a brutal guerilla war against Nairobi and other major colonialist holdouts that border the mountains. We will bleed them dry!"
KIK_end_the_colonials:0 "End the Colonials!"
KIK_end_the_colonials_desc:0 "The remaining colonists too foolish or unfortunate to be able to escape our nation have begun to group up, forming concentrated pockets of resistance.

KIK_erase_dominionist_kenya_desc:0 "The foul stench of the Anglos and their dead empire permeates everywhere, with even influence from the Kaiserreich forced to bask in the shade of the British dominance here in Kenya.

KIK_liberate_uganda:0 "Fate of Uganda?"
KIK_liberate_uganda_desc:0 "Uganda broke off from the now-dead Free State during the initial chaos of the Mittelafrikan collapse. However, despite their new suzerains, the populace of Uganda - sons and daughters of the great Bantu civilizations that have stretched across East Africa for millenia, are still wavering under opression, be it from foreign Settlers or Tribal Chiefs.

He is our muse, our protector, our shepherd; unmatched in his importance to the freedom we now enjoy and instrumental to all we now hold dear. The people of Kenya shall forever owe a debt to this hero of heroes, but all reverence must start somewhere. Obama is and forever will be the face of our people, the spirit of our nation.

Obama stands over the people of Kenya, and soon all of Africa, as a demigod; a near-mythical being of untold influence and control over the souls that serves as the living embodiment of the Great Ghost Goat - the Mau Mau’s chief spiritual deity taken from the dark fringes of Kikuyu tribal myth - and as the embodiment of Mount Kenya itself and the powerful force of nature that lies inside its rocky core. An avatar of not only the Ghost Goat, but of Africa’s accumulated anti-imperialist rage and their desire for change under the brilliance of Mau-Mauist Totalism, the Mzee Onyango Obama shines as a radiant red light that shall banish the darkness from this Dark Continent once and for all, saving the Pan-Afrikan people from the evils of White colonialism at long last while guiding the way towards spiritual and socialist utopia."

Now largely split between two groups - one that supports the open Socialist nature of Obama and Kimathi, and another that supports the populist ethno-nationalism of Mathenge. To alleviate this split, we must work to spread ideas of unionism and our Africanized concept of pseudo-Syndicalism to these clanmembers, for we shall all at least agree on our economic direction - that is the creation of a Socialist system made to benefit we Mau Mau and the rest of our native Kenyan allies first and foremost, though Mathenge would prefer to keep these socialisms only for the Kikuyu - if we cannot agree on anything else."

A land so pure and diverse in its life, with jungles deep and mystifying and mountaintops that stab into the sky, desperate to touch the gods above. This wondrous land is the birthright of all men and women on this green Earth, and yet this very moment a perverse and twisted force rapes and pillages these lands for profit, greed, and selfish personal gain: the Europeans.

They are downtrodden and abused, oppressed under harsh conditions, forced to toil and slave away just to have it be stolen away in the markets of the White Man. No. No longer, Obama thought to himself as he broke from his trance, staring at the blood-red sunrise as his thoughts took flight. He knew what he had to do. He and his Mau-Mau guerillas would free Kenya and cleanse this filth from these primordial lands.

Obama quickly got off the horse and onto his own and rode in front of his men. “Comrades!

Soon a whole platoon had gathered, he knew this was going to happen. He didn’t want to believe it. Shame he had to disappoint Dedan, his most loyal follower, but hopefully he’ll take charge of the moment as he made him promise to do. It was time Obama was ready to meet his final doom. Before he would meet his end he was determined to bring down as many as he could drawing his C-96 he fired off multiple shots he knew he hit, but he didn’t know how many had died. A SMLE took him into his next life martyred by the oppressors of Africa for freedom for all of Africa.\nThe two ran somehow managing to escape that massacre. Before long Obama had to stop running to catch his breath that took some cover before Dedan spoke to him, revealing his doubt at our current plan and path as the world burned around them.

Despite surprisingly overwhelming our lines when they’ve gotten to our back line we’d set up several maxims and had them mowed down.

obama.12.t:0 "Mau Mau: The Jackals of the Kenya"
obama.12.d:0 "A new book from the famous American ‘Leftish’ author F. Scott Fitzgerald hit shelves today, and one unlike anything he has written before. Fitzgerald had published the new piece after returning from a vacation across East Africa that he embarked on back in 1935. This riveting piece of adventurous literature talks about a small, yet vicious ‘Bush War’ that has been raging between the German-Anglo dual government in the Free State of Kenya and the revolutionary tribal occultists called the Mau-Mau for over a decade. The short but vivid novel goes on about the Mau-Mau’s strange tactics, ideals, and beliefs such as their usage of wooden guns due to their taboo against metals, their belief in water rituals that can supposedly block bullets and heal most wounds, their use of animal sacrifice and blood ceremonies, and even the more dubious, likely false and exaggerated, claims that they partake in ritualistic cannibalism and murder as well in service of their spirit masters, while also explaining the central pillars of their mysterious ideology that is centered around their leader, the Mzee Onyango Obama, who is seen as the avatar of their tribal god the Ghost Goat, even diving into Obama’s personal involvement in the rebellion as one of the leading Marshals of their revolt, though certain critics state these claims of his direct involvement are debatable at best. Overall, this book has sold well among colonial enthusiasts, African history buffs, and Black revolutionary groups the world over, but has remained on shelves collecting dust in many more conservative places like Berlin and Ottawa that see it as an anti-imperialist hit piece, while other groups decry its inaccuracies that do more damage to the Mau Mau movement and wider African revolutionary activity than good. Regardless, the book has at least done its best to shine some light on this forgotten corner of the world, preserving their legacy as the last of the Mau Mau begin to fall...for now."

All of the mother continent and all of her varied peoples and groups of true Afrikan blood shall be united in a system that perfectly fuses National Syndicalism and African Tribalism with ideas of Kikuyu occultism, anti-White ethnocentrism, and total adherence to the cult around the Ghost Goat and her living Marshals. Revolutionary violence shall wash the Dark Continent in a sea of red before our enlightened Marshals illuminate this God-forsaken land once and for all as we prove to the world that we Afrikans united together are the only people worthy enough to claim the riches of Afrika while peacefully living together in Socialist harmony. Going on in great length for hours, diving into the nitty gritty of our new ideology and the coming struggles ahead of us, the growing crowd looked on, fully captivated by their living god, and prepared and eager for the new future ahead of all of us."

These lands were worked by our fathers and our father’s fathers, long before the White Man first stepped foot on our Dark Continent. We know the nooks and crannies of this earth better than all and have used this knowledge to help keep our popular movement alive, waging a brutal guerilla war against these perfidious Europeans and their unending greed. We lie in our rocky fortresses and desert dens trapped like a cornered fox in its lair, ready to lash out and strike at any who would dare try to divorce us from our lands. \nOur brave leader, the grand Mzee Onyango Obama, guides our infantile insurrection the best he can, shepherding our flock as we constantly take flight from the ever pursuing Kenyan Frontier Forces. His near-divine leadership has even inspired many to take worship of this messiah to the Kenya worker, and savior to the people of Africa as a whole. As he leads the Mau-Mau, our most fanatical and zealous brothers-in-arms erect statues in his likeness and create songs and hymns of his triumphs and deeds, slowly creating a personality cult around the young revolutionary, a development he does not seem to condemn. They know that only under Obama’s guidance will they ever have a chance at victory in this seemingly endless war. Our glorious supreme leader is the red sun that shall dawn over a new day in Kenya, serving as the great north star of this noble expedition.

With Mittelafrika's inevitable collapse and the rising of Obama from the dead, the people of Kenya can finally breathe free, knowing that the forces of the Mau-Mau have finally emerged victories after nearly two decades of war, and saved them from the imperialist dogs of the Anglo and Hunnic empires. However, with that victory comes the beginnings of division among the ranks of the Mau-Mau.\n\nDuring the nearly three year long period of Obama's absence, Dedan Kimathi did his best to keep the Mau-Mau united, until such time has Barack come of age, when he could follow in his father's footsteps to become the salvation of Kenya. However Kimathi was no Obama, lacking his former mentor's charisma and natural leadership. While a good leader in his own right, Kimathi was never able to fit into the enormous shoes of Obama. This lack of strong leadership inevitably led to the rise of divisions within the Mau-Mau's ranks, mostly centered around the highly nationalistic and Bantu revivalist Stanley Mathenge. While never outright challenging Dedan's leadership, it was clear that he would be idle once victory was finally won. When Obama suddenly reappeared, once more claiming leadership over the Mau-Mau, Mathenge quickly fell in line, although still clearly harboring his own ideas for the future of Kenya. With victory over Imperialist forces finally won and the Mau-Mau at peace for the first time since its creation, Mathenge has made his move, using several loyalist units to try and capture the capital and with it, Obama, the man in his way to power.\n\n As fighting around [KIK.Capital.GetName] heats up, Mathenge has been able to breach Obama's compound. Just as Mathenge is able to breach Obama's office, a flash of gunfire hails into and out from the room.

On this mountain, years ago, Obama, Kimathi, Mathenge, and many others first congregated, swearing loyalty to one another as they both birthed the KLFA and sparked the fire of the Mau-Mau Revolution to life. \n\nNow, Mzee Obama sat alone at its peak, meditating on his people’s victory and the coming trials ahead, or so he thought... \n\nFor all his victories and triumphs, Obama still held one great failure in his heart: the loss of his student’s respect, for of his two proteges, one had grown long tired of Obama’s empty platitudes and haughty proselytizing. Stanley Mathenge, once heir apparent to the Mau-Mau in Obama’s absence, had long fallen second to Dedan Kimathi, current second-in-command and near-son of the Grand Mzee, over Mathenge’s own prediction for more traditionalist and nationalist views on most of the issues the KLFA has faced. With these disagreements having formed a schism between these titans of Kenyan political affairs, Mathenge’s bitterness and resentment over his former master has long festered and grown, and now he stalks his aging mentor like a jaguar hunting its prey. \n\nAs Obama sits in meditation, listening to his inner thoughts as the howling winds of this stormy peak clear his mind, and conceal his would-be assassin’s tracks, Mathenge has slowly crept up the mountaintop and now stands just meters from the Grand Mzee’s tranquil form. As the young firebrand began to step forward, however, a twig snapped under his footfall, a blunder forced on by his over-eager readiness to strike, alerted the prophet, who immediately leaped to his feet, drawing his knife and readying his counter to Mathenge’s rush. Within moments, the two titans were at each other's throats, exchanging slashes and jabs in a fierce display of force as they battled for the spirit and future of Kenya itself. \n\nAs the fight dragged on and the howling winds turned into a torrential storm, these two demigods of Kenyan idealism were close to exhaustion as their battle drew nearer to its end. In one final effort, both warriors charge each other, with the winner proving to be whomever could draw their blade the quickest. \n\nIn a flash that struck with the rolling thunder and lighting of this alpine storm, blood was drawn and a body fell.

Though this route is not our only access to friendly nations and markets, due to our naval access to the Bharatiya Commune through our ports on the Indian Ocean, it is the most lucrative and most important as open access to the Internationale may prove useful. Until we are in a position to either retake the Ugandan railways or hash out a deal with the Germans over canal usage rights, we must instead build new rail lines to the far North of our nation, bypassing Uganda and instead laying track directly into Sudan’s southern reaches to reach their rail center in Wau.

In their hands, the land was nurtured and cared for, while in the hands of the maniacal Europeans, Kenya has instead been led to ruin.

Under the orders of Mzee Mathenge, the KLFA shall march into the villages and towns of these pastoralists and hunter-gatherers, rounding up the compliant and useful into groups to be sent off to labor camps while any troublemakers or would-be heroes and headaches shall be dealt with in a far more direct and efficient manner.

While he clearly helped cultivate this cult of personality, he has always tried to keep it to a minimum that merely supported his Socialist message without eclipsing it. In speeches, he would indeed mention how he alone carried the spirit of the Ghost Goat within him and how that could help him transform Kenya into a paradise, and with it all of Africa, but he would lead first with his ideological message of Pan-African National Syndicalism fused peacefully and respectfully with tribal structures and traditions. \n\nHowever, that has all changed today, following an official proclamation pronounced from Obama's headquarters atop Mt. Kenya. Mount Kenya has always been viewed by the people of Kenya as the very embodiment of the land, even sometimes as a god itself. It was said that the old Kikuyu creator gods themselves could often be found atop its majestic peaks, waiting to commune with man and nature alike. Taking advantage of this while seeking to gain support from the wider Kenyan masses not within his cult already, Obama declared himself the very Spirit of the Mountain incarnate in addition to his role as the Avatar of the Ghost Goat and High Field Marshal of the Mau Mau. In doing so, he has declared himself nothing short of a literal god, or at least a demigod. He also outlined how, once his mortal life was over, the Spirit of the Mountain and the Spirit of the Ghost Goat would be transferred to his son, Barack. Once Barack had died, his son would inherit the Spirit, ad infinitum until there was no longer a descendent of Obama’s line. With this pseudo-monarchist arrangement set up, many within Kenya have had the opposite reaction Obama hoped for as many turn away from the Mau Mau in renewed disgust over the apparent ego of this claim, but that has not stopped the Mau Mau themselves form embracing this as the clear next step for the movement, and soon all of Afrika shall be forced to accept this reality one way or another."

While of course this comes with the nature of a guerilla fighting force, one piece of news that would eventually make it to the ears of the Mau-Mau was the creation and signing of the Totalist Charter. Obama had always been fascinated with the various proto-Totalist ideologies that floated around the world since he first encountered them during his short period of exile in Egypt. When he learned that these White Men, the very embodiment of evil and all that is wrong with the world, had formalized what he had been leading and teaching the Mau-Mau, he made a mental note that once the revolution was over, and the Mau-Mau stood victorious, he would do all he could to reach out to others who preached a similar Totalism and call them to our capital and correct a great mistake. With Kenya finally pacified and the KLFA preparing to march on the rest of Mittelafrika, the time has finally come to enact what could amount to a second meeting like that which produced the Totalist Charter.\n\nWhile very few actually heeded Obama's call to meet, quite a few were indeed able to make it to the capital. Among the more interesting visitors to the capital is none other than Chief New Moon, an esoteric Totalist who wishes to bathe the New World red in the blood of the White Man to create a true paradise for the Red Man, his name for the indigenous people of the Americas. At first meeting, Obama and New Moon hardly got on, but as time went on, the two have become inseparable. However, the most important visitor to Kenya has been one Oswald Mosley, the very face of Charter Totalism. Despite his obvious whiteness, Mosley and Obama quickly kicked off, becoming quite close friends.\n\nThe meeting in the capital was a surprisingly quick affair, with all present declaring their loyalty to the truest and purest form of Leftism. Just as the meeting was wrapping up, Mosley produced a document. That document was none other than the original Totalist Charter, which he invited every man present to sign. The first to do so was Obama, followed by New Moon. While this is a very small gesture, it has done much to legitimize so-called Esoteric Totalism as a real and official offshoot of Charter Totalism as a whole. With the meeting concluded, all have parted ways, with new friends made by all present."

The young Barack has reportedly taken quite well to his father's lessons, so much so that Obama has granted his young son a small amount of political power, as head of the Electrical and Water Treatment Bureau, a position he is quickly growing into.

While our blessed homeland is not without its share of industries, they are small, and nearly all in the hands of the White Devils. In order to solve this, and to bring Africa into the modern age, Obama has ordered the creation of several 'Industrial Model Cities'. Based heavily on other such Industrial Cities in America and Europe, these new cities, shall finally bring the Industry and jobs that have so long been absent on the Dark Continent. While the cities are a long way off, as construction has only just begun, we have already begun to see a massive boost in our civilian economy, despite reported 'human rights abuses' and 'forced labor squads'. In no time at all, we shall finally be industrially free from the White Devil!"

redkenya.19.t:0 "A Traitor Meets A Fitting End"
redkenya.19.d:0 "As the blood-curdling screams and explosive sounds of gunfire crept closer Kenyatta’s compound, the shaking traitor to the Mau-Mau’s righteous cause trembled behind a wall of Askari troops, fearing the worst as the sickening, wet thumps of panga knives hacking flesh grew ever louder from outside his final hiding place. With each passing minute, Jomo only grew more anxious, wide-eyed, and feral in his fear as the terror squads of the Mau-Mau and their path of utter destruction reached him; their pure, unyielding hatred for the man that betrayed The Great Leader and everything the Mau-Mau and the Kenyan people hold dear when he bent the knee to the foreign colonizers.  \n\nIt was decades ago, after the fires of the Weltkrieg, when Kenyatta departed from the Young Kikuyus and the predecessor organizations that birthed our rebellion. Though he claimed it was to find a peaceful way for our people and all African people to be free, we know better. Kenyatta is a liar and a scoundrel that abandoned our infantile movement to save his own skin as he languished under the imperialist yoke beside us. Well, this day, he shall receive his well-earned justice! \n\nWith the sounds of the maelstrom that unfolded outside his final bastion subsiding, Jomo breathed a sigh of relief, believing, if even just for a second, his troops were victorious. Then all hope faded in a flash of white phosphorus and hellfire. After seconds that felt like millenia, Kenyatta opened his eyes after a cacophony of noise, light, and vitriolic chemicals drowned out his senses and blocked the world from his perception, shocked only to see the bloodied, mutilated corpses of his loyal askari guard strewn about the shack he had decided to make this ‘valiant’ last stand. \n\nThen, in a flash, it was over. Without a final, grandiose speech or apology, without even a final word, the leading Mau Mau guerilla stepped forward before Kenyatta even could clearly make sense of his newly demolished surroundings and decapitated the traitorous snake in one quick action - a far too quick death for this scum. Jomo Kenyatta’s last words were but a mere whimper mixed with the smell of him relieving himself in panic and sound of cold steel meeting the flesh of a vile pig."

Mzee Onyango Obama has led the African people to liberty, throwing off the yoke of their long-standing oppressors and seizing back the honor and respect stolen and tarnished by the Europeans. The Great Leader has made good on his promise, and all of Afrika must now thank him for it, for without this God amongst men, there would be no new Afrika. Only Obama, only Totalism, has led the Afrikan people to independence, and now only Obama shall lead them into their future; now and forever!"

redkenya.21.d:0 "With our victory atop Kirinyaga and our rule secured across the lands of the Bantu-Kenyans, Stanley Mathenge led the reforged armed forces of the Mau-Mau into a heroic last stand against the vile imperialist forces that had beset the homelands of the Great Bantu. Like our ancestors, who poured out from the center of our progenation in Central Africa and spread across the Sub-Saharan expanse during the Bantu Expansion, Mathenge has championed this Second Bantu Expansion, rescuing the chosen people of Afrika’s first sons from the clutches of imperialist taint. Now, after countless lives have been lost and with untold amounts of blood spilled on this pristine and ancient Eden that is Afrika, Mathenge and the Mau Mau stand triumphant. Under his rule, the Heirs to the Bantu have been saved - may all lesser peoples bask in their purity and tremble in their wake!"

redkenya.22.d:0 "’’Comrade Dedan,’’ A sharp, stiffened voice perked up from behind the messy piles of books and papers that laid across the school desk. ‘’Was my father a good man?’’ Kimathi turned his attention to the young Barack Obama; the son of his late mentor to whom he was now the guardian of. When he was not attending meetings with delegates of the Internationale or traveling around the country, Kimathi would spend his time at home, observing and making aware of Barack’s advances in education. ‘’Why do you ask such a question, comrade Barack?’’ Dedan’s shifted from his seat, trying to catch a glimpse of the child. “Come here boy, let me see you while you speak.”\n\nThe child would stand from his chair, presenting himself before his guardian. Kimathi felt a slight chill up his arms – Barack was a spitting image of his old man. ‘’When I want to play with the other children, they no longer want to play. When I look outside, I see no one else has men with guns besides them like I do. I asked my teacher why this was, and he said that it was because I am the son of a hero. But I do not know why he is a hero.’’\n\nKimathi smiled lightly, standing up and pointing at the nearest window. ‘’What do you see out there?’’ Hesitantly, Barack stepped over and peered over the window. Almost as far as he could see, the city was sprawling with activity; people were commuting to work, mothers stood around chattering as their children played on the roads, the distant noise of homes being constructed was ever-present. ‘’I just see the city, comrade Dedan.’’ Kimathi shook his head. ‘’You see peace, happiness, prosperity. A bright future for you, and all of Kenya. None of what you see would be possible without your father."

redkenya.23.d:0 "As part of Kimathi’s new initiative to propel Kenya into a new era, he has reached a controversial decision - the Kenyan State will officially establish diplomatic ties with the Communal government in Paris. This decision has come with some backlash amongst the Hardliners of the KLFA, who have deemed this decision as a betrayal of Obama’s vision of a Kenya truly free of the Europeans, socialist or not. Kimathi has rebutted these accusations of disgracing Obama fiercely, and that Kenya has nothing to lose from collaborating with the Commune and her allies, especially as they fight the same struggle against the imperialists as we once had.\nWith the majority of the opposition quelled by Kimathi’s reasoning, or by ‘gentle persuasion’, talks have already gone ahead with the Third Internationale, and we are soon to expect our first diplomatic mission from the French government to officiate Kenya’s entry into the faction."

redkenya.24.d:0 "After years of studying under Dedan Kimathi’s shadow, Barack Obama has finally come of the age where he is now expected to take the mantle of leader of Kenya, as deemed by his master and his late father, Onyango Obama who is now an idolized legend in Kenyan society. Many have anticipated this moment, including Barack himself, however there is one glaring issue - the young man does not look anywhere close to his actual age, and this has concerned Kimathi greatly, who believes that his aged appearance may be the result of stress and thus he might not be able to meet the challenges he will face as leader of the nation and the people. In the end, it is Dedan’s decision whether the Obama family legacy continues now, or perhaps the heir is not yet ready for the task of being a leader yet."

redkenya.25.d:0 "Despite his open rivalry with Obama that was obvious to all before his rise to power, Stanley Mathenge and his inner circle of former King’s African Rifles that now dominate the upper echelons of our movement have been rather candid about their rise to the top and the methods used to get there, almost as if they want the masses to know their violent tendencies and utter ruthlessness on purpose in order to keep all in line. With foreign reporters and interviewers coming to witness the first triumphant anti-colonial revolution in Afrika, many had expected to find the Mzee at the top of the pile in all his false glory, but when they arrived all they were greeted by has been the splendor of Mathenge and our renewed interest in Bantu exceptionalism and ethno-linguistic nationalism built on the backs of Mau Mau rebellion and Kikuyu tribal occultism, violent interparty rivalries, and ethnic conflict like between the Bantu and their hated Masai counterparts that leech off our Kinyaa. Though few would admit it aloud without his permission, all Kenyans know the truth - Mathenge killed Obama with his own hands in order to take over the duties of Mzee, Avatar of the Ghost Goat, and Pan-Bantu champion of the Mau Mau movement, and now with Mathenge at the top of the pile without contest, the rest of the nation must accept this truth lest they be left behind in a shallow grave, forgotten by the inevitable march of the Pan-African dream."

redkenya.26.d:0 "Though our revolution was successful, with all of Kenya and Africa under our glorious rule, many have called for Barack Obama Sr. to finally step down in favor of his radical son of the same name. Barack Sr.'s rule has been one of stagnation for the People's state with many questioning his almost mythical status. The Young Obama has also critiqued this as well, claiming his father is unfit to rule the country as of current and that he alone can bring back Hope to the Mau-Mau as his grandfather did all those years ago. Recently, posters have begun being spread throughout the capital of our state with words like "Hope" and "Yes We Can!" plastered over the young Obama's face. The situation has now reached a boiling point with both side's supporters actively fighting in the streets, threatening to collapse the state their grandfather fought to create all those years ago."

redkenya.27.t:0 "A Reclamation of the Colonial Past"
redkenya.27.d:0 "During the times of the initial uprising all that time ago in 1925, the Great Obama became something of a scapegoat for all the problems of the colonial regime. Everything from poor working conditions, a stagnating economy, unfilled election promises and even food and water shortages were blamed on either the Mau-Mau or the war against us. Being the outspoken leader of our band of freedom fighters, the Mzee took nearly all the blame. Eventually, the colonials as well as native Kenyans became accustomed to this finger-pointing and began to jokingly blame nearly everything on Obama, using the phrase 'Thanks Obama' when anything went wrong. Eventually 'Thanks Obama' began to even be used by the perfidious White regime, as even members of the government saw the extent to which Obama was blamed.\n\n With our victory over the White Devil however, the Mountain has seen fit to reclaim this phrase which has become so common to the Kenyan people. With his advancement, Thanks Obama has become something of a slogan for the Mau-Mau's rule over Kenya. Instead of blaming Obama, the slogan has been turned upside down, to show all the good Obama has done for Kenya, and all of Afrika. While it will take some time for the people to fully turn to the phrase's new meaning, in time Obama shall truly be thanked for all he has done."
redkenya.27.a:0 "Thanks, Obama!"

redkenya.28.t:0 "Obama's Government"
redkenya.28.d:0 "With the power struggle against Mathenge now finally dealt with, Mzee Onyango Obama stands atop the Mountain, ready to lead Kenya and all of wider Africa towards its destiny. However, the Mzee has not gotten to this position alone, for all around him are scores of loyal allies and devotees that would follow their Mzee to hell and back to fulfill their dream. Though Mzee Obama could easily continue to rule alone, he is in a position now to formally delegate many of the lesser functions of statecraft to his loyal advisors and aides headed by his right-hand man, the ever loyal Dedan Kimathi, leaving his time more free to perform the tasks and duties fitting of the prophetic Mzee that he is. Of course, Obama has no need for this help, however, for a man of his talents and splendor can easily run this whole nation - nay, this whole continent - by himself as well. What shall the Mzee decide?"

redkenya.29.d:0 "As the First Bantu Empire rises atop the backs of our brave Kikuyu warriors, and as we move further and further away from the original doctrine of Obama’s Mau Mau, many have begun to suggest that a new banner be made for our empire under Mzee Mathenge. We could either stick with the red and black banner using the colors of the Mau Mau that depicts our sacred Mugumo Sycamore Fig tree, or we could begin to use the traditional colors of the Kikuyu (or Gīkūyū) people, being an earthy Ochre color that represents the feminine Mūmbi force of nature and the soil, a deep Blue representing the masculine Gīkūyū force of water and the sky, and White that represents the life force that flows within all from the top of Mount Kenya where Ira Mwene Nyaga, the god of the Kikuyu, resides. Utilizing this traditional Kikuyu-Bantu palette, we could create a design using either the all-important and ever-present ritualistic Ndome shields used during our special warrior rituals and dances before battle, the sacred Mugumo Sycamore tree whose roots trace the stories of our ancestors and whose fruits nourish our future generations, or the traditional trinity symbol of the Kikuyu people representing the masculine, feminine, and life forces all interacting as one complete whole.

Our local communes have flourished in the guidance of the KLFA and cooperation in the highlands has proved to be fully assured. With successful socialist progression, some may believe it is now the appropriate time to fully realize the tempered Pan-African strain of Kimathi's genius, and establish a union that stretches from Sudan to Madagascar under a united banner. Although Kimathi has been toying with such an ambitious notion, it's proven to be wise to postpone or even abandon the ideals of an African superstate, as some may fear that our ever-so improving system will be threatened, and instead focus on our own nation and perfect our proud union."

redkenya.32.t:0 "Fate of the Pastroalist Menace"
redkenya.32.d:0 "With the pastoralist menace of the foreign Maasai tribes and Anglo-Germanic colonials known to all, we must now decide on their final fate. Before us lies three options, each proposed by a different clique of our fracturing Mau Mau movement. While all agree that the imperialists should be largely wiped out or at least removed from our borders, it is the fate of the Maasai that has come under debate. The clique most loyal to the ways of the Mzee Onyango Obama believe that the Maasai should be forcibly integrated into our system, accepting the ways of Mau Mau socialism while abandoning their old ways of pastoralist decay, allowing the Maasai to live peacefully and hopefully equally within our growing Pan-Afrikan dream; if they accept these terms that is, but any who don’t shall face death or exile. The clique following the ways of young upstart Dedan Kimathi along with his allies the fellow Kenyans Fred Kubai and Bildad Kaggia along with Makhan Singh - an import Indian from the former Raj turned devout pro-African socialist, wish to respect the ways of the Maasai while limiting their wider impact, granting them autonomy and an ability to live their pastoralist lives in a newly socialized sense while limiting their settlements and ranches to small, isolated regions in the north, preventing needless death while virtually eliminating the problem all but entirely, though this system has been compared to similar reservation ideas used by the very colonials whose influence we are trying to fight. Finally, the nationalist ‘socialists’ and varied Kikuyu gangers and ethnonationalist military men all aligned under Stanley Mathenge call for a simple but brutish solution that amounts to removing the Maasai from the equation altogether in a violent retribution campaign aimed at chasing out the few Maasai left alive if Mathenge gets his way in the name of Bantu purity. What shall be their final fate?"
redkenya.32.a:0 "They shall embrace our system, no matter what."

redkenya.33.d:0 "Although Dedan Kimathi took over in the wake of Obama’s death at the hands of the traitor Mathenge, doing so was only meant to be a temporary position, with Kimathi promising to step down once Obama’s orphaned infant son - currently under Kimathi’s care - came of age to rule as the next Avatar of the Ghost Goat. However, many more normal-minded socialists within our coalition, along with other Mau Mau members not as faithful to the near-occultist belief of the Ghost Goat, have come to resent such a ludicrous idea, decrying this so-called ludicrous plan as a form of pseudo-monarchism and reactionary tyranny. Instead, this growing clique led by Bildad Kaggia and Fred Kubai of the Mau Mau Central Committee pleaded with Kimathi to abandon this plan in pursuit of a more standard system of succession based around our Socialist influences within a heavily moderated form of our current government - a plea shared by other Mau Mau-affiliated Socialists like the tribal paternalist Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and the father of Kenyan syndicalism Makhan Singh who both uplift the Kenyan concept of Uhuru or freedom, while even threatening to oust Kimathi if he does not comply, though if this is just a bluff or not is unknown at this time.

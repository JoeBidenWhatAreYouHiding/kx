KIK_Mountain_Deferred_desc:0 "For 11 years the ALA has held out in Wajir and on Mt. Kenya. Now though, things seem to have progressed to their final stage. We are surrounded, outnumbered and outgunned."
KIK_Revisionist_Pariah:0 "Revisionist Pariah"
KIK_Revisionist_Pariah_desc:0 "'Syndicalism' and its perfidious creed in London and Paris is just another form of white man's imperialism. Only Obama, only Totalism; only we can be the salvation of Kenya."
KIK_Maumau:0 "Mau Mau Bush War"
KIK_Maumau_desc:0 "Nairobi / Kampala continues to make war with us. We fear there is little time left before every brave fighter of our cause has been slaughtered by the white devils."
KIK_onlyobama:0 "Only Obama"
KIK_onlyobama_desc:0 "It is now clear to all within our beloved Kenya, and soon it will be clear to all of Africa. Obama, beloveded leader of the Mau-Mau, is the sole man who can free Africa from the White Man. Only Obama can remove forever the curse of Whiteness that has infected our Holy Homeland."
KIK_onlytotalism:0 "Only Totalism"
KIK_onlytotalism_desc:0 "Totalism, the most powerful and sole accpectable idea of the White Man, is the only way that we can free Africa. While Obama may be the sole man who can free us, it is with the power and unity of Totalism that he is able to do that. Only Totalism, only with it's most blessed unity, can Africa be free of the White Man."

### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_OBAMA_DESC:0 "For 11 years the Mau-Mau have resisted for forces of Kenya-Uganda. At the head of the resistance is a man by the name of Hussein Onyango Obama, the sole salvation of Kenya against imperialist forces. Even though times may seem bleak, the African Liberation Army holds strong, and will do so until the bitter end. Until the end comes, Obama will lead the Mau-Mau against all forces of imperialism, whether they be the Germans or the perfidious Syndicalists based in London or Paris. Obama’s Socialism is not one crafted in the halls of European Elites, but in the heart of Africa. To the enemies of Obama, to the enemies of the People of Africa; no mercy will be shown, no concessions given, and no surrender accepted."

POLITICS_PUNISHED_OBAMA_DESC:0 "After the disastrous climax of the Mau-Mau’s initial revolution, our forces were scattered and slaughtered, mercilessly gunned down by the frontier forces of Kenya-Uganda. Hussein Onyago Obama himself was thought to be dead, with his closest associates fleeing into hiding under the command of his right hand man Dedan Kimathi, who has also made sure to save Obama’s only son. What no one knew, however, was that Obama had miraculously survived the battle! Crawling dozens of miles to the nearest safe village while clutching his bleeding gunshot and sabre wounds, he limped painfully to safety. Once in the care of local sympathizers, he would plot his revenge as the tribal healers tended to his wounds that would horrifically scar his body for life. Awaiting the perfect day to reveal his survival to his people, the collapse of the bloated Mittelafrikan monstrosity has provided the perfect stage for his return. Once again, Obama marches towards his destiny, seemingly back from the dead, infuriated and more determined than ever before. For the people of Africa, for Totalism, only Obama can be their true salvation."

KIK_call_to_arms_desc:0 "As we prepare for the final battle, we are going to need more men. To this end, Obama has green lit a great propaganda campaign across Kenya.

It is also no secret that we are quickly running out of bullets. In order to solve this, Obama has agreed to an offer from a mercenary company based out of the Congo. They will provide us with modern equipment. In exchange, we are to take out a few “problem” colonial administrators for them.

KIK_fortify_the_mountain_desc:0 "Mt. Kenya, the great symbol of both our revolt and people, is a very powerful and moving image to the minds of the Mau-Mau. For us, it shows that while oppression may come, it can never fully destroy a people. The Mountain has been here from the beginning, and will be, until the end. The Mountain is also symbolic of the Great Mountain of the Mau-Mau, Obama. Obama stands above us all, guiding us, as a lighthouse guides ships at sea. Just as ship at sea when the lighthouse goes out crashes against the rocks of the shore, so too will the Mau-Mau crash without the guidance of Obama. This coming battle will be a great test for the Mountain of the Mau-Mau, but with the love of the people and the unity of Totalism, there is no way the Mountain will not be able to stand firm in the coming storm."

KIK_only_totalism:0 "Only Totalism..."
KIK_only_totalism_desc:0 "Totalism: an ideology born not in the halls of some European College, but in the hearts of men who saw the corruption and vanity of Syndicalism and Radical Socialism. Totalism is the only acceptable idea of the White Devil. Without the beauty and purity of Totalism, Obama would not have been able to guide the Mau-Mau with as much success as he has. Even before Totalism was formalized in that blessed Charter, Obama has been following it in his heart, as Totalism is not something that was invented. No, Totalism is inscribed on the hearts of every true African by God, and every true Mau-Mau warrior knows this. Thus it is only with Totalism, the greatest and highest of Mankind's ideals, that Africa can be freed."

As he moved along the patrol a Horseman came riding up to him. “Do you know where your boss is, Mate?” He said to the Mau-Mau in an accent, Ngure following his instinct immediately pointed his rifle at him. The white man covered in a shemagh simply and calmly replied back, “Do you know where your boss is?” Before long the platoon commander of Ngure unit came up, “So do you have it?” “Right I do, the convoy is coming up soon, here’s your next target.” He said, throwing a packet to the platoon leader. After the horsemen rode off the platoon followed down the trail to where a stopped convoy was. Soon white men came out and began loading into the last truck. “Good luck with your little rebellion, Mate! You’ll need it!” The man said waving his hand as they drove away. At this moment Ngure questioned his Platoon leader, “Why are taking arms from the white devils?” and then the leader replied back with venom, “Who are you to question what our leader Obama mandated! Guns for the Mau-Mau must be acquired by any means! If they want to sell their rope to us, by telling us which white man must die then so be it!” The leader said before hitting him on the head like a dog."

As the first light of morning began to bathe the sky in its red hue, Obama too rose to the summit of Mt. Kenya. Staring out at the horizon, he beholds the vast expanse of the land around him, this cradle of humankind and birthplace of our species. A land so pure and diverse in its life, with jungles deep and mystifying and mountaintops that stab into the sky, desperate to touch the gods above. This wondrous land is the birthright of all men and women on this green Earth, and yet this very moment a perverse and twisted force rapes and pillages these lands for profit, greed, and selfish personal gain: the Europeans. These pasty-faced demons lie and deceive with their promises of civilization and progress and yet the land weeps under their every move and the people of Kenya suffer for it. They are downtrodden and abused, oppressed under harsh conditions, forced to toil and slave away just to have it be stolen away in the markets of the White Man. No. No longer, Obama thought to himself as he broke from his trance, staring at the blood-red sunrise as his thoughts took flight. He knew what he had to do. He and his Mau-Mau guerillas would free Kenya and cleanse this filth from these primordial lands. With the light of Totalism guiding them as the light of the dawn had guided his journey up the mountain, Obama knew he would not falter in this fight. The Mountain’s final test was upon him, and he knew he would succeed, for Kenya, for Totalism!"

His ally in the revolution and one of it’s youngest soldiers, Dedan Kimathi, came up to Leader Obama. “There’s enough…” Obama replied back, “Enough for what we’re planning Comrade!” Kimathi reached out his hand to Obama and grabbed it pulling him up on his horse and ran towards his troops. Obama quickly got off the horse and onto his own and rode in front of his men. “Comrades! These seem to be our final days!” The men chant ‘The Mau-Maus will never end!’ for several times before Obama got them to quit it, “Over these past years I have learned that change can only come from the bottom-up for the oppressed peoples of Africa! We Mau-Maus have built a model community that served to make the people’s lives better!” The men were ecstatic, readied, and willing to die for Obama. Obama quietly orders them into the formation Fitzgerald had taught them in the days before this battle. With a single word- interrupted by the only White Man trusted by Obama and Kimathi,F Scott Fitzgerald. “So you’ve decided to stick with us! The Germans will have you hanged and quartered like the rest of us!” Shouted Obama to the journalist that had once been their prisoner. “These past few months I have been your brother! Let me ride with my brothers one more time!” Fitzgerald said to Obama and his men. “Then ride with us! Join us in battle...one more time.” Obama smiled now with Fitzgerald at their side they could probably keep the formation together before contact with the Germans. Now with a single word the posse rode towards their lines together as a brave band of Revolutionary Warriors destined to free Africa."

The Mau-Mau simply wouldn’t leave their home without a fight. The fighting was some of the bloodiest Africa had seen breaking the Mau-Maus back sending them fleeing to Mau Forest and the Mountains of Kenya. This wouldn’t be the end for them, too many have escaped to fight the Germans another day.\nObama badly wounded from the charge managed to find himself at the horse ranch where they had prepared that attack. He hid inside it’s barn trying to lay low until he could escape back to men. Sadly enough the Germans weren’t as stupid as he thought. Soon a whole platoon had gathered, he knew this was going to happen. He didn’t want to believe it. Shame he had to disappoint Dedan, his most loyal follower, but hopefully he’ll take charge of the moment as he made him promise to do. It was time Obama was ready to meet his final doom. Before he would meet his end he was determined to bring down as many as he could drawing his C-96 he fired off multiple shots he knew he hit, but he didn’t know how many had died. A SMLE took him into his next life martyred by the oppressors of Africa for freedom for all of Africa.\nThe two ran somehow managing to escape that massacre. Before long Obama had to stop running to catch his breath that took some cover before long Dedan spoke to him, “So is this how we plan to end? Dying in some forgotten town.” Dedan angrily said at him Obama quickly replied back. “Everything's coming together...exactly as I’ve planned.” Dedan merely was confused, “How the hell is coming together! We’re in a bigger mess than before!” “Don’t worry, for now we need to split up, they're still following us!” Obama interrupted Dedan’s questioning."

Young Dedan Kimathi, the right hand of Obama, has stepped up to lead our movement in its darkest hour. Kimathi claims to carry on Obama’s will, and has taken his infant son Barack along with what remains of our forces to lick our wounds. Though he assured us we will avenge our fallen Leader and brothers, even the most proud warriors of the Mau-Mau can’t help but ask themselves, “Is this the end?”"

obama.11.d:0 "Our assessment was indeed correct and the forces remaining at Wajir were indeed too few in number to resist us. Their tenacity, fanaticism, and capabilities of finding something new to annoy us with has remained the same. At 14:00 yesterday (at the time of this report) the Mau-Maus used horses taken from an English Settler Ranch, (said Settler had been dead since the start of the uprising), and conducted a final charge upon us. Despite surprisingly overwhelming our lines when they’ve gotten to our back line we’d set up several maxims and had them mowed down. There were also reports of a white man among them, but no one among the defense forces was able to confirm this. It was possible he was able to escape after the carnage that was the cavalry charge. Obama was confirmed to have escaped his failed attempt at victory. Found in a barn he attempted to shoot his way out is belived to have been shot dead, not before killing 5 and wounding 2. We have so-far been unable to find Obama's body, despite the men who went to after him confiriming his death. Hopefully with his death we’ll be able to deal with the remains of what's left of this annoying rebellion. We’re also now cleaning up what remains and burning anything written by them that isn’t relevant to our information gathering. There are many lessons to be learned from this event and firstly..."

obama.12.d:0 "A recent book from the famous American author F. Scott Fitzgerald hit shelves today. Fitzgerald had published the new piece after returning from a vacation in Westafrika that he embarked on in 1935. This middling piece of literature talks about a small, yet viscous “Bush War” between the German Government of Kenya and the Mau-Mau. It goes on about Mau-Mau’s tactics and ideals, their leader Hussein Obama, and Obama’s personal involvement in the rebellion, which critics state are quite dubious. Overall this book isn’t a big seller and just adds to the bad reputation Obama seems to have earned in the colonies."

They know they didn’t — look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something — there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.\n\n If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable Kenyan system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The telegraph didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the telegraph so that all the companies could make money off the telegraph.\n\n The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires. \n\n So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we'll free Kenya. That’s how we'll defeat the Hun! That’s how we'll a build a Totalist Nation! That’s how we'll free all of Africa!

obama.14.d:0 "“We meet at a moment of great uncertainty for Kenya. The economic crisis we face is the worst in our modern history. Markets across the globe have become increasingly unstable, and millions of Kenyans will open up their wallets this week and see that so much of their hard-earned cash has disappeared.	760,000 workers have lost their jobs this week alone. Unemployment here in Kenya 85% over the last eight years, which is the highest it's been in sixteen years. You've lost one of every four manufacturing jobs, the typical Kenyan family has seen their income fall $25, and it's getting harder and harder to make the rent, or fill up your stomach, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. At this rate, the question isn't just are you better off than you were four years ago?, it's are you better off than you were four weeks ago? \n\n We still have the most talented, most productive workers of any country on Earth. We're still home to innovation and technology, colleges and universities that are the envy of the world. Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities. It won't be easy, but there's no reason we can't make this century the Kenyan century. \n\n But it will take a new direction. It will take new leadership in Nairobi. It will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last years.  \n\n Over the course of the Bush War, I've laid out a set of policies that will grow our middle-class and strengthen our economy in the long-term. I'll reform our tax code so that 95% of workers and their families get a tax cut, and eliminate income taxes for seniors making under $50,000. I'll bring down the cost of healthcare for families and businesses by investing in preventative care, new technology, and giving every Kenyan the chance to get the same kind of health insurance that members of the Colonial Authority  give themselves. We'll ensure every child can compete in the global economy by recruiting an army of new teachers and making college affordable for anyone who wants to go. We'll create five million new, high-wage jobs by investing in the renewable sources of energy that will eliminate the oil we currently import from the Middle East in ten years, and we'll create two million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads, schools and bridges. It's a serious challenge. But we can do it if we act now, and if we act as one nation. We can bring a new era of responsibility and accountability to Kenya and to Nairobi.  \n\n Together, we cannot fail. Not now. Not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save. Not when there are so many Kenyans without jobs and without homes. Not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor, or send their child to college, or pay their bills at the end of the month. Not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves. \n\n Now it falls to us. Together, we cannot fail! Together, we can overcome the broken policies and divided politics of the last eighty years! Together, we can renew an economy that rewards work and rebuilds the middle class! Together, we can create millions of new jobs,  and deliver on the promise of healthcare you can afford and education that helps your kids compete! We can do this if we come together, if we have confidence in ourselves and each other, if we look beyond the darkness of the day to the bright light of hope that lies ahead. Together, we can change this country and change this world. Thank you, and remember, Only Totalism and Only I can lead Kenya to freedom!”"

To this very day, there are some Kenyans who want to stay in the fight longer, and some who want to make peace. But there should be no disagreement on what the men and women of our military have achieved.\n\n And so I want to be very clear: We are fighting to do away with the Hun – and we will do that. We will leave the Kenyan people with a hard-earned opportunity to live a better life – that is your achievement; that is the prospect that you have made possible. \n\n There are many lessons to be learned from what we’ve experienced. We have learned that the Mau-Mau must go to war with clearly defined goals.. We have learned that we must always weigh the costs of action, and communicate those costs candidly to the Kenyan people. We have learned that in the 20th century, we must use all elements of Kenyan power to achieve our objectives, which is why I am committed to building our civilian national security capacity so that the burden is not continually pushed on to our military. We have learned that our political leaders must pursue the broad and bipartisan support that our national security policies depend upon, which is why I will consult with no other man when carrying out my plans. And we have learned the importance of working closely with friends and allies, which is why we are launching a new era of engagement in the Bush War. \n\n The starting point for our policies must alway the freedom of the Kenyan people. I know that you – the men and women of the finest fighting force in the history of the world – can meet any challenge, and defeat any foe. And as your Commander-in-Chief, I promise you that I will only send you into harm’s way when it is absolutely necessary, and provide you with the equipment and support you need to get the job done. That is the most important lesson of all – for the consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices immeasurable. \n\n You know because you have seen those sacrifices. You have lived them. And we all honor them. \n\n Each Kenyan who has served with the Mau-Mau has their own story. Each of you has your own story. And that story is now a part of the history of the Kenyan people– a people that exists only because free men and women have bled for it from the beaches to the deserts. From the mountains to the street. You teach us that the price of freedom is great. Your sacrifice should challenge all of us – every single Kenyan – to ask what we can do to be better citizens. \n\n There will be more danger in the months ahead. We will face new tests and unforeseen trials. But thanks to the sacrifices of those who have served, we have forged hard-earned progress, we WILL drive the Hun from this land and we shall have peace! \n\n Thank you, and may the Light of Totalism lead us to victory!”"

obama.17.t:0 "Obama's Kenya"
obama.17.d:0 "We have marched long and hard through the treacherous highlands and scorching deserts of Kenya as we spread the blazing inferno of rebellion across these lands. From the highest peaks of Mt. Kenya to the rolling plains and scrublands of our base of operations in Wajir, the call of Totalism, of Obama, echoes across our birthright. These lands were worked by our fathers and our father’s fathers, long before the White Man first stepped foot on our Dark Continent. We know the nooks and crannies of this earth better than all and have used this knowledge to help keep our popular movement alive, waging a brutal guerilla war against these perfidious Europeans and their unending greed. We lie in our rocky fortresses and desert dens trapped like a cornered fox in its lair, ready to lash out and strike at any who would dare try to divorce us from our lands. \nOur brave leader, the grand Mzee Hussein Onyango Obama, guides our infantile insurrection the best he can, shepherding our flock as we constantly take flight from the ever pursuing Kenyan Frontier Forces. His near-divine leadership has even inspired many to take worship of this messiah to the Kenya worker, and saviour to the people of Africa as a whole. As he leads the Mau-Mau, our most fanatical and zealous brothers-in-arms erect statues in his likeness and create songs and hymns of his triumphs and deeds, slowly creating a personality cult around the young revolutionary, a development he does not seem to condemn. They know that only under Obama’s guidance will they ever have a chance at victory in this seemingly endless war. Our glorious supreme leader is the red sun that shall dawn over a new day in Kenya, serving as the great north star of this noble expedition. Under his radiant red light, Obama will usher in the dawn of a better Kenya, a better Africa; one soaked in both the red glow of Totalism and the dark stains of our enemy’s' blood."

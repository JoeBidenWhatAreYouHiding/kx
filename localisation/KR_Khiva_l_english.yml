### Events ###
khiva.1.t: "The Recent History of Khwarezm"
khiva.1.d: "The Khanate of Khiva has been under Russian protectorate since 1873. Following the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia, the Young Khivans requested reforms from the Khiva khan Isfandiyar-khan. He was compelled to agree and committed to establishing a majlis and restricting his own power. The situation escalated and unfortunately, the Young Khiva government was overthrown, resulting in the planned liberal reforms not being carried out.\n\nIn January 1918, Isfandiyar-khan appointed Junaid-khan as the commander of the armed forces of the khanate. However, after the Russian detachment left Khiva, Junaid-khan made the decision to order the killing of Isfandiyar-khan and his younger brother, Said Abdullah-Khan, was appointed as the monarch. The Mujahideen were well-equipped, the Khiva territories were thriving, and Junaid-Khan maintained a tight grip on his army, sending it to the east and north to battle the Reds. He gained fame for his victories in several difficult battles. After the war ended and the dust settled over Turkestan, negotiating with Junaid-Khan proved to be more challenging for the Russians than with his predecessor. While recognizing Khiva's sovereignty, the Sazonov's government aimed to keep Khiva within its sphere of influence and maintain access to its abundant natural resources. Junaid-Khan expressed his opposition to this and other political reforms in the khanate that were previously supported by the Russian republicans. The brigand Khan made a threat to send his army against the weakened Russians if they exceeded their authority."
khiva.1.a: "Interesting"

khiva.2.t: "Junaid-Khan Is Dead!"
khiva.2.d: "Junaid-Khan, proud Yomud military commander and our “dear” leader for almost 20 years has finally succumbed to the withering of age and has passed away. The Khanate mourns as they prepare for the coming power struggle."
khiva.2.a: "Eshi-Khan, son of Junaid-Khan, ascends the throne"
khiva.2.b: "A Turkmen chief, Azis-Khan, seizes power."
khiva.2.c: "The Turkmen Committee under Hajy Myrat seizes power."

khiva.3.t: "The Rule of Junaid-Khan"
khiva.3.d: "In the 1920s, there were attempts by the Russians to persuade Junaid-Khan to demobilize his army and sign a friendship treaty with Russia. Unfortunately, these negotiations were unsuccessful due to Kolchak's coup. Junaid stated his intention to reclaim the territories that Khiva had lost five decades years ago, marking the end of the previous era of obedience. The Russians were unable to stop him, as his Mujahideen army had annexed the entire Transcaspian region, which had a significant Turkmen population. Russia ultimately agreed to the new terms of cooperation with Khiva, and attempts were made to establish normalized political and commercial relations with the Khanate.\n\nThe following decade presented challenges for Junaid-Khan as he governed a vast country while facing various difficulties. Junaid faced challenges from liberal movements and discontented Uzbeks due to him being a Turkmen chief. He promoted loyal individuals to positions of power, although some may argue that this came at the expense of more capable administrators. Furthermore, he granted certain groups the right to collect taxes and tribute, which some may view as controversial. As a result, Khiva has remained an agrarian, nomadic country, located in the middle of the desert. Despite impressive agricultural practices, the country faced challenges in maintaining unity among its people. In response, Junaid worked to cultivate a sense of Turkmen nationalism, influenced by the ideas of his advisor Hajy Myrat. The hope was to create a common collective identity that would bind the Turkmen tribes together.\n\nAging Junaid-khan is currently preparing his son Eshi-Khan, a capable warrior, to inherit the throne after his imminent death. Despite this, Junaid is determined to first address any remaining organized political opposition and stabilize the country to ensure a smooth transition of power to his son."
khiva.3.a: "Khiva Lives On!"

khiva.4.t: "War in Afghanistan"
khiva.4.d: "Today, Junaid-Khan has received the news that our brave brothers, the mujahideen of Afghanistan, have raised their heads and rifles against the British imperialists. We must support our neighbors in their Jihad and send some of our volunteers with arms to show our solidarity."
khiva.4.a: "We need to help our brothers!"

khiva.5.t: "Agricultural Exports Put On Hold!"
khiva.5.d: "As the economic crisis broke out in Europe and everywhere else in the world, it also affected our most important importers - Russia and Turkestan. As a result of this hell of a modernized world, our largest importers have stopped all purchases, and this before the most important stage of the new sowing. \n\nWithout a resumption of supplies, our economy risks collapse!"
khiva.5.a: "Damn the modern world!"

khiva.6.t: "Turkestan Plunges Into Civil War!"
khiva.6.d: "$turkestan_civil_war.4.d$\n\nHowever, some mouths in the government suggest that with the Turkestan falling into a bloody civil war, we are now free for a new conquest campaign. This time Junaid-Khan was presented with a hope to successfully invade the right bank of Amu-Darya, including the cities of Nukus and Turtkul, long-time desired lands that we temporarily controlled during the Russian Civil War."
khiva.6.a: "Seize the Amu-Darya right bank!"
khiva.6.b: "We don't need more Uzbeks in our state."

khiva.7.t: "[FROM.GetName] Seized Nukus!"
khiva.7.d: "Using our weak position, the horde of Junaid-Khan, a Khivan Dictator, have roamed the right bank of the Amu-Darya and seized major cities of Nukus and Turtkul!"
khiva.7.a: "We can't do anything now!"

khiva.8.t: "Coup in Khiva"
khiva.8.d: "Junaid-Khan himself went on another raid against his neighbors and for the sake of raising prestige and legitimacy, along with his son and closest advisor, Eshi-Khan. \n\nHowever, his opponents took advantage of this, having long ago established a coalition of various forces against the usurper, on the other bank of the Amu-Darya. In the absence of Junaid-Khan and his associates in the capital of Khorezm, the opposition moved to the other side of the Amu-Darya from Turtkul and seized power in the city, announcing the establishment of the Provisional Council of the Khiva Khanate. \n\nThe council included both former cronies of the murdered Isfandiyar Khan and the Young Khivans. The power of this council is not yet strong, but it seems that the Dictator of Khwarezm must urgently return to the capital and suppress this palace coup."
khiva.8.a: "Junaid-Khan turns his troops back on the capital..."

khiva.9.t: "March on Khiva"
khiva.9.d: "Gathering additional Mujahideen units along the way, Junaid-Khan announced a march on Khiva. He urged the citizens to rally around him as a true representative of all the peoples of the Khanate, not just a small group of Uzbeks at the mouth of the Amu Darya.\n\nHowever, in Khiva itself, with its predominantly Uzbek population, Junaid-khan met fierce resistance. Many of the palace and city guards defected to the conspirators, as did the population, who were clearly in favor of the Young Khiva's reforms.\n\nThe situation was uncertain and with roughly equal numbers of opposing forces, the outcome of the battle for Khiva remains unknown..."
khiva.9.a: "The loyalists storm the palace and arrest the conspirators..."
khiva.9.b: "Junaid-Khan forces swept away, the conspirators gain a foothold in Khwarezm..."

khiva.10.t: "The Last Nail in the Coffin of Dictatorship"
khiva.10.d: "The Provisional Council was able to repel the Mujahideen attack on the capital of the Khanate. Junaid Khan's troops were pushed beyond the original Khiva and dispersed across the Karakum desert. Rumors reached us that Junaid-Khan himself was settling in Ashgabat, gathering another army to fight us.\n\nBut even now, with our small forces, we have been able to rally the people and establish control over the northern part of the Khanate. \n\nThe Provisional Council announced reforms, the adoption of a constitution and limiting the role of the monarch."
khiva.10.a: "We must now secure control of Karakum"

khiva.11.t: "Khiva Massacre"
khiva.11.d: "The last few days will go down in history as terrible days for the Khanate of Khiva. More terrible than the Soviet attack and the coup of 1918. \n\nThe streets of the ancient city were sprinkled with the blood of the rebels and protesters, as well as all those who in any way tried to hold the defense in the city. Many were killed, but the disgraceful leadership of the opposition, the vile conspirators, were able to move back to the lands of Turkestan. \n\nThe Dictator of Khwarezm has regained power and order will now be restored with an even harsher hand."
khiva.11.a: "The reign of Junaid-Khan is preserved."

khiva.12.t: "Junaid-Khan Sends Support"
khiva.12.d: "Junaid-Khan, Vizier of Khiva, Dictator of Khwarezm, has sent us two divisions of Mujahideen, ready to fight for their faith. This will greatly help us in our efforts against [DEH.GetName]"
khiva.12.a: "We are very grateful."

khiva.13.t: "Successful Delivery"
khiva.13.d: "The weapons have smoothly passed the borders and are now stored in the port of Krasnovodsk. We should now decide what to do with the weapons."
khiva.13.a: "Nice."

khiva.14.t: "The Delivery Failed"
khiva.14.d: "As a result of circumstances beyond our control, a valuable cargo with the latest weapons has been lost, and we have no choice but to mourn for the gold spent."
khiva.14.a: "Damn."

khiva.15.t: "Illegal Gun-Runners Exposed"
khiva.15.d: "We managed to catch the smugglers ashore the Caspian Sea with tons of our weaponry ready to sail abroad. From the interrogation, we found out who the customer was, and it turned out to be the Khivan Khan's vizier, Junaid-Khan, the Dictator of Khwarezm. With the gun-runners exposed, our government has put them on trial, also launching a large-scale investigation into leaks in weapons depots, and has also expressed a diplomatic protest to Khiva, restricting all trade with them."
khiva.15.a: "No smuggling in Russia will be tolerated."

khiva.16.t: "Russian Government Outraged"
khiva.16.d: "The Russian government managed to expose our contact, confiscating tons of weaponry, ready to sail to us. They quickly found out who the customer was, and now their government has seized all the contacts with us, also enacting embargo."
khiva.16.a: "One less market, it seems."

khiva.17.t: "Turkmens Hinder Deliveries"
khiva.17.d: "The southern tribes have intercepted arms shipments, effectively blocking the flow from [PER.GetName]. It seems that until we deal with them, we cannot effectively smuggle [PER.GetAdjective] arms."
khiva.17.a: "Bastards."

khiva.18.t: "Weapons from Khiva"
khiva.18.d: "We were informed that certain organisations in our country smuggle weapons from Khiva, produced by other countries. While this is illegal, we can use this situation for our own good, demanding our share and supplying our army."
khiva.18.a: "That's a great idea."
khiva.18.b: "No, that will bolster corruption."

khiva.19.t: "Successful Delivery!"
khiva.19.d: "We managed to successfully smuggle the weapons at inflated prices, receiving good amount of gold into our treasury. Now we have to decide what to do with it."
khiva.19.a: "Great!"

khiva.20.t: "The Delivery Failed"
khiva.20.d: "As a result of circumstances beyond our control, a valuable cargo with the latest weapons has been lost, and we have no choice but to mourn for the weapons we could use for ourselves."
khiva.20.a: "Damn."

khiva.21.t: "Firm Hand of Junaid-Khan"
khiva.21.d: "The 1936 has just began only to inform the closest confederates of Junaid-Khan about his illness. The 79-year old Yomud, Dictator of Khwarezm, who has been in power for 18 years, has not only become too paranoid and physically ill, but, perhaps... mentally ill, as well.\n\nThe Jadidist movement of Young Khivans, who has for long been a cause for all Khan's crackdowns on freedom, has gained some strength over the years, especially after the neighboring Turkestan Republic gained some stability and strength.\n\nMoreover, some of the Turkmen tribes in the south became too unruly, blocking the trade ways from Persia and Afghanistan, raiding on the caravans and preventing gold, goods and weapons from reaching the Junaid-Khan's treasury. It's time to deal with all these problems, while the dictator is still alive."
khiva.21.a: "The rule of Junaid-Khan is under threat."

khiva.22.t: "Pacifying the Southern Tribes"
khiva.22.d: "The Southern Turkmen tribes have been rebelling against our rule since 1935, when Junaid-Khan has demanded more tribute from them, due to the economic isolation of the Khanate. When they refused, he ordered to incinerate fertile fields and burn villages to the ground. This criminal order was successfully carried out by his henchmen, depriving the khanate of some of the harvest, and some Turkmen tribes of families, shelter and food.\n\nThe Turkmen tribes should be pacified now, and the old Dictator suggested that he should visit their elders himself and make them respect him. While some of his henchmen believe this to be generally a bad idea, no one dares to dissuade Junaid-Khan, fearing for his head."
khiva.22.a: "The Dictator shall visit them himself."
khiva.22.b: "Not this time. Just burn their villages again."
khiva.22.c: "Appease them with Junaid-Khan's gold."

khiva.23.t: "Junaid-Khan Murdered!"
khiva.23.d: "During his visit to the rebellious tribes in the south of the Khanate, Junaid-Khan was killed during negotiations. Out of a sudden, a local Turkmen from a rebellious tribe has shot Junaid, and after he fell on the ground he was then hit with sabers several times. The loyal Mujahideen who were to guard the vizier were also killed, unable to resist. With this inglorious death, the long era of Junaid-Khan's dictatorship over Khorezm seems to have ended, but its future is not yet fully determined."

khiva.24.t: "Southern Tribes Brutally Pacified"
khiva.24.d: "The Turkmen revolt was brutally suppressed as a result of the Mujahideen' actions in Southern Transcaspia. With this act of terror it seems that Junaid-Khan has only contributed to the disunity, that reigns among the Turkmens, though securing his power."
khiva.24.a: "Let them know their place."

khiva.25.t: "Southern Tribes Pacified"
khiva.25.d: "The Turkmen tribes were appeased with gold and once again the good word about Junaid-Khan, a Yomud Turkmen, spread across the deserts of Qaraqum."
khiva.25.a: "Let us enjoy the fruits of loyalty."

khiva.28.t: "Raid Successful"
khiva.28.d: "We managed to seize some supplies from our neighbors, with loyal Mujahideen already marching to visit Junaid-Khan and show what they got."
khiva.28.a: "Nice."

khiva.29.t: "Raid Failed"
khiva.29.d: "We were unable to seize anything from our neighbours. Their forces managed to secure their citizens and lands from our raiders."
khiva.29.a: "Too bad."

khiva.30.t: "Loot Seized by Raiders"
khiva.30.d: "The raiders successfully seized some supplies from our neighbors, but they refused to give it to the Khan, seizing them for themselves!"
khiva.30.a: "Neither bad nor good, to be honest."

khiva.31.t: "[KHI.GetAdjective] Raiders Retreat!"
khiva.31.d: "Some raiders from the Khanate of Khiva have rushed into our lands, seizing all they can from our people. Fortunately, we managed to strike back and force them to retreat back to where they came from. We should write a letter to [KHI.GetLeader] and demand he better look after banditry in his lands."
khiva.31.a: "Glad we got rid of them."

khiva.32.t: "We Were Raided!"
khiva.32.d: "Some raiders from the Khanate of Khiva have rushed into our lands, seizing all they can from our people. Unfortunately, we could not stop them. We should write a letter to [KHI.GetLeader] and demand he better look after banditry in his lands."
khiva.32.a: "We should be prepared next time"

khiva.33.t: "The Eternal City"
khiva.33.d: "In a resplendent display of cultural revival, the city of Khiva celebrates its 2440th anniversary with a renewed commitment to its rich historical traditions. The streets are adorned with majestic decorations, evoking the grandeur of the past. The event is marked by traditional ceremonies, showcasing the deep reverence for Khiva's ancestral customs and the restoration of its ancient splendor. From the regal procession to the captivating performances, every aspect of the celebration pays homage to the enduring legacy of the city's illustrious history."
khiva.33.d2: "As Khiva commemorates its 2440th anniversary, the city bursts with a palpable sense of progress and transformation. The celebration takes on a modern twist, reflecting the spirit of innovation and forward-thinking. Alongside the traditional festivities, there are exhibitions showcasing technological advancements, interactive displays highlighting modern achievements, and panel discussions on fostering economic growth and social development. The event serves as a catalyst for embracing a new era, embracing change while honoring the city's rich heritage."
khiva.33.d3: "Under the banner of absolute authority, Khiva's 2440th anniversary celebration takes on a grandiose tone. The event becomes a magnificent display of power, with the ruler and his loyal entourage presiding over the festivities. Military parades, ostentatious displays of wealth, and lavish ceremonies showcase the might and dominance of the absolute ruler. The celebration is a testament to the ruler's vision of restoring Khiva's former glory and cementing their unquestionable authority."
khiva.33.d4: "As Khiva commemorates its 2440th anniversary, the city becomes a symbol of resilience and democratic aspirations. The celebration becomes a platform for open dialogue, where intellectuals, activists, and community leaders gather to discuss the future of the city. Public speeches, peaceful demonstrations, and artistic expressions highlight the quest for democratic reform, advocating for the rights of the people and the establishment of inclusive governance. The event becomes a beacon of freedom, marking a pivotal moment in Khiva's journey towards democratic transformation."
khiva.33.d5: "In a paradoxical display of control and suppression, Khiva's 2440th anniversary celebration takes on an eerie atmosphere. The streets are lined with security forces, their presence casting a shadow over the festivities. The event becomes a carefully orchestrated spectacle, where performances and cultural displays are tightly controlled, mirroring the iron grip of the ruling regime. Amidst the forced cheerfulness, a sense of unease lingers, reminding the people of the price they pay for dissent."
khiva.33.d6: "With a unique focus on Khiva's nomadic roots, the city's 2440th anniversary celebration takes a captivating turn. The event showcases the nomadic lifestyle that once defined the region, with traditional yurts, camel caravans, and nomadic rituals creating an immersive experience. Visitors can partake in traditional nomadic games, taste authentic nomadic cuisine, and engage in activities that celebrate the nomadic spirit. The celebration becomes a testament to Khiva's nomadic heritage, reinforcing the bond between its people and their ancestral identity."
khiva.33.a: "A vibrant tapestry of tradition and unity!"

khiva.34.t: "Junaid-Khan's Health Deteriorates"
khiva.34.d: "Today, the closest associates of Junaid-Khan were given piece of information, that the Vizier's health is becoming worse and that his glorious days are coming to an end."
khiva.34.a: "Age has its limits."

khiva.35.t: "The New Vizier of Khiva"
khiva.35.d: "With the opposition gaining a foothold in the Khivan oasis and keeping large amount of resources under their control, it is time to settle the most vital issues.\n\nThe most important one - is the question of power. The opposition, consisting of both Young Khivans and former loyalists of murdered Isfandiyar-khan are experiencing great difficulties in cooperating. Ishahoja Hojaev, appointed as the Vizier of the Supervisory Council, or Nozirlar Kengashi, is a staunch Kadimist and reactionary. He's not really a supporter of constitutional monarchy, Young Khivans have been promoted all these years. But he actually has no choice at all. With Sayid Abdullah-khan being a titular monarch all these years, in fact, under house arrest, he's known to be a weak and naive person. Whether these differences between coalition partners will be eventually resolved is an open question, though."
khiva.35.a: "Let us hope Khiva will remain stable."

khiva.36.t: "Usul-i-Jadid"
khiva.36.d: "The Junaid-Khan regime practically did not deal with the modernization of education or education in general. Young Khivans advocated the introduction of a new method in mektebs and madrasahs - the sound method of literacy teaching to replace the alphabetic one. The obsolete religious schools of Khorezm had to be replaced by national secular schools and science and culture had to be developed.\n\nThe plans of the Young Khiva include the establishment of a solid academic year with examinations and a transition to a class-lesson system of teaching. In addition, the new-method schools should introduce standard European ways of teaching: desks, gradebooks, benches, blackboards, division of students into classes, and class time into lessons. Other secular disciplines should also be greatly expanded. Schools should teach history (tarihi), geography, and arithmetic in addition to religion.\n\nAll this has long existed in the schools of Russia and Turkestan, and Khorezm has lagged far behind not only the modernized Western powers, but even its neighbors. The Vizier is expected to pass this bill, otherwise Khiva will remain backward."
khiva.36.a: "Our people in a desperate need of modern education."

khiva.37.t: "Writing the Constitution"
khiva.37.d: "The Nozirlar Kengashi finally sat down to write Khorezm's supreme legal document - the first time in its centuries-long history a constitution was planned - and to limit the monarch's power on paper. And for centuries to come. Fortunately, Sayid Abdullah Khan is a weak and unambitious man, who will not be able to prevent it in any way, like the Emir of Bukhara. \n\nThe main difficulty at this stage will be to negotiate the constitution with the more conservative coalition partners and the Vizier, who may react negatively to the radical modernist reforms of Young Khiva."
khiva.37.a: "Let the Council see sense."

khiva.38.t: "Council Splits on Property Question"
khiva.38.d: "On the issue of property, the Council could not reach a consensus. The most radical Jadidists, as well as members of the Communist Party of Khorezm, considered it necessary and important to nationalize the property and all resources of the Khanate, as well as to expropriate Khan's property.\n\nDespite years of stealing from the inhabitants of Khorezm and the enormous accumulation of treasury wealth, some of which Junaid-Khan was able to export, the conservative Nazirs opposed such radical measures."
khiva.38.a: "We will decide this question by a separate decree later."

khiva.39.t: "Limitation of Khan"
khiva.39.d: "One of the main articles of the constitution should be the legal establishment of a limited monarchy. On this question, a sudden discussion first broke out, and the radical Young Khivans and Communists proposed to abolish the monarchy in general and establish a republican system. However, all in all, citing the incompetence of Said Abdullah Khan, the Council was able to agree on the most important reform - the adoption of a constitutional monarchy."
khiva.39.a: "Agreed."

khiva.40.t: "The Parliament"
khiva.40.d: "Another important issue in the discussion of the constitution was the institution of Parliament. In accordance with the 1917 draft reforms, the Young Khiva proposed the creation of a bicameral parliament, the Majlis. The upper chamber should be the Nozirlar Kengashi itself, and the government should be formed after the elections. \n\nHowever, this was sharply opposed by conservative lawmakers, who argued that it would be much more effective to create a unicameral parliament and strengthen the power of the government. Such a project would prevent effective representation of all ethnic groups living in Khorezm, including the majority Turkmen and a minority of Uzbeks and Karakalpaks."
khiva.40.a: "A bicamerial structure is appreciated."
khiva.40.b: "One-chambered parliament with strong government."

khiva.41.t: "Administrative Division"
khiva.41.d: "The issue of administrative division was also hotly debated. The proposal of the leftist ministers was to introduce special autonomous Vyaylets for the Turkmen and Karakalpaks, but the conservatives opposed any singling out of special autonomies, arguing that this would destroy the great Khorezm state, which should be centralized and united. "
khiva.41.a: "Divide the Khanate into equal Vilayats"
khiva.41.b: "Special autonomies for Karakalpak and Turkmen people."

khiva.42.t: "The First Khivan Constitution"
khiva.42.d: "Finally, the Constitution of Khorezm was officially adopted today. The first of its kind. This is a great breakthrough for our state. Tomorrow morning the text of the new Constitution will be in all the newspapers of the country, and now it is time to hold the first elections to the Majlis and form a legitimate government. Of course, if the Vizier doesn't interfere in any way..."
khiva.42.a: "A great success for our country!"

khiva.43.t: "The New-Method Schools Rejected by Vizier"
khiva.43.d: "Unfortunately, the project proposed by the Young Khivans to introduce new-methodical schools in Khorezm failed... The Vizier, Ishahoja Hojaev, suppressed the bill by refusing to sign it. It seems that the confrontation between Jadidists and Kadimists will only intensify after this unlawful ban. \n\nAlready now Young Khiva understands that the Vizier is becoming an insurmountable obstacle on the way to democratization and modenization of Khorezm, while the Vizier himself is already openly criticizing the reformers."
khiva.43.a: "Another obstacle on our path to modernization!"

khiva.44.t: "An Important Bill Rejected by the Council"
khiva.44.d: "Today, a bill proposed by the radical part of Young Khiva, together with the Communists, to control the state treasury was rejected in the Council. Conservatives criticized the draft for its radical nature and declared that the state treasury should not be subjected to any changes, and in general it was better not to be touched by anyone except the Treasurer, Khan, and Vizier."
khiva.44.a: "Nazirs become a real hindrance to us!"

khiva.45.t: "Tensions Grow in Nozirlar Kengashi"
khiva.45.d: "A number of radical bills have recently been rejected by conservative ministers or rejected by the Vizier, and with this there is growing overt tension between conservatives and reformers.\n\nThe Young Khivans are becoming really disenchanted with the ideas of constitutional monarchy and are very concerned about the Kadimist sentiments in society. The failure to hold elections, which have long been on the horizon, also adds to the tension."
khiva.45.a: "At least the country is stabilizing"

khiva.46.t: "Flaws in the Constitutional System"
khiva.46.d: "The system adopted by the Nozirlar Kengashi proved to be completely unsuitable. In particular, the reformers did not foresee that the appointment of elections takes place with the approval of the Vizier, who had already been postponing them for several months. Moreover, the Vizier has no right to cancel them, but can only postpone them. This parade of postponements has been going on for quite some time.\n\nIn this connection, at a joint meeting of the parties of Young Khiva and Communists, the procedure for the next postponement of the elections was agreed upon. The radicals proposed a radical option - the overthrow of the monarchy and the Vizier and the long-awaited liberation of Khorezm from authoritarianism and nepotism. On the other hand, the more moderate Young Khiva believe that the monarchy itself does not pose any threat, and the problem is only in the conservatives, who actually hold power by force, because their public support is obviously much less than that of the Young Khiva."
khiva.46.a: "Elections are once again postponed"

khiva.47.t: "Political Crisis Gains Momentum"
khiva.47.d: "The protracted political crisis brewing on the sidelines of the Majlis seems about to peak. Recently, the revolution's only success has been the adoption of a constitution - and it has not been fully respected. The tension between reformers and conservatives is already so great that the Young Khiva ignores the Council's meetings in their entirety, depriving it of a quorum. \n\nBekjon Rakhmon, one of the leftist leaders of Young Khiva, for the first time made an open demand to the Nozirlar Kengashi - to resign all the reactionaries preventing modernization, including the Vizier."
khiva.47.a: "The reactionaries should resign!"

khiva.48.t: "Young Khivans' Disappointment Grows"
khiva.48.d: "With the conservatives unwilling to contribute in any way to modernization, the Communists and Young Khiva gathered for an emergency council to organize a revolution. There was no turning back, and the realization of the need for a Second Revolution had already reached all members of both parties.\n\nHowever, the Council has not yet agreed on how power will be arranged after the successful overthrow of the conservatives. The Communists undoubtedly insist on the overthrow of the monarchy as a whole and a transition to a socialist democratic system, but such an approach is not echoed by some Young Khivaites, including their spiritual and political leader Boboohun Salimov. In the event that the Revolution decides to leave the monarch in power, it is quite possible that the Communists will abandon us. However, we may not fear them, as their popularity is extremely low."
khiva.48.a: "Monarchy is ultimately an archaic obstruction!"
khiva.48.b: "It is Hojaev who prevents the reforms!"

khiva.49.t: "Boboohun Tries to Negotiate with Vizier"
khiva.49.d: "With the political crisis looming, Boboohun Salimov, leader of the Young Khiva Party, has attempted to negotiate with the conservative members of the Nozirlar Kengashi, especially the Vizier, in order to settle the issues and problems between the liberals and reactionary ministers.\n\nFormer Qazi, the Judge, despite his liberal stance, is a person of great respect even among the most reactionary ministers. The Vizier listened to him and hopefully, he understood all the importance of the modernization. However, his final decision is yet to be announced."
khiva.49.a: "Ishahoja Hojaev refused to step down"
khiva.49.b: "For the sake of nation, Hojaev steps down..."

khiva.50.t: "Bobo Ahun Demands Khan's Abdication"
khiva.50.d: "The leader of the Young Khivans, Bobo Ahun, demands that Sayid Abdullah should abdicate from his throne. While the Khan was shocked to hear about the Boboohun's wild proposal, he agrees, at least somewhat, that the Khanate needs modernization to survive."
khiva.50.a: "He is reasonable. The Khan should abdicate."
khiva.50.b: "This is nonsense. The Khan will stay as a constitutional monarch and reform gradually."

khiva.51.t: "Young Khiva Revolution"
khiva.51.d: "Outraged by the Hojaev's words and his unwillingness to allow for Khiva’s rapid modernization and reform, the Young Khiva Party has organized mass protests in the city of Khiva and its outlying nomad towns. The Vizier has mobilized the Mujahideen to disperse the crowd, but the power of revolutionaries is only growing."
khiva.51.a: "Send the Mujahideen to crush these reformers"

khiva.52.t: "Armed Conflict in Khiva"
khiva.52.d: "There are numerous reports coming in from the south about armed conflicts between Young Khiva protesters and the reactionary militants led by Ishahoja Hojaev. The streets of the ancient city are being bathed in blood as the opposing forces clash for the soul of Khiva. Despite the victor, it seems that the bloodshed cannot be avoided and will rage on until one side finally falters."
khiva.52.a: "Attempt to agree to the Young Khiva's demands."
khiva.52.b: "Mobilize more forces in Khiva to crush them."

khiva.53.t: "Young Khiva Victory"
khiva.53.d: "The Mujahideen were completely destroyed in Khiva with Young Khivans raising the flag of a liberated Khiva high over the city. Their braveness has encouraged other citizens in Khivan cities across the nation to rise up as well in protest and revolt and today the personal forces and royal guard of Khan Sayid Abdullah himself were crushed as well, signalling the end of his horrid reign. The Khan has been forced to abdicate and has fled into exile while the Young Khiva Party has declared the Republic of Khiva in Khiva where the first battle was won."
khiva.53.a: "Long Live the Khorezm Republic!"

khiva.54.t: "Vizier's Victory"
khiva.54.d: "The Young Khiva protesters were completely and utterly annihilated in Khiva with Mujahideen forces ending the fighting with burning of the Young Khivan’s republican flags. Sayid Abdullah, Khan of Khiva, has arrived to personally congratulate the Mujahideen on their victory. Now nothing can stop Khiva from respecting the traditions of Qadimism."
khiva.54.a: "Long Live the Khanate!"

khiva.55.t: "First Khorezm Elections"
khiva.55.d: "With the reactionaries finally gone, the country was free to held the first ever democratic elections. With only two parties participating, it is expected for much more popular Young Khiva to win a significant majority of mandates."
khiva.55.a: "Turkmen Communists surprisingly manage to win."
khiva.55.b: "Young Khivans’ convincing victory"

khiva.56.t: "Uncontrolled Food Prices"
khiva.56.d: "After agricultural exports were halted, the price of these goods rose substantially as producers were left without income. At the same time, prices proved to be too high and rose almost exponentially. On the other hand, no one can afford to buy these goods, much less our foreign importers.\n\nThe situation is clearly out of control, and urgent measures must be taken - namely, the establishment of a monopoly on prices by the state. Although this is a temporary and rather radical measure, it could allow us to stop the rise in prices."
khiva.56.a: "A dangerous situation"

khiva.57.t: "Khivan Economy Collapses!"
khiva.57.d: "The sharp increase in the price of agricultural products only spurred inflation. The Khorezm Tenga has lost almost all of its value, and many locals have already switched to barter. In fact, we can talk about the collapse of the economy, the difficulties of sowing and exporting agricultural products aggravated the situation, and in fact all production and manufactory stopped. It is not known whether we will ever be able to get out of this situation..."
khiva.57.a: "Devastating!"

khiva.58.t: "Agricultural Prices Monopoly"
khiva.58.d: "By decree of Junaid-Khan, a monopoly was imposed on the prices of agricultural products throughout the Khanate. Now, the rise in prices was stopped and fixed at a level just above the pre-crisis level, but this could not stop the striking decline in the quality of life, and the growth of all-pervasive poverty.\n\nJunaid-Khan now faces a long-term plan to diversify the local economy with the hope of increasing production, but we should not expect significant growth in industry in the near future."
khiva.58.a: "Will Khiva recover from this?"

khiva.59.t: "Shortage of Food!"
khiva.59.d: "With the agricultural exports from Khiva completely stopped, we now face a shortage of food, which can eventually cause even famine! It is unlikely that [KHI.GetName] will go on with agricultural exports anytime soon. Food staples became scarce as agricultural supplies dwindled. Wheat, rice, and other dietary essentials vanished from store shelves, leaving the population to grapple with the looming specter of hunger. We must find new markets to buy food for our citizens, until it is too late."
khiva.59.a: "We should find other markets for now."

khiva.60.t: "Atabayev Consolidates His Power"
khiva.60.d: "Gaygysyz Atabayev has finally being appointed as the Premier of [ROOT.GetName]. With the loyal ministers appointed as well, it is time for the reforms, and, perhaps, some of them can be seen even as radical for the Khorezm.\n\nBeing an ethnic Turkmen, from Yomud Tribe, Atabayev now is looking forward to transforming the Khorezm People's Republic into a more national-oriented socialist republic of Turkmens, where the Uzbeks and Karakalpaks are only minorities."
khiva.60.a: "Uzbeks are a minority in our new, Turkmen, state!"

khiva.61.t: "Left Young Khivans Split!"
khiva.61.d: "With the tensions in Young Khiva Party rising over the last few months, the leader of the left-wing, Polvonniyoz Khodzhi Yusupov, has announced the establishment of a new party - Khorezm Socialist Party. Decades ago, during the Soviet Intervention, he had already left the Young Khivans and was one of the founding members of the Khorezm Communist Party, that seized to exist as soon as Bolsheviks were driven out of Turkestan. Now, the legacy of the Communist party, seems to live on with Polvonniyoz announcing HSP. This time their policies are based more on SR program, that is by a large extent more a peasant-oriented problem, than the Bolsheviks had."
khiva.61.d2: "With the tensions in Young Khiva Party on rise, after Boboohun Salimov refused to abolish the monarchy, the leader of the left-wing, Polvonniyoz Khodzhi Yusupov, has announced the establishment of a new party - Khorezm Socialist Party. Decades ago, during the Soviet Intervention, he had already left the Young Khivans and was one of the founding members of the Khorezm Communist Party, that seized to exist as soon as Bolsheviks were driven out of Turkestan. Now, the legacy of the Communist party, seems to live on with Polvonniyoz announcing HSP. This time their policies are based more on SR program, that is by a large extent more a peasant-oriented problem, than the Bolsheviks had."
khiva.61.a: "We welcome Khivan socialists!"
khiva.61.b: "Without them is better."

khiva.62.t: "Abolition of Young Khiva"
khiva.62.d: "Since the establishment of the HSP and larging tendencies of authoritarianism during Atabayev's rule, the Young Khiva party eventually disbanded itself, with their former members either joining XSP or YHP. Now, there are only two parties left in the region, with XSP far more popular in the Uzbek-majority regions, while YHP gets landslide victories in the majority of districts, where the Turkmens live."
khiva.62.a: "Glad they realized all advantages of socialism!"

khiva.63.t: "Turkmen Identity Effort"
khiva.63.d: "The Turkmens are in majority Nomadic tribes, that wandered the Karakum desert for several centuries without ever settling down. With the modernization and urbanization coming to Transcaspian Region with the Russian colonization, the Turkmens were oppressed - firstly under the Khivan Khans of Uzbek origin and later by Russian colonizers. Now, the Turkmens are finally free. With the decision to transform Khorezm into a Turkmen state, Atabayev now faces several issues considering the Turkmen identity.\n\nFirst of all, he can base the Turkmen identity on heroic deeds of the past, like Seljuk and Khwarazmian Empires. But this will probably make our regime more nationalist. On the other hand, we can connect identity to our traditions of nomadic life and collectivism. Finally, we can focus on being always oppressed by large Empires, like Khivan and Russian ones and base our indentity on being anti-colonialist and anti-Imperialist."
khiva.63.a: "Base identity on heroic past of Seljuks and Khwarezmians"
khiva.63.b: "Socialism is inherent to Turkmens due to their history of tribalism and communalism"
khiva.63.c: "Turkmen is an anticolonialist. A true hero and protector of his land."

khiva.64.t: "The First Congress of Halk Maslahaty"
khiva.64.d: "With the YHP's successful policies in Turkmenistan, more and more dehkans and Turkmens are becoming aware of their identity and start to act as citizens. With this in mind, Atabayev issued establishment of numerous local councils all around the country with locals being elected. A true local self-government is being developed, but YHP decided to take the next step. With special decree of the government, the Majlis is to be transformed into Halk Maslahaty (People's Council). It should be now formed through a multi-level council system, similar to those of Russian narodniks.\n\nWith elections to the new Parliament held soon after the change, the new composition of the Halk Maslahaty has gathered in order to held a Congress. The absolute majority of the mandates were given to the deputies from YHP with a small number of non-partisans and candidates from XSP and former Young Khivans\n\nThe Congress re-appointed Atabayev as the Premier of Turkmenistan and adopted a new program of national development.\nThis opens a bright new page of Turkmen history."
khiva.64.a: "A smooth transition to the socialist system!"

KHI_national_communism: "§Y[ROOT.GetLeader]:§! will change ideology to §Y$radsoc_national_communism_subtype$§!"
KHI_left_nationalism: "§Y[ROOT.GetLeader]:§! will change ideology to §Y$left_nationalism_subtype$§!"


khiva.65.t: "Rise of Turkmen Nationalism"
khiva.65.d: "With our new identity efforts, the Turkmen nationalism has been recently on rise. With various Chiefs and local leaders now actively forcing the nationalist stance among the members of their tribes. This can be a dangerous situation and we should somehow try to curtail nationalist ambitions of our people, stating than the expansionist wars are in the past and now we should develop ourselves economically in the first place."
khiva.65.a: "We're a modern, socialist state!"
khiva.65.b: "We can use them in order to bolster Turkmen patriotism"

khiva.70.t: "Fate of Sayid Abdullah-khan"
khiva.70.d: "With the Palace Coup and recent unrest, [ROOT.GetLeader] has made up his mind about the fate of Khivan monarchy. On one hand, the Titular Khan, as the descendant of Gengis Khan gave enough stability and legitimacy to the Junaid-Khan's regime. But since the latest events, his value as a figurehead has drastically changed. Sayid Abdullah-khan is now nothing more than a weak and probably sick man, under house arrest in the palace, taking up some place. His life is rather pointless now.\n\nThere are several choices what we can do with the Khan now. The first is to exile him and proclaim a republic. Moreover, build a new republic with strong Turkmen national identity. But this plan has some disadvantages, as the foreign countries can use Sayid Abdullah-khan same as we did. The second plan is rather brutal - to end the pathetic life of his, depriving others of the opportunity to use Khan as an excuse for their aggression. By doing so, we will consolidate our power and can either establish a Turkmen republic, or proclaim a new Dynasty of Junaid-Khan and his descendants."
khiva.70.a: "Send this poor man into exile."
khiva.70.b: "Sayid Abdullah-khan will face the same fate as his brother. Republic is proclaimed."
khiva.70.c: "Establish a new royal dynasty."

khiva.71.t: "Exiled Khivan Khan Asked For Shelter"
khiva.71.d: "Early in the morning the borders of our state were approached by several people. When the guards asked them who they are and what they seek in [ROOT.GetName], they were quite wondered to hear the answer. According to the words of the man and his company, he was the Khan of Khiva! But it was rather hard to believe in it, since the man was in pretty common clothes and the Khivan Khan was heard to never appear in public for the last 5 years. It would have been totally a nonsensical story, if not the news from Khwarezm earlier this week about abandoning monarchy.\n\nThe border guards telegraphed to the [ROOT.Capital.GetName] in order to know what to do with a man, who claimed to be the Khan of Khiva. After some hours, he was taken to the capital, where he was recognized as a legitimate Khivan Khan. Only after that this information was reported to [ROOT.GetLeader] who had to decide what to do with the exiled monarch."
khiva.71.a: "We welcome the legitimate ruler of Khwarezm!"
khiva.71.b: "Ridiculuous! Send him away!"

khiva.72.t: "A State Turkmens Deserve"
khiva.72.d: "Long centuries of lacking national identity are finally over, as well as the monarchy of Uzbek Qungrats, that prevented our great nation from building up. The new state of Türkmenistan shall appear on the world map and history books."
khiva.72.a: "Glory to [ROOT.GetLeader] and the nation of Türkmenistan!"

khiva.73.d: ""
khiva.73.a: "First option"
khiva.73.b: "Second option"

khiva.74.c: "Third option"

khiva.75.t: "The New Khan"
khiva.75.d: "In a bold and decisive move, [ROOT.GetLeader], the charismatic leader of Khiva, has seized power, casting aside weak Sayid Abdullah Khan and claiming the mantle of true leadership. With unwavering determination and the support of his loyal followers, [ROOT.GetLeader] has risen from a military leader to the rightful Khan of Khwarezm. The legacy of the old Khanate is now firmly in the hands of [ROOT.GetLeader] and his faction, who see themselves as the rightful heirs to the empires of the old, namely the Khwarezmian and Seljuk empires. They believe that it is their duty to restore the glory and grandeur of these ancient realms and usher in a new era of power and prestige for Khiva.\n\nAs the new Khan, [ROOT.GetLeader] assumes the responsibility of guiding Khwarezm towards a future defined by strength, prosperity, and cultural resurgence. The journey ahead may be fraught with challenges, but with our leader's strategic acumen, leadership prowess, and unwavering commitment to the Khwarezmian legacy, the nation stands poised to reclaim its rightful place among the great powers of the world. Together, under the banner of the new dynasty, Khwarezm shall rise once more, revitalizing the spirit of the ancient empires and forging a path of progress, unity, and unparalleled greatness. The dawn of a new era is upon us, and the people of Khiva stand united in their belief that, with Junaid-Khan at the helm, Khwarezm shall prosper like never before."
khiva.75.a: "Finally, under the new dynasty, Khwarezm shall prosper!"

khiva.76.t: "The Qiniqs Raise From Grave of History"
khiva.76.d: "After centuries of obscurity, we shall take the mantle of the Qiniqs, as we are the rightful heirs of the ancient Seljuk dynasty, as we are determined to reclaim our rightful place as the rulers of Khwarezm. Led by the visionary [ROOT.GetLeader] and his faction, who claim to be the rightful heirs to the Seljuk Empire, we embark on a journey to resurrect the ancient glory of our lands.

khiva.77.d: "In a momentous turn of events, our great state sets its sights on restoring the historic Shahdom of Khwarezm. Under the leadership of the charismatic and ambitious [ROOT.GetLeader], who claims to be the rightful heir of the Khwarezmian Empire, the time has come to revive the glorious legacy of our ancestors. With the banner of the Shahs unfurled once again, we march towards the restoration of the mighty Khwarezmian Empire, forging a new chapter in our history."

After a long road through Qyzylqum desert, his destination is the ancient city of Khiva, where another power struggle is already heating up."

khiva.81.a: "Öňe, türkmenler!"

khiva.82.t: "Alliance With [FROM.GetName]?"
khiva.82.d: "After the Khivan monarchy was successfully reinstated and consolidated, the local Vizier, Ishahoja Hojaev, has approached our government with a request to form once a great alliance between our nations. While they want to join us as equals, retaining all their current lands, we can possibly force them into a protectorate form of Imperial autonomy, once already forced against them."

khiva.86.t: "Requesting the British Help"
khiva.86.d: "Azis-Khan, unlike his former commander Oraz Serdar, has never been a staunch supporter of alliance with the British. However, with the British control over neighboring Afghanistan secured, perhaps it would be wise to invite a British military mission in Khwarezm. This idea is, however, opposed by the current Vizier, head of the Turkmen Committee, Hajy Myrat, who is looking forward an alliance with the Ottomans."

khiva.88.t: "British Military Mission"
khiva.88.d: "With the British conquest of Afghanistan, the Entente was firmly entrenched in the region, and now, the governments of the Empire and India formally offered assistance to us as well.\n\nWhile headed not by Wilfrid Malleson, as during the Civil War, but by John Nichols, the British mission would include primarily military assistance, but the Crown was prepared to consider economic assistance as well, if necessary."

khiva.90.t: "The British Coup in Khiva!"
khiva.90.d: "With the neighboring [UZB.GetName] claiming to become the Turkestan's one and only national government, the local British Mission, headed by John Nichols, has activized. Today, it became known that in major cities of Urgench and Khiva, the British soldiers have seized the Khan's palace. Furthermore, they have also seized various administrative buildings in Ashgabat, while a major detachment of British soldiers intervened directly in Merv, seizing the region and claiming it as a part of [AFG.GetName]. Meanwhile, [ROOT.GetLeader] struggled to receive proper and authorized information about the events, as the telegraph lines were cut off. Soon, John Nichols has proclaimed the establishment of the Direct rule in Khiva and subordination to the Viceroy of Bukhara, Wilfrid Malleson."

khiva.91.d: "With Young Khiva securing majority at the recent elections, there's still one question, that remains - which wing of the party will lead the state into the future. On the left, there is a socialist wing, led by Polvonniyoz Khodzhi Yusupov. They support more radical reforms, considering taxation and are radically against any nobility empowerment.

khiva.93.d: "The Turkestan's most popular conservative party, Ittifoqi Muslimin, is now present in Khorezm. Former Vizier, Ishahoja Hojaev, has announced that he and his loyalists will join ranks with the Turkestani Qadimists. They plan to participate in the local elections and they can get a lot of supporters, considering they are likely to abandon their Uzbek-centric mindset, which means they will attract conservative-minded people of all nationalities. Furthermore, they also renounced their support of the Khivan monarchy, but it is likely that they are just ready to support another candidate for the throne if they manage to win."
khiva.93.a: "Disturbing."

khiva.94.t: "Nationalist Turkmen Party"
khiva.94.d: "Despite liberal stance and protection of the rights of the minorities, the Turkmen population was in dire need of representation and while they had it - not all liked the socialist ideas of Atabayev. Instead, the conservative and outright nationalist Turkmens now have a party to vote for.\n\nToday, the Agzybirlik movement was officially established on a congress in [584.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Closely connected to the Turkmen Committee, the new party will run in the next elections, as well as in the local ones, perhaps forming a serious opposition to our rule."
khiva.94.a: "We must prove to the Turkmen people!"

khiva.95.t: "Organisation of Trade Unions of Türkmenistan"
khiva.95.d.intro: "With the Türkmenistan slowly becoming a true nation-state, the large industrial centers, like Qizilsu and Ashgabat are growing in the proletariat proportion of the population. Workers, both Russophone or Muslim, are starting to organize themselves. Now, finally an organisation appeared, that sought to unite all trade unions in the new country - the TKAG (Türkmenistanyň kärdeşler arkalaşyklary guramasy)."
khiva.95.d: "$khiva.95.d.intro$ Atabayev has congratulated the organisation and even delivered a speech about importance of the working class to have official representation and even invited the TKAG to participate in the upcoming elections to the Halk Maslahaty."
khiva.95.d2: "$khiva.95.d.intro$ The creation of such an organisation was met with outrage from [ROOT.GetLeader] as he accused socialists and 'Bolsheviks' of revolutionizing the Turkmens. Immediately, the organisation's leaders were arrested and the TKAG was officially banned under the decree of our leader."
khiva.95.d3: "$khiva.95.d.intro$ The creation of such an organisation was, surprisingly, met with neutral stance by [ROOT.GetLeader]. Even though he mentioned that trade unions should be under control of the state, so that revolutionaries won't take any chances to destabilize the situation and sabotage the production."
khiva.95.a: "Great!"

khiva.96.t: "Crisis Provides Opportunity"
khiva.96.d: "For Junaid Khan, the sudden emptying of the treasury in connection with the economic crisis meant only one thing - the discontent of subordinates could lead to an open rebellion, in connection with which it was necessary to find a scapegoat. This was the current \"treasurer\", an associate of Junaid and a mujahid, who was accused of all the deadly sins, as he had, allegedly, caused the crisis by stealing from the treasury. Without much ado, Junaid Khan decided the Mujahid's fate. After all, it was the showy flogging that helped him hold on to power all these years.\n\nHowever, the question now is who to appoint in his place. On the one hand, the answer is obvious - it is high time for Eshi-Khan to start dealing with state affairs and the role of treasurer would suit him well. Besides, it will keep the treasury under control. On the other hand, Haji Myrat is pushing his protégé, Shaltai batr, for this position - he is a reliable financial advisor and will help to really deal with the economic crisis."
khiva.96.a: "The choice is obvious."

khiva.97.d: "Today we have received information from our agents in Afghanistan, that Junaid-Khan, a brigand warlord, who used to rule our country previously, has died from old age. While his son, Eshi-Khan, has proclaimed himself his heir and successor, it is unlikely that he will be a threat to us in the future. Despite the personality of Junaid-Khan, it is unlikely that his glory, be it well-deserved or notorious, can be ever eclipsed."
khiva.97.a: "He won't be missed."


khiva.98.t: "Legacy of Oraz Serdar"
khiva.98.d: "Oraz Serdar, son of Dykma Serdar, became one of the most influential and capable warlords of Turkmen tribes during the civil war. He received excellent military education in St. Petersburg and by 1914 he was a commander of one of the regiments of Turkmen Cavalry, bravely fought on the Weltkrieg fronts. In 1918, when the Menshevik Trans-Caspian government was established, it relied, among all others, on the Teke cavalry under the command of Oraz Serdar. He joined the Trans-Caspian government, along with Hajy Myrat, Nikolai Khan Yomudskiy and Sayid Myrat Ovez Baev. Later he also became one of the leaders of the Büzmeýin's Turkmen Committee.\n\nOraz Serdar became the Commander-in-Chief of the Trans-Caspian armed forces and the highest military rank was awarded to him by Lavr Kornilov, commander of the all 'White' armies of the South of Russia. The brave Teke warrior negotiated with Wilfrid Malleson and believed that the British will help in establishing sovereign Turkmen state. After the war ended, Trans-Caspian government was annexed into Russia, until 1925, when Junaid-Khan invaded the reion and Oraz Serdar pledged his loyalty to the Vizier.\n\nA few years later Oraz Serdar passed away, but the legacy of brave Teke general and his cavalry regiment might be important in building the identity of Turkmens."
khiva.98.a: "He is a brave hero of the Turkmen people!"
khiva.98.b: "He served Russians and British - there's no place to him in our history."

khiva.100.d: "The ancient city of Ashgabat has been struck by a devastating earthquake, leaving a trail of destruction and sorrow in its wake. The tremors have taken a toll on the lives of countless [KHI.GetAdjective] citizens, shattering homes, infrastructure, and the spirit of the affected communities. The seismic event has brought about a humanitarian crisis and a pressing need for immediate assistance.\n\nAs news of this catastrophe spreads, the entire nation mourns the loss and extends its heartfelt condolences to the affected families. The tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the fragile nature of life and the importance of unity in the face of adversity. The [KHI.GetAdjective] government must act swiftly and decisively to provide relief, support, and hope to those affected by this natural disaster."
khiva.100.a: "A tragedy for the entire nation!"

khiva.110.t: "United Turkestan"
khiva.110.d: "With [GetRulingParty] finally declaring the all-Turkestan national government and successfully liberating Bukhara and Fergana, the government is struggling with overextended bureacracy and administration. The remnants of both Jadidist and socialist organisations in former independent countries are now trying to fully integrate into the new system, while somewhat similar, but still different.\n\nWith our Jadidist party at helm, the most important question arises is what to do with the socialist opposition - the ERK, which for a long time advocated united Turkestan ideology and their leadership claiming to be the only legitimate government of Turkestan. Last, but not the least problem is the existence of other various Jadidist liberal groups, that demand representation and restructuring of our Khiva-centered apparatus."
khiva.110.a: "We must find solutions."

khiva.111.t: "Fate of the ERK"
khiva.111.d: "The ERK party, or Socialist Party of Turkestan, was one of the main proponents of Pan-Turkism and socialism in our region, having various factions and branches. In Khiva, they were mainly represented by Atabayev's YHP party, who was a part of a coalition with ERK. With the liberation of all Turkestan, the question now arises, whether we should allow the ERK movement to exist, as they are highly opposed to our rule."
khiva.111.a: "ERK should be banned!"
khiva.111.b: "We respect democratic opposition."

khiva.112.t: "Integration With Jadidist Parties"
khiva.112.d: "While it was believed that the Turkestan's Milliy Ittihod movement would be the uniting force of all Jadidist movement, as they long provided shelter to the exiled Young Khivans and Young Bukharans, eventually it was us, who liberated the region from conservatism and decay. Some of our ministers believe that we should be the only benefactors from this and found a new movement to represent all Jadidists in Turkestan. The others, however, suggest that we should not absorb the other parties and leave them be as local organisations in their respected regions."
khiva.112.a: "Found a unifying force of Jadidists."
khiva.112.b: "The Young Khivans were behind liberation!"

khiva.113.t: "Fate of the Khan"
khiva.113.d: "While we initially agreed to remain a constitutional monarchy under Sayid Abdullah-khan, with the unification of Turkestan, not all share the same opinion as before. For a large amount of people monarchy remains a symbol of oppression, even if our Khan is merely a figurehead. The opposition, both in our party, and among other Jadidists, suggest that we should immediately abolish the monarchy and finally throw off these shackles of the past, that prevented Khiva from modernizing."
khiva.113.a: "The Khan remains - we are a modernized monarchy."
khiva.113.b: "The times of Khans and Emirs is truly over."

khiva.114.t: "Extraordinary Elections"
khiva.114.d: "The government has decided that considering unification of Turkestan, it would be wise to hold new elections in the Majlis, in order to form a new government that would represent all population of our country. The elections are to be held in 2 months."
khiva.114.a: "Wise decision."

khiva.115.t: "Yatlama Güni"
khiva.115.d: "The Memorial Day or Yatlama Güni in Turkmen, will become the first national holiday of Turkmenistan and will be celebrated on January 12. This date was chosen in honor of the events that took place in 1881.\n\nOn this day, the Russian army successfully stormed the fortress of Geok Tepe. The assault was meticulously planned and led by Mikhail Skobelev. A force of 13,000 soldiers marched towards the fortress, with 7,000 participating in the actual assault. Despite the losses of 398 men, the fortress was captured.\n\nFor a long time after this event, the region where Geok Tepe was located remained a source of concern for Russia. There was a risk of increased British influence in the Caspian region, which Russia could not tolerate. Additionally, raids by Tekin tribes on Russian-controlled areas required urgent action. As a result of three Russian campaigns in the Akhal-Tekin oasis, the latest of which ended in the capture of the fortress of Geok Tepe, a total of approximately 30,000 defenders were reported to have been present in the fortress. These included 10,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry. Lieutenant Colonel Gaidarov successfully captured the western wall of the fortress. The enemy forces offered fierce resistance, but after a prolonged battle, they were forced to retreat through the northern passages. A portion of them remained in the citadel and fought to the end, while the rest fled. Skobelev chased the retreating forces for 15 versts (approximately 16 km).\n\nDuring the entire siege and assault, Russian losses amounted to approximately 1,400, including 400 during the assault. Inside the fortress, up to 5,000 women and children were found, as well as 500 Persian slaves and loot estimated at 6 million rubles.\n\nThis holiday is observed in commemoration of those who have lost their lives. It will be celebrated as a day of national mourning with national flags being lowered. Funerals will be held in mosques and ritual meals will be served throughout the country."
khiva.115.a: "We will never forget."

khiva.116.t: "The Great Boyar"
khiva.116.d: "To be honest, Turkmen literature is not particularly prolific, but in recent months, due to national development, a number of writers have emerged. Although printing facilities are still underdeveloped, these publications are often published in Bukhara and Tashkent and then imported and distributed by the author. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been informed about a new best-selling Turkmen novel, titled \"The Great Boyar\" (\"Uly Boyar\").\n\nHowever, it is not just the novel itself that is notable, but also the person who wrote it. The author of the work in question turned out to be Beknazar Khan Hadjiev, a veteran of the Savage Division, a volunteer Muslim unit that fought alongside Russia during the Weltkrieg and became part of an army under General Lavr Kornilov, a renowned hero of the Russian Civil War. It was as adjutant to General Kornilov that Beknazar Khan had served. Kornilov himself always referred to his adjutant as \"Khan\". During the revolution, Khan Hadjiev, along with a hundred others, formed Kornilov's escort during his stay at the Moscow State Conference. During the infamous 'Bykhov Sitting', Khan Hadjiev was a confidant of Kornilov and carried out many of his tasks, as well as guarding the prisoners. Afterwards, he became a veteran of the Ice March and went through the entirety of the civil war with General Kornilov. After its conclusion, he returned to Turkmenistan and joined the service of Oraz-Serdar, his former commander of the Savage Division. He handed over to him the battle flag of the valorous Turkmen cavalry regiment, that he carried through the civil war.\n\nThe new author became interested in writing and wrote a novel of 397 pages about the idol of his turbulent fighting youth. In this work, the author provides interesting information about the White Army. The author intersperses the prose of military life with a captivating description of retired officers.\n\nOrdinary Turkmen cavalrymen, who in a tragic period of history stood up to protect Russia, are the subject of debate within the government. On the one hand, some see this as glorifying the colonial empire. However, others see it as a positive work from a literary perspective, contributing to our cultural identity."
khiva.116.a: "Seize and burn everything!"
khiva.116.b: "Let them read it. The time will come for the glorification of true heroes."

khiva.117.t: "Yomud Horse Breeders"
khiva.117.d: "A visitor to the Grand Bazaar of Khiva can rarely pass the stalls of the horse merchants without hearing the claim that their breeds are ‘so swift, wars have been fought over them.' While one would be right to mistrust such assertions, it just so happens that the men of Khiva are correct, whether they know it or not. Thousands of years ago, the Turkmen tribesmen bred horses whose speed, resilience, endurance, and suitability for mounted archery was unmatched. Han Chinese Emperors named this breed the “heavenly horse” and made war against the ancient Scythian oasis with the express goal of stealing away enough of these “heavenly horses” to improve their own breeding stock. Much later, the Russians would call these horses Argamaks, or “divine horses,” noting their speed, stamina, and loyalty. Of these Turkmen horses, each tribe favors specific characteristics, creating the Yomud Horse, the Tekke, the Goklan, and Nokhorli; the lineage of each individual horse held in an oral record of pedigree. While it is widely held that the Yomud and the Goklan are the fastest due to their lighter builds, the Tekke horses have the best endurance, comparable only to the finest pure-bred Arabs."
khiva.117.d2: "[ROOT.GetLeader] has personally taken to investing into the horse breeding efforts of the Khanate, as the Turkmen breeds serve him in two ways: their clandestine sale to some interested European aristocrats helps to bring western capital into the city, while their ability as desert war-horses is unmatched. Of course, the Yomuds, raised alongside the young [ROOT.GetLeader] in the Aral Sea grazing grounds, are favored by our leader, filling the stables of both the bazaars and the barracks."
khiva.117.a: "Our soldiers will ride to victory!"
khiva.117.b: "They are the backbone of our logistics!"

Junaid-Khan, chief of the Yomud tribe, dictator of Khwarezm, was born under the name of Gurbanmammet. He came to be called Junaid-Khan because he was able to protect the honor and rights of his villagers, whether they were poor or rich. Junaid soon became a well-known and popular warlord, leader of the united Turkmen tribes. Backed by German-Turkish intelligence, he managed to gather 15 thousand men to initiate a rebellion against the Tsarist government, but it failed and he fled Khiva.\n\nIn 1917, after the wave of revolution in Russia reached Khiva, Junaid-Khan returned to become one of the most influential people in the Khanate, appointed commander of the armed forces. He used his power and influence to orchestrate coup d'etat and murder Isfandiyar-khan, enthroning his brother and heir, Sayid Abdullah-khan as a puppet.\n\nThe following decade was a difficult period for Junaid-Khan, who ruled as a sole dictator. He faced opposition from Jadidists and discontented Uzbeks, as well as industry and infrastructure decayed. In his last years Junaid began to prepare his son Eshi-Khan to become his heir either as a country's Vizier, or to even found a new royal dynasty in the Khorezm."

Azis, the son of a warrior leader of the Bagshi-Mirish tribe, was born in 1887 in Ahalyñ Herrikgala village. With the beginning of the Weltkrieg, when the Tsarist government tried to mobilize Turkmens for war, he became one of the leaders of the armed rebels against the recruitment. Azis-khan, together with his most loyal men, first hid in the lower reaches of Tejen, then traveled to Persia and then to Afghanistan. After the February Revolution, Azis-khan returned to Tejen. As in all parts of Turkestan, dual power reigned here. Looting and theft increased, famine set in. Elders, mullahs, rich people, peasants asked Azis-khan to lead the people in Tejen. After that they began to unite more firmly around him. For a short time he was on the side of the Bolsheviks, but soon switched to the side of the rebels and served under the command of Oraz Serdar in the militia. But he did not follow anyone's orders, did not obey anyone. Azis was a child of harsh times, adhering to the principle of \"whoever is not with us is against us\". Having consolidated his power in the Tejen oasis, Azis-Khan forbade the export of grain from Tejen despite the orders of the authorities. He succeeded in protecting the human dignity of the Tejen people and he did not hesitate to do anything when necessary.\n\nAfter Junaid Khan subjugated the whole Transcaspian region, Azis Khan became his associate and helped in many ways in uniting the Turkmen tribes, even though they had not yet fully realized themselves as a single nation."

After graduating from a Russian-Indigenous school, he enrolled in the Orenburg Cadet Corps and later attended the Moscow Infantry Military Academy. Hajy Myrat started his service in the Turkestan Rifle Brigade and later became a captain of the Teke cavalry regiment in 1917.\n\nFollowing the 1917 Revolutions, he was sought after by both the Red and White factions. Initially, he served as the 1st Comrade (Deputy) of the Chairman of the pro-Bolshevik 'Regional Congress of Delegates of County Turkmen Committees'. However, he eventually joined the White Army government in Transcaspia. During this period, the Turkmen Committee was established and led by him, which brought together various Turkmen leaders of the region, including former Tsarist generals such as Oraz Serdar, Seyitmurat Ovez Bayev, and Nikolai Yomudskiy. In order to achieve their objectives, he had to collaborate with General Malleson of the British mission in Transcaspia. However, unlike Oraz Serdar, he was against a military alliance with the British and instead preferred to cooperate with the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAfter the war, it was evident that Junaid-Khan had strengthened his position. Hajy Myrat recognized this and worked closely with him as a knowledgeable and respected advisor on Turkmen matters. Following the passing of his esteemed colleague, Oraz Serdar, Hajy Myrat assumed the position of 'khan' of the Merv oasis, a territory bestowed upon him by Junaid-Khan in opposition to another Turkmen warlord, Azis-Khan. While Hajy Myrat possesses greater expertise in military strategy and intellectual pursuits than Azis-Khan, they both aspire to the same goal: the establishment of a sovereign Turkmen State."
POLITICS_ESHI_KHAN_DESC: "Son of Junaid-Khan, Eshi-Khan has been the closest associate of his father and a warlord since 1918. Despite the fact that his father was neither a legitimate nor formal monarch, Eshi always behaved like a crown prince, as heir to the throne of Khwarezm. He was too young to prove himself on the fields of civil war, but he was able to prove himself as a manager, even if his leadership as a warlord was not overly recognized by the Turkmens. Coming to power as his father's heir, Eshi would seek to continue his legacy and hope to build a great state that would be unrivaled."

At the age of 26, he traveled to the Ottoman Empire to study at the prestigious University of Constantinople, where he was introduced to the enlightening ideas of Jadidism and formed many meaningful connections. In 1918, he returned to Khiva, where he encountered local Jadidists and joined their movement. After Junaid-Khan consolidated his power and repressed the Young Khivans, Bekjon, like others, went into exile in Turkestan. However, he remained a popular figure in the Jadidist movement and taught at a Jadid school in Tashkent. As the new leader of Khiva, Bekjon aims to modernize and improve the country, at last."

Sayid Abdullah-khan is the Khan of Khiva of the Qungrat dynasty, from 1 October 1918. After the previous Khan was murdered during Junaid-Khan's coup, he was enthroned in his place. However, he had no real power and served as a source of legitimacy for the Junaid-Khan's rule. For many years he was almost under house arrest in the palace of Nurullaboy, forced to participate in public events. He's known to for his naivety and overall weakness. Sayid never was taught how to be a real monarch and should the opposition seize power, he can at most become another Titular Khan in the hands of more ambitious and powerful people."

KHI_khan_army: "Junaid-Khan's Host"
KHI_khan_army_desc: "For centuries, the Khanate's military comprised a peasant militia, palace guards, and a vast network of rural tribes serving as vassals. Junaid-Khan gained prominence by securing the allegiance of these tribes. However, the complex political landscape, lack of discipline, and Junaid-Khan's reliance on tribal appeasement impede modernization efforts."
KHI_turkmen_identity: "Turkmen Tribes"
KHI_turkmen_identity_desc: "The Turkmen tribes, scattered from Khwarezm to the Caspian and Aral Seas, historically lacked a collective identity. Junaid-Khan's heroism in uniting these disparate tribes against the Bolsheviks laid the foundation for a unified Turkmen identity. Despite Junaid-Khan's authority, challenges arise, particularly from southern Turkmen tribes, possibly backed by the Ottomans.

KHI_abandoned_infrastructure: "Decaying Urban Infrastructure"
KHI_abandoned_infrastructure_desc: "Junaid-Khan's policies, favoring rural and Turkmen populations, have left much of Khiva's urban and Uzbek-dominated infrastructure in disrepair.

To revive our economy, we must take measured steps to rebuild functional infrastructure, perhaps even embracing small-scale industrialization."

KHI_Turkmen_Identity: "Developing Turkmen Identity"
KHI_Turkmen_Identity_desc: "For centuries Khiva was an Uzbek state. And that meant that the state language was Chagatai, the ruling elite were Uzbeks, and minorities received no benefits.\n\nSince Junaid-Khan, a Turkmen from the Yomud tribe, came to power, everything changed. Now the minority ruled the majority. But things changed even more dramatically when the vast Trans-Caspian region, populated predominantly by Turkmen, came under the rule of the Turkmen leader.\n\n\nNow Khiva is an archaic state, stuck in antiquity without any modernization of social life. In recent years, Junaid-Khan has been losing both his legitimacy and prestige among the population of his state. However, on the advice of one of his cronies, Azis-Khan Chapyk, to raise his prestige and legitimacy, Junaid-Khan needed an ideology capable of rallying people around his figure. And quite naturally, this ideology is Turkmen nationalism. \n\nBut the development of this ideology and the full-fledged creation of the Turkmen state requires much effort to unite these disparate and warring tribes and nurture in them a unified Turkmen identity.\n\nStatus of §nTurkmen Identity:§!
